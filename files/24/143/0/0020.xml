SECRET.LTION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT, NO.  XX.                      REVIEW OE THE NEAR. EASTERN SITUATION.!i      IT is perhaps opportune to reconsider the  effect of the Russian Revolution upon  the Near and Middle Eastern situation as a whole.       Not only has the military effectiveness  of Russia been impaired  at a time when a Russian  offensive  in the Caucasus might have finally brought  the Young Turks  toI their knees, but the  whole political objective of Russia has been diverted from externalI to internal aims.  This change  of policy has involved the surrender, for the time being1 at any rate, of Russia&apos;s claim to the  annexation  of Constantinople and the Straits, theI inability or  unwillingness of Russia to rescue Armenia from Turkish  oppression, and1 the practical reversal of Russian policy in  Persia.       While the surrender of any idea of territorial acquisition of the Straits may make it easier for Turkey to come to  terms with the Entente  Powers, there is no doubt thatI the virtual removal of Russian  military pressure has given the Turks renewed hope  in1 their ability to  retain the Arab and Armenian provinces of the Empire.       The internal political and economic condition of Turkey is undoubtedly deplorable,I and the reported restiveness of the Turkish ruling class (the C. U. P.) against GermanI financial and political domination is probably true.   But against these feelings we mustI place the perpetual  fear  of  Bulgaria,  and  Bulgar aspirations  regarding  Adrianople,  which tend to prevent munitionless Turkey breaking with a neighbour who can be fedI with men and material from Central Europe.I      One can but think that the detachment of Turkey can only  be accomplished by theI simultaneous detachment of Bulgaria.:ji      How important  such a detachment might  prove to be can best be seen by lookingI at a  map of the three Old-World continents together.  The curiously-shaped  OttomanU Empire is the link between the three great continents.  The control of this  area givesM the controller the essential strategic and economic  mastery of  the  communications&quot;j between the Mediterranean Sea and  the Indian Ocean, between  Asia and Africa, and of  the natural outlet for more than half Russia&apos;s agricultural produce besides the produce  of her great undeveloped southern coalfield.        *       For these strategic reasons, as well as for the  exploitation of the vast colonisable  and  undeveloped lands of Asia  Minor, Syria,  and  Mesopotamia,  Germany&apos;s &quot; Welt-  politik &quot; involved the absorption of  the Ottoman Empire  into German  Mittel-Europa.  German control of  Bulgaria and Turkey strikes at the vitals of the  British Empire.  The  Hejaz Railway turns the flank of our Suez Canal defences, and but for the action  of the  Sherif of Mecca would have brought our enemies to the Red Sea.  The Bagdad  Railway is a German arrow pointed directly at India.       There  are  four possible  lines  of  defence  for  the British Empire  against this  threatened expansion of Mittel-Europa into Mittel-Asien.  The first line runs through  Sofia ;  the second through the Straits ;  the third runs  from Trebizond to the Gulf of  Alexandretta ;  and   the fourth involves our holding  the railway termini of Bir Saba,  Medina, and Bagdad.       The order  selected  is,  the order in which our  security is the more  effectively  maintained.         [898-47]
     Over  and above these vital considerations of political  if not  also of  militarystrategy, we cannot lose sight of the importance to the future of the British Empire ofthe  present  division  of two great  world-forces, both  of which are  centred  in whathave hitherto been outlying provinces of Turkish dominion, viz., Islam and Jewry.     Islam is  centred in Mecca, and the Sovereign of. the Holy Cities of Islam is thenatural centre to  which Pan-Islamism  and kindred ideas either consciously or uncon-sciously gravitate.  In our settlement with Turkey at the end of this  war not only arethe  hopes  and aspirations of the Arab nation concerned, but also religious orientationof 100 million Moslem subjects of the King-Emperor in Asia and Africa.   Our position,if the Turk is allowed to  get  back  to  Mecca, gives one  furiously to think.   The thenattitude of the Arabs will not be limited by a sentiment of &quot; Perfide Albion.&quot;     As Islam has been  divided  by the  revolt of the  Chief of the Descendants of theProphet, so Jewry has been divided  during this  war as never before.   The EntentophilJew, to the majority of whom  Zion is the  centre  of their hope, is urgent  to securethe  delivery  of  the  land of  his  forefathers  from the  Turk;  while those  who areconsciously or unconsciously  Pro-Germ m  seek to secure the maintenance  of  thestatus quo  ante lest a  Christian Power rule in Palestine.  Then, it must be added that,just as Germany is the home  of Anti-Semitism, Germany is also the chief centre ofAssimilation, and the chief enemy of growing Jewish nationalism.     If we  may be tempted to draw conclusions  from the above review, it would  seemessential that we should realise  that so far from the Russian revolution having lightenedour commitments in the East, it forces us the more to secure for ourselves such lines ofdefence for the British Empire as may prevent the German hegemony or penetration of South-Western Asia-.  If the first and  second lines of defence are now unattainablefor military reasons, the third becomes more important, as contentment with  the fourthline (even this has not yet been  secured) would hand over to Turkey and  her Germanmasters the Arabs and the Zionists, and would sooner or later involve the BritishEmpire in  another struggle for existence, at any rate, as  far as  its  Asiatic and North -East African territories are concerned.  If our declared war aims mean anything, surelyArmenia has the same claim to liberation as Belgium, and a peace  is  impossible whichleaves the  very natural alliance  between the German ruling  classes and  the Young-Turks in control of Syria, Palestine,  and other Arabic-speaking  portions of the ottoman empire.     The separation of Syria and Palestine from  the control  of. a Power  dominated or controlled  by Germany is the only security that can assure our position in Bagdad andalong the Red Sea.   It is the only security for  the future independence  of the  holy places of Islam and of an Arab State friendly to this country.   It is the only securitythat will   ensure  an  Ententophil solution of  the Palestine question and  which will prevent Zionism being thrown  into  the  arms of the King  of Prussia.   The  germans are at this moment making a bid to  capture Zionism.     Let us never  forget the late Lord Salisbury&apos;s dictum that,  in trusting Turkey, &quot;we put our money on the wrong horse.&quot;  With Turkey established in the Straits, she can afford  to  disregard any arrangements  regarding  the administration of her subjectprovinces  which  she may promise for the sake of a temporary peace.  If Turkey is toretain the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles she must lose Alexandretta and everything eastand south  of it, for then only are we safeguarded against  the expanding pressure of thetwo aggressive military States, Prussia  of the Junkers and Turkey of the  Young Turks.

Buchanan on the 7th June[No. 1176] that he agreed to the substitution of a new note on the lines suggested.     The text of the new note as communicated to the press is as follows :      On the 3rd May His Majesty&apos;s  Government received through the  Russian Charged&apos;Affaires a note from the Russian Government declaratory of their war policy.     In the proclamation to the  Russian people, enclosed in the note, it is said that&quot; Free Russia does not purpose to  dominate other peoples, or to take from  them their national patrimony, or forcibly to  occupy foreign  territory.&quot;  In  this sentiment  theBritish Government heartily concur.  They did not enter upon this war  as a war ofconquest, and they are not continuing it for any such object.  Their purpose at the outset was to defend the existence of their  country, and to  enforce  respect  for inter-natiorial engagements.  To those objects has now been added that  of liberating popula-tions opjoressed by  alien tyranny.   They heartily rejoice, therefore, that  Free Russiahas announced, her intention of liberating Poland, not only the Poland ruled by the oldRussian autocracy, but equally that within the dominion of the Germanic empires.   Inthis enterprise the British democracy wish Russia  God-speed.   Beyond everything wemust seek for such a settlement as will  secure the happiness and contentment  of the peoples,  and take away all legitimate causes of future war.     The British  Government heartily join their Bussian allies in their acceptance  and approval of the principles laid down by President Wilson in his historic message to theAmerican  Congress.   These are the  aims for which the British  people  are fighting.These are the principles by which their war policy is and will be  guided.   The  BritishGovernment believe that, broadly speaking, the agreements which they have from timeto time made with their allies  are conformable to these standards.  But if the RussianGovernment so desire they are quite ready with their allies to examine and, if need be,to revise, these agreements.     The note actually presented appears from the following telegrams to  differ in come degree from tbe above.  On  tbe 9th June, Lord R.. Cecil  telegraphed  [No. 1190] to       [898-47]                                                          B
Sir G. Buchanan saying  that  he proposed to make the  following alterations  in  theform of the note as published here :     Second paragraph not to be broken at the words &quot;God-speed,&quot; but sentence imme-diately following from &quot; Beyond everything&quot; to &quot;future war&quot;  to  be tacked on  to it.Next  paragraph to begin with the words &quot; The British Government,&quot; omitting expres-sion &quot; in  a word,&quot;  which implies  obvious  excisions.   Peroration  beginning &quot; These arethe aims &quot; to follow immediately after the words &quot; American Congress &quot;  without a breakof paragraph.    To this Sir G. Buchanan replied [No. 872] on  the following day that he had sentin the note immediately after receiving Lord R. Cecil&apos;s telegram of the 7th June, and ithad been already published.    The Ukraine. In a despatch [No.  31]  dated the 30th April the consul-general atOdessa said that a congress of the several Little Russian political parties had  been heldat Kieff for the purpose of establishing and settling their  programme and the  basis ofthe autonomy of  the Ukraine  as  one of  the  states  in  the proposed  FederatedRepublican States of Russia.   The following resolution was adopted : &quot; Confirmatoryto the historical and contemporary concrete needs  of the people of the Ukraine, thisassembly lays down that the  national territorial  autonomy of the  Ukraine  alone  can assure the needs of the Little Russian nation and of the other nationalities dwelling inthe Ukraine.  Such an autonomy in the Ukraine,  and also in other autonomous parts ofRussia,  will  have full guarantee in a federal  form of government in  Russia.   Thisassembly therefore  considers that a federated democratic  republic is the  only  possibleform of national government. .    A further resolution adopted was that the agrarian question in the Ukraine shouldbe  decided  by  the  Ukraine &quot; Seim&quot; after  the realisation of the  autonomy of  theTJ kraine.   The dangers of this resolution, which evidently meant that the rich black-earth zone of Russia was to be severely confined  to its present inhabitants, would bedealt  with in a future despatch on the agrarian question.    The  boundaries of the Ukraine put forward  at the congress were as follows :  Onthe north the Pripet ; on the south the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, excluding thesouthern shore of the Crimea;  on the west the Government of Lublin and Grodno,  andon the  south-east  the Kuban territory, and including the Governments of Kherson,Poltava,  Podolia, Kherson, Volhynia, Kharkov, Ekaterinoslav, and Chernigov (with theexception of four districts j&quot; uyezdi &quot;] populated by Great  Russians), and certain  LittleRussian  districts.in  the  Governments of Lublin,  Seidlitz, Grodno,  Kursk,  Voronej,Bessarabia,-,Don Territory, and the Kuban,.or an  area of  513,000 square  versts.   Thisterritory had- a-;population of 30,000,000, of whom 75 per cent, were Little  Russians,11 per cent. Great -Russians, 8 per cent. Jews, 2 per cent. Poles, and 2 per cent.  Germancolonists.&apos;   C.&apos;&apos; -.    .rj^i I&apos;    . The claims of the Poles that the territory contiguous to Poland, such as the Govern-mehis&apos; of Yolhynia &quot;and. Podolia, with a large Polish population, should be included intlie; future.autonomousPoland was indignantly rejected.    In connection with this national movement an assembly of professors and school-masters &apos;6f the&quot;Ukraine was: also  held.  As regards higher education it was decided(l)&apos;xo&apos;.request professors to deliver their lectures in the Ukraine language ;  (2) to foundsecondary schoolsVas soph; .as.possible, their cost and upkeep to be a charge on the  State,and&apos; to -make: the&apos;teaching .of rthe  language,  history,  and  literature  of the Ukrainecbmpiilsory&apos;;  (3).in schools&apos;  where the majority of the  pupils were Little Russians, allleSsbhs iii the lower&apos; classes&apos;should be given in the native language; the Ukrainising insiriglenlass^ehBmentaryvSchpols should commence with the new school year.  (4) Russianshould billy be taught in the third year of school  life.  The resolution in favour of the teaching of Russian&apos; in elementary schools was passed by a large majority. f:l&apos; Bessarabia.-In thesame  despatch [No. 36] the consul-general at Odessa said thata&apos;,.movement,.. on;.- .sixpilar . Hires - wasdtaking  place  in Bessarabia, where  the Moldavianpppulatiop; demanded; the autonomy - of  Bessarabia and  the  full recognition of  theMoldavian: language;.&apos;,&apos;;Resolutions:,to.;-this  effect had  been passed by  a congress inKi shin eff.  ;  y   &apos;:;   ^hthbiifits  iasiklfol    Kronsiaolt. Sir G.  Buchanan telegraphed  on the  7th  June  [No.  850]  thatM.,Terestchenko-;had:info&apos;rmed.him; that the mission of MM. Tseretelli and Skobelef had
    been completely successful ;  the Workmen&apos;s  Council  had apparently been cowed by    M. Tseretelli&apos;s firm language, and had made  a  complete surrender.   He telegraphed    again on the 8th June [No. 859] that he had  been informed by M. Terestchenko that    ratification of the decision of the local Workmen&apos;s Council to  submit to the Provisional    Government had been refused by a mass meeting  of sailors and  other inhabitants of 11 Kronstadt, and  that in  consequence the Council  had addressed a letter to Petrograd    maintaining  its original resolution to break  with the  Government; the Council of    Ministers had decided to isolate Kronstadt, but4 as  there  were considerable reserves of    provisions, some little time might elapse before it surrendered.  On the following day    he telegraphed  again [No. 870] saying that M. Terestchenko had informed him that the    Workmen&apos;s Council  had approved and were supporting the action of the Government    in  the Kronstadt question.   Telegraphing again  on the  11th  June,  he said that    M. Terestchenko had informed him  that, although Kronstadt had not made complete    submission, of the six training ships  there, two  had left  as  ordered, two were on the    point of leaving, and the other two had  been declared unable to leave on account of    defects in their machinery ; a commission was  being sent to verify the latter statement.         Mr.  Ramsay Macdonald. On   the   7th June,  Sir  G.  Buchanan  transmitted    [No. 849] a telegram from  Mr. Henderson saying that he had discussed the question of    a passport being granted to Mr.  Macdonald with M. Terestchenko, who was strongly of    opinion that representatives of all the Labour groups ought to be allowed to come to-    Petrograd.   He did  not believe that men like  Mr.  Macdonald wTould do any real harm,    and the proceedings  of the Russian extremists might serve as an object lesson to them.    Refusal of passports would, he feared,  seriously  compromise   the  success of his-    (Mr. Hendersoifs) work in Russia.         Lord B, Cecil replied  on  the 9th June [No. 1193] that Mr. Macdonald  had been    granted a passport, and that  he  would start on the following day  unless he should be.    stopped by the action of the Seamen&apos;s Union.         Rumoured Visit of a Russian Official to Berne. On the 30th May Sir H.  Rumbold.    telegraphed [No. 425] that a  rumour had reached him of the arrival in Switzerland on    a peace mission of a  Russian  Under-Secretary of  State  who had obtained permission    to  travel through Germany.   Telegraphing again from Berne on the 9th June [No. 476],.    he said that enquiries had shown that the holder of an important position in Petrograd,    a  Socialist,  had  arrived  there ; he was  hoping to  obtain further information.  In    regard to the earlier of the above telegrams [No.  425] Sir G. Buchanan  telegraphed    [No. 878] from Petrograd on  the 11th June  saying  that there  was  no truth  in the    rumour.  M. Miliukof had sent an emissary to Switzerland to  get into touch with the-    Bulgarians, believing them to be contemplating peace  overtures;  from  this fact the^    rumour might have  arisen.         The  Jews  and  Great  Britain. Sir G. Buchanan, in a despatch  [No. 109] dated    the 6th May, transmitted reports, dated the  23rd  April, from  the British  vice-consul    at Nieolaieff, in the district  of the  consul-general- at Odessa.  Mr. Brown said that    the Jews, the   trading and  commercial community  in  particular,  were in  favour of    peace  at almost any price.  They had not been slow, he  said, to grasp that should the    Allies be victorious  there  would be very  great danger  of a preferential tariff being    given  them, and the Jews  would then be faced with the  serious competition  of  British    capitalists and manufacturers ; and it was  British competition that they feared.         Proposed Siberian Railway.  [See  Eastern Report  XIX, p.  4]. M.  van  Taysen     (the originator of the scheme for a railway from Obdorsk to a  point  on the Arctic     Ocean), has  been  informed that,  after  most careful  consideration, Her   Majesty&apos;s    Government had come to the conclusion that it would  be inexpedient to proceed with     such an enterprise at the present moment, as  (1) its financial success in the near future     would be problematical, and  (2;  from information received, it appeared that the  scheme     would not  commend  itself to  the Russian   Government.    Further,  the ^ direct    advantage  to this country did not appear  to be sufficient to justify its giving financial     support.    &apos;*                                         POLAND.         Distress of  the Inhabitants. Sir  G. Buchanan  telegraphed on  the   8th  June    [No. 8571 that M. Terestchenko (who had several times spoken of the sufferings of the            [898-47]                                     &apos;                  B 2
Poles, then on the verge of starvation) had sent him  a memorandum, to the effect thatPolish organisations in Russia had approached the Prime  Minister with a request thatthe consent of the allied Governments might be obtained for the export from Switzerlandto Poland of sufficient rice to meet the most pressing needs of the population, which wasin the greatest  distress.  Tihe  German Government .had consented  to  transmit thisconsignment to Poland and had guaranteed that it should be devoted exclusively to thelocal population, and the Polish-communal organisations had given  guarantees  to thesame effect.   The Ministry  for Foreign. Affairs would  be  grateful for an early  reply.When speaking on this -subject M. Terestchenko had said that, apart from humanitarianmotives, he considered that we ought to do everything possible  to encourage the anti-German feeling among the Poles, which was  never stronger than now.  Several leadingPoles had spoken to Sir G. Buchanan in the same, sense and had told :him that, only some600 men had been recruited by the Germans out of the millions capable of bearing arms.                                    TURKEY.     Mr.  Morgenthau.. [See Eastern Beport XVIII, p.  5];    Sir  C.  Spring-Ricetelegraphed from Washington on the llth June [No. 1635] saying that Mr. Morgenthauwas not very sanguine but thought that Eyoub &quot;Sabri and Sinoum could be the meansof communication with the Turks,  if he  could obtain their release from Malta.  he expected to leave by a Spanish steamer on the 16th  June.   He hoped to go to  egypt and thence,  on Jewish business, to Palestine.  He thought that the Turks would make him some offer, and he would prefer their taking the first steps.  He insisted on the need of secrecy.  The State Department thought the experiment worth trying but it was not-sanguine.  Caution was to be recommended.   Mr. Morgenthau  had  informed theFrench Ambassador.                                 SOMALIiLAND.     German Occupation of  Guda. Mr. Thesiger- telegraphed  on the 5th June thatGuda on  the  French  Somali  coast was occupied &quot;by  the German mission which hadunited with the  rebel Danakill  chief.  Mr. Thesiger suggested that assistance should begiven by the Somaliland Protectorate  and from Assab by the  Italians, as  the Frenchappeared to have mi troops.   Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 10th June [No. 610]that he concurred in this suggestion.                                  PALESTINE.    xUelief for the Jews.-[Eastern Report XVI, p.  .8].  Sir R,  Wingate  telegraphedon the 10th June &quot;No.  607]  that a committee had been formed with the sanction  of themilitary authorities; the distribution  of the  funds would be controlled by the latter in-common with  all other funds  remitted from Egypt to enemy or.neutral countries.  SirMark Sykes agreed that the Dutch diplomatic^ and consular officers would probably bethe best  channel for  distribution.; and  the  Netherlands  Minister,  when privatelyappi&apos;oached, expressed his willingness to assist, if authorised by his Government.  Fundssnould be sent to M. Jacques Mosseri  (Secretary of the Cairo Zionist Committee).                                     PERSIA.     The new  Cabinet. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the  6th June [No. 196]  that  a Cabinet had Been -formed  by  Aia-es-Sultaneh.   He  and three other members were moderate in their  views and  generally  well  disposed, but they were  men of weak character and only held minor posts.   The other  five, particularly the Ministers of Finance and the Interior, gave great support to the Germans in 1915 ;  they represented the party which brought about the resignation of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh, were active and unscrupulous, and w^ould rule -their weaker colleagues.  HisRussian colleague had received general  instructions to show sympathy with democracy, and  these  instructions were responsible in a large measure  for this unfortunate combination.     Moratorium Payments.-In the same telegram [No. 196], Sir C. Marling said that he proposed informing the Government, which was embarrassed for money,  that he did not feel justified in authorising the  bank to  pay the May instalment till he had received definite pledges that the policy of benevolent neutrality would be abandoned.   On the llth June, Lord R. Cecil telegraphed [No.  157] approving this.
    The Democratic Policy. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 9th June [No. 198]in regard to the democrat policy.   The  success of the democrats, he said, pivoted onthe relations of the two neighbouring Powers, and, Russia being for the time paralysed,the; democrats recognised that British influence was the only support of the moderates,and held us up as the oppressor from whose yoke they would free  Persia, our friendsbeing removed as traitors to this country.    On the 7th  June a  most important and  respected Teheran &quot; ecclesiastic&quot; wasmurdered.   He  had  been using his great  influence to bring about  the return of moderate and intelligent  deputies, and  was therefore credited with being a  friend ofGreat  Britain.   The crime  was  admittedly political, with  the two-fold  object ofsecuring the return of democratic deputies and terrorising our friends.  These murdersshowed that the attack on us would be pushed home, particularly in connection with our work  in the south.  He had  seen the Prime Minister on the previous day and  foundthat he knew nothing of the  situation or of the circumstances in which  he came, into office  : he was not even  aware that Sir  P. Sykes had  been recognised as working onbehalf of the Persian Government.  The Prime Minister could not  even tell Sir G.Buchanan his programme or, when asked for a promise that Farman Farma should be supported, go further than say vaguely that  there was no intention of interfering withhim.   Much, Sir  G. Buchanan  added, would depend  on  the attitude of the Russianminister after  his return; the  democrats  &quot;would  be  so  encouraged by  any show of sympathy that the reconsideration of our immediate policy would be necessary.    The Convention of 1907. Sir 0. Marling telegraphed on the 7th June  [No. 197]that it was probable that some move in the direction of inviting the Russian Govern-ment  to abrogate the agreement of last August and  the convention of 1907 would bemade by the Persian Government; it was already being urged in the press.                                     INDIA.    The Mahsuds.   [Eastern Report XVII, p. 6; XVIII, p. 8;   XIX, p.  5].-TheViceroy telegraphed on the  6th June  that the  idea of effecting a settlement was unanimously opposed by  Sir George   Roos-Keppel,   General Sir  A.  Barrett,  andGeneral  Beynon.   The  first-named of  these considered that, before negotiating, atleast one successful action was necessary ;  the effect of leaving the Mahsuds unpunishedafter their recent successes would be seriously deleterious on the other frontier  tribes.In view of the consensus of opinion, the  orders for the advance must.stand.ADDENDA.                                    RUSSIA.    The Socialist Press and the british note. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 12thJune [Nn. 885] that he had told M. Terestchenko how disappointed he had been by the language held by the Socialist press in regard to the French and British notes.  The press had seized on the passage about Alsace-Lorraine  in the French note to tax both  Govern-ments  with imperialistic aims, which was very unfair to us, who had, by omitting allreference to controversial questions, gone  out  of our way to meet his wishes.   He saidthat he knew  that the  Provisional  Government was  as  anxious  as  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment to bring their respective views into harmony; but there must be give and take if we were to succeed in this.  It would be well if the Socialist press, which seemedto think that it  could dictate the conditions of peace, could be made  to understand thatafter the sacrifices we had made we should not be content with terms which  did not secure permanent  peace, and  that we should  go on fighting until  we had  attainedthis end.    M. Terestchenko  replied that  he  agreed that  there  must be give  and take.The articles to which he (Sir G. Buchanan) had referred, had all appeared in papersrepresenting the views of the extremists or the left wing of the moderates.   Our notehad made a good impression on the moderate element of the Workmen&apos;s Council.  too much attention should not be paid to what was said  by extremists, who were but anoisy minority, and the feeling towards England was more friendly than towards any other
m.of the  allies.  M. Terestchenko spoke with his usual confidence of the  future, both inregard to the military and to the internal  situation, and although his optimism hardlyseemed justified, he had so often been right in the past that it was to be  hoped he might prove a true prophet.     The Army. -Sir G. Barclay telegraphed from Jassy on the 5th June [No. 307] a message for  the C.I.G.S.  from  the military attache to the effect that he had learnt,from a reliable source, that the  commander  of the 9th Bussian Army had been definitelyinformed that his men refused to take part in any offensive.

Mr. Grahame  telegraphed from  Paris on  the 13th June[No. 559] that the French Government had been informed by the Governor of FrenchSomaliland that the German mission was near Lake Mabol, in the region of the Gondalmountains ;  and  that the mission would no doubt  try to embark  for Arabia in  theSagallo region, as the tribes in the Obok region refused to allow it passage.

                 Raids on the Railway.              I. Abu Markka to  Abu el-Naam.    From  March 15  to  March  20  I  stayed in  Sidi Abdullah \scamp.   On Monday, March  26, we  started off at 7.50 a.m. forthe railway at Abu el-Naam.   With me were  Sherif Fauzan(Huritb, Emir of el-Modhiq),  Sherif  Suleima (Abdilla), SidiRaho  (Algerian  officer  in  French service), and  Mohammedel-Gadhi (Juheinah).  We  were joined shortly by Mufaddlil, aSelqa Anazeb  Sheikh.  Total force,  about thirty men.   We wentaway  down Wadi Ais till  8.50 a.m., when we turned slightly to the left, after rounding  the mouth of Wadi  Tleib coming  from thenorth-west.  At 9.20 a.m. we crossed to the right bank of the wadi,under a rock wall, and at 9.30 a.m. reached a corner and bore more to  the right.  This  is El-Marraha.  At  10 a.m. we  turned alittle  to  the left, and came out of the  narrows On to a broad                         ARABIA.                           Hejaz                         Intelligence.     There has not been  much  military information  this week.The Turks  still  hold  Bir el-Mashi in force, and  Fakhri Pashahimself  has  been  there.    Medina,  is said  to have more  sickthan sound soldiers in  it.   So far  as  we know, it  has not been reinforced, re-victualled, nor in any  way  relieved.   Abdullah&apos;sbands  continue to operate on  the southern section of the line,and  the  damage they do is reported often  not repaired for three or four days.  Further temporary destruction has been effectedbetween   Dar  el-Hamra  and  Moadhdham,  and  raiders  haveapparently been operating  also  still further north,  in  the Tebukdistrict.   The  Huweitat are reported to be  fighting with  two sections of the Beni Atiyah, which have, apparently,  not joined the  revolt ;   and  the same  report   mentioned  fighting&apos;  alsobetween  the  Turks and   the  Sibaa  Anazeh  and fladidin  ofHamah at  a point which is  probably Ranta  on the  Homs-Hamah railway, near a bridge  by which  the latter  crosses theOrontes.     Sir  Mark Sykes,  accompanied by Colonel Leachman,  hasvisited Wejh and Jeddah.   At the former, on May 3, he saw SidiFeisal  ;  at the latter,  on  May 5, King  Husein.  He reports theresults of both interviews to be satisfactory, inasmuch as the Hejazleaders have been brought  to understand that they have  to dealwith an  indivisible  Entente ;  that,  under whatever overlord,an enlightened progressive regime must be established in Syria ;and  that  certain  districts of the latter, which present  peculiardifficulties, must remain under special tutelage in any  event.
plain, formed by the confluence of the wadis from right  to  left.Just in front of us  was Bir  el-Amri,  about twenty feet deep ;water slightly brackish, but abundant.  The hills on the right,beyond the bend of  the  wadi,  are  high.   At  10.40 a.m.  wehalted under  a great sidr  tree,  and  spent the  mid-day there.Wadi Ais proved almost luxuriant with its thorn  trees and grass.There was  a cool  east wind, and  the  valley was full of whitebutterflies and the scents of flowers.     We mounted again at  3.40 pan., and  at 3.50 p.m.  reached  -an old wall, which  deflects the stream  of the wadi to  its  leftbank, and guards an  earth  terrace, about five  feet high, on  itssouth  side,  against floods.   The  wall  is constructed of chosenunhewn blocks, about a foot square each, and tolerably coursed.It is about a mile and a half long, and fairly solid.  Its  presentgreatest  height is about  four feet, but  it must  go  down some considerable depth  below  the wadi bed,  to withstand the floods.In the terrace,  about  400 yards wide, partitioned off by the wall,are remains of fields,  house-foundations, and a  large sunk water-basin, of correct masonry.   At 4.10 p.m. we left Wadi Ais, whichturned off northwards on  our left towards  Murabba.  We wentup a narrow valley into Jebel Serd.  At 4.45 p.m.  a valley came inon  the right ;  at 5.5 p.m. we  reached an easy  watershed  andcrossed the heads of a vallej&apos; flowing north  to  Wadi Ais.   at.15  p.m.  we crossed a second  watershed,  also  easy,  and wentdown  a  small valley  into W. Serun at 5.25  p.in.  We  campedhere for the night, watering from Ghadir Seriam (Moeit  Hefna),ten minutes away in the foothills east of us.Tuesday, March 27.     Started at 5.35 a.m. and crossed El-Mauggad  to the north endof J. Serd,  and went  up and down its first spur  by a very steep,sharp path  (there is  a much better road for guns, ten  minutessouth of our road, over J. Serd.)  This  took us down into a deepwadi, which we  crossed, and thence over a  second wadi  (Seilel-Howeiti) and a low divide, giving  on a side valley, up whichwe  wound to another steep  saddle at 7.3  a.m.,  and  a nastydescent into a long rough narrow valley leading  down into Wadi Turaa, which  enters Hamdh opposite the mouth of W. Tubja. We reached this W. Turaa at 7.45 a.m., and camped at 8.25 a.m. near Bir Fueir..  .W.  Turaa is a plain, bearing north-west, full of. trees, and grass, with a sandy surface, much cut up with seils.  One of these had filled in the well this  year, but waterpools exist in plenty in the hills, so that the  many tents in  the valley have no lack  of water.  Wadi Turaa is the  best way down  to  Wadi Yambo, and  Ras  el-Fura  (Kheif  Husein)  is  about  two  clays camel from here.  The  flat-toppecl  straight-sided hills on the north bank of the valhev are J. Dm. Rutba.  The valley is Urwa dira.      We  started  again  at  4.20 p.m.  and at  5.5 p.m.  turned  60o up a valley.   At 5.20 p.m. about 120o and  at 5.30 p.m, 60o  again,  up  the  upper  course of  W.  Turaa,  a broad smooth
- 209253road,  for  half  an  hour till we lost  the  way,  and wanderedabout the foothills, like  VirgiPs crippled snake,  till 6.40 p.m.,just across the watershed  of W.  Turaa and W. Meseiz.  Ourguides were at fault  in  bringing  us  (to be  near  some tents)too far  north from our first entry into the Turaa plain.  Thequickest and best road is  straight across  to Ain Turaa, and up  the  east branch of the  wacli direct to the watershed.Wednesday,, March 28.    Rode at 5.5 a.m.  past north end of J. Tareif and clown. W.Meseiz,  which is a steep, loose ramp of shingle and stones, scoreddeeply by water, unfit for wheeled traffic, into the great plain of el-Jurf, across  which W.  Meseiz  cuts its way east to  join W.Gussed, flowing north from  J. Agrad.  At  6.15  a.m. we  were well into el-Jurf, and going due east, with. J. Antar, a castellatedrock with a split head perched on a cone, most conspicuous about ten miles off to the south.   J. Jeddah, a group  of needles, layabout six miles off down W. Gussed beyond Aba el-Hellu.   Werode 90o till 7 a.m.  and then  140o till 7.40 a.m., and  campedunder  a tree  in  Wacli Gussed.   It is  very fertile  in  a  wildway indeed all. the  Jurf  is.   We were camped  nearly at thesouth end  of a tongue of hills,  which walls off el-Jurf  fromthe Hamclh valley.  To the south  el-Jurf opens into el-Magrah,up  wdiich the railway climbs to a watershed near  J. Bueir, andone comes clown to join the Hamdh at Abu  el-Naam ;  and ourown Wadi  Guad., rising a little further west, in the foothills ofAzrad (where is water in themail), runs down north to  join theHamdh near Jedahah, after givingthe water-hole of Abu el-Hellaon  its passage through the  hills.  J. Tareif, prolonged by Azrad,forms a blank wall of hill to Bowat.   There is no way up it forcamels into the valleys beyond, except a difficult pass just southof our camp.    In the afternoon we went- up the Dhula of  Abu el-Naam,just behind the camp, and examined the railway and the station at 6,000 yards.  It has two large basalt and cement two-storeyedbuildings,  a circular  water-tower, and  a  small  house to thewest; and about the  houses  were  many bell tents and sheltertents.   The perimeter was  heavily entrenched, but there were nogrins  visible, and we  only saw about 300 men.   A trolley wentoff north with only one man on it, to the bridge over W. Hamdh,which Dakhilallah had attacked.  It was a large bridge, of about twenty arches of white stone, and  next to it were  some shelters,and on the top of a coal-black mound just north  of the bridge,some dozen white tents,  with Turkish  officers lounging in chairsbeside them.  At 2 p.m. a train (locomotive  reversed), came  in from the south.   It  had  four  water  cisterns  (improvised irontanks on trucks),  and four box-wagons, and after watering, wentoff north.   The  station  of Istabl Antar was clearly visible onthe Ras el-Magrah, but Jedahah was behind hills. Returned tocamp at sunset, after sending snipers  to Istabl  and Jedahah  to
stop night patrolling.   The Turks  had  been very  active latelyby night, but we succeeded in confining them to stations by  the simple means of firing shots in the air near the stations at night.They expected an attack, and therefore concentrated the men  inthe G.H.Q. and stood to arms in the trenches all night.Thursday, March 29.     Up at 5.20 a.m.   Very cold,  with  a  restless  dawn  windblowing down el-Jurf, singing in the great trees round our camp.We spent most of the day admiring Abu el-Naam from the hill-top.The garrison paraded,  and  we  counted  them  as  390  infantry,and twenty-five goats.  No camels  or horses, except the two  orthree near the well,  which  we captured subsequently.  A  traincame in from the  north,  and one  from the south.   That  fromthe south went on  and  contained  baggage and  women.   Thenorthern train stayed all day and the night in the station.   Atmidday we heard from  Sherif  Shakir, who was coming up withthe main  body (we  were only the reconnaissance),  that he would arrive at sunset, and we wandered  out across el-Jurf  to the lastfoothills of Dhula Abu el-Naam, till we found what seemed  tobe a good gun-position, about  2,000 yards  west of  the station.There were  no  Turkish  outposts  to  be found, except that onthe bridge.   Behind the station is a steep hill, J.  Unseih, about400 yards distant, and  we decided  to  put  400  men  into it,  totake the Turks in the rear.     The  hills about us were typical of the Eastern  Hejaz;  hills.They Avere of glistening,  sunburnt stone,  very metallic in ringwhen struck, and splitting red or green or brown as the case  maybe.  The upper part of  the hill is a cap,  of an outcrop of baserock,  and the lower  screes are  hard at  the  foot, where they  arepacked with  a  thin soil, but  loose and  sliding  on the slopes.From them sprout occasional thorn bushes,  and frequent grasses.The commonest grass sends  up a dozen blades from one root, andgrows hand- to  knee-high, of  yellow-green colours.   At  thehead  are  empty  ears, between many feathered arrows of silverydown.  With these and  a  shorter grass, ankle deep, bearing abottle-brush head of pearl-grey, the hillsides are furred white, anddance gaily in the wind.   One cannot call  it verdure, but it isexcellent  pasture, and  in the  valleys  are  great tufts of coarsegrass, waist high, bright green in colour-till it fades  to a burntyellow, and growing thickly in  all  water-lined  sand  or shingle.  .Between these tufts  are thorn  trees from eight to  forty feet inheight, and less frequently sidr trees,  giving  thick  shade, anddry sugary  fruit.    Add  some brown tamarisk, broom, a  great variety of  coarse grass  and flowers,  and  everything  that,  has   ,thorns,  and  you  exhaust the  usual  vegetation of the Hejaz.Only  on  steep  hillsides  is  there  a little   plant,   hemeid, withfleshy  green heart-shaped  leaves and a  spike  of  white  or  redblossom,  [fcs leaves  are pleasantly  acid, and  allay thirst,
     Shakir arrived at 5  p.m., but brought only  300  men,two machine guns, one  mountain  gun,  and  one  mountainhowitzer.  The lack of infantry made the scheme of taking  thestation  in rear impossible, since it would have left the gunswithout support; so we changed ideas, and decided on an artilleryaction  only.    We  sent a  dynamite party to the  north of  thestation, to cut  rails and telegraph at dawn.   I started at 8 p.m.with a company of Ateibah and a  machine-gun,  to lay  a mineand cut the  wire  between  Abu  el-Naam and   Istabl  Antar.Mohammed el-Gadhi guided us very well, and we reached the lineat 1.1.15 p.m., in a  place where there was cover for the machine-gun in a group of bushes and a sandy valley bed  about four feetdeep, 500. yards west  of the rails.   I laid a mine, and cut  thewire, and at 1 a.m. started back for the main body with a fewAgeyl, but did not get in till 5  a.m., through various accidents,and was  not able  to  go forward to the artillery position  till0.30 a.m.   I found the guns  just ready, and  we shelled  thestation till 10 a.m., when Shakir found that the Ateibah infantryhad no water, and we retired to W. Giussed without molestation.Girbis are mostly unobtainable in the eastern Hejaz, which make sit difficult for an Arab force of more than a dozen men to remainin action for half a day.     The results of the bombardment were to throw the upperstoreys of the large stone buildings into the ground-floors, whichwere reported  to contain stores and water-cisterns.  We couldnot demolish the  ground-floors.  The water-tank (metal)  waspierced and knocked out of  shape, and  three shells exploded inthe  pumping room  and brought down  much  of  the wall.   Wedemolished the well-house, over the well, burned the tents andthe  wood-pile and obtained a hit on the first waggon of the training the station.  This set it  on fire, and the flames spread to  theremaining six waggons, which must have contained inflammablestores,  since they burned furiously.   The locomotive was behind the  northern  building,  and  got steam up, and went off (reversed)Inwards Medina.   When it passed over the mine  it exploded it,under the front bogies (i.e. too late).  It was, however, derailed,and T hoped to see  the machine-gun come into action against it,but it turned out that the gunners had left their position to join usin our attack on the station, and so the seven men on the enginewere able to &quot;jack&quot; it  on the line  again in about half an hour(only the front wheels were  derailed)  and it went off towardsIstabl Antar, at foot-pace, clanking horribly.     The  north end of the station  now  surrendered, and about200 of the garrison of  the north end rushed in driblets  for  the hills (J.  Unseih) and took cover there.  I examined the prisoners(twenty-four in number, Syrians, of 130th Regt.), and also  thebrake-van  of  the  train.   The  box-body  had been  lined withmatchboard, at an interval of about four inches, and packed near the  floor with cement  (loopholed) and above with shingle, but itwas burning hotly, and the  Turks  were too close  for me toobtain  accurate details,
     We fired altogether fifty rounds (shrapnel) from 2,200 and 900 yards and  about ten belts  of machine-gun  ammunition. Deserters reported about thirty dead (I saw nine only) and forty- two wounded.  We captured the pedigree mare of Ali Nasir (the Egyptian &quot;Bab-Arab&quot; in Medina) and a couple of camels from the well-house,  and destroyed many rails.   Our  casualties were one man wounded.   Had  there been enough Arab infantry to occupy J. Unseih, which commanded the trenches at 400 yards (plunging fire), I think we  could  have  taken  the entire  garrison.   The Ateibah were not  asked  to do very much, and I do not  think would have  done  it if asked.  The Juheinah and the gunners behaved very well, and I think that the attack as an experiment  justified itself.   It had  the effect, in  the  next three days, of persuading the Turks to evacuate  every  outpost and  blockhouse on  the  line,  and concentrate the garrison in the  various  railway stations.  This action facilitated the work of the dynamite parties. Friday, March 30.     We marched back to el-Jurf,  and camped in the middle of it  from  12.30 p.m.  till  3  pan.   We then rode up the  Wadi Meseiz  (gradually turning west and south) till the watershed at 5.15  p.m.,  and  at  5.30  p.in.  had  crossed  the divide  into W. Turaa,  and  rode  clown it  till 6.30  p.m., when we  camped at  Ain  Turaa,  just  where  the  eastern Wadi  Turaa  enters the  great plain of Bir  Fueis.  The  inarch  (like all Shakir&apos;s marches) was very fast.   The water of the W. Ain is A7ery good, and fairly plentiful. Saturday, March 31.     Left el-Ain at 5.45 a.m.: rode across the plain, up the side of the wadi and over an easy pass (to the right) into Seil el-Howeita. From  this  we took the  easj7 southern   road  into  el-Muaggad, and stopped  from  S.30 a.m. till 3.45 p.m. in Wadi  Serum.   We then marched to Bir el-Ainri at 5.45 p.m. and camped there. Sunday, April 1.     liode from Bir el-Amri to camp at Abu Markha from 0 a.m. till  8.30 a.m.     Abu  Markha to Abu el-Naam  : 14 hours, 20 minutes.     Abu el-Naam  to  Abu Markha : 13 hours, 15 minutes.                II. Abu Markha to Madahrij.     After returning  from Abu el-Naam with Sherif Shakir,  Istopped  a short while with  Sidi Abdullah,  and  on Monday,April 2, marched  at  2.20  a.m. for the railway to  the north ofHadiyah.  1 took with me  Dakhilallah el-Gadhi with  40 Juheinah,and had as well Sultan el-Abbud (Ateibah), Sherif Abdullah, andSherif Agab (two sons of  Hamza  el-Feir), and Mohammed el-(iadhi.  A machine gun  with six  men and  seven  infantrymen
(Syrians) came  along  also, as  my hope  was  to  derail a trainwith  a  Garland mine,  and  then  attack  it  from a  previouslyprepared machine-gun position.   Sherif  Shakir rode  the  first half-hour with us.     We marched  down  Wadi  Ais by  the  same road as that toAbu  el-JSTaaui  to  tbe village  site  at  6.20  p.m.    Instead  of leaving  Wadi Ais at this point, we turned north with  the valley,and  camped at  7 p.ui. opposite  Magreh el-Semn, under hills onthe left bank of  the. Wadi.Tuesday, April  3.     Marched at o.20 a.m. up the wadi at 50o till 5.35 a.m., and thenswung round, towards 20o in a curve till 6 a.in., aiming direct atJ.  Shemail, a great  mass,  which  deflects the valley  westward.At 5.40 a.m. we were opposite the mouth  of  W.  Serum, and at.55 a.m. passed Bir Beclair on  our  left.   At  6 a.in.  we wereopposite the point of J. Shemail, and the wadi, which had been clear and  broad and  shingly, narrowed  down.   At  6.30 a.m.Wadi Gharid came in on the left  (it is the  quickest  way  toAbu  Markha,  but  steep),  and at  6.40 a.m.  we were oppositeBir  Bedia,  in   the  mouth of Sell  Bedia  on  the  left of  ourroad.   Seil. Bedia  rises near  Seil  Osman.   The  wadi nowwidened out  and  became  full of large ti-ees, and  more greenthan  any  wadi  !.  had seen in the Hejaz.   It has come downin  flood  twice  this  year, and   affords  splendid   pasturage.We  were now going  about 40o and at 7.15  a.m. reached  Birel-Murabba, in a broad  part of Wadi  Ais,  where it became asmall and very beautiful  plain.   We then turned 60o and marcheddown the wadi till 7.45 a.rn., when we halted opposite the mouth ofSell el-IIoweiti (from J. Serd).  At 1.15 p.m. we marched again,and at 1.45 p.m. reached  Ribiaan, the last well in Wadi Ais.  Thewell is lined with a rough stone steyning, and  is about ten feetin diameter and fifteen feet deep ;  water very  slightly  brackish.Wadi Ais at this point leaves the hills, and  enters a  great openplain, studded with low  mounds.  This plain is the common  bed(or united beds) of, amongst others, Wadi  Ais, Wadi Hamdh,W. Tubja, W. Turar, and W. Jizal (Gizal or Qizal, since the &quot; j &quot; ispronounced  ^   by  the  Juheinah  and  eastern Billi).  In  thenorth the plain  is bounded by J. Gussa, on  the Billi bank of  theHamdh.  On the west, to Wadi Ais, by J. Jasim (Kasim, Qasimor Gasim to taste ; it is a J), and south of Wadi Ais  by  J.  UrnReitba, continued in J. Tareif and J. Ajrad.   On the east it isbounded by J. JSTahar,  the  east bank of  W.  Jizal,  and then  byel-Mreikat,  J. Jindal, and  J.  [Jnseih.    On the  south it runsdown into el-Jurf and el-Magrah,  and J. Antar is clearly visiblefrom the mouth of Wadi Ais, forming the southern boundary ofthe  plain, miles away towards Medina.      We  left the direct  road  a  little, when  we mounted at.10 pan. and marched a little way north-east.  At 2.40 p.m. weleft Wadi Ais and crossed a low bank into el-Fershah, a parallel
wadi, in which were many tents of Harb and Anazeh, come bypermission into the Juheinah dira for pasture.  We camped nearthem (they refused us hospitality) at 3.20 p.m. Wednesday, April 4.     Rode at 5.30 a.m. and at 6.15 a.m. crossed the level bed of Wadi. Turaa,  and Wadi Hamdh at 6.45 a.m.  The  Hamdh was as fulloll aslam wood as at  Abu  Zereibat and had  the same  huminocky bed, with sandy blisters over it but it was only about 200 yards wide, and shallow.  We halted at 8 a.m.  in W. Tubja, which was a sort  of  wilderness garden, with a profusion of grass and shrubs  in which the camels rejoiced.  The weather was very hot, with a  burning sun that made the sandy ground impossible for me to walk on barefoot.   The Arabs have soles like asbestos, and made little complaint, except  of  the  warmth  of  the air.  There had been thunder all yesterday, and half a dozen showers of rain last night and  to-day.   J. Serd and J. Kasim were wrapped in shafts  and sheets  of a dark blue and yellow vapour that seemed motionless and solid.  We marched across W. Tubja again at 1.20 p.m.  About 1.40  p.m.  we noticed that part of the yellow cloud from J.  Serd  was  approaching us, against the wind,  raising- scores of dust-devils before its feet.   It  also produced two  dust- spouts, tight and symmetrical-stationary columns, like chimneys  one to  the right and one to the left of its advance.  .     When it got nearer, the wind, which had been scorching us from the north-east, changed suddenly, and became bitterly cold and damp, from the south-west.  It increased greatly in violence,&apos; and at the same time the sunlight disappeared and the air became thick and ochre-yellow.  About three minutes later the advancing brown  wall (I think it was about 1,500  feet high) struck us, and proved to be a blanket of dust, and large grains of sand, twisting and  turning  most  violently  with itself, and at the  same time advancing east at about forty miles an hour.  The internal whirling winds  had  the most bizarre effect.  They  tore our cloaks from us,  turned our camels  sometimes  right round, and sometimes drew them together in a vortex, and large bushes, tufts of  grass, and small trees were torn up clean by the roots,  in a dense cloud of the soil about  them, and  were driven against  us,  or dashed over  our  heads,  with  sometimes dangerous force.   We were never  blinded it  was always  possible  to see seven or eight feet each side but it  was risky to look out, since one never knew if one would meet a flying tree, or a rush of pebbles, or a column of dust.      This habub  lasted for eighteen minutes, and  then  ceased nearly as suddenly as it had come, and  while we and our clothes and camels were  all.smothered in dust and yellow from head  to foot, down burst torrents of rain, and  muddied us  to the skin.  The wind swung round to the north, and the rain drove  before  it through our cloaks, and chilled us through and through.  At .3 p.m. we had crossed the plain  and entered the bare valley of
W. Dhaiji,  which cuts through  J. Jindal at its southern end,from  the  railway  to  the Hamdh.   It  is  fairly broad at first,sandy, with precipitous rock walls.  We  rode up it till  4 p.m.and left our camels in a side valley, and climbed a hill  to see theline.   The  hill was  of  naked  rock, and with  the wet  andthe numbing cold the Ateibah servant of Sultan el-Abbud losthis nerve, pitched over a cliff, and smashed  his skull  to  pieces.It was our only casualty on the trip.   When we got to the hill-top it was too thick weather to seethe railway, so I returned to the camels,  and shivered by themfor an hour or two.   We were  stumbled upon by a mountedman,  with  whom  we  exchanged  ineffectual  shots,  and wereannoyed by  this, as surprise was essential, and we could hear thebugles of Madahrij  sounding  recall and  supper in  the  station,which was also an irritation.   However, at 9 p.m. the  explosivescame  up,  with  the rest of  the party,  and I started out withSultan, Dakhilallah and Mohammed el-Gadhi for the  line.    We had some delay in finding a  machine-gun position, forthe railway  runs everywhere near the eastern  hills of the valley,and the valley is about 3,000 yards broad.  However, eventually,we found a place opposite kilometre  1121, and I  laid a mine(trigger central, with rail-cutting charges 15 yards north and southof it respectively) with some difficulty owing to the rain, at 12 p.m.It took till  1.45 a.m.  to cover  up the  traces of  the digging, andwe left the whole bank, and the sandy plain each side,  as coveredwith huge footmarks as though a school of elephants had dancedon it, and made tracks that a blind man could have felt.  I wipedout most of  those on the embankment itself, however, by walkingup and down in shoes over it.  Such prints are  indistinguishablefrom  the daily  footmarks of the patrol inspecting the line.     We got back to the  new position at  2.30 a.m.  (still  rainingand  blowing and  very cold) and sat about on  stones till dawn,when the camels and  machine-gun came   up.  Dakhilallah, whohad been  guide and leader  all night,  now sent out patrols andsentries and outposts  in all  directions, and  went  on a hilltophimself with  glasses  to  watch the line.   The  sun  fortunatelycame  out,  so  we were able  to  get  dry and warm,  and  bymidday were  again gasping  in  the heat.  A cotton  shirt is ahandy garment, but not  adaptable  to  such sudden changes  oftemperature.Thursday, April 5.     At 6 a.m. a trolley with four men and a sergeant as a passengercame from Hadiyah (Haraimil) to Madahrij, passing over the minewithout stopping. A working party  of  sixty men came out ofMadahrij, and  began  to replace five telegraph poles  blown downnear  the  station the  day before by the habub.  At 7.30 a.m. apatrol of eleven men marched  south along the  line, two inspectingeach  rail  minutely, one walking along the bank in charge, andthen  at fifty yards interval right and left of  the line,  looking for
tracks.   At kilometre 1121 the)&apos; found abundance of the latter, andconcentrated  on the permanent way, and wandered up and downit, and scratched the ballast, and thought for a prolonged period.They then went on to near J. Sueij (Sueij,  Sueik, or Sueiq, totaste)  and exchanged greetings with the  Hadiyah patrol.  At8.30 a.m. a train  of  nine trucks, packed with  women, children and household effects came  up from Hadiyah. and  ran over the mine without exploding it, rather to our relief, since they werenot quite the prize we had been hoping for.     The Juheinah were greatly excited when the train came along.and all rushed up to  T)akhilallah&apos;s lookout,  where  we  were, tosee it.  Our  stone zariba had  been made for five only,  so thatthe hilltop became suddenly and visibly populous.  This was too much for the nerves of  Madahrij, which  called in  its  working-party, and opened a brisk  rifle fire on us, at  about  5,000 yards.Hadiyah  (or rather its outpost on a hilltop)  was encouraged bythis to take a share.  As they were about  1,200 yards off, theyretained  their  fire,  but  played selections  on  the  bugle  from.30 a.m. till 4 p.m.     This disclosure of ourselves put us in rather an unfortunateposition.   The Juheinah  and myself were on   camels, andtherefore  pretty safe, but the machine gun  was n, sledge-maxim(German)  and very heavy.   It was on  a  mule, and  the mulescould only walk.   Our position was between Madahrij (200 men)and Hadiyah  (1,100 men), with Hadiyah in Wadi Tribja, behind ourbacks.  I was afraid of their trying to cut us off in the rear, andafter consulting Dakhilallah  we rode past Madahrij  to the headof W. Um Reikham, which runs into Tubja just north of J. Jindal.and sent  the mules with an escort of fifteen Jaheinah back toWadi Ais.   Had  the Turks attacked us, the few Juheinah with me would not have been  enough to cover the retreat  of the gun :and the gunners were Meccan tailors, inexpert in handling it.     Dakhilallah,  Sultan  Mohammed and  myself then rode backto the head of Wadi Dhaije, and camped at 9.40 a.m. under somegood shady  trees, from which  we could  see the line.  this appeared  to  annoy the Turks, who shot  and trumpeted  at  usincessantly,  till about 4.30  p.in.   No  trains  passed  duringthis time I  fancy our presence held up  the traffic, for a loneengine came  down from  the  north to  Madahrij, and there wasalso heavy smoke from Hadiyah station.     At 4.30  p.in.  the Turkish  noise stopped,  aud we got on ourcamels at 5  p.m.  and  rode out slowly across the plain  towardsthe line.  Madahrij  revived  in a  paroxysm of rifle fire (4,000yards, no  damage)  and  all  the   trumpets of Hadiyah  beganagain.   Dakhilallah  was   most  pleased.   We  went  straight  tokilometre  1121, and made the camels kneel beside the line, whileDakhilallah (whose strong piety has a vein of humour) called theidhan, and led the sunset prayer between the rails.    As soon as itgot dark the Turks became quiet, and I dug  up the mine (a most
unpleasant proceeding :  laying a Garland mine is shaky  work,but scrabbling along a line for 100 yards  in  the ballast lookingPor a  trigger that is connected with two powerful charges mustbe  a  quite  uninsurable occupation), and I found  it  had sunk  sixteenth of  an  inch, probabl)T owing  to the damp ground.We replaced it, and then  fired a number of charges along therails between us and Madahrij  with great effect.  We also cut upa  good deal of telegraph  wire and  a  tmmber  of  poles, and at.30 pan. rode off down W. Dhaije again.  At 9 pan. we reachedthe Tubja-Hamdh plain, and galloped across it furiously, passingWadi  Hamdh,  W.  Turaa, W.  Abu  Marra,  and  reaching  El-Fershah and the machine-gun camp at  12.15 a.m.Friday, April 6.    Started at 6 a.m., reached  Ftubiaan at 7 a.in.,  and left it at.15 a.m.  Wadi Ais had  been down in flood since we left, andthe surface was  all  shining witli white slime  and  pools of  softgrey water.   The camels  slipped over this most amusingly, andmost of the  party went down.   Dakhilallah therefore drew us upa  mouth of Seil Howeiti, and across its delta,  and over a littlepass into the eastern bay of the plain of Murebba in  Wadi  Ais.We crossed  this, passed Seil  Badia,  and halted at 9.15 a.m. inthe mouth of  W. Gharid.   We mounted again  at 2.45 pan. androde  slowly  (everything  was  stiff  and  tired)  to  the  bendof Wadi Ais by the  ruins at 4.45 pan., where we camped for the night.  Our two messengers  who had  been  left in  Dhaije came in late, and reported that the mine (which we had heard explode;\t;ry vigorously at 7.30 a.m. this morning) had gone  off northand south of a  locomotive with rails and  about 300 soldiers.arriving from  Hadiyah to repair our damage.  The  quantityof  Turks  frightened  our men  away, so  I  cannot say if  anyinconvenience Avas caused  the  train ;  but  the break in the line was not repaired for five days, which looks as though  somethinghad delayed the enemy.Saturday, April  7.    We started at  1 aau.  and  slept the  rest  of  the  night inMarraha from 2.30 aan.  till 6 a.nr.  Then  rode  and reached AbuMarkha at 8 a,.m.    The results  of  this trip were to show me  the rare value ofDakhilallah and his son.   Their humour makes  rail way-breakinga. pleasure to them;  their authority  keeps the Juheinah in  betterorder  than ever I have seen ; and old Dakhilallah has grown greyin  successful  ghazzus, and  is as careful and astute as  any  raidercould  be.    It  also  showed  that  Garland  mines,   properly  laid,  areimpossible for the Turks to detect.   E)eA7en  men  searched for my mine for twenty minutes.  Also  that the Turkish  garrisonssuffer  badly  from   nerves  ; and that  a machine-gun  party todeal  with stranded  locomotives may require great mobility inretreat  or. advance,   and should be, if  possible,  mounted  onthe same kind of animal  as the tribal escort,         T.E.L.
                    Aden  Protectorate.                      The  Treaty Tribes.     All the subsidized chiefs are keenly  interested  in  the  great war and especially in the ultimate issue  of  the inroad of Turksto Lahej and vicinity.   None  of them  loves the  Turk  or hismethod  of  administration,  and all  wonder  at  our  inactivity.Immediately after the fall of Lahej on July 4, 1915, Idrisi wrote to his Aden agent that this  mishap was due, not to the weaknessbut to the slackness of the British.   A certain number of tribes-men have gone over to Lahej.   Of this number some  were  com-pel led by force majeure ; others were  incited by greed of booty,and some were impelled by  fear.1 .-Haushabi.     There is no doubt&quot;that, foreseeing the Turkish  inroad  fromMawia through his country, Sultan Ali Manf,  who is weaknesspersonified,  made overtures  to  Ali  Said Pasha, just  before theTurks started to move.   So far force majeure.  But  Ali  Mani&apos;went farther and was in Lahej  firing and  looting  the town till the Turks stopped him.   After the evacuation by Sultan  Sir Alibin Ahmed, Ali was styled Sultan of Lahej, but he has never beenin favour there.  He stays mainly in his own capital of el-Musemirand writes petulant letters to the Pasha, recapitulating his  goodservices  and whining  for aii  increased  stipend.   His action inLahej  was  due to his  long-cherished hatred  for  tbe house ofAbdali.  The latter had  led an  expedition into Haushabi. territoryyears before, at the instance of the Aden Residency ; for the thenruler was coquetting with the Turks.   This expedition led to theloss of certain Haushabi  lands.     The district north  of el-^an ad,  known as el-Hurrakat andcomprising  Nobat  Dukaim  and  J. Munif, formed the  subject-matter for a boundary case  before me in 1905.   I adjudicated infavour of the Abdali Sultan&apos;s right to  these  places.   The Haushabinow believes he will extend his borders at  the  Abdalfs expense.2.- Amiri.     Some time before the war  the Emir Nasr of Dala had  cometo an understanding with the  Turkish  kaimmakam of Kataba,and for many years there has been a  correspondence between the emir ShaiE  (father of Nasr) and the  Imam of Sana.   Emir  Shaifwas a crafty old fox.  He hated the  Turkish invasion and longedfor deliverance at our hands.   When  freed, however, he began to practise  petty villainies on  his tribesmen  under  pretext of con-consolidating his territories  so  long in the  occupation of the Turks,and he  resented our interfering  with schemes that involved hiscertain ruin.  So he prayed for our departure.  Emir Shaif.diedin Delhi in  1911.   His death was ascribed  to.poison administered
by me !   Emir  Nasr  is pro-Turk. pro-Imam  and anti-British.The  Emirs have sprung from a race of Muwallads or half-breeds.and no good can be expected of them.  The village of the reigningbouse (besides Dala) is Kharafa, and a jingling saw sings :      &quot;Trust not the house of Kharafa, even if it swear an oath.&quot;3. Abdali.     When the  late  Sir Ali bin Ahmed came into  Aden  as  arefugee on duly 5, 1915, there accompanied him some 1000 ofhis people.  The rest stayed behind in their  villages ; but somestill trickle into Tmad, near Sheikh Othman.   The vast majorityof Abdalis, who stayed behind, did so to safeguard their houses and property, while others remained to carry on their business ofcamel-breeding.   These  men have  been  forced, on occasion, totake up arms against us, but they do not fight  seriously.  Thereare also some Abdali  tribesmen who  have willingly joined theTurks in  the belief  that the latter will  stay and  take  over theprotection of Lahej in the end, ousting us.4. Subehi (pi. Sabbeha).     These petty marauders are the. gipsy canaille of south-westArabia.   All have joined the Turks for  booty&apos;s sake, and  thengone back to their villages.   When Ali Said  Pasha tried to levytaxes  there,  the Subebis  rebelled,  and  several small   punitivecolumns have been sent  against them from Lahej.3.- Fadli.     The  old Sultan, Husein bin Ahmed, joined  the Turks, or rather went to Lahej,  through fear that his country would beoverrun, as was Lahej.  He loathes the Turks, but owing to ourlack of activity,  he has no faith in our ability  to  protect him  ifhe were to reject the Turkish  proposals af Ali Said.   He onceasked us to land troops at Shukra.  We refused, I think wrongly.Just a demonstration was asked for to impress the Fadli tribesmen. Our refusal to comply was  translated as  our  impotence to act.     Sultan  Husein is an  old man of over 70 years,  and hascataract in both  eyes.   If  he  dies, his grandson,  Abdul Kadir.would be likely  to succeed.   But knowing the latter&apos;s pro-Britishproclivities, the Pasha has offered to  name a substitute  when thetime comes.   He has often invited  the  old Sultan to take upresidence in Lahej, where he has been given some  of the  landsof the Abdali  Sultan.   Sultan Husein distrusts the Turks andprefers to live in Shukra or to till his rich crop-land in Abyan. (i.  Yafa and Aulaki.     Sections from certain Mausata (Upper  Yafa). tribes ;  someLower Aulaki   clans,  e.g., Ba Kazim   (these befriended the Germans  who  landed  from  the  schooner)  ; some from  Upper Aulaki sections  ; some of the Radfan clansmen, and some Alawis have gone to Lahej to see what they  can pick up. but not at all drawn by any love of the Turks.
7. Behan, Beda.     Upper and  Lower Yafa, the Upper Aulaki  Suitan&apos;s domainand that of the Upper Aulaki Sheikh in fact all territories whereTurks have not come are&apos; friendly to us.   All expect us to assertourselves;  and, while the Turks are being driven back, they willpin-prick them on the line of retreat.     The Arab  proteges have always  regarded this  as a  war between  two  Daulas a  war with which they  have no  directconcern.  ,  They will, to a man, be glad to see the crumpling up of turkish  rule in the Yemen.  But I  do not know  that, they  willbe pleased  to see  us step into Turkish shoes.   The Imam Yahyasummed  up the situation from his point of view, in a letter to  the aden Residency.     &quot;My country has for years been scourged by war and devas-tation.   What we want is  peace  and to be left  alone to  repairravages.&quot;     This can only be done by the pax Britannica, whatever Arabsmay saj-.  Turkish rule or misrule once removed, the Yemenwill become the prey  of  various bellicose and  grasping rulers, andchaos will  reign  supreme.   During the present regime the Yemenhas been styled  tbe  graveyard  of  the  Turks.   There  will beconfusion  worse confounded when the Semitic  peoples  meet to try conclusions.   Our difficulties in tbe Yemen  will  start whenpeace has been declared.   Ali Said has made out draft treaties with all  our more important chiefs and asked these to  sign themwhen peace is declared;  for the whole of our Hinterland, he feelssure,  will pass over into  Turkish  hands.     He  is plotting  too  in Hadramaut, where  Seyyid abdul rahman ibn  Abeiclillah  is Ins main  agent.   His  intrigues havegiven courage to  the Kathiri Sultans, who, if once they knew wemeant to expel the Turks, would knuckle under at once to SultanSir Ghalib  of  Shihr and  Makalla.     The iman has for long been trying to extend his  spiritualsway east  and south-east and has leisure to work through  hisvarious  Makadima,  since  he is  practically neutral in the  war between  ourselves and the Turks.  All our Hinterland was onceunder Zeidi rule, and though scarcely one man in our sphere isnow a Zeidi,  there is  nothing to prevent shafa&apos;at&apos;i and Zeicli from&quot;fraternising, if advantage lay that way.  The friendly Kadi Atikof Behan,  who fled his country because of the Imams intrigues,once asked us what was  our political programme with Ibn Hamided-Din, so  that he might regulate his  conduct accordingly !  TheYemeni  Arab is  not religious,  but &quot;practises  religiositj&apos;&apos;,&quot;  asCarlyle phrased it.   Sir  Ahmed  Fad]  of Lahej was strongly pro-Imam.   The Imam Yahya&apos;s refusal to join the Turks  is largely owing to his annoyance at their capture of his  protege&apos;s capital and the  occupation of his country.H. F. J.
                       ABYSSINIA.     Colonel Pearson has returned recently  from the * ceremony of the investiture of  Ras Taffari  with the Grand Cross  of  the Order of St. Michael and St. George.   The investiture seems to have been an impressive affair and to have resulted  in so great an increase in the prestige of Ras Taffari  that an old  Fitaurari, who had hitherto refused to render to Taffari the homage which he had willingly afforded to Menelik, knelt before him and kissed his knee, expressing his recognition of the  value of the decoration as a proof of friendship on the  part of  Great Britain towards Abyssinia  and towards the Ras personally.     The Government is now  entirely occupied  with measures for dealing with Lij Yasu,  who is believed to  have  a  following of  2,000 men,  with ample stores of  grain at Magdala, whose resources are such as to enable  him to  maintain his followers there  indefinitely.   It  is  now   intended to  despatch  against Magdala a force of the nominal strength of  50,000  men,  which, however, is unlikely, in fact, to work  out  at more than  30,000. A portion of this force,  under Ras Abata and Ras Ivassa, had already left  Adis Ababa during  Colonel  Pearson&apos;s  stay, and a further contingent under Fit. Hapta Giorgis, who is  regarded as the only man capable of holding such a  force together and of overthrowing Lij  Yasu, was  expected to  leave on April  23. Ras Taffari, Ras Hailu and Bituaded Haili Giorgis were to follow a few daj^s later.     It  was calculated that the force would reach Magdala about May 10, and it  was intended to  attack simultaneously the five roads leading to the summit.  Owing to food, difficulties, it is  not possible to  maintain a  force  longer than  eight  da)7s  before Magdala ;  and if by then  the  place has not  fallen,  it  is  the intention to withdraw again, leaving  posts on  all  the five roads to watch it and  control Lij Yasu&apos;s  movements.  An escape on his part to the plains is,  perhaps,  not wholly to be deprecated, as there should be  no great difficulty in  rounding him up there.     Elsewhere,  the situation looks more promising.   The revolt in Simyen has collapsed, and Ganiazmach Ababi, who was deputed by Lij Yasu to stir up trouble there,  has  surrendered  to  Negus Waldo Giorgis.   Ras  Seyyum, of Tigre, who has been an uncertain factor, having found that his chiefs were not disposed to support him in  a refusal to obey  the Central Government,  is on  his way to meet Ras Taffari.  The people  of Wollo are reported weary of fighting and will  probably  make  no opposition  to  Government troops.   The province itself, with the districts of Worra, Hainianotand Gishe, has been given to Ras  Abata.   Abata, an  impetuousand fearless soldier, is a bitter enemy of Lij Yasu, who kept him for five )7ears in  chains in Magdala, and Taffari has probably-acted wisely in making friends  with him and in restoring him toa position of trust, as his name and influence may be invaluablelater on in any reorganisation of the  Government involving  the breaking of the power of the Council of Ministers.
     Dejaz Balcha  is reported to have been asked to take chargeof Adis Ababa, as  Ras Taffari has  ordered  the  majority of theCouncil to accompany the army, less, probably, with the idea ofutilising the troops of which they dispose, than of safeguardinghimself against intrigue during his absence from the capital.                          LIBYA.            The  Agreements with Mohammed Idris.     The policy adopted by the British and Italian Governmentsof supporting  Seyyicl Mohammed Idris in  his  efforts  to  make good his  hereditary claim to the headship  of  the  Senussi secthas resulted  in the conclusion  of agreements between  him andthe two Governments.  These agreements provide, on the  Senussi&apos;part, for the  preservation of  peace, the  surrender&apos; of all personswho may  be compelled to land on the coast of Cyrenaica at placesnot in effective occupation of the Italians ; the surrender or expul-sion from Africa of all enemy officers or agents; and the removalof all persons-who  may try to make trouble between Seyyid Idrisand  either of the two Governments.   In return, Great Britain andItaly have consented  to allow a certain amount of trade with theArabs at the  ports  of  Sollum, Tobruk, Derna,  and  Bengazi.Jaghbub remains within Egyptian territory, but its administration will  be entrusted to Seyyid Idris, so  that  it  practically  remains in the same position as before the war.     The  amount of  trade, especially in foodstuffs, that can  be-permitted at  Sollum, arid also the freedom  of  entry of WesternArabs  into  Egypt  are,  of  course,  much   restricted, by  theconditions produced  by the war.  It  is,  of  course, undesirable that the Arabs should be  allowed to accumulate reserve-stocks offood ; but it is probable that some time must  elapse before theItalians will  be  in a position  to supply  them with  even  theamount of  food that  might safely  be permitted  to  enter  thecountry.  The inevitable  delay  will  not, however, cause as  muchsuffering as might  have been expected, since  the barley crop has just been  harvested  and  is believed  to  have been,  up to  theaverage in most parts of the country.     The  stability  of  these  agreements  depends  on   whetherSeyyid  Idris  is able to establish his authority over the  Senussia,or not.   It is believed that he is sincerely desirous of maintaininggood relations with the British Government and with Egypt, andof putting an  end  to the war  with  Italy,  which  has  lasted solong.  It is probable that, in order  to avoid  hostilities with theItalians and  the renewal of the  blockade,  he will make  any concession which does - not compromise  his  authority  over theArabs.  At the same time, it must be remembered that, thoughSeyyid  Ahmed is not likely to oppose  Seyyid Idris openly, it is
Ear from probable that he will resign leadership willingly, or thathe will wholeheartedly acquiesce in a pacific policy.   If  he getsthe chance of persuading the  Arabs  that Idris has mismanagedaffairs and has made too great concessions to England or to Italy,he will almost certainly  use it as a  weapon for the  purpose  ofousting Seyyid Idris  and regaining his  former power.   At this moment Seyyid Idris&apos;s chances of success appear to be very good.He left  the  vicinity of  Tobruk  about  April  18  with  theintention&apos; of  marching  via  Jedabia. to  Jalu to meet  SeyyidAhmed, who  was last reported to  be  in  that neighbourhood.His first move will no doubt be to detach from Seyyid  Ahmedthose of his  followers who still adhere  to him.   When he has reduced his cousin to impotence, he may succeed in prevailing on him to retire to Kufra, where he can do little harm.     It appears  as  if   Idris  has  definitely   broken  with  theTurkish Government and its emissaries in Northern Africa ; butit is probable  that he will accept from them any arms or moneythat they may send him  in the hope of gaining him to their side.He cannot  be expected to  hand  over  the Turkish  officers  asprisoners of  war, but  he has undertaken  to  expel them  fromAfrica if they fall into his hands.   Seyyid Ahmed, on the  otherhand,  is  very much  under  Turkish influence, and there is  apossibility of  his joining Nuri, Suleiman Baruni, and RamadanShitewi, AVIIO are believed to be threatening- Sirt and endeavouringto stir up the Arabs in Cyrenaica against the Italians.     As soon  as  the Great War is  over, it is possible that  theItalian Government will  press Idris to carry into effect some  ofthe conditions of the agreements,  the  execution  of  which  hasbeen deferred till circumstances are  favourable.  The extent  towhich  he will be able to  meet their views will probably  dependon the security of his position amongst the Arabs.   He could  atany moment make himself supreme amongst them  by adopting afanatical policy and proclaiming a.  holy  war against  Italy  ; but,before he can make concessions  for  the  purpose of maintainingpeace and trade, he must be quite certain that  he has  a sufficientgrip of the  Arabs to ensure their acquiescence.     The  successful termination of the  peace  negotiations withMohammed Idris is generally known by the  western  Bedouins.and  the effect on them will probably  be good.  They  have suffered considerably by  the feeling of unrest and the possibilityof further hostilities, and can  now settle down  to  their formeravocations.  While, in the past, no great love was lost betweenthe Aulad Ali and the Arabs lying further west, there  was alwaysa  considerable movement  along  the  coastal  zone, and  on  the inland trade routes.   This has only  been carried on  during  thelast nineteen  months, at the  risk  of spoliation by   the Turco-Senussi force, or  of arrest by the British.     On the whole, the Egyptian Bedouin  has  less  to  gain by there-establishment  of peace than  his western  neighbour, as he hasnot been  so  reduced  by  starvation ;  but a  great part of  the
barley crop oE tbe coastal area used to find its way westwards, aswell as the  Siwa date crop,  and  with settled  conditions theBedouins have hope  that trade may be resumed.  It is as yetearly to judge what the position of Mohammed Idris will be withour Bedouins.  Amongst the more enlightened, he is regarded asa, man of stronger character  and wider outlook than his cousinAhmed, for he saw far enough ahead to realize  the futility, froma Senussi point of view, of  an  attack  on  Egypt, and  thus hasavoided the odium which Seyyid Ahmed incurred by his failure.On the other hand,  Senussism has ceased to exist  in Egypt asanything but a  religious  confraternity ; the zaurias have been demolished,  and the  mosques  closed.   These  will  only  bere-opened,  when the  time  comes, under orthodox  preachers, sothat, in the . eyes of the militant Senussist of  two years ago,Mohammed Idris will be the bead of a confraternity of much diminished importance in  Egypt, whatever the position maybebeyond our western  frontier.   Memories are  not longer in theEast than in the West, and one may expect in  the not distantfuture  to hear Seyyid Ahmed extolled  as a great man  who wassold by his treacherous allies ; while  Mohammed Idris will bedecried as a friend of the Christian,  whose  accession  to powersynchronized with the collapse of Senussism in Egypt.                          NOTES.Euphrates  Tribes.    Baghdad reports that the hostile tribesmen,  who  have beenannoying  us  on the  left bank  from Fellujah southwards toMuseiyib (just north of Kerbela), have now been, brought to bookby punitive measures.  Their country has been patrolled by  con-verging columns starting from the two extreme points, and severepunishments have been inflicted.   The leading sheikhs are  nowcoining in,  and terms will be imposed upon them.    The Duleim, who, as Baghdad remarks  (under date May 7),must remain under  Turkish influence so long as the enemy H.Q.are at  Ramaclieh, are  still hostile;  but  the Amarat, of  FahadHadhdhaFs following, show a  disposition to break with  AjeimiSaadun and come in with us.  Fahad is still some  distance fromKerbela.  We are trying to get the Nejef people to hold  up orrefuse, access to Ibn. Rashid&apos;s food caravans,  which usually cometo the  Euphratean markets at  this  season ; but  our hold  is notyet strong  enough between Nejef and Samawah to ensure success.One of these caravans, of 5,000 camels, was  reported  at A in o-Seyyid, five hours from Nejef, when Baghdad sent us this infer-mation.Kuweit News.    Our Political  Agent at Kuweit sends  the following, underdate February 19.
    &quot; Sheikh Salim is very busy introducing reforms.  One of his first acts was to send for the Jews and forbid them  henceforth todistil liquor in Kuweit.   The amount of drinking that had been going on in the place was becoming a  scandal.   I  had occasion to speak of it several times to the late  Sheikh and  once publicly.in his Mejlis in the market-place.  Nothing was  done,  however,till Salim took the matter up.   He is inclined to puritanism, andsti*ong liquor is anathema to him.  The Sheikh  is  also dividing the city into  Mahallas  or  quarters, each under a Mukhtar  orguardian, who will  be responsible for maintaining order  in hisquarter and for bringing all delinquencies to notice.  Particularly,he will be expected to keep  an  eye  on all  strangers  and  report their goings-on, if suspicious.   Export-dues, fish  and house taxeshave been abolished, and all imports  are now  to  pay a uniformad valorem duty of 4 per cent.   These and other  reforms havebeen separately reported.  They are  viewed with favour  by thepeople generally ; but, no doubt, those whose bad habits or private interests are affected, will  seek means  of subverting the new regime sooner or  later.   Detraction of the Sheikh  will probablybe their chief weapon.  The Customs-Master  and  Mullah Salih,who are said to have feathered  their  nests rather too luxuriously,are being carefully watched, and one Abdul Aziz bin Salirn hasbeen appointed Mufatish, or superintendent over  them.    The Sheikh appears to be  genuinely  anxious to  put  a stopto the illicit trade with  Hail and Medina; but in this  he will haveenormous difficulties to contend with.   The other day he  sent forthe principal merchants, showed them a  letter from me  on thesubject, and threatened them with dire penalties if they continued their blockade-running  ventures.  He  warned them he would notpunish  them in the mild frankish way (i.e. by fine  and imprison-ment),  but would cut off the tongue of any offender he  caught.It is to  be  hoped that this threat  will have an effect;  but the enormous profits  of the traffic have so far proved  too  great  atemptation for even the best among them.&quot;Ilejaz Mission to Abyssinia.     Sayyicl Abbas Melki, who had been sent by  the King of the hejaz to promote his  cause among the Abj^ssinian  and  SomaliMoslems, and counteract the formerly  active Turkish  propaganda,has now returned home after a most successful journey.     As has already been said,  he started off  badty,  scandalizinglocal opinion by inveighing against  the Ottoman Sultan&apos;s person.This  having been put right, all went  well.  He travelled fromAdis  Abeba with the British Somaliland  Commissioner throughHarar and Hargeisa to Berbera,  and had  a gratifying reception,especially in the last two places, where he  was feted by  all the moslem community.   His journey,  therefore, cannot have failedto have good results.
Syrian Railways.     From  a good  source we have  received recent information about the actual conditions  on Syrian railways.   It  is reportedthat on the Aleppo-Rayak line only one  to two trains run  daily,there being a shortage of locomotives.  If those diverted to the bagadad railway were returned, an average  of  three  and a halftrains each way could be maintained daily, so long as Germanycontinues to supply spare parts.  Ten engines are  actually work-ing and six are under repair.   The capacity of the narrow-gaugeRayak-Damascus line  is so inferior that only ammunition andother heavy gear is sent by it,  troops doing the distance  on foot.Some fourteen  engines are running on the whole Beirut-Damascusline and eight are under repair.   On the Damascus-Deraa section,owing to engine shortage, there are seldom four trains a clay eachway.   The engines lent to the Bir Saba and Medina sections suffermuch from sand and the incapacity of the drivers; and an unusualnumber are always in the repair-shops.   All rolling stock is in abad state.  The old personnel of  the French Railway Company is working at the Rayak. shops,  and Hungarians are employed  atDamascum (Kadem) and Jerusalem.     Under date April  26, Captain Lawrence sends the followingnotes on  miscellaneous  topics.   The)&apos;   were  collected  by  himduring his sojourn with Abdullah in Wadi Ais : Antecedents of the  ld.ej.az Revolt.     Talaat, in 1913, showed great anxiety about the situation inthe  Hejaz.   its subjugation  and  the  imposition of  militaryservice there had been a favourite  project.   Mali mud  Shevketand the Turkish Ministry generally  looked upon the situation asdisquieting, on account  of  the  great hold  Husein  Pasha wasgetting  on the people.  This  was  tbe  real reason  of  Wahib&apos;appointment,  and  his withdrawal was  a, personal triumph forFeisal, who secured from  Talaat a promise that Wahib would be ried  by  court-martial for infringing the  privileges of the Hejaz.     Sherif  Abdullah was regarded as  the probable cause  of trouble in  the  Hejaz, and to keep him out of  it he was offeredfirst the  Wakf Ministry and  then  the Vilayet of Yemen.   he saw the idea, and refused the appointments.  Abdullah has a lowopinion of Talaat&apos;s judgment, and  regards  him  as  brutal andignorant.     The   previous plan  of  Sherif  Abdullah  to  secure  theindependence  of Hejaz  (as  a preliminary  to  the formation  ofan  Arab State) was  to  lay  sudden hands  on the  pilgrims atMecca during the  great  feast.   He calculated that the foreign government  concerned (England,  France, Italy, and Holland)would bring pressure on the Porte to secure their release.   Whenthe Porte&apos;s efforts  had failed, these Governments would have hadto approach the Sherif direct, and would have found him anxious
to do all in his  power to meet  their wishes, in-exchange for  a promise of immunity from  Turke)7  in the future.  This action had been  fixed  (provisionally)  for  1915,  but  was  quashed bythe war.Hejaz  Tribes.     Abdullah gave  the  eastern  Ateibah  (he has little  controlover them,  and they  would probably not have come  to Heja/,to  fight for him,  had  he  asked  them)  orders to  help  ibn saud against Ibn Rashid.  It was partly on account of this that   *Ibn Rashid  declared war on the Sherif.  Abdullah doesn&apos;t reallycare at all if they help Ibn  Saud or not; but  the order was an assumption  of control over all the Ateibah (which  Abdullahpretends to) in  a form  to which Ibn Saud  could hardly objectwith grace.     The Turks gave decorations (mentioned in  &quot;Arab Bulletin,&quot;No.  44)  to  Aida, Towala,  and  Fagir  (Fuqara)  Sheikhs.  the recipients decided to show their new orders  to  Sidi Abdullah,but, as they were crossing the line near Toweira, they ran into a turkish  patrol, and the  camel  carrying their  personal baggagewas killed  and had to  be  abandoned.   The Turks  have thusreceived back their insignia.     The  Ateibah believe  that  Christians wear  hats so that theprojecting  brims  may  intervene between  their  eyes and  theuncongenial sight of God.     Dakhilallah el-Gadhi, who has had good  means of judging,regards the Billi as less than half the strength  of the Juheinah,and a  little  less than  the tribes under Ferhan  el-Aida.  Ferhan(who  is with Abdullah) is the son of Motlog  Allayda, Doughty&apos;sOld  host.   Dakhilallah says that Billi and  Huweitat  are muchfiercer fighters than Wuld  Ali or  Ateibah.   Indeed.  I notice-a contempt for the Ateibah among  the Juheinah, and think that there  is a good  deal of justification for the feeling.

ARABIA.                           Hejaz.                         Intelligence.     The situation remains much the same, pending the develop- ment of more organized and extensive operations  against  the railway by Sherif Abdullah in the  Hadiyah  section, and Sherif Feisal in the Ala section.   Meanwhile  desultory raiding&apos; as far north as Disad is maintained, and the Turks have had  to  bring more men into the Moadhdham district.   Now that the)&apos;  have so many troops in South Palestine, they may  spare a  battalion or two to reinforce the  railway guards  ; but supply difficulties must limit such  reinforcements.   Abdullah&apos;s  men  have had  a successful raid at Toweira, and taken nine Turks.     Bir el-Mashi is still unshaken.   The Turks, so long as they hold  this point and  also Manjur on the  Barb  es-Suitani, are secured against a surprise attack on Medina from south or  west : and, commanding the railway also, can afford to leave Medina itself denuded of troops.   It appears  that,  in addition to the 12nd and  .55th  Regiments,  they  still  keep the  130th south of. Medina.     News has come from Feisal that  Abdullah  has received a deputation  of eighteen  Abdah   Shammar  sheikhs,   bringing excuses  and  a  letter from  Ibn Ajil.   They stated that Ibn Rashid had deceived  them with assertions  that the  British had invaded  Hejaz :  now  that they know the Sherif is supreme and only helped by us, they  will not fire  another shot  at  his  men. There is  no sign of  Ibn Rashid  himself  having come down to the  Medina  neighbourhood, nor of his patrols  which, it was reported, were to take over the guard of the southern section  of the railway)-.  He has, no doubt, kept at  home to watch Ibn Saud in Qasim and Nawwaf Shaalan in  Jauf (though  lie is said, on good authority, to have an agreement with  the latter).   Feisal himself has had  letters &quot;from  Fahad  ibn Hadhdhal  (see also p. 246)  and Mohammed ibn Mijlad,  the  two paramount chiefs of the Amarat, who  say they only wait for him to come their  wayto join forces (later information from  Wejh implies  that oneof the Mijlad family,  if  not Mohammed himself, brought  these letters).  That he has had a similar letter from Ajeimi Saadunis also reported.    Feisal left Wejh for Jeddah on May 17  in the ship convey-ing Sir Mark Sykes and Monsieur  Picot to  meet King  Huseinon May 19.  He proposes to return by the  first opportunity,  to push  his offensive against the railway.   The meeting with theKing  duly took  place,  and the  Commissioners  proceeded  to
                 Wejh to Wadi Ais and back.         I.  Wejh to Wadi Ais via the Darb el-Gar a.     I left Wejh at 9 pan. on March 10, with four Ageyl and. fourEifaa Juheinah, for Sidi Abdullah&apos;s camp.  We went out along theKhauthla road as far as J. Jidra (el-Nebaclein ; but the  northernhill of the  two), at 12.30 a.m.   We then, bore off right  from theKhauthla road,  across  a  sanded area  of  rough  stones.  Thislasted only till 12.50 a.m., when we entered a wadi, crossed it, and passed over others and their tributaries till 1.15 a.m.,  when  westopped in  Seil Arja, which runs down to Munaibura.   The goingfor the last hour w7as rough.                               .March 11.     Started at 6 a.m. up a tributary of Seil Arja, and continued init till 6.30 a.m., when we reached the head of the valley and entereda plain, about a mile wide.  At 6.45 a.m. the road forked and wewent right downhill, at 140o,i.nto Seil Mismah, at 7.10 a.m. Mismahruns into Arja and Munaibura.   We crossed it and rode up a side-valley (rough in parts)  to a watershed at 7.40 a.m.,  and a steepdescent of a few minutes into a great sand and gravel plain.  Acrossthis we went at 1100 till 8.15 a.m., when we crossed Wacli el-Murra.which runs into the Sebakha at Kurna ; J. Murra was about three miles away to the north.  At  10:10 a.m. we reached Wacli AbuAjaj, running from 20o to 200o; it  is not one bed, but a whole system of sells, all shallow and bushy,  with soft sandy  water-courses  winding about them.  About three  miles away on theright lay J. Ajwi, overlooking Mersa Zaam.  Ajwi is a very un-mistakable  square-sided flat-topped  coral reef.  We stopped  at10.45 a.m.  in Wadi Abu Ajaj and  started again at  12.45 p.in.At  1.30 p.m. I was abreast of J. Tibgila,  about five miles off, andat  1.50.p.m. and 2.5 pan. crossed the branches of Wadi Ghorban,which passes just south of Tibgila.   The going across  the plainwas at first soft, and later rather more  solid, but with  very  softsandy valleys,  which would be bad for cars.  The guide now tookus too far east, and the path entered the  lower spurs  of J. Raal,so  that we  did not enter the Hamdh valley till 4 pan...   We boreacross this  to the  ghadir at Abu Zereibat,  which  we reached  at p.m.  It was little, if any, smaller than it had been in Januarylast.March 12.   -Started at 3.45 a.m. and proceeded to lose the  road in thedark.  At 4.30 a.m. we entered low rough  hills, J. Agumma,till  5.20 a.m., when we turned to the right up  Seil Aguna at 1350.At 5.30 a.m. reached the watershed, which was easy,  and rodedown a short valley on luxuriant  colocynth into el-Khubt,  at.10. a.ni.  Colocvnth makes the best timber  when crushed  and
dried.   Its juice is rubbed on the feet to produce a purgative effect,which is said to be quite distinct, even when the drug is applied in this very diluted manner.   Horses which will eat its stalks andleaves can go without water for a considerable time.     El-Khubt is a great plain, draining  at its extremity intoWadi Hamdh near Abu Zereibat.   A road goes up it to Um Lejj.We crossed  it diagonally, aiming for el-Sukhur (wrongly, calledJ. Arban on the map).  At 7.15 a.m. Ave reached the east bank of el-Ivhubt, and turned right, up a side-valley, for ten minutes, onto the plain (Magrah) of el-Darraj, a scrub-covered area leadingright up to  the feet of  el-Sukhur.   We halted, at 7.40 a.m. inthe middle of a rain shower, which Listed  intermittently from  6till 8.30 a.m.  In el-Darraj Avere some half-dozen tents of  WaishBilli, with sheep, goats, horses and camels.  There  has been norain to speak of in the Bluwiya this year, and plenty in theJ uheiniya, and, therefore, many of the Billi have come over the border  rjeaceably to pasture.   These tents Avere watering fromHeiran.     We left el-Darraj halt at 10 a,m. and moved across to the feet of the Sukhur.  We Avound up a valley till we Avere between themand the isolated Sakhara south-west of them, and then scrambledfor fifteen minutes up rock shelves  and along faults OA&apos;er a kniferidge and down a stony bed, past a huge  boulder all hammeredover with  tribal  marks, into the basin of Wadi Heiran.   TheSukhur are  huge striated masses of a reddish  coloured volcanicrock, grey on the surface ; the  Sakhara  is like a brown water-melon standing on end :  on its south and east faces it is absolutely&apos;smooth, and dome-headed,  polished till it shines, with  fine  cracksrunning up  and across it, like seams.   The height above the plainmust be about 700 feet.     At 1.1.5 a.m. we were over  this pass and in a narrow valley,between granite outcrops.  This led into  another valley, and soto another, till we entered  Wacli Heiran (40o to 200o, its course)at noon.  The well lay some way on our right,  doAvn the valley.We crossed  the valley, rode up  a tributary, and then till  12.45p.m. went up and  doAvn  over  granite shards  piled  up in tiny50-foot  mounds all round us in wild  confusion.  There was noroad and we kept no direction,  but wandered  where  Ave  could.Wadis ran in and out everywhere.     At 12.45 p.m.  we descended  sharply into Seil  Dhrufi,  awooded valley 100  yards wide, along which we went at  1200.At 1.30 p.m. we got to the head of our branch of the valley, andascended a  narrow and  difficult hill-path, with broken steps &quot;ofrock, difficult for camels, round  a shoulder  of Jebel Dhrufi  (it isa range) to  a saddle  from which a steep but short descent led into and across a A&apos;alley sweeping doAvn  from north-east towards thesea.  The ground again became  a confusion of small mounds andvalleys till a neAV watershed was reached at 1.40 p..m.   This waseasy and led us  to  a big valley running south ; we bent on the
left at right angles close by the rock-wall down which  we had come.   We turned up this gorge, which grew very narrow, andthe path  soon left the  bed and  began to climb the  side of the hill to the north.   The  ascent was  very  steep,  unfit for ladencamels, owing to  the rough  surface and the narrowness  of  the path, between very sharp slopes above and below.   At 2.20 p.m.we reached the watershed and descended a  sandy valley into. Hanbal,  a large well-wooded tributary  of W.  Heiran.   Westopped for twenty minutes to gather for the camels the luxuriantgrass in a little  sandy bay  of the  hills  and  then crossed  thewadi and  marched up  a tributary of its  east bank,  W. Kitan.This is a stony valley with a good hard surface (no rocks), about300  yards wide from  hill to  hill, and well wooded with  thorntrees.  We marched  up  till 4.15 p.m. and then halted ;  thevalley  had drawn in a little in  the last half-hour.  The hills onthe south were small;  but to the  north is  a very  large hill,.1. Jidwa, about six miles long and  perhaps three  miles distant,flanking the  valley with a steep  and high  hog&apos;s back, runningnearly north and south.March 13.     Started at 3.30 a.m. and reached the  head of  W. Kitan in  afew minutes  and went over a narrow pass between rock masses(steep  but not difficult;  too  narrow for wheels) into Seil Jidha.which runs into W. Amk.  It has sharp hills each side.   At 4.30a.m. we diverged to the right up a gorge  running south.  Thiswas from eight to ten feet wide between its cliffs, but the bed of thetorrent was all encumbered with fallen stones  and trees, so thatthe passage was difficult.   At 4.50 a.m. we reached its head and found  a gentle valley running away south.  At 4.50 a.m.,  whenthe Wadi  turned  west about a mile  above Bir Reimi,  which isonly the mall  in the wadi bed.   The water  smelt one  foul smell.and tasted equally unpleasantly but quite differently.  We hadhigh hills on the east and smaller hills to  the west.   We startedagain at 8.30 a.m., leaving Wadi Reimi  by a side wadi to thesouth,  which ascended to a gentle watershed, from which we hada fine view clown the broad and green  Wadi Amk,  which passesthrough  Khuff to the sea.  This branch of it runs 150o and isbounded by considerable hills.  At 9.10 a.m. the  valley turnedmore to the east, and at 9.20 a.m. received a large feeder (on  themain stream) from the north, and bore off 180o.  We cut acrossthe confluence, at  70o, making for the centre of  a great hill in front of us.  At 9.30 a.m. we  found a side valley and  at 9.40a.m. went&quot; over a patch of soft white sand in its bed.  At 10.15a.m. we entered Wadi Dhuhub  el-Amk, coming from  the  northto join W. Amk.   We went up a side valley from it, with highhills on the right about a quarter of a  mile off, and then climbeda  sandy valley between  piles of  the curiously  warped greygranite, looking like cold toffee, that one finds frequently in the hejaz.  This vallej&apos; led us to the foot  of one of these great stonepiles, up which runs a natural ramp and staircase, badly broken,
twisting and difficult for camels, but short.   This brought us at10.30 a.m. back into W. Dhuhub again, above its northern bend.We, followed the valley till 11.38 a.m. (its head).   It runs aboutT209, has low hills  on the right, and high hills on the left of theroad, and is full  of quite large trees ; there are water pools in thegorges about it.   There were a number of Merawin tents here andthere, with plentiful sheep and goats.   At 11.15  a.m. the valleynarrowed and began (from being excellent smooth shingle) to getstony.  At 11.25 a.m. it became a mere ravine, on the north bank ofwhich an execrable track led us  up to the watershed between W.Dhuhub el-Amk and W. Marrakh.  The view from the crest wasbeautiful, but the descent  dangerous.   We reached the foot at.11.45 a.ni.. and.  found ourselves  in an absolutely  straight valley.running steeply  downhill  at ISO0 towards a depression  ahead.between two regular walls  of modei-ate hills.   At 12.25  p.m. alarge side-valley entered on the right, showing, through its breakin the hills, a parallel range a couple of miles away and  brokenground behind.   There was  a corresponding  (but small) breakon the left.  The hill, walls then opened out in.  a double  sweeplike an amphitheatre of: grey stone with veins of dark red  browngranite  running over  them in up-and-down lines, looking  likecockscombs, or a rustic scenic railway ;  and in front came clowna steep black wall of harm, with a low hill of brown granite inthe middle of the line.   We halted at 1.10  p.m.  under the trees,shortly  after passing a pile-circle of uncut stones  about forty feetin diameter, with a central cairn, and some small square piles roundabout it, outside the circle.   These were the first stone remains Ihad noted (bar simple cairns) on the way from Wejh, but from now onwards to the mouth of Wadi  Ais  they  were to growincreasingly frequent.   In parts  of the harra and its valleys  aredistinct remains of  old villages and rough  terrace constructionsfor cultivation.  The Juheinah ascribe all these to the Beni Hillahand never put up even  a cairn of more than three or four  stonesthemselves.  Their only stone constructions are little square box-houses  of the  type  they  call  &quot; nawamis&quot; in  parts of  Sinai.These little places are made to shelter the young lambs and kids.and are put up, as needed, by the  shepherd boys.     We have now got  into a, much more fertile area than  theTihamah  or the hills near Wejh.  My camel men got milk to-day in the Merawi tents the first milk they had tasted for two years and this plain of fine quartz  gravel and coarse sand is all studdedover with a stubbly grass, in tufts sixteen inches high, of  a  slategreen colour, white at the tips.  The heat is very great, but thereis a faint cool wind, which, however, has little effect on the plague,of flies.,         i     I have with me a Syrian, a Moroccan, a Merawi. four Rifaa,and three men from Aneizah, Rass, and Zilfi respectively.   The lastdescribes himself as an eyewitness of Shakespear&apos;s death.   He sayshe was with Ibn Saud&apos;s artillery, looking through his field glassesand very conspicuous, since he was wearing full  British uniform
and a sun-helmet over all.  He was therefore easity picked out, andwas shot at long range.  His helmet was taken into Medina, andpublicl)? exhibited as proof to all Moslems that  Ibn Saud  was atraitor to Islam, and had permitted Christians into  his country.There were great demonstrations in Medina, and the hat is stilldisplayed in the  Serai, with an inscription pointing its moral.     We started again  at 2.35 p.m.  (120o)  across Wadi Marrakh,which runs out to westward to the Makassar just south of HarratGelib, and at 3 p.m. entered Harrat Gara.   It fills a wadi, running-north, and falls down  in steps or waves to Wadi Marukh,  whereit is cut short.   We had mounted its  first  terrace by  3.25  p.m.,and found a small sand and grass plain in the lava of the secondstep.  We then turned east, up Wadi  Gara, which  is one of themain sources of the lava flow.  The  lava was  in a great  rope,down the centre of the valley, whose  water had  cut  for itself adeep bed in the granite each side.  At 4  p.m. a stream of lavacame in from the south, and we crossed it, and  the  edge of themain stream, and other side streams,  very slowly and painfullytill 4.50 p.m.  The  north bank of the  wadi was a straight line ofhills.  At 4.50 p.m. we ] assed a first crater, of  fine sifted  blackash and earth, just south of the road, and at 5.10 p.m. halted atthe tent of Sheikh Fahad el-Hamshah, who produced bowl afterbowl of milk, till 10 p.m., and then rice and a dismembered sheep.Camels and men all  very tired, for the going  over  the harra isvile.  Harra looks like  scrambled eggs that have gone very wrong,and affords the worst going imaginable for man or beast.March 14.     Started at  5.40  a.m. and at 6.25 turned 120o with the valley,and then sharply to the  left up  the  slope between a group ofcones of black ash from a huge crater to the south.   At 7.10 a.m.reached the watershed  (Has Gara)  and went down the easternslope of the valley, passing the remains of what was  perhaps afort, of rough uncut stones, rectangular, about 40 feet wide and100  feet long.  Walls about three feet thick,  and now not  morethan four feet high.  Descent was very bad ; at 8 a.m. left the mainvalley and stopped at 8.20 a.m., at the end of the harra, up a side-valley, in the tents o  Sheikh Mualeh,  a relative  of  Fahad.  Wehalted till 9.35 a.m. and then marched 120otill 10 a.m. when we reached the head of the valk^y, across remains of old settlement andfields. At 10.10 a.m. we had crossed a small spur into a tiny vallej&apos;between hills, which led us at once to a  kind of chimnej-,  upAvhich the camels had to climb till 10.25 a.m.   It was dangerousriding up,  and  most of us walked.  From the top there was an easy run down Wadi Shweita till 11.20 a.m., when it ran.intoWadi Murramiya, one  of the most important tributaries from theJuheiriiya into Wacli Hamdh.&apos; The wadi  is  filled all across themiddle with  bristling  harra,  but a  clear path  exists each side.We marched along the west edge till  11.50 a.m., when we  struckround a bay of lava, and camped under a  tree in a grassy dell.
 In the hollows and sandy places of the harra you find wonderful vegetation, which affords the best grazing in the country.  Flowers grow freely, and the grass is really green  and juicy.   The green looks the more wonderful in comparison with the blue-black naked crusts and twists of jagged rock all around.  Harra seems to be either loose piles of  fist-  or head-sized stones, rubbed together and  rounded,  possible for camels ; or solid, almost crystallized, fronds of rock, which are impossible to cross.     We mounted  again at 2.15 pan. and crossed the  remaining harra in a few minutes to a fiat  plain, containing stone circles and  cairns.  At 2.40  p.m. this came to its  end, and we  turned 1250 up  an easy pass.  At 3 p.m. reached the watershed  (broad and  flat) and  entered Wadi Cheft, which  is half a mile wide, straight, overgrown with brushwood and  lined with  hills.  At its lower end  (3.45  pan.)  was a field  about a quarter of a mile square, ploughed two years ago.   This was the first field I had seen in the Juheiniya, though many others are reported.  The field ended in &amp; harra which we crossed the worst road, yet experienced on the march.   We have had many bad roads, but this is awful. The  path zigzagged across the harra, which is very deep and piled up and broken.   At 4.30 p.m. we reached the southern side (it was  going north) and climbed a  low watershed into  a smooth valley, which turned down towards W. Murramiya, at 4.40 p.ra. We climbed a  feeder for a few minutes, and then rode down into W. Murramiya.   Its central harra was easy to cross, and took  five minutes only, and we then climbed up its further bank it is here a plain about two miles wide, covered with large trees (W. Gbadirat Murramiya) till  near the  eastern hill  border.  Along this  we marched, by a beautiful road, till  dark.  We could see the lava a mile and a half to our right, and behind it a break in the hills  and high ranges in the  distance.  At 6 p.m. it  got  dark and a  hill&apos; rose  up in the centre of the valley.  About  6.30 pan. we crossedan imperceptible watershed,  and  rode  down  W.  Tleib, till we stopped at 7 p.m. March 15.     Rode at 5.30 a.m. down the valley, which became moreand moregreen as it got lower.   Thehillseach sidewerelowat first, but thenJ. Elif on the  right, and  later J. Keshra on the left, raised  thelevel.  At 8 a.m. we passed a conical hill in the valley, belowKeshra, and at 8.30 aan. went over a low watershed into a parallelvalley ; at 9.20 a.m. this opened  into W. Ais at  Abu Markha,where the valley is  about a mile  wide, more thickly wooded thanmost Hejaz valleys, and with a great 30-foot deep water hole toan underground stream  in its side.   Wadi  Ais is here sharplylimited by hills on its south side, but is open on its  north; withall the Tleib S3&apos;stem of  valleys running down into it.  I found Sidi  Abdullah  at Abu Markha, just dismounting from his camel,after his  march here from Bir el-Amri,
     Time taken from Wejh to Wadi Ais : 47 hours.     Road was a. bye-road, impossible for  any but  pack-animalsand not for regular or extended use by them.     Average speed  of camels about three miles per  hour.                  II. Abu Markka to Wejh.     When Sidi  Abdullah  had made arrangements  for a nightlycutting of  the railway, 1  decided that T might return to Wejh.I started, therefore at 6 a.m.,  with three Ageyl, and Mohammedel-Gad hi, with, about a dozen  of  his  followers.  Sherif  Shakirput us on our way for the first half-hour.     At  7  a.m. we reached tbe  low  watershed  into  W. Tleib.which we  had  crossed on  the journey down to Wadi  Ais.  Weinarched across Wadi  Tleib, and up  a steep side-valley to thenorth  of Jebel Keshra.   At  8.55 a.m. we  reached tbe  head  ofthis, and  went down an  easy  slope into  W. Saura, turning alittle right  out of our road to some tents at 9.20  a.m., where wehalted.   They fed us very hospitably, and at 12.50  p.m.  we rode;across Wacli Saura, which comes from the east, and up a northernbranch  of  it to the common  origin  of W. Osinan  and WadiBeclia, on  the  eastern slope of J. Riam, at 2.5 p.m.  On thewestern slope of  Riam is  the common source of W.  Tleib andW. Murramiya.  We rode down W. Osman (which is fit for gun-wheels, except for   about 150 yards  at  its head,  where rockcutting would be necessary),  twisting and  turning with it, till5 p.m., when, at a right-angled turn, we saw on our left Magrahel-Ithrara,  whose  western  half  drains  into  Murramiya.  Webaited at 6.15 p.m.  in the mouth of W. Geraia.     Rode  at 5.5 a.m. and at once Wacli  Osinan  widened  out.We  rode across it to the  tents of  Dakhilallah at  5.55  a.m.  Wehad  to stop there till 1.35 p.m. while  they  prepared saffron-riceand  a lamb.  We  then  rode  up  a side-valley,  and down intoOsman again at 2.15 p.m.   We followed it  down (it was not sozigzag in its course  as it  had been yesterday), till  4 p.m., when we turned  abruptly  to the right,  and found ourselves in WadiHamdh, which  here flows in  a narrow rock-walled  valley, about200  yards  wide.  The valley is bare at the  edges, of hard dampsand.  In the middle it is packed with aslam  wood, the groundbeing  leprous,  and  of a  white salty  colour, with  soft  bulbouspatches where  bushes grow or grew.  The water-beds are cut in a clean light clayey soil from one  to eight feet  deep, and  inthe  central  one was  a ghadir (brought  by W. Osinan) about two  feet deep, 250  feet long, and twelve feet broad.  The waterwas  sweet  and good.   Half a mile  above the ghadir, WadiHamdh ran  into Jebel Muraishida, and turned  abruptly northto get round it.     Faqeir is said to be about seven miles up.  From Ghadir Osinanwe rode at  6.30 p.m. along Hamdh, and at 7.15 pan. were oppositethe break where the  road from Wadi Osman to Aqila  (cUgla)reaches the Hamdh.   Our course  now 280o.  At 7.30 pan.  we
 turned  300o,  and  at  8.20 pan.  diverged  from  the  bed of Hamdh to the left, to sleep.   Wadi Hamdh is clearly distinguished from any other Hejaz  vvadi (except W. Yambo)  that I have seen, by the damp chill  that strikes up from  its valley.   This is of  course  most obvious  at night, when  the  mist  rises,  and everything glistens with damp ;  but even  in daytime Wadi Hamdh feels raw and cold and unnatural.     Started at 5.20 a.m.  along Wadi   Hamdh.  At 6.15  a.m. Wadi Murramiya came in on the left; it forms  by far the best road from Hamdh  to  Ais, and  from Wejh to Sidi  Abdullah&apos;s camp offers  the quickest and  smoothest  road.   We rode down it, into the brushwood of  W. Hamdb, where we found large pools of rain- water, some fresh, others gone  very green  and  stale.   WeJ;hen crossed the valley, left Wadi Dura on our right (the confluence of  Dura and  Murramiya  makes  the  plain  of Aqila, whose brackish well  is the only permanent  supply  in the district till Faqeir is reached) and rode past Bir  Aqila (on the  left, in the Hamdh  valley)  over a low watershed, to the landing ground at Din Jarad at 7.20 a.m.   From this point Major Ross&apos;s map  is available.  It is admirable.   I rode till W. Methar at 10.15  a.m., camped till 3 pun , and  then rode slowly (one  of us fell off his camel when racing and broke his arm and had to be left behind) till  6.20  pan.,  when  we  halted, with a, narrow gorge  to the south in  which are rock-pools of  water.     Started at 5 aan.   Halted  at  6 nan. in  Wadi Melha, north of  the  road,  which contains good water  pools.  Rode again. 6.45  aan. till .1.0.10 aan., when we  halted till  2.20 pan.   We then  marched  to  Bir   ibn  Rifada  in Khauthla,  at  4.50  pan. There are at least five wells in and near W.  Khauthla, and about them are small plants of rfdra-palm, one  or two grown-up dom- palms, and, at  Bir ibn Rifada, the drying remains of the palm and vegetable garden that  Suleiman began  to  make.  The well water had a purgative effect on our camels.   We rode again at 5.30 p.m. and camped between  the  Raals at  7.30 p.m.     Started, again  at 1.36 aan. and rode till 8.45 a.m. in the south edge of Murra.  From Sain, when men and camels were all tired, it seemed fit to the boy. Mohammed el-Gadhi, to run races.  So he took most of his clothes off, got  off his camel and challenged, any of us mounted to race him to a. clump of trees on the slope ahead, for a pound English.  All the party started off at once; the distance turned oiu\about three-quarters of a mile, uphill, over heavy sand. which  1  expect was more than  Mohammed  bad bargained  for, though he won by inches, he was absolutely done and collapsed bleeding  from his mouth  and nose.   Some  of our camels were very fast, and when racing in a mob,  as we.  were, they  do their best.  We put him on his camel, at 11a.m.; when we started; off to  march to Wejh at 5 pan., he was quite fit,  and again  playingall the little jests that had enlivened the march  from Abu Markha. If you come up quietly behind,a camel, poke a stick up its rump.and screech, it plunges off at a gallop.. very  disconcerting to its
rider.  It is also good  un to cannon another galloping camel intoa tree ; either the tree goes down (Hejaz trees  are very unstablethings) or the rider is  scratched, or best of all, is swept off hissaddle and left hanging on a, thorny branch.  This counts a bull,and is very popular- with the rest of tbe party.     The Bedu are odd people.   Travelling  with them is unsatis-factory for an Englishman unless he has patience deep and wideas the sea.  They are absolute slaves of their appetites, with  nostamina of mind, drunkards  for coffee, milk or water, gluttonsfor stewed meat, shameless beggars for tobacco.  A cigarette goesround four men in the tent before  it is finished; it would  be intolerable manners  to smoke it  all.   They  dream for  weeks before and after their rare sexual exercises, and spend their daystitillating themselves and their friends with bawdy tales.   Had thecircumstances of their life given them greater resources or oppor-tunity, the Beduins would, be mere sensualists.   It is  the povertyof Arabia, which makes them simple, continent and enduring.If they suspect you want to  drive them, either they  are  mulishor they go away : if you know them, and have the time and givethe trouble to present things their way, then the)&apos; in turn will doyour pleasure.   Whether the results you gain are worth the effortyou put forth, no man knoweth.   I  think  Europeans could  motor would not spend the time and thought and tact their  Sheikhsand  Emirs  expend  each day, on such  meagre objects.   Theirprocesses are clear, their minds moving as one&apos;s own moves, withnothing  incomprehensible  or radically different, and they will follow us, if  we can endure with them, and  play their  game.The pity is, we break down with exasperation, and throw the mover-.                                                   T.E.L.                 In Sherif Abdullah?* Camp.     Captain T. E.  Lawrence, whose report on his journeys toand  from  Sherif Abdullah&apos;s camp,  as  well as on  the two chiefraids in which he took part, have appeared  separately, sent  also an account of his stay in the camp itself.  From this we take thefollowing notes :      Abdullah had a force of about 3,000 men, mostly  Ateibah.These Capt. Lawrence thought very inferior as fighting men tothe Harb and Juheinah. being  unadulterated  Bedouins.   TheirSheikhs are ignorant men, lacking in influence and character, andthe)&apos; appear to be without interest in the campaign.  They  alsoknew nothing of the country they are in.  Abdullah himself wasleading rather an irresponsible hedonistic existence.  His* tastesappear to be  pronouncedly literary.  He take  great  interest inthe war in Europe  and follows the operations on the Somme andthe  general course of  European .politics most closely  (throughArabic newspapers which he  spends most of the day in  reading).
&quot;1  was surprised to  find,&quot; says Capt. Lawrence, &quot;that he knew the family relationships of  the Royal  Houses of Europe and  the names and characters of their ministers.&quot;   He believes that hecould make himself supreme in Yemen.   If he  succeeded,  &quot; itwould transform the Sherifs state from a  loose hegemony ofBedouin tribes into a populous, wealtlry and vigorous kingdom ofvillagers and townspeople.&quot;  Capt.  Lawrence adds, with justice.that all past movements of importance in Arabia have been thework of the settled peoples, not of the tribes.     Sheikhs Shakir  and  Dakhilallah  el-Gadhi  were  the   twooutstanding personalities in the camp.   Both are  men  of  action.and the first has an authority hardly inferior to that of the Kingor his sons.  The Ateibah worship him,  Dakhilallah is  hereditarylawman of the  Juheihab and possesses some  science, speakingTurkish well.   In fact,  he  was with the Turks  up  to  december last and came clown with them to Nakhl Mubarak.   He seems tobe a man of energy, resolution and  persistence.     In regard to railway raids, Capt. Lawrence gives a  rough listof those carried out during  his stay from March 24 to  April  (i.&quot;March 24.  Bueir.       Sixty rails dynamited  and telegraph                            cut.   ,,  25.   Abu el-Naam.  Twenty-five rails dynamited, water-                            tower,   two   station   buildings                            seriously  damaged  by  shell  fire,                            seven box-wagons and  wood store                            and  tents destroyed  by fire, tele-                            graph  cut,   engine  and   bogie                            damaged.    ,,  27.

Bueir.         Twenty-two rails cut, culvert blown                             up, telegraph cut.     &quot;The Turks lost about thirty-six killed, and  Ave took someseventy prisoners and deserters during the operations.     &quot;From April 7  a regular service of dynamiters was begun,from  Ain Turaa, working against the Mudahrfj-Abu el-Naamsection, and from Bueir against  the  Istabl Antar-Bowat section.Dynamiters have been ordered to  blow up not more  than  fiverails per night  and do something every  night.    The result  ofthe first three nights&apos; work was satisfactory, but no later detailshaA^e reached me.&quot;
     In conclusion, Cant. Lawrence pays a - tribute  to  Abdullah\ssincerity ancl earnestness, while  lie thinks him not  a military commander or a man of. action in any  way.  He is too fond  ofpleasure and, in. a sense, evidently too civilized for his  presentwild work.   Capt.  Lawrence, hoAvever,  got him  to  do  a gooddeal to pay up the Ateibah (whose allowances were in arrears),to take an interest in his guns and machine-guns, to send out hisdynamite parties, and  to  begin to prepare for  a  general  movutowards the railway.   The  report  ends  with an  optimisticforecast.     &quot;  As regards the situation, at Medina, I  think  the great bulkof  the  troops  and practically all  stores have been evacuatednorthward in small parties by rail.  The programme for a route-march  of the main hod)7 to el-Ula has (wisely, 1 think,  for  theTurks) been, abandoned, and the  fall&apos;of Medina is now merely ;rquestion of  when  the Arabs  like to  put an  end   to the affair;;The Turks have little food, but so small a garrison that the question has less importance.   No  food is going in from the  north,  sothat sooner or later starvation  will   ensue.   Till  it does,  theArabs  will probably not enter the town, since.the Emirs are, all-anxious  to  avoid  warlike  action,  against  the  place itself,  forreligious reasons.&quot;                       Railway  Raiding.     Interim reports,  covering  the  period  between  April   17and  May  2,  have  been  received   from  Colonel... NeAvcombe.Thanks to  his  persistence, he succeeded  in  effecting  his objectof cutting telegraph  and rails rive or six  times, but his report is  mainly a record of  disappointments, of missed opportunitiesand  of good  plans  spoilt  by  the  indiscipline,  instability  of purpose, cowardice and general  un trustworthiness,  not  only  ofthe Bedouin forces accompanying him, but; also of  the  Sheikhsat their  head.   Explosives j)romised are  not sent, rendezvousarranged  are not  kept, desertions  take   place at  the criticalmoment,  supplies  are  not  forwarded, and  so  on ;  a drearycatalogue  of the difficulties  experienced  by trained  Europeanofficers in carrying out,, with inadequate human, material,  plans which  would  be perfectly easy  of execution  if only reasonableco-operation on the part of subordinates could be secured.     Colonel Newcombe  was working in the  district roundKhishm Sanaa, Muadhdbam and Abu Taqa.  The damage done to the line  consisted -in removing or destroying a few rails andlengths of telegraph, wire, and was never so serious as  to requiremore  than  a few hours work  by the trolley-parties  sent  outpromptly by the Turks.   Colonel Newcombe  more than  oncesays that  the obstacles put by the Turks in the way of  his effortsat destruction&apos;are far less serious than those proceeding from hisown people.                                    &apos;       ,,v&apos;
     It appears from information, obtained from  a few prisoners captured that  food difhcul ties  are  considerable.   Trains  passdaily in  spite of the cutting  of the line, but they only carrytroops and no  food.  The majority of Arab  troops, therefore,and  many Turks are anxious to desert, if  only  a way  can  beHound.                    Aden Protectorate.                Raid into the Fadhli Country.     The  Resident,  Aden, reports  that on  April 18,  when  the 33rd Punjabis were in  harbour awaiting naval  escort to East Africa, they were used for a landing at Wadi  Bana in  order  to raid Musemir  in the Fadhli country.  He appends an account of the  expedition  by  Captain  Reilly,  who  accompanied  it   as Assistant Political. Officer.     &quot; I left Aden in the troopship &apos; Purnea,&apos;  on the afternoon of  April  18,  with  the  force  under the  command  of  Major Graham.  I took with me Sultan Ahmed el-Mehdar and his slave, Mohammed  Marzuk.   Mr.  Ali  Ibrahim  accompanied me   as interpreter.    We reached the shore near  el-Kaud early next morning, and  I disembarked in the  first boat from the  &apos; Purnea,&apos; and proceeded-at once to el-Kaud.   1 was, however, too late  to arrest  Mohammed bin Abdullah and Salim bin  Abdullah,  whose houses are at this village.   The former has  a dar into which 1 went.   He had left his women in it, but he  himself was said  to have gone to  the Fulesi country two days earlier.   Salim bin Abdullah had  a &quot; Kutcha  &quot; house.   He had  left that morning on. seeing the ships.  Sultan Ahmed el-Mehdar was welcomed  by those villagers who were present, but the majority  had  fled.  The Arabs  reported that two earner sowars had left at dawn  for Lahej to report our arrival, and that the Fadhli  Sultans  son, Abdullah: bin Husein, had  gone personally  to  Ali  Said Pasha  to ask  for assistance.  The people said that the Turks had left their post at Ba Sharara six days previously, and had a:one to Harur, a party of them having gone on to el-Raha.  Sultan Husein was said to be at Shukra.  Salim  bin  Abdullah&apos;s house was  destroyed with the assent  of Sultan  Ahmed el-Mehdar,  who suggested that it would be a good thing to destroy Ba Shahara also.     &quot;Wethen proceeded to Musemir, where we found that mostof the villagers had  fled, but those  who remained were friendly,and  the headman  Ali  Mansur  (also called  Ali  Mohammed) invited  Major Graham and  the officers into  his  house, as the force rested  here  or a short  time.  Ali bin Ahmed, the Fadhli Sultan&apos;s  son-in-law,  whom  I  had  instructions  to arrest  and whose  house  is at  this  village, was said to have  left that morning with his family.  While we were at Musemir information
was   brought  that  the  Fadhlfs  men  were  then  removingammunition and stores from  the  dar at Ba Shahara.  This darwas  occupied by  the  Turks  when they  were  at  Ba Shahara.On receipt of this information  (which was given to me  through mr..   Ali  Ibrahim),  Major  Graham  immediately  marched toBa, Shahara.  On our arrival at the dar  a few Arabs  openedfire on the scouts and  then  retired  to a  distance of  about 500yards, where they were joined by others  and from  there theyagain  opened fire.  Meanwhile we  had occupied  the  dar, inwhich was found nine boxes of M.H. ammunition and a quantityof grain.   The Arabs were driven off with the assistance of twomachine-guns mounted  on the top of  the dar.  They were saidto belong  to the  Marquashi  tribe  of  the Fadhlis,  and  werepresumably  covering their  retirement- with stores which, theyhad removed from the fort.  1 do not know whether  there were any  casualties amongst them.   Major Graham consulted meabout the  desirability of destroying  the dar.   As we had beenfired  upon by the Arabs in  charge  of it,  and as  it is used bytbe  Turks as a post, and might be  so used again, I.  consideredthat  it would be a  good thing to demolish it.  There were nomeans available of blowing it up. but it was partially demolished,and   this work  was continued  next morning hj  the  guns ofH.M.S. &apos; Topaz.&apos;   The ammunition found was brought away, andthe grain  destroyed.  Grain found in  the villagers&apos; houses wasnot touched.  Meanwhile it was reported that two guns (smooth-bore  muzzle-loading field-guns  of old British make) had been. found at  the village of  Zangcbnr, and these  Major Graham hadblown up after consulting me.                               .     &quot;The force then returned to el-Kaud, which, was  reached at about 6.45 p.m., and there we were  rejoined  by Sultan  Ahmedel-Mehdar and his slave, together with six women, four  men and four  children, dependents of the Sultan, whom he wished  to bring to Aden.   The force spent the night on the sea-shore,  and was-embarked early this  morning,  whereupon  the &quot; Pnrnea&quot; left for Aden.     &quot; While ashore I was informed that the Fulesi Sultan bad been.captured by  the Turks.  The people  in all  the  villages through.which we passed had been alarmed at our approach, and most hadrunaway ;  but those who remained seemed friendly and  not at alldispleased at the destruction  of the dar, Sultan Ahmed el-Mehdainon the contrary appearing to be very glad of it.   The peopleseemed dissatisfied with the conduct of the Turks in  interfering with their ha/ilas.&apos;&apos;
                        .  NOTES.                -  -Oman,     Muscat reports (up to the end of March) that there are signsof the local &quot; lmam&apos;s &quot; popularity being on the decline as a resultof his efforts to raise zakat in advance.  Rain has been scantyand the pomegranate harvest a failure.   The  spirit of rebellion,therefore, is not only quiescent, but possibly  dying down.   the arrival in Muscat of Ali ibn Sail, agent of Sheikh Hatnyar ibnNasir,  as a guest of the  Sultan, is regarded  as symptomatic  ofsome attempt at a pacific arrangement being on foot.South Arabia.           .     Aden reports, under date May  8, that the  Kaiti Sultan  ofMakalla  is  no nearer a  settlement of his difficulties with theKathiri  of  the Hadhramaut, except for the one fact, that AliSaid Pasha has written  to the latter stating his inability to armthem or in  other ways  assist  them.  On the other hand, theAulaki  Sheikhs, from both the Upper and Lower districts andalso  from JBir&apos; Id, are reported to have gathered  at Makalla,  tomake an agreement with  the Kaiti, under  which one shall  assistanother  against  the  Turks.   &apos; The   Sherif  of  Beban  hascongratulated us on the capture of Baghdad, and says that he hasprotected the Kadi Atik  against a Turkish plot on  his life.   It isrumoured, but notyet confirmed, that the old Fadhli  Sultan has:been deposed at last in favour of Abdul Kadim, has accepted thesituation, and has withdrawn to his  dar in the hills. Yemen.     Aden sends us news, under  date  May  15, which  suggeststhat earlier information  (see No. 37  p. 556 and No. 38 p. 23)respecting a  son  of the  Imam Yahya  leading  an anti-Turkmovement was- erroneous  in one important detail at least.  the leader, Mohammed Yahya, is no son of the Imam, but  a seyyidof the Qasim bouse of Sanaa,(the  present Imam belongs  to  theShehara branch of that house), and  is  perhaps the same who hasbeen Emir of Midan  in  the Hashid country.  His full  name isnow given as  Mohammed Yahya  ibn el-Hadi ibn el-Muayyadbillah  el-Qasim.  No doubt he is.  the individual indicated  inMustafa Idrisi&apos;s report printed in our No. 30 p. 445.   He seemsto have numerous and influential support  and will probably  be heard of  again, for, according to latest  information, his faction isgaining  strength.   It is  thought that Idrisi  may come  to terms with it  in order to oust his  enemy, the reigning Imam, and to.secure, as his price, the. Yemen Tihamah district which he covets.By  himself he  seems unlikely to  realize his ambitions.  TheTurks are evidenthy holding him up on the south, having moved,it is reported, their Hodeidah and Zebid garrisons up to Jarb onthe Abs border.  The Hashid and  Bekil  tribes  are  said to bebehind the revolutionary  movement ;  and if these will  fight  for it, they  will be more effective than if called out at the bidding ofIdrisi.
     The results of our blockade of Yemen ports grow more andmore unsatisfactory owing to the exception of Idrisi&apos;s ports and lack of control by  idrisis officers over  the  coastal trade.  OnMay 6, boats from  our  patrol  raided the dhow anchorage  ofDubab south  of Mokha and  destroyed  twenty  craft ; and onMay 8, twelve dhows and  some  stores were destroyed at IhnAbbas, opposite . Kamaran, in  retaliation  for frequent firing onour boats.I tin  11 adhdhal and the Amur at.     Under date Ma)&apos; 17, Baghdad  informs  us that Fahad IbnHadhdhal has, at, last, given definite proof of  friendly sentimentsin  two messages to the C.P.O.   The active co-operation of thisParamount, Chief of the  south-western  Anezah, though it maynot be given  until we have  pressed the  Turks  a little  furtherhack  up the Euphrates  and  so opened sufficient markets to theAmarat, will be of great value on both sides of the Hamad desert.From the same source we learn, that the Yezidis of Jebel Sinjar,in  north  mid-Mesopotamia., are prepared  to come  out actively onour side.General Maude and.  the Shiah Holy Cities.     Owing to errors of ciphering and  transmission, information has reached us  in a mutilated state  from Baghdad under dateMay 20, to the effect that General Maude and someone  else (Mr.Storrs ?) have paid  an official visit to Kerbela, ISfejef aud  Kufa.In the first they had a cordial reception, from both  the towns-people and the Ulema, and found that  the town had preserved itsshrine and treasure practically intact.   At Nejef the  populacecame out to greet them.   There and at Kerbela the intermissionof  the pilgrimage has caused much poverty, and a sum of money was given by the General for immediate  distribution.  At  Kufa.the principal mujtahids received the visitors.  All these towns-people are well  armed  and defy the Bedouins : but the Ulemawould like to see less warlike conditions re-established, under theguarantee of British  troops not at present available.   meanwhile the town sheikhs have been  made responsible.
