SECRET.236APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XVIII.                                     RUSSIA.     THE reception accorded by  M. Terestchenko of  the  British redefinition  of  war aims in respect to  territorial alterations  is most gratifying.  If he can only persuadeM. Tseretelli and M. Tchernof to share his view, much  mav be done to counteract  theGerman-inspired  misrepresentations of Britain as a  self-seeking  Imperialistic  Power.Sir George  Buchanan&apos;s interview  with the three most  advanced  members  of  theGovernment  seems  to  have  done  great  good,  and the  readiness  of  the  BritishGovernment  to allow other  Labour men to visit Petrograd is likely to allay suspicionstill further.   It is perhaps advisable to&apos; remember that though  labour  is at presentthe controlling force in Petrograd, there are  other forces at work, especially in  south russia, which cannot be neglected notably the Jews.  The  latter control the provincialpress, and in the  Ukraine have, by  their superior education, a power  all the greaterbecause it is not always apparent superficially.  The emancipated  Jewish intelligentsiais an organised section of the Russian body politic which must be taken into accountpolitically, and it might be  worth while  to get British and  American Jewry into closertouch with it.     The reception accorded to the Allied representatives in the Opera House at Odessais  most  reassuring.   One  hopes that such a spirit  may  spread to the  front,  wheredesertions and disintegration still  prevail to such  an alarming  extent, and  wheredisorganisation of the means of transportation  must threaten  not only  the militaryefficiency of the armies but  even famine.   These Opera House demonstrations cannotbe relied upon to show permanent  sentiment.  A  Russian  crowd is ready to cheeralmost anything, and speeches are soon forgotten.     If the Russian Government decide  to publish the  proposed secret offensive treaty between  the late  Emperor and  the Kaiser, the last shreds  of sympathy felt in  thiscountry  for  the  former will  disappear.   But  we  must remember  that any suchpublication will act as a spur to the growing  suspicion  among the democracies  of theworld  against  what is termed  the secret control of foreign policy by departmentaloligarchies.     The behaviour of the  Italian  Ambassador  in Petrograd seems  to have beendeplorable.     The definition of &quot;no annexations  and  no indemnities&quot; accepted  by the RussianGovernment from M. Vandervelde is satisfactory.                                     TURKEY.     The suggested intervention of Mr. Morgenthau, the Jewish ex-Ambassador of theUnited States to Constantinople,  in  the sense of a separate peace with  Turkey  isimportant.   If  Russia  is ready to forgo  the  territorial  acquisition  of  the Straits(including Constantinople) and to accept internationalisation or neutralisation undernominal or effective Turkish suzerainty, the Young Turks risk a revolution against their war policy and would doubtless be desirous of concluding a separate peace.   Apart from
the fate of the Straits and Constantinople, any peace on democratic lines must imply the absolute cessation of Turkish misrule in the six Armenian vilayets, in Arabia south ofthe Taurus, and  impliedly in Palestine.   The  question  arises,  can Mr.  Morgenthauarrange for a jDeace on these lines, which will contain guarantees for its permanence and against its being upset by the Young Turks once the present conflagration is ended andwhen the  world  will be reluctant  to  renew the  conflict.  Past Turkish history is  nothopeful on this point.   The Armenians, Arabs (especially the  King of Hejaz), and  theJews  have special claims on us in the matter,  while we cannot be unmindful of thedanger of German economic penetration in the Ottoman Empire and of the necessity of safeguarding the  Red Sea route.                                     ARABIA.    The instructions given by  the French Government to Mustapha Cherchali  arevery  remarkable.   The deliberate misrepresentation  of the  attitude of  the BritishGovernment regarding the bank at Jeddah is  serious.   Colonel Bremoncrs mission was definitely  understood to have been absolutely non-political in character, vide the pledge given by M. Picot on p. 2 of Arabian Beport No. VP dated the 22nd August.    French intentions  in  Syria are  surely incompatible with the war aims of  theAllies as defined to the Russian  Government.  If the self-determination of  nationalitiesis to be the principle, the  interference  of France  in  the selection  of advisers by theArab  Government and the suggestion by France of the Emirs to be selected by  theArabs in  Mosul, Aleppo,  and Damascus would seem  utterly incompatible with  ourideas  of liberating the Arab nation and of establishing a free and independent arab state.  The British  Government,  in  authorising  the letters  despatched  to  king hussein before  the outbreak  of the  revolt by  Sir Henry McMahon, would seem toraise a doubt as to whether our pledges to King  Hussein  as head  of  the  Arab nationare consistent with French intentions to make not only Syria but Upper Mesopotamiaanother Tunis.    If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguishedorigin and prestige means anything  it  means that we  are  prepared to recognise  thefull sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria.  It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our  detailed pledges to King Hussein, andto  make  it  clear to the  latter  whether he or  someone  else is to  be the ruler of damascus, which is the one possible capital  for an Arab State,  which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.                                                                       W.  0.-G.    May 31, 1917.

Buchanan instructing  him to make a communication to the Russian Government, on the 24th May, in reply to a note declaratory of its war policy, in which was enclosed a  copy of its proclamation to the Russian people.   In thisproclamation was a sentiment  in  which the  British Government heartily concurred that free Russia did not purpose to dominate other peoples, or to take from them their national patrimony, or to  occupy foreign  territory forcibly.  The  British  Governmententered upon this war to enforce  respect for international engagements  and to defend the existence of their country; they did not enter upon it as a war of conquest, andthey were  not  continuing it with any such  object.  The  liberation of peoples oppressedby alien tyranny had  now been added to the original objects; and  the British Govern-ment rejoiced that Prussia had  announced  her intention to  liberate Poland, inclusive ofthe parts now annexed  to the Germanic  Empires.  No less did  it i*ejoice that  largeparts of Armenia had been enfranchised from the  hideous misgovernment of Turkey, andit trusted that the rest would be equally freed from oppression; the Hejaz Arabs hadfreed themselves by their own exertions, and those in Mesopotamia had been freed byBritish arms.   No one could wish that any  of these peoples should be again subjected to turkey.  If the  native  populations of the German colonies,  now  occupied by british forces, were returned to German rule, it  would be  almost equally deplorable, and it wouldnot be easy to explain the reasons therefor to the  British democracies in Australasia andSouth Africa.  The British Government had no  territorial  ambitions in Europe, but itrecognised the claims  of its Allies to security and restoration, not to aggrandisement.       [898-45]                                .                            B
&quot;In the  final peace those, provinces  which  by. sentiment  and  nationality belonged to our allies must be restored to them.&quot;   Before all, such a settlement in Europe andAsia as would secure the happiness and  contentment  of the peoples and take away alllegitimate causes of future war must be sought for.  The British Government joined itsBussian allies in its approval and acceptance of  the principles laid  down, in his message to Congress, by President Wilson.  The  British Government believed that the agree-ments made with its allies were, broadly  speaking, conformable to these standards ;  but,it was quite ready, with its allies, to examine and, if it  should be necessary, revise them,if the Russian Government so desired.     Sir G.  Buchanan telegraphed on the 24th May [No. 765] that he  had handed  the note to M. Terestclienko, who was much  pleased with it, saying that it would strengthenhis position, and had promised to translate it  himself.   On the  following day he  tele-graphed again [No. 775] saying that his  attention had  been called by  M. Terestchenkoto the sentence  in the note &quot; In the final peace,&quot; &amp;c, who had said that, as he did  not know what meaning was attached to the word &quot; sentiment,&quot; he found it  difficult to  fixon the right Russian word for its translation; if it were so translated as to convey themeaning of &quot; sentimental reasons,&quot; the press of  the Extreme Left would at  once seizeon the phrase, for the  contention of the Russian Socialist parties was that no territorycould be  disposed  of  without the consent of its  inhabitants.  M. Terestchenko wouldbe grateful if some words more in consonance  with the Socialist  views  could  be  substi-tuted ;  he wanted to bring out that any transfer  of territory must be  made in accordancewith the wishes of its inhabitants.  In reply, Lord R. Cecil telegraphed on  the 28thMay [No. 1076] saying that the sentence might be altered by changing the words afterprovinces to &quot; whose inhabitants are bound to our allies by ties of. race  and  sympathyshould be united to them,&quot; and instructing Sir G. Buchanan to inquire of M. Terestchenkowhether this change would meet his views.    . Sir R.  Rodd telegraphed from Rome  on the 23rd May j No. 449] that Baron Sonnino,whilst generally agreeing with the terms of the note, had also taken exception to  thissentence  &quot; In the final peace,&quot; &amp;c,  as the words &quot;restored  to them&quot; might seemto exclude the transfer of provinces to Italy, and therefore he suggested the substitution of the  word &quot; united.&quot;    On  the 25th May,  Lord  R. Cecil  telegraphed  to  Sir G.Buchanan [No.  1050] that there was no  objection to the alteration suggested by BaronSonnino, though if the note had been delivered it was of no  importance.     Sir G.  Buchanan and the Socialist Ministers. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the27th May [No.  779] that on the  previous day  he-had called on M. Terestchenko  and found  him  engaged  in  conference   with his  Socialist  colleagues  (MM.  Tseretelli,Chernoff, and Scobeleff), who expressed a wish to  put  certain questions to him.  Afterthe  introduction he said  that  he was very  glad to  have the opportunity  to  correcterroneous  impressions in regard to himself:  he had of course  had nothing to do withthe  revolution, but he had always espoused the cause of freedom and constitutional government, and in his audience with the late  Emperor, with which he was sometimesreproached, he  had suggested  the appointment  of Ministers like those who were  nowmembers of the Government.     M. Tseretelli, who acted as spokesman, expressed his  satisfaction and then askedwhether the revolution had had any repercussion in England, whether it was likely tobring the views of the British and Russian democracies into closer  union, and whetherthe British Government really represented  public opinion.  Sir G. Buchanan repliedthat such a revolution could not fail to react  on other countries;  that no Governmentcould  remain in  office if it  did not  represent public  opinion; that  though we weremonarchical the Ring was only the first  servant of the people, and  he had by  far  lesspower than the Presidents of France and the United States.     M. Tseretelli then turned to the  question of agreements,  and  virtually&apos; askedwhether if Russia Avere to renounce  the advantages  accruing  to her under them weshould be prepared to do the  same.   To this he replied  by summarising the views inthe British note to the publication of which M. Terestchenko consented.     M. Tseretelli next asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would consent to the holding of an allied conference to bring about  a  complete agreement as to the aims of the war and eventual peace  terms.   To this he  had replied that he could not  give an answer without consulting his Government; but when pressed for his personal viewshe had said that we had gone  far in  that direction  in  expressing  our readiness to re-examine  and, if need  be, revise our agreements, which entailed an exchange of views.     M. Tseretelli then dwelt on the necessity of maintaining the closest contact between
the British and  Russian democracies  by means of visits exchanged between&apos;the repre-&apos;sentatlv.es;df the various Labour and Socialist groups. i. 1.1 e assured him, iwreiplyj-th&apos;^this wish was cordially shared, and  told  him that Mr. Henderson would leave-&apos; iuime^diately for Petrograd.   At this  he expressed satisfaction, coupled with a fear that HisMajesty&apos;s Government  did  not wish for the representatives of other groups  to visitRussia, such as Mr. Ramsay Macdonald ; he asked whether he could tell the WorkmeiiVCouncil  that this was wrong, and that Mr. Macdonald would  be given facilities.   He(Sir G. Buchanan) replied that he could not speak in the name of his Government, but his personal conviction was that such facilities would be given.     Before the Socialist Ministers left to attend  a meeting of the Workmen s Council,he asked them whether  that  body could be counted on  to support  the  Government ;M.  Tseretelli replied that with the exception of a small minority it could  be so countedon, and that it desired the democratisation and not the demoralisation of the army.     Later in the evening M. Terestchenko told him  that  the Socialist  Ministers hadtelephoned to say that the report of the interview had made an excellent impression.     M. Vandervelde on the Situation. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on  the 27th May[No. 780] that M. Vandervelde had given him a copy of the report he  had sent to hisGovernment.  .His points are  briefly as follows : (1.) The influence  of the advocates of&quot; peace at any price&quot; is decreasing,  and  even among  the extremists there are hardlyany advocates of a  separate peace.   (2.) The extremists  are  represented  in theWorkmen&apos;s Council by a very  small minority.  (3.)  There is a strong  movement infavour of an international socialist  conference, with  German  participation.  (4.)  the entrance of the leaders of the Workmen&apos;s Council is exercising a good influence on theefficiency and unity of action  of the Government.  (5.) M.  Kerensky&apos;s appointment  as  minister of War is likely to have good  results.   (6.) All  members  of the Governmentwith whom he  has spoken  declare  that  the expression &quot; no contributions or annexa-tions&quot;  merely excludes penal indemnities and  annexation of  territory against thewishes  of the. inhabitants.   (7.) In short, though the  situation is  far  from beingsatisfactory there were many  favourable signs.    M. Vandervelde and his  colleague considered that  a  meeting of allied socialistswith  Germans  who  admit. their  solidarity with  the  German Emperor  would  be dangerous and useless.    Agreement as to Military Service. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on  the 25th May[No. 771] that M. Tersstchenko bad promised  to give  him an official  reply  on the morrow in regard to the proposed agreement : it would  be  to  the  effect  that Russiansubjects might be called upon to take service in  the British army if they declined  toreturn for service in the Russian.     The Fleet. M. Terestchenko informed Sir G.  Buchanan [No. 757] that M. Kerensky,who had just  returned from a  flying  visit  to  Plelsingfors, was  delighted with theimprovement  already effected in  the fleet, and was hopeful as  to the  success of his efforts to bring officers and men together.    Evacuation of the British Colony. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on  the 23rd May[No.  753] that  he  had issued  a  circular  to   the   consuls  informing  them  thatM.  Terestchenko  had   said  that  the  Government  was  fully alive to  the  critical situation created by  the workmen&apos;s demands and was doing everything possible  todeal with it and that foreign subjects would be protected if necessary with troops; buthe  had begged him (Sir G. Buchanan) to counteract  the impression that  the  Britishcolony was being evacuated in a body, as were that impression to prevail we should be accused of creating a panic  and be  bitterly attacked, and  the position  of those thatremained would become far worse.  He  himself entirely agreed with  M. Terestchenko&apos;view as to the necessity for avoiding  any appearance  of panic;  the consuls should, hesaid, categorically deny, if they thought  it necessary,  in the press,  any serious rumoursto  the  effect that  British colonies  were  being advised to leave.   Consular recom-mendations of repatriation  should, at any  rate  at first, be strictly confined to women and children living in the provinces and in outlying places where  immediate dangerthreatened,and military protection should be unobtainable.  As regarded the town in.which a consul resided, Sir G. Buchanan thought it would be well  to obtain a promise-from the military authorities that  immediate  military  protection should  be afforded toany British subjects who might be in  danger.   Further, consuls should, when the time came,  only  repatriate  very small detachments at a time.   Telegraphing again on the
2itf v May [No. 761] ho said that tie was most un w i 1 ling to ask Tor a special train, as that-^oitldoreate;&apos;a&apos;;very: Dadi:ihapr^ssion and  provoke attacks on us.  To arrange  for the gradual departure of Svomeh  and children living in dangerous districts iv^s  all thathe could do. &apos;  ; :!     Workmen&apos;s Claims. Sir G.  Buchanan  telegraphed on the 24th May [No. 767]saying that M. Terestchenko had spoken of the extravagant demands of the workmen,which, he said, would, if conceded, paralyse  industry and invite national bankruptcy.Most serious  consideration was  being given to this,  and  it was  proposed to invitethe owners of factories, &amp;c, to consent to a temporary tax of 80 per cent, on all profits,so as to bring home to the men the unreasonableness of their demands and to strengthen the position of the Government.     Congress of Soldiers and Officers&apos; Deputies on the Rumanian Front. The consul-general at Odessa telegraphed on the 25th May [No. 50] that all the allied consuls hadbeen present by invitation at the meeting held on the 24th May.  General Shcherbachovhad  been very frank  in  his  opening speech, and had told them that discipline must be restored.  Many speeches followed, the last being made by a peasant deputy, who saidthat they had sworn to send all deserters back to the front, and to supply all the forageand grain they had.  The Trench consul then asked permission to speak, and told themthat peace  could only  be obtained through victory.   His speech was received with enthusiasm.   The Serbian consul followed, imploring the Bussian army to save Serbia;the audience, of about  2,000, rose to  a  man and, with  uplifted hands, swore to freeSerbia.   The  consul-general  himself was then called upon, and he urged the necessityof crushing German  militarism  xo assure  a lasting  peace and a  free world.   Hisreception, he said, &quot; before, during, and after &quot; his speech was enthusiastic.  The Belgianconsul&apos; then told them that  Belgium had done its duty and they must do theirs : his remarks were  very pointed, but he was loudly applauded.  The  consul-general said thathe had been  assured by the delegates  that the artillery and cavalry  had steadilyremained well disciplined.  The impression made on him as to the feeling and wishes ofthe army was  very favourable.    Propaganda. -Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  27th  May  [No.  781] that onthe initiative of M. Thorus [? Thomas] a group had been formed for propaganda work by  means  of pamphlets.  It was proposed  to distribute a  million copies  of newpamphlets or  leaflets  along the  front  and throughout Bussia every day for the next three months.  The  printing and distribution  were to  be done by the staff of the&quot; Novoe Vremya.&quot; There would be a Financial Commission composed of Bussian andFrench, and, if we joined, British representatives to control expenditure, as well as aliterary committee to deal  with the subjects treated and their composition.  Thetotal  sum  required for  the  purpose  was 1,000,000 roubles.   M.  Thorus [? Thomas]proposed to  contribute  10,000L,  and he  &quot;was very  anxious that we should do thesame.  He (Sir G. Buchanan) thought that it was essential that we should do  so, asif we did not share in expenses the pamphlets, which were to be of an allied character,would leave us altogether out of account.   If Flis  Majesty&apos;s  Government sanctionedthis expenditure of 10,OOOZ. now asked for, it  would  have to   be in  addition  to thegrant of 10,000L  already given.   It  was  only,  however, by work  of this kind thatwe could reach the Russian masses, and it would, he was  confident, prove a profitableinvestment.    The late  Emperor s  Secret Treaty.   [See  Eastern  Report XVII, p. 3] Sir G.Buchanan telegraphed on the 25th May  [No. 774] that M.  Terestchenko had shownhim a copy of the telegram which had been sent  to the Russian  Ambassador  in Berlinon  the  10th November,  1905,  giving  the  text  of  the secret  treaty between theGerman Emperor  and the Emperor of Bussia, which had been proposed by the formeron  his arrival at Bjorki on the  24th July  of  that  year, and signed  by the  latterwithout the knowledge of Count Lamsdorff, he also undertaking to  do his utmost tosecure the adhesion of France.  This being found to be impracticable, Count Lamsdorffinstructed the Russian Ambassador to inform the German Emperor that the clauses  ofthe treaty must remain inoperative so far as France was concerned, as the Emperor ofRussia had  to respect, the treaties  concluded by his father.   The treaty concludedbetween  the  two Emperors  in  1905 was to the  effect that  in  the event of eithercountry being attacked, the other should support  it wdth its full military and  naval force, and that neither should make peace without consent of the- other.  As Great
 Britain  was  evidently  the country  against  which  the  treaty had  been  directed, M. Terestchenko thought that the British Government ought to be made acquainted with its  contents, and he would be glad to know its views in  regard to the question of publication.   The text of the treaty had been communicated to the French President of the Council.   Lord R. Cecil telegraphed on the 29th May [No. 1087] to say  that the  British  Government did not wish  to express any opinion; it appeared to  be  a matter entirely for the Bussian Government.     The Italian  Ambassador  in  Petrograd. Sir  G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 26th May [No. 778] that M. Terestchenko had informed him that the Italian Ambas- ambassador  had on the  previous  day, in the course of  conversation, said that  they  (the Italians) had had considerable  success  on  the  frontier of  Austria,  of  which he (M.  Terestchenko) was so fond.   In reply  to an expression of surprise at such a&quot;state- ment, the Ambassador went  on to  ask whether his sympathies  were not with Austria, and whether he was not then engaged in pourparlers with her.   M. Terestchenko had replied that he would pass over the personal insult, but, as Minister, he could not allow the incident to pass ;  and he should instruct the Russian Ambassador in Rome to bring it to the notice of the Italian Foreign Minister, and to  enquire whether the Ambassador was speaking in the name of his Government.                                   RUMANIA.     Opening of Parliament. -Parliament was  reopened on the 19th  May, and the first sitting  of the Chamber  was,  Sir G. Barclay telegraphed  [No.   274],  marked by acrimonious personalities  foreshadowing a stormy session.   The leader of the Labour party announced its programme, the publication of which had hitherto been prevented by the Censor; it goes further than the Prime Ministers programme of reforms and is socialistic in tone.     Jewish Que8tion.-J.Ji the  same  telegram [No. 274] Sir G. Barclay  said that the Prime  mini steps  statement at the opening of Parliament contained a reference to the Jewish question, which must now  be solved, as its aspect had changed from the moment that Rumania had decided to  enter the war for the acquisition of neighbouring Rumanian territories in which Jews enjoyed political rights.                                    TURKEY.     Internal Conditions. Mr. Balfour telegraphed on  the 23rd May that the  Secretary of State  had informed him that he  gathered  that  the conditions of Turkey were very bad; that the food problem, in Constantinople and  elsewhere, was  of the most serious character ; that the Germans were  detested; and  that the Turkish  authorities were in a mood to consider the terms of a separate peace. His informants were Mr.  Morgenthau,formerly  Ambassador at Constantinople, and their former consul-general in  the Balkans. The  former had  been on very good terms with&apos; the Turkish authorities in Constan- tinople, and was apparently quite confident that he could renew relations  with, at  any rate, some of them. He was willing to go to Switzerland, unofficially, to see if anything could be  done in  the  way of negotiations,  and he seemed very confident that such a mission would not be fruitless.  The  Secretary of State was  convinced that in making this offer he was animated only by a desire  to  do public service.  Mr. Balfour told the Secretary of State  that, speaking offhand and without consultation with his Govern-ment, he saw no objection to Mr. Morgenthau cautiously feeling the ground with his Turkish friends in Switzerland or  some other neutral country.     In regard to  this, Lord R. Cecil telegraphed to Mr. Barclay on  the L&apos;6th  May [No. 1917]  saying that the Cabinet entirely agreed  with Mr.  Balfour&apos;s  reply, whichshould be officially confirmed.  Mr.  Barclay should add that  it  was doubtful whetheruseful work could be accomplished in  Switzerland  owing to the number  of spies, and suggest  that  Egypt would be a  better base  for operations.   It  was  presumed, ofcourse, that Mr.  Morgenthau would merely ascertain  whether there was  any possible basis of peace, and not make, offers.                                     EGYPT.    The  late Khedive. [See Eastern Report XVI. p. 6.J Lord Robert Cecil telegraphedon the  24th May [No. 521] to Sir  R. &quot;Wingate saying  that,  if his views coincided withthose of  his predecessor, he (Lord Robert Cecil) suggested that an agreement might be      [898-45]                                 &quot;                         C
 made with the late Khedive on certain  lines, and  that  it should be intimated to  him that this was our last offer; and that, should he refuse it, he must understand that he would not only receive  no allowance, but that it might be found necessary to prevent a hostile pretender, who has throughout been in  close touch with our enemies,, from drawing resources even from  private  estates  in  Egypt.  The terms suggested  by Lord R. Cecil were as.follows :  that (1)  the late  Khedive should publicly recognise  his uncle  as Sultan,  should make a public renunciation of  all  claims to the throne of Egypt, and should undertake never to set foot in Egypt; (2) the  Egyptian Government should  provide him with an income of  2,000Z. a month for life, if  he behaved properly ; (3) the residue of his estate should be formed into a wakf to be held for his  children ; (4)  subject to the same conditions as  in  (2),  that Egypt should  not  object to  his receiving the income of any property which might have been left to him by his mother. Sir  P.  Wingate telegraphed [No. 559]  in reply  on the 27th  May saying  that  he thought the proposed solution probably satisfactory, but before confirming the views of Sir H. McMahon, he should like to discuss the matter with the Sultan, whom he could not see before the 10th  June on account  of his illness.                                  CYRENAICA.     Enemy Submarines. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 17th April in regard to a supposed wireless station at Bomba, and in reference to this Lord R. Cecil telegraphed to him [No. 529] on the 26th May that the  naval commander-in-chief (East Indies  and Egypt)  was  confident  that enemy submarines  were in  communication  with enemy adherents on the coast of Libia, and  that the Admiralty considered that the Italian Government should be urged either to agree to a  joint British-Italian expedition or to undertake one itself.  Sir R. Wingate  replied on the 28th May [No.  562]  that he  did not  know exactly  where the  expedition would operate.    There would  be  a risk if Mohammed Idrisi were not referred to, and  if the enemy base should be  in  territory controlled by Moslems it would be preferable to give  him the option  of destroying it, If this and previous reference to him should be impossible, the best way to dispel  his fear  and suspicion would be to make a frank avowal of the  facts  to his representative. In any case he should deprecate action being taken beyond the scope required to secure the immediate object in view or on imperfect information.                                    ARABIA. Hejaz.     Sir M. Sykes, M. Picot, and King  Hussein -Sir  M. Sykes telegraphed from Aden on the 24th May that he and M. Picot had had an audience with the King on  the 19th at Jeddah ;  it  lasted for three hours, and Faisal  and Fuadd were also present with interpreters.  The King emphasised the necessity for the close co-operation of French and  English  in  the realisation of Arab aspirations, and the incapacity of the Arabs to achieve anything without their united help.  M. Picot read a message from the French President in which reference was made to the Syrian littoral, on which the conversation then turned.  The King repeated that he could not be  a party to any proceedingspurposing to hand over Moslems to  the direct rule of a  non-Moslem  State.   Sir M. Sykes then withdrew for half an hour, and on his return the conversation changed  tothe question of advisers.  The King admitted the  necessity for  European advisers  to heads of departments.   Sir M. Sykes  urged the  essential  importance of such advisers having  executive authority, an idea which  the King naturally  disliked ;  Fuadd said that it would mean the end of Arab independence.   Sir M. Sykes then emphasised.thefact that no really first-class men would act as advisers without an assurance of position and  executive  authority;  which  the King and Fuadd  reluctantly admitted.  The audience ended  most  inconclusively.   M. Picot  was  unfavourably  impressed  bythe King.     On  the following day the King paid a state visit to  the-  flagship,  on  which a meeting took place between the King and those who had been present at the  audience on the previous day, with Colonel  Wilson  in addition.  The King read an answer to the message from the French President, in the course of which he stated that, as he had confidence in Great Britain, he should be content  if the French Government pursued the same policy towards Arab aspirations on the  Syrian littoral  as the British did in Baghdad.  M.  Picot received the  King&apos;s message very well,  and  relations  became cordial.   Faisal gave Sir M. Sykes  a  message from the King  to the effect that they were ready to co-operate to the fullest extent with  France in Syria and with  England
in Mesopotamia, but  they asked for  help  from England with  Idrisi and  Ibn Saud;begging  that  an endeavour  might be made to induce them to recognise the King&apos;position  as leader of the Arab movement, without in any way infringing on  their independence.     The French Military Mission.- Lord. Bertie telegraphed on the 24th May [No. 474]that the French  Government  had replied  in  a lengthy note to the request  for thewithdrawal  of the military  mission  to  Hejaz.   It  laid stress  on the importance toFrance, as a great Moslem Power, of the maintenance of the sovereignty of the King ofHejaz and of the defence of Mecca, but declared its  readiness, if an assurance could begiven them  that  all measures  had been taken  against a Turkish attack on Mecca, toconsider the possibility of reducing its military mission, although the  immediate recallof the whole  did not seem  possible.   En that case it  would  be prepared to recallColonel Bremond (with whom it was very well pleased), whose rank would be too highfor a reduced mission, and  to leave Lieutenant-Colonel Cadi.  It considered that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had been misinformed  as to the sentiments of the members ofthe French mission and as to M. Picots views.   [See Eastern Beport XVI, p. 7.]     Sir R. VVingate telegraphed on the 27th May [No. 560] that he had been informed by the French Minister of the arrival in Cairo of one Cherchali, an Algerian notable, ona mission to Hejaz, where he would support Colonel Bremond in  his dealings with king hussein in  questions concerning French pilgrim interests and  other matters such asmodifications  of the customs regime, the  operations of the Ottoman Bank in Jeddah,and  the prohibition of the  export of  hides matters in which the  interference  of  theFrench  military  mission  had  already  been  deprecated.    Sir  R.  Wingate  was apprehensive  that Oherchalfs  presence might defeat the  object which it was hoped to achieve by the withdrawal of Colonel Bremond&apos;s mission.     The British Mission. In his telegram of the 27th May [No. 560], Sir R. Wingatestrongly recommended that an  alteration should be made in the designation of the british mission without further delay, and that Colonel Wilson should be given the temporaryrank of brigadier-general and be formally appointed chief of this mission.ASIR.     Idrisi and the Italians.  In his telegram [371 A.P.] of the  27th May in regard tothe  Arab confederacy [see below], the Resident at Aden  said that he  considered thatintrigues were going on between Idrisi and the  Italians, but that Idrisi put us beforethem, though  he did not refuse what  he could get from them : our command of the seagave us  considerable control  over him.  [In  regard  to this it is worth noting that ina  recent telegram Sir  R. Rodd said that  in  reply to a casual  question  the ItalianColonial Minister had told him that he had not  heard anything of  Idrisi for somemonths past.]     In a telegram also  relating to the Arab confederacy and dated the 26th May [see below]  the  Viceroy expressed a  hope on  behalf of his Government  that the mereapprehension  of  Italian  intervention would  not again be allowed to  force us into  aquestionable undertaking,  and  asked  whether, to obviate similar apprehensions in  thefuture,  an understanding could not  be arrived at with  the Italian  Government inrespect of southern Arabia.YEMEN.   &quot;  Arab  Confederacy.   [See Eastern Report XVI,  p.  7,  and  XVII,  p.  4]. Mr.  Chamberlain  telegraphed  to the Viceroy  on the 25th  May  (the  telegram  beingrepeated to Aden) that  the Resident at  Aden might  proceed as he proposed in his telegram of the 18th May, but he should make  it clear, in  promising general support,that military co-operation from Aden  was not intended.   For the  purpose  of ejectingthe Turks from Yemen, help in arms and money might be promised, no reference beingmade to the Imam.     On the 26th May the Viceroy telegraphed that the Indian Governments experienceof southern Arabs made it still  doubtful as to the sincerity of the declared first objective of the confederacy-^-the ousting of the Turks.   It had sounded  a note of warning inregard to the  Imam, whose only fault had been that, while remaining neutral towardsourselves, he had refused to break faith with the Turks.   His Government recognisedthat the Resident must be the best judge of the value and sincerity of the confederacy,but  it  thought  that  all  possible consequences  should be considered before  using       [898-45]              . .                                          D
such a questionable catspaw.  He repeated the arguments and suggestions contained inhis telegram of the 17th May [Eastern Report XVII, p. 4].     The Resident telegraphed on the  27th May (&quot;371 A.P.] that  so far as  he couldlearn nearly all the most influential Arabs in Yemen were behind the  confederacy, andthe Abdulla Sultan, heretofore a pronounced supporter of the  Imam, was in favour of supporting  it.   The  Resident was  quite aware of idrisis  ambition  and personalhostility to the Imam ;  Idrisi, though cognisant of the scheme, did not know who wasthe Imam designate the confederacy desired him to be of the Imamic family.  Thoughthe present Imam  had  been  neutral,  in  regard to Turkey it had been, possiblyunavoidably, a benevolent neutrality.  The confederacy  was at  present  pronouncedlypro-British ; it might become pro-Italian.                                     PERSIA.     Resignation of the Cabinet. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 28th May [No. 188]that the Cabinet had resigned on the previous day.     Anti-British Feeling. Sir C.  Marling telegraphed on the 24th  May TNo. 184]reporting the assassination of the  editor  of a newspaper subventioned by him. . Theinstigators of the crime, which was undoubtedly political, were those who, last February,murdered another of our friends.  There was but little chance of the actual  murderersin the latter case being punished, though, being under arrest for another murder, theyhad confessed their guilt.   The Ministers said that the actual assassins were anarchistsfrom Russia, of whom numbers were  known  to have come to Persia ; but the crimeswere arranged by a secret committee in the  pay of Shoa-es-Sultaneh,  Haji Moin-ut-Tujjar, and the democrat leaders.  The Prime Minister had declared that he was readyto  execute  the  assassins  and arrest the political leaders, but should he do&apos;so he. wouldbe  at once dismissed by the Shah.  Ministers known to be favourable to us considered&quot;that their lives were threatened.:&apos;.                                    INDIA.     The Mahsuds. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 24th May that the following hadbeen received from the  political  agent at Wano.  Pie had on the 20th May  discussed the situation with the leading Wano Wazir maliks of all sections ; they had assured him of their loyalty to the British Government, but bad stated that our present weakness waseverywhere realised, and had advised a display of force to counteract the arguments ofMullah Hamzul,  who had tried to set up  a jehad, pointing out that the Governmenthad taken no action against the tribe in spite of its repeated serious outrages, which hadinvolved the death of many British officers and sepoys, and the loss of hundreds of rifles.Mullah Hamzul had boasted that no more  convoys would be allowed to travel through,Gomal, and had also told them that the Government was anxious to abandon the agency,but could not do  so on account  of the  impossibility of removing the garrison.  He hadinduced a few Toji Khel and Shikaiwal Waziris to make a demonstration against WanaTaksil but,  thanks to the. general loyalty of the Waziris, this had failed.ADDENDA.                                     RUSSIA.     The Workmen&apos;&apos;fs Council. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 784] on the 28th May&quot;that he had received a communication from  M. Terestchenko informing him that theexecutive committee of the Workmen&apos;s Council had telegraphed an invitation to visit the Council to the following English parties : (1) Labour party, (2) Independent Labourparty, (3) British Socialist  party, (4) Fabian Society.   M. Terestchenko hoped that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would assist the proposed visit.     Sir G. Buchanan and the  Socialist Ministers [see p. 2-1 On the 30th May LordR. Cecil telegraphed [No.  L099] to Sir G. Buchanan -saying  that  his  Excellency had spoken and acted with great courage and discretion imdifficult circumstances, and thathe desired to express his warm approval of his Excellency&apos;s action..     The British Note [see p. 2]. From a telegram [No.  979]  sent to  Sir R. Rodd onthe  30th  May by Lord R.  Cecil, it appears that the suggested amendment  of the sentence &quot; In a final peace,&quot; &amp;c, was made.
 /                                  POLAND.     Intentions of the Central Powers. On the 28th May Sir H. Rumbold transmitted [No. 421]  a  message from Lord Acton to the effect that he had been informed by the papal agent,  who was long at Munich, that he  understood that the question of Poland no longer  created any difficulty between Vienna and Berlin, post bellum independence having been  decided upon ; the autonomy of Galicia formed the preliminary step to its incorporation and  the  counterpart  to  the autonomy  of Bussian Poland.  Central Powers anticipated opposition of the  Allies to the exclusion of Posen.                                     ARABIA. HEJAZ.     The French Military  Mission. On  the 29th  May,  Lord  B. Cecil telegraphed [No. 544] to  Sir R. Wingate informing him that he had received the reply of the French Government  to his request  for the withdrawal of the Bremond mission, and giving a summary of the French note.  The chief points in this have already been noted [p.  7], but there are two or three not  included in  Lord Bertie&apos;s  summary:  (1.) The  French Government  says that the  mission was originally sent to Hejaz at our request.  [As  to this see Arabian Report  N.S. IV,  p. 1  ; V,  p.  3;  VI,  p, 2;  VII, p. 2.]   (2.)  The withdrawal depends on England giving a  formal undertaking to protect Mecca against a Turkish offensive.  (3.) The note recapitulates the principle of equality established by the Sykes-Picot  agreement  and states that while the French Government is prepared to admit that the geographical position of Arabia creates a  &quot; peculiar situation in favour of Great Britain&quot;  and while  it is determined to  abstain from ali interference in the internal affairs of the peninsula,  it can neither disinterest  itself in the independence  of King Hussein nor allow  either the  consequences which result from that  principle to be placed in question or any  Christian  Power  to exercise  a  preponderating or privileged influence at Mecca.     On  the  same  day Lord R. Cecil sent  a  telegram  to Sir R. Wingate [No. 540]  in regard to Mustapha Chercbali saying that the French Government had communicated the substance of his instructions.  The settlement of questions affecting Moslem French pilgrims was said to be the main  object of his mission, but  certain general political instructions had been added  for his guidance.     As  regards  the pilgrimage question Cherchali was: instructed  to complete the purchase  of the  pilgrims&apos;  hostel, and  to  place  it  in  the charge of the  Habou administration since the  French Government could not itself own property in Mecca ; he was also to  prepare for and supervise  the forthcoming French pilgrimage and to examine the questions of dues,  fees, exchange, &amp;c.     The general  instructions were of much greater importance and  raised  the whole question of Franco-British relations in Arabia.     He  was instructed not to initiate  political  discussion,  but should  the Mecca Government  enquire as  to  his views in  regard  to Syria  he was to remove  the impression which had grown up in Arabia that France had disinterested herself or, on the other hand, that she was opposed to  the designs of  King Hussein for expansion  in that region, and he was to intimate the general  tenour  of the Asia Minor  agreement without  actually divulging  its  terms.  The text of  the  instructions bearing on  this point  contains the following passage : &quot; While feeling that  no Power  should obtain either new territory or  political  prestige  in Arabia,  the  French Government recognises that the proximity of Egypt and the  Persian Gulf creates  a situation in favour of the commercial interests of its  English  Allies  which  you  should  bear  in mind.  I feel therefore that,  whenever questions of this nature are  raised, you - should reserve  your opinion pending the receipt of  instructions for  which you  should  ask, either from the Quai d&apos;Orsay or from  our  Minister  at  Cairo, and which will be concerted with the British Government.&quot;     The instructions then proceeded to  deal with Syria  in the general, sense noted above, and mention incidentally that it is the intention  of the French Government to provide capital for the  exploitation  of the  country,  to encourage the  nomination  of Emirs at Aleppo, Damascus, Mosul, &amp;c, and  itself to appoint technical advisers to thoseEmirs.  They continued :  .         &quot; On the  sea  coast, where the  population is more mixed, it will be essential     to establish a special regime under the direct  aagis of the French Government.         &quot; As regards Jerusalem and Palestine a modus vivendi, having as its object     the respect of all religions, will be discussed, and the  King of Hejaz will be admitted     to this discussion.&quot;
r-RINTKD AT THE FOKEIGK OTFIOB BT C. K. HARBISON.-1/6/1917.    The instructions then examined the question of the establishment  of  a  Franco^British  bank at Jeddah, and the King of Hejaz was to be urged to revoke his refusal to permit the reopening of a branch of the Ottoman Bank, which must have been dueto a &quot; misunderstanding,&quot; and to be  informed of the &quot; painful impression &quot; which thatrefusal had made on the &quot; French and British Governments.&quot;    It  was clear that the French now desired to limit their recognition of our special position in Arabia to an admission of our preponderant commercial interests.    Lord B. Cecil  added that  he was informing the  French Ambassador that a fullreply would be sent in due course, but that in regard to the Ottoman  Bank the BritishGovernment was still of opinion that the opening of a bank in Hejaz  was undesirable ;that as  King Hussein&apos;s attitude  had  been  perfectly justifiable, it  could not  allowitself to be associated with Cherchalfs  representations ; and that in any  case it wouldbe unwilling to support the claim of the  Imperial Ottoman Bank to trade in Hejaz, in whatever form  that  bank might  be constituted.  And, finally, Sir  R. Wingate was instructed  to  inform  Colonel  Wilson  how matters  stood,  that he  might  preventCherchali creating-  misconceptions  in  regard to the  Ottoman  Bank  in  the mind  of king Hussein.YEMEN.    Arab  Confederacy  [see  p. 7]. The Resident  at Aden  telegraphed  on the28th May [373 A.P.], in continuation of his telegram of the 27th May [371 A.P.], andwith reference  to that  of the Viceroy of the 26th May [655 S.]. He said that due consideration had been given to the possibility of Idrisi being  behind the movement;he (the Resident) thought that if the  confederacy should succeed with our  assistance we should be able to.check possible  Idrisi aspirations  and Italian intrigues, but should it succeed without our help our position would be difficult it  would be better  for theconfederacy to look to. ns than to Idrisi and through him to the Italians.                                    PERSIA.    Bakhtiari  Levies. On the 30th May  Lord  R.  Cecil telegraphed [No.  154]  toSir C. Marling expressing his concurrence in the temporary postponement of the schemefor these levies.
