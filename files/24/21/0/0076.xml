                         WAR CABINET.                   THE   SITUATION   IN   TURKEY              No.  1.        Memorandum by C:,ptain  The Hon:  Aubrey Herbert,  M.P.                      (Scheme  attached).     On  July  20th I had a leng  conversation with a Turk whom I had knownbefore.  He comes from one  of the best  and  most honourable families of his Icountry; in looks he  is like a  typical  Englishman of the public schoolclass and he  talks perfect  English.  He  arranged the meeting with elaborate \secrecy.  His &quot;homme  de confiance&quot; came to  my hotel at half-past six inthe  morning and  told  me where I would find  a motor car that would take meto an empty house.     When I met  my acquaintance,  I told him that I was in Switzerland formy health but I  was anxious to  take  the opportunity of speaking to him andto other Turks about  conditions of our  prisoners In Turkey.  I was notauthorised to discuss this  or any other question and any opinion that Imight express would be mine and mine only.   He said that he understood,that he  was in the same position but that his risk was much greater thanmine; he was  detested in  Berlin as an Anglophile and, if it was known thathe had met an Englishman, the consequences  for him would be very serious,although he was  powerfully  protected.   He said that in his opinion the Turkish  Government as it  is constituted  to-day  would not make terms. They arestrong,  unscrupulous  men, but they are  not  unpatriotic,  at least from theirown  point of  view.  None  of the big  men can be bought, but a number oflesser folk are  open  to bribes.  The Turkish Government do not believe inan overwhelming  German victory, but  they think that the  peace terms willbe satisfactory  from  the  Ottoman point  of view. The Turks hold that theyare  fighting  a defensive  war. The gift  of Constantinople to Russia unitedall  parties.   More recent  speeches  by  leading British statesmen f the late and  the present Governments confirmed them in........... I                                                                theirEjj RET. T. 1575.
 their  determination to fight.   It would he folly, he said, for  any Turkish Government to ask for peace on the terms that the  Allies proposed.  He said that he realised that these speeches were made for consumption in England, hut that they naturally produced the result in Turkey of making the peo- ple  ready to fight to the death.  He did not mention any special treaty arrangements &quot;but he referred generally to the partition of Turkey.  He said that for the last year he had devoted himself to organising an Anglophile party to bring Turkey and England together after the war.  This party was now  very strong and with help they oould effect a change of Government.  He believed that this could be done within twomonths&apos; time though he would not pledge himself to a week or a day.  I-ioney and guarantees were needed.   The money wouldnot  amount to much in view of the purpose to be achieved;the  guarantees he thought were more difficult.  He said thatthe  autonomy of the outlying provinces,  Armenia,  Arabia,Keeopotamia, Syria and Palestine,  was acceptable to hisfriends and part of their programme.   He said that hebelieved that even the present Government would find noinsuperable objection to this scheme.  (Four years agoTalaat Pasha sketched such a plan to  me).   I asked himwhat was meant by autonomy?  Bid it mean occupation?  He said that it did nean certainly the Turkish flag,  and,  hethought,  garrisons.  I answered that, if the occupationwas  effective, it would mean that  there  was no realautonomy for which we were fighting and  that weak  garrioonawould be an irritation to the native  populations,  and asource of anxiety,  and possibly of humiliation to  theTurkish Government.  He said that  he  was inclined  toagree with reservations,  but  that  ho  would find it very                           owndifficult to put this to his/people who  wewild   accusehim  of working for England and not for his own country.He suggested that the Egyptian status quo  ante might  be  a                                           Satisfactory
 satisfactory compromise,.  H* said that the men  of hie  party were honourable and patriotic and that they were not going to  turn out the preeent government for the sake of  the Allies who would then proceed to partition Torkey.  He said (his own words) that they were utterly fed up with  the War, but not to the point of selling their country,  I repeated again that I represented na one but myself but  that I  should like to put a question to him:  when guarantees were given,. they were also asked for: there were two sides  to every con** tract:  supposing that hie eug^jestione were put  forward officially or semi-offi c ially, what guarantees  would his people  be prepared to give?  He answered that-my question put him in. a difficult position: he had no authority to com- munioate the. strength of the. Anglophile party or the names of the men who compo8e.d-.it:. he lamented what&apos;had taken place  in Armenia and realised that we, ehould need effective  guarantees against a repetition of such horrors..  He said  that,.unless Turkey  was, to be the. vassal of Germany,.English help was essential for her and that what he and his people desired  was the assistance and direction of Englishmen.  He repeated that his party was strong,  but that it needed moral and  financial backing.   He had worked in this direction for a year but he was getting very tired and unless hope was1 held out he  meant to abandon his work,   if .1 wanted to be  put into communica* tion.wi.th one. of the  biggest men,  he would eee that it  was done,   I  answered, that I  did not think I  could prolong ray stay,   HC said that, a scheme was at the  present moment  being drawn up which he would let me see.  . (ftttached).     After talking to three important  and well-informed Turks and some  Englishmen who are in close contact with all  shadesof ottomah opinion, I  venture to add the  following observations     The  impression  the  Turkish Government has created is that                                                         ths
 the  German  submarine will  starve us on the  sea,  that FalliOn- hayn will redeem his promise, retake Bagdad and  force us to retreat  at  Gaza, when he will turn his attention to the Sing of the Hedj&amp;z, who by that time will be ready  enough to make peace.   The Turks have been  expecting a second revolution in Russia;  the Anglophile Turks believe that air real opport- unity of making peace was when we had taken Bagdad.  If we had  offered terms then^ they would have been taken.  Wow Talast, who is ouppoaet to be genuinely in  favour of peace* though of course at the most advantageous moment, may think it inadvisable to negotiate before Falkenhayn  has had his chance in the autumn campaign.      The Arab Committees are said to be growing in the armybut  they do not carry sufficient guns against  the Turks.There is, of course, much misery and starvation, but it mustbo remembered that in the last resort the Turks  will take allthat?  the Christians have,  f do not think that the Turks haveany  fear of the Germans and Aust ians in Turkey.  There arevery  few of them and the Germans are most unpopular, but theTurka are unquestionably very much afraid of the Bulgarians.The  Bulgarian army has not fceen touched in this war.  I donot know in what  condition are the defenoea of Tchataldja,but  it would certainly be to the German interests to seethat  those fortifications should be weak.      AB long as the Turks believe that the outlying provincesauch  as Syria and also parts of Turkey proper are to be an-noxed by foreigners who will make these regions the instru-ments of further encroachment,  there can be no prospect ofpeace.  If,  on the other hand,  the Turks see a chance of thematerialization of the hope which is very  dear to them,  thattheir country will b^ringed round by a &quot;chain of senti-auton-omous friendly Moslem States, half the reason that  compelledthem  to continue fighting will  have gone.They
  They realise  (1)  That thoir past policy has hern unsuccessful:   they       have lost Tripoli,  Macedonia,  otc.,:  at the same tine       they realise  that wo  also have made mistakes:  (2)  They realise  that now America is in with ue, though       wo may not win completely, we canndt he beaten:  (3)  Their man-power is failing, ours ie growing:  (4)  They see the  danger to their country if Austria or       Bulgaria comes to separate torm3i this is one of their       cogent arguments in favour of a separate peace. They       arc very anxious to come to an understanding before       tho autumn campaign complicates tho situation.  It seems to me that we have the following alternativesbefore us:-  (1)  tfe may, if we choose, do nothing, because everything       is difficult to do and wait with some apprehension for       the autumn campaign:  (2)  We may talk to the Turkish Government;  this is very       doubtful and dangerous:  (3)  We may talk to the opposition and this certainly has       possibilities for us:  (4)  Wo may insist upon controlling thii Situation and 4e-       manding from our Allies a parity of sacrifice. Russia       has givon up Constantinople; we do not propose ts an-       nex Mesopotamia and wo arc in a position to ask the       French and the Italians to surrender claims to torri-       tories which they cannot take themselves, and which.      . it is doubtful whether thoy could, hold evem Xt we       oould take them for them.  If Turkoy makes a separate       poaoo, v/o free tonnage, wo liberate arnioe, we render       tho position of Austria and Bulgaria infinitely more       precarious, but to.-achieve this soAothlng in the na-       turo of a roStatoment of our aims in Turkoy and Asia       Minor is essential.  This might be done privatoly, if       it is impossible to do it publicly.  If America oould       be brought to oonour in this notion her help would bo       very valuable.Paris,   July 25,  1917.
No.2.

Yesterday,July 21st, I was sitting in the Kursaal at Interlaken when Dr. Parodi, in company with two Turkish friends, came to neighbouring table. He introduced me to his two friends who were Hakki Halid Bey, ex-Director sf the Mint at Constantinople, now living at Geneva, and Dr. Noureddin Bey, an influential member of the C. U. P. and director of a Hopital at Constantinople. Dr. Noureddin has been in Switzerland for about a fortnight, and was sent here by the Committee. We began talking about British prisoners in Turkey whose condition, I said, caused grave anxiety in England.

Dr. Noureddin reassured me and told that throughout the war there had been an order to treat the English prisoners with special care. This had been done where it was possible. We then went walking in the garden which was completely deserted. Dr. Parodi at first talked to Noureddin Bey while I walked with Hakki Halid. The following is a précis of our conversations. I told both the Turks that I represented no one but myself, that I was not authorised to communicate with them and that any opinion I might express would be my own. Both the Turks told me the same story.

These two gentlemen came from a conference at Zurich. There were present at this conference Fuad Salim Boy,  Ottoman Minister in Switzerland, Halid Bey, the Albanian Military Attaché, Fethi Bey, Turkish Minister in Sofia, and other influential Turks, including convalescent officers from Davos, who are friends of Talaat.     The conference decided that the present policy of Enver is disastrous and that immediate steps should be taken to defeat and bring about an Anglo-Turkish understanding. There are, they said, two parties in the Committee, one composed of Enver&apos;s man, while the others were waiting for                                                     /Talaat
 Talant  to  lead  them.     Talaat was hanging &quot;back, waiting for his  position to become more assured with regard to foreign politios and in the army, where he is oreating a great fol- 1 owing.  V/ehib Pash3, who was in command of the Army of the Caucasus, had made no secret of his hatred of the Germans who  had tried to conciliate him by taking him round the Wes- tern front.  Ee had, however, returned to Turkey oonfirmed in his dislike of the Germans and declaring that Turkey could hold out longer than Austria.  Rahmi Pasha of Smyrna and Dijemal Pasha are both of them against Bnver: Ealil Pasha in Mesopotamia refused to carry out the orders of Palkenhayn, but, as he is 2nver&apos;s uncle, his position is not clear.  The Anglophile party are afraid of two things; they fear to create a revolution that may be disastrous to themselves and to their country,  in other words,  they are afraid of the guillo- tine and of the partition of Turkey.    They want moral and financial support from England and guarantees that there will be no complete partition amongst the  Powers of Turkey.  Hakki Halid ana. Dr. Koureddin asked me if I had any idea as to the terms upon which Great Britain would  be prepared to make a separate peace ^^ith Turkey.   I answered that I did not knowwhat terms the  British Government would desire and that I wasnot authorised to discuss this  question.    Hakki Halid said that they did not wish to negotiate with the Italians or theRussians ana that they preferred to negotiate with us rather than with the French.    The  essential importance of the subse- quent conversation was their desire to substitute an Anglo-phile for Enver Pasha (probably Wahib kasha) and to enter into direct relations  with Great  Britain.   Naturally,  we didnot discuss the method by which  this  substitution was  to be effected.     They proposed (and this proposal emanated from the  Confer- enoe and possibly indirectly from Talaat)  that Noureadin Bey                                               should
 should return to Turkey where he would see Talaat.  Talaat would then appoint an authoritative person with credentials who would journey to Switzerland on the ground of ill-health accompanied by Pr. Noureddin as his physician.   (Dr. Eour- eddin told Dr. Parodi that,  if the British Legation thought it desirable,  it would be possible for him to convey with perfect secrecy any communication to Talaat; the means that he suggested were an official bag that he would receive from Puad Selim,  the Turkish Minister1.  On- arriving in Switzer- land this envoy would enter  into direct relations with the British Government.     Both Dr.  Psrodi and I believe that these suggestions were made in good faith by Dr.  Noureddin whose life was saved in the revolution by the Whittalls and who is a sincere Anglo-phile.   V/e also think     the evidence points to his havingbeen sent by Talaat  as directly he arrived here in Switzer-land Eakki Ealid Bey communicated to Dr..  Parodi Joureddinrsdesire  to see  him, and,  if possible,  some influentialEnglishman.Berne,  July 28,  1917.
