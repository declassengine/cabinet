26th. July, 1917.

Memorandum on 

The Coal Mines Control Agreement.

Under the Defence of the Realm Act the Board of Trade took possession of all the Coal Mines in South Wales and Monmouthshire on 1st December 1916 and this action was extended to all the remaining Coal Mines in Great Britain and Ireland on 1st March 1917.

The objects which it is sought to attain by this action were as follows:-

(1) To Control the whole production and distribution of Coal in the National Interest, and

(2) To remove the chief cause of labour unrest by making it possible for the men to feel that they are working for the community and not to earn excessive profits for the Owners.

The Agreement scheduled to the Bill is necessary for both purposes in that:-

(1) By pooling, so far as practicable, the profits of the industry it gives the Controller a free hand:-

(a) to adjust production and distribution to the altered conditions arising from the War, and

(b) To economise transport, ensure essential supplies and regulate prices and consumption.

(2) It limits closely the excess which any Coalowner may retain over his pre-war earnings, and removes from the industry any suspicion of "profiteering".

Following on the order of Control after submitting the outline of his Scheme to the War Cabinet the Controller of Coal Mines took steps to arrive at an agreement with the Coal Owners for the limitation of their Profits and for compensation in respect of any action arising out of Control. On the suggestion of the Controller the Executive Council of the Mining Association of Great Britain appointed a Consultative Committee for this purpose and negotiations between the Controller and this Committee have extended over four months. The resulting provisional Agreement was submitted to and approved by the War Cabinet, and was thereafter adopted by the

(see over)

 


Executive Council of the Mining Association of Great Britain. This Agreement is attached as a Schedule to the Coal Mines Agreement (Confirmation) Bill 1917, and is in full and complete settlement of all claims which have arisen or may arise by reason of actions taken or to be taken by the Controller under the powers conferred on him.

The manner in which this Agreement provides for the objects of Control may be summarised thus:-

(1) The limitation of Profits accruing to those Owners who are benefitting by War conditions or may benefit by the Distribution Scheme.

(2) The compensation of these Owners where profits may fall below the pre-War standard by reason of War conditions not common to the whole Industry or by reason of the action of the Controller.

Although it is not possible to forecast the financial results of the Scheme it is anticipated that the additional Excess Profits Duty according to the State will at least equal payments made in compensation to Owners.

1. Limitation of Profits.

The Profits retainable by Mine Owners are limited to the average amount earned in the pre-War periods which form the basis for the Profits Standard under the Finance Act 1915 (or which might have been earned if the Colliery had been worked in that period under the same conditions, excluding those due to the War, as during the period of Control), together with 5% of the Profits earned in excess of this Standard amount; 80% of this excess goes to the Inland Revenue under the Finance Act 1917 and the remaining 15% known as "Coal Mines Excess Payments" is to be collected by the Inland Revenue and paid to the Controller of Coal Mines. In the case of a Colliery earning less than its Percentage standard under the Finance Act the whole 95% of the excess over the Profits Standard will be paid to the Controller; the maximum profits which any Owner can retain under the provisions of the Agreement are limited to the


Profits Standard plus one-fifth thereof, and provision is made that all profits earned by the Owner up to the Standard to which he is entitled may be retained by him.

The contributions which accrue to the Controller in respect of the extra 15% of the Excess Profits will be collected by the Inland Revenue Authorities under the powers and subject to all the rights and privileges conferred by the Finance Acts and this provision will enable the Controller to manage with a very materially reduced organisation and staff compared with what would have been necessary if these contributions had to be collected by his Department. On the other hand in order to carry out this policy the Agreement has been somewhat complicated by the necessity of defining the duties of the Inland Revenue in this respect as an addition to those which they would perform in connection with the assessment and collection of Excess Proftis Duty under the Finance Acts. Coal Owners will not be required in ordinary cases to prepare separate returns for the purpose of determining their liability to the Controller under the Agreement, a very important matter to them with their depleted staffs, and on the other hand the whole of the files of the Inland Revenue Authorities are made available to the Controller and will much reduce the information which he will have to obtain independently from the Coal Owners.

II. Compensation.

While in the year 1916 Coal Owners generally benefitted materially from the War, during the current year shortage of shipping, wagon and locomotive power and the increasing shortage of labour are operating adversely with the result that in some districts, and particularly those most affected by the restriction of exports, Collieries are earning not only much less than they earned in 1916 but even less than

(see over)


they earned in the pre-war period. In other districts where the interference has been less earnings are still considerably in excess of the pre-war results.

The Controller by the action which he has taken or may take has of necessity interfered and may still more intervene with the distribution of coal, the allotting of labour is generally in the management of the Collieries affecting some owners more than others and leading possibly to a material reduction in earnings. To remedy this inequality the Coal Mines Excess Payments contributed by the more successful Collerier will be applied to compensate Owners for any interference with business due to war conditions not common to the whole industry or to the action of the Controller resulting in reduction of profits below the pre-war-standard. This compensation takes the form of a modified guarantee of the pre-war standard of profits if not earned the modification being effected by reducing the pre-War standard by 75% of the reduction in output until the latter is reduced below 65% of the pre-War output when each case has to be considered on merits. As an illustration a Colliery pre-War output was 10,000 tons and profit on this output £1000. The output is reduced to 9000 tons, but the Owner will be paid as if his output had been 9.25 tons.

If the reduction of output is more than 35% of the pre-War output special consideration is given and if it is due to any action of the Controller the further reduction of the Profits Standand below that point is to be based on a percentage less than three-fourths of the percentage reduction in output. If the reduction is not due to the action of the Controller but only to general causes the reduction in the Profits Standard will be greater than three-fourths of the equivalent percentage reduction in output. In all such case the Controller will fix a substitute for the Profits Standard 
and an appeal is allowed to the Board of Referees appointed under the Finance Act. 

It is anticipated as already stated that the payments made in respect of this modified guarantee will not exceed the coal Mines Excess Payments collected by the Controller. Conditions, however, may so develop by reason of causes due to the ? that the total payments by the Controller may exceed his receipts. The Controller has power to meet this condition either by raising the selling price of coal, or by terminating the Agreement and entering into a fresh one or by drafts on the Exchequer. It may also be necessary in the interests of the State to make advances to Owners before collections of Coal Mines Excess Payments to a sufficient amount to cover their advances have been made by the Inland Revenue.

III. Cases of Hardship.

The Agreement contains various provisions to deal with those cases in which the conditions of working the Colleries apart altogether from War conditions differ materially during the period of Control from those which prevailed in the Standard period. The Excess Profits Duty clauses of the Finance Act provide for a Percentage Standard on the capital employed in all cased in which the profits in the pre-War period have been less thatn such Percentage Standard. Thus an Undertaking which has never in the whole of its history earned profits equal to the Percentage Standard and which may have no prospects of ever earning any such sum is allowed this Percentage Standard equally with the concern which through Special misfortunes in the pre-War Year has earned profits in that period below its fair average earning capacity. In the Agreement the Percentage Standard is excluded but in order to meet cases where it is clear that the Profits Standard is not a fair one power is given by clause 8 or the Agreement to fix a sub-

(see over)
stitute for the Profits Standard which will take into consideration the adverse conditions in which the Colliery was working during the Standard period. If the Controller declines to fix a substitute for the Profits Standard or fixes an amount which is not satisfactory to the Owner, the latter is entitled in either case to appeal to the Board of Referees. This substitute for the Profits Standard so fixed then becomes for all practical purposes the Standard respect of both the amount of Profits which the Owner is entitled to retain and the amount which he is entitled to have made up under the modified Guarantee.

In the event that the Controller finds it necessary to close down a Colliery the modified Guarantee remains in force but the Owner has no other claim on the Controller for any loss or damage he may suffer by reason of the closing. Provision is however made in the Agreement for a Levy at the option of each Coal Mining District to provide a fund to be administered by the Controller jointly with the Association of that District out of which such losses or damages can be met. The Levy will be met out of the retainable profits of the Owner and will not be treated as an expense of carrying on the Undertaking. At the end of the period of Control the Controller will repay to any Association which has added the Levy Clause a sum not exceeding 40% of any claims that may have been met out of the Levy but only so far as any ? plus funds remaining in his hands permit.

IV Averaging of Profits

(1) Recoveries of Excess Profits Duty paid in previous years are to be treated as Income of the year which they are recovered or the purpose of determining whether any payments are due to the Owner in respect of the Guarantee Standard.
(2) The Surplus Profits in excess of the Profits Standard retained by the Owner in any year are to be set off against deficits in any other period during Control with the exception that recoveries of Excess Profits Duty in any year are only to be brought into the earnings of the period of Control to the extent to which they are required in the year in which they are received to make good any deficit in the Profits Standard.

V. Closing Mines.

If an Owner wishes to close his Mine and the Controller refuses his permission the Owner, in addition to his other rights under the Agreement. Is to be entitled to receive the Amount of any loses which he may incur by reason of this refusal. 

VI. Arbitration.

Any dispute arising out of the Agreement and not specifically excluded or provided for by a reference to the Board of Referees is to be submitted to Arbitration.
