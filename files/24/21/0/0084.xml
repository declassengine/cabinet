P.   OPERATIONS *                             SECRETProm :- General Barter,To :-   CL&amp;.S-.                             51.7.17.                                             1.32 a.m.1167,   I returned here today.   I interviewed Aiexeieff,who is leaving tonight.  I asked him to represent in afriendly way t* Kerenski that immediate restoration tomilitary authorities of disciplinary powers was the onlyhope of saving the situation.  I intimated that Russia&apos;sappeal for energetic co-operation on the French frontcould not be expected to meet with a sympathetic responseinvolving infinite sacrifices, if, on its sido, the RussianGovernment was not prepared in this grave crisis, to putmilitary considerations &quot;before political expediency.  Ipointed out that such a measure as that introduced byKerenski, of forming field courts-martial of 3 officersand 3 men for trial of most serious cases of offencescommitted before the enemy, was most pernicious, andutterly incompatible with thr restoration of discipline.        Alex^ieff is not going to Petrograd, but Yfillwrite immediately tc Kerenski.        The Chief of the French Military Mission is now inFetrograd, making representations in the same sense toRus s ian Government.        Aiexeieff:s view is that severs pressure on the partof the Allies could alone induce the Government to restoredisciplinary powers tc the military authorities, and wouldprovide Kerenski with the necessary lever to procure the assentof the- Petrograd Committee, without which he is powerless -to act.  He even stated that stern demand by the Powers forImmediate restoration of the discipline prevailing amongall the other allied armies would be the most friendlyservice they could&apos;bestow en Russia.        Conference yesterday, at which Tereschenko assisted,appears to have been of short duration and the generals weremerely asked tc give their views as to the measures necessaryto restore tho efficiency of the Army.  Question of militaryoperations was not touched upon.   Except Brusiloff, who saton the fence, all the generals emphatically demanded abolitionof committees and commissary at the front and the restorationto military chiefs of full - disciplinary powers.                            r        Kerenski expressed the opinion that disciplinarymeasures could only be adopted by degrees, in order not tocreate discontent in the ranks.   The Ministers returned toPetrograd without arriving at any practical result.
