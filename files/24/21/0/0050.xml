29th July 1917O ^V T  W        Present Military Situation in Russia and    ,  Oyf/Wj    its  Effect  on Our Future Plans.   1.   I prepared a Papor on this subject on the 9thMay last and I invite the attention of the War Cabinetto it, although it is naturally a little out-of-datein the way of details.   2.   I may remind the War Cabinet at once that thereis no good reason for the Russian retirement other vhantheir refusal to fight *   The Germans had made nopreparations for a great offensive, and in fact seem tohave been considorably alarmed at the successful resultof the Russian offensive which commenced on the 1st July,since which date they have sent from the Ytest to the EastFront no fewer than six divisions.   These must have beenordered in the first instanoo for defensive purposes.The Germans merely made a counter-attack as the usual andbest means of stopping the Russian offensive, and then,probably to their surprise, the Russians broke, with thoresult that three Russian armies comprising some 60 to 70divisions, well equipped with guns and ammunition,  are nowrunning away from some 18 Austrian and German divisions.The real reason for the Russian debaole is of course thechaotic state of the Government and the country.   TheGermans have so far mado no specific claim to the captureof cither prisoners or guns, and I am inclined to thinkthat not many have been taken,   With the exception t)i54 4.5&quot; howitzers none of the guns we have given to theRussians were with the three armies which have retreated.There- were, however, twentyfour 8&quot; and twelve 12&quot; howitzersof English mako with these armies.
                     2.       3.   The Russians have retired on a front of about140 miles (see attached map), and it is their allegedintention to retire to previously prepared positions anthe line Zbaraz - Grigmalow - Eusiatyn - Sniatyn -WishnitZ; which means abandoning the salient betweenTarnopol and the Roumanian frontier, and giving upnearly all the ground gained since Brussiloff&apos;s offensivein June 1916,    If the Russians succeed in holding thenew line just mentioned no very serious military resultswill follow from their retreat, and they ought to be ableto hold it if they wish to do so.     As I have said, theGermans had made no preparations fcr a great and sustained:offensive; their railway communications on this part ofthe front are not good; and there is a break of gaugeon the frontier.   In 1915 the Germans made extensivepreliminary preparations for a rapid change of gaugeof the Russian railways, and were thus able to carry itout quickly when they entered Russian territory; theymade, no such preparations on this occasion so far as weknow.   On the whole we ought not to jump tc tho con-clusion that Russia is out of the war for good and all. She may yet cause Germany a good deal of trouble andanxiety.   Further, we should not forget that Germany,too, has her difficulties.   The economic situation isbad; there will be great disappointment at--, the war notending this year; Austria is in a bad way; and we mayhope shortly to give on the West front a useful replyto Germany1 s advance---ac roes /the Russian front.
    4.   It is not, however, possible to rely upon the Russiansholding the new line, especially as the enemy can probablyafford to transfer further divisions from the Northern andWestern Russian fronts, where the Russian offensive has brokendown and where the troops are no less demoralised than thosefurther south.  Moreover, if the enemy intends to exploit hissuccesses and to &quot;get Roumania, if not Russia herself, out ofthe war he will, if allowed to do so, move more divisions fromFrance to the Eastern Front. If this is done, and if theRussians fall to hold the new line, the consequences might beserious, because the enemy would in that case threaten theright flank of the Roumanian Army which would be compelled tofall back behind the Sereth. If the Russians lose Czernovitz,the enemy will probably be able tc turn the line of the Serethand compel the Roumanian Army to retire behind the Pruth, thusabandoning Roumania altogether, and he might even be able toturn this line as well.  If forced to abandon their countryit is possible that the Roumanians would make an independentpeace.    5,   The most effective method of averting this and afurther Russian collapse is to continue to bring the utmostpressure to bear on the enemy during the next few weekson the West Front, as this is the only meansm ofpreventing the transfer of German troops thence to theEastern theatre and of relieving the pressure on the Russianand Roumanian Armies.     This is borne out by GeneralBarter&quot;&apos;s telegram of July 26th ( already circulated  tothe War Cabinet) in which he says that General Shirbacheff,the Commander-in-Chief of the Roumanian Front, told him                                                    that
that the renewal of the Roumanian offensive deponded toa certain extent on developments on the Western Front,It is equally important, of courso, that the offensiveshould be pushed with full vigour and without delay on theItalian Front.     6,   While tho above expresses my views as to theeffect of what has recently happened or may happen inthe near future on the Eastern Front it is advisable tolook further ahead *    The Note prepared at the ParisConference rogarding Russian defection deals with anextreme case, and as I informed the Y/ar Cabinet in mycovering Note I do not consider it is probable thatthe enemy will be ablo for a long time to come to withdrawthe whole of his troops from his Eastern Front,   As soonhowever as it becomes clear that the Russian  and theRoumanian Armies have ceased to have any fighting valueand that the enemy is taking considerable numbers of histroops from his Eastern Front, It will be necessary for usto exorcise spocial economy as regards shipping so as toprovide for a greater prolongation of the war, and we mustalso be ready to put more men on the West Front where un-doubtedly tho issue of the war will be decided.   In otherwords we must cut down to a minimum our commitments insecondary theatres.     7-&apos;*   In this connection Salonika takes first placeas it is there the greatest number of troops are tied up.Most of the time at the Paris Conference was devoted to thequestion of bringing away ene British Division, but thisis not really an important question.   It is merely one ofbalancing risks^ which I can only place before the War Cabinetand leave them to decide *    The British divisions inMacedonia are In strength, equipment, and efficiency,                                                     at
5.184at least the equal of any two of the remaining Allieddivisions, and to withdraw a British division when thesituation in the Near East is critical, and whenit may he possible for the enemy to make a heavyattack on the Macedonian front, is risky, chieflybecause of the moral effect which this would haveupon our Allies at a time when the situation in theNear East is dangerous.  On the other hand the riskinvolved in leaving General Allenby without thisdivision is more certain.  We have definiteinformation that an attack upon General Maude hasbeen preparing for some time past, and it is notpossible to send him in time other reinforcements,than those already arranged for.  It is thereforevery important that the Turks should be forced todivert to the Palestine front troops and ammunition,which might otherwise be sent to Mesopotamia.  TheArabe are now willing and ready to help us, and ifwe take no advantage of this we may discourage themaltogether and so bring about a collapse in Arabiawhich may have a bad effect in the East generally,There is, to my mind, no question but that it is tcour advantage and to that of the Allied causegenerally to take the risk at Salonika in order toeliminate the danger in Mesopotamia.  The questionis whether we can bring our&apos; Allies, to see this, andsince they are not directly concerned this may provedifficult.   If we cannot I suggest that we offer todelay the removal of the division for three or fourweeks, when we shall know whether Russia is able tohold a front which will safeguard the Roumanianflank or not, on the understanding that we mustdecide and be free to withdraw the division withoutfurther parley.
                          6o   8.s I therefore beg the Cab5.net not to waste furthertime at the forthcoming Conference over this wretchedmatter, but, what really is important, to try and arr5.veat a clear future policy for the Balkans,   The only policyI discovered at Paris was tc hold the ground we now have,,keep all the troops there9 and wait until next year andthen see what happens *   But this is a peer apology fora policy;. in view of the shortage of men and shipping,and the activity of the enemy *   I am afraid I cannotadvise the War Cabinet what the policy should be, exceptby repeating that the Salonika forces will never materiallycontribute to the winning of the war, while we may welllose it-if we fail to have sufficient strength on theWest Front and sufficient shipping to meet all and sundryrequirementsc.    As I have al?;ays pointed out to the WarCabinet? tho Salonika Expedition has been from the firststrategically unsoundWhenever the Entente Powers arein difficulties in the Near East those difficulties arereflected at SalonikaP and that is what is happening atthe present timec  We cannot use the large Army we havethere for any-&quot;offensive, and when we desire to move someof the troops elsewhere for urgent and necessary purposeswe are compelled to consider potential dangers arising fromthe false position in which they are placed0  The matter isnow further- complicated by the adherence of Greece to ourcauseo  We can no longer contemplate reducing our forces inMacedonia by falling back upon the entrenched Camp at Salonikasince this would leave Greece open to attack, while on theother hand,, if the present front is to be maintained s-1 cannot say that? as things are at present, it canbe. held by a smaller force if the Bulgarian and Turkish forcesnow facing the Roumanians are free to come down to Macedonia,,
areI do consider, however, that if they v;ere properlycommanded and adequate measures for defence, for whichample timo has heen available, had been made, the troopson the Macedonian front are more than is necessary fordefence.  But the force is not adequately commanded; andI have no assurance that adequate measures for defencehave been taken.  If it becomes necessary to withdrawany considerable number of troops from Salonika, asit will be if the Russian collapse continues and&quot;extends.the only way of doing so which appears to be possiblenow, is to abandon that place, sacrificing a largequantity of stores and material which we shall be unableto move and fall back upon Greece, which the Serbiansand Greeks with the stiffening of three on four French,British or Italian divisions should be able to defend,     9.     As regards Mesopotamia wo could probablymake no reduction if and when Russia drops out; as ourpolicy there is not merely a question of Baghdad; but ofPersia, the Arabs, Afghanistan, and India, and it demandsnot only that we guard against defeat but that we win avictory if attacked.  For this It is necessary we shouldbe active in Palestine, and also have at least a emailreserve there to meet eventualities in the East.  I amtherefore strongly of opinion that the guns and extradivision General Allenby has asked for should be sent. Atthe same time it must be borne in mind that with Russiaout of the war wo shall have to deal with the whole of theTurkish forces, numbering about half a million, and thereforeto hold our own successfully in Mesopotamia, and to givethe Turk a beating on the Gaza - Beersheba line is  allwe can at present hope to achieve.         The Turks
are undoubtedly tired of the war,  but whether a defeat inMesopotamia, another in Southern Palestine,  and anannouncement that they might keep their pre-war territory,Including Constantinople, would cause them to make peaceis a quebtion which I leave to the War Cabinet.   All I cansay is that defeats in Mesopotamia and Southern Palestinewould not destroy Turkey1s military power.   I may add thatif Russia does drop out we shall eventually have t&amp;consider the reduction of Allenby1s force.   Less than hewill have en the arrival of the proposed reinforcementsshould suffice for the passive defence of Egypt.   Thismatter, however, depends upon what happens in the meantimein Southern Palestine and the East generally.     10.  I At the Paris Conference the Prime Minister          rraised theft question of making an early and combined          t;attack against Austria from the Italian Front.   I havealready giVen the War Cabinet my advice on this matter,and I need only add that-I agree, generally, with theConclusions reached by Generals Poch, Caderna, andmyself at the Conference as shown in the Paper alreadyCirculated.   It will be observed that General Cadornastated that he would require 400 more heavy guns and10 divisions to make a decisive attack under presentconditions;  he could not say what he would requireafter completion of his present operations;   and he couldnot engage to undertake any extensive operations betweenOctober and April next.
   11.    To sum up,  I submit the  following proposalsfor consideration :-  (a)  Assist Russia to keep on her foot by sendingBritish Naval officers and French Military officers toimprove matters in the Russian Navy and Army respectivo-iy.  fb)  America to be charged with improving transport-ation (defective distribution of food, etc., is morelikely than anything else to cause Russia to make aseparate peace).  (c)  We must economise shipping so as to provideagainst prolongation of the war and to ensure transportfor the American troops.  (d)  This means cutting down commitments in secondarytheatres.   Salonika is chiefly concerned for thepresent in this respect, and a clear and definite Balkanpolicy is required to guide Military Advisers andCommanders in the field.  (e)  A British Division,  with a proportion of heavyartillery, to be transferred from Salonika to Egypt in3 to 4 weeks&apos; time if we consider the situation on theEastern front admits.  (f)  Sentiment must not be allowed to over-ridemilitary requirements.   (None of our Balkan Allies willget what they want unless decisive military results aregained,  and this will never be done in the Balkans.)  (g)  The so-called &quot;War Aims&quot; should at.once be review-ed and an agreement reached as to the modificationsnecessary and possible in the event of Russia andRoumania ceasing to take a reasonably effective share inthe war.   (If they do so cease it would be folly to es-pect to realise existing aims,  and therefore the soonerthe hostile Powers concerned are made aware of anymodifications which can be  made the better. )29.7.17.W.R.
