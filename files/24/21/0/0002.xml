Intelligence Bureau,     Department of Information.            DEW/012.WEEKLY REPORTj ON BUIgARlA. XII.      (July 24, 1917).The Government and Its Opponents.     It may he remembered that the present Bulgarian Governmentof Mr Radoslavov is, in fact, a Coalition including not onlyRadoslavov&apos;s own party, hut that of Mr Tonchev, Minister ofFinance (the &quot;Young Liberal Party&quot;), and a wing of theStambolovist Party.   It is, therefore, natural that when thingsare not going entirely smoothly and there is a lack of theshowy military successes which the Bulgarian people were led toexpect, discontent should arise with the Government cn the partboth of parties opposed to it, of those nominally in alliancewith it, and, still more, of the public as a whole.   There isgood reason to believe that relations are especially strainedbetween Mr Radoslavov and Mr Tonchev and the two are carryingon perpetual intrigues against each other both in Bulgariaand in the Germanic Empires.   (Mr Radoslavov has just returnedfrom a prolonged visit to Germany  md Austria-Hungary).  Infact, it is probably only the influence of Tsar Ferdinand whichholds the Government together,  When the Government was formedin 1913 it was Ferdinand who induced Radoslavov and Tonchevto sink their feuds and join forces, and as both of them havebeen involved in notorious financial&apos; scandals Ferdinand hasconsiderable hold over them.   A similar hold is possessedby the German Government, with which, consequently, bothMinisters separately carry on personal negotiations.  There seems, in fact, to be considerable disquiet in Bulgarian Government
    circles, as the uninviting prospect of war  indefinitely pro-    longed without any certainty cf victory has much depressed theC   Bulgarian public and occasioned spasmodic riots  in Sofia directed    against Ferdinand and his henchmen.        It would, of course, be quite weong to suppose that the    apprehension of the Government or the  disquiet  of the  public    as a whole is directed against the alliance with the Central    Powers, though the Germans personally appear  to  be intensely    unpopular.   Politically, however, practically all the  Bulgarian    politicians of to-day have thrown in their  lot with the Central    European Alliance.   The former &quot;Russophil&quot; parties have either    ceased to be Russophil or have ceased to count.    An instance    of the latter fate is that of the Progressive Party (sometimes    known as the Tsankovist, from the name of its founder),  which    is led by the ex-Prime Minister, Dr Danev.    The disappearance    of the Autocracy in Petrograd gave the coup de grace to the    hopes of Dr Danev, who bad been very much under  a cloud ever    since October 1915.   As for the other &quot;Russophil&quot; parties,    Mr Geshov has been discreet enough - perhaps  owing to the fact    that the government holds over his head and that of Dr  Danev    the sword of Damocles in the shape of the Parliamentary Commission    appointed to examine their former administrations and which  has    never yet. in spite of the demands of the Socialists, published    its findings - to refrain from active participation in  public    life and to confine his energies to appearances  on ceremonial    occasions and to an unblushing championship of Central European    interests in his paper the Mir.   His attitude has been  endorsed    by that of his followers, the brothers Ivan and  Boris Vazov,(   Peyev-Plyachkov (editor of the Mir), and Teodorov.    Mr  Geshov1 s    Nationalist Party yields to none in its demands  for the  whole
 of Macedonia, Dobrogea  and  the Merava Valley,   Not less chauvinist is the Democratic  Party led by the  ex-Prime Minister (1908-11) Mr Malinov.   His  paper,  the  Preporets,  is energetically champion- ing  the most  extreme  territorial demands and continues almost daily to  inveigh against the  Austrian and Hungarian Socialists who  advise Bulgaria to  &quot;compromise&quot; with Serbia over Macedonia, Iflp-Malinov is spending  the  month of July in Vienna and Karlsbad, together  with two  of  his supporters, the ex-Ministers Mushanov and  General Nlkolayev (a veteran of the  1877 war and since then^repeatedly War  Minister and colleague of Malinov),   (The discredit ed.-Cexnmeader-in-Chief,  General Savov, is also living in Karlsbad). All  these persons, together with the other Democratic Party leaders - men like Danailov and   Professor Molov - may be described as  frankly  Germanoph.il.  It has been conjectured that they are  actually  subsidised  by  Germany.  In any case, the Gers&amp;an Government  and these Opposition leaders see the mutual advantage of  being on friendly terms, and if the Opposition leaders attack the Radoslavov Government it is with no intention of destroying the  Central  European  Alliance (which they constantly uphold in their organs), but  with the intention of replacing Radoslavov as the  trusted friends of the Central Powers,      In a previous Report (No.5) some account was given of the new &quot;Alliance of Bulgarian  Savants, Writers and Artists&quot; -  -                                      before established by  Mi?  Geshov in order to put/the neutral and enemy world the &quot;justifications&quot;  for Bulgaria1 s territorial demands. An article which recently appeared in the Democratic organ, Preporets. from the pen of  the ex-Minister Mikhail Takev, claiming that Bulgaria was  racially  justified in demanding all and more than all  the  Treaty of  San  Stefano had offered her, was warmly approved/by  the Mir,  which  declared that Mr Takev had awoken to the
fact always preached by the Mir that in time of war literarymen are bound to put their pens, just as much as soldiers theirswords, at the service of the Government of their country.Mr Geshov and Mr Malinov can be, in their own opinion, moreuseful to Bulgaria than supporters of the Government in cajolingthe Entente Powers into favourable recognition of Bulgariandemands.  With this, object in view the Bulgarian authoritiesare increasing their activities in Switzerland.  The Ministerat Bern, Mr Pasarov (Mr Radevls successor), is regarded asinadequate for this task.  It is expected that he may soon berecalled, and the Military Attach^, Colonel Chervenakov, hasalready succeeded in  securing the - appointment to the Consulateat Geneva of Mr Milchev and Mr Yanev, both leading officialsin the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.     The position of Mr Racho Kosev, discussed in my last Report,appears to be strengthened of late.   Prince Doris, according tothe press, recently did him the honour of paying him a visitsand the Turkish Government has conferred on him the Grand Ribbonof the Mejidieh Order.Stockholm and the Socialists..     It seems clear that increasing weight in the country attachesto the four Socialist and Agrarian parties.  Much attention ispaid to them in the Press and to-day, as champions of thepeasants&apos; rights and of a speedy peace, they represent publicopinion far better than the Government or the traditionalOpposition leaders.     Dr Sakyzov, leader of the &quot;Broad&quot; Socialist Party, was thelast of his party to return from Stockholm.  After giving areport  in glowing terms of what he had been able to do there,
he again went off to Sweden in expectance of the meeting of theConforence.  The &quot;Narrow&quot; Socialist delegate, Mr Kolarov, has alsoreturned to Sofia, eervling his colleague, 5 p Kirkov, in Stockholm.Relations between these two Socialist parties are worse than ever.The Narrow Socialist drgan daily attacks the Broad SocialistParty, which it  always now describes as the &quot;Broad Nationalist&quot;Party.  It is especially angry with them for their claims forBulgaria&apos;s territorial aggrandisement and their dismissal of theNarrow Socialists1 dream of a Balkan Federal Republic as a&quot;fantasy and a Utopia&quot;,  In a series of articles it seeks toprove that a Balkan Federal Republic has always been the avowedaim of true Balkan Socialists and is the only method of settlingtho Balkan question permanently and of avoiding perpetual wars.Territorial Alms.     &quot;Macedonia, &apos;Pomoravsko&apos; (i.e. the Morava valley) andDobrogea&quot; is now the regularly formulated demand of all partiesin Bulgaria,  The press is now insisting on the racialjustifications of Bulgaria1s claims to the district, and bookshave recently appeared on this subject from the press- of ProfessorsRomanski, Chilingirov, Zanetov and Ishirkov.  A more seriousargument advanced is  the need for Bulgaria, from the &quot;politicaland economic&quot; point of view, to remain in territorial contact withCentral Europe.   Ishirkov writes that Serbian interference withthis connection in the past has been so intolerable that &quot;evenputting out of sight the Bulgarian character of this province,Bulgaria will not be able to give up the contiguity which hasbeen happily established between Austria-Hungary and our country.This is what we ought to make European opinion understand so thatit can  resign itself once for all to the idea of the final reunion
24.7.17.of the Merava country to its Motherland, Bulgaria&quot;.     A new daily paper named the Moravsk^ files (&quot;Voice of Morava&quot;)has now begun in Nish and &quot;will chiefly occupy itself with theMorava country&quot;.The Military Situation. .     Apparently there is considerable disquiet in Bulgaria as tothC spirit and&quot; prospects of the Bulgarian army at the front,for the papers do nothing but praise the spirit and organisationof the army, and representative men of various political partieshave been sent to the front in order to record their impressionsin the press.   Needless to say their impressions are souniformly favourable as to raise the suspicion that they&quot;protest too much&quot; and that the Bulgarian army is not particularlyenthusiastic about further hostilities.    Puther informationon thiB point, however, does not fall within the province ofthis Report, and is a matter for the military authorities.                                         A.W.A.I..
