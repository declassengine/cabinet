PART  I.-ACTION  TAKEN.                          ORDERS AND  REGULATIONS.    By an Order in Council, dated July 17, further  amendments were ordered to  bemade in the Defence of the Realm Regulations for the purpose of enabling the FoodController, as respects articles to which his powers under Regulations 2f to 2j extend,to exercise the like powers as are already conferred  on the Admiralty, Army  Council,and Minister of Munitions.  In particular :     (1)  To amend Regulation 2G by the substitution for subsection (1) thereof of the          following  subsection :                  The Food Controller may by order require persons engaged in the             production,  manufacture, purchase, sale, distribution, transport,  storage,             or shipment of any article  to which the powers of the Food Controller             extend, to make returns giving  such particulars as to  their businesses             as may  be specified by or  on behalf  of the Food  Controller, and may             require the  returns to be verified as he may direct.    (2)  To amend Regulation 2GG by the  omission of  subsection (4) thereof and          by the insertion after  subsection  (3)  thereof  of  the following new          subsections:                  &quot; (4) It shall be lawful for the Food Controller :                    &quot; (a) To require any work in any such factory or workshop or               other premises as aforesaid to be done in  accordance with his direc-               tions  given with the object  of  making the  factory or workshop or               other premises or the plant or labour therein  as useful as  possible for               the production of food.                   &quot; (b) To regulate or restrict the carrying on of any work in any               such factory, workshop, or other premises as aforesaid, or  the engage-               ment or employment of any workman, or all or any classes of workmen,               therein, or to remove  the plant therefrom, with a view to maintaining               or increasing the production of food.                 &quot; (5) The occupier and every officer and  servant of the  occupier             of any factory, workshop, or other premises, or any other person affected             by any such directions,  regulations, or  restrictions, and   where the             occupier is a  company, every  director of  the  company shall  obey the : l&apos;           directions, regulations, or restrictions  of the Food  Controller, and if he             fails to do  so he shall be guilty of  a summary offence against these             regulations.                 &quot; (6) Where under this regulation any directions regulating the             priority to be given to work at any factory, workshop or other premises,             have been given, and any person in any certificate  or  document given             or issued for the purpose of securing priority for any work in pursuance             of such directions, makes any false statement or false representation, he             shall be guilty of a summary offence against these regulations.&quot;    (3) To amend Regulation 2j by the insertion at the end of subsection (5) thereof           of the  words, &quot; and any powers  and duties necessary to provide for the           &quot; due  discharge of  any functions assigned to local authorities by any           &quot; order made by the Food Controller under the said Regulations.&quot;    No Orders under the  Defence of the Realm Regulations have  been issued from the Ministry during the week.                                FOOD  ECONOMY.     Mr. Kennedy Jones,  M.P., has resigned  his appointment as Director-General of Food Economy.   The reports received by the Ministry of Food show that real  economy     A (.33)3443-4 Pk 1  50 7/17  E &amp; S                  &quot;                        A
 has been effected in food consumption, and Lqrd Rhonddrfor -thecSCrvibe^cfehdered                              the past three months.&quot;- -   Lord  Khondda has  sent  the following message  to  the Food Controller&apos; of -Canada :             &quot; We look to resources  of Canada and to indomitable energy of Canadians       for an answer  that will shatter Germany&apos;s threat of  starvation.   In normal       times Mother  Country is dependent upon  your  Dominion for a large part oftOi  : :  its  food  supplies.   War has accentuated that dependence to such extent that       it is now  vital for United Kingdom and Allies &apos; in Europe to  obtain  from-      Canada  foodstuffs  in far  larger  quantities  than  under  peace conditions. &apos;     That must  necessarily  entail  ceaseless  effort and far-reaching economy with    -   their attendant sacrifices  on  the  part  of  Canadians.   I know  that  like,.tfriJ   ourselves at home the  pick of your manhood  have gone  and are going to .-.     take their  splendid share  in the front line of  battle  and that therefore you  i  &apos;   are  faced with the difficulty of a  supply of labour.   I also realise that an    -   increased export of food supplies must  entail a  diversion of  effort from  other      ; enterprises.  Yet  I am convinced that people  of Canada will surmount allv c    obstacles and that the harvest  so far as human labour can achieve  will be a       striking  demonstration  of  Canada&apos;s  efficiency  and   determination.    The       willingness  of  the  Canadian people to  permit  the control  of their products . .   ,  for purpose of winning war is naturally welcomed by all Allies as tending       to increase  supply and to  regulate prices.  When I say that since the war       prices of bread, flour, and  cheese in. the United Kingdom  have been at least       doubled, that   cheaper  cuts of meat are dearer by 191 per cent.,  sugar by       188  per  cent.,  and potatoes by 144 per cent.,  you will understand  natural       anxiety with which we  view this phase of food problem.  The certainty that       we can rely upon your  whole-hearted co-operation not only in utilising  every       ounce of national energy  to increase production but in equitable adjustment .   .   of prices gives me the greatest encouragement.   I most heartily  wish you    ,:,  every success in your  all-important work.&quot;V - &apos; ,                    CONTROL  OF  SUPPLIES AND  PRICES.     Bread. The Food Controller has announced that  he will  make arrangements to lower the price of  bread at  the earliest possible date  to  9d. throughout  the  United Kingdom.  This reduction necessitates a large  national subsidy, the amount of which depends upon the price of  purchases and the  success of the submarine campaign. No estimate of  the amount of  this subsidy has been published, nor can it be given with  any approach to accuracy.   The intention  is  to  sell imported wheat to flour millers at  a parity with the  price at which  the home-grown wheat is to be sold. Flour millers in turn will sell to bakers flour at a price which, in the great majority of cases, will permit the  bakers to sell the 9d. loaf.     The quality of the bread  throughout the  country  has  improved and  is steadily improving with better service  of wheat and more experience of the novel difficulties of the situation in the minds of millers and bakers.  Millers in many cases have been able to improve their machinery, and to market a better ground flour, while bakers have learned  that  their old  methods are in certain  cases unsuitable to  the changed circumstances.  The  cooler weather has been another  factor  in the situation, as the difficulties of storage of bread by bakers increased with  a rise in the temperature.     The Ministry of  Food are  hastening  the education of the trade by following up all cases  brought to  their notice  of bad  milling, and  their  technical staff is fully employed  in  investigating these  incidents.  Cases of bad  bread  and any reports of illness  arising  from   the  quality of  bread are  investigated  by  the special Board appointed by the Royal Society as they occur.     Meat. The Food Controller has  announced that  arrangements  are being  made to fix, as from September 1, the prices of  cattle and meat required for military and civilian consumption.   It has been decided after consultation with the Army Council and&apos; the several Departments of Agriculture that the following shall be the maximum prices for live cattle for the Army:          September      -      .....       ,      .  74 s. per live cwt.

Maximum  prices will  bei:&apos;fixedon a  corresponding basis for civilian consumption and steps  will be taken to control the profit of butchers and of  all dealers, whether British or foreign, so as to  ensure  that the benefit  of  the  reduced prices will accrue to the consumer.     Sugar. Lord Rhondda is engaged in adjusting the final details of the scheme for the  more  equitable distribution of &quot;sugar  which  has been  approved  by  the War Cabinet.  The Local Government Board and  the representatives of the local authorities have expressed their willingness to co-operate in the fullest possible manner,  and the machinery will be set in motion so soon as the necessary organisation is complete.     Tea. The total stock of tea in this country on June 30 was nearly 77,000,000 lbs., compared  with 84,500,000  lbs. at  the  corresponding  date last  year,  and  with 75,000,000 lbs. in 193 5.   The amended rules for the control  of  90 per cent, of the tea imports have now been published; and they have been found  to remove  some of the difficulties experienced under the preceding scheme.   Some traders,  especially in Ireland, seem disinclined to take up their quota of the A class control tea  which has to be retailed at 2s.  id. per lb.  And there is  some anxiety felt, owing to scarcity of tonnage and enemy action, as to future replenishment of stocks.     Butter. Anxiety is  again felt as  to the reduced  shipment of butter from Australia owing to fear of submarine losses.     Fruit and Jam, Conferences have been held with  representatives  of the dried fruit trade and with jam manufacturers, and  the questions of taking control of the.dried fruit trade and of fixing maximum prices for jam have been  discussed.                             ENFORCEMENT  OF ORDERS.     Meat (Sales) Order, 1917.  A considerable number of complaints of  the infringe- ment of this Order have  been received and further steps have been taken to  secure the prompt detection of offences.  The Market Reporters to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries have been  invited to co-operate in this matter.   The Chief  Constable of Huntingdonshire has established a good case  against several offenders and has been asked to prosecute and to press for imprisonment.   The Borough Authority of Newport, Monmouthshire, has also been requested  to institute  proceedings against buyers w7ho have failed to report the slaughter of cattle bought in the market there.     Sugar (Domestic Preserving) Order, 1917.  Correspondence received shows  that it is  generally believed  that the  Order has  been constantly  abused.  Sugar has frequently been obtained on the strength, of a  false  declaration  on the application form.   In such cases, the authorities are inclined  to  prosecute  under Article 5 of  the Order, but such prosecutions are not sustainable as the Order is dated the 11th June and the applications were made prior to that date.  This Ministry is accordingly recom- mending the authorities to prosecute under Articles 1 and 4.  The Cheltenham Police are taking action in several cases and the  National War Savings Committee  has recommended similar action in response to numerous complaints.  A conviction was obtained at Bromley the defendant being fined 101.     Wheat, Rye, and Bice (Restriction) Order, .1917. .  Several complaints of the waste of foodstuffs at naval and military canteens have been received, and have  been referred for investigation to the h.aval and military authorities.                PART IT.-SUMMARY  OF FOOD  POSITION.    Though lower than  during the last two weeks, the imports,of wheat and flourare sufficient to secure an increase in the stocks in the country, after  consumption hasbeen  allowed  for.   The  maintenance of the stocks at  the level  required  at thebeginning of the period of raised consumption, namely, the autumn and winter, %illdepend on the imports of the next few weeks.    An interesting feature  in the record  of wholesale  prices  is  the  tendency ofBritish and foreign meat, after considerable divergence; to return to a more  normalrelationship.;,       -u)!?            &apos;                            &apos;,                                                                         A 2
                                  . IMPORTS.  &apos;  ,  &apos;       bzw  iminrim.imsi   ;.   ; Though the record shown  in last  week&apos;s report has not again been reached, theaggregate weight of principal foods  was again at a high  level-316,000 tons inthe week ending July 21st.   It was pointed  out last week that the  increase thenstated was due to heavy imports of  wheat and  flour, this week they are at the samelevel as a fortnight ago.  ,    The  last five weeks&apos; imports of wheat and of meat were as follows : Week ending	Wheat and Wheaten Flour.	Beef and Mutton.June 23 ,,.30 - - -July 7 -,, 14 - - -.. ,, 21 - - -	Tons. 162,000 180,000 200,000 266,000 198,000	Tons. 3,500 8,100 9,400 8,600 11,000   - Last wreek a heavy consignment of  beef  was received and imports of mutton-were also higher than in the corresponding week last year.   For the 29 weeks of thisyear, however, imports of beef are 35,200  tons (19 per cent.) and of mutton 15,500 tons(16 per cent.) less than in the corresponding weeks of 1916.    Less bacon was received than for  many weeks  past;  and in the aggregate forthis year so far the imports of bacon and hams  are 6,100 tons (2\ per cent.) less thanin the 29 weeks of 1916.    Both margarine and butter were last  week far below the average for the 29 weeksof 1916 or 1917, but  the aggregate  of  the two for  1917 so far is  up to last year&apos;slevel.    40,800 tons of sugar were imported, an amount greater than in any of the previousfour weeks, and more than the average in  1913 or in the first  29 weeks of  1916 or1917.    There  was a considerable  increase  in barley but  some falling off in  oats andmaize as compared with the  previous week.   Taking the three together we find thatthe total in last week was 26 per cent, below the corresponding week last year, and38 per cent, below the average for  1913. There is a deficit of 200,000 tons  on  theyear so far  as compared with 1916.    7,700 tons of rice were received, more than twice the weekly average  importationfor the first half of the year.                             CONSUMPTION OF MEAT.    The supplies of meat entering the markets of London, Manchester, Liverpool, andGlasgow were 384 tons (6 per cent.) less  in the week ending July  14th than in theprevious week; at Liverpool and  Manchester  there was a slight  increase, at Londonand Glasgow a decrease.  In London, however, there was some recovery in  the weekJuly 16th-21st.   The  supply  is  considerably  less than in the  corresponding weekof 1916 and below  the average for any  month in the first half of the  years 1916of 1917.    The number of fat cattle at 51 markets  in Great Biitain was 11 per cent, lessin the week ending July 18th than in the  previous week, though 2 per cent, above thecorresponding week last year.  The supply of  fat sheep was 14 per cent, below thatof the previous week, though it was  above the  average for previous months this year ;it was  10 per cent, below the supply of the corresponding week last year.     There  were more pigs in the markets than in the previous week, but  the suppliesare still small.                               WHOLESALE  PRICES.     There  are changes since the last Report in the prices of barley, beef, mutton,bacon, butter, and linseed cake.     Barley has risen Is.  3d., making  2s. 8d. in the fortnight.  It is still 3s. lowerthan a month ago, but higher than in March, April, or May.     English beef and mutton have fallen  for the third week in succession.  Beef hadrisen from  Ills, at the end of April to 141s. at the end of June; in  the  week endedJuly 18th it was at 129s.   Mutton was  at about  127s.  in March and April, touched179s. at the end of May, and has since fallen nearly regularly till it reached 138s. last
&apos;5;week.   Oa the oilier hand Argentine chilled beef has again risen, 3s. Qd. in the week,7s. 6d. in the fortnight, and the differeneg-vtat^een Argentine and English which hasbeen excessive is returning, to the normal:  The price;pf.,Argentine mutton has.beenpractically unchanged since the beginning ol; May.                           &quot;.    ts...,,,s     Bacon  continues to rise in price.   Danish and Canadian have risen continually;for five and four weeks  respectively, and  now Irish has moved  Is. Qd.  up.  Danishand Irish are, however, no  dearer than in April.  The trade  complains  of a shortage&apos;.&apos;of supplies and anticipates further increases.in price.                           &quot;&apos;     Irish butter has again risen 2s.  after an  increase of 7s. 6d. in the previous fort-night.   Danish and New Zealand  butter have  fallen slightly but  are still higher thana fortnight ago.  .TABLE A. IMPORTS OF PRINCIPAL FOOD AND FEEDING STUFFS......Article. 1.
