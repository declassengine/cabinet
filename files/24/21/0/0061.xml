S B 0111*G.T.1560               g8g  CABIffST.     IRISH  SEDITIONS,.(Memorandum by 24r, Duke)       The administrative issues which are raised by seditiousspeech-making in Ireland are shown in the  repori from a policeshorthand writer, which I have just received,, of speeches madeat an open air meeting in the City of Kilkenny during the by-election ndW proceeding there.  About five thousand personswere present and behaved in an orderly way*  The principalspeakers were - Mr.  de Valera, M.P., Mr. L. Glnnell, M.P., and Mr. 3)arrell Figgis.  The most striking passages from theirspeeches are appended:-   D3 VALERA. M.P.  How the issues olearly are these - we   stand for an Irish Republic;   we say  i- Irish Republic   because it is the most natural form whioh the Government   of a free Ireland would take;   we say it also as comrades   of the men who died for establishing it.They proclaimed it  .   and sealed it with their blood,  and it Is our duty to carry   on, and please God we will carry on till we win.  We stand   then for an Irish Republic.  Companions, if we have any,   can only be companions in a sense that they stand for   separation for the Empire.   We wont have anything to do   with the Empire;   we want nothing less than to be a nation,   and not that these others would have us to be - five-sixths   of a province.   The two sides are,  union with England, and   absolute separation for which we stand.   ...... We say to  the minority &quot;If you stand in our way of   freedom we will clear you out of it&quot;.......  $hat flag -   (pointing to the  Sinn Foin flag) ie nationality against   Imperialism;   it  is Ireland against England i...... Vote   for the man who with his two  brothers went oui (i.e. in the   Rebellion) and lost one of them who fell at hie side.   That   is the man you have to vote for .......   and all Irishmen   all over the  world will be proud of you as they were of the   men who went  out  and died in Easter week.L. OIHIJBLL. M.P.  This contest and all thefc  belongs to itis a continuation of the insurrection of Easter week....... Those men saw that it was necessary to aim at highideals to revive the soul of Ireland.  That had often beendone in the past;  it could only be done by the saorificeof human life.  Human life had been sacrificed at othertimes and the revival was only of short duration.  Butthese men saw that England was in difficulties and gettinginto greater difficulties still, and that, as in the pastso in the present, Englandfs difficulties were Ireland^opportunities.   They timed their insurrection so that it
-   - t is  an  account  of  the  result  of it ....   this enthusiasmwo have witnessed this evening  is sweeping all over thecountry from end  to  end.&apos;  And  tho particular  advantage of itsoccurring at this time is  due to  the fact  that this Is England1 ssupreme difficulty and therefore  Ireland^ suprezne opportunity.She greatest nation  In the v/orld  has England &quot;by the throat to-day,......  England,,  the only  enemy country  that Ireland has or everhad...... the insurrection of  Easter week was under therepublican flag,,  end I at  all events regard the proclamation ofEaster week as the proclamation under which we are fighting theseelections,, end under which the  election  In Kilkenny is going tobe fought..DffilELL HggIS*   In  this  election we stand for absolute separationIron England  ....  The  issue  is  this,  whether Ireland is to bo aserf, a slavo  to  England; or whether Ireland must bo absolutely freeand independent.   I give my  allogiance  to the republic, but If thepeople of  Ireland decide  that some othor form of Government wouldbe more useful to this  country;   if the  majority eo decide I willagree with thorn.   But  the majority of the Irish people never willdeoido anything elso only that Ireland shall bo freo and independent,      These throe persons could under Dofonoo of the Realm Regulation  42   tried by Court Martial for sedition - and would I suppose inevitably txj convicted.    In viow of tho decision of the War Cabinet as to limiting prosecutions to overt acts of lawlessness and incit^ionts to immediate crime, vj&amp;enoo or disorder, no prosecution  in rospeot of these speeches has boon direoted.   I circulate them as instances of. a kind of oratory in respect of which at aome-&apos;nofr distant day It nay be necessary to place some of the Readers of the Irish Revolutionary Eovement under definite restraint.      The organisation of &quot;Sinn Foin&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot; Clubs continuos, find this open-noss with which it is at prosont conducted would make its overturn fairly easy if such a course should scorn advisablo. So far as I csn judge from the reports that reach me, the reoeption among the majority of tho population of this policy of foroe is not encouraging to the spokesmen of that policy.   $hoy are directing a good deal of their oratory now to explain that they are not atpresent a physical force party.   They ore also I suspect trying toget a following for a scheme  of passive resistance against taxation.                                   f initialled)    H. 33. p.   .SOth July,  1917.
