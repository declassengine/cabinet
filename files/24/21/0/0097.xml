THE STATE OF IRELAND.

(Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.)

The Sinn Fein movement continues to make steady progress in the Midlands and West of Ireland, with growing evidence of systematic organisation and widespread popular support. By means of public meetings in provincial centres, the formation of clubs, the circulation of cleverly written papers which keep within the letter of the law, and the activity of very numerous local leaders who get held of the youth of the country, the propaganda which has been in active operation since the early spring is for the present successful in dominating the attention of all classes in the country.

The machinery in use has not altered. There is a head-quarters Office in Dublin with a Central Council; Clubs continue to be established in the towns and in the rural centres; de Valera and Griffith and a not very large number of paid organisers travel the country with extraordinary diligence and get an enthusiastic response; and there are persistent attampts to revive the drilling and marching which made the Irish Volunteers before the Rebellion a dangerous force. The clubs which have been established now number above 300. Those in Dublin bring together every considerable numbers of the adherents of the revolutionary movement who are known to the police. All such meetings are kept under observation and reported upon. In various provincial centres men identified as leaders in attempted revivals of drilling are being prosecuted. They include certain of the recently released rebels.

With regard to attempts at drilling in County Clare, the Inspector-General, Royal Irish Constabulary, reports as follows:-


          &quot;As tho rosuit of the East Clare Election a very     &quot;rebellious spirit has been stirred up in that county     &quot;and part of Gal way adjoinlrg It, drilling was- openly     &quot;resumed in defiance of the law.   Mne ox the loaders     &quot;have,  however, been arrested for this oxfenco and     &quot;handed over to military custody for trial by court-     &quot;martial, and it is said that this procodure has already     &quot;produced a steadying effect.&quot;     In the  Dublin KetroixJlitafc aroa small parties of men and of youths and girls marched out on Sunday lasi - Stnday id tho usual lay for 3uch oxSroisos - and partiss of police were posted  to intercept them on their return, out they evaded observation and dispersed without giving an opportunity for arrests  or identifications.   The police are alert with ragard to this form of lawlessness, and will no doubt succeed in at any rate bringing to acoount tho ringleaders of any considerable attempt.     Vigilance ia being used wl3&amp; regard to possiblo attempts to introduce arms.    Incidentally, one of the&apos; firemen of a oollier was  arrested on landing in -Dublin this week with a considerable store  of revolver ammunition and some *303 rifle cartridges.    At his house a rifle was found.   Ho is awaiting trial by courtmartial.     Questions of prosecution in respoet of some seditious spaechos are under consideration, but prosecution may not bo found advisable.   At prosent tho Sinn Fein leaders generally aro assuming, a los3 violent tone than they recently used. Inatead of wild talk they arc making argumentative appeals fornational anti-Britiah organisation,  e.g., by  ascribing tho isabiiitios ef Ireland in trade and industry and by insistenceon the burden of tho &quot;Tar taxation of the country - roughlyestimated at  30,000,000 a year, instead of the Irish peaceburden of, say, eight or ton millions, and in one &amp;ay&apos;s issueof the Irish papers appeared the following declarations      A. SRI?Pia?Ht   They wora not out for red revolution;          votes were at: tho present time moro powerful          than bullets and therefore it was vital to got          the people to stand on tho platform of Sinn Fein.
