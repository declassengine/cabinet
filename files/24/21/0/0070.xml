Memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office,2ith a covering note fry the .Secietary of        State for the Colonies.           I  circulate  a Memorandum on the oil situation athone.    I  recommend that a Bill be  prepared at once and askfor Cabinet authority.    The  Bill will of course hecirculated.    I  suggest that  the 3-ill might with advantagebe introduced in the House of Lords.    The matter is urgentand the  policy of Kis Majesty&apos;s Government ought to hedeclared.                     (Initialled)    W.H.L.                                        28.7.1?.Jl \ORA]TDin:\           The present scarcity of petroleum products rakesit necessary to develop any available sources of supply.           There is a good prospect of obtaining petroleunin England,  but the practical difficulties of negotiatingwith landowners will prevent results being obtained in areasonable time by unaided private enterprise.           Petroleum is a fluid and moves easily under theearth.    Hence a well in Ale field nay extract all thepetroleum under B,C, P&apos;s field over a large area, and atlaw E,C,D, have no right to a share in the proceeds.           Hence either there must be a pooling of mineralrights  over the whole petroliferous area, which involvesprotracted negotiation and may in the end be deleaved by anobstinate landowner, or there will be indiscriminate boring assoon as an area is proved.   7.ach o^ner wi] 1 pvrvp as hard ashe can  to prevent his neighbours dra^inr: the oil away from.his land.   This means waste of a va-luable national asset, asis shown by American.experience.           As no liquid petroleum has yet been proved in theUnited  Kingdom, state control can be introduced with amininun of disturbance and friction.           The suggestion is that there should be legislationreserving to the Crown the right to bore for and win&apos;oil, and giving access to the land for the ymrpose, withpower to take land for surface operations, subject to pa3T.entof surface rents, ^ay leaves, and reasonable compensation.G.T.-1569             TAP, CABIffST.               THS OIL  SITUATION AT  HOT!
     Payment for oil won within a defined area should bedistributed among surface owners by an impartial technicaltribunal, similar to that set up under the Land AcquisitionAct,1916.  The tribunal should have power to define the areaand to fix a rate of payment per ton of oil won.     During the v:ar the State might bore on its own account?afterwards definite areas might be put up to auction amonglessees.  It would be essential to avoid granting a monopolyover the whole country though probably each area had betterbe leased to one lessee.     There Is a clear case for State control in war time.But State control cannot be limited to the period of the war,as even, if the State did all the boring, there would  beprotracted negotiations at the end of the prescribed period,great dela^  at a time when oil will be wanted for industrialpurposes, and an unjustifiable unearned increment for the ownerswhose land had been proved at public expense.  If the Statedid not do the boring no private person would risk his moneyin doing it if he was to be left to the mercy of the ownersat the end of the war.     The present proposals seem to be for the good of ownersas well as the State, and have in fact been approved   byrepresentatives of the Land Union     The only parallel case in this country is in the BrineIndustry of Cheshire.  In this Ease much litigation hasresulted, owing to   \  lack of suitable co-ordination.     In regard to brine no difficulty has arisen in connectionwith Royalty on the mineral, but the surface subsidence,resultanton punning, produced a state of affairs which made it impossir^Cto decide by whom the damage had been done.     A Brine Compensation Board was established by Parliamentto deal with ell claims, and a pooling arrangement thus setup by which each Company paid to the Board 3d per 1000gallons, from which claims for damage are met.      It is not suggested that damage will arise inconnection with working Petroleum, but tho brine caseshould be borne in mind.  The reason why the Royaltyarrangements in connection with brine are not ap licablcis due to the fact that the brine is produced by merelydissolving out Mineral Salt which exists as a bed belowthe surfc.ee, -\nd so far the supply has been almostunlimited.     The impartial tribunal which it is proposed toset up for Petroleum would consist of a bor-rd of say threemembers, two of which should possess expert knowledge.The tribunal&apos;s duties would include fixing the royalty tobe paid, the area to be included in oil pool, andthe general terms upon which :. company could work the area.     The areas which offer special inducement to  drillingfor Jatural Petroleum r.re Nottingham,  Derby and SouthYorkshire, also North Staffordshire and part of Lancashire,and a small patch in Southern Scotland.
        The history of the case is briefly as follows:.-        Messrs. S. Pearson &amp; Company heave for several yearsbeen carrying on a careful geological survey of theBritish Isles with a view to selecting the areas in whichtest drilling should be undertaken, and as a result of thisenquiry arrangements have been en bored into and leasesnegotiated between Messrs, Pearson and various land ownersThose negotiations are apparently not sufficiently advancedto enable Messrs.  Pearson to commence drilling withoutseriously prejudicing the policy which they had outlinedand in these circumstances this firm brought the matter tothe notice of the  Government.    Their policy virtual:-y comprisedthe establishment  of a monoply by privaoe treaty, hut underthe scheme now proposed by mc  a monoply could be avoidedby leasing tne Crown rights over different areas todifferent firmsCOLONIAL OPPICE.       20th July,  1917.
