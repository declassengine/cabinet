DRW/Oil.                 WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. XI.                        (July 25, 1917).  he Reform Bill and the Cabinet Crisis.     After a long discussion in the Chamber of Deputies  the Bill embodying the proposed franchise and agrarian reforms was put to the vote on June 29.   During ths previous six weeks and especially! since the re-opening *f the debate on June 2, there had  been very acrimonious discussions of the Governments action in the past and its present attitude.  In this the leaders of the new Labour Party, especially Mr Diamandy and Dr Lupu, had taken a leading part. The publication of this party&apos;s programme had been prevented by %he Government, as Mr Bratianu maintained that there was  no  need of any new Labour Party in Rumania, inasmuch as his party (the  National Liberal) had always championed the cause of democracy and reform. Some details of the Labour party1s programme have, however, now come to hand.  Its composition is a mixed one.  It contains a certain number of Liberals discontented, for genuine party reasons or for merely personal ones, with Mr Bratianu&apos;s regime, and.this gave rise to the suspicion (set forth at length in Weekly Report No. 8) that the new movement might, after all, be only a ruse on the part of Mr Bratianu to obstruct the reforms which he is ostensibly championing, but certai nly cannot view with any great enthusiasm. In the Chamber Mr Bratianu made an interesting appeal to these Liberal dissidents to return to the party-fold, but without much success.     This element, however, is not the chief one in the new party. Its leaders are genuinely Inspired by the new democratic hopes aroused by the Russian Revolution.  Mr Diamandy in his opening
speech declared definitely for a reform of the abuses rifeunder the old regime;  for a partition of the land satisfyingall the requirements of the peasants;  for an admission of womento a share in the municipal administration5  and, in general,for a completely democratic orientation of the Government of thecountry.  He and his followers expressed their discontent withthe fact that the only representative of Rumanian Labour at thepresent moment was a man like Rakovski, the Rumanian Socialistof Bulgarian origin who was liberated by Russian troops fromimprisonment on May 1, and had since been hobnobbing with theRussian Maximalist Socialists in different Russian towns.  The.Labour Party, unlike Mr Rakovski, pronounced themselves infavour of the energetic conduct of the war until final victoryover the Autocracies of Central Europe was achieved.   Theydeclared that they would not vote for Bratianu&apos;s reforms, bothbecause they were inadequate and above all because they could notgive any measure of confidence in, or appro val of, the corruptand partisan administration of which he was the head.   Theposition, therefore, became very critical, and in view both of theattitude of the Labour Party and other deputies discontented withMr Bratianu on the one hand, and of the Germanophil ultra-Conservative elements in the Senate on the other, it seemed verydoubtful if the reforms would be carried.     There seems no doubt at all that it was the action ofMr Take Ionescu which solved the difficulty.   He assuredMr Bratianu of his full support and that of the Conservativesassociated with him until the reforms had been carried, afterwhich he would re-aseert his liberty of action.
a.     On June 29,  accordingly,  the Chamber passed the proposedBill by a majority of 130 to 14x(with 1 abstention).   Threedays later the  Senate passed the Bill almost unanimously (79 votesout of 84),  the necessary quorom having been obtained after some          xxdifficulty.     On the following day, however, a vote of fullconfidence in the past and future administration of Mr Bratianuwas proposed in the Senate at the instigation of the Prime Ministeror of hie supporters and carried, and this vote so seriouslyconflicted with the national character of the Coalition Governmentthat it precipitated the inevitable resignation of Mr Take Ionescuand his supporters.   Accordingly, on July 7, Mr Take Ionescu,together with Mr  Mihai Cantacuzino (Minister of Justice),Mr Greceanu (Minister of Commerce), end Dr Istrati (Krister ofPublic Works),  resigned from the Government.  The terms on whichMr Take Ionescu offered the5 King to participate in the reconstructionof the Cabinet  were:     (1) Lhat Mr  Bratianu should take either (but not both) the postof Pri?Tie Minister or Minister of Foreign Affairs (as the combinationx    The  14 who voted against the Bill were:-   10  Labourites;  2 -     Conservatives  (Nicolae Ghica-Comanesti  and Krupenski);   the     Conservative-Democrat Cinciu;   and  the  extreme  anti-Semitic     &quot;Nationalist&quot;  Cuza.  These  deputies declared  that  they  voted     against  the reforms, not because they considered them un-     neceesary, but because they considered  the Government had     introduced them not  in good faith but as  a party move cal-     culated  to deceive public opinion.   Two other deputies  (the     free-lance Mills and the Conservative Matei Cantacuzino),     though holding these views, yet felt bound to vote for  the     reforms  as indispensable to the welfare of the  country.xx  The elaboration of the reforms into amendments of the    Constitution (clauses 19,57 and 67 of which are affected) has    been entrusted to a special Commission, which begins its work    in August.   Parliament is prorogued sine die.
                           A                           &apos;  .of these two offices in one hand made it impossible for theConservatives to exercise any real influence on the conduct ofaffairs);  and that the post unselected by Mr Bratianu shouldbe assigned to Mr Take Ionescu;     (2) that Mr Vintila Bratianu (Minister of War and brotherof the Prime Minister) and Mr Con&amp;tantinescu (Minister of theInterior)  - both of whom have extremely shady reputations inconnection with financial deals  - should be excluded from thereconstructed Government;     (3) that the national character of this Government should beshown by an equal distribution of portfolios between the Liberaland Conservative Parties and  by the admission to the Cabinet ofprominent  patriotic citizens  (including members of the newLabour Party and some of the  Transilvanian leaders) who are freefrom the old party connections.     Mr Bratianu refused to agree to these terms, when they werecommunicated to him by the King.  The King was in the position ofnot wishing to part with Mr Bratianu but yet strongly desiring areally National Government.  As, however, Mr Bratianu definitelyrefuses Mr Take Ionescu1 s demands, there can be no question of theformation of this Cabinet. The  latest telegrams to hand seem toshow that, this being the case,  the King has decided to continuehis confidence in Mr Bratianu, who will, therefore, presumablyform what will be in name, as it is already in fact, a partisanGovernment.     This  can only be described  as a most unsettled state ofaffairs.  Mfr Bratianu1s party, and especially come of its leadingmambers, are so associated with the abuses and corruption of theold system that it is impossible for them to build up a genuinenew Rumania on the linos of the  proposed reforms.  Mr Bratianu,
both as a person and as a party politician, is not the man whowill ever be likely to succeed, or indeed to try to fit himselfinto the new democratic current which has been made so strongby the Russian Revolution.  So far as he has war aims they are,when not personal or party ones, merely narrowly Rumanian, andhe seems to show no recognition of the fact that the futureof an enlarged and democratic  Rumania could only be in friendlyassociated&apos;with the neighbouring States of Russia and Serbia.In the event of the victory of the Entente Powers it is hard toimagine that Mr Bratianu has any chance of retaining his controlof affairs, as he has up till  the present.  The strength ofhis position is that:     (1) the King relies on him as a Minister to whom he hasgrown accustomed, whereas he is personally distrustful of MrTake Ionescu aid the Radical elements with which he may associate;     (2) Mr Bratianu is the only possible Prime Minister who canat once declare himself strongly in favour of an alliance with theEntente powers and at the same time keep the country in such aposition that, in the event of a drawn war, a rapprochementwith Germany, on the old terms of commercial alliance, isfeasible.It may be conjectured that Mr  Bratianu1s representative at theParis Conference (Mr Lahovary, Minister in Paris), if, as Ihear, he will be advised by General Iliescu (Mr Bratianu&apos;sdiscredited supporter), is unlikely to meet with much approvalon the part of the Russian and Serbian delegates.Rumanian Irredenta.     There are something like  150,000 Rumanian subjects of wAustria-Hungary now prisoners  in Russia, many of them havingbeen captured at Przemyel and  other places on the Galician
front.   News comes from Iasi that some 80,000 of these havevolunteered for service with the Rumanian Army.  A Committee of250 officers and 250 non-commissioned officers and men, represent-ing 126^000 Ruman soldiers,  some weeks ago addressed a requestto the  Russian Provisional Government to allow these men togo to Rumania and join the Rumanian forces.  Many difficultieswere raised on the side of the Russians, particularly on theground  that labour conditions in Russia did not allow of this,but these difficulties have to a large extent been overcome,and it  is to the credit of Mr Octavian Goga and other enthusiasticdelegates from Rumania Irredenta that the new movement has caughton among these Rumanian prisoners.  Recently a first draft,numbering 150 officers and 1,300 men, arrived in lasi and took theoath of allegiance to King Ferdinand as volunteers in the RumanianArmy.     Similarly there is considerable ferment in Bessarabia amongthe Rumanian or so-called &quot;Moldavian&quot; population.  During the pastthree months the national movement ha3 attained considerabledimensions.  A National Moldavian Committee has been chosenfollowing on the lines of the Ukrainian Council, with whom theyare in  close contact.  Their demands embrace ecclesiasticalautonomy for Moldavia;  self-government and the use of theRumanian language in the province;  a fairer distribution of theland anong the Moldavian peasants;  the right of Bessarabians todo their military service in Bessarabia and that they should forma separate army unit following the lines of the Ukrainian demand;the prohibition of foreign colonisation of the province;  theexpenditure on the province of revenue raised in the province;
and the assurance of reciprocal religious, political and economicrights for Bescarabians out of Bessarabia and non-Bessarabiansin Bessarabia.   So far there seems to be no sign that theseBessarabian Nationalists are aixious for incorporation in theKingdom of Rumania.   The explanation is, of course, that theydistrust the present regime in Rumania and, being in the mainpeasants,  have  far more hope of good treatment by the RussianRevolutionary Government than by the Rumanian Government, which,as they see, has not yot been reformed and modernised.   Theinstallation of a completely democratic regime in Rumania wouldalmost certainly exercise a magnetic effect on the Bessarabians,but till this takes  place it is hardly likely that they will beattracted to Rumania.
