SECRET.G.T. 1517. .                       WAR CABIHST.          FUTURE. STATUS j. 05* THE MERCANTILE MARIKE.                Note by ,,the Secretary.      With reference to the following letter from the Shipping Controller, I understand that he is asking the Shipping Organisations to place at his disposal  their entire staffsj offices,  wharfage,  lighters, mechanical appliances and all other loading and discharging facilities; in fact, the whole of their personnel and materiel, both at home and abroad.                                          (Intd.) M.P.A.H. 2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.     26th July,  1917.       Copy of letter Ko,61952, dated 35th July 1917, from the       Secretary, Ministry of Shipping to the Secretary, War Cabinet.         Sir,              I am directed by. the Shipping Controller to thank you         for your letter 12/K/22 of the 17th instant, and to say that         he thinks that his purpose in submitting Lord Inchcape^e G.T.    letter of the 6th Juiy^to the War Cabinet has been to some07.         extent misapprehended.              Sir Joseph Maclay fully recognises that it would not         be reasonable ox proper to ask the War Cabinet to bind them-         selves by a definite undertaking not to entertain any pro-.         posal for maintaining&apos;Government control over shipping after         peace conditions have been restored.  A3 it appeared to him         that the phraseology used in Lord Inchcape&apos;s letter might         conceivably lend itself to such an interpretation,  Sir Joseph
took the precaution of seeing Lord Inchcape before sendingany communication to the War Cabinet.  Paragraph 2 of thememorandum of 11th July was the result of this inter-view.  It is there made clear that all that Lord Inchcapeand hia colleagues ask for ia an assurance that *it is notintended that shipping should be nationalised after thewarw.  This means no more than it states.  Expressed inother words,  it is a request for an- assurance that theaction of. this. Ministry in now calling upon the-establishedlines to place not merely, their ships but the whole of  -  .their vast organizations at home and abroad unreservedlyat the disposal.of the Governmentj is not a conscious stepin the direction of nationalisation after the war.    , Sir Joseph Maclay,  knowing the facts of the caseas he does,  is well aware that such an assurance could begiven with perfect truth; but, having regard to theposition of this Ministry,  he thought it advisable toobtain the specific authority.of the War Cabinet beforemaking any reply to Lord I nchc ape1 s letter..  He now awaitstheir directions in the matter.                                 I am,  etc.,                                   (Sd.)   JOHN ANDERS OH.
