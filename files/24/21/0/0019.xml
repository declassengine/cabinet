SECRET.V5 aIntelligence flureau.Department of, Information,     F.F.w/008.           T7HEKLY  REPORT  OH   FRAMCE.   VIII                      July  26th,  19&amp;7.   There is not much  in the way of  actual occurrences to reportthis week.   The chief events are the  secret and public debate inthe Senate, the reapoearpnce at  the  Tribune of M. Caillaux and there-opening of the Stockholm question.    None of them ere of thefirst importance:  of  less  importance,  perhaps,  all of them, thanan attempt which has been going  on  under the surface in Socialistcircles to force M. Thomas  to resign.    Many of the Socialistdeputies have long objected to his presence in aCsbinet which hasalready once prevented the:^ from carrying out their deolared intentionof going to Stockholm  and may very possibly commit the same crimeagain.   And they may  have  not liked his being forced to explainaway his concessions to the Russians about the question of a plebis-cite as to Alsace-Lorraine.   M.  Ribot has emphatically stated that&quot;in the view of the Government in which M. Thomas concurs&quot;, therestoration of Alsace-Lorraine is France&apos;s inalienable right and thatno plebiscite oan be admitted -  But, whatever/actually occurred inthe Socialist councils, it  is \:no\m  that, for the present at anyrate, the difficulty has been n-ot over and M.  Thomrs remainsMinister of Munitions.   But to return to our three events.    The first of them, thesilting of the Senate, web  chiefly remarkable for an attempt onthe part of M. Clamenceau to bet rid of another Minisr/er,  M. Malvy -M. Malvy is the only Minister who has  retained office throughout theter*   He is Minister  of the Interior  and it is  alleged that a large
ofjnumber of Deputies owe their seats to his manipulations and thatthey in return keep him in office.   His friends are largely thefriends of M.  Caillaux whose agent in the Cabinet he is supposedto be.   And like so many fo that group he has a reputation bothprivate and public  which is not much to be envied.    But in spite of fill this,  in s ^ite of M.  Ciemenceau&apos;s vigourand eloquence r. nd the astonishing stories he  told, in s-nite of aparticularly damaging attack connecting M. Maltfy with Almereyda theeditor cf the Bonnet Rouge (the pa^er, now suppressed, one of whosestaff was lately arrested with a large foreign cheque on him) theattack must be admitted to have failed.    So  far ss a foreigner canjudge from newspaper reports,  M.  Malvy made a fairly strong defence.The gist of the accusation was that he had been weak in dealing withsuspects,  pacifists and other dangerous persons, all through the war.His reply is that if he had taken the advice  of the soldiers at thebeginning and arrested&apos; all suspects he would  have had France dividedagainst herself.    As it was he decided to trust to the feeling ofthe country and he claimed to be judged by the result.   Little orno crime had occurred,  and the country had remained one.    It must be admitted that the order and freedom from strikes whichhas on the whole characterised France throughout these terrible yearsis a strong point in favour of M.  Maivy,    He was on weaker groundon the question of the pacifist agitation and seems,  judging by Vieabbreviated reports,  to have said lees about  it.   The truth is that                                      sall the sounder opinion in the country has been sacndalised by theapparent ease and vast scale of its operations.    Everybody asks howit came about that this has  all gone on under the eyes of the Ministerof the Interior.    The recent awakening of the country to the dangerhas not been favourable to Iff.  Malvy and M. Clemenceau&apos;s revelations
 as to  his  refusal  to  act  in  certain cases  did not improve the Minister&apos;s nosition.    But M.  Hibot came to  his rescue and cleared the  air by the  eloquence  of  his  denunciations of the pacifist- agitators,  among whom he  openly  said the  hand of Germany was at work,  and  the vigour  of his  undertaking that it should be repressed without mercy.   The  result  was  an unanimous acceptance of the Government Order of the Day  -  which is  at least a respite for M. Malvy,  though there is no doubt  that he has  not heard the last of M. Clemenceau;  and some well-informed people think that he may yet fall a victim to that dangerous  veteran -     &amp;  natter more  important  to us  than  the standing or falling of M.Malvy was only just mentioned  in the  public debate of the Senate. M. Ribot in his peroration,  said that if certain things were done France would not be conquered.   One of them was the extension of the  British front, allusion  to rhlch is again made in the Order of the  Day as it was  in  that adopted  by the Chamber a fortnight ago. This is of course  not the place  to express any opinion on the possibility or  wisdom of  agreeing  to this  request.    But two things may  be noted about it.   One is  that it is not believed that It. Painleve hcd the honesty or  courage to  explain to the ignorant Deputies and Senators that if  men  are more numerous  on our part of the line it is chiefly because they  have more  Germans to  face,    Jew French statesmen ever show any inclination to  interfere with their countrymen when they  are engaged in the pleasant task of seeing them- eelves in  the beau role - The  most generous  acknowledgement has  again and  again  been  made by English statesmen of  the services Prance  has rendered to the common cause.    But these  acknowledgements  have  too often  been merely  registered as  the admission  of a debt,  not as  an incentive  to a  generous rivalry  in gratitude or an enquiry  how much
prance owes to  England.    Not one Frenchman in a thousand at this dayknows that hut  for the British Kavy the war would have been over sofar as France is concerned in a few weeks.   The French know nextto nothing of the financial support we have given them or of theimmense benefit they have derived from our industrial effort.   M.Ribot has always refused to allow them to be told of the sacrifices-made by the British tax-payer .   So again they are going to be keptwarm t is winter by British coal  sent to them at the expense of theBritish consimer, whose supply of coal for his own use is about to berationed.    Yet the accounts of this in the French papers lay no stressat all on our generosity,  and the writers certainly never ask them-selves whether  a French Minister  would ever have wished or dared  toration Frenchmen in coal or anything else in order to save English-men inconvenience.    It is natural no doubt that Frenchmen should notlike to cay too much about the extent of their dependence upon England.But thoy ought to be unwilling to owe us so much and acknowledge tliedebt so little.   In any case Ministers who know the facts might beexpected at once to resent and contradict any such suggestions asthat made in the two debates, th-it we are not taking our share of themilitary burden, and ought to make the most public and generous ac-kn owl edge merit of it, if we decide to occupy a larger part of the front.They ought not to need any asking:  they should be anxious to do iton their own account.    But this  has not been the case in the past.Our previous extensions have been allowed to pasn almost unnoticed.    The second of the three events of the week is the reapnearanceof M. Caillaux who has m^de two speeches,  one in the Chamber v*here hehas not spoken during the war,  and one in his Constituency.    It isdifficult to be sure what this means.   Is it that he feels strongenough to bid for power again?   Is it that having Inaugurated his
campaign by founding newspapers and a Republican league andnot having had the  very best luck with either,  he felt obligedto wt a bold face  on it,  at the risk of sinking deeper into dis-credit?   One cannot be certain.    He seems to  have been rather ner-vous at first in the Trubune and to have been listened to withcuriosity and interest but without enthusiasm)!   Hia speech - orr&amp;ther speeches,  for there were two - in the Chamber were on theBudget,  on which subject he is an acknowledged expert.   The firstauccessfully opposed the levy of a small direct tax on a largenumber of people of small  means.    So far he delighted his naturalfriends of the extreme Left.    But he seems to have aimed at creatingan impression of moderation in thi3 hie first reappearance.   So thesecond speech was in support of the Government who were resisting anamendment intended  to introduce the system of compulsary returns ofincome and the power to check them, a system peculiarly unpopularin France,  and particularly in the Senate.   The same caution may beobserved in his speech to  his Constituents in which he touched oninternational questions, denouncing a &apos;hypocritical and inseoure peace,without guarantees1 but saying nothing specific of the claimo ofBelgium, Serbia,  or indeed any country but his own, and laying greatstress on the necessity of the peace being of the sort that is thenatural development of the idea of the French Revolution.   The speechis vague and rhetorical, but except for its omissions quite irreproaoh-able, and it may be noted  that his paper Le Pays ha3 lately taken abetter tone, publishing several articles on holding out and declaringthe intentions of the Allies to &quot;ipvosji&quot; peace, such a peace as bo &quot;Siin the military and commaroial field will give them security.   Stillwith the writers of Le Pays as with M. Caillaux, and indeed with betterFrenchmen then either, there is a decMed absenoc of reference to anyinterests except those of  Prance and the theoretic Society of Nations
                              6. which he hopes to established in the future.   For  the moment^-the- ..... only moral of all this is the necessity of &quot;keeping  a  watchful eye on M.Caillaux and his clique,  To us, no doubt, when he  pours  out a burst of rhetoriS about the Idaal and the Right his past  makes him more ridiculous than impressive.   But it has always  been at  once the irtrrength--and weakness of his oountrymen to be so susceptible  to great ideas that they are rather apt to find them in  orators  who reallyposess nothing but great phrases.   ^nd M. Caillaux  will work on this weakness as on all others for his purposes.   For the present there does not appear to be any immediate danger from him.    But like (Uolitti he is always behind the scenes, and if  ever either of them should be given a leading part in the national drama,  we in England may expect preparations for a bad and particularly  an anti- English peace.     Of the third matter I mentioned, the revived Stockholm  question, there is as yet very little to be said.   The Socialists  obviously wish to go, though the Humanite plainly says that there is  no question of going except on the condition that no ona ia invited to  it who does not admit the right of nations to dispose of themselves.    They acknowledge that this formula io a dangerously loose  safeguard and are aware that by going they would seriously wound  an important part of French opinion ancsf that this places them in what they  call a pain- ful dilemma.   But they plead the necesoity of conciliating the Russians.   Meanwhilf the Government is believed, and the Senrte  is                                                       4 known to be strongly opposed to granting them passports.    And there the matter must be left at least till after the Allied Socialist Congress which is to take piece in London in August.      Among minor recent events may be mentioned the great success0 which II. Louchem the Minister who is dealing with the coal  question
 ppears  to  have had in the  Chamber and with public opinion.   Part of      doubt he ov/ed to the  great generosity of the British Governmentin the arrangements he was  able to announce - not that he said a greatdeal about  that -  for  if  he had not been able to announce that theParisians would have coal this  winter,  the eloquence of Cicero would  t have made his  speeches  a success.    But the praise he won was notentirely duo to his good  news,  nor at all to his eloquence.   ^at allunite in praising  was  his note  of practical good sense, and as hispraisctc include papers which so seldom agree as the Debats and thepays he  may be counted a  happy  man,    But  the man of the moment ie unboubtedly M.  Painleve.   In theSecret Session both of the  Chamber rni  of the Senate his personalsuccess, was according to private reports of those who were present, byfar the  most striking  feature.   &apos; Ee was able to  clear himself fromresponsibility for the fatal Offensive,  and in the Senate he alsoindignantly defended M. Poincare,  who he said had merely presided atthe Council and in no  way influenced the decision to make an Offensive.The Senate  had known little of  M.  Painleve before and is said to havebeen a little suspicious  of him.   But his speeches won universal praise,and,  more than his speeches,  the impression he made as a man of actionand character.  Perhaps also it did him good with the patriotic majority    inthat/his speech in the Chamber,  when he was attacking the Pacifist agi-tators,  he  looked  markedly  at M.  Caillaux who did not relish this atten-tion.  Perhaps he  may  bo  the man of the future as well as the man of themoment.   Some close observers  among the Deputies think that if M.  Ribotfalls, as is thought may  happen before  long,  the President would send forH.  Painleve.   But M.  Viviani is known  to expect to return to the Premiership and Jj, Painleve/may  perhaps be  considered by the President to havetoo little  political experience.                                                        *7.
