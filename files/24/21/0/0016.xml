Military Secret.674            From Viceroy, Army Department, 2ith July 1917.  -                        (Received 25th, 10 a.m.)   *     o.  (?).  Your telegram of the 21st instant,  1578.   Decision of His   jesty&apos;s Government has been noted.   1. We understand that transfer of control of military operations to theWar Office will place Aden on  the same basis as Mesopotamia.  We see nodrawback to this, provided the present procedure as  regards control ofoperations and administration in Mesopotamia is adhered to.   2. As regards transfer  of political  control,  we  have  already agreed inprinciple.   But we earnestly trust that this will not involve any departurefrom our traditional  policy in Southern Arabia which we venture  to claimhas proved surprisingly successful.  It should be remembered, further, thatResident at Aden is  not  a trained Political Officer, and  that he cannot beregarded as fully conversant with that policy, which has  been the  result ofclose supervision from here.   3. It should further be  realised  that under  the new political system we.shall not have the same assurance as in the  case of  Mesopotamia that Indianinterests are considered, and that operations are not undertaken which willimpose such a strain  upon our  military resources as to cripple our  efforts tomeet our military obligations in India and elsewhere.   4. We request that  adequate notice be given  of special  demands fromAden of men and materials.   5. We assume that for defence measures and administration the  defendedPort of Aden is included  in Aden sphere under War Office control.   C. Jacob&apos;s appointment is agreed to.
