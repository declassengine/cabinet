FROM BRIGADIER-GENERA.!. A.  KNOX Military Attache.                       SUBJECT-SOUTH-WEST  FRONT.                                                    , British Embassy,                                                             Petrograd, Sir,                         .                                   10th July, 1917.     I have the honour to submit some notes collected during  my recent visit to the South-West Front.&quot;                           .  \    -  .    ^     The operations. It was decided some months since that the main offensive of the year  should take place on the South-West Front, and that  this stroke should be accompanied or succeeded  by minor offensives on the other fronts.     The section selected  for the main  attack was from Presovtse to south-west of Trostsyanitse,  altogether  25  miles, of which 13 north of Kuropatniki lie in the area of the 1.1th Army and, 15  south of that village are in the area  of the 7th Army.   The section was  selected because the railway communications  were comparatively good, and the configuration of  the ground  afforded opportunities for observation arid the employment of flanking fire.     1. The plan waS briefly td  gain the bank of the Zolota Lipa river, and then to wheel north-wes t and advance on Lemberg.     Two subsidiary offensives Were also arranged on the South-West Front-     (a.) By the Yth Siberian Corps on a narrow front  in the neighbourhood of Tatkuv-(18 miles south of Brodi).   .This movement was to be  supported by the 6th Grenadier Division from the Special Army, and has been delayed by the disinclination of that Division to tight.,     (5. j By the Xllth Dorps in the 8th Army west of Mariaihpol.     The object of  the two  subsidiary offensives was&apos; to  hold the.  enemy in their immediate front.  The XHth Corps section was  selected because the Austrians ih its front had more than once  pressed the Russians to attack  quickly before  the Germans should arrive and Force them  to fight:     2. The. Staff of the Front did not disguise  the fact that a great success was most unlikely:   We had  concentrated a great superiority in bayonets and, for the first time ih the war, ih guns  and aeroplanes, btit  the  moral of the infantry was  bad, divisions averaged about 2,000 short bf establishment; there were no  reserves worth counting in rear and such drafts that  trickled to tlie front arrived  undisciplined  and utitrained and decked out with silly banners like a Chinese army.     3. The enemy had long known of our selection of this area, but he  did not imagine till the 23rd June, that we had  serious intentions of attacking.   Information given by deserters enabled him to follow every move:  For instance, it was necessary to relieve the Guard Corps to concentrate them in reserve of the  Striking Force.  The day after the relieving corps, the 1st Turkistan, took their place  ih the line, a non-commissioned officer and private went over to the  Gerihah trenches and  returned  two hours later drunk and with supplies of cognac and propaganda literature.   Ah officer ordered his men to fire on them as they staggered back, but the men refused. Enemy spies passed freely backwards  and  forwards  through the  lines  of the  XXXIVth Corps, whose commander told me it was the worst ih the army.  It was wished to concentrate  at night, but many units refused to march except in the day:     There were  evidences of indiscipline everywhere^:  Every bivouac of a mounted unit was full of horsefs galloping backwards&quot; and forwards untied; every village full ofhorses tied up without food ih the sun for hours while their owners slept or attendedmeetings.  No one seemed to do  a full  days  work  except  the company  cooks.   Theroads hear the front Were ih a disgraceful State and ho One made ah attempt to repair    (B17/489) 20 7/17 H&amp;S 4853wo
  them, while  the  men spent the day in bathing and in lying drying in the  sun.  No  observation post that I  saw was properly defended and many of them were  not even  properly concealed.  Most of the mechanical transport was handed over to &quot; delegates,&quot;  who seem now to have priority over the staff and the service of supply.      4. Most  of the  staffs  were  changed  a short  time  before  the action.    The  Commander-iu-Chief, Brusilov, left  for Mogilev three weeks before  the  attack.   The  Commander of the 11th Army was changed twice in the past three months, and the  present commander, Erdeli, arrived  five days before the offensive.  His Chief of Staff,  Gerois, had  come  to the  Army two  months  earlier and his General Quartermaster  arrived about ten days before the attack.   Both the Commander and the Chief of Staff  of the 7th Army were transferred to the Staff of the Boumanian Front in April.  All  the  corps commanders and most of the divisional commanders had  been changed  in the  past three months.      However, all the regular officers that have survived  the war and revolution  worked heroically to stem the tide of socialistic cowardice and to restore order  out of  chaos.      Apart from specialist detachments, mustering over  50,000 men,  the  231- infantry  divisions of the corps in front line had 174,701 bayonets  in the companies against, as far  as we know, at the commencement of the operation, 18 German battalions, 48 Austrian  and 12 Turkish.      5. The guns in  the Striking. Force were, according to the Bussian system of  classification:            693 light field guns, as opposed to 284 enemy guns.              84 light howitzers, as onposed to 178 enemy guns.            337 heavy guns and howitzers, as opposed to 66 enemy guns.      The 11th Army had about 50 aeroplanes and the 7th Army  70, including 6 Ilya  Muromets, large aeroplanes.      With the idea of encouraging  the men,  General Gutor, Commander of South-West  Front, moved the staff of the front forward to Kozova, 7 miles from the German trenches,  and ordered the staff of the 11th Army to move from Kremenets to Eserna and that of the  7th  Army from Buchach to Talyache.   The news of these moves nearly caused a panic  amongst the corps  commanders before the action commenced.  They feared  constant  interference.   As a matter of fact, Gutor, who  had gone into minute details before the  action commenced, did not interfere with dispositions during the action itself.      The operations were postponed two days to allow of the  arrival  of the Minister of  War, who brought with him  the proclamation of the All Bussia  Council of Working  Men and Soldiers&apos; Deputies calling  on the troops to take the  offensive.  Kerenski spent  his  first day in the 11th  Army and  had a  bad reception in the 2nd  Guard  Infantry  Division, half of the men of which refused to give him a hearing.   No  one really knew  whether the infantry would attack, few of the units were actively mutinous, but almost  every division had one bad regiment.   The cavalry and artillery were sound.      The  subordinate inspectors of artillery wanted  to destroy the  enemy&apos;s  first  line  trench by five hours&apos; fire and then to attack, but this proposal was overruled  by the  Commander-in-Chief on the suggestion of a young captain of the French  artillery.  It  was finally arranged that the  XLIst Corps and the 11th Army should commence their  artillery preparation at daylight on the 29th June and the other corps of the 7th Army   Vllth Siberian, XXXIVth and XXIInd at daylight on the 30th.   The attack was to  be launched at 10 a.m. on the  1st July.      The guns destroyed the enemys wire and all the defences in his first fortified zone.      The  35th Division,  the 4th  Finland  Division  and the Czech-Slovak Brigade  postponed their attack till the morning of the 2nd.      The infantry, with the exception of some few regiments, commenced well.      The Vlth Corps took the enemy&apos;s first three lines of trench in 20 minutes practically  without loss.   The  village of Konyukhi was occupied by the 2nd Finland Division,  but  as liquor was found there the  other divisions were held back. General  Maimaievski,  the  commander of the 4th Division, marched to  the attack at its head.      6. Progress, however, was much interfered  with by the  indiscipline and  stupidity  of the mem  The left regiment of the 16th Division had been allotted  a  passive task.i  On the first day of the preparation its committee told the  Divisional  Commander that  the  regiment refused to  move because only two passages through the wire had been  prepared for it, while the neighbouring regiment had eight.   To please these men, on  the  second day of preparation many rounds had  to be-wasted on destroying wire that  would otherwise have  been  used  against  the enemys trenches, and the  regiment  suffered  heavily in consequence.  Further to  the right  the 24th  Begiment of  the
 6th Finland Division refused to attack, and so exposed the 6th and  8th Begirnents of the  2nd Finland Division to heavy  counter-attacks, in  which they  lost 25  and 30 officers respectively.           . \     .      .....     In the 7th Army all the divisions that had been allotted  an active task  occupied the enemy&apos;s trenches as far as these had been destroyed by fire, but, with the exception of the divisions of the Vllth  Siberian  Corps; showed  little  inclination to press any farther.          .  -    -     The observation posts were  crowded by correspondents, army delegates  and idle soldier spectators who hampered the officers at work.     7. At 2 p.m. I  went to the headquarters of the 7th Army where I sat in the General Quartermasters, room and got; a  genera] idea of progress.  All were then in good spirits, but from 3 p.m. the picture began to change.     The 74th Division was making no progress and complained of heavy gun  fire from its left.   The Commander-in-Chief, who was with Kerenski, telephoned that many men of this Division were streaming to the rear, and ordered that all available delegates be despatched at  once  to hearten them.  The &quot; delegate&quot;  is now looked upon as the universal panacea, hut he is not half so effective as were the subalterns boot and fist in former times.  As a matter of fact, I heard; later from a French officer that the fire the 74th Division complained of was never very heavy.    The composite Siberian  Division was reinforced by the  108th and continued to make progress.    Skoropadski, the Commander of the XXXIVth Corps, soon began shrieking  for help.  Two regiments  of  the 19th Siberian Division had  reached  the second line of German trench, but the other two regiments could not b.: brought up as the ground was open. ,The  23rd Division  had three regiments already in line, and was suffering heavily from the  German fire.   He feared a counter-attack.  The 153rd Division had so many men down with scurvy that  only 40 rifles  per company were left.  At 4 p.m. he telephoned that he had two German divisions against him as he had taken prisoners from the  15th  German  Beserve Division,  and also  from  the 24th German BeserveDivision.  As a matter of fact,-these  two  divisions were  not only holding  up  his four divisions but also the two divisions of the Vllth Siberian Corps and one division of theXLIst Corps.    8. Skoropadski proposed that  his Corps should be  relieved that night by theHnd Guard Corps, and the Army Staff recommended  this  course to the front on the ground that it was necessary to restore confidence at the outset of the operation. - -    By 5.30 p.m. the XXXIVth  Corps had been driven back  by counter-attack to its Original trenches.          - - - -  ;                     ;    The XXIInd Corps on the left shared the  same fate.   At first all three  divisions made good progress and especially the 1st Finland in the centre.  The 5th  Finland Division of the right captured two lines  of German trench, but was driven back by a counter-attack and the other two  divisions retired in turn.    To sum up--by 6 p.m. on the 1st July all the Bussian units, with the exception of the Vlth Corps and  the Vllth  Siberian  Corps, had retired to  their original trenches. The  Vllth Siberian Corps held  on to the ground it hadgained for some 48 hours more and then too retired.  A few  gas shells caused a panic in the 3rd Trans-Amur and 74th Divisions, but officers generally  tried to ascribe  the  retirement  to counter-attacks.  It leaked out later  that the counter-attacks, where indeed they took place, were very weak.  The enemy&apos;s fire Was never heavy, and the Bussian artillery worked throughout under practice camp conditions.    9. The retirement can only be explained by the miserable moral  of the infantry. The men were impressed by an  artillery fire to which they had been little  accustomed and they went as far as the enemy&apos;s trenches had been destroyed.   They  had lost&apos; many of their officers and had no incentive to further effort; in fact, they knew that further progress would be attended  by risk, while they  could retire  without fear of being punished.  To dig themselves in was  too  much trouble, so they went  back to their old ready-made defences.    The Army Staffs gave me the following list of prisoners captured on the first day :                                                      Officers.   ;  Rank and file.         Germans ...    ............... - 197         1,444         Austrians...    ...     ...    .........               8,587         Turks......     .........    ...    &apos;             191                                     5  guns.                  &apos;&apos;     The 81st Czech Begiment surrendered en bloc to the Vlth Corps and the next day marched to the rear through Tarnopol headed by its band.     (4853)
     The Bussian losses were given officially two days later-17,339 killed, wounded andmissing.     As,  counting  specialist  detachments,  about  160,000  bayonets must have beenengaged, the losses suffered cannot be considered  sufficient cause for the retirement inthe 7 th Army.   It is possible, too, that even these figures are exaggerated, and it isprobable that a large number of men hid in the woods and only returned when they gotvery hungry and were very  sure  that the fighting was over.  The Chief of MilitaryCommunications of the South-West Front superintended the evacuation of the woundedfrom Kozova on the  1st July.  He states that in a train of 850 cases he considers thatonly some 15 men were really wounded; the remainder were wounded in the hands, andhe suspected that many of the wounds were self-inflicted.     On the night of the 1st July the 19th Siberian and 23rd Divisions of the XXXIVthCorps and the  Corps Staff were withdrawn on relief by the  Hnd Guard  Corps.   Theunits of the XLIst Corps gave it to be understood that they would not attack  again.The 7th Army has not moved since.     On the 2nd Julythe 11th Army continued its advance and the XLIXth  Corps inconjunction with the 35th Division made good progress.  Next day the commander ofthe  Corps  did  not  conceal his opinion that  he owed his success to the Czech-SlovakBrigade, and the list of captures supports this view.     It was  unfortunate that  Erdeli&apos;s reserve the 1st  Guard Corps was too far distantto develop  the  success.   The 2nd Division of this Corps is as bad as any in the BussianArmy and the  command was waiting the psychological moment to try to induce it tomove to the front.   The uncertain  state of the Corps has already limited  the success ofthe 1st July, for Erdeli had considered it necessary at the last moment on that morningto hold back the 151st Division as army reserve, and the commander of the Vlth Corpswas therefore left without weight to push his success.     Now simply on  account of the disaffection in this Corps  the whole advance of the11th Army had to stop on the 3rd, 4th and 5th.     10. I came to the conclusion on the 4th July that no further success could be hopedfor from the main offensive, but General Dukhonin, Chief of Staff,  South-West Front,maintained  that the  operation could be continued for  a fortnight more without  anyadditional strength.   He was  only doubtful whether  it would be the better  policy torenew the attack on the front of the 7th Army or to transfer  everything to  reinforcethe 11th.     Kerenski promoted Erdeli to be full general, forgetful of the fact that Gutor, theCommander-in-Chief, was still only  a lieutenant-general, and that it was to Gutor&apos;s workwhen commander of the 11th  Army and not to Erdeli, who arrived only five days beforethe offensive commenced, that any  success gained was  due.     Of course, the main cause of the failure was the low moral of the infantry, but thedirection of the artillery left much  to be desired.     There was  no proper liaison between the  artillery and the front line trenches.  Onthe night of the 1st July  at the instance of Captain Vagneux,  the  Chief of  the Staffordered that in  future an artillery officer must be attached to each regiment commanderand a non-commissioned officer to each battalion commander, with telephone and rocketsfor communication purposes.     1L For the first time in the war we had temporary command of the air, but theair service had not sufficiently practised working with  the batteries in order to establishmutual  confidence.    Several  of  the  battery  commanders  refused  to  trust  theobservations of the machines.     Our batteries destroyed the. enemys first defensive position very thoroughly evenmore thoroughly than was necessary.  It is possible that if they had distributed theirlire over a depth of 3 kilometres the Bussian infantry might have been encouraged to afurther advance.     Ten out of eleven Vickera howitzers  in the 11th Army went out of action on  thefirst and second days of the preparation after firing in all  900 rounds.   I  saw  thehowitzers.  The Inspector of  Artillery of the  Army and the officers  of the Divisionthink that the shell was not of the proper gauge and  blame the Bussian  inspection inEngland.  However,  none of the similar  howitzers in the 7th Army had suffered.   Itis very probable that  the 11th Army  was dealt  out shell for the  British Governmentpattern 8-inch howitzer.     Moral and discipline. Kerenski has appointed &quot; commissaries &quot; to each army toassist in the maintenance of discipline.  These men are all hall-marked revolutionaries.Most of them have spent several years in  penal servitude.  The commissary of  the 11thArmy was  6 years in Siberia; the one  in the  7th Army, Savenkov, was the chief
 organizer of the murder of the Grand Duke Serge  Alexandrovich, since  which he has lived in Switzerland-  They are both working with courage and in complete agreement with the Command to re-establish order.     The position of the regimental officer is still difficult.   There are said to be about .3,000 officers &quot;at the disposal&quot; of the Commander of the Kiev Military District.   Most of these men are badly required at the front, but they have been taken objection to for some trivial reason.  It can be  imagined that the  number of cadre officers serving in units is very small, aud the survivals are often more remarkable for tact than for energy.     I was struck by the terrible position of the officers in one of the Finland regiments visited.   They were mere boys who had just joined from the military schools.   They were all anxious to do their  best, but found themselves at once the object of wholly unmerited suspicion.     During some trench negotiations on the  Northern  Front recently some  German officers came over, and there was an informal discussion regarding the causes of the war. The Russian and German officers, of course, disagreed, but a Russian soldier said that he preferred the word of a German officer to that of a Russian one.  In taking leave the German  officers told the Russians that they were &quot; really sorry&quot; for  them, for  their *&apos; position was dreadful.&quot;     12. The Polish Division has been hastily filled by Catholic recruits from Volhinya and Podolya.  Its discipline is bad, and it refused for some weeks to go near the  front. Its commander, General Simon, though a Pole, asked to be transferred  to serve  with Russian troops, as he could &quot; do nothing  with  the Poles.&quot;  The division has now been weeded  out.   Company commanders  pointed out  to the Commissary  the  men  they wished to get  rid of.  For instance, one  company leader  said,  pointing out  one  of his men : &quot; One night on the march I mistook the road and led the company 40 yards out of its way.  I found out the mistake and led the company back.  I overheard this man say to the company :  &apos; Gentlemen, I suggest  that we throw this son of a pig into the river.&apos; &quot;     The Commander of the 1st Division of the  Guard  told me that his officers  were martyrs suffering daily tortures.  Some nights ago a  company  commander of the Yegerski Regiment was riding along with his  command when his men called to him through the darkness to get off,  as  they did not  see  why a &quot;bourgeois&quot;&apos; should ride when they walked.  When he dismounted the men  at once began to consider whether he had not better ride so as to be able the quicker to get them billets when they aiTived at their destination.   He mounted  again, and  they  again required him  to  dismount. This officer cannot have been much good, but after all he was only following the example set by his superiors  in yielding to the men in everything.     13. It is  impossible to avoid the uncomfortable conclusion that the war in Russiais coming more and more to be regarded  as a secondary matter.     In  a recent  speech at Kiev, Kerenski told his audience that the Constituent Assembly could not be summoned before October,  because  the people would be at work in  the fields.  It did  not occur to him  to  mention the  war which has  beensufficient to prevent all elections in a small country like England.     Prjevalski, the new Commander-in-Chief in the Caucasus, in taking leave of his corps committee thanked them for their co operation and told them they had two tasks before them in the future,  first the  preparation  of the army for the  ConstituentAssembly, and secondly the restoration of discipline.  This will  hardly be encouraging for Sir Stanley Maude.     General Klembovski, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Front, is reported I by several papers to have said in a recent speech  at Riga, that the present offensive fwas all important  because a winter campaign was impossible, and all the combatants I would soon begin negotiations for peace.                                      .        &apos;     14. Kerenski works hard as Minister of War, but his speciality is revolution, and, hedoes not yet altogether grasp that the only way to  cause revolution in Germany is to defeat her army  in the field.   Even at the  front, half his attention is directed to Stockholm.  On the 1st July three German prisoners, the first taken, were led past hisobservation post.  He sent to ask them-not what troops were  on their right and leftand rear what political party they belonged to  and whether  there would soon be a revolution in Germany.  They replied they did not belong to any political  party.  They did not know anything about the interior of Germany, but at the front where they had been all the war there was no sign of a revolution.     I was sitting  with  the General Quartermaster  of the  7th Army at Buchach the day before we moved up  to the front  for the offensive, when two members of the Petrograd Council of Working Men and Soldier Deputies were announced.   They had come to lecture on two themes, War and Peace and the Constituent Assembly.
     Ensign Kirilenko, an anti-war socialist, stated in a speech delivered , to the Com- mittee of the 11th  Army that he  had organized a plebiscite in the  13th Finland Kegiment regarding the course of action to be followed by Russia in three eventualities      (1.)  If the Allies abandoned all claim to annexations, but Germany did not.  .     (2.)  If both the Allies and Germany refused to abandon the idea of annexations.     (3.)  If the Allies refused to abandon the claim to annexations, but Germany  agreed&apos;          to do so.     The reply, he stated, was in each case &quot; war,&quot;  but in the third case  &quot; war against- the Allies.&quot;                                                .....  .     This man calmly contemplates war against the world and maintains that the worst that could befall Russia would be the loss of  the Caucasus, Finland, Siberia and Poland. He professed to believe in the existence of secret treaties between England and  Germany.     Most officers shudder at the idea of a fourth winter of war.  They often  quote- Hindenburg&apos;s remark about nerves, and  confess that Russian nerves has  been the first to give way.     General Erdeli, Commander of 11th Army, however, thinks that even if the present attempts at the offensive fail, the men will not mind sitting in their trenches throughout the winter, as long as they  know they will not be called upon to attack.     Kornilov told me that  he considered the offensive  the last chance,  and that the economic condition  of Russia and  the breakdown  of the railways  will  make the continuation  of the  war.  through  a fourth  winter  impossible.  The Report  of the American Railway Commission on these matters will be of interest.     L5.  The opinion of Ignatiev, who now commands the 1st Division  of the Infantry of the Guard, is worth quoting, for he is capable Land  generally a, cheery optimist.  He is younger brother of the Count Ignatiev, late  Minister of Education, and their  father was the Ambassador  at Constantinople.;     He considers that peace is essential for Russia, for if there is not peace soon  there will be a general  massacre. The prolongation of the  war  is  driving the country to economic  ruin.  From the very beginning the  peasants  had hated the  war which was only at first popular with the educated classes.   He said, &quot;If you were to go out into the square now,.and to announce that the war will end at once on the one condition that Nikolai Romanov return to  power, everyone would at once agree, and there would be no more talk of a democratic republic.&quot;   (I believe this is true.   The revolution has been a revolt against the burden of the war, and not a protest, as the English Press at first tried to pretend, against the half-hearted way in which the late Government prosecuted the war.)     I asked Ignatiev whether the reconsideration of the terms of peace would have any effect on  Russian public, opinion.   He said it  would  oh conscientious people, but the mass of the soldiery  only  wanted an excuse  for  saving their skin.   They  belonged neither to the party of the Bolsheviki  nor  to  that  of the  Mensheviki,  but  were *&quot; Skurniki &quot; pure and simple, i.e., &quot; fearers for their own skins.&quot;     I pointed  out that if by any chance Germany were  not beaten as she deserved it would  be  entirely Russia&apos;s; fault.  He agreed and said he  fully  expected that no foreigner would speak to a Russian for the next twenty years.   In England&apos;s place he would get out  of the war as  soon as possible while there was yet time.     On the night before I  left the army I asked Dukhonin, the Chief  of Staff of the front, what steps he thought should be  taken to restore the army to something of its old moral.   He said that  Kerenski should  be pressed to restore their power  and prestige to officers by doing  away with the committees,  and  that  courts-martial, in the area of armies  engaged in  offensive operations should be given power to inflict the  death penalty.     Gutor, the Commander-in-Chief of the Sou th- West Front, said that  the militarycourts whether at the front or in the rear should in time of war have power  to inflict the death penalty.   He  suggested that Tseretelli and Cheidze should be told of the actual state of things and  be asked to  help.  Kerenski  had no longer  the power, and theinitiative  must come  from  the Council of Working  Men and  Soldier  Deputies.   Hefeared that the socialization  of the terms of peace would;no longer make any difference ; the people who did  not  want to  fight grasped eagerly  at  any  excuse  such as  the formula,  &quot; Without annexations and without  contributions,&quot; of the meaning of which they had not the faintest idea.
