B. 153/26.Wit269AIR BOARD.Report to the Cabinet23th July,)1917.neral     1.       The  report for the week  ending 16th June mentionedlicy.   that  it had been  decided to order  1,000 De Havilland 4        aeroplanes, 700 of which would be  slightly modified so as  to        serve  as  long  distance bombers and would provide material        for an interim bombing programme pending the production  of a        specially designed long distance bomber.   Further consideration        of the question has led the Board  to  the conclusion that the        present design of De Havilland 4 will not be sufficiently        satisfactory as a long distance bomber to justify its manu-        facture for that  purpose to the extent proposed.   Accordingly  .        modifications  have been adopted which will in fact .convert        into  a new type of aeroplane known as the D.H.9.   This  will        prove  a very much more satisfactory machine and the delay        in production  involved (estimated  at about a month) is        thought to be  well worth incurring, particularly as the        winter months  are not very favourable for bombing operations.          2.       Negotiations are proceeding with the Italian        Government for the supply of a certain number of Fiat        260 h.p.  engines  which are urgently needed to relieve the        situation caused  by some delay, due to technical reasons,        in the development and production  of  the B.H.P. engine.        The Italian Government state that  50 will be delivered        immediately, 50 in August, 50 in September and 50 in        October,  and a further 200 by the  end of the year.   Our        requirements amount to about 250 engines with a corresponding        supply of spare parts.   The Italian Government make it  a        condition that we shall supply an  equivalent amount of raw        material  and a certain number of Vickers machine guns.   It        i3 hoped  to be able to meet them on both these points.          3.       The  question of the supply of machine guns for        aircraft  which was referred to in  the first section of the        report dated the  23rd June continues  to give rise to        considerable anxiety.   The matter is one primarily for  the        Master General of the Ordnance and the Ministry of Munitions,        but in view of the fact that aircraft without machine guns        are,  for  fighting purposes, useless,  the Air Board has        represented in both the above quarters the necessity of  the        most  energetic steps being taken to improve the output in        this  respect.   Apart from measures to increase the output        of Vickers gun3,  which can be fired through the propeller  by        means of  what  is  known as an interrupter gear, it is hoped        that  the  situation will be relieved by the adaptation of a        similar device to the Lewis gun whioh at present cannot  be        fired through  the propeller.   The development of this        invention is progressing actively.Supply.    4,followsDeliveries of engines and aircraft have been asTotalTotalTotalTotalforforforforthe week to 21st Julythe month to dateJune 1917June 1916Engines Aeroplanes Sea-planes  300*    286         23  766     845         64 1178    1081         49  335     414*Including 33 from France.(Sgd.)
