Your 38602. At time retreat commenced the only British guns with the 11th and 7th Armies were as follows :-

12 4.5" Howitzers, 12 Vickers 8" Howitzers and 6 Vickers 12" Howitzers. All the 12" were lost, but no information is obtainable here as to the other guns. Thought that about 50% of all artillery has been lost.
