SUGGESTIONS FOR SUPPORT TO BE GIVEN TO  RUSSIA         JWl^M^WTMrmT A POSSIBLE, OTBCHONT .     In accordance with information furnished by our represonta-tives in Russia,  the Entente  have  reason to believe that owingto her internal situation,  Russia  may endeavour to sign a peacebefore the end of the year.     These are the principal  reasons:-       (a) The masses,  weary  of the war,  have a tendency           to listen to talk  of a  separate peace:       (b) The Provisional  Government does not yet appear          .to possess the necessary authority to take           strong action against this pacificist movement           directed by Germany, who is conducting a strong           and heavily-financed propaganda.     It is hardly necessary to ompbaeise the gravity of theconsequences which a defection of  Russia might cause,  namely,the possibility of Germany  drawing on her forces on theEastern theatre of war in order to throw them &amp;rt masse on theFrench front - a complete reversal to her advantage of thepresent distribution of forces, end the widespread moral effecton all the nations of the Entente.  The Allied Governmentsshould, therefore, make every sacrifice in order to retainRussia in the Alliance, and by affording her constant  supportin every department, to infuse into her Government the energynecessary to hold out at all  costs..                                 II&apos;       The means to be employed are (1) political (2) economic  and (3) military.       They consist ef:       (a)  Supporting the Provisional Government in the campaign  it has undertaken against extremist elements suborned by  Germany and, with this end in view, organising against the  enemy18 campaign a vigorous countor-propaganda liberally  subsidised from a financial point of view:       (b)  putting Russia in a position to master the formidable  aoonomie crisis which  menaces her by giving her the means of4  consolidating her credit and reorganising her system ef transport.       (o)  Helping by every means to restore discipline, to  raise the morale and to increase the technical efficiency ef  the Russian Army and Kavy.
     TO carry out  this programme /France.  Great Britain and theUnited States,  the only Powers in.k position to act in Russia,should oome  to  an  agreement  without delay to determine thepart to1 bo assigned to each  of them.     Questions  of  propaganda in the interior of tho country,and offinanoial and economic help are matters for theGoverniilents  concerned, and are not treated in the presentMemoranda.     Prom the point of view  of military and ecdnomio help itwould &amp;oezn that the activities of the Allies might be dis-tributed as  follows          England will attend to the iiavy.          Prance  to the Army.          United  States to  the reorganisation of transport.                             III.     Apart from the provision of war materiel,  which appearsto be limited only by the possibilities of the  transport8ystom,  it is neoessary to improve the morale,  the organi-aation and technical instruction in the Russian Savy and Army.     As  regards the Navy, it would be the duty  of GreatBritain to draw up her programme and to put it  into exe-cution as rapidly as possible.     As  to the Array, the duty of franco would be:     (a)  To increase the importance of her Mission and toaugment the numbers of the Staff to a degree sufficient toenable it to attach French offloors to all the  higher stagesof tho Russian Command.  This latter will find  in themexperienced technical advisors while at tho same time suchsuitably chOBen officers will succeed in exercising theirinfluence in the re-establishment  of discipline and raili-tary spirit in tho Army.  By their example and  discreetadvice,  they will enlighten the Russian officers both as tonecessity and the working of discipline in a democratic Armyand - on tho relations which should exist between tho Commandand troops under a regime of disciplined liberty.     (b)  To install henceforward  the Headquarters of herMilitary Mission at the offioe  of  the Minister  for Max who, /since the revolution, has for all  practical purposes thedirection of the war in his hands.
     To this end it  seems necessary that the Chief of theFrench Mission should reside henceforward at Petrograd,  wherehe will make his1 influence more  efficaciously felt in thedirection of energetic resolutions and of the pursuit ofthe war until final  victory;     Under these conditions * and in order to direct a Missionreinforced and of a  higher importance,  the Chief of theFrench Military Mission in Russia should be a personageendowed with authority, experience and considerable prestige.     With regard to  the question of transport  it isnecessary to get the United Statee to consent to:-     (a)   Furnisk rolling-stock in order to ensure a           regularity of transport which has been impairdd           by the bad upkeep of  the existing stock.     (b)   Organise  exclusively  American (both in personnel           and material) repair  shops which will serve as           models for Russian repair shops.     (c)   Send a numerous technical Staff so as to improve           the working of the Russian railway system.     (d)   Send a Mission to Vladivostoek.for the purpose           of ensuring the transit under satisfactory           conditions of the railway materiel furnished  by           the United States.     The attention of our American Allies should be calledto the urgency of the help required to  be given to Russia,from the point cf view of transport, if an economic crisis,the consequences of  which would  &quot;be fatal,  is to be avoidedbefore the Winter.     In this task of reorganisation Japan could perhaps  co-operate by furnishing materiel or technical labour.
