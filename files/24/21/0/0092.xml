fIntelligence Bureau500SECRETBepartraentr of Information          Weekly Report on Bulgaria.  XIII                  August 1. 1917     Internal Politics     The Sahraniye was adjourned on April 5 and the intention was that it should not meet again till next October.   However, the (press&apos;hints that there is considerable agitation in favour of its reassembling almost at once for an extraordinary session;  hut it appears that the Cabinet has reaohed no decision on this point.     The usua  controversies continue between the two wings of the Socialist party on the subject of war aims.    The postponement of the StocIi!aoln Conference evidently caused some disappointment-  In the meantime &quot;Broad&quot; and &quot;Harrow&quot; Socialists persist in their at- tacks on one another.   These appear almost  daily in the columns of &quot;their respective papers.    The organ of the narrow Socialists has collected and republished the opinions of the *3road Socialist delegates in Stockholm on the necessity for  territorial contact^with Austria^Hungary secured by Bulgariars annexation of the TimokValley.    It points out that aocording to  the confession of thesedelegates they are mere mouthpieces of the Bulgarian government.Frankly the Harrow Socialists are against all annexations whichwill hamper the  realisation of their dream,  the formation of afederal Balkan Republic.    They declare  that such an ideal can onlyhe realised by compromise  on all sides and hint that -the other Bul-garian parties are just as bad as the Serbian,  Rumanian and GreekChauvinists against whom Bulgaria is fighting.    Connections with Central Europe.    The Germane-Bulgarian Society of Berlin has made  good progress
                              - Z -   a the success of its lectures and activities is often referred to.  , similar sooiety has recently been started in Sofia.     A further step in the economic connection of Bulgaria with  Gen-  ral Europe is now being taken by the arrangements made by a  com-  -&apos;Bsion sent by the Hungarian Danube Navigation Company to Sofia.  hey have negotiated with a view to bringing the charges and  the arrangements of the Bulgarian railways into closer connection with those of the steam-boats on the Danube.     Occupied Territories.     Greece&quot;s official intervention in the war was at once followed by the dismissal of the Greek authorities who had hitherto been allowed to carry on the local administration in the part of Greek Macedonia occupied by Bulgarian troops.   Bulgarian authorities have now been put in charge and, as in ths case of occupied Serbia, gul- $arian law has replaced Greek law.     Bulgarising activities continue in the Morava valley.    The Bul- garian prefeots in charge of the different departments of this dis- triot  met in conference at  llish on July 2-6.    The conference was also attended by members of the  Torava Cultural and Educational  Association and obviously its object was to  discuss further methods of  turning the country into a Bulgarian country.     Still greater are the  activities of the  Bulgarian authorities in obrogea,    A new paper,  the Vestnik Dobrudzha , has  recently been be-gun in Baba Dagh.    The number of new Bulgarian schools and churcheswhich  are being opened every/here  is witnessed to  by  the  daily state-ments  of the Bulgarian press.    A new book emphasising Bulgaria1s clftimto Dobrogea has just appeared from the pen of  a certain liavrodiyevwhose  name shows,  curiously enough,  that  he is either a BulgarisedRumanian or a Bulgarised Greek.   During  the first week of  July three
  bisters, Messrs. Dinchev, Bakaiov and PesheV, made an  extensive  Inr of the province with a view to studying its cultural needs.    Economic Conditions    What is published as to the economic situation is somewha/b dis-  fonected.   It is clear, however* that there is considerable  dis-  (esS.    The c-uestion of the lack of salt is often alluded to.    The  (iblic  Provisioning Committee informed the Administrator of the  rlcultural Bank that he must take charge of the import from  Ger-  iy of the salt indispensable to the needs of the country.  Apparent-   250  waggons  have now arrived and a hundred of these were at once   led  over to  different oo-operative societies.   There is a  con-  Iderable lack  of food supplies.    The German troops in Bulgaria  ave  now been informed that they &quot;are not to exceed the food rations  ranted to their Bulgarian comrades, and that no trafficking in food lupplies on their part will be permitted.    Requisitioning of neat lupplies for the army appears to  be going on on a considerable scale In Ila&amp;edonia,    On the other hand,  the government persists daily in ts declarations that the harvest will be  most satisfactory,  that the fains have everywhere feeen good,  and that  &quot;all danger of famine has issed.&quot;   Every family will be allowed to  keep enough food to main- fain  itself for  a year and to safeguard its live stock.    Beyond that fLl supplies must be  handed over  to  the government.    That  this is Pot being  done is shown by the  long  lists of prosecutions and  sentences [nflicted  on persons  for not declaring and  handing over food supplies p their possession.    Only the sale of clothes  actually  necessary to phe population is  allowed,  and  the number of  garments that nay be purchased by each person during the year is now  fixed.    The wholeQuestion is  to be under  the  supervision of various local  commissions.
  foreign Affairs  Bulgarian papers continue to insist that Russia is in a deplorable ite.-   The news of the Russian offensive was countered by the as- ranee that Hindenburg would now execute his great plan of invading jsia, from which he had hitherto refrained.   Considerable Glarm(st have been expressed at the change of the situation in Greece,lr the preso devotes much attention to this subject.    However, allle papers are unanimous in stating that on the whole  Greece*s de-ar&amp;tion of war  is an advantage for Bulgaria as it now unties herMs  and enables her to make  good her claims on Greek territory.ere  are few references to  the Unitod States of America exceptjasional  cheap  sneers  at her.    On the other hand the press  commentsfch satisfaction on the fact  that  the 80,000 or  so Bulgarians in  United  States have been  left  at  liberty.
