/Gen.Ho ,/2456.           Formation of Soldiers? &amp; Sailors&apos; Committees.         MEMORANDUM by the Secretary of State for War.          The subjoined minute by the Adjutant General raises-a question of importance upon which I should like theinstructions of the War Cabinet.          For some time past I have noticed in the Daily SecretReports on Labour Unrest, references to two important, matters     (a)  The formation of &quot;Soldiers1 and Sailors1 Committees&apos;1.     (b)  A discussion as to whether Army Reserve munition       workers, or soldiers lent to Munition Works are liable       to be recalled to the colours if they join a strike       and cease work.          As regards (a), there is no question but that invarious parts of the country efforts are being made toencourage serving soldiers to form Committees, and this hasactually been done in certain instances.   The first casebrought to my notice at Tunbridge Wells I dealt with directlythrough the Brigadier, and the matter is now, I think, at anend.   Another case, I am informed, happened at Birmingham,          In view of the fact that the Army of today is by nomeans as highly disciplined as that in existence before the war,and also that the classes of men serving at the present momentinclude individuals of every shade of education and opinion, itis probable that the movement to encourage soldiers to take partin political questions will be fanned by certain politicalfactions for their own ends.          The Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces,has brought the matter to Hy notice, and is of opinion that aclear line of policy should be indicated.          Under paragraph 451 of the Kingrs Regulations &quot;Anofficer or soldier is forbidden to institute or take part in,any meetings, demonstrations, or processions, for party orpolitical purposes, in barracks, quarters,  camps, or theirvicinity.   Under no circumstances whatever will he attendsuch meetings, wherever held, in uniform&quot;.          In view of the strictures which are constantlylevelled at the Military Autnorities, I think,a clear rulingshould be given by the Cabinet that if the  Kingfs Regulationsare enforced the Army Council will be supported throughout bythe
the Cabinet.   If for political reasons such a course is notadvisable, clear instructions should be given, under Cabinet.authority, as to the proposed form of action in such cases.          As regards (b), oases have come to my notice in whiohrArmy Reserve munition workers have asked at mass meetingswhether, in the event of soldier workers joining the strikers,the Trades Union Societies concerned would stand by the soldierworkers.   In one particular case the meeting unanimouslydecided that this would be so.          It was also stated at a mass meeting that if themen were recalled to the Array and sent to the front, the TradesUnion concerned would call out their men on strike until thesoldiers concerned were sent back.          One General Officer commanding an Area has suggestedthat it should be made public that any Army Reserve munitionworker or released soldier joining a strike should be recalledto the colours, and if he did not comply be treated as anabsentee.          The matter is important in view of the Labour unrestthroughout the country, and I suggest that a Cabinet decisionbe obtained to guide the Army Council as to definite actionwhich is considered advisable in the event of Army munitionworkers or released soldiers joining in strikes.          I may mention that at present arrangements have beenmade in Commands for the released soldier who is still borneon the books of the Army, to be recalled for his ownprotection to certain Camps in the event of a strike occurring.DERBY.26th July,  1917.
