                                    General  Heea^aarters,                                  British Army in the Field.                                       22nd  July  1317,The Chief of the  Imperial     General Staff.           I beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication dated 21st instant, forwarding for my information and guidance a copy of the Draft Conclusions reached by the &quot;tfar Cabinet at a Meeting held on the 20th instant, and requesting- me to forward any Observations I may wish to make in so far as the Conclusions affect ray Command.           I observe that with the exception ef sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) ef paragraph 2 of the &apos;7ar CabinetXU Conclusions the question of the operations of the Armies under my Command was not dealt with directly at this Meeting.           As regards these two sub-paragraphs, I note the decision recorded in (a).  The only remark which it appears desirable to offer on this- now is that from the postponement of their decision to such a late date I fear the War Cabinet oannet have realised clearly the very serious objections to countermanding ah attack at the last moment, especially under existing conditions in France,           The preparations for this offensive have involved immense labour for Commanders, 3taffs,  and troops for many months - Indeed some Of these preparations, suoh as railway construction and water supply arrangements, were commenced more than a year ago.           The final concentration of troops,  guns,  and everything else re quire A for 3Uch an attack entails a very heavy strain on all ranks and services for many weeks and involves the acceptance of risks on other parts of the front from the time when this concentration commences until  the attack is  launched.   These risla are seriously increased if plans are liable  to  interference,  after the concentration has oommenced,  by eanses outside the carefully calculated chances of hoatile  action.           The effect on the moral ef officers  and men might havebeen so serious if it hefi been decided,  for  no  reason a vparent to them,  to abandon the attack at this  stage, after ell their efforts to prepare for it,  after a fieroe  struggle for artilleryand air supremaoy has already  been in progress  for seme days, andwhen the assault is almost on  the verge  of being launched,  that I earnestly hope the War Cabinet may never again find  it  necessaryto postpone such a decision to the last  momenta
        from  sub-paragraph  (b)  I  note  that  I may expect the cessation of the  offensive  to  be ordered hereafter if, in the judgment  of  the Jar  Cabinet, the results are not commensurate with  the  effort made and the losses  incurred.        140 doubt,  before  such an  order is  issued,  the  effort and losses  of the enemy as well as on our side will be duly considered, as also the  possible effect on both the one?:?:  and our own -rmy of stopping  the action,  as  foreshadowed in this Conclusion.  On such  points  the judgment of the  Commander  on the  spot, in close touch with the situation, is at  least  entitled to great weight, and I trust  that  my opinion may  be taken and  fully considered before  a  decision of such vital  importance is  arrived at.        From  these sub-paragraphs, us  well  as  from the kinutes generally, I have formed the impression that  the  plan of operations,  although approved,  has neither the  full confidence nor the whole-hearted support  of the  &apos;er Cabinet.   Such an impression adds very greatly to  the responsibilities  anc-  anxieties of a  Commander in entering  on  such a  serious  undertaking-;  and if the  impression is not justified I  respectfully ask for an assurance to  that effect.        The remaining ilinutes of  the Meeting under reference deal with questions outside my command except in so  far as they indirectly affect it, or seem  likely to affect  it.        I have already urged repeatedly, both  in writing and verbally,  the importance of concentrating  our resources to the utmost possible extent on the  operations which  are  to be  carried out this summer in France.   I remain  convinced that  this  is  by far the wisest course and that,  if followed,  it would  almost certainly load to &quot;results which will make final  victory more assured and which may even brina-  it v/ithin reach  this  yoar&quot;,        I have further urged the danger of  failing  to  concen- trate out resources in the Western theatre, or  of  diverting them from it.        1 observe that it has been decided  to employ elsewhere  re- souroes which could have been made available for  the  Western theatrej and that  the future diversion of  other resources from this theatre  is in contemplation.       Hy opinions on the results of the course decided  on, and on the  further protests in contenrplotion,h- vo already been so fully expressed that it  is useless for me to repeat them.    II can  only say that in what I confid nfcly believe to be the best  interests of the Umpire I deeply regret that our resources  re not  to be concentrated, this summer,  in this Theatre, to the utmost possible extent;  and I trust chat the further diversion, and dispersion, of our forces which  is contempl ted  may not be carried out,       I desire  to allude particularly to the shortage  of  6&quot;howitzer ammunition in Prance,  of which ammunition I notice that &quot;ample supplies&quot;  are  being sent to Italy;  and also to  the probable- shortage of artillery personnel and of guns in the ^rmios under my 0 ommand.       As  regards  the further  request contained in your cormnunict -tion under reference,  requesting information as to the first objective  of my operations:-
    The first objective is ths ridge extending from  &quot;Stirling&apos;Castle&quot; (between HOOG-S and VEJ-DHCBK. east  of YPHES), byPASSCHDMDA3LE, STAJDsKBURG, and CI3PCIGI to near BIXMUDE.    I anticipate that severe fighting will be involved  in  thecapture of this ridge, which will entail a series of advanceseach of limited depth.    The time required for the capture of the ridge depends mainlyon the degree of resistance offered, but the probability is that itwill be several weeks before the enemy is driven from the whole ofit.     I have little doubt that by the time he has been driven outfrom it the strength of his resistance will have been considerablyreduced and further operations beyond the ridge will present asimpler problem and promise more rapid, results.
