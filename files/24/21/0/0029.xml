a R E T,,.  1529*                   ALLIED, C0O!EREKCE AT PABIS.                     25thr-- 2Gth- July. 1917;GENERAL PLAN OF ACTION,.                Meeting of 24th July * morning.     Present:-   His Excellency General CadomaV                General Sir W. Robertson. .                General Foch.  ,     The members of the Meeting,  after having viewed the state.of the allied and enemy armies^  and having examined the. presentsituation on all fronts,  agreed upon the following conclusions:     The actions at present developing on all fronts are therealisation of  plans drawn up\aat previous meetingd.  There isno reason to make any modifications; in any case it would be,for the moment  impossible.     In the present oondition  of Austria,, the final defeat ofthis Power is an object to be  kept in view:-     (a)  by continuing the attack on the German forces          according to the programme agreed upon between          France and Great Britain,  which,ensures,  apart&apos;          from the important objectives which are directly          aimed .at,  the tying-down of the German armies to          the Franco-British Front;          !     (b)  by attacking Austria simultaneously on two fronts,          the Italian and the  Russian, with every avail-          able means.     With this object, Great Britain and France have sent toItaly all the heavy artillery  and munitions they have to spare.At the same time it is recognised on the one side that Italywill not possess even then all the means necessary to ensurethe decisive defeat of Austria,  and on the other aide that itis impossible for Great Britain and France to do more for themoment.     GENERAL CADORNA estimates that an action against Austria,in order to be^decisive, should stretch from TOLMINO to the  -sea (80 kilometres) and would  require 10 infantry divisionsand 400 heavy guns in addition to his present forces; hecannot, however, on the eve of a great offensive,  say in whatmeasure he will be in a position to undertake a second offen-si ve, or determine vfoat forces will be necessary to make it.      Under these circumstances,  and in view of the primaryimportance of this objective of finally defeating Austria^ itwas decided to examine, when the operations now in progressare finished, the situation which will result therefrom,  as
well as the desirability and possibility 6f placing at thedisposal of Italy the  forces necessary to enable her to attainthis objective.     The forces  of the Entente  being dispersed throughout theworld,  their principal line of  communications lies by sea.      In the preparations of all schemes of operations,  themaritime situation and the question of tonnage should primarilybe kept in viev.      In this connection,  the following questions are con-3idered as being of the highest importance:*      (a)   The necessity of assuring the rapid transportation           of American troops to the Franco-British front;      (b)   The necessity of supplying Italy with the materials           (coal and steel)  necessary to enable her to manu-           facture munitions and utilise fully her reserve           of men.      ANNEX TO PROCEEDINGS 0?MILITARY CONFERENCE OF JTJLY 24th, 1917.     GENERAL CADORNA,  on being asked what reinforcements hewould require to take  TRIESTE and inflict a decisive defeat onthe Austrians,  said he would not be in a position to say untilhe knew the situation  at the end of the great battle he wasnow preparing.   He  estimated his present requirements at 10additional  infantry divisions and 400 heavy guns.  The ItalianMinister of Munitions  had promised him by May 1st., the FieldArtillery required  to  place  20 more Italian Divisions in theField,  but  he would still be very short of heavy artilleryand particularly of heavy artillery ammunition.   Asked if hecould fight a great battle during the winter,  he said thatafter his experience of last year,  he did not intend toengage in any extensive operations after October, and heexpected to resume  activity  in April or May,  according to theamount of snow which had fallen during the winter.   Lastyear had been exceptional in this respect,  and he had not beenable to begin until the middle of May.
