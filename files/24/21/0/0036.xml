D.HS.472.July 20 -36, 1917,She Finance Section ef the HMinistry ef Blockadehave Issued a paper whioh states the value ef the eommodi-tiee shipped, during the first six months ef 1917, fromtrals, and financed by credits opened with banks in theUnited Kingdom,  The total is approximately six millionssterling, as against fourteen and a half millions sterlingfor the same period of 1916*  The figures would be moresignificant If we were informed as to the value ef thecommodities financed with American banks for the samedestinations in the game period.  But they suggest thatour financial blockade is undermining the position ofLondon as the centre of international banking business,The fall in the amount of business done in London isonly in part explained by the decrease in the world1esupply of tonnage, and the panic due to the submarineblockade,       Durlnt  the period July 18 - 24, there was &amp; pronoun-cod fall of the mark on neutral bourses.  At Stockholm theexchange on Berlin fell two points, from 4&amp;*2t- to 43.85(Par of exchange being: 88,88), and in Bwitserland it fellthree paints, from 66.50 to 63.25 (Par of exchange being123.44) in three days.

           The   Danish Government hope  that wo  shall  release  the  19           vessels which are carrying 65,000 tons of  fodderstuffs to           Denmark.   If we refuse to do this,  it is  officially esti-           mateti that Denmark will export to Germany, during  tho           summer and autumn, 200.000 cows, 850,000 heifers and bull if.           and 40,000 horses;  during the winter 100,000 cattle and           20,000 horses.                The Danish Government pre a 8 for a removal  of  our           embargo on fodderstuffs, on the grounds that  (a)  tho           Danish farmers have observed tho terras of  the Agricultural           Agreement and  (b)  tho exports of cattle  to Germany have           been  reduced to an average of 0,000  head a week.   The  truthj           of the second plea may be disputed.  Our intelligence reports           show  a weekly eacport of oattle exceeding 5,000 head, and           we have reason to believe that our reports are incomplete.           Our latest report is for the week June 27 - July 4.                Denmark is tempted by Germany with the offer  of 200,000           tone  of coal a month, which is nearly double the quantity           of Oerman coal that she has received in the five months           February -  June,  It may safely be  assumed that Germany           asks  for compensation in the form of agricultural  produce *                Wo are considering whether we can ancoixrage Danish           shipments of bacon and butter to this country by bearing a           part  of the freight  charges.  The War Trade Department have           have  been asked to deal generously with Danish applications           for licenses to export goods other than food and fodder from           this  country.3.   SWSSBjB.       It is estimated that, owing to the shortage  of fodder-           stuffs, about 25$ of the Swedish stock of oattle will be           slaughtered in the coming winter. Even if a proportion of
                              .* ^ *            the meat is frosen or salted for home consumption, the            export ef 15,000 te 80,000 tone ef meat ie expected.            Naturally the whole of this amount will go te Germany.            H.M. Government ere, however, of opinion that it would            he well worth while te run the risk of such exports of            meat taking place, If Sweden can he compelled to suspend            the export of Wood-italp and Iron-ore te Germany.  But the            problem is to secure the restriction of Swedish exports to            the enemy without provoking Sweden to stop the Ens si an            transit traffic and te prevent the resumption of Swedish            sailings to the United Kingdom,  fe hope that the United           States will force Sweden te accept these terms.  % ensile           it is possible that we may induce the Swedish Government te           give facilities for the passage of important gooda te           Russia by allowing them to retain a percentage ef every           consignment for Swedish consumption.   Sir B.  Howard has           been authorised to  negotiate an arrangement en this basis.34.  IsQBiAT.    .m the  policy of the  United States towards lerway is           still uncertain we  are concluding arrangements  for the           purchase ef tho whole  output of Norwegian molybdenite  during           the year 1917, and for an option on all  the ore produced           after this  date, bat daring the war.   We  have, for the           same reason,  instructed Sir M.  Findlay to  negotiate an           agreement respecting imports ef metals into Merway.  We           still hope, however,  that  American action  may relieve  us           from the necessity of  continuing the  Fish Agreement, whioh           Is financially very burdensome. 5*  gS^gHLAJTO.    It is believed  that the Batch  Government  are en           the point ef yielding  to  German pressure in the matter ef
           the interned toman submarines.  M. Louden answers our pro-           test with assurances that ho  would bo glad if tho case of           the British interned submarines could ho submitted to the           same tribunal and similarly decided.                 The Dutch are firmly convinced  that our recent           capture of German vessels proceeding  from Belgium to the           Baltic was effeoted by means  of deliberate enoroaohmont           on Dutch territorial waters*   She Ministry of Marino have           made an official  announcement to this effect.                 ffe proposo  to insist upon a total  cessation of the           exports of Dutch  aaargarine %o Germany.  2Me  should bo           possible seelag that the  materials employed in making this           margarine are  either imported from overseas or are  made           available for  tho Gorman  trade owing  to the importation           of substitutes for homo consumption.                 The Dutch Government states that, unless an ade-           auate  supply  of fodder stuffs  cm  be imported  promptly.           it will be  necessary to slaughter 3G,i of  the  Dutch  stocks           of cattle,  9.6% of the  sheep and BQp of the  pigs and           poultry.6.   IffAIff,         he minimum monthly requirements of coal for  Italian           home consumption  are  600,000  tons,  fteu month Italy           will receive from Uroat Britain 390,000 tons and from the           United States  about  70,000 tons.  Her reserves are ex-           hausted;   her  output  of Minitione and her arrangements for           military  transport  are appreciably restricted by the need           for economy in  coal?  and she  ought to receive upwards of           a  million tons  in August  if she Is not to continue living.

Mr.  Wilson has considerably modified Mr.  Hoover^ I        memorandum to the European  neutrals,   for the present  no        specific  demands will be  addressed  to these powers. On the        other hand no licences for  esport from the United  States  to        neutral Europe  are  being  issued.              The prospects of Mr.  Hoover1s  Bill for  regulating the        wheat  market  are now extremely doubtful.  The Senate pro-        poses to  substitute a Board of three  for Mr.  Hoover.   He        would refuse  to serve  on  such a board.  The United States        Government  do not propose to regulate  cotton  prices on the        New York  Exchange,  and there is reason to think that they        would welcome an advance  of prices.  The United States        Treasury  state that they  have not yet  allocated any part of        the war loan  to meet the  specific needs of Great Britain.        At  present  they hold that they are only committed to a        general promise of  providing temporary relief to the Allied        Governments;  they will not pledge themselves to any advances        beyond those  already promised for July.  Disputes between        the heads of  the Shipping Board and the Emergency Fleet        Corporation have retarded the ship-building programme of        the United  States;  but peace has now been restored by the        firm  action of the  President.SUBMARIiffi CAMPAIGN.   The following is a summary of the losses of        merchant  shipping,  due to enemy action, which were  officially!        reported  in the period July 20 - July 26.
