EC 3   JS   1686.                WAH  CABINET.              Circulated by Secretary of  State  for  India,         (With reference to Note of 20th  July 1917  alraady cirxrola4;ot                      COMMISSIONS FOR HTPIAHS. War Cabinet.         I would venture with groat respect  to  urge  the Cabinet to come to a decision about Commissions for Indians.         This is not a scheme of my own, but la a long protracted controversy, often nearing solution, which was brought to the notico of the Cabinet by my predecessor and is strongly pressed by the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief in India.         I maintain that it is absolutely impossible to tell on Indian that he may control the destiniofe of Engiiehmen if ho beoomes a judge or en Indian Civilicii, that to the talking peoplo and to the politicians all avenues are opon, but that if ho fights for the  Empire he can never expect to  hold a position of authority.         I  ask the Cabinet to  sanction an announcement that the Cabinet lies decided to  accept in principle  the  appointment of Indians1 to Commissioned  Rank in His  Majesty^ i.rmy;&apos;  that the general conditions  upon which such  Commissions  will be earned are being discussed  between the  Government^of India, the India Office and  the &apos;7ar  Office;  but that  for  war service 9  Commissions will et once  be  granted,  7 Captaincies and 2  Lieutenancies.         The 9 Commissions which the Indian Government  ask for at once ere to be given to the  following men, who  were  all educated in the Imperial Cadet Corps  and who have seen service in the field.                                                        As

Served with fSih Garhwal 3ufles in France.  Awarded      Military -Cross; ,.Kanv/ar Savai Sinhil, nephew of Ran jit Singh!, Jam of Wawanagar,      Served in France.        In case the objection is ur^ed that these men, ifgranted Commissions, may be placed in a position in 7/hichthey might have to issue commands to Australian troops (oreven to British troops for the present) I may say I do notthink this is a contingency that need be apprehended,  fte areall anxious to make the scheme a success, and I should proposeto give the Government of Itfdia a hint to prevent any risk ofthe kind that might jeopardise the prospects of the newdeparture.  So far as we know the .nen proposed for Commissionsare no^ either employed v?ith Indian regiments or aro on thestaff in personal appointments.   If Commissioned,  the^r willpresumably continue to hold their present appointments&apos; unlessthe Government of India wish to  put them through a course oftraining with an Indian unit.
424            Ac regards  the procedure  that would be followedif the Commissions  are  granted, I would propose that thewar Office should gazette the men to  the Unattached List ofthe British Army and  to post them to  the Indian Army eitherin the same gazette or  the following  one.  The Governmentof India will  then  have full power to deal with the officersas they  think  fit.              (Initialled)    2.S.M.1/8/1917.
