\WAR  CABINET.PROCEDURE REGARDING PRISONERS OF WAR.     Memorandum by Lord Newton.      In accordance with the instructions that referenceis to be made to the War Cabinet in the ovent ofdifferences arising between myself and other Departmentswith regard to Prisoner Questions, I beg to submit thefollowing:-      Without any consultation with this Department, anarrangement has been made between the War Office,Admiralty and Home Office, under which the greatmajority of German and Austrian civilian prisoners nowat Alexandra Palace are to be removed to Knockaloe,Isle of Man.  I desire to point out that there aregrave objections to this scheme.  Civilian prisonersare always anxious to be interned if possible atAlexandra Palace, because It enables them to keep intouch with their families and because much has beendone to Improve its condition.  Khoekaloe, on the otherhand, la much disliked for various reasons,,  Thetransfer therefore will not unnaturally cause a greatdeal of resentment and discontent.  The Swiss Legationrepresenting German interests here, will doubtlessat once inform the German Government and the SwedishGovernment will inform the Austrian Government, withthe inevitable refeult that British prisoners in boththose countries will suffer.  The German Governmentwill probably make it an excuse to break up theRuhleben camp, and send the prisoners to moreunsuitable placet;  and the Austrian Government mayintern British civilians hitherto left unmolested.The effect of this,would be to greatly strengthen theagitation here for the exchange of all Germancivilians for all British civilians, and His Majesty1sGovernment might be forced by the House of Commons to givway upon this point.      It would be extremely unfortunate if thefavourable agreements recently concluded at TheHague were prejudicially effected by the actioncontemplated, but such will in all probability be thecase.      I understand that the Admiralty have no preferencefor Alexandra Palace, and would be quite satisfied withany other suitable camp which the War Office areprepared to offer; and as the latter Departmentrepresent that they are short of men it is difficult tosee how they can be short of Camps as well.      I venture further to submit that, being responsiblein Parliament for questions relating to prisoners,decisions affecting them should not be taken withoutgiving me the opportunity to express my opinion.(Signed)        Newton.Prisoners of War Department,       Downing Street,  S.O.2nd August,1917.
