-8-5  Any further communication should beaddressed not to any individual by name.but to-       THE DIRECTOR,BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.  FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,      72, VICTORIA STREET,             LONDON, S.W. 1.and should quote the Reference Number andDate of this letter.    Registered Telegraphic  &quot;GROWMORE, SOWEJ    Telephone: Vi(Sir,BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES,   FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,              72, VICTORIA STREET,                      LONDON,  S.W.  1.                  25th July, 1917,        I be-  to submit  the following Report of the Pood ProductionDepartment for the vreek  ended 24th July:-        In previous reports it has been estimated that the  totalincreased acreage  (over  the 1916 area)  for the harvest of 1917 -.:ould beabout 300,000 acres.   This v/as a very  conjectural figure,  based uponour District Commissioners&apos; reports before the spring cultivationswere completed, and.,  in  vievr of the climatic conditions  experienced,it vrould not have been surprising if the  estimate had proved optimistic.        The preliminary  figures of the  Annual Agricultural  Returnshave, however, nou been  received and she.; that the increased area ofcorn and potatoes for the  present harvest amounts to no  less than347,000 acres, made up as  follows                       AcresWheatBarleyOatsPotatoes1,911,0001,459,0002,230,000  504,000   Increase  or Decrease over    n  _1916_          -   1,000          +127,000          4145,000          * 76,000Total     4347,000        This result  exceeds all expectations and affords  some  measureof the exceptional effort made by farmers  this spring, in the  face ofunusually adverse conditions.   It also  indicates the immense  valueof the assistance given by the War Office,  by the loan of soldiers forttork on the land.    Without this help, and without the Impetus givenDy the r;ork of the Agricultural   Executive Committees, it vould havebeen impossible, not merely to effect an increase in this  year&apos;s crops,out to avert a decrease (from 1916) of not lessj-than 200,000 acres.        The net result  of the Pood Production campaign up  to date maytherefore be reckoned as an additional 550T600,000 acres  of corn and
potatoes  for  the  harvest  of  1917.    This is irrespective of the stillgreater relative  increase achieved by the small grower.   It is notpossible  to give  accurate figures  with regard to this, but the estimatealready made  of a quadrupled area  of small cultivation is probablyconsiderably  below the mark.   It  is estimated, for example, that thenumber  of allotments  in England and Wales-has been increased by atleast half a  million, and the displacement of flowers by vegetableshas been  general  in gardens  throughout the country.                          LOCAL ORGANISATION.               Work  of the  Agricultural Executive Committees .       The following are instances of specific action taken duringthe week:-Birmingham -  The  Committee have been authorised to take possession cfa neglected farm  of 31 acres at Quinton.Hampshire - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of40 acres  of land  at Bishop&apos;s Waltham.Leicester - Possession has been taken of 28 acres at Bagworth Park,and of  26 acres at Loughborough which had been neglected by the owner-occupier .Somerset  - The Executive  Committee are arranging with the Devon andSomerset  Hunt to  prevent  damage&apos;to crops by wild red deer from theQuantock  Hills.    They have  been authorised to take possession of adownland  farm at  Weston-in-Gordano.   Briars, bracken and other wildgrowths will  have to  be cleared in order that the land may be cultivatedfor corn,  and this work the  Committee propose to carry out.Suffolk,  West - Sanction  has been  given for the cultivation by theCommittee of  12 acres of  open land known as Washmere Green, nearLavenham,  at  present  used only for gipsy encampments.Surrey  -  The  Committee have  taken  possession of 62 acres of unculti-vated land at Monks Hatch, Compton, forming part of a residentialestate, and have  let  it to a neighbouring farmer.   The houseand its amenities remain  in  the possession of the owner.                              -1(a)-
Glamorganshire - The Committee have been authorised to takepossession of a neglected farm of 174 acres near Llandaff, and tolet it to a new tenant.                       Drainage of Lands,          The Anglesey Executive Committee are preparing a schemefor the cleansing of drains in the upper portion of MalltraethMarsh by which considerable extension of cultivation may beexpected.   Progress is being made with the other schemes whichhave been already reported, especially in Cheshire, Norfolk andYorkshire.                  Shot Gun Ammunition.          After a conference between the Ministry of Munitions,the Army Council and the Boards of Agriculture for England andScotland and the Ministry of Food, it was decided that, in orderthat the supply of food afforded by the shooting of game mightnot be lost, the restrictions on the issue of cartridges andshot should be withdrawn.   The Agricultural Executive Committeeshave accordingly been informed that they are relieved from theduty of dealing with applications for licences.   In many countiesthis duty was a considerable burden upon the Committee and theirstaff.                    Home Brewing of Harvest Beer.          It having been decided that in counties where thepractice of home brewing of harvest beer prevails, permits maybe given for the purchase of malt at the rate of 2 bushels foreach labourer who brewed or was supplied with home brewed beer inthe harvest of 1916.   Authority has been given to the Committeesfor those counties to issue such permits, subject to the conditionsimposed by the Ministry of Food.                       Credit for Farmers.          Authority has now been received from the Treasury for anextension of the existing credit scheme so es to enable credit tobe given at the discretion of the Agricultural Executive Committees
fov the gurehass    any re^tuiiw^nts necessary for tfce increase offood production, more especially working horses, machinery andimplements, but not for the payment of wages.          The banks have declined to grant overdrafts for a longerterm than nine months, but they will raise no objection at the endof that term to a renewal of the overdraft for a further term. Therate of interest will be 5% as at present.  The Treasury intimatethat the arrangement is to be regarded as an emergency one, and thatthe guarantee is only to apply to loans made up to the 31stDecember, 1917.             Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).          Reports received from 1,035 Boroughs or Urban Districtsshow that in these districts 193,326 applications for plots havebeen made, and 175,062 plots, containing a total area of 13,023 acr-eshave been provided under the Cultivation of Lands Order 1917  (No.2).                     HORTICULTURAL SECTION.          The total number of horticultural representatived is now631, and reports Indieiiie that they are doing valuable work inspreading horticultural knowledge, encouraging cultivation andhelping in the formation of Food Production Societies. The number ofthese Societies which have now been formed at the instance of theDepartment is 124.Fruit Bottling. Travelling instructors are now engaged in givingdemonstrations in fruit bottling in every county of England andWales with two exceptions.  The number of demonstrations given bythe instructors during the week was 223.          The number of glass jars for bottling for which orders werereceived during the week was 184,500, making a total of 1,439,304;the number of jars despatched was 110,520, making a total of &apos;&apos;326,472. With the object of increasing the rate of delivery theMinistry of Munitions has placed contracts with two additionalfactories.Potato Spraying. All the firms concerned have completed theircontracts for the supply of Knapsack Spraying Machines, and all themachines ordered have been despatched.  200 Knapsack SprayingMachines have been supplied *,o the Scottish Board of Agriculture.  Thenumber of cases of chemicals despatched during the week is  728,making a total of 33,708, .
                                                                 6$          Reports of late blight have been received from Pembroke-shire, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Wiltshire.   A strikingexample of the value of spraying is to be seen at Redruthwhere a crop of sprayed potatoes is free from blight and an unsprayedcrop alongside is badly attacked.Vegetable and Fruit Preserving.   A leaflet on Fruit and VegetableDrying has been published and is meeting with, a wide circulation.          Arrangements have now been completed for the installationof a four-unit plant at Maidstone capable of pulping from 2,000 to3)000 tons of fruit during the season .   Agreements are beingdrafted for installing two unit plants at Pershore and at Cheltenhamin conjunction with the Pershore and Cheltenham Fruit Growers1Societies.   It is expected that these plants will be ready for theearliest plum crops on August 7th.          Negotiations are also in progress for installing two ormore units at each of four centres  in Devon, two centres inWorcestershire, one centre in Shropshire and one in Kent.          The material pulped at Pershore and Maidstone will betaken by the Army and a supply of barrels will be provided by thecontrolled jam firms working for the War Office.    In addition tothe barrels so provided the Department has secured 14,000 barrels.          Several Oast Houses have  been selected for vegetable dryingstations in Kent, and plant for 10  units has been ordered.    TheOast Houses will be equipped as soon as the machines can beobtained.          Orders have been placed for  300 &quot;Home Canners&quot; and  thedelivery of the canners at the rate of 100 per week is  guaranteedto begin in the first week in August.    The first consignment  ofthe 500,000 cans ordered from Messrs.  Thomasson has been Slivered.The price  of the canner has been fixed at  6.10.0 and the cans willbe supplied in one gross and five gross lots at  a price  of  from33/6 to 45/6 per gross, according to the size of  the  can and theconsignment.   Arrangements,are being  made to train instructors  incanning so that the purchasers of the  apparatus may receive thenecessary  instructions.
                     TECHNICAL DIVISION,Inspection of Land,  (1) An area of derelict land in Herefordshirehas been visited, and. the owner advised as to its treatment.   (2)Following a personal inspection of his farms, detailed plans havebeen drawn up for a Breconshire landowner for dealing with theland already in his possession, and with a further tract of outrunland shortly coming under his control.Supplies of Hay and other Fodder Crops, Apprehension having beonexpressed lest an extensive ploughing up of grass land in the comingautumn should seriously affect the supply of fodder in. 1918, amemorandum has been prepared containing suggestions for safeguarding -the fodder supply.Harvesting of Local Seeds, Arrangements have been made for thecollection of indigenous seeds of such pasture forming plants aswild white clover, cocksfoot, crested dogs tail,  tall fescue, etcin Breconshire,   Women and school children will be employed.Plant Diseases. Among the reports received from honorary corres-pondents during the week is one drawing attention to the seriousdamage being caused by the cabbage root fly in South V/ales.    Anextensive series of trials with &quot;tarred felt discs&quot; to test theirpracticability as a means of combating this pest,  is at presentbeing conducted throughout the country, and the  preliminary resultsgive grounds for believing that the proposed method of treatmentwill bo satisfactory,                        LABOUR.                        -Men and Horses for the  1918 Programme,  The scheme by which skilledploughmen and horses are to be placed under the  control  of theAgricultural Executive  Committees  to assist farmers  in bringingadditional land under cultivation has been issued.   During  the weeksome 500 members of the Metropolitan Police who  are  skilledploughmen have been interviewed,  and many of thorn  have been  sentout under the scheme into various  counties,  each man in  charge  ofa team of Army horses.     Arrangements are being made with the VJar Office  by  which horseswill be bought for this Department by the Army Purchasing  Officers,
 and the Chairman of each County Committee is nominating a representative to assist the Army buyer.          The first instalment of 9,000 soldiers for work connected with  the 1918 Programme is expected to be sent to the Distribution Centres this week.   The War Office have also notified the Depart- ment  that another 5,000 men are to become available immediately.          An Army Council Instruction has been issued on the subject of the employment of soldiers on agricultural work, placing all the soldiers working on the land under the same conditions as regards payment etc. Prisoners of War.  Pour new schemes for the employment of prisoners of war have been sent to the War Office.   Five fresh batches of prisoners have commenced work during the week, bringing the number of agricultural camps up to 15, employing in all 1,374 prisoners.                             Women!s Branch.          There is evidence that the farmers are relying upon a further supply of soldier labour and are not making adequate use of the available supply of women,  although the reports  on thework of the women who are&quot; in employment on farms continue to bevery  satisfactory.    The Department have consequently urgedExecutive Committees to prevent soldier labour being allocated or used in such away as to displace any women already  employed on the land, and have stated that  &quot;a proved willingness to  employavailable women workers should be  held to constitute a  preferentialclaim for additional soldier labour,  if the  latter is needed.&quot;          According  to the reports tiais week,  6,027 women have  beenaccepted under the National Sorvice Scheme  for work on  the  land,and 9,289 have been  rejected.          Those accepted are accoimted for  as  followsIn Instruction Centres...............1,512On Farm Work.........................3,953Waiting for references to be  placed in Training Centres.........  310Waiting in depots for employment.....  116Waiting in their own homes...........  136
                MACHINERY AMD IMPLEMENTS.Motor Tractors. Thirty-four tractors were-cojisdgne^lj^t jw-eek  .to Executive Committees in England and Wales bringing the totalnumber so allocated up to 769.   Thirty-six further tractorsare now available for offer, or actually on offer to ExecutiveCommittees.   In addition there are 7 caterpillar tractors inuse in four counties.Harness. Five hundred and fifty plough sets of harness, with 100additional collars have been supplied to Committees for usewith the horses to be provided by the Departments   Eighty-fivefurther plough sets remain in stock.   With regard to prospectivedeliveries, definite information has been promised by the WarOffice as soon as possible.   The Contracts Department at presentestimate being able to deliver 2,000 to 3,000 sets during thenext three or four weeks, and it is expected that 200 to 300additional sets may be provided from stocks at Woolwich.   Inaddition this Department hopes, itself, to secure 30 to 40 sets aweek.          No special difficulty is anticipated in obtaining theharness required except as regards collars.   Very few makersof horse collars are now available, and the Contracts Departmentcan at present promise delivery of only 220 collars a week.Agricultural Executive Committees have been asked to makeenquiries for suitable harness in their own districts,Horse-drawn Implements.  The following purchases have been madeduring the week by the Department or by Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees:-      Ploughs......... 302    Cultivators..... 23      Whippletrees..,, 148    Carts........... 11      Disc Drills.....   5    Rollers.........22      Harrows.,.......  48          In addition, 350 ploughs haye been purchased through theMinistry of Munitions,   The Ministry have placed contracts vrtiichprovide for the delivery of 85 ploughs a week to the total of 1,130,beginning in six to eight weeks&apos; time.   This is the first instal-ment, and the Ministry of Munitions are pursuing enquiries.
                   SUPPLIES.Sulphate of Ammonia,  Representations have been made that thescarcity and high price of bags at the present time is givingrise to difficulties in the sulphate of ammonia trade.   TheDepartment are endeavouring to arrange with the Jute Controllerfor the supply of bags to makers at a fixed price,Basic Slag.  A notice as to the price of basic slag has been pre-pared for circulation to farmers.   Makers and dealers have beenasked for their observations in the first instance, and substan-tial agreement has been reached.Potash.  The Department has agreed to undertake the sale anddistribution of potash produced at the Government Potash Factory,and also of the flue dust from iThich the potash is extracted.The factory will not be producing potash for some months, but theraw flue dust is available at the present time and it is believedthat it will afford a very useful means of supplying potash to theland at a relatively Cheap price.Lime.  An application for 50 civilian prisoners of war to beemployed by two lime firms in Radnorshire has been granted.   Limeis only used to a small extent at this season of the year, and itis very difficult to forecast what the demand will be in theautumn.   The arrangements for dealing with the waste lime,  whichforms a bye-product in various industries, are being pressed for-ward.Drain Pipes,  The supply of land drain pipes in the country is verysmall and their manufacture is much restricted.   It is proposedto secure moderate quantities in order to have a stock in handlater in the year.   Offers are being obtained from firms invarious parts of the country.Wire Fencing.  The supply of fencing wire and wire netting isalso very short, and although priority certificates have  beengranted for the manufacture of a limited amount of wire,  the pres-sure of military orders has so far prevented its production.   The
Department are, therefore, proposing to arrange, if possible, forfirms not directly engaged on army work to draw wire of standardsize against the priority certificates already granted.Seed Wheat of the 1917 Crop,  Reports received from members ofthe Selection Committee indicate that the crops which are beingaccepted for distribution as seed by the Department are ofexcellent quality and that the stock of seed which will beavailable under this scheme is likely to be as good as can beobtained anywhere.Seeds (other than Cereals).  The returns of the acreage alreadycontracted for in connection with the growth of root seeds havebeen received from sixteen large firms.   The Advisory Committeeconsidered the figures, and further information concerning thoseareas,  about which negotiations are still pending,  has been askedfor.   The Committee will meet to consider the amended returnson Friday next and, if the acreage is shown to be below thenormal,  steps will be taken to secure the planting of the supple-mentary area required.     Attention was drawn to the fact that the Cambridge Agricul-tural Executive Committee had caused a notice to be displayedin various markets throughout the county calling the attentionof farmers to the importance of growing seeds for food production.It was  decided to invite Agricultural Executive Committees inother seed growing counties to adopt the same course.          The Department have been informed that the Foreign Officehas communicated with Washington regarding the preferentialtreatment of seeds sent by rail to American ports for  shipmentto, and intended for sowing in,  the United Kingdom.Seed Potatoes.  In order to secure adequate supplies of seedpotatoes for planting on farms in areas infected with  wart diseasein England and Wales, negotiations have been opened with theMinistry of Food and the Board of Agriculture for Scotland for                            -9-
the Issue of an Order prohibiting the sale of Scottish grown&quot;King George Vth&quot;  and &quot;Great Scot&quot; for consumption,  and suggestingthat the whole of  the crops of these varieties,  where the areaplanted exceeds an acre,  should be reserved for  seed purposes.                       I  am,                            Sir,                                Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt.  Hon.  Rowland E,  Prothero, M.P.       President  of the  Board  of Agriculture                  and Fisheries.
