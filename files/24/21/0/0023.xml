  COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY  THE VfAB CABINET JO JNpjTISATE  OTJfMvlf^BAfTfFsT^ pt-irffop!Fiffl taksn  to  secure           ^HETPlCKlR l^Hf^HO^ Of.(For Report of  Committee, and Minority Report by Sir Norman Hill,  see  Papers G.T, 1404 and 1493  respectively.)      Copy of letter from the Shipping Controller to the        Secretary,  \7ar Cabinet.                                         Ministry of Shipping,                                           St. James*s Park,                                              London,  S.W. 1                                          26th July, 1917.Dear Hankey,           1  am much obliged to  you for your letter of the18th instant, in reply to mine of the 14th.  Sir Norman Bill18  .Minority Report is  now to hand,  and has been carefully consideredby myself and my advisers..  I am therefore sending you in thisletter my considered opinion upon the subject matter of both theMajority and  Minority Reports, and I take it that after perusingit, you will  be in  a position immediately to circulate thenecessary material  to the War Cabinet, andjojplac^Si^J^MmM^SM^  From ray own point^^r^ewTT am most anxiousthat an authoritative decision shall be given immediately, forreasons which you will readily perceive from the tenor of this  -letter.           I  do notpropose to oceupy the time of the  WarCabinet by any detailed examination of the (majority)  reportof Mr. Illingworth1s Committee;   Sir Norman Hill!s report initself is sufficient evidence that many of their conclusionson particular issues cannot be regarded as established,  and onsuch issues I prefer to leave the matter where it stands,  merelyobserving that the  criticisms passed by Sir Norman Hill  uponvarious portions of the report of his colleagues appear  to meboth just and convincing and are in accord with my own personalknowledge. In passing,  I would  also observe that the  openingpart of Sir Norman  HillTs report appears to me speciallyvaluable as bringing into relief the circumstances attending theappointment of Mr,  Illingworthrs Committee,  and the nature of theproblem presented to them.    I cannot but think that there aremany passages in the Majority Report which are not relevant totheir remit from the War Cabinet,  which was to prove or  refutethe statement made  in the Memorandum placed before the War Cabinetthat &quot;it is of no use to speed up the discharge  of the ships solong as the railways are unable  to carry the  cargo as  dischargedto its destination.   The storage capacity of  the ports islimited - quays,  transit sheds,  warehouses become blocked  anddischarge becomes impossible.  The rate  of the discharge  of thesnips must be equated to the rate of the inland  distributionof these cargoes.&quot;
            But the  main question is  obviously whether Mr-Illingwortl^s  Committee  is  nor is not  to  remain in existence, as they themselves  rsooissead,  and I  may as well say at once that  I  am very strongly of  opinion that the  answer to that question should he  -ouhesibating iy given in the negative,  an opinion which  it  will  be sean  is  expressed &quot;by Si?  Ho man  Hill in the  penultimate  olaus-a of his  report.   Thai the Ministry of Shipping ought to &quot;be the executive and administrative authority on the  questions which that Committee was charged with considering, is in  my  view no mere claim  of  my own,  but a &quot;res  judicata&quot;, the War Cabinet having  on the 13th June,  accepted Lord  Miner1 e  recommendation of  the  11th  June,  whereby my Department  was to be authorised  to develop the West Coast Ports, and whereby approval was given to  my action  in creating a new branch  of my office for tails very purpose.    In view of this decision I  do  not think I need apprehend  that the  War Cabinet would desire to keep in existence  a  Committee which would practically Civide  control with myself  unless they saw raason to suppose  that circumstances had charged si?iee they gave their decision,    I  am unaware that circumstances  have so  charged, and in  support of my contention  that MruIllingworth*s Committee, if perpetuated, could  not but come intfi competition and probably into  collision with my authority,  I  think l  need onl^? refer to their own report, in which they actually  suggest (page El)  that it might  be  possible for my subordinates  to  report  to  them. Clearly any  arrangement which contemplates such a breach  of the ordinary  maxims of  good administration  stands in a  great  measure self-condemned.            It might, no doubt, be  argued  that the authority of the Ministry of Shipping upon matters of  pert and inland  trans- port must necessarily be exercised within limits imposed  by the existence of the Port &amp;  Transit Executive Committee,  the  Canal Control Committee,  and  the Railway Executive  Committee, and  that therefore the  continued  existence  of Mr.Illingworth^s  Committee is not open  to objection on merely constitutional grounds and must be  judged solely  from the standpoint of  expediency,  the question  to be asked being whether the Committee would prove an extra  cog in the wheel.   I should not by  any means be perturbed by this line  of argument,  as my objection to the Committee^ perpetuation is strictly practical, and is based on the  firm belief  that itwould and  could give rise to nothing but overlapping and irritation, and the retardation of necessary reforms;  but even  in theory I do not think the argument is aound,   The Port &amp; Transit Committee is now an integral part of the Ministry of Shipping;.  anij?other Committees named,  have clearly marked and independent spheres of responsibility,  their relations with the Ministry of Shipping constituting only  a comparatively small part of their functions.    A Committee like that of Mr.Illingworth, which would,  on its own showing, ne neither under Departmental control,nor executive in character, nor well defined in function,, nor charged with any duties  except duties which the Ministry of Shipping ought to perform is, tomy mind, quite a different proposition;   nor  indeed do Iunderstand the process of reasoning which has led the Committee to conclude, after they have apparently admitted (page IV) that a Central Committee such as  Mr.Ly3ter originally recommended i9 not now necessary,  that they should  themselves continue ia being inate rySimilar oapacity,  and with the additional ana aomewhai xa^coiastitttti^aaX right of direct scours to taeVTai Cabinet itself.
In conclusion, I should like to say that the Port Authoritie-swho ere now brought into direct contact with the various andcompeting claims of so many Government Departments, and whohave so many special difficulties, both with labour and fromother causes, to contend with, are not unnaturally apt toprove restive under the pressure which is necessarily andlegitimately exercised upon them in the national interest bythe different branches of State activity.  It is of the firstimportance thai these influences should be co-ordinated andharmonised as far. as possible and I am convinced that theperpetuation of Mr. Illingworth1 s Committee would have a mostunfortunate effect in this respect.   In this sphere of work,I have every reason to hope. and believe that the new Branch ofmy office referred to in the enclosure which Lord Milnerappended to his report of the 11th. JunlHe a most valuableasset to my Department and to the country, but I shall not beable to entertain this hope in anything approaching the samemeasure if I am to feel that the work of this Branch is to becomplicated and delayed by having constantly to take intoaccount the views and proceedings, of a Committee over whichI have no contrdl and no right to exert influence.  I am ofcourse far from suggesting that Mr. Illingworth&apos;s Committeehas not done useful service to the country in various directionsand I have no doubt that the War Cabinet will share my desirethat they-should be given both credit and.thanks for thkirwork;  but my whole position is that with the incorporationof the Port and transit Execxitive Committee in my Department,and with the. development within that Department which I havealready described,  there- is- no longer scope for the Committee&apos;sactivity,  and I sincerely trust that the war Cabinet willaccept my view on this important matter.                               Yours sincerely,                            (Signed) &quot;&quot;&apos; j. P. MACLAY.Lieut.Col. M.P.A0HanI:ey,  K.C,B*
