SECRET.G.T. - 1558             WAR CABINET.          EXTRACT OF A REPORT ON CAPTAIN LAWRENCE&apos;S          JOURNEY,  FROM A LETTER TO SIR WILLIAM ROBERTSON          FROM SIR R. WINGATE DATED 11th JULY,  1917.         Captain Lawrence has arrived after, a journey throughenemy country which is little short of marvellous.   I attacha rough sketch illustrating his route.   He started from WEJHon 9th May with 36 Arabs and marched via JAUF to NEBK (nearKAF) about 140 miles N.E. of MAAN,  crossing and dynamitingthe HEJAZ railway en route.   There he met AUDA ABU TAYI ofthe HUEITAT Tribe, whom he left at NEBK with instructions toraise men for a raid in the MAAN - AKABA neighbourhood.Lawrence himself then rode on with only two men through verydangerous country to a place near TADMUR where he interviewedANEIZEH SheikhSr,   He then struck due West to the railway atBAALBEK, destroying a small plate girder bridge in thatneighbourhood, and thence down the railway to within 3 milesof DAMASCUS.   From DAMASCUS he proceeded S.&quot;r. and, aftervisiting the DRUSE Chiefs at SALKHAD, returned to NEBK wherehe found ABU TAYI had collected his force of tribesmen.On 19th June they moved to BAIR (about 60 miles N.E. of MAAN).At BAIR Lawrence left the Arab force and struck due Westacross the railway, then turned Nor,th and marched Westof AMMAJM to UH-KEIS, close to the southern shores of LakeTiberias, where he inspected the bridges in the YARMUK Valley.Thence he returned to BAIR having interviewed various Chiefson the way, destroyed the line in several places and deraileda train.From
mm         From BAIR the  Arab  force  (some  2,000  strong)  swept  thewhole country down to AKABA,  leaving MAM,  but annihilating  allthe smaller posts including  in one place a  whole Turkishbattalion of some [?00 men.    The Arabs are  now in occupation ofAKABA where they have  600 prisoners, including 20 officers and aGerman IT.CO., and Lawrence  estimates the Turkish losses inkilled at about 700.         I have not yet been able  to discuss his journey withLawrence as he has only just arrived and is somewhat exhausted by1,300 miles on a camel  in the last 30 days.   Moreover, S .E.F.Intelligence have first call on his information.   I think,however, that you would be interested in the above brief sketchof a very remarkable performance,  calling for a display ofcourage, resource, and  endurance which is conspicuous even inthese days when gallant deeds are  of daily  occurrence.
