WAR  CABIHET.1J0TB OH OUR PROSPECTS by OEIIERAI SMUTS.         The following remarks are not made in any  dogmaticspirit, but are intended to reinforce the point of  view Imentioned at this morning&apos;s discussion in Cabinet-,   A  finalstock-taking of cur position and prospects is i.ot possibleat present.   Much depends on how and how far the presentoffensive on the western front will go;  on tbe Liitrationand temper in enemy lands on which we aro very imperfectlyinformed;  on the tenacity of om allies;  on innumerableuncertain factors.   Put in the end everything may  dependon our own clearness and strongth of purpose,  and  it istherofore advisable that the situation as it is row developingshould be faced by us in its most unfavourable light, and ourmeasures be taken accordingly.         The disappearance for tho present of Russia ss  aserious military faotor, even if sho makes no separate peaco,is a grievous  blow to us which disappoints the hopes of anearly victory.    But it need not and should not lead to  aninconclusive peace, which will in reality mean a great disasterfor us and for tho world.   Even greater disappointments maybe in store for us.   I?ranoo is largoly kept in this war bythe prospect of the recovery of Als&amp;ce-Ioraine.   If the wartakes so unfavourable a turn that that prospect disappears;ox if Germany makes hor an offer of Alsaco-Ioraine, in wholeor in part,  we may find her yield still further be  thscompulsion of extremo exhaustion, war-woarine.-:s,  and nationalinfirmity.    The endurance of Italy under severe economicconditions and shortness of essontials may also prove anuncertain factor beyond this year.   It may,  tnoroxoro,  wellbe that the situation for us is going to be nuci Gather tnanit is at present,  and that the nadir of our fortunes has by nomoans been reached.   But oven so  &quot;&quot;think wo  shall continue tohold very strong cards and shou?.d under no circum? canoescontemplate a disastrous peace.   Our strength is too greatand the issues  at stake are too vast for us to ever to eontem-plate a peace which will in effect mean a defeat.    Even ifthe worst happens  to some of our allies in Europe,  we shallhave behind us  the trade and communications of the world andthe incomparable resources in material and man-power of Amorica.These two combined should enable us in the end to bring Germanyto terms favourable to us.    Her most powerful classes lookforward to  the  recovery of her world trade which  we  have wrestedfrom her and from which,  so long as our  sea supremacy ismaintained,  she is for over debarred.SECRET.g.  ti  1673.
From a diplomatic point of view I csncot conceive a morepowerful means to bring Germany to terms than tho throatof future continuous, relentless economic war which woare at present keeping suspended over her;  whetheror not wo ere in fact going to exercise it in future.In the ond she will surrender much in order to rooovoren entrance to the markets of tho world-  3esides thiswo hare the combined resources of the British Umpire andthe United Gtatos of America, which if fully androsolutoly used by the governments determined to win,must in tho end achieve victory, although that endmay not come before 1919 or 1920.     To secure that end we must in the first placefight and fight hard.  Our army is now an incomparableinstrument, and without sacrificing it recklessly theutmost use must bo made of it to break the spiritof the onemy.  ue shall bo able to gauge tho situationmore accurately after the enemy has felt tho full effectof the force which we have been preparing for the lastthree years.     In the second placo we must make such ^udioiouause as ie at present possible of our diplomaticweapons,  though I admit that with the fortunes of warapparently gom^ against us at present, the smaller-allies of Germany may shrink from desertion of whatmay appear to thorn the winning- party.   But thoirexhaustion io rery great;  in the case of Turkeyespecially her decline during the war has boon such, andshe has so little to  ain from its continuance, that itmay be possible in the near future to detach her, especiallyif she fails in her coming Palestine and ^iesopotaunanoffensives,  1 feel, however, that our existing treatiesof partition of the rurkich Empire hampor us vory much inany possible overtures to Turkey, and now Italy wants toadd another treaty to the embarrassing list.  I hopo woshall resist this and if necessary even canoe1 existingarrangements ao as to get a free hand for future nego-tiations with Turkey.  Detachment of Turkey will re-oponthe Dardanelles and enable us to restart Russia at a lateratego of the war, if 3ho has not made peaeo in thomeantime.     In the third place I consider far more effectivemeasures should bo taken to bring home to the Governmentand peoplo of the U.S.A. the magnitudo of the task theyhave undertaken.  Their resources are such and theirnational will io suoh that, once thoy realise what ieat etako for them  nd the world, tbey will organise ona corresponding scale and come to tho resoue with anirresistible force.   President Wilson hau shown somaof the greatost  qualities, and if he could bo rousod toa full realisation of what is at stake he may bo expootedto work wonders.  I have mentioned in Cabinet what Iconsider the most effective step to bring home to him thegravity of the situation in Europe,  end I feel it is astep whioh beyond all others will appeal to the imaginationand chivalry of America.   And the same opportunity couldbe used to say a wise worft in Canada, which may yetprevent disastrous political developmenta in that Dominion.
       Finally, X think the time is coning when the Britishpeople should he told the truth.  They do not understand atpresent.  The newspapers create, a false mirage of illusions.The people think we are on the road to &quot;break Germany,  andmany good Christian souls are filled with pity for her fate.They do not realize that the danger is all the other way,and that at the end of the third year of the war,  everythingis still in the balance, and that the balance appears  to beinclining the wrong way.  The people should be calmly  andjudiciously told the truth; they deserve th know the dangersahead; the collapse of Russia affords a suitable opportunityfor them to be taken into &quot;the confidence, of their leaders.They will stand the truth; it will strengthen instead  ofweakening then.  They are capable of much greater efforts,great as their effort has been up to now,  and they willmake these efforts if they realise what is not only at stakebut in danger.  Our resources in men are still ample if anew comprehensive conscription bill is passed and thepresent maae of exemptions and protections swept away.  Itmay even be possible to include Ireland in a new Con-script ion Act; but first of all it is essential to makethe people realize the actualities of the situation as werealise them.  I feel cure that if sensationalism is avoided,a wise frankness in the speeches to be delivered on the 4thAugust will be the means of untcld good and will establisha fresh rapport between the people and their leaders.   Therehas been a drifting apart, and the time has come to reuniteall in the realization of the truth.    nothing will moreeffectively help to win the war than this  renewal  of con-fidence between the people and the political leaders.         In saying the above I do not mean to  convey thatthe situation io bad.   What I  moan to say  is thai-,  even ifit were far worse and much graver perils were  encountered,oven then wo ought to win if our moral and materialresources arc properly organised and  utilised.
