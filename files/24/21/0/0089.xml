Tho following is a brief statement on the work carried out by the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland in 1917, and in connection with the organisation of supplies of requisites for tillage and harvest operations in 1918:-

Loans for Agricultural Implements

The number of applications for loans for agricultural implements received by the Department during the week was 125. The total value of machinery ordered to date under the Scheme is Â£78,758.

Harvesting Operations

Practical courses of instruction in the use of harvesting machinery are now being given on the Department&apos;s farms at Glasnevin, Co. Dublin and Athenry, Co. Galway. At the last named centre close on 100 Instructors have been in attendance during the week at the demonstrations and general courses of instruction.

Spraying of Potatoes

Repeats received from the Department&apos;s officers indicate that spraying operations are still being extensively carried out in various parts of the country. Second sprayings have been completed in many districts, and not a few of the reports refer to farmers being now engaged in spraying their crops for the third time.

Though reports of fresh outbreaks of potato blight have been received from several districts no serious oxtension of the disease has occurred during the week. The prospects of the potato crop are at present  particularly good.
