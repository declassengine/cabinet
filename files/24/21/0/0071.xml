I am directed by the Shipping Controller to press fora very early reply to his letter cf the- 31st May relative tothe enlistment of indispensable members of shipowners&apos; staffs.       -Sir Joseph Maclay desires it to be clearly understoodthat the indiscriminate refusal of further exemption to manyof these men on the grounds that they are in clerical occvpa-tions in an industry which is not specifically covered by thelist of certified occupations has already become a mostserious menace to the economical handling of shipping.        In further explanation  of the present position Iam to st-:te ths,t,  re3e.ru.leaa of the Controller1 a carefullyconsidered opinion in individual cases expressed in a letteraddressed to the applicant for the assistance of the Tribunal,the latter have in many instances refused exemption owingentirely to the lack of definite instructions regarding hiisclass of case,  the opinion being expressed that if the Con-troller is interested in the man&apos;s work he can arrange forhis exemption independently.  Such powers needless to saySir Joseph doe3 not poBaes        In certain cases the Controller has approached theWar Office direct with a view to exemption but on each occasionthe reply has been that the Tribunal had alreacy decided thecase.
