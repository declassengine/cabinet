                     WAR CABINET.            -$HE POSSIBILITY OF A SEPARATE PEACE                     tttTH TURKEY   Memorandum by Captain The Hon. Aubrey Herbert, H.r.     In Memorandum No.  1*  was a statement of an interview with aTurk of one of the most prominent families, whose sympathieswere Anglophile.   In this interview he stated that the Anglophileparty in the Committee  was growing in strength, that it desiredto drive Enver Pasha from p*wer, and to have an immediate ententewith England,  but that  it was not prepared to put this policy Intoforce without promises  of moral and financial help from GreatBritain.     In the second interview at Interlaken I met two Turks whohad come from a conference of important officials and men at Zurich.2hese two Turks reported that the decision of this conference wasto send an envoy to Constantinople, who was to return to Switzerlandwith an appointed person armed with credentials from T. whichwould give him authority to negotiate with some representative flfGreat Britain.     The first question to suggest itself is: Has a clever trapbeen laid for us?   The governing Turks are past masters in theart of intrigue,  and the Turkish Government would naturally bean:;ious to sow dissensions between ourselves and our Allies.  Ifthey could whisper that we were making a separate peace, advan-tageous to ourselves,  there would be a fruitful hope of quarrelsbetween the Allied Governments.  It is possible that the Turkswith whom I talked are  instruments of Bnver Pasha, but I do notthink it is likely^  The first Turk has always been a pronounced                                                     Anglophile
Anglophile, while one of the other two (ana I think both) hadhis life saved in the past by Englishmen.  Also, while they wereready enough to see me, they did not go te see their old friendsHugh Whittall and Middleten Edwards, because they knew thatthese gentlemen were engaged in military intelligence, and theTurks made it clear that they did not moan to give away mili-tary secrets.                This would, I think, bo a fair summary of theattitude of the three Turks      I.        Pheir country is going to ruin, and they desirepeace.      II.       They foresee that Turkey must be supported by somegroat Power, and they wish that Power to be England and notGermany,      III.      To bring about peace they are prepared tc havea revolution, but they see the dangers of this course, and arenot prepared to follow such a policy without guarantees of safetyand protection from Great Britain.      IV.       With the object of gaining these guarantees theyhave drawn up a scheme, and in this scheme, like all Orientals,they ask f^r what they know to be more than thoir maximum.  Asitj^jtands, this scheme, which was put into my hands twentyminutes before my train left Geneva, shows signs of haste, evenfrom a Turkish point of viow.  Prom our point of view it is notacceptable, but it 7/ill do as a basis from ?/hich wo may developa satisfactory settlement.                              i;                The paramount considerations are      .1*        Our obligations to our Allies.
 K.    2.        Our obligations to the Arabs, and particularlythe King of tho Hcdjaz.     &apos; 3.        Our material interests in Mesopotamia and Palestine.      4.        The entire situation and the enormous advantage ofgetting the Turks out of the war, and      5.        The impending Turkish campaign in the autumn.      1.A,      Our obligations to our Allies.   We have enteredinto a number of obligations with Russia, Prance and Italy,  Withregard to Russia this is the situation :-                Wo promised Constantinople to Russia, and in order tomake our promise good Y/e sacrificed many thousands of livesin the Dardanelles.  It was not our fault that we failed,  xheRussians know this, and the present Government of Russia hasdefinitely repudiated any desire to possess Constantinople.           ...  -                                           /&apos; V;&apos;      B. FRANCE, Before the war our promise to Prance was sixdivisions and the help of our Fleet.  2he French will admit thatwo have been botter than our,promise.  If the issue can be fairlyput before them, it is difficult $o. see- how they could refusetheir assent to a common policy based upon parity of sacrificebetweon themsolvea, ourselves, the Russians and the Italians.They aro asked to sacrifice what they do not possess In orderto win the victory that is not in sight to-day.    If they areprepared for another winter,  and count that the more palatablesacrifice,  so bo it.    But we warn thorn, as we /warned them inthe ^erbo - Bulgar Crisis, that to insist on every item intho Allied programme may moan tho loss of the programme.                                                           At
     At the same time, they cannot be reminded too emphaticallythat, while they are asked to give up territories that theydo not possess, and for which they have not fought, we areprepared to give up land that we do not hold, and for which wehave shed so much blood.     he adhere to our declarations, e.g. our proclamationto the men of Baghdad.  l;e propose to liberate Arabia, butwe do not intend to relinquish our claims to special interestsin Mesopotamia.     0, ITALY.  Italy, to my mind, would be the most formidableobstacle.  If Italian jealousy of France cannot be conciliatedno separate peace with Turkey will be possible.  It wouldprobably be better to keep Turkoy in the war against us, thanfor both Turkey and Italy to go out of the v/ar.        2.  Our obli ationsr to the Arabs.  ;?o have repeatedlydeclared that we are fighting for the freedom of small peoplesand that this is not a war of annexations.  This, however, inour own ca3e does not mean that we must forego the work of ahundred years in the Persian Gulf and up ths Tigris.  V;e havepoliced and lighted the Persian Gulf, and wo have opened thsway to trade in Baghdad.  In the Arab State which we proposeto constitute we must have guarantees of order and security.The Turkish scheme proposes the autonomy of the outlyingprovinces.  If thi^ autonomy does not correspond with ourhonourable undertaking to  the Arabs wo cannot make peace.If, on tho other hand, it  does correspond,  we can make poaceon some kind of Egyptian basis.
     In any scheme of this kind the most essentialthing to remember is that Turkish and British values arevery different.  The Turks constantly place an extreme andto us an absurd value upon words and shadows - a Flag, theappointment of a Governor without power, the nomination otan officer without troops nay appoar futile t* us but maybe all-Important to them.  The common denominator betweenourselves and the Turks can be found.  It is merely a questionof thought and machinery, and, if we are to avoid the verygrave risk of a Mesopotamia campaign, of time.  It is thecommon denominator between ourselves and our Allies that iaso much harder to find.     If we go to the French and say that wo propose tokeep iiesopotamia, and Palestine if wo get it, all our pasthelp will count for nothing.     3.  Qur material interests in (A) Mesopotamia and(B) Palestine,   A. MESOPOTAMIA.  In Mesopotamia we cannot surrender ourpre-war peaco interests, nor can wo aurrendor our title toirrigate that country.  Our renunciation must be limited.     It seems to me that in this, as in other questions,can pursue a perfectly logical line with our Allies.  &apos;.e arefighting for the freedom of email nationalities, but wo re-cognise that ;;e cannot put strategical considerations aside.&apos;.o hold, and shall continue to hold, Malta and Gibraltar uponstrategical/                             - 5 -
^  strategical grounds.   In the same way Italy will Tpe entitled  to hold etratogieal points in the Adriatic, but not to annexe  territory of tho nainlain inhabited by an alien race.   So  we should bo justified in annexing, say.  Basra and Bahrein,  but not in annexing Bagdad or Mesopotamia.          &apos;7e might bo able to get the Turks out of tho war without our being compelled to make a material renunciation, &quot;but wo  cennot  get our  Allies to agree upon making an academic sacrifice unless wo make  a real sacrifice.   This is obviously unreasonable and unfclr,  iut it is  the case.          If we dooldod to keep Mesopotamia (if wo oan do so) we night be able to compensate Prance in  Africa,  but wo cannot  compensate Italy,  whoce main fear  is for her  position in the  Mediterranean.     8*   Palestine.    If  we  take Palestine we  must give Syria to Prince.   If we  give Syria  to Prcnoe we must give Smyrna, Konia,  etc.  te  Italy.   But  Palestine is  a question  of trenches,  high  explosivek  etc.    If we repudiate  cur claim to Palestine,  for which wo have  fought, we can ask the  French and the  Italians  to repudiate  thoir olaim to territory  forwhich they have not fought.          If  the Allies had been  ablo  te dictate  thoir own  terms,and could have partltiened the greater part of the OttomanEmpire, what would have been tho result?   It  seems-  to methat we should have driven Balkan quarrels farther Bast,that we should have had gigantic lend frontiers to defend,and have been committed to a vast system of militarism.                           6.
         4..  The  entire  situation and  the  advantage  of getting the  rurks  out of  the war.       .  A.   America  cannot turn the scale in our  favour  before the  spring.         B.   It is  doubtful if  she will  .Jielp us in  Turkey.         C.   It is  impossible to  prophesy  what is  going to happen  in the next offensive,  or during the  winier.  Amongst many uncertainties one  thing is  certain:   The  advantage  of a separate peace with Turkey.         5.  The autumn campaign in Mesopotamia.  In the past we  have habitually under-estimated the  Turks as fighters. We have by now, probably * learnt our lesson, but our Intolli- gance assures us that a gigantio effort is going to be made against us in Mesopotamia in the autumn..   The Turks will leave their country to die, and concentrate  their whole attention upon their array.   Taleet Pesha may believe that it would be profitable to wait until the result of this campaign was apparent.   My own feeling is that,.while heprobably believes in a Turkish victory in Mesopotamia,  he thinks that the war must ultimrtely go against th? Germans,and consequently against all their allies.   In that case noisolated victory in Mecouotemie is going to save  them..             To summarise:-         1.  A body of Turks are anxious to come to  terms withus,  end to bring about f. revolution,        11.   If we can we should take  advantage of this fact,and ,if possible,  see that-e  revolution occurs before theIfalkenhayn offensive.
     III.  To do this we must  (a)  knovf clearly what we wantourselves, and (b)  get the agreement  of our Allies.  Iventure the opinion that at the  present moment we do notclearly know what we want ourselves.     IV.   If we get the luggage it does not very muchnatter if the Turks get the labels.   \hcn Lord hitchenerwas all-powerful in i.gypt his  secretary was wearing a f ezz .. esopotania and lalestine arc  worth a fezz.      V.   If we can agree with  our Allies, a new re-statement of our aims in the hear  East  would probably actas a valuable disruptive force in  3hver&apos;s camp.89th July 1917.
