Of the 4900 cases 3511 were disposed of by the awardof pension, permanent or temporary, 1373 by the grant ofgratuities, and in 16 cases the claims were rejected.   Claimswhich had previously been rejected under former Uarrants wereadmitted in 507 case, 447 of the men being granted gratuitiesand 60 pensions.  The total number of claims previously rejectedwhich have been dealt with up to date is 5433 of which 885 havebeen met by the award of pension and 4546 by gratuities.3.        The Special Tribunal appointed to hear appeals frommen who have been awarded gratuities in place of pensions on theground that the unfitness for which they were discharged wa*neither attributable to nor aggravated by their service, met onthe 27th July to furthor conoidor procedure                  the
 the 27th July to further consider questions of procedure, and the Ministry having agreed to meet all the requests they had put forward as stated in last week&apos;s report, they decided to begin the hearing of cases on the 14th August. 4.        The work of awarding and authorising payment of Widows and Dependants pensions in current cases is completely up to date.          3*002 re-assessments of dependants pensions were made during the week against 3,152 last week and 3,186 the week before.   There remain 36,528 cases to be dealt with (Appendix I.).   The 3,002 cases this week include 646 dependants pensioned under the old Warrant who have benefittedby the re-assessment to the average extent of 3/8 a week, and 566 dependant parents whose cases had been settled by agratuity under the old Warrant but have now been placed onpension at an average rate of 7/5d. a week.   Tho rest of the 3,002 receive no benefit, their pensions already beingequal to pre-war dependance.          As a result of the weekfs re-examinations as toentitlement under the new Warrant, 5 widows not previouslyhelped have been admitted to full pension, and 4 to temporarypension.   263 (widows and dependants) remain to be dealt without of the original total of 4,523.5,        The grants made to wido?fs when they are notified of their husbands&apos; deaths are now being issued at the  5 rateapproved by the Treasury as a modification of the RoyalY/arrant,   The necessary authorities for payment of these grants in cases of death on or after the 1st July, 1916, notifiedbefore the 4th April, 1917, will very shortly be sent to the Pension Issue Office.      ^ 6.        The 17th meeting of the Committee on Institutional Treatment in England and Wales was held on July 26th.   The Report is annexed as Appendix II and may be summarised as follows:-                                   ,    .                                            Paraplegics
      Paraplegics.   Up to June 30th, 1078 Paraplegic caseshad been notified, out of which 912 had been dealt with.Accommodation has been provided in Civil Hospitals for 358cases.   The beds at present in use number 135, leaving 223still available (Appendix III).          The Star &amp; Garter is at present full, and atLonsdale House, ?rtiich is proving a most useful institution,there are 19 patients.          The Paraplegic Home in East Lancashire where thereare at present 20 patients, is reported to be well run and inexcellent order.7.        Arrangements were recently made by the Ministry ofPensions with the War Office for an increase of the Staff ofthe Massage Departments in Military Hospitals in order toprovide out-patient treatment for discharged men.   As theneed for extra staff will fluctuate, it was decided that thedemand should be met locally rather than that continuous Servicemembers of the Military Massage Corps should be engaged.   Theexpenses will be defrayed out of the Funds of the Ministry ofPensions.   The Ministryfs Circular No. 9 of the 25th July(Appendix IV) covering Army Circular No. 891 (Appendix V)communicates the arrangements to Local Committees.8.        A Conference was held on the 27th instant on thedistinction between attributable and non-attributable casesof Lunacy for pension purposes.   A note of the proceedingsis annexed as Appendix VI.9.        At the First Home of Recovery for Neurasthenics,Golders Green, workshops have now been fitted up by theMinistry for providing elementary training in electrical work,motor-engineering, carpentry, and basket-making, the lastnamed specially in connection with the intensive agriculturaltraining at the hospital.    The training is provided as partof the curative treatment, since the men are not in theInstitution long enough to take a full course.   The instructors                                                   commence

Similar facilities for curative  training are beingprovided at the Orthopaedic hospital in Great Portland Street.10.        An interesting report for the quarter ended 30thJune 1917 has been received from the Portsmouth LocalCommittee, which shows that complete arrangements have beenmade through the Assistant Director of Medical Services, wherebydischarged men can be treated at military hospitals withoutdelay, and that the Local Committees have generally made gooduse of the Institutional accommodation at  their disposal.   Thereport shows 42 men under treatment,3 awaiting admission toHospitals and 9 whose treatment has been completed.   Of thelatter only 1 is shown.to have made no improvement, while 5are now working.          The Joint Committee for Hampshire, Berkshire,Buckinghamshire and the Isle of Wight have submitted acomprehensive scheme for Institutional Treatment, and aninterview has been arranged with the Secretary in order todiscuss the modifications required in accordance with theinstructions recently issued by the Minis try*          Provisional sanction has been accorded to the schemesubmitted by the Local Committee for Surrey up to the 31stAugust 1917, in order to obviate unnecessary delay pending thesubmission of their full proposals.          Comprehensive schemes have also been submitted by theLocal Committees for Hertfordshire, Swindon and Tottenham, andsteps are being taken to bring their proposals into line withthe recent instructions.11*        Arrangements have been made with the Local GovernmentBoard to place expert advioe at the disposal of the Ministry                                                 regarding
regarding the various Institutions included in the schemessubmitted by Local Committees.12.       Treatment in 14 special cases not covered bysanction to any general scheme, was approved,by the Ministryin the course^ of the week.                       Training13.       Approval has been given to a scheme submitted bythe Local Committee for Newcastle-on-Tyne for trainingdisabled men in Cinematograph Vfork at the Cowen TrainingSchool.          The Ministry have confirmed the provisionalapproval given to a scheme of the Local Committee forNorwich, for training disabled men in Boot Repairing.   Thisscheme had been reported on by a Conference of therepresentatives of the Norwich Boot &amp;:Shoe ManufacturersAssociation, and of the local branches of the Boot &amp; ShoeOperatives Union.   The conference were of opinion thatthere would be satisfactory openings for men properly trainedbut in view of the large number of men now engaged in Bootrepairing in the Army, they recommended concentration on theteaching of Boot Baking, especially Hand Sewing andFinishing.          The offer of the National Leather GoodsManufacturers Association to train partially disabled menin Light Leather V/ork has been referred to the appropriateTrade Advisory Committee, which has reported favourably onthe proposal, provided that each man receives a total sumof  15 as wages during training and a gift of tools to thevalue of  5 on the completion of the course and it has beendecided to suggest to the London Local Committee that theyadopt this as part of their training scheme,          A scheme submitted by the Local Committee for theIsle of Man for training disabled men as Boot Repairers isunder consideration,                                                      The   ;
          The Ministry are in correspondence with theNottingham Local Committee with regard to a comprehensivescheme for providing classes in Carpentry, Joinery,Engineering, Drawing Office Work, Chemistry, Dispensing andLaboratory Work at the University College, and workshoptraining in Fancy Leather Work and Circular Latch Needle WebKnitting.          It has been decided that facilities should beprovided in the area of the Surrey Local Committee for trainingdisabled men as Ilotor Engineers, Caretakers and Handymen,Electrical Wirers, Masons, Boot Repairers, Tailors, Clerks andOxy-Acetylene Welders;  that the establishment of classes  InPainting and Decorating, Carpentry, Joinery, and FrenchPolishing should be deferred pending the receipt of reports onthese industries from the appropriate Trade Advisory Committees,and that men who desire to be trained as  Upholsterers, Bakers,Toy Makers, Picture Frame Makers, Waiters, Cooks and Hairdressersshould at present be sent to the London centres for instructionin these subjects.          The Northampton Local Committee have made proposalsfor the training of disabled men in Hairdressing.   The wholequestion of the advisability of training men in this industryhas been under consideration in connection with the scheme ofthe Local Committee for Wimbledon and the Ministry of Labour, towhom the matter was referred, have been in consultation withthe President of the Incorporated Guild of Hairdressers, whoIs of opinion that there will be good openings as hairdressersfor disabled men who have been thoroughly well trained, andhas expressed his willingness to give the VieftSf it of his adviceto any Local Committee who may wish to provide facilities fortraining in this process.          Sanction has been given to the training of 18individual men as shown in Appendix VII, and in 35 other casesfurther information has been requested or modifications havebeen suggested.
14.It Is proposed to start at Roahampton a TrainingCourse for men who have lost a limb, in the making ofartificial limbs.   Ken will be Invited to undergo a sixmonths&apos; course of training, and at the end of this period,the firms engaged at Roeharapton will retain them at the standardrate of wages.at the present time is far below the number required,particularly in connection with the different Orthopaedic centresand in view of the fact that the demand for the provision andrepairing of artificial limbs Is likely to be great for the next30 or 40 years, this trade would appear to offer good prospectsfor the permanent employment of disabled men.15.       On July 20th a Conference was held at the Ministrywith General Ruck representing the Civil side of themanufacturing department of the Air Dontitol Board, to consider^the possibility of training disabled officers or men in thework of supervision and direction of Aeroplane manufacture *It was desired to obtain disabled officers and men who,previous to the war, had had a two years1 course in Engineeringand who would be enabled by an additional third yearns trainingto take the special posts referred to.   It was thought thatfacilities for training disabled efficers in this industrymight be provided at Liverpool or Manchester University andfor disabled men at the Northampton Polytechnic Institute.General Ruck undertook to submit detailed proposals.16.       On July 24th the question of training disabled menas teachers in primary and secondary schools was discussedat a Conference between representatives of the War Office,the Board of Education, the Ministry of Labour and theMinistry of Pensions.   It was decided that the Board ofThe number of trained artificial limb makers availableEducation
E*  ducation should depute an Inspector to visit several hospitals, to ascertain by personal enquiry, what number of men were likely to be suitable candidates for admission to  the Training Colleges, where a two years&apos; course at a cost of  80 per head might fit a man of suitable education to fill a post in a secondary or elementary school,&apos;especially if he had some technical knowledge. 17.       An endeavour is being made to ascertain  what occupations are suitable for one armed men and it has been decided to make inquiry of a number of the larger Local Committees as to the number of men so disabled with whom they have had  to deal,  the number of these for whom employment has been found and the permanence of such employment.   Sub-Station work, which was conditionally recommended by the Trade Advisory Committee as a suitable occupation for men with one arm, has lately been pronounced undesirable by the Instructors/at two of the centres at which training in this process is provided, and enquiries are being made into the matter. 18.

It deals with Agricultural Motor Tractor work in England and wales, which is being  organized by . the Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries, with whose approval it has been issued. 19.      Appendix X hereto is the report by Sir A, Griffith Bosoawen on the Inter Allied Conference for the stusd$ of Profession^ al Re-education and other questions of interest to soldiers and sailors disabled by the war which was held at Paris on the 8th to the 12th I-Iay 1917.

Organization.20,       A statement of the proceedings of the StatutoryCommittee for the week ending July 25th, 1917 is annexed(Appendix XI). ,  It omits reference to J-he Health &amp; TrainingSections of that Committee, of which the work in anticipationof the passing of the Transfer of Powers Bill, now before  theHouse of Lords, was transferred to the Ministry on the 19thinstant, and mentions that the parteof the Staff of thebranch of the Statutory Committee, which have hitherto dealtwith  .   Supplementary Pensions to disabled men, widows, etc.,have been formed into an Alternative Pensions Branch to awardpensions under Articles 3  : 13 of the Royal Warrant andRegulations under the Order in Council.   The new branch startedwork on the 23rd instant at the Duke of York&apos;s Headquarters.          The extracts from.the Reports of the Inspectors  ofAccounts show irregularities due to want of proper organizationat Barnsley and Shipley.   The report on the work of theCounty Committee..of Cardigan is most unsatisfactory, and thaton the Radnorshire Committee, who pride themselves on thesmall amount of money they distribute, little better.   BreconCounty ia reported to be one of the best of the sr;-allerCounties, and the work of Pontypridd to be proceeding undergood conditions.21..      The Naval &amp; Military V,ar Pensions etc (Transfer ofPowers) Bill was read a second time in the House of Lords  onthe 25th Instant and passed through Committee and was reada third time there on the 26th.   The only amendments werethoseintroduced at the instance of the Minister to secure  thatthe interest on the funds of the Special Grants Account inuredto the advantage of the Exchequer and to increase the member-ship of the Special Grants Committee from ten to twelve.
22.      The Local Committees of Cheshire agreed at a meetingheld at Crewe on July 13th to the recommendation that they shouldform a Joint Committee and a scheme for the constitution ofsuch a Committee was adopted.23.       The fourth issue of the &apos;./ar Pensions Gazette (AppendixXII) contains a leading article on Training and Trade Unionsby Mr. Harry Gosling, descriptions of the work of the BirminghamLocal Committee, and at the Orthopaedic hospital at ShepherdsBush, and articles on the Voluntary Worker and the new poster                         Staff, etc.24.       Table III shows an addition of 72 to the staff of theministry during the week, 40 having been added to the&apos; Awards toSoldiers Branch, and 28 to the Pension Issue Office.

CQJMITTEE  ON  INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT *              The eighteenth meeting of  the Committee was  held    on Thursday the  26th July  1917, at Westminster House,    Millbank.    Present. Sir Arthur  Griffith Boseawen, the  Hon. Arthur    Stanley and Sir  Walter  Lawrence with Sir  H. Haward,  Dr.  Pox    Symons and Mr * Hore. X. Minutes.   The Minutes of last meeting were  taken as  read and    passed. 2* Paraplegics.  Dr.  Fox Symons reported that  up to 30th  June    1917 he had received notification of 1078 Paraplegic cases    out $f which 912 had &quot;been  dealt with leaving 356 to  be still    dealt with.   Accommodation was provided  for 358 cases and    the beds at present  In  use numbered  135 leaving 223  beds still    at his disposal.  The  Star and Garter Institution at    Richmond was full  at the present  time and Lonsdale House had    nineteen patients  in it.    He was finding this latter    Institution very useful.              Sir Walter Lawrence stated that he had seen  the    Paraplegic Home  in East Lancashire and was  very much impressed    with it.   There were about 20 cases there  and the Institution    was well run and in  excellent order.              A long and general discussion took place relative    to the question  of Pensions and deductions  in the cases  of men    In Military Hospitals,  and Institutions,  and of the  distinction    between permanent  and temporary cases of  treatment.       At the    request of the Committee Mr* Flynn attended the meeting    The Committee finally agreed:-(a) That in the case af  Paraplegics it was not  practicable to    determine  before any treatment had been given whether the    case was curable or  likely to  need permanent  treatment.(b) That all cases should be given treatment  with full allowances    to the men for six months  but  that at the end of that time                                                      the
   the allowances should be reduced and the case treated as a   permanent one unless the Minister was satisfied by a IJedical   Certificate that the case was likely to derive benefit by a   further temporary stay in the Institution.)  $hat in all Paraplegic cases a deduction of 7/- a week from   the mans allowance should be made and applied towards the   cost of his maintenance.   The deduction in the case of the   Star and Garter should be made by the Ministry aid paid to   the Institutioni             Mr. Stanley and Dr. Fox Symons agreed that the   men would not object to this deduction and the Committee was   strongly of opinion that as regards allowances to Paraplegics   they should be uniform for all Institutions to which they   were sent.l)  Pocket money.  The question of what amount was to be allowed   to men in  Institutions was discussed at length and it was   recognised as very desirable in all Paraplegic cases that   taae amount should be the same.             Mr. Hore explained the terms of the  Instruction   for treatment and training and the power of the Minister to   increase or reduce the weekly allowance on the advice of the   Superintendent of the Institution.             Dr. Fox Symons states that in paraplegic cases   the superintendents would certainly advise that 10/- a week   be paid to the man, sad the Committee agreed to this.   The   balance would be credited to him unless he decided  to make   an  allotment to his wife, but in any case he should be   definitely informed that the balance was credited to him if   not so allotted.   It was considered advisable that the   Instruction should be brought to the merfs notice and sent to   those applying to be transferred. 5. It was also agreed that a letter be sent to the Vfar Office                                                    reque sting
requesting that when dischargee paraplegics were being treatedin military hospitals a reduction of l/- a day should be made formaintenance.Mr. Stanley agreed to a letter being written to the Superintendentof the Star and Garter informing him of the foregoing decisions.War Seal Foundation. Dr. H. Fox  Symons presented a report dated26th July on the Scheme of the V/ar Seal Foundation Flats atFulham instituted by Mr. Oswald Stoll.  Sir Arthur Boscawenundertook to discuss the matter with Mr. Barnes.   Hesuggested that Mr. Stoll might be invited to a personal inter-view at a later stage.Epileptics.

MASSAGE  TREATMENT.    SIR,          I am  directed by  the  Minister of Pensions to enclose copy  ofArmy Council Instruction  No. 891,  of 1917, relating  to  the provision  ofout-patient treatment in the form of massage for discharged soldiers in MilitaryHospitals.   It has, as  a rule, been  necessary hitherto to refuse sanction to theemployment of private masseurs, as it has been found that special qualificationsire required owing to  the nature  of the  disabilities for which treatment  issquired.  A special  system has been  developed in the  Military  Hospitals, andlie arrangements now made  by the  Ministry of Pensions with the War Office,is set out in the Army Council  Instruction, will, it is hoped, provide adequatekcilities for disabled  men needing  this  form of treatment in the area of theiocal Committee.I am, Sir,      Your obedient Servant,                                                            Secretary.lie Secretary or Clerk      War Pensions, &amp;c, Local Committee.

It is notified with reference to A.C.I. 449 of 1917 that where the number of out-patients  attending at a  hospital and requiring massage treatment necessitates an increase of the existing massage staff maintained for the purpose of dealing with serving  soldiers, the demand will be met locally, and the charge  in connection with the extra staff will be one for the Ministry of Pensions.    2. It is probable that the  need for extra staff will be intermittent, and for this reason  it has been decided that local arrangements to meet  the  intermittent requirements are preferable to engaging for continuous service members  of the Almeric Paget Military Massage Corps.    3. The 0.0 the hospital will inform the Local Pension Committee of the number of masseuses required, and  they  will arrange  with him, on behalf of the Ministry of Pensions, the rates at  which  they will be paid..   These rates will be fixed according to local conditions, the rate paid by the W. D. to the masseuses of  the Almeric . Paget Military  Massage  Corps for Military Hospitals being  taken  as  a guide, and not exceeded in any case.    The O.C. the hospital will then engage the services  of masseuses locally, at the rate of pay agreed upon, for such employment as may be required, having regard  to the fluctuations in the number of out-patients in need of treatment.   4.  The  O.C. the hospital will render a monthly account to theMinistry of Pensions  of the sums paid from- Army  funds  in  thisrespect for recovery from the Funds of tbe Ministry of Pensions, andwill be responsible that recovery is secured.                                      24/Gen.

 (1) The first meeting of the Conference  took place at the Offiices cf the Board of Control on the 27th instant.   There were present.:- Br, Marriott Cooke, Mr. Trevor and Dr. Bond, representing the B^ard of Control; General Russell and Colonel Turner representing the War Office, Surgeon-General H, Norman Director General of the Medical Department, R.N., and Dr, Cralg, nominated by the President of the Royal College of Physicians, Mr Hore representing the Ministry of Pensions, (2)     The Conference agreed unanimously on the recommendation of the Board of Control that measures should at once be taken &quot;to prevent enlistment of mentally unsound men and to facilitate the early removal from the Ariay of men suffering from unsoundness ofmind which had been overlooked at the medical examination prior tc enlistment&quot;, (3)     With regard to the criteria to be applied in determiningwhether -insanity should be regarded as attributable to War Serviceor not it was agreed that it would in the firset instance be of service to the- Miniate*/ tc determine tfce^dlasses of case which should not be regarded &amp;* so attributable and after prolonged discussion the following three main principles were agreedunanimous ly: -        (a) A man should net be regarded as pensionable if definite          evidence is forthcoming that the man was subject to          insanity (including Idiocy, advanced imbecility and moral          imbecility) at the time he joined the service,        (b) A man should not be regarded as pensionable if definite          evidence is forthcoming that he had before enlistment had          at least one attack of certified insanity and there is at          the same time no evidence that the circumstances of his          military service aggravated his disability.        (c) For the purpose of Article 9, of the Warrant a man          should not be regarded as pensionable if during the port:          which has elapsed since his discharge from the Army he        ,  has been able to follow any ordinary civilian life ard nc          pecasioh can reasonably be traced between the attack of          insanity in the man previous to his naval or military          seryice*                 APPENDIX VI,.                                   ^CpJFEEXNGE ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ATTRIBUTABLE ANDNON-ATTRIBUTABLE CiSES OF LUNACY FOR PENSION PURPOSES,
 (4)     The Conference agreed that as regards  cases  of insanity which  could be  connected directly or  indirectly with some other factor,  e.g*, cases of general paralysis of the  insane,  epilepsy,  or alcoholism, further consideration is necessary to determine whether any specific criteria could be applied and this will be discussed at a further meeting on the  3rd proximo. (5)     Colonel  Turner submitted to the Conference a  series of questions which he proposed should be inserted in a form of report  to be made by a Medical Board on a case of insanity and it was generally agreed that the detailed questions of this nature would be of service and would bemore properly determined when the general principles hadbeen arrived at.

It will be observed that men who  prove  suitable for  this work  will, for thepresent, be employed  by the Board of Agriculture and  Fisheries through theirlocal tractor representatives in the various counties.    For such men the  Board will provide locally  a  short course of training in theactual processes  of tractor driving and ploughing.   The Board will have their ownorganization for  supervision  and repairs, both  during the training and during theafter employment, and the arrangements will be such as to give reasonable prospectthat  the men will acquire, during their  employment by the Board,  the additionalskill  necessary to qualify them for private employment afterwards, including thecare  of the machine.    It is  strongly  recommended, however, that  wherever practicable the  shortcourse provided by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries should be regarded as thesecond stage  of training, and should  be preceded by a course of theoretical andpractical  instruction in motor driving,  repairs, &amp;c, at a  technical institute.  Itis hoped that Local Committees will endeavour to arrange for such courses in suitablecentres.    In the case of ordinary labour the training provided by the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries will be very short, perhaps during a few days only.  But for a disabledman it will often be desirable that the course should  be longer, even when it followsa period in a technical school, in order that he may be gradually accustomed to theWork.  For this  purpose the maintenance allowance under Article 6 of the RoyalWarrant or Order in Council may be paid until the man  is certified  to be fullytrained, up to a maximum period of three months.    Whichever method  of training is proposed the  final selection of the men forthe work will rest with the local officers of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,and it is desirable, therefore,  that the Local Committee should get into touch withthe tractor representative  of  the Board&apos;for the county.   They should  supply himfrom  time  to time  with lists of the  men they consider likely to prove suitable;giving names, addresses, and full particulars of capabilities and previous experience,&amp;c.  They should let him know whether the men are ready to present themselvesimmediately  for  provisional&apos;  selection for the course of training provided by  theBoard, or  (if  they are going  first to a preliminary technical school training) whenthey will be ready.  They should ascertain from him what will be provided, wherespecial arrangements are necessary, in  the way of transport to work or accom-modation  near at  hand,  and  what  the  wages  after training  will  be.   Theyshould draw his attention to their power to pay for maintenance during the course,including such extended period of training as may be required as the result of themen&apos;s disabihties, and should ask him to supply them with the necessary reportson the attendance of the men at the training and to  inform them in each case whenthe training is complete.

     A list of the names and addresses of the tractor representatives in the various counties will be circulated shortly.     It is believed that Local Committees frequently receive applications from men who wish to be trained as chauffeurs.  Such  men should, if suitable, be informed of these openings in motor tractor work, as also should men who desire an open air life in the country.     I am directed to  add that the series  of  Reports upon  Openings in Industry suitable  for disabled sailors and soldiers will in future be placed on sale.

PREFACE.   This report is one of a series which is being drawn up by theEmployment Department of the Ministry of Labour in collabora-tion with the War  Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee.   Theinformation is intended not  only for  the use of  Local  WarPensions Committees, Employment Exchanges, Technical Schoolsand Institutes, and Military  Hospitals, but also for the use ofemployers and workpeople and  any who are interested in theproblem of the disabled  sailor and soldier.   This Report has been issued with the approval of the Board ofAgriculture and Fisheries.  Any further questions with regard to this report should beaddressed to the Ministry of Labour, Employment Department(Disabled Sailors  and Soldiers),  Queen Anne&apos;s Chambers, West-minster, S.W. 1.       AGRICULTURAL MOTOR TRACTOR WORK.                     GENERAL REMARKS.  The use of motor machines for farm work is in  its infancy inthe United  Kingdom, but  it is  likely to develop considerably.The best types of machines can be used both as moving tractors(for ploughs,  reapers, &amp;c, and  for  drawing  carts to market),and also as  stationary power  engines for cutting,  turning grist-mills, &amp;c.  As  continuous cropping is also likely  to be largely  increasedthe industiy will  probably offer a steady and secure field of eni-ployment.   It has been  estimated that a large number of thosewho cultivate even medium-sized farms will  in the near futureuse a  motor  and employ  a man to look after it.   If so, there willbe  permanent employment for  several  thousand men in  thisindustry.   At  the present time the work is being organised in England bythe Board of  Agriculture.   There are openings for at least athousand men, and suitable men  will probably find work in theirown counties.  The  question how far  these  openings  could befilled  by disabled men is discussed at the conclusion of the  nextsection.        SUITABILITY OF  THE WORK FOR DISAISLED MEN.   The work for which men are  required immediately is tractorploughing and this is, of  course, likely to be a very importantpart of the  permanent work of the tractor after the  war.  As ageneral rule this requires two men, one on the tractor and one onthe plough.   They should b* capable of changing places and of
216 helping  one another,  and both men should not have the same disabilities.   In selecting suitable men regard  should  be  had to both these processes.   Owing, however, to the variety of machines in use, it is impossible to  say with certainty exactly what  disablements would disqualify.   Moreover, the  types  of machine  and  the methods of working are still  to some extent in an  experimental stage.   The tractor driver is xisually seated.   He is subject to  a good deal of noise and  vibration.  The steering is harder work than on an ordinary motor; in some types there is considerable resistance, in others the steering wheel has to be spun rapidly with one hand when turning, and spun  back again when the turn is  finished. Continuous attention is needed to keep  a straight line; but  the pace  is slow, and sharp  curves only occur at intervals.    The reversing lever has also to be operated.   The  starting handle is considerably harder to work than that of an ordinary car.   The driver must  be able to reach over to get at parts  that require adjustment.   The ploughman rides on the plough; he is subject to oscillation. He has to work several levers usually one  for steering, and one on each side for raising or lowering the plough-shares, and some- times one for determining the number of shares in operation at the same time, which may vary from one to four.   These levers often require considerable strength and a wide hand grip.  But, as in the tractor  driving, the special muscular exertion is only needed at intervals.   With some types of machine the work could be done quite satis- fotorily by a man with an artificial leg below the knee,  provided that he were fairly active.   Generally speaking, it may  be said that, for the two processes, full xise of both hands and arms is needed.  But the loss of  one or two fingers would probably be no great obstacle,  so long as the hands  were sufficiently sound to grip well and to  tighten bolts, &amp;c, connected with the machinery.  Only  moderately good  sight and  hearing are required.  Thework is fairly heavy in character, and involves considerable noise and vibration. There is  little liability to accident.  The following  grouping may be of assistance in a provisionalselection of men for this work:       (1) Men sound in limb  and muscularly strong,  but disabled           from their previous occupations by the after effects of           shell shock,  gas poisoning, neurasthenia, or tubercu-           losis, provided that they can,  after suitably graduated           training, do a  full  day&apos;s work in the open; especially           men already  experienced in other  classes of  motor           driving, but unable to  return to their former occupa-           tion owing to their  inability to bear the strain of           driving where  much traffic is concerned.(11389-14 a.)  Wt. 8780-G 86.  4000. 7/17.  D &amp; S. Q. 4.
     (2) Men suffering from  specific,injuries, including, e.g., an           artificial leg below the knee, but having the full use           of both shoulders, arms,  and hands.         SUMMARY OF  CONCLUSIONS  AS TO SUITABILITY.   The advantages of the work are that it is done in the open airand at a  sloiv  pace, and  that it offers openings in a branch ofagricultural  employment  which is comparatively new,  whichrequires specialised training, and in which, therefore, the new-comer will not be taking the place  of  skilled men who aretemporarily absent at  the  war.   Against these advantages  must be set the fact that the workitself is. often heavy and is subject to noise, vibration and, fumes,especially in the case  of the older types cf machine.   It must,however,  be remembered that considerable further  improvementsin the type of machine are  probable.  There is also  at presentsome uncertainty  as to the  extent  to  which men in charge oftractors  could ultimately,  when in   private  employment,  beengaged wholly on this icork, or would, be expected to do otherfarm work in the  intervals.   There is considerable difference of opinion as to how far dis-abled men, either in class (1) or in class  (2), mentioned above,would prove suitable  for  the work.  In the absence of actualevidence,  it is  suggested that experiments should be made withcarefully  selected  men from both classes.   The technical schoolmethod of training (method  (b) described below) is-particularlyrecommended for  this purpose;  since  the training  thus  givenwould be of value in connection with motor and other engineeringwork,  even  if  the disabled  man proved unsuitable  for  tractorwork.   In any  case, the physical  difficulties would be lessened,  if theearly work on the  tractor and plough is suitably  graduated to thecapacity of the man.                          TRAINING.  The length of training needed depends largely upon the  pre-vious experience of the men concerned.   A man already qualifiedas a motor driver  should be able to  learn the special mechanismof a tractor in from 5 to 10 days.  A man with no previous  know-ledge of motors could learn to drive  in  about the same time, butwould hardly become proficient, in the sense of being able not onlyto drive but also to keep the  machine in order, in less  than three-months.  In either case the management of the  plough would bepart of the training.  The work could be learnt by an intelligent man even if formerlyaccustomed to unskilled work, but any  mechanical knowledge orexperience of farm- work,  especially of ploughing, would be ofvalue.
  Two alternative methods of training will  soon  be in opera-tion:      (a) A short course of training in  actual driving and plough-           ing  provided locally  by  the  Board  of Agriculture           through its  local  Tractor  Representatives,  with  a           guarantee  of immediate temporary local employment           at the end of the course by  the Board itself, which will           provide  its  own  organisation  for  supervision and           repairs.  The arrangements made  by the Board will           be such as to ensure a reasonable prospect that the men           employed by them after this elementary training will           acquire, during their period of employment by the           Board,  the additional skill necessary to  qualify them           for permanent private employment  afterwards, includ-           ing  the care of the machine.    (b) A  course  of  theoretical  and  practical training  at  a           technical school for three months; followed by a short           course of  actual  driving  and  ploughing under the           local Tractor Representative of the Board of Agricul-           ture as in (a).            At the Battersea Polytechnic a three months&apos; course           has  been in operation for  some time for training dis-           abled sailors and  soldiers  in motor tractor work and           ploughing,  including a knowledge of the theory of           the motor engine,  and such workshop processes as will           enable a man to take charge of the machine and  do           ordinary repairs.   This course has been approved  hy           the  Statutory  Committee.   A few other Local  War           Pensions Committees are arranging for similar experi-           niental courses in  connection with  local  technical           schools.               Maintenance during Training.  Under Article b&apos; of the Royal Warrant of the 29th March, 1917,an allowance of 27s. Qd. (more if he has been a non-commissionedofficer) is given to a disabled man while  going through any courseof training approved by the Statutory Committee, with additionalallowances for children at the rate of 5s. for the first, 4s. 2d. forthe second, &apos;3s. 4*Z. for the third, and 2s. 6d. for each subsequentchild, and if this training necessitates his living away from homeand he is married a further allowance of 13s 9d.  (more if he hasbeen a non-commissioned officer) is  given for  his wife  togetherwith children&apos;s allowances at the  rate  mentioned above.  If hehas supported any  dependant up to the time when his  trainingcommenced assistance will be given to that dependant.   In addi-tion to this any fees in respect of the training will be paid by theMinister, and at the end of it an amount equal to 5s.  for eachweek the  training lasted if he has satisfactorily attended it  willbe given to the man as a bonus.11389B
                   EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN.  Before tlie war  practically  no  women or young persons  wereemployed in this work, and very few are employed at the presenttime.                           WAGES.  It is probable that the minimum wage paid will not be lessthan from 35s. to 40.?. per week.               METHOD OF OBTAINING TRAINING .  As already explained  above, the English Board  of Agriculturehopes within a short time to be able to offer facilities for trainingand employment in a large number of counties.  Disabled men in England and Wales who desire training shouldapply  to the Local War Pensions Committee for  the district inwhich  they live or to the Local Employment Exchange.Printed under the authority of  His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office    By DARLING AND SON,  LIMITED, BACON STREET, E:2.

                          REPORT.          BY SIR ARTHUR GRIFFITH EOSCAWEN, M..P. 7!o i/ie Minister of Pensions.   SIR,       IN accordance with, your instructions I attended the Inter- Allied Conference for the Study of Professional Re-education and other  questions which  are of interest  to  Soldiers and  Sailors disabled by the War, which, took place at Paris from May 8th to 12th.                                   :  &apos;            .   The other representatives of the Ministry were:- .       Lord Charnwood.       Lieut-Col. Sir Berkeley Moynihan, C.B., M.S., F.R.C.S.,           R.A.M.C.       Lieut.-Col.  E. A. Stanton, C.M.G. (Secretary, Statutory           Committee).       Sir Charles Nicholson, Bart.,  M.P., Chairman, Disable-           ment  Sub-Committee of the London War Pensions           Committee.       Major R. Mitchell, Adviser to the Ministry of Pensions on           Training.   In  addition Surgeon-General Russell.  C.B.,  R.A.M.C.,  repre- sented  the  War  Office on  behalf  of  Li out.-Get). Sir  Alfred Keogh, G.C.B., D.G.M.S.   Fleet  Surgeon  Percy  H.  Boyden,  R.N.,  represented  the Admiralty.   Col. Stewart and  Captain J.  Campbell  Maclure, C.A.M.C.r represented  the British  Red Cross Society.   Lieut.-Col. Finlay, C.A.M.C., represented Canada. .   Miss J. Heyneman  was also present  as a member, of the Inter- Allied Committee.                                .  On   the   invitation   of  the  Ministry  the  following  also- attended : -  Cols. Joseph Cowen, Sir Thomas Oliver, Joseph Reed and John- stone Wallace of the &quot; Joseph and Jane Cowen &quot; Training School for, Maimed Soldiers  and Sailors, Newcastle-6n-Tyne; and Mr. J.  Si  Samuel,  Hon.  Secretary of the Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers, Erskine House, near Glasgow.  The Conference was organised by a Franco-Belgian Committee under  the  Presidency of Baron de Brocqueville,  the Belgian Minister of  War,  whose place at the Conference was actually taken  by the Belgian Minister of the Interior.  It was formally opened in the presence of the President of the French Republic. on the afternoon of May 8th.  It was unfortunate that the preliminary arrangements were verj imperfect so far  as  the Ministry was concerned,  and that no invitation had been extended to the Ministry  to  contribute anypapers for discussion.  The result was  that no single paper fromany British  representative appeared in the volume issued  at  the   C11999) Wt. 16253-0 32. 12,000. 7/17. D &amp; S.

 opening of the  Conference  except a very valuable paper by Sir Alfred Keogh.  The representatives of the Ministry had agreed, however, to write papers and to have them read at the Conference as follows:       (1)  General Policy of  the Ministry of  Pensions Lt.-Col.           Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen.     (2)  The Work of the London Disablement Sub-Committee            Sir Charles Nicholson.     (3)  Treatment, especially Orthopaedic Treatment, of Disabled           Men Sir Berkeley Moynihan.     (4)  Training Major Mitchell.  This  programme was carried out, though in some cases diffi-culty was experienced in finding opportunity for the reading ofthe papers.  The Conference  was divided into six sections, and there werealso opportunities of visiting hospitals and schools of re-educationin Paris and the neighbourhood.   I endeavoured to arrange  thatso far as possible  the  various  representatives  of the  Ministryshould attend different sections and also visit  different hospitals,&amp;c.  Thus,  Sir Charles Nicholson  and myself attended the sixthsection &quot;  The documentation  and propaganda  of matters relat-ing to the disabled.&quot; Sir Berkeley Moynihan attended the first,&quot; Physical Re-education,&quot;  or  &quot; Treatment &quot; as we should  callit;  Major  Mitchell  and Colonel Stanton the second, &quot; Profes-sional  Re-education &quot;  or   &quot; Training,&quot;  and  also  the fourth,&quot;Economic and Social Interests  of the Disabled&quot;;  and LordCharnwood the third, &quot; The  Placing and Employment of DisabledMen in  Civil Life.&quot;  Unfortunately, none  of  us attended thefifth section, which  had to  do with  the blind, but though it isundoubted  that  blinded soldiers are well cared for in France, Ido not think there is anything superior or  even so good  there asthe system of treatment and training provided at St.  Dunstan&apos;sunder the auspices of Sir Arthur Pearson,  an opinion which isconfirmed in the annexed report of  Colonel Stanton and MajorMitchell, who visited the Blind Hostel in Paris.  The various sections conducted their business  on the morningof the 8th, the morning and  afternoon of the 9th, and the morningof the 10th, and on the afternoon of the 11th a very long sittingof the whole Conference took place at  which the reports of thevarious sections  were considered, and no less than 102 resolutionswere carried.  Of  these  it is  sufficient  to say that the majorityappear to be applicable to France alone or to France and Belgium,Tjoany are of a theoretical and abstract character,  some are merely pious opinions,  and only  comparatively few are applicable toconditions in Great Britain.  It must not be supposed from this, however, that the meetingsof the Conference  and its various  sections were useless.  On thecontrary, I think that the discussions in the sections and the frankinterchange of opinions in conversation between men and womenof the several nations deeply interested in the questions under dis-cussion were very  valuable.  I attach much more importance tothem than  to the actual resolutions.  In addition to this, we had
 the opportunity of visiting several of the hospitals and-training establishments in and  around Paris.   Among  those  visited by members of the British Delegates  were:-     The Grand Palais;     The Military Hospital at St. Maurice;     The Military Hospital  and Training Institution  at  Maison       Blanche.     The Blind Hostel, Rue Reuilly;     The Hospital of St. Louis;     The Orthopaedic Hospital at Grignon; and the     Belgian School for the Re-education of Disabled  Soldiers at       PortVillez.   These visits were exceedingly interesting.   I  have received reports from Sir Berkeley Moynihan, Capt. I. Campbell  McClure,  Fleet-Surgeon Boyden,  Colonel Stanton, Major  Mitchell, Lord  Charnwood, Sir C. Nicholson, and  the representatives of the Training Schoolat  Newcastle-upon-Tyne which I annex.   I  do not think that I need do more myself than to summarise some of the main conclusions arrived at in these reports, so far as they are confirmed by my own experiences:     (1) Interest  in the subject.    I was struck  very much with the  great  interest  which the subject evoked.   Representatives of France,  Belgium,  Russia,   Portugal,  Italy,  and   Serbia took  active part  in the  discussions,  and  in  addition to this, the   Conference  was - largely   attended,   showing   that   the &quot; Re-education  des  Mutiles de  la  guerre,&quot;  as  the  French call   it, is  recognised by a  great  section  of  the  French public  as  a most  urgent  and  important  social  problem.    As M. Leon Bourgeois said at  the opening  of the Conference, there is a  &quot; solidarite morale&quot;  among the  Allied  nations.   It  is possible that in this country we  have somewhat lagged behind in the recognition of its importance, partly no doubt  in consequence of the fact that at tho beginning of the war our losses were very much  smaller than  those  of the  French,  and  that we did not anticipate  our large army and heavy  casualties.  It is  hoped that the recent policy  of  the  Ministry of Pensions, especially the provisions  of the new  &quot;Warrant and the institution of Joint Disablement Committees operating over large areas of the country, will  go far towards removing the initial want  of interest,  and will  bring home to  the  people generally  the  urgency  of  the question.   (2) As regards treatment I  can only speak,  of course,  as a layman, but so far as our hospital services and methods are con- cemed, I came to the conclusion that we have not much to learn. I would, however,  call  particular  attention to the notes  on the French organisation for the &quot; prothesis &quot;  of disabled soldiers, and  the suggestions contained  in Sir Berkeley  Moynihan&apos;s valuable report.  In one  important  respect  the  practice  in France and among the Belgians  differs  from our own.   No man  is discharged  from the Army until his cure is complete,so far as this  is possible.   When.I was pointing out  in  my section  the  inducements  offered   by  Article  6  of   the  new
 Warrant . to  discharged  men  to  undergo  further treatment. and  the  penalty  for refusal  imposed  by  Article  4,  the French   and   Belgian   members  of   the   section   could not   understand  what I  had  in  view.   Treatment,   they said, is  &quot; re-education fonctionelle,:, and  that  is all  completed before the  man is discharged.   Therefore, the  man is still under discipline and  can  be compelled to undergo  it.  I know that this question  has been discussed frequently with the War Office, who  have stated that they are unable to retain disabled men for  a longer time in the Army than they do at  present, but I think it; my.duty to record the fact that the French and Belgian military   authorities accept  a  larger responsibility  for the  dis- abled, and, at all events, profess to retain them until they require no further treatment either as in-patients  or  out-patients.  Thus the danger of men going back to work before they are  physically fit to do  so, whereby  health may be permanently impaired, is avoided.   The only cases where treatment after discharge is said to take place in France or Belgium are those in which a  man&apos;s condition gets worse after he leaves the Army.  (3) Training or &quot; Re-education Pro fens ion elle.&apos;&apos; Th e greatest amount  of  interest   is taken in  this  by  the  French,  the Belgians and so far as I can judge by all the Allies.  JNfot only areworkshops attached to  all the French and  Belgian hospitals,  butalso  there are large establishments specially set up for re-educa- tion.   We visited what is perhaps  the finest example of  these,viz., the  &quot; Institut Militaire Beige des  Mutiles,  Invalides  etOrphelins &quot; at Port-Villez, which has been built on a magnificentsite  overlooking the Seine half-way between Paris  and Rouen,and accommodates about 1,300 disabled men.   Here are the mostcomplete installation of electrical and other appliances  for ortho-pasdic  treatment and some 30 separate workshops where  almostevery conceivable  trade is taught.   Training is compulsory,  asit is in  all French, Belgian and Italian  hospitals, the  doctorhaving the principal voice in deciding what trade the  man is tolearn, and being guided naturally by considerations  of the cura-tive  quality of various forms of manual training in each case.As is remarked in several of the papers which I  attach, the manhimself appears  to have little voice in deciding his future,  whilea battle royal behveen the doctor  and the  technical expert oftenrages over his mutilated  body.   Here, again,  the  practice  inFrance,  Belgium. and  Italy differs from our own  in the factthat the  training in the hospitals  is compulsory (on the  adviceand under the supervision  of the doctor), whereas  it is not coni-pulsory in this country, even in orthopaedic aud limbless hospitalswhich  have  workshops attached.   I am  told, however,  by thosewho  have experience of these hospitals,  that better results  areobtained  by allowing the training to be voluntary and by appeal-ing to the good sense of the  men. which may be so; and I recognisefully the disciplinary.difficulty involved in punishing a man whohas lost a limb  for refusing training.  I have also some doubtsas to how far it is really enforced in France in practice.  In anycase,  compulsory training ceases  in France  and  Italy as soonas the man  is discharged  from the Army.  With the  Belgians
 it  is. different; there is, unhappily, no  Belgium  for them to;go back to, the State, therefore, has to maintain them,&apos; and this being so, it compels training so long as it is  considered that the man requires it.  In  France and Italy, however, as ;soon as the man is  discharged from  the Army he is free to do as he  likes, and can and  does  refuse -further training exactly  as he does here. Shortly before the  Conference opened,  a very important  paper was issued by the French Minister of Education, pointing out the extreme difficulty of getting discharged soldiers  to  avail  them- selves  of the  opportunities offered.   Here are  some extracts from it:         &quot; Very many disabled soldiers refuse to avail themselves     of the  facilities for &apos; re-education professionelle &apos;  offered  to     them, either in consequence of their listening to false ideas     which are current, or through ignorance of the good results     obtained in the schools.  Some persist in believing, in spite     of assurances  reiterated  over and over  again,  that the     pension is  reduced  in consequence of re-education;  others     seem to think that the fact  that they have  been wounded     gives them  a right to employment by the  State.  /  .   .     Others, again,  are tempted by the offer of obtaining good     wages immediately, and accept employment which is  bound     to be temporary only.  Lastly, there are some who despair     altogether of ever being  able  again to undertake manual     labour, not realising the great improvements which can be     produced in  their condition by training.       &quot; We must endeaArour to  dissipate  these  prejudices and    this ignorance by a vigorous propaganda.  We must  carry     it on among  the wounded men while they remain in hospital    and when they have left it without having been trained.  We     must carry  it  on  among  their  families, who,  profoundly     moved by the fate which awaits the disabled  soldier, forget,     even  when they are  not  ignorant  of it,  the organisation     which exists for improving their condition.   .   .  .       &quot;Beyond  all  things, we must make it  quite  clear that    neither the life pension nor  the renewable pension can be    reduced in consequence of re-education.       &quot;These  are the  actual  terms of the Act  passed by the    Chamber  of  Deputies (Art. 9).  The discharged  soldier  is    certain  of receiving the whole of his life pension, even when    he has  been  put in a position by means of re-education to    earn wages equal to, or greater than what he earned before.       &quot; And in the  same way the amount of the: temporary pen-    sion, which is always subject to revision, depends in no way    on his training, but solely on his physical condition.  In    deciding whether the temporary pension should be continued    at the same  rate, or  diminished, or  converted  into a: life    pension, the  discharged soldier is not asked whether he has    been re-educated or not, he is examined simply as to whether    he has recovered, and  in what degree he has  recovered, the    use of his arm,  his leg, &amp;c.&quot;   &apos;        -  All this might have been written by our Ministry of Pensions.It shows that the French have to contend with exactly the same   11999                                               A 4
difficulties as we have; and while they could not understand whywe required inducements  to men to undergo further treatmentand penalties for refusal,  they were greatly struck with the pro-visions Of Article 6 of the Warrant with regard to training, whichthe President of the 6th Section, M. Honourat, a member of theChamber of Deputies, described as &quot; magnificent.&apos;&apos;   (4) Employment. I cannot do better as regards  this  side ofthe  question  than  refer  to  the  excellent reports  of LordCharnwood and  of the  Newcastle representatives.  From theseit is clear that the French have  many of the same difficulties aswe have, and do not possess our admirable organisation of LocalCommittees.  The  only  assistance of this kind available  is thatof certain voluntary Associations more or less akin to the Soldiers&apos;and Sailors&apos; Help  Society.  There appears also, to be  a  certainamount  of  friction between the  French  War Office  and otherGovernment Departments concerned with the question.  There isalso the Labour difficulty arising in France as to the wages to bepaid to disabled men at work and while they are being trained.which has not been satisfactorily solved.  One small but importantpoint came under my notice.  The Newcastle representatives callattention in their report to the possibility of insurance companiescharging higher  rates of workmen&apos;s compensation insurance fordisabled soldiers than for workmen  who  are fit in  every way,since the former are more likely to meet with accidents, especiallywhen there is &quot;machinery running.  By a law recently passed inFrance,  an employer does not  pay a higher  rate for a disabledman, the State paying the difference out of a fund created by aspecial tax on  all employers.   This appears to be an  altogetheradmirable arrangement,  facilitating the  employment of woundedsoldiers,  which is  worthy of  consideration here.*    Speakinggenerally,  however, the conditions in France are so  dissimilarto those in England, the former being preponderatingly an agri-cultural  country, that the  problems of re-employment in the twocountries can hardly be compared.  The great question in Franceis to get the men back to the land.  (5) Government  action  and  responsibility generally. I  wasvery much struck with the fact that the institution of the singleMinistry of Pensions, co-ordinating all questions relating  to dis-charged  disabled soldiers,  appealed  to the Allied delegates  as amost excellent  plan,  the importance  of which they had notrealised before.  In France,  several  departments War, Labour,   Education,Trade, Interior, &amp;c. are concerned, and there is in  consequencea good  deal  of complaint  about  overlapping, friction,  &amp;c, andthe difficulty of getting necessary things  done.   An attempt atco-ordination was indeed made recently by the establishment of abody called &quot; The National Office,&quot; but  it  does  not  appear  * It is only fair to the principal British Insurance Companies to state thatthey have publicly announced that any soldier or sailor employed, even ifdisabled and whether discharged or not, is included in their Policies without anyaddition to the ordinary rate of premium for the Trade.
to have been altogether successful.  The same is true of the othercountries,  with the  exception  of  Belgium,   where  the  con-ditions are simple,  as  mentioned above,  and where, apparently,the War Office takes sole charge.  But in this country we havealso  the  immense  advantage of  the Local  War Pensions  Com-mittees, a system which, however, would probably be  impossiblein a  highly centralized country like France.  With regard to thescale of pensions, we are far ahead of any of our Allies,  especiallysince the issue  of  the new Warrant.    A Class I. pension inFrance, with corresponds to our highest degree or total disable-lnent pension, amounts to 18-75 francs only a week for a private,as compared with 275. Qd. here.  Sir Charles Nicholson deals witlithe question in his Report, and draws special attention to the factthat in France pensions  are not paid weekly  as ours are, butquarterly  in   arrear,  an  arrangement  which  leads   to  muchhardship  at the  commencing  period.   It is only fair to theFrench nation to add that they contemplate  an early revisionof  the  scale  of   pensions,  and  I  think  that  one.  of theresults  of  our visit  will be  to  arouse  considerable   inter-est  in  the  terms  of   our   new  Warrant-.   There  is  oneimportant  feature  in  it  which  the  French and  Belgian  dele-gates in the 6th Section  entirely  disapproved of,  and,  indeed,failed to  understand,  and that  is  the  alternative  pension.They took  their stand  on the  principle of  absolute equality,and  argued  that  for the  same hurt there  should  always bethe  same money compensation,  irrespective of a man&apos;s  circuni-stances.    The argument that  a totally  disabled man who  couldearn nothing after  the war, but who before the war was  earning  3  a week, had made  a  greater  sacrifice  than a  similarlydisabled man who  before the war was earning only  1 a week,did not appeal to them in the least.   &quot; Both have lost an arm anda  leg,&quot; they said,  or  &quot; both have been  blinded,&quot;  or  &quot; both  aretotally paralysed,&quot; therefore they should have  the same pensions.They thought that  we Avere, as usual,  generous but illogical, andI  do not think that they will ever appreciate our standpoint anymore than we shall  subscribe to their  doctrine  of abstract&quot; egalite.&quot;  The Conference, however, agreed to give the  ques-tion further consideration in special cases vide Resolution  24.   (6) Future Inter-Allied  Action. A good deal was said at theConference as to the possibility of future common action amongthe  Allies, and several of the  resolutions recommend  it especi-ally 22, 98, 99, 100, 102.   The last-named resolution recommendsthe creation of a permanent Inter-Allied Committee which wouldpossibly ^ prepare the way for  future conferences.   I cordiallyagree with the suggestion, and think that another Conferencemight be valuable, when the results of further experience  couldbe examined.   It was suggested by  several of  the delegates thatit might take place in London.  In the  meantime, I beg to callattention to Resolution 98, which proposes the establishment ofan Inter-Allied Bureau of Information on all  questions relatingto the pensions, treatment, training, and employment of men dis-abled in the war, and that until this is done the Allied Govern-ments should forward  all such information in  their possession to
the French Statistical Office in Paris, which  would undertake tocodify it and publish it for  the  general benefit  of the Govern-ments concerned.  In  addition to the reports sent  to me by  the other members ofthe British delegation,  I annex:      (1)  The resolutions of the Conference;    (2)  A paper explaining the most recent  legislation in Italy          on the question;    (3)  A description of the  Belgian School  of Re-Education at          Port-Villez.  I desire to  conclude by expressing the thanks of all the Britishdelegates  for .the  great kindness  with  which  we were  treatedby the Franco-Belgian  Committee and by  all who were  respon-sible  for the  management of the  Conference  during our  stay atParis, and for the excellent arrangements made for  our visitsto the various hospitals  and schools of re-education.I have the honour to be. sir,                Your obedient servant,                    ARTHUR  GRIFFITH-BOSCAWEN.Rt.

APPENDIX  I.(1)  NOTE  OX  THE FRENCH  ORGANISATION  FOR  THE  &quot; PROTHESIS &quot;  OF    SOLDIERS INJURED IN  THE WAR,  AVITH  SUGGESTIONS FOR  THE IMPROVE-    MENT  OF OUR OWN.             By SIR BERKELEY MOYNIHAN, C.B.,  F.R.C.S.  With the objects  of hastening the  application  of  artificial limbs tomaimed soldiers, of  standardising the  various  types  of  apparatus, andof securing to the wounded and to the State all the necessary  guaranteesin  the  making  and  use  of  appliances,  the &quot; Service  de  Sante &quot; hascreated:      1.  A commission for the study of orthopaedic questions.    2.  An  organisation   controlling  the   making  and  application  of          apparatus.    3.  Centres for orthopaedic treatment,  and  re-education.  1. The  Commission  for  the  study  of orthopaedic questions,  consists ofphysicians and surgeons skilled in the  management of orthopaedic  eases,and of  surgical  instrument makers.  The  Commissioners choose the  typesof apparatus  required by  those who  have lost a limb, discuss  and decideupon the  design of the artificial limbs, and  settle the price  to  be  chargedto the State.  2. The  organisation directing the manufacture of all apparatus  is re-presented in each region  to which an orthopaedic centre is attached, bya permanent  Committee   of Control,  whose  duty  it  is  to  supervise  thedesign  and construction of apparatus by those  makers who supply arti-ficial limbs of any kind,  and by a committee which  receives  the apparatuswhen finished, sees  that  it  is well and properly made and that it  fitsperfectly  the limb  to which  it  is to  be  applied.   The  Committee  isempowered  to accept or return any  apparatus.  3. The  centres for providing artificial  limbs and for  re-education  areeleven  in  number and  are  found  in Paris, Tours, Rennes,  Chermont,Ferrand,  Lyons, Marseilles, Montpellier,  Bordeaux, Nancy, and  Algiers.Each consists of:       (a) Hospitals with a  service of physiotherapy.     (b) A service engaged in the application of artificial limbs.     (c) A  department concerned  with the  functional  restoration of dis-          abled limbs, and the professional  re-education  of the wounded          soldier.     (d) Laboratories or shops engaged in   research work relating to arti-          ficial  limbs, and in the making  of these instruments.  When a soldier has lost a limb he is sent, as soon  as the stump is healed,to  the  orthopaedic centre, nearest to  the district  which he left to jointhe  army.  He  is submitted immediately  after  arrival to an examinationat  the hands of  the Chief  of the Service. The  ty7pe  of  apparatus herequires is  selected;  measurements, or  a  plaster model of  the  stump, orboth, are taken;  and the artificial limb is made, sometimes by the civilworkmen,  and sometimes  by the workmen in the shops at the  orthopaediccentre.  During the period  needed for the making of the apparatus the woundedman is not  idle.  He&apos;  has the  right  to  choose  one of  the followingopportunities:       1.  To remain at the  Orthopaedic  Centre, where he will take part in          the  training  for functional restoration and  professional  re-           edueation  which is a  part of  the routine  treatment at  the          Centre.     2.  To follow a course of a similar kind at any other centre.     3.  To return to his  ordinary work at his  own home,   or  under his           former master.  In  this case he is given a long pass open to
           renewal, and &quot;every help is given him to return free of cost           to the Orthopsedic Centre to obtain his artificial limb and  to           wear  it there until he is satisfied that it fits well and is  com-           fortable and efficient.   The time  taken for  the application  of a limb varies from two  weeks  to two  months, according to its complexity.  Every wounded man has the right to two limbs, so  that if one is broken,  he is not laid aside unable  to work.  If a man has lost his lower limb, for example, he is given, as well as the artificial  limb,   a  simple  substitute which will allow him to  con- tinue his  work while the  better type of limb is undergoing  any necessary repair or  alteration.  If a man has lost his upper  limb he may be given :       (a) An  arm with movable joints,  supplied with a hand, and an  arti-           ficial thumb  piece.  This limb is also supplied with a  number  of           alternative instruments to be put in place of the hand,  e.g.,           a hook or ring or clip, or any professional instrument, and     (&amp;) A working arm of a strong and simple type to which may quickly           be attached   one  of several instruments used  in daily  work.           (The best type  of this kind had a very simple ingenious catch           devised by Zander  of  Stockholm.)   If  a man has lost both arms  he has the  right to two  artificial  limbs, each  with a movable thumb.  This arrangement  therefore allows a  man soon  after his admission to an  Orthopsedic Centre to be given an apparatus of a  simple  type  by which he can walk, or with which he can  do certain forms of work.  His professional re-education therefore may begin at once. When a man has had  his artificial limb adjusted and is ready to return home, he  receives a little book  wherein is written everything necessary for him to know about the repair,  &amp;c, of the limb.  The  responsibility of the State to  mend  and  renew the limb lasts throughout  the  man&apos;s life.   The French problem  of prothesis&apos;is,  on the  whole,  an easier one than ours,  because  of  the large  proportion  (estimated at approximately  37-5 per cent.)  of the maimed men who return to  agricultural work.   For  this kind  of labour a very  simple  apparatus is all  that is necessary,  whether the limb  lost is  an arm or  a  leg.    Strength  rather than delicacy  is required.   So  far as the cases of loss of the lower limb are concerned, I think there can be no  doubt that the French methods and results are in some  respects better than our own.   A &quot;provisional&quot; artificial  limb is  applied, in  the case of the thigh or leg as earfy as eight or ten days after an amputation has been performed, often before the wound is healed, or the  flaps  brought into apposition.  In the apparatus of Professor Depage and Dr.  Martin, of Brussels,  or in that of Dr. Alquier, arrangements  are made for  the dressing of  the wound  without  the removal of the temporary artificial limb.  Crutches are not allowed in the case of any man who has lost only one lower limb. He is  expected to be able to  walk  as soon as the artificial limb  is adjusted.  If the  amputation  has been performed  near the hip- joint he is permitted to use a stick.  This custom  of the early application of a   provisional  limb   is due,  I  believe,  largely  to  the  advocacy of Professor   Depage.   It  has  many advantages.    The  changes in  an amputation  stump,  changes  of size, shape and textural looseness,  occur at first very quickly, and then for many months very slowly; it is there- fore  impossible in these early days to apply  a  limb that  will  be  per- manently   satisfactory.   The  definitive  apparatus, which  must fit per- fectly, can  only  be adjusted when  all  the  changes  of  contour  and dimensions in  the stump  are  as  nearly as  possible completed.    It is therefore necessary to apply a provisional apparatus which can  easily be altered to suit the changing proportions in the stump, an apparatus which is  strong, cheap, and capable  of being  fitted easily  to  one patient  after another during, their   period  of  waiting for  the  final  change  in  the stump.  This appli :ation of the provisional apparatus  should be made as early  as possible  so  that the period  of  helplessness  of the patient is shortened,  and atrophy of the muscles  of the stump prevented.  The apparatus  devised  by  Depage  and Alquier,  in their   efficiency,strength, cost, ease  of  adjustment, are so  much better  than any others-
that it  would be an advantage to have them adopted for the use of  ourwounded, and made in England.  The definitive  apparatus,  which in  thecase of the thigh was the best of all I saw, is that invented by Depage  andMartin.  It is made of wood shavings.  It fits the amputated stump withperfect  accuracy,  and gives,  therefore, a  sense of great  security.  It isstrong and yet light.  It has an  easily controlled movement at the knee,and it  allows slight lateral  movement at the  ankle a  point  of  greatimportance.  Finally,  it is very  cheap.  I am not able to give its cost,because it is made entirely by the artificers trained,  and at work, in theOrthopaedic Department of Dr.  Depage&apos;s hospital  at La Panne.  In the case of  the  upper extremity, I find  that  the opinions of bothdoctors  and  patients vary  very much as to the practical utility of  thecomplicated limbs, with movable  thumb and fingers,  of  which there  aretwo or  three good patterns.  The prothesis of the upper limb is not tobe compared in efficiency with that of the lower limb.  Much research workand great ingenuity will  have to be practised before a really simple  anduseful artificial hand can be produced.  No sufficient enquiry has yet been made in England, so far as I  know,into the exact  kind of amputation that  is  capable of giving  the mostuseful stump to which an  artificial hand can be applied.   The problem ofthe  training of  the divided  muscles so  that  use can  be made of  them inproducing  movements in  the artificial  hand  has  certainly  not  beenadequately studied.  The question  as to  the  best  point  at which a limb should be  removedhas generally been considered one for the decision of the surgeon  alone.But if  advance in the adjustment of  prothetic apparatus to  amputationstumps is  to be  made, it can only  result  from a  collaboration of  thesurgeons and the instrument  makers.  If to the surgeon it is  a matterof  indifference as to whether an  amputation is performed a little higheror  a little  lower in the limb,  the  prothetic aspect of the matter should beconsidered before the operation  is performed.    The  instrument  makershould  be asked to  state what operation,  from his  point of view,  wouldgive the stump  to which,  with most ease and most  prospect of  utility, alimb could be adjusted.  From the patient&apos;s point of view,  that amputa-tion is the best which will most fully allow the re-establishment of thefunction of the limb.  Prothesis,  therefore, should  be both purposeful and aesthetic, that  isto  say, should establish, so far as is  possible, the function  and  the formof  the amputated  member.    It should  be  commenced  at the earliestpossible moment; in many cases  before the healing of  the wound is com-plete.   This  will  lead in the case of the  lower limb  to  the abolition ofcrutches, which  are sometimes dangerous, and to the precocious use ofprovisional apparatus. . It will result in all-cases in a conservation  of thepower  of  divided muscles,  which will be given work to  do when  theapparatus  is worn.  Experience by degrees will show  the precise  operativemethod which,  in each individual, will give the stump easily capable ofhaving the most  efficient apparatus applied to it.  Consideration will, ofcourse, always be given to the work  in the  world which the man has todo.  There  is,  for example,  evidence  to show that the circular  (&quot;flush&quot;or  &quot; flapless &quot;)  method of amputation of  the arm,  which met with verydestructive criticism in the early days of the  war  from those ignorantof  the  conditions in  France which  made it the only operation capableof  saving life, may prove to  be a goofl method from the prothetic  stand-point.  The  cut  muscles reach the end of the stump  and may possibly beutilised to act. upon parts  of an artificial  arm placed  in deliberate contactwith them, and  so be made to control movements of the thumb and fingers.The prothesis in the  upper arm  and forearm  is so deplorably inefficientthat problems such  as this require the most careful  consideration by thebest brains available in this  country.   Dp to the present no good  resultseems anywhere to have resulted from trials  upon  these lines,  but  theproblem is  worth pursuing.  The present method of securing advice forthe Pensions Ministry on  questions  of prothesis is,  I  am  informed, asfollows:  -     (1) At  each of the hospitals for limbless soldiers the Surgical Staff          form a Committee to  examine,  try, and report upon any  new
          limb submitted to them.  The Committees are unofficial, and are          formed by  the surgeons, on their  own initiative, to further the          Work.    (2)  A  Central  Committee,  originally  constituted by  the War Office,          and taken  over by the Pensions Office,  sits  at regular intervals.          This Committee consists of Engineers and Surgeons with Rep) e-          sentatives of the  Pensions Ministry and War Office.  Each limb-          less hospital sends representatives, or a  representative,  to this          Committee.  This Committee has examined the limbs supplied          by the various hospitals and has  drawn  up a list of the types          of which it approves.  No limb may now  be ordered until it lias          been approved by the Committee, except one example  of a new          type for experimental purposes.   These are reported  on to the          Central Committee,  which considers the report, examines the          limb, and either adds it to the list of limbs approved or rejects it.  The Committee forms a centre at which the staffs of the various limblesshospitals meet and discuss their work and see each other&apos;s apparatus.  The Committee has also examined and standardised  certain appliances tobe used with artificial limbs.  No appliances may be  ordered except thosewhich are on the authorised list.  The  decisions reached  by the  Roehampton Committee are mainly oflocal interest.  It  is  true  that more  than  three-fourths of the patientssupplied with artificial limbs are sent to Roehampton. But the  principlesguiding  the  surgeons there, and their  methods, are not made easily andwidely available  for  general use.  A small booklet was published  by theWar Office summarising the results of  the exjierience of the Roehamptonstaff, and giving guidance to surgeons as to the best sites for amputations.In this little work,  however, some statements are perhaps open to questionor revision and further investigation is necessary before valid conclusionscan be established.   I beg therefore to  make the following suggestions:      (1)  A  small Committee should  be  appointed  to  consider afresh and          report upon, certain formulated questions,  for example: What          are the amputations that ought to be practised in any part of          the upper  or lower extremities  having regard to:               (a) The  most complete restoration or function that is possible                  for the  several trades to  which  the  maimed  soldier                  may return.             (b) The  nearest possible restoration of form.             What  are the best  forms of  a provisional and  definitive          apparatus  for  the several  amputations  practised  in  different          portions of the upper and lower extremities in  respect of:      -.,&apos;       (a) Early adjustment.             (b) Efficiency.             (c) Ease  of adjustment  to several patients in succession.             (d) Material.             (,e) Cost.    (2)  A General Institution, research laboratory and hostel in one, should          be established in which a number of men,  50 to 100, who  have     i-     lost one or both arms,  could be trained  to different sorts of          work: with different types of artificial arms.             Experience, would  then help  to enlighten  and perhaps  to:&apos;!      :  - solve many of the extremely  difficult and unsettled  questions :r    .  ;  involved in the prothesis of the upper extremity.    (3) Steps shovdd be taken  to encourage the early application of pro-          visional  apparatus to all cases  of amputation  of  the thigh or          leg.  Under existing arrangements a man who  has lost his leg           is kept  in hospital  until his  wound is  healed, then  awaits           admission  to Roehampton, and  after a delay of varying length           is fitted with an  artificial limb.   Meanwhile;he is walking on
          crutches and is idle.   It  would be a great advantage to apply          provisional artificial limbs to such patients so that they might          be walking  in two or three  weeks.  Re-education might  then          be started and the many weeks or months of inactivity,, with its          resultant moral ill-effects, be prevented.    (4)  The Ministry of  Pensions should be constantly advised either by          a small Committee (such as suggested under (1)) or by a surgeon          of experience  in  orthopsedic and prothetic matters.  Probably          after the Committee has reported, one  of its  members might be          appointed surgical adviser to the Ministry of Pensions, his  duty          being to keep  abreast of all new  developments in prothesis, and          to advise in all general questions of amputations and appliances.    (5)  The multiplication of establishments, like  that at Roehampton, in          connection  with  the  larger Orthopsedic Departments  in this          country would be a great  advantage.   As a  result,  the more          rapid  application of both provisional  and  definitive  apparatus          to amputated  limbs would be  possible,  and  a&quot;comparison  of          results in the different centres might make for general advanee-          ment in matters of prpthesis.  These suggestions are not intended  to  underestimate the  value  of thevery important  work  already done by  the Committee of  Surgeons atRoehampton and the Central Committee,  but to  indicate the need, for  amore thorough organisation of the same kind with duties officially defined,for an  increase in the scope of such  work, and for greater diffusion of theknowledge reached.        (2)  PHYSICAL  RE-EDUCATION  OK TREATMENT. SECTION  I.            REPORT BY CAPT.  J.  CAMPBELL MCCLUBE, C.A.M.C.  The following is a short resume of the work of Section I,  at  the Con-ference, which has to do with the physical treatment and functional restora-tion of the disabled soldier.   Fourteen resolutions were passed as the resultof the work  of  the Section,*  and I give certain notes  both on the work ofthat Section and on the question of re-education in general from the medicalpoint of  view.  These conclusions were not arrived at without some discussion.   It was.interesting to find that in France and in Belgium, as in this.country, thosewho were devoting themselves to  physical treatment were still under  thenecessity of  urging the surgeon to send his cases for such treatment  earlierthan has been his habit in order to obtain the best possible  results  in  theway of cure.  This point cannot be over-emphasised.   Many cases are sentto special hospitals Jand clinics to be treated far too late in the course oftheir disablement, and there  is  no doubt that many  valuable months  arespent on the treatment of cases who  have been kept in  general  hands  toolong.  There was a distinct desire  on  the part of the Belgian section of the Con-gress to impress the methods in use in  Sweden on  all  those who. practisedphysical treatment.  The British and the French delegates objected to this,especially on the point that  all  apparatus for mechanotherapy should bestrictly according to Zander models.  The British and the French delegatespointed out  that in our various countries other apparatus; had already beenfound to be  of  service that differed very greatly from Zander models, andit was especially emphasised that all apparatus for  mechanotherapy  shouldbe so used that  the movements were active and not passive.  This point wascarried at the  instigation of the French and British delegates by a largemajority.  But the delegates were all agreed, very strongly so, on  the neces-sity of having all physical training and  treatment under strict medicalSee Resolutions 1-14 in Appendix II. (I).
supervision until such time as the patient is ready to be sent back to theArmy in some capacity or another, or, if judged unfit for military service,is  ready to begin re-education of a  purely professional  kind.  It was held both by the British and French  delegates that  functionalrestoration by work should be considered only as a part of the physical treat-ment, and should not be in any way re-educative in a professional sense;that is to say, that as soon, as a man is found to be unfit for military servicehe should not continue his professional re-education in the hospital or com-mand  depot   where  curative work   is  being  employed,  but  should   beimmediately  drafted  to another centre.    The  reason for this is obvious.When  workshops are definitely connected  with  hospitals and  a portion  ofthese  workshops  is devoted to professional re-education, there is  a greatdanger of two things.  Firstly, an enthusiastic medical officer in charge ofthe workshops is apt  to become too keen on what is, after  all,  a side-line,and men develop  in the direction of professional re-education instead  ofbeing stopped short either when their curative  work has made them fit toreturn to the Army, or when they have shown themselves to be quite unfitfor further service.  Secondly, the mingling of these two  classes  is bound tocause dissatisfaction among those who return to the Army.  This is natural,and is a problem which has to be faced very seriously.  The  visit to Port Villez was to me very interesting, because I discoveredamong  the patients who  were being re-educated  for professional work  alarge  number who could have been, by further treatment, carried on muchfurther towards a cure, or perhaps could have been completely cured, so asto be able to take their place in the Army again in some capacity or another.This is  a great argument in favour of  the question which  we of  the WarDisablement  Committee of the Section of Balneology and Climatology of theRoyal  Society of Medicine have  urged  since January,  1915, namely,  thatone of the most  important things is to see that disabled men are treatedearly  by physical means, and that this treatment should be carried on per-sistently and intelligently under trained supervision, so that as  few men aspossible may require  re-education.  This does not apply, of course, to menwho have lost a limb, but it applies  to men who  by reason of  stiff joints,shell-shock, neurasthenia and the like are equally incapacitated from takingup useful work as a man who has sustained amputation.   Another point which struck me forcibly was that the  success  of  anydepartment which I saw  and the success of any work done depended  notonly upon the equipment of the place, so long as that were merely adequate,but upon the ability, concentration and sympathy of the officers and com-mittees in charge.  In other words, as Sir John Collie has so often pointedout, the man behind  the gun still remains one of the largest factors in thesuccess of any scheme of treatment or re-education.  We must  have know-ledgable men with an insight into the maimed persons who are under theircare.   The last point which I would emphasise is also a  practical  one, and  oneabout which  there is  bound to be a  great  deal of  important and necessarydiscussion in this country.  A doubt exists as to who will  take charge of andbe responsible for the preliminary professional re-education of the disabledman between the time he leaves hospital and the time he is able to attend atechnical school of some kind, whether mechanical,  commercial or agricul-tural.  During this intermediate period the patient demands medical super-vision.  If a patient is discharged from hospital or command depot as unfitcor military  service he becomes at once a civilian, and is no longer amenableto any discipline whatever.  All must be done by persuasion.   It seems tome that it would be wise in this intermediate stage to have the man stillunder military  discipline as well as medical supervision, so that he wouldstill remain  a soldier after leaving  the hospital during  his period of pre-liminary professional training until he enters a technical institution proper.   The purely military personnel necessary for the controlling of such inter-mediate re-educational schools would not be great.  A retired  major orlieutenant-colonel, with perhaps one qther junior officer unfit  for service,
226   together with a few non-commissioned officers, also discharged and  unfit for   further service,  would control, as far as military discipline goes,  a fairly   large institution.  Medical supervision could easily he obtained by the part-   time service of medical men in the vicinity of the  institution, and by a   regular medical visitor having a special knowledge of these conditions, who   would  supervise from time  to time the  conduct  and progress   of  the   institution.     It seems to me that on  the proper settlement of this point depends very   largely the success  of  the whole  scheme  of re-education in Great Britain.   We have already the experience  of the beginning of work under  military   discipline  before patients leave Roehampton to show us what an advantage   this is  in the after re-education of the man.  If a man is suddenly allowed   to disappear  from  military control before he has undergone his period  of   preliminary re-education, combined with medical treatment, he will speedily   begin to drift, and it will be difficult to collect him again, so that thousands   of otherwise  useful men&apos; would certainly be lost  to  the  country at  a time1   when  production will be of the, greatest  importance. I  think it is  unwise   to listen to those who say that  the thing  cannot be done, and it appears to   ine that the objections urged are due to the somewhat bureaucratic rigidity   which  naturally obtains  in  large Government  departments  which have   existed for a long rime.                                                  J.  CAMPBELL MCCLTJRE.           (3) PROFESSIONAL  RE-EDITCATION  OR  TRAINING SECTION II.                      REPORT BY  FLEET-SURGEON BOYDEN.      This section was presided over by Dr. Bourillon,  Director of the School   for the Disabled at Saint Maurice.      M.  Leon de Paeuw  (Belgium), the General  Secretary of the Conference.   presented an analysis of 15 reports on the choice of a trade or occupation   for the crippled, all of which reports laid stress  on  the importance of this   question.      Dr.  Sand  (Belgium), in a very complete study of professional  re-educa-   tion,  said that  men  the  victims of industrial  accidents usually showed a   feeble power of re-adaptation, but that the  contrary was true for those   crippled by  warfare.      The conclusions he had come to were  that:         (1) The  loss of a  lower limb interfered with a  man&apos;s getting a liveli-             hood in  only a small number  of trades, and that the loss of an             arm also allowed the men to take up remunerative work in many             cases so long as he was scientifically and  individually trained.       (2) It is more  logical, easier and  more economical to endeavour to             place the man  in the trade he worked at previous to his injury.       (3) Each case should be individually studied before a choice of  occu-             pation is made.   The doctor in charge  of  the case should  be             the sole  arbiter of  the patienfs destiny as to  his future  work             after a complete study of his disability,  calling in specialists in             neurology,  ophthalmology, &amp;c, to aid  him  in  his  decision, if             necessity arises.   But in taking.stock of the economic  position             of the  invalid as regards the different trades he is capable of             entering  the advice of the technician should  in all  cases be             obtained.   Crowded  trades or  those  of an  unstable   or  non-             remunerative  kind  should be  avoided.   The  kind  of trades             pursued in the man&apos;s native place  should be  taken note of.      In   this connection it  may be  of interest  to say  that I  visited  two    establishments  in  Paris  where outside  trades  are taught, but  in which    there  is a great demand for  workmen  at  the present time owing to the    fact that before the war Germans were largely employed in them.      (1) Government  School in  Rue Puits de 1&apos;Ermite,  with 200  students.    In this school, in  addition to  the  teaching of book-keeping, photography,       11999                                            &apos;           A5II
ifcc, a considerable number  of  men are taught the  business of a furrier,which  includes-the preparation of  the  raw skins as well as the cuttingof furs and making them into garments.  For the first part a two to  threemonths&apos; course is given and for the  second the com-.se averages six months.The work done appeared to  be of a high-class order, and I  was informedthat very good wages were obtained by  the  men.  The  school has been inexistence about two years.  (2) A  school at !). Rue de  1&apos;Eperon, where 25 men  are  taught glass-blowing.   All  articles  made   were used  either in  laboratories or  bychemists.   They comprised ampoules, pipettes, phials.  &amp;c,  and were  allsent to the Central  Government Laboratory  at Val  de Grace for issue tothe Army.   The course lasts  three months and a  good  man can make400-500  ampoules  per&apos; day.    The   average  wage  earned  amounted  to3-10 francs a month.   All men  employed in  this  establishment  had lost alower limb.  Dr.  Dam (Belgium)  divides  the re-education  of the  cripple  into three?stages: (a)   Physical;  (b)   Functional:  (e) Professional   (properlyspeaking).  Tho  social and personal value of  the  maimed   is of the highest iniport-ancc.  If he was formerly a workman he should remain so; the intellectualcan nearly always resume his former occupation.  In choosing an occupation the doctor  should examine the man (1)  fromthe psychological side,  (2) from the  anatomical and physiological side.  For  amputated&quot; men the condition of the stump should be  minutelystudied under working conditions, taking into consideration the elementof fatigue.  He considers that the choice of a profession and  re-adaptationto working life are exclusively  medical problems.  In the course of the  discussion which followed these reports this lastopinion was combated  by several speakers who considered that doctorshad  not, generally  speaking,  sufficient technical  knowledge  to  justifytheir advising men as to the  trades they should enter and that they oughtto confine themselves to the functional  re-education of the maimed.  Dr.  Lebriin (Belgium)  thought that the task  of choosing a  professionshould be confided to a  council, of which he did  not  mention the composi-tion, but defines its role as follows:      (1) To determine the necessity  lor  and the  nature  of  the treatment          to be followed.    (2) The  possibility  of  the  niaifs  continuing  his  old&quot;  trade  or the          eventual adoption  of a new one.    (3) His intellectual capacity.  Concerning the choice; of occupation Dr. Lebrun groups the men in fourcategories:      (I) Those who after the  war  will  lie  able  to  resume  their  former          occupations.    (2) Those who are incapable of taking up their former trades.  These          men should  be allowed, as far as possible, the choice of a new          occupation, without  exercising any pressure  on them to enter          a  workshop  where  for  the  moment work  abounds  or  the          remuneration  is great.            Medical and social considerations should be the main factor,          and the trade chosen ought to be in consonance with the man&apos;s          physiotberapeutieal treatment.  Enquiry  should lie made as to          his domicile, his social status, his resources, tastes, etc., and the          reasons which urge him to choose the trade in question; and in          this connection it  must be borne  in mind that he will speedily          abandon a trade into which he has been urged to enter more or          less against his will.    (3) Those whose financial  condition  is such  that  no trade  is of use           to them.  For these  men professional (manual)  work will  be          prescribed by  the  doctor solely with the view  of physiotherapy,          and he  will  choose  a suitable  workshop where it can  be carried          out.
     (4)  Complete invalids who cannot  be re-educated.  These latter will           have to he supported  by the State and every effort  should  be           made to ameliorate their condition.   Dr. Lejeune (Belgium),  formerly  Director of  the Belgian  establish- ment  at Port  Villez,  considers  that doctors should exercise a  prepon- derating,  though  not an  exclusive, influence in  the re-education  of the maimed.  At Port Villez  doctors were in the first place in sole  charge  of invalids in regard to their selection for a trade,  but at  the  present time this  is  carried out  by a body  composed of the  Medical Director, the Director of  Studies,  the Technical  Director,  and  the doctor  in  charge  of the laboratory where researches are  made as to handiwork and orthopaedics.   The wounded man before ho comes before  this  body makes a round  of the different workships in order  to fix his inclination, if possible.  When ho comes before the  Council he is interrogated as to his previous employ- riient, his  social status, his  degree  of intelligence  and general knowledge, and his  aptitude  for work.  The anatomical condition of his  injured limb is  minutely  examined and his physiological and functional state enquired into.  The principles guiding the Council are as follows:       (a)  The  man  returns  to his  former occupation if it is to his liking,           if  it is sufficiently  remunerative,  and  if  the  injury does not           lead to  a large  reduction  in output.     (h)  If the man  is obliged  to change his occupation  he  is advised  to           take up one similar  but less  fatiguing and less  difficult.   It           may be considered that those  having lost an arm and fitted with           a  &quot; working &quot; apparatus will have their output reduced  2o per           cent, as compared with a normal workman.   In  cases where  it  is  doubtful  what work  a cripple is  able to take up he should  be kept  under the observation of an  instructor  in the work- shop and also of his  doctor until  such time  as a definite opinion as to his capabilities can he pronounced.   Dr.  Nyns  (Belgium) was of  the  opinion  that the  deformity  itself does not give absolute  indication as to  choice of trade, although it is the chief one.   He has noted that men  with similar  lesions differed  largely with  regard  to the aptitude they  displayed during their  apprenticeship.   One-armed  men  were the most  difficult to  re-educate and should  there- fore be  advised to take up  work necessitating the use of one arm  only. or  work  of a non-manual  character.   Those  with  various  lesions  of the  upper  limb short  of   amputation require careful selection for their new employment.   With regard to  men having lost a lower limb it is a mistake to suppose they cannot take  up  a trade necessitating their standing up.  Men with  head  injuries should not enter trades where there  might  be danger of accident through giddiness or where the posture is of  a  nature to  aggravate the  lesion.  M.  Jouve (France) found  that  in his  school at Montrouge only a small percentage of the maimed take up their former  work or even  one akin to  it,  Much depends  upon the  will-power  of the  man  in   overcoming difficulties  as well as on his inherent dexterity.   He  has  never yet had to  call for  medjeal  advice as to whether a  man should or  should notcontinue  in his new  occupation.  In the  future he considers  that owingto shortage  of labour electrical power will come  more to the  front, and advises men  to take  up this form of  mechanical work if  they are fit for it,  and further it would be extremely useful for  those working  at theirhomes  in making  toys,  parts of clocks,  &amp;c,  employing an electric motorfor the purpose.  Dr. Pierrot (France) thought that  men should  not be  placed  in largefactories  as labourers where  they  would  certainly gain a  wage, but wouldnever  advance,  and  would  compete  with  valid  men  to their  mutualdetriment.  On the contrary a trade  should be chosen where  competitionis less and where  the men would be  more  independent.  Labour savingmachinery  has rendered the livelihood of mechanics  precarious,  but hascreated the  &quot; repairer &quot; who can be  well employed mending  clocks andwatches,  agricultural implements, boots and  clothes, &amp;c.    11999                                                         A 6
  Dr.  Curie  (France) said that on  account of the large number of themaimed  entering schools  of  instruction there  is  a  marked  tendency  toclassify them by  &quot; slips &quot;  according  to  their injury and  to dispense withthe careful examination  by doctors and  technicians, which  he considersindispensable to the man&apos;s future welfare.  M.  Alleman  (Belgium),  who is director of studies  at  Port  Villez, gavethe indispensable factors in the choice of a  profession under the followingheadings:    A. Physical  Aptitude. A  searching  medical  examination  should   bemade in  order to exclude the candidate  from work requiring certain nmve-ments  or efforts  which  are incompatible  with his disability.    It thusfollows that tho doctor should be au fait with  the  movements required  ineach industry.  B. Predilection. Compulsion  should  never be. employed.    In  certainschools 80  per  cent,  of failures  have occurred  through  misconception  ofthis principle.    Those of  apathetic  nature  should  bo stimulated  byexample  and  persuasion  on the  part of both instructors  and  advancedpupils demonstrating to  them  what  can  be  done  by  application  andpatience.  C. Habitual  Residence. Agricultural,  workers  should take  up  theirprevious occupation;  rural artisans should  remain in their  villages andtown  dwellers in  their towns.  1).  Previous  Occupation. Use  should be made  of experience  gainedby  men  in their  previous employment in  directing  them  to take  upoccupations of a  similar nature  using  the  same raw materials of whichthey have some knowledge.  A fitter  or mechanic could become a designer,a mason or carpenter an inspector of work, etc.  E. Intellectual Capacity. Certain  trades  require intellectual capacity.and thus men in  this category  who have  lost an  arm  could be usefullyemployed  in   intellectual  occupations,   eg.,   bookkeepers,  managers.teachers, &amp;c, the  author  only having limited  confidence in the efficiencyof artificial apparatus in  place of a hand.  During the discussion a statement was made that  in  Bordeaux  a  largenumber  of the maimed took up  commercial pursuits  with marked  success.Another speaker said it would be a good  plan to  establish schools solelyfor men  who had lost an  arm.  F. Moral  qualities. Will  power, tenacity   and  patience  should   be,steadily  cultivated, and the feeble who before the war had  tried severaltrades should not  be put into occupations requiring long and sustainedeffort.-  G. Financial  state. Certain  trades   require  the  possession of  somecapital,  and unless funds can lie  obtained from charitable societies  menshould  not enter  them, though efforts should  be  made to  prevent  menfalling in  social status.  M.  Baseque (France)  expressed  similar  opinions  to  othor  authoritiesas regards the necessity for collaboration between doctors, educationalists.technicians and  orthopaedic  specialists in  advising  the  maimed as  tochoice of  occupation.  He was  strongly  against  employment  of  cripplesin  big industries.   Dr.  Leullier  (France)  considered  that the  choice  of  profession oughtnot to be left to  the fancy of  the injured man,  but the doctor shouldgive  him  all  information  possible as to his disabilities  and the  kind  ofwork he was  fit  to take up.   If  he  talked  freely to  the man it was rarethat  lie did not consent to take up the occupation most  suitable to hiscapacity.   Madame Barthez  said  that  throe considerations  should guide one  inthe choice of a profession:       (a)  The capacity for  work of the cripple;     (h)  His  aptitude and preferences;     (r)  The  needs of the  district he lived in.
  Her  views  for  the  most part  coincided with  those  expressed  by otherwriters.  She thought that directors of schools  should communicate  withthe mayors of  small  places  throughout  the country  and find out  fromthem  the trades  carried  on in  their  villages  in order  to facilitate re-cmployment of the  maimed in  their  native places.  Mile.  Meyer  (France)   considered  that  a  preliminary  stage  lastingperhaps  as long  as two to three months was necessary to guide  a  manin the  choice of  his  new  profession  before proceeding to re-educationproper.  Dr.&quot;  Dijonneau  (Franco)  was  of  the  opinion  that  constant  medicalsupervision of men working in  the  schools and shops is  a necessity, asit is only by doing  so that  a maximum  output will be reached withoutunduly fatiguing the  men.   Captain  Haccour  defines  the aim of  pro-fcssional re-education  as  follows:  &quot;To  provide disabled soldiers  withnew  means of  gaining a  livelihood  in civil life  in  place  of  those  theyhave lost by  reason  of their injuries.&quot;  This authority was  also in favour of  giving  the  men free  choice  of acalling;  and, to  make  this a practical proposition,  he thinks  that everyschool  should provide  instruction in  as many trades as  possible.  In the discussion which followed, a Belgian speaker said he was stronglyin favour of  convalescent hospitals and workshops being in juxtaposition.  M.  de Paeuw (Belgium), who was in full agreement  with others  as toiho necessity of  bringing  disabled men before  a council  composed  of adoctor, an  educationalist  and  a technician, after analysing the views ofthe foregoing writers  drew the  following  conclusions:      1.  The  interest  of the man should be  the chief  concern  of  the          council.    2.  He  should, if  possible, be  re-educated in his  old  occupation unless         .his professional capacity had been reduced by his  wounds to          below 80 per cent, or  the work was  not  sufficiently renumera-          tive, or harmful to his  physical or moral state, or that the man          felt  himself rightly  or  wrongly incapable  of exercising  it          again.    3.  If he  is obliged to change his  trade, there is  much advantage in          placing him  in another of a similar nature but  less tiring, in          order that his  previous knowledge of his craft,  which  will be          invaluable, shall not  be lost  to him.            Men who have  previously been engaged  in farming  should,          if  their injuries prevent them resuming  this branch of  agri-          culture, take up market gardening, butter  and cheese-making,          poultry raising, or learn to repair and drive motor tractors.          Owing  to  the tendency of  the rural  population to  seek  work          in  towns,  it is  of  prime  importance  that   men  should  be          persuaded to work on  the land.    4.  Disabled  men  should  be encouraged  to become artisans and  work          in  their own  homes,  being  aided  by  apparatus  driven  by         electricity.      &quot;    5.  If the man has lost an arm, an  artificial  limb should not be forced          upon him,  but  it  should only be supplied to  those  who desire          it for the purpose  of continuing the occupation they  had before         the war.  M.  de Paeuw  noted that the  marked  inclination of  men  to try forsoft jobs should be strongly combated  by pointing out  that the numberof such posts is  strictly limited,  and  that  they would be  much happierand more independent in  learning  a  trade which would  bring them  ina decent wage.  Also he gives a warning concerning a class of apatheticindividuals who  accept the first job  they are offered  with  the intentionof leaving  it  at the  earliest  opportunity.  The  ad visory  council, the constitution of which has already been  given.will assume all responsibility as to  the man&apos;s choice of occupation,  andonce he has made his choice  he will go to the  workshops on a  fortnights
trial.  If at  the end of that period it  is found that ho is  unable to makeany  progress  lie  is  brought before the council  again, who will  do  theirbest  to place him  in  some other  kind of work.  These councils, which would have to supply several  establishments, willcommence  by eliminating     (1) All  those  who by  reason  of   their injury  have no  need of  re-          education,  or  who  with a  little  re-adaptation, can  carry  on          their  trade;    (2) All  those  belonging to  big public or private enterprises  where          their  employers  consent to take  them  back   voluntarily  or          according to law.  The  groups which remain  will be dealt  witli as shown in the  foregoingremarks, each one.on its own .merits.                                             P.  H.

SECTION  II.REPORT UV LIEUTENANT-COLONEL K.  A. STAMTON AND MAJOK It.  MITCHELL.Sin,      IN accordance with your  instructions, we have the honour to  reportthat we attended  the  Meetings oi  the Second  Section of the Allied Con-leience held  in the  Grand  Palais,  Paris, on  Tuesday, Wednesday,  andThursday, the 8th, 9th, and 10th instant, respectively.  At  the  opening Meeting  of  the  Section,  which  was  presided over byDr.  Bourrillon,  a  limited  number  of  printed reports,   insufficient tosupply half the members present, were produced, containing papers by thefollowing :                          M.  de  Paeuw.                        M.  Allman,                        Surgeon-Major Ripert.                        Madame David Weill,                        Dr. Pierre Xegnier.    These various papers were read  by their authors and a discussion, oftensomewhat lively, ensued at the  conclusion of each in  connection with thevarious recommendations  put forward.  As we were not able to obtain acopy of the reports until  the morning of the 10th.  it was often somewhatdifficult to follow  the various  arguments  put forward.  No mention  wasmade of the paper prepared by Major Mitchell, but a  promise  was givenby the President  of  the  Section that if  an  opportunity presented itselfthe paper should be  discussed  and  read.  This opportunity was given atthe close of  the Session oil Thursday  morning, when extracts of the mostimportant part of  the paper  were duly read and received with considerableapplause.  On  Tuesday morning, May 8th, a  somewhat lively and lengthy discussiontook  place as  to  whether the  Military- Doctors or Training  Instructorsshould be in  chief charge  of the discharged men.   It was  pointed  out byus that there seemed  to  be no consideration  taken for the man himselfin the discussion, and that it was very necessary that the man&apos;s own wishesas regards his training should be taken into account.  These remarks werewell  received, and it  was finally agreed  that treatment should be  com-menced in hospital under  medical supervision, and it was pointed out fromexperience that whereas only 5 per cent, of those who commenced trainingin hospitals eventually failed to continue, there were,  on the other hand.some  80 per cent,  lost who took no  training at all.  if the epiestion of theirtraining was left until the men were finally  discharged.
                                   n  Answers  were obtained to the following question  which we asked  is it compulsory for a soldier to remain  under military discipline underthe following conditions:      Q. 1. Until perfectly cured?    A. In  France Yes.       Ill  Italy Up to six months or longer, and  if considered  necessary.              ii]) to one year.       ,Iu  Belgium Yes, but this  has only just been recently decided.    Q. 2. Until he has gone through a course of training?    A. In  France Yes.       In  Italy For six months only.       In  Belgium Yes.    Q. 3. &quot;What is  the period of training in a  Military  Training  Estab-              lishment ?    .1. In  France Variable.       In  Italy Variable.       In  Belgium Not limited.    Q. -I. What is  the period of training in a  Civil Training  Establish-              ment?    A. In  France Variable.       In  Italy Variable.       In  Belgium There are no Civil  Training Centres available,  and              Belgium has to retain all disabled soldiers at  present  until              the recovery of their country.  It was ascertained from various  French officers that the system in voguein France  is for a disabled soldier to be sent to the Military  Hospital andTraining Centre in the  recruiting area  (Region)  of the Army  Corps towhich he  belongs.   At  this Centre he is medically treated for his  dis-ability and he is supplied with artificial  limbs, if  necessary.  During theperiod of his retention in one of these Military Centres, he is taught a trade,if so  desired,  but stress was laid on the fact that G5 per cent, of the menwere  originally agriculturists and,  in the opinion  of the French Govern-nient, it was deemed very necessary that as many  men should be returnedto the land as possible,  consequently, encouragement is not given to menwho have  been agriculturists to take  up  training  in other trades unlesstheir injuries  are such  as to prevent their return  to  the land.  It.  waspointed out that a  man  with an  amputated arm would  be fitted with anartificial limb, which enabled him to do  90 per cent,  of an able-bodiednian&apos;s agricultural  work.  The greater part of the implements which  havebeen  designed  and adopted in the  various Military Centres are  for  agri-cultural  pursuits, and there is no doubt that they are being produced in aconsiderably cheaper form than is being  done in  England,  but whetherthese  implements are of  an equally lasting nature  as those.of Britishmanufacture,  remains to be  seen.   Various attachments for use  with fieldtools  have  been manufactured, and are  obtainable  at a  cost not  exceeding50 francs each.  On the completion of  his period of treatment in a Military Centre, thedisabled  soldier is discharged and  placed on  the  pension list, and receiveshis Government  pension  through  the Ministry  of the  Interior.  Up tothe date of his discharge, he receives his pay from the Ministry of War.The pensions  of  discharged  soldiers are paid by the Prefects in each ofthe various Prefectures of the  country.   The Prefecture  also is in touchwith employers of labour; and if a man has not already found employment,they  direct him  to  the  various employers of labour in  the area of theiradministration, but  uo  arrangement whatsoever  is made  as  regards theman&apos;s wages or his  qualifications for the  employment to which he is sent,and some dissatisfaction is beginning to become manifest.  There  are, in addition, in  various large centres throughout the country.civil  societies,  known  as  &quot; Mutuel  Mutiles.&quot;   These  societies   assistdisabled  men  in the neighbourhood of their  activities from civil funds oftheir own raising, but there does not appear  to be any sort of co-operationbetween  the  &quot; Mutuels  Mutiles &quot;  throughout the country nor is  thereany State  recognition of the work carried out by them.  They, however,
would appear to have worked on similar  lines to the Soldiers1 and SailorsHelp  Society as  far as  the  men  themselves  are  concerned,  and  little ornothing appears to have been done for the families of men at the frontor for their widows and  dependants when they are killed or injured.  Visits were undertaken to  various institutions:  the Military Hospital atSt. Maurice was visited on Friday morning and is typical of other similarinstitutions throughout  France.    There  were  some  115 disabled  mentraining in the  workshops tit the hospital  at the  time  of  our visit.   Thefollowing  trades were being  taught:              Carpentry,          Leather work,            Basket making.     . Boot  making.            Tinsmith work,      Drawing  and surveying.            Bookkeeping,  lOaeh  disabled  man  requiring  it.  is,  on discharge,  supplied  with  anartificial limb,  and an  apparatus for  fastening on to  his  arm or leg toenable him to  use tools required  for  his  trade  or employment.   If  anyone of these gets broken  or out  of repair,  it can be sent  back to thecentre from which  the soldier received it free of cost, while a temporaryappliance is issued during the repairing  of the soldier&apos;s  regular one.  A visit  was also paid  to the Military Hospital and Training Institutionat Maison Blanche, some  1.5 miles to  the  north  of Paris, where  similartraining,  etc.. is  carried out  to that at St. Maurice, but where sonic 350men were employed.  At this  latter  establishment there are in  addition to the hospital wards,eighteen workshops erected  in  brick tiles  with hard  wood  floors,  whichstruck us as being  peculiarly well adapted  for the purpose for which theywore  erected.   They appear light,  airy,  strong  and yet of inexpensiveconstruction.  The  period  of  training  in these shops was stated  to  lie from  two tothree  months: consequently there  was no  work of  a very  finished characteras a  result of their short course of training,  ami  the authorities  relied onthe men completing their  courses of instruction  after  discharge from thoinstitution.  We  consider  that  there is  danger  to the men in  this ar-rangement, and certainly  in the  United Kingdom  we would  advocate  alonger period of training in  most  of the occupations taught.  The third institution visited was the &quot; Etablissemeiit pour Jes Aveugles &quot;or Blind Hostel  in the  Hue  Pen illy.  This  establishment, which takes theplace  in Paris of St.  Dunstan&apos;s in London, is a large  convent with a biggarden  and  is  eminently suited for  the  education  and treatment ofsoldiers blinded  in the  war.   Having been  rather  led to suppose that theFrench  were somewhat  behind England in  the treatment of their blindedsoldiers. I was  very  agreeably surprised to  find that this was not alto-gether the case,  as the  institution for  the blind  in Hue  Reuilty,  althoughnot, perhaps, so comfortable as St.  Dunstan&apos;s, proved  to us that the menwere  particularly  well  looked after  and  that   everything  is  done  toinstruct  them in  some   remunerative trade on which they can in futuredepend  for a livelihood, though  there was not the same  individual careof cases  that  is  the  marked  feature of St. Dunstan&apos;s.   The  groundsat the  institution in  question were  well  adapted  for  the purpose  andthe men were sitting about  in  the shade and enjoying  the  fine  weather.The  following trades were taught  and the men  seemed  to  be contentedand happy:                                Boot making,                              Basket  making.                              Brush making,                              Cooperage.in addition to Braile reading and  typing.  As  regards these particular trades,  it was ascertained that when theman is  discharged to his home he is supplied not  only with the necessarytools, but also with raw materials, and  the  produce of his work is soldfor him at the  central  office, if  he  has  any difficulty  of  disposing of itlocally.
  In  addition  a new installation lias  just  been  made  of large emerywheels with dynamo attachment to enable the blind to grind and polishn-lass  stoppers  for  bottles,  sent from  the manufacturers  in  the rough.In this latter  branch we were assured that it was  possible for a blindman to earn as much as six to eight  francs a day  for continuous workwhich was of the simplest nature.  Another  institution  that  we visited  was that of the Hospital of SaintLouis, in the Hue de Saint Petersburg, in Paris.  Dr.  Paul de Champtassinwas very anxious  that we should  see his method of treating orthopaediccases  in the Hospital of  St. Louis.  He has invented  a  machine which canbe set to move  any limb or portion of the  human body in  any regularmotion  or  direction required.   The speed  of the  movements can also beregulated from  invisible slowness to the quickest movement required forcither  an arm, hand  or leg.  We were very  much impressed  with  thesimplicity of the machine, of which there were five working in one wardwith  only  one  attendant  in charge.   The  patients  daily  go through acourse of&quot; half an hour.of these mechanical  movements under the directionof the man in  charge who  receives his orders  from  Dr.  Champtassin bymeans of  a  chart  giving  the exact instructions  for the  setting of  themachines before application  to  the patient.  If a man is discharged by the Medical Authorities- as totally incurable,and his pension is consequently assessed  at  a  high rate, it might be inthe interests of the Pensions Ministry  to  ascertain  whether Dr. Champ-tassin&apos;s  treatment  could not  be  applied.    We  understood  that   thismedical gentleman is  prepared  to offer to the British Government  oneof his machines free  of cost, and to  undertake to instruct a  class ofqualified medical attendants in the carrying out of his cure.  He informedus that the  cost of his  machines  before the war was  5,000 francs each,which included the dynamo and all  accessories.  The Orthopaedic Hospital at Grignou, near St. Cyr, was  visited.   Thishospital is situated in the grounds of the Agricultural College.  The visitorswere disappointed at the absence of any manual  instruction being imparted.The curative apparatus was of a varied character, but  as to the efficiency ofthe same we have  left the medical  delegates to  report.  The galleries  of two of the large salons of the Grand Palais were occupiedwith an.excellent collection of diagrams, photographs, models and specimensof artificial  limbs.  Many ingenious devices were  on view.   The firms  andschools represented were either Belgian or French.   Doubtless it was inconsequence of the absence of information in this country that Great Britainwas not represented.  It was fortunate that at the meeting of the delegates held at the PensionsMinistry on April 26th Major Mitchell  was requested  to get together somephotographs of work being done in this country.  Accordingly an excellentcollection of 49 whole-plate photographs (mounted) were taken, and althoughthe w-hole of  the space had been allotted, a suitable position  was eventuallysecured,  and the exhibits  were much appreciated.   At the close of  theexhibition the authorities requested that the collection  might be retainedfor the  purpose of forming an  exhibit in the War Museum.  A collection of the literature  distributed was obtained,  and a catalogueof the same is  attached  to this  report, the collection being placed in  thelibrary of the Ministry.  The visit was informative as to the character of  the  work being done  andthe importance the military  authorities of  France and  Belgium attach tothe re-education of the men, but there was little we saw  that we consideredcapable of being adapted to the scheme of training for  Great  Britain, wherethe decision as  to taking up  any course of training rests entirely with  theman.  Again, whilst in several of the centres we visited there  was  great activity.it did not  occur to us that  the  training was carried  far  enough.    Wegathered, however, that  in a number of cases the men,  after two or threemonths&apos; training, were received into factories or  workshops as improvers.We had no  opportunity of seeing the ultimate skill attained  by the men inany particular vocation.   We should, however, be averse to  recommending
  (5) THE PLACING AND EMPLOYMENT OF MEN IN CIVIL LIFE.- SECTION 111.                       REPORT BY LOUD LUAIINWOOD.   SIR,         YOU will have received the resolutions* adopted  by the section  of the Conference  which I had the honour of attending.  The subject  of dis- cussion of this section was the placing of discharged soldiers in an assured position in civil life-&apos;&apos; placement et etablissement des invalides.&quot;   1  on will observe  that the resolutions are in part  concerned with general principles of a somewhat obvious kind and in part with the special requirements of the organisation in France for the purpose in question.  1 do  not propose  to follow them minutely.  I see no reason to think that we have anything  to learn in this particular matter from the French system in so  far as it differs from oui- own,  and  1 am sure that my French colleagues are disposed  to agree  with me in this.   France had a  large army, and therefore a large number  of wounded men. long before we had.   Therefore, difficulties which now arise for us also were acutely realised somewhat earlier in France ;  but it is admitted that the best organisation for coping with them has not yet been thought out.   Monsieur Fuster,  the  reporter  of the section, dwelt  with  great  emphasis on the excellence of the system  adopted in England,  which  he  described very accurately, except that he did not yet know of steps which have been taken during the hist few weeks.  Our institution of a separate Ministry   of Pensions, with  Local Committees under  it,  and  the co-operation  which  is understood to take place between the Ministry and  that  of Labour and between the Local Committees and1 the Employment Exchanges, appeared  to him a  very good example for other countries.  In this opinion he  appeared to carry the general sympathy of the section with  him.  The  French War Office has created a special organisation for finding situa- tions for discharged  soldiers.  I  saw  M. le jCapitaine Billault.  a  former Colonial administrator, evidently of great energy and capacity, who is at the head of the  Office de Placement of the Department of the Seine,  where he has the advice, in the case of every soldier who presents himself, of  a medical officer of great reputation in  regard  to this question.  He appears to be in close touch and co-operation withseveral voluntary associations for the same purpose  which had existed  before his office was  created.  In tho 14 months of his work he has found places for about 4,000 of the men (about5,000)  who have presented themselves to  him.  The War  Department has set up  this organisation (which in name is  under it and the Labour Ministry jointly) from a sense that it is responsible for seeing its own men  through.* See Appendix II (1), Nos. 57-86.that men should be discharged from the training centres in Great Britainuntil they had  become much more proficient,  unless they wore under someagreement with the firm  they joined for the purpose of completing theirtraining.                    We are. Sir,                         Your obedient Servants,                                      E. A. STANTON.                                                  Lieutenant-Colonel.                                     ROBERT MITCHELL,                                                  Major.  Col. Sir Arthur Boscawen. M.P.,       Ministry of Pensions,                Great George Street, SAY.
In this instance the officer chosen for the work is manifestly well qualifiedfor it by his sympathetic understanding of soldiers, and in the selection ofemployments for men he is guided by a medical expert who devotes himselfwith evident enthusiasm to studying the capacity of, each particular man.It is, however, urged that the full knowledge of industrial life and processes,to which the civil department occupied with employment before the war canlay claim, ought to have been utilised for  this purpose.  Some authoritiesallege that for want of such knowledge men have been placed in unsuitablesituations, and that dissatisfaction is beginning to be felt among employersfor this reason.  It was. of course, not for me to enquire into the justice ofthis allegation against a service which was evidently being carried on withzeal and with a considerable measure of success.   But it is plain that thereis in this matter some wan^, of co-ordination and harmony between differentdepartments.   In  the light of French experience, our  own expedient of aspecial Ministry for this special work, charged with the clear duty of gettingrid of this evil, appears a very happy expedient.   The gist of the matter isexpressed in the resolutions of the Section which insist on the  equal  neees-sity, in placing disabled men, of medical advice and of expert  advice as tothe requirements of and the scope afforded  by particular  industries.  The  members of the  Section spoke  again and again of the patrioticand humane sentiment which for  the present  made employers  ready totake on disabled  men, and  of  the  certainty that this sentiment  wouldwear  out.  It  struck  me  that there was  no reference  to&quot; that sense ofpersonal  responsibility on the part  of  the master  towards  his  formerservant which in England  is an important factor in the problem.  I thinkit is evidently a pail of the service which our  Local  Committees  will dothat  they will  keep  alive the  interest of  employers  generally in  thisquestion.  1 gather,  however, that the Section concerned with  re-educationentered more largely into the question of local organisations.   The Section had no  difficulty in agreeing on the  obvious  principle ofequal  payment for equal  service as between the disabled pensioucr  andthe man who is neither  disabled nor pensioned, but  it was keenly feltthat  in the practical  application  of  this  principle  difficulties  betweenemployers and  trade unions must  arise.  Great  interest was  expressedin  the fact that our Labour Ministry is already assisting the Ministry ofPensions by appointing in various  trades joint  committees of employersand employed  to  explore  these difficulties in advance.   There was  a small  agricultural  group  present  in this  Section  whichstrove to insist that there should be a separate organisation for dealingwith  the needs of disabled agricultural workers.  This proposal  was ofcourse defeated by the  majority of the Section, who felt very strongly  thatthe industry of the  country must be looked at  and dealt with as a livingwhole.   But the  proposal clearly arose from a  prevalent  fear that  theresult of the war will  be to withdraw many men from  the land to townlife.   There has been, T am told, a desire manifested among French soldiersdrawn from the towns, just as among such men in  our own  Army, to bestarted as small farmers after the war.  But the tendency in  the oppositedirection seems to be regarded as more general.  Here, also, great interestwas taken in  the, fact that  (as I understand)  the  Board  of  Agriculturehas been moved  by  the Ministry of Pensions to set up a Committee of itsown  to study  the  question of the  discharged man  who  has  been anagriculturist.   I think the Section  felt acutely this  dilemma: on the one hand there is a great balance of advantage in  the disabled man&apos;s ceasing as soon aspossible to regard himself, or be regarded by others, as one of a class apart;on the other hand, he really is one of a  class  apart in this -respect  that medicine  and surgery  are likely for a long  time to  have  much to  do for him.  But nothing  much was said  as  to the  practical  solution of this difficulty.    There was also a  marked  tendency to speak of the disabled  man  as  if some  ideal combination of expert authorities was going to settle for him over  his head  what he  was going  to  do.  This, however,  only made  it more noteworthy that there was no suggestion whatever that compulsory
\ re-education was  possible.  A remark made by me at the end of the pro- ceediugs that the disabled man himself  was the ultimate authority  seemed to be accepted with most cordial agreement by everybody present.   Great approval  was also expressed  of  the  arrangement,  now adopted at home. whereby the Local Committee of the area in which  a man  is discharged will,  some  time before  his actual discharge,  try,  with the  assistance of the doctors and  nurses, to arouse the man&apos;s keenness and intelligence in regard  to his own future career, and will  before the man goes furnish the Committee  of the area  to which he  goes  with any information that may be helpful to them in ajtproaehing him.  I think  the  Section was disposed to accept the view that the tactful carrying out of work of this kind  by individuals (who,  it must be  admitted,  will not be  equally easy to  find in all localities) is the only real  solution of this vexed  question of compulsory training.   1 had a short but  interesting talk  on this question of compulsion with Captain Billault,  to whose evident knowledge of men  and how they should be handled I have already  referred:   His opinion  was most  emphatic, namely, that the  proposal of  compulsion looks practical enough so long as you consider only the very young men, but breaks down utterly  as soon as you  consider that it would  have  to be  applied also to  men who  are even a few years older and. in particular,  to married  men with families.   I think that, in conclusion, my personal  experience  of my relations with the Section is worth mentioning.  1 hardly spoke  at all during the dis- cussion  of the resolutions; but. when  all the business  was done and people were  quite  free to go if they liked. 1 attempted a short  address  calling attention  to several points in our own system to  which 1  have  already referred above.   Considering that 1113&apos; French is  halting and  inelegant. 1 felt that the ready understanding and  approval given to the  views which I  represented  as  the  English  views was very significant.  It is unmistak- able that  in this subject, and T  believe  in main- others, while  Frenchmen appreciate very highly readiness on our  part to study what they are doing and to  learn from it  what we can, they arc disposed  to assume that they themselves will have still more to  learn from our example.   I also came across evidence of  a very keen desire for the growth of a sort of &quot;&apos; entente &quot; bctVeen us  in matters  of  social policy, in which they can  profit  by our experience and  we by  theirs.    Visits like ours  thus  have  some little importance from a larger point of view than that  of the particular subject of our recent Conference, and are by no moans so futile as the somewhat similar  interchanges  of  visits between ourselves  and the Germans which were so eagerly promoted before the  war.                        I have  the honour  to be, Sir.                                        Your most  obedient  Servant,                                                  CIIARNWOOD.To Lt.-Col.  Sir A.

NICHOLSON.SIR,      You have  asked me to  express  my  opinion  on  the Inter AlliesConference on the subject of pensions and the care of the disabled  menheld in Paris.  The first meeting  was held  on the morning of Tuesday.8th May. when  the members divided  up  into the different  sections.  I  found  myself,  with  Sir  Arthur  Boscawen, attached  to  the  6thSection,  under the  presidency  of  Monsieur Honnorat,  the  deputy forBarcelonette.
  This section was  concerned with &quot; documentation  et  propagande,&quot; andhad to consider the best method of getting together the documents repre-senting the  practice of the  different  countries on the subjects of pensionsand treatment and  training, and also the best way of making the practiceknown to the sailors and soldiers of the different countries concerned.  The  onlv  papers  read before  this  section  were  those  presented  bySir Arthur  Boscawen on the new  Royal  Warrant and the practice  asit  affected  the whole of the  United Kingdom and myself on  the waythe work  was done by  the  Local  Committee  for the County of  London.  These papers  were  very  favourably received,  and  it  was quite  clearthat the methods pursued by this country  roused considerable interest inthe other members of the section, particularly with regard to the pecuniaryinducement  of 5s. a week to the soldier or sailor to go through a  course oftraining to  a new trade when he could not follow his old occupation.  The  French seeni to have  experienced  the  same difficulty that we havefound, namely, that  the disabled sailor or soldier was afraid that  if he,by  means  of a course  of  training, made  himself  capable  of earning,automatically by such an action his  pension  would  be  reduced:  and theyare endeavouring  to bring  it home  to each  man  that the pension  whenonce fixed is  permanent and  is not to be interfered  with whatever theman may earn, a course which in England  we are also  following.  The  work which  was  entrusted to our section was  quite simple, and,after some  discussion lasting over three  sittings, it was agreed that therepresentatives  of  the  different nations  should  send, in  the  Frenchlanguage, to  Monsieur Lncien March,  the  head  of the department  forcollecting statistics for France in Paris, all  documents bearing  upon thesubject of the conference,  and  that  the  Pensions Ministry  should  receivefrom  Monsieur  March copies of all the documents forwarded  by  othercountries  on the same  subject.  With regard to  the question of  propaganda,  a   resolution was  passedthat it was  advisable that all doctors and  nurses in the  various hospitalsshould be kept informed of the methods of  dealing with discha7-ged menin the various countries, and that they should be requested to keep theirpatients informed  of what  could  be done,  and should  urge upon eachman the advisability  of going through a course of training if lie  could notget back  to his old  work.  As regards the whole work of the Conference, it may be looked at fromthe points  of view  of  (i.)  Pensions, (ii.)  Re-education fonctionelle, ami(iii.) Re-education professionelle.  On these  three points there  was very  little information  forthcomingfrom  the representatives of Belgium, Italy,  Russia, Servia or  Portugal;but  as regards  France there was  plenty of  information, and mv onlvregret is  that there  was not sufficient time  to assimilate it.  (i.)  Pensions. These arc  at present  on a much  lower scale  than thescale of the United  Kingdom, and  are  regulated  by a  law  dating from1831, and it  has  been recognised for many years  that  the  scale is notsufficient, consequently, by  departmental  action, not  by law,  a  furthersystem  has  been inaugurated dating from 1853 (with subsequent modifica-tions and alterations) of &quot; gratifications renouvelables &quot; which  are  madefor periods  of two years,  but they  are  not  the  right  to which the manis entitled  by law,  the idea being  that the pension  is onlv given  whenit is recognised  that  the  man has  reached a state  when his capacitycannot be improved; until that time he receives only the  &quot;gratificationrenouvclable.&quot;  This  applies  only,  to those  who  are not  commissionedofficers.  So far as I could ascertain, on  leaving  hospital each private soldierreceives 1 franc 70  a day,  and if he goes  into a school of  &quot; re-educationprofcssionelle,&quot;  he is kept  free, but 1 franc 20  is  deducted, leaving  thoman  50 centimes a  day for pocket money.   It  takes from  three  to  sixmonths to  settle  the amount of the  &quot;gratification,&quot;  and when  this isfixed the 1 franc  70 stops  automatically;  but, as tho &quot;gratification&quot;is only paid quarterly and not in advance, the soldier is left with nothingto  go  on with for a period  of three months.   Steps arc being taken  toalter this and also  to revise the general scale.
  (ii) Schools of &quot;Re-education  Fonctioneilc.&quot; These  are  established  forthe purpose  of  enabling  the  man to  recover as far as possible from  stiffjoints,  damaged muscles and damaged  nerves, and it is  said  that  oneexists  in  every &apos;? region militaire,&quot;  and  in  several large  towns.    Themechanical apparatus is largely of the Zander t3&quot;pe, or modifications of  theZander type, and more attention is paid  to treatment by  passive move-ments  with this apparatus than is thought wise in Great Britain.  At  theGrand Palais arrangements are made for massage, hot air baths, electricity,and  various  forms of  baths.  During his stay in  these  &quot; schools &quot;  the  soldier appears to be  stillunder  military discipline, and from this  point  of view  the  advantage andbenefit  to him  would   appeal&apos; to  be  greater  than that  in England.   Ifwill  be remembered  that  a serious effort  was made in this  country  in  thesame direction so that the  soldier should  not  be  discharged until  it  wasclear that everything  that medical  and surgical skill could  do  for  himto fit him  for civil  life had  been done.  The  War Office,  however, tooka different view, and  urged that they were only concerned with keepingable-bodied soldiers  in the  firing-line and  also  that  if this further dutywas  placed   upon them the  machine  would  break  down.   Personally,  fthink that the War  Office was wrong in  taking this line, but  it must  notbe lost sight of that  in France  the soldier is treated  much more  like achild than in England.  (iii)  Re-education  Professionelle. The question  of teaching the  soldiera new  trade when he is unable to follow his old occupation is very differentin France to what  it  is  in  England.  The problems to  lie faced  are  insome respects similar to ours  and in  sonic respects different.   The greatestdifference lies in the  fact that  France is  much more an  agriculturalcountry  than England and  as most of the soldiers come  from  the classof men engaged in  agricultural  work, the question  of getting the  menback to  the  land is  much more  acute.   Moreover,  the  agriculture  of  thenorth of France differs completely from that  of  the south, and a greatdeal  of the discussion  turned on  these subjects.  Proposals  were  made toallow the disabled soldier to  borrow on the security of his pension up  totwo-thirds of its value so as  to  enable him to buy a small piece of landwhich he might  cultivate.  There  appears to be no system of small holdingsand  allotments  as we  know it.  France has many societies for  the  purpose  of discussing  the  variousquestions which  arise  in connection  with agriculture and  its  kindledpursuits, and certain  schools  as  well one  of which  we saw at Grignon but the number of places available there for disabled men was very small.  The  schools  for  teaching  new  trades seem  to  be  mostly  started  bycharitable effort supported by the State, and there appears to be nothingcorresponding to our technical institutes  or polytechnics. - In England we seem  to have been very slow in getting to  work  to makeuse of the possibilities at our disposal,  but we are now taking  steps  toco-ordinate these; in France, however, hardly any steps have been taken  inthis direction, probably due to the fact that there  is no Pensions Ministryto start  and  direct the policy, but the whole work is left in the hands  ofthree separate departments who  are  all  pulling against  each other.   Anattempt was made  to cure  this by  the establishment  of the  ConiiteNationale,  but up to the  present  very little has resulted.  I had no opportunity of seeing  the French schools myself, and all  that Ipicked up comes from conversations  with  various  delegates.  Up to the  present the  French  soldier  seems very shy of  accepting theoffers of &quot; re-education  professionelle.&quot;  I was also  told that some  of  the Syndicalists were  opposing the pro-posals  to train men  for new trades.C.

  (7) OBSERVATIONS AND OPINIONS OF COLONELS JOSEPH COWEN,  SIR THOMAS     OLIVER, JOSEPH KEKD, AND JOHNSTONE WALLACE  ON THE INTERNATIONAL     CONFERENCE HELD IN PARIS ON  MAY 9TH, 1917, AND SUBSEQUENT DAYS, TO     DEAL WITH  THE TRAINING OF SOLDIERS DISABLED DURING THE WAR.   Without preface it  may he said that the Conference from an Inter-Allied  point of view was a success.  As the subject which  mainly concerns us as  Trustees of an  Industrial  Training Home for disabled soldiers was hardly  alluded  to, although dealt with in a  paper  by  Sir  Thomas Oliver,  we  take this opportunity of  ventilating our views thereupon. The training  of disabled soldiers should only be undertaken where a reasonable prospect  is assured of getting them employment after training.   As far as wo have  been able  to ascertain, the prospect in  England is not  as  encouraging  as we had hoped for.   It would  appear  that  unless some definite arrange-  ment  is made with the Trades  Unions as to the conditions under which  disabled  soldiers may  be employed after  the war,  the  bulk  of  the  men  will  be  placed  on   the  unemployed  list.   The  main  points  are   the  following:     For the last 50 years the Trades Unions have been fighting  to  obtain a minimum wage.  They are, consequently, very reluctant  to allow  anything to interfere with  this&apos; principle.   Further, it may happen  in certain sections where a man uses only  his hands and  arms, that a man with an amputated  leg can do a full day&apos;s  work,  and  is therefore entitled to  be paid the same wages  as a  healthy  normal workman.  Should such a  cir- cumstance  arise,  or,  better  for our  argument, that  of  a  man who is working at the  next bench, also a discharged soldier, but whose physical strength, owing to  the war, has not been  sufficiently reduced to enable him to earn a pension, we would  then have the picture of  two men working side by  side,  both  having been wounded in the  war.   yet one  of  them receiving about  a  1  a week more  than  the other as well as the certainty of receiving this during  illness, strikes, and  old  age,  while the other would have absolutely nothing.   From the employers&apos; point of view, it  is felt that the emplo3&apos;ment of men with physical disabilities might materially increase  their  Workmen&apos;s Compensation Insurance;  at any rate,  in  all factories where  machinery is running  there  would be  an  increased  liability  to  accidents,  so that even  if  the same amount  of  work should  be  turned  out.  so  long  as a minimum wage obtained, the disabled men might really never get  a chance of  employment.   If  the men were employed at the  minimum  wage,  less the  amount allocated for  their  physical  disability,  then Trades Unions would  probably  raise  the  objection that  employers  were utilizing cheap labour at the expense of tho Government Pension.   To us it seems that in the fixing of a pension, some proportion should be allocated which,  when added  to the  wage paid  by the employer, the total would be not less than  the minimum wage of  the Trades  Union con- cerned,  and that some arrangement  might be  made  with the Trades Union Congress  to allow men to  commence work  on some  such  basis, as unless men are able to  commence work the whole of the safeguards of the Royal Warrant do not come into operation.  We have  had  a letter this  week from  the Manchester  Typographical Society, which,  from  the  attitude  assumed, clearly indicates  that  it is useless to train  disabled  men who come  under this Society  since  they would not be  able  to obtain situations.  The  question  of the actual  discharge  from  the Army is a source  of great divergence of  opinion.  We  think  that  after finishing with  the hospital, a man  should be allowed 10 days&apos; furlough  ; that further treat ment  should be  incorporated with  his   training, and  that on the cbm- pletion of his training, his pension should be allocated; also  that as  anencouragement to him  to undergo a course of individual training he shouldbe rewarded by  a monetary  payment on  the satisfactory completion  ofsuch training by an amount not exceeding  10.
  In the Museum and Exhibition of apparatus  we saw nothing,  apartfrom what we have seen in England, which appealed to us.  The simplicityof the Swedish  model  for a lost arm, however,  is worthy of close andcritical  inspection on  account  of its cheapness and  efficiency.  This wasparticularly the case in regard  to its application for  such agriculturalwork as digging, and mowing hay. &amp;c.  lie capitulation:      (1) Unless  arrangements can be made to allow men  to  start work          under Trades Union  Regulations,  men  should not lie trained          to these trades.    (2) The Royal Warrant safeguards  only come  into operation after the          man obtains employment.    (3) Unless arrangements can be made for men to commence work at          the  trade  to  which they have been trained, no good purpose  is          served by  training them.    (4) Men who have been discharged from the Army should not be asked          to work side by side under different wage conditions.    (5) The Swedish model  of arm deserves  further consideration.                                                JOSEPH COWEN.

APPENDIX  IT.(1) AN  INTER-ALLIED CONFERENCE  FOR THE STUDY OF  PROFESSIONAL  on      TECHNICAL  RE-EDUCATION AND  OTIIKK  MATTERS OF  INTEREST TO MEN      DISABLED IN THE WAR.Resolutions passed in Full Session  on May 11th.  1917.          FUNCTIONAL RESTORATION AND MEDICAL GYMNASTICS.  1. That surgeons should be urged  to send their cases for physical treat -ment  earlier than they  at present do, before scars and injuries to jointsbecome too fixed.  2. That a proper surgical staff should  be  attached  to  the  institutes ofphysiotherapy, so that surgeons at  the front could send the men to theseinstitutes very soon after being wounded.  3. That competent  medical  men,  with a  knowledge of  physiotherapy,should be made consultants to advanced medical  units.  4. That medical  gymnastics  should  only be practised  by  a  competentpersonnel (doctors,  &quot;medical gymnasts.&quot;  medical students, tfec).  5. That medical gymnastics  should be  begun as early as possible  in thetreatment of injured  limbs,  and that several &quot;medical gymnasts&quot;  shouldbe placed in  the large surgical hospitals at the front,  where medicalgymnastics will be more useful than mechanotherapy.  6. Only qualified persons, conversant  with the theory and practice ofrational  physical  re-education should be admitted to  schools  of mechano-therapy,  whether as assistants or supernumeraries.  7. That gymnastic instruction and re-educative  combined exercises shouldbe directed  by trained  instructors of  gymnastics and  under  the strictsupervision of a medical man with a knowledge of physiotherapy.  8. Steps should be taken in all countries to establish centres  of  generalinstruction in medical gymnastics.
                   FUNCTIONAL RESTORATION BY WORK.   9. Schools of  functional  restoration should  be placed under  the sole&apos;Control of the Services of Public Health.   10. Physical re-education (to wit, massage, gymnastics, mechanotherapy,manual  work) should be  entrusted only  to qualified persons,  and oughtnot to  be confused with  technical re-education, which  is applicable  onlyto those who have been invalided.   11. The work  prescribed as an adjunct to physio-therapeutic treatmentshould be compulsory in physio-therapeutic  institutions.   12. That  treatment by agricultural labour, the most frequently used  onaccount of the large number of wounded who were engaged on agriculturalwork or.work of that nature, cannot be organised  on  the  same lines  inevery district; in organising such  treatment, full allowance must be madefor local methods of cultivation.  The various methods of working  regulate,in fact,  the kind and the  number  of workers who can be employed in anygiven area.  Any organisation which  does not take this point-into accountis doomed to failure, which will be most  regrettable, both with regard  tothe cure of  the wounded and to the work done for the nation.   13. Technical work should be considered an adjunct to  physio-therapeutictreatment,  but on the express condition  that  in every case the  work  beselected  by the doctor and carried  out under his closest supervision.   14. A patient undergoing  medical  treatment  in  a hospital  should notbe admitted to a workshop for technical re-education unless he be able  todevote a sufficient number of hours to enable him to learn or  to re-learnin  a thorough manner.  He will, of course, have  to produce a medicalcertificate.       &quot;PROTHESIS&quot; AND MECHANICAL ADJUNCTS OF  RE-EDUCATION.   15. The scientific study of the prothesis  of limbs should be encouraged.   16. The use of crutches  in  treating men who have had a leg  amputatedshould be forbidden on principle.   17. Articulated artificial aids for the treatment  of  joint  affections  ormuscular paralysis, should be provided only after careful  clinical, electrical,and ergographical examination  of the patient, carried out by  qualifieddoctors.   There are several reasons  for  this.    In  the  first place, somemutilated persons are very  anxious to be supplied  with apparatus whichare really not required  for  the  resumption of their work; in  the secondplace,  orthopaedists have  a tendency to  supply  artificial aids which  inmany  cases  hinder the  desired  results;  and   finally,  badly  constructedapparatus, so  far  from helping the  wounded,  are  injurious  and  hindertechnical re-education.   18. Artificial limbs to assist work ought, in the case of  a patient who haslost his arm or forearm, to satisfy certain essential  conditions,  be simple,strong, but light, and easy to repair.  Moreover,  they must be well fittedand be one,  so to speak, with  the stump.   The user should find them, whenhe is doing his work, neither uncomfortable nor tiring, but a valuable help.   19. Every effort should be made to perfect the  mechanical adjuncts of re-training, some of which, it must be confessed, do not as yet give the desiredresults.  We are convinced that fresh improvements will soon materialise.In this way, we shall put all the wounded, without exception, into whom wemay instil a taste for work, on the road to earn wages which assure  the well-being of themselves and their families.   Thus  we shall  promote economicrecovery in all the countries that are allies in the cause of  right and justice.  20. We consider that there will be room for devising a specialised  workinghand, furnished with the necessary tools, for almost every trade.  In short,there will be scope for differentiating artificial hands.  21. In view of the importance of perfecting the apparatus of mechanicalorthopaedics and the aids to re-training and of concentration and the betteruse of schemes  of study, it is desirable that a Board of Research and Studyshould be established in each one of the Allied countries.   To combine the
necessary qualifications the Board should be composed of medical specialists.engineers, technical experts and representatives, of the wounded who  have-been  fitted with  apparatus, . The duties of the Board.would be:      1. To study schemes submitted to them.    2. To act as a link-between the various centres of re-education.  22. An Inter-Allied Commission should without  delay  be constituted toexamine everything that bears  upon artificial aids  (prothesis).  This Corn-mission should include persons  of various qualifications, such as surgeons,orthopsedio , surgeons, technical  experts  and-in a. consultant capacity manufacturers.                                    -   ..&quot;                       PENSIONS AND GRATUITIES.  23. The laws dealing with military pensions should be revised and  takeinto account not merely the physical incapacity  of the invalided,  but thenumber  of his children and his responsibilities to his family-  and directrelatives. &apos;  24. Special cases should be specially studied so that the loss suffered maybe equitably compensated, due  account being taken of previous  circum-stances and of the circumstances which  may  result  from disablement.                 PROFESSIONAL OR TECHNICAL GUIDANCE.  25. Technical civilian advisers should  be appointed at once, their missionbeing to  give advice to men disabled in the war as to their future while theyare still under medical treatment and  before their technical re-educationor discharge-advice, that is  to say,  as to the advantage there might be,according to circumstances, in keeping  to their old trade or in choosing anew one, and, if so, which.  Close collaboration between doctor and technical advisers is indispensable-for complete re-education.  It is also indispensable for guiding the injuredman and starting him on sound lines from the outset of his re-education.But the direction must never be pressed, goodwill on the part of  the patientbeing an essential factor for success.  Re-education must follow immediately after medical treatment, and evenoverlap  it.            &apos; -i  &apos;26. For assistance in his choice of a trade, the patient  should receiveadvice from medical, educational, technical and social  experts.  The Wounded &quot;should be questioned closely as to their knowledge,  theirformer trade,  their tastes  and aptitudes, their family  responsibilities,  theirplans for the  future and their  financial circumstances.  The patient, after visiting several workshops to obtain clear ideas, shouldhimself choose his own  calling.  If need be, he  should  be given advice,especially by&quot; the doctor, whose duty  it will be  to  decide whether thepursuit  of the craft  chosen  is  compatible with the  man&apos;s physical con-dition. &apos;       --- \ 27.&apos; Advisers should take pains to interest each wounded man in  his newcalling,&apos;  showing him  in  a concrete  manner what  are the possibilities ofhis settling down in any  particular place and what  are the prospects ofsuccess.  When  the patent has finally  made up his  mind, he will  be admitted tothe workshop selected.  If,  after a short probationary  period, he  showsmarked aptitude, he will be kept there; otherwise he will again be  inter-viewed by his advisers.                                        -  28. Advisers should, so far  as is possible, lay the following principles to-heart:&apos;- . ... (a) Unless, it he contrary to the patient&apos;s interests, he should be re-          educated..in his old trade,, or in some kindred  trade.    (b) So far, as, is possible  he should  be restored to  his  old trade,          especially  if it be  agriculture;  and,  if possible, be  found  a          position  technically   superior  to  that  which   he  previously          occupied.&apos;
     (c) Only  patients who have  sufficient education ,and mental&apos; qualifi-           cations-as  proved  by a  preliminary examination should be           encouraged  to follow non-manual occupations.     (d) A man should be made  an artificer rather than a factory  hand;           he  should be  encouraged to  take up a  trade in which manual           skill  is least  common  and  most indispensable  rather, than to           enter on one where the market is overcrowded.  , ;   29. As  far as possible men disabled  in  the war  should  be kept in. their- old technical  surroundings.                        - . &apos;  -   30. Wherever possible disabled men should  be  kept  in the districts wherein they  lived before the  war.                             - .   31. In the choice of an occupation consideration should  be  given to the openings  afforded  and the ease of finding employment.   32. Men confined to hospital and  the totally disabled  should have  re- served for them certain  small jobs which could give occupation but would never  be  trades.   33. Trades  for  new apprentices should  be  selected  from among those which  will yield a living wage  in  less than a year. .   34. As  a general principle, before  seeking  a new trade  for the patient every effort should be  made  to give him such  instruction  as will refit him for his former trade.                PROFESSIONAL on TECHNICAL RE-EDUCATION.   35. The conference is of the  opinion  that compulsory re-education is the only complete  solution of the  problem.  But  on the  other hand as com- pulsion encounters obstacles difficult to  overcome all&apos; at once in  some countries, the  Conference trusts that public  authorities will  assist  hj all appropriate means technical re-education  and  resumption of work.   36.  All  men wounded or crippled in the war whom it has been impossible to re-educate  during the course  of hostilities, have a  claim  to technical re-education as a  right.   37.  In default of compulsion, qualified  delegates shall be appointed by the State to induce those interested to take advantage  of this right.   38.  During  the  period of re-education, in addition to pensions and sub- sistence allowances, apprenticeship premiums shall be paid and allowance shall continue for those  dependent on  the wounded.   39.  The State shall give financial assistance to private institutions that submit to its  control and  which are  organised  to  assure, complete  re- education, and  shall  support or  even  inaugurate schools  of  re-education wherever  necessary. .                               , .      .....   40.  The wounded and maimed  men  who accept re-education and show themselves eager to re-adapt and  train themselves  fully, showing a  praise- worthy effort thus definitely to increase their value to,society,  are entitled. as public  bodies have declared officially on several,occasions, to the full- enjoyment of  their .grants or  pensions.  Moreover, it would  be desirable to ask  the  State  to  encourage  re-education  by granting  to those  who, after suffering  wounds  or loss of limbs,  have  been  re-educated,  sundry advantages, such  as premiums in cash, advances of money, facilities for setting up in business,  rights of priority, &amp;c,  as  a reward, for  their goodwill and  their wish to  resume an  active  part in society in spite of their  injuries.                                         .           ,   41. In view  of the constancy  of  the psychic factor in all  matters relating to the technical  re-education  of the  disabled, it  is  necessary,  in  re- education, to  unite psycho-therapeutics with  physio-therapeutics and to recognise  the  psycho-therapeutic  value of technical work.            -   42.  Technical re-education should be planned on broad lines, scientifi- cally and humanely.   It must  not be entrusted  to amateurs.   It includes general instruction and  education as well as technical training! It aims.at improving  the physical and  moral  health of the &apos;disabled.   &apos;43. The re-education of the wounded falls  into two  periods:       (1) That  of functional  restoration by work,,  the object  of which is           to  cure the   wounded,  prepare  them  for. instruction  and           encourage them to work.J  ---7--rr^v
    (2) That  of  technical re-education,  which  begins  as  soon as  the          injuries are healed and is  intended to restore morally,  intel-          lectually and practically, those who have  limbs.  Intellectual restoration  includes  general and technical instruction,  thescope of which  may be summed up under the following heads:      (a) Tools.    (b) Raw materials.    (c) Processes  of  manufacture.    (d) Cost price and the market for articles manufactured.    (e) Working  drawings.  In practical  restoration empirical processes  must be excluded  from thecourse of instruction,  nor must  the elementary exercises of the  workshopbe prolonged, but the  apprentices should be trained in up-to-date methodsof work.  44. In districts where there is a local industry, schools  for apprenticesshould be  established and reserved for  disabled  men belonging to thosedistricts.  45. Schools  of  technical  re-education  should  be  placed  under  thesupreme control  of a committee  including  (1)  doctors;  (2) representa-tives  of  workmen&apos;s  and  employers&apos;  associations;  (3)  mechanics;   (4)sociologists;  (5)  members of various teaching  bodies;  (6)  re-educatedpersons.  46. The  principal  of every school  should make  it a point of honourto keep  his  pupils with him only so  long as  is  absolutely necessary fortheir apprenticeship,  and do his best to restore his pupils,  as soon asqualified, to  ordinary life by finding them situations  in their new calling.  47. It is desirable  that periodical  meetings should be  held  in  everydistrict for the exchange  of  opinion between  the doctor in charge  of thedistrict  centre  for  prothetic apparatus and  re-education  and the prin-cipals  of public  and  private re-educational  schools, so that  they mayco-ordinate their efforts and start the  patient forthwith  in the callingbest suited to  his injuries and  technical  antecedents.  48. District  organisations  should collect,  for the use of  disabled menalready re-educated, information showing  the  demand for workers&quot; in eachdistrict.  49. The results of the statistical  investigations made by the Ministry ofLabour, with regard  to the  demand  for labour,  should  be communicatedwithout loss  of  time to the management of the  various schools for technicalre-education.  50.  (a) Heads of industries and  crafts,  acting, where  need be, in colla-             boration  with qualified persons,  such  as doctors, psychologists,             technical experts, &amp;e, should be invited to define as precisely             as possible the particular qualifications required for the kind of             work with which they are  respectively concerned (specialisa-             tion, co-ordination, strength,  skill, frequency  and rapidity of             movement, delicacy of touch,  mental keenness, &amp;c).               They  should be  asked  to indicate the principal  or special             fatigues  (muscular, nervous,  sensory and mental)  caused by             various kinds of work done by their staff.       (6) Information thus obtained should be grouped and classified, with-             a view to forming a collection of  monographs on handicrafts,             callings and trades, and so  making it possible to guide indivi-             duals to  a choice of occupation in  accordance with their  health             and  qualifications.       (c) Besides the health record there should be  (in agreement with             physiological and psychological practice) a record of the motor,             sensory and  mental development  of the person tested, and of             the habits, tastes, education and technical capabilities of those             who can  be re-educated; records which should be communicated             (without in the first instance giving the names of the subjects)             to heads of businesses, to  enable them to  fill  vacancies on their             staff.
   51. The patient, whether he has undergone amputation or not, if he show goodwill, should  he assured of  the devoted help of  his foreman  and his- - medical specialist.  Their threefold collaboration should often  secure  the devising of suitable tools or the modification of machine tools so as to yield the maximum output.   52. Re-educational  schools should, speaking generally, be planned on a  . large scale, and have a large number of pupils able to choose from among many crafts  and courses of instruction.   In this way  the pupils can be distributed systematically  and be  given  good  instructors and foremen,. besides all the equipment needed for instruction and running the workshops.   Nevertheless, it should  not be forgotten that small schools are useful for &apos; keeping in their home districts patients who wish to stay near home, and for facilitating apprenticeship to certain special industries.   53. A school of re-education should, wherever possible, be close to a large hospital; also to centres of nerve-treatment, physio-therapy and fitting with artificial limbs, &amp;c.   54. Commercial and civil service; courses should be given in every higher- grade technical college or school established near a centre of hospital treat-.ment or discharge, in order that  candidates for this  kind of  re-educationmay not waste valuable time in the  interval between the  beginning of con-valescence and that of their discharge.  55. Apprenticeship schools for persons injured in war or civil  industrieswho propose to take the simplest courses of instruction drawn  up for eachof the various technical sections  should not be  regarded by the publicauthorities as charities, but  as institutions for technical  instruction.  56. After as well  as  during the war, leaving  certificates at the end ofapprenticeship  should  be granted by technical commissions, which shouldinclude representatives of employers  and of workmen selected from amongthose maimed and re-educated.                        FINDING MEN EMPLOYMENT.   57. There is no need, in most cases, to set  up special workshops in  in- dustrial establishments for men disabled  in the war.   58. The disabled man should  receive  for a  given output the same pay as an able-bodied workman.   In no case should the pensions legally granted to disabled men be made a reason for reducing wages below those usually given to able-bodied work- men in the same district for the same class of work.   59.  As a general principle, finding employment for the  disabled should^be entrusted to bodies legally empowered to find work for  able-bodied workers,  with the exception of the employment bureaux of  all kinds that charge fees.   There is no reason for separating agriculture from other  kinds of work as regards finding men employment.   Where  berths are found  directly for their pupils  by technical schools or by local committees  and war committees for men  in their charge, these employment bureaux should be co-ordinated with public iabour exchanges, which ought to be informed regularly of any situations  filled.   It  is important that  schools  of  re-education  should continue to  find situations for their pupils,  but not without  first  consulting the  Com- mittee of the district from  which the patient comes,  so that he may return to his home neighbourhood.   60. Employment agencies, both public and private, should, when seeking work for the disabled, make, in  addition to the general rules applying to. able-bodied workmen,  very  strict  regulations in regard to  security of employment, conditions of work and rate  of  wages,  as well as to sub- sidiary advantages.  There is scope for  regulating the local employment of disabled men by drawing up  a list of the  trades which have  the  best demand in  each.district.                                 -
                                   38                                    1  61. Employers are under an obligation to give work, wherever oppor-&quot;tunity offers, to the disabled.  62. Regulations  should  make public bodies  responsible for  a certainpercentage  of the  men  who have  lost limbs and been re-educated or re-qualified.  63. The  regulations for examinations for  the  public services  should  beso revised as to allow disabled  men to  profit by the advantages  offeredthem, and their preparation for examinations should  be facilitated.  64. (a)  The organising of manufacturing and  agricultural  co-operative          societies should  be  encouraged.  (b) Motive power and special machines should  be provided  for patientsworking at home in cases where they are asked for.  (c) A loan bank should be organised to  assist persons who at the time ofbeing  mobilised found themselves  faced  by a situation  which  has to  lieretrieved in connection  with a business, a contract, public liability, or the-development of  land.  (d) The labour market should be organised.  65. The facilities for borrowing  given to disabled agriculturalists shouldbe extended to disabled  artisans to enable them to buy tools and set up insmall businesses (either  by capitalising part of their pension  or  by specialftinds).  66. The  Allied Governments should  consider the institution of a CreditMobilier for disabled and discharged men,  with a view  to  allowing the-disabled and especially those who  may have been re-educated to purchaseworking tools and raw materials needed for setting up a small business.     AGRICULTURAL RE-EDUCATION AND  THE FINDING OF  AGRICULTURAL           &quot;  -                 EMPLOYMENT.   67. A return to the land seems more and more desirable for the majority -of disabled  men, particularly for all those suffering from shell-shock, even in  some  cases for  those  with serious injury to  their  nervous systems. (Section  7).   68. With  due regard for personal liberty a special point should be made of  returning  all  wounded  and  maimed  agriculturists   to  the&quot; land. i (Section 2.)   69. Men  capable of being re-educated  should be approached while still under military discipline and  concentrated, and not be  left till they have been  discharged,  returned to  civil life and dispersed.   (Idem.)   70. The resumption of  agricultural  work  should  be  put before them tactfully and be adopted as a complementary treatment.  (Idem.)   71. Injured agriculturists should be returned to the land as quickly as possible,  and not await in  idleness  at a medical  centre the  payment of pensions or  the construction of apparatus.  (Section  3.)   72. Agriculturists should be encouraged to  undergo technical  education in exceptional cases only,  and  when  the  patient  is unable to  return to the land.   .   &apos;   73., Men should take advantage of a stay of some months duration in a treatment centre in their  home district to improve  their too  imperfect ;technical education.   (Section 2.)   74. Goodj  simple  and practical instruction  should be arranged for and the  knowledge necessary for  enabling an  agriculturist to improve and perfect himself in the special branch selected by him should be put  within his reach.-   75. Ministries of Agriculture and all agricultural experts should provide this instruction in such institutions and with such equipment as they havei at command.  (Idem.) .76. The closest  possible  touch should be  established between schools of re-education and  Ministries of Education in  order to carry out  this pro- gramme with  the least&apos; delay and  to the greatest national advantage. (Idem.)   77. Independently of special schools devoted exclusively  to  agricultural re-education, it would be  desirable to see practical instruction in market -gardening,  arboriculture  and  stock  raising  on  a small  scale  given  in
  gardens round the technical schools for the benefit of artisans undergoing  a course of technical training;  meetings and lessons given in .hours not  devoted to technical instruction would impart invaluable theoretical and  scientific knowledge.  (Idem.)                                   ;. .    78. An active propaganda in favour of agricultural re-education should  be set on foot not only among the disabled but  further  and particularly  among                    ,               -     ..      -     ,      (1) Re-educational bodies and those that find employment  for dis-           abled men;      (2) Municipal bodies and teachei-s in rural  districts.    Propaganda  should have  for  its  basis  convincing  observations  made  on re-educated  persons  and  be  illustrated wherever  possible  by photo-&apos;  graphs.                                                              &quot; *   Attention must  again  be  drawn  to the danger  of placing agriculturists  too soon in  public or private employment, and to the &quot;great  importance,  both to society and to the individual, of leaving agriculturists on the land and  completing their  agricultural  training.   79. To keep the peasant on the land and induce the disabled to return to it,  landowners should be  asked to  take more interest in their  pro- perties  and, acting  on the  advice  of qualified persons, to; improve . their farms  in a  manner  essential  to  assuring  their  good and remunerative development.  (Idem.)   80. Workers on  the land  should  benefit equally. with those engaged in manufacture  by  the  advantages  granted  by legislation  in  regard  to accidents incurred in the course of work.  (Section 3.)   81. Steps to  enable disabled men  to  acquire land  should be taken as soon  as possible, and the right be  granted to  the recipient of a military pension to commute  a part thereof  and provide capital which shall be laid  out under the supervision of  a  qualified  authority  on the purchase of  land and agricultural equipment.             . .   82. Ministries of  Agriculture  should institute  centres  of  instruction for minor local  rural  industries  while  forming associations to  assure to- the workers the usual wages recognised  by Ministries of Labour.   (Idem-.)&apos;   83. Posts in  public  services  should be reserved for  disabled  men  who cannot  return  with advantage to agricultural occupations; for example. men  who have  lost or become  paralysed  in both  arms or both legs,  the blind, &amp;c.  (Idem.)                                .                            Permanent  Kelp.     -., .  ....  84.  Employers&apos; associations, assisted  and advised by  central  organisa- tions  of propaganda and information,  should  co-operate with the State, benefit  societies, trades-associations and individual disabled men to&apos;give permanent help to men injured in the. war, whenever such help mar be needed,  starting from  the day on  which the injury was  received. - 85.  The allied nations - should  pass  with all   possible  speed laws to regulate  the methods  of granting  to the  disabled protection  and help on  the  same  conditions  as  natives of  the country  in  which they may follow their  callings,  if only  temporarily.  86.  That full and permanent help be  assured to the totally disabled.                             ^ The  mind;     ..  . &apos;.           ? .  87. (a) Pre-Ue-education. The   creation  of.  small  workshops&apos;. near ophthahnological centres and ophthalmic departments, in. hospitals should be made compulsory.  It will not be sufficient to begin technical re-education in these little workshops as soon  as the patients&apos;  condition permits;  special care must be  taken to make  the blind person pass  easily .from his previous to hisnew environment.                                   &apos;&apos;&quot;          &quot;&apos;  ,  He  must be protected from clumsy  and disheartening expressions ofsympathy.                   ...                 .....             &apos;  Care  must be taken that  his loss of  sight be.&apos;broken rto  him&apos; withallthe tact  demanded by his sensitiveness and physical condition.
  Every effort must be made to  encourage and enlarge his  relations  withhis family either by helping them to visit him or by  giving  the blind&apos;man facilities for going home so far  as his condition and the necessitiesof medical treatment permit.  Instruction in Braille should be begun.  All possible steps should be taken  to put him in  communication  withpeople who can  see, both by methods of writing in ink and the Cantonnetsystem of typhlography, which is  worth adopting.  He should be made  to  understand  that, though he has  suffered loss,he is not necessarily of no  value; and that he will  by work be enabledto build  up for himself  a  new  existence in which he  will find meansto enjoy again a  self-respecting,  active  and happy life. * He should be guarded against being lured into marriage  with a womanwho is  drawn to him only by pity or  self-interest.  Finally, it should always be kept  in mind that the  teacher&apos;s duty  isconcerned less  with immediate  results than with  assuring the blindedman&apos;s future.  88. (b) Re-education. As soon as  their condition permits, the  blindshould be taken to the school of re-education nearest to their homes, andshould on no pretext be kept at  the centre of ophthalmic treatment longerthan is absolutely necessary for the curing of their injuries.   Principals of schools will  endeavour to  follow out the recommendationsgiven below.   At the school  each patient should be given an instruction in the trade bestsuited to his condition,  knowledge and capacity.   For this reason a distinction must be made between the townsman, whoseapprenticeship  should  be continued  until the  greatest  possible skill  is obtained, and the countryman, who, being able to live more cheaply and to undertake small farming  jobs which he can still obtain, will only need to add to  his pension what he can earn by small trades; for example, by brush- making,  chairmaking,  basketmaking, shoemaking,  for  which he will findcustomers in the immediate neighbourhood.   This  Conference expresses the hope that people  interested in the  blind will devote  their efforts to  discovering well-paid callings which  may be followed by blind men of superior education clerks, students, professional military officers, &amp;c.   Before a pupil leaves the school the managers should explain to his family what moral and material  help  is required by blind people.     89. (c) The return home.  The Conference expresses the hope that the increase promised  in the pension now given to those  wounded in the war, by raising the figures fixed by the law  of 1831, may be granted at once; that account will be taken  of several  infirmities and family  responsibilities existing and to come; that the increase will not be given by the State under the name of &quot; help &quot;;  and that all wounded men, without distinction  of rank, shall be invited to benefit to the extent shown on the scale of pensions.   On leaving the school, every blind person, whether peasant, artisan, clerk, student, &amp;e, shall be given the tools or instruments needed in the calling which  he is able to  follow.   The  equipment will be suited  to meet all his needs; in particular,  blind men who have lost an  arm will receive the special knife invented by M. Lotz.   This Conference  expresses the hope that the purchase of  Jaw materials and the sale of manufactured articles will be .made easy for blinded men who return home,  and be  so conducted as to prevent stoppage of work.      I. By the State, by granting facilities of transport and reserving their           orders for the  blind.     II. By  private  associations, by  assuring them permanently  of  pre-           f erential rates when purchasing raw materials.   Finally, it is desirable that families living near the blind should give them their custom, moral support and such advice as they may need, and, further, on occasion  act as  intermediaries between them and public bodies or private associations. .                                                   1
                              THE DEAF.  90. Lip-reading should he regarded as the only useful method  of  re-educating those who are totally deaf in both ears.  Instruction should begiven them by  teachers in deaf mute institutions and not by amateurs.  91. From the point of view of social intercourse re-education of the ears,designed to enable the deaf  to use such powers of hearing as they may stillretain, should begin at the same time as lip-reading.  92. It  would be useful to  establish  a brotherhood of those who lost theirhearing  in the war, to bring them together and reconcile  them to theirchanged  conditions of life.     THOSE SERIOUSLY DISABLED BY INJURIES TO THE NERVE  CENTRES.  93. Men whose nerve centres have  been  seriously injured  and still needcare and medical attendance should not be left to themselves nor be sentback to  their families if  these cannot provide the close attention of anextended and costly nature which they must have.   They should be  col-lected  in special institutions, since nothing can  be done for  them  bysurgeons or nerve specialists.  It is importantftbat premises reserved for them should be fully up to the-standard of modern-hospital buildings, and  also be tastefully and  attrac-tively furnished,  so that the patients  may feel more comfortable there thanthey were in their previous quarters.   It is  highly undesirable that thesemen, to  whom  one;is all the more  indebted  because  they  have sufferedgreatly and must suffer mentally and physically  in  the future,  shouldimagine  for one moment that they are herded into an asylum as incurablebecause they would be-burdensome elsewhere..:  These patients should&apos;be returned to their home districts, and to that endspecial accommodation  should be provided in the principal town of each-district or close to it, so that relatives and friends may often visit them.  Where such establishments are in a town it will be advisable to have aholiday home near by in the country to which the patients  may be trans-ferred during part of the fine season.  Such  a home has been provided fordisabled  men of this class concentrated at the Hotel des Invalides in Paris.A single institution in the country near  an important   centre&quot; wouldobviously be a  cheap substitute for two separate establishments.  This class of  patient  requires  special care  and individual  medical atten-tion given  by a medical staff and  trained nurses.  The  whole future of these patients depends on the care  they receive.Given constant care and a well-thought-out system of functional re-educa-tion, astonishing  improvement may be anticipated in some cases.  Some ofthe patients  may be able to benefit by technical re-education and fit them-selves for town  occupations,  or, preferably, for country pursuits.  94. Assistance should be given to patients whose capacities have been de-creased (by trepanning, for example), by arranging  special  workshops forthem or by finding them employment  and so preserving their self-respect.  95. Having before it the  experience gained in two years or so in  theschool at Ondes and  the  results obtained there, this Conference hopes tosee similar institutions established,  and Government schools- being used forthe purpose.   MEN  SERIOUSLY DISABLED BY INJURIES  TO THE PERIPHERAL NERVES.  96. With a view to decreasing the number of incurables suffering frominjuries  to the peripheral nerves, it  is desirable that the wounded shouldhe examined, immediately  after  entering a field  hospital,  by a nervespecialist, and  be tended by him.  The latter should keep  an eye on hispatient until he  is cured  or reaches the final stage,  decide when an opera-tion is advisable, be  present  at  it, and  afterwards ,take command ofphysiotherapic  and re-educationl treatment,  both functional and technical.  It is  desirable that,  to  attain  this end, nerve  specialists  should beattached to field stations.
  It is  indispensable that detailed records should be kept  of all personsinjured in the  peripheral nerves.  Only  wounded  men  who show considerable or incurable incapacity dueto injury to the  peripheral nerves will after a very careful examination.be classed with those seriously disabled by lesions of the nerve centres.              MEN  DISABLED BY DEFINITE MENTAL TROUBLES.   97. Men disabled in the  war  and  showing  persistent mental  failure should, more than  any others partly because of the difficulty they have in acquiring fresh  technical ideas,  partly because of the value of auto- matic  action and experience already acquired be kept to their old trades and  restored to their old  environment, if this lie feasible, as soon as they .are fit for re-education.                     DOCUMENTATION AND  PROPAGANDA.   98. Since the problem of dealing  with men,  as concerns both  pensions. technical  re-education, the  finding  of employment  and social help, is -common to all  countries of the Entente,  and inasmuch as it is important that each country  should seek solutions  in harmony  with the results of experience:   And inasmuch as these  results cannot  be attained except by organising an inter-allied  service of  documentation  on the  subject:   This Conference records the wish:         That,  while awaiting the establishment of such a service by general     agreement  among the Governments  interested, La  Direction  de la     Statistique Generale  de la France shall  be immediately  empowered     to collect  documents, to  issue  publications  and to  communicate to     the allied States such details as may be required on all points.   99. La  Comite Franco-Beige of  this   Inter-Allied  Conference  should :start as. soon as possible  the publication  of a  periodical Review for the Allies on &quot;prothesis,&quot;  orthopaedics, and all subjects relating to functional and  technical re-education.   100.  Active and  co-ordinated propaganda should be  promoted in each allied country  b)-  pamphlets,  meetings,  lantern  shows,  entertainments, &amp;c.:       (1) In order to  make known in all parts of the country the resolutions           adopted by  the  Inter-Allied  Conference.     (2) In order to  make  the disabled understand the reasons which have           guided  these resolutions and  the advantages which accrue from           them to themselves and to  the State;     (3) In order  to counteract obstructive  movements and  propaganda,           both  open and  secret.   101.  To  facilitate  technical education:     . (1) Public authorities should undertake the cost of this  re-education           as  well as the  cost of supporting the patient  and  his family           while re-education  is proceeding;   .(2) Special  propaganda should be, carried on among doctors, hospital           nurses,  and institutions engaged in  re-education,  to give a           definite aim to  their endeavours to  guide their  patients  on          sound lines and to bring about a standardisation of schemes in          conformity with the  resolution  of  the  Conference, while taking           into  account the normal opportunities in  each  district.   102. A permanent Committee should be  appointed to maintain  the con- nections established  by the Conference between institutions and individuals who have taken part in its work, and to  arrange further nieetings.of theConference.
(2)  ITALIAN  LAW OF  MARCH  25TH,  1917, &quot; FOR  THE  CARE  AND HELP  OF                          DISABLED SOLDIERS.&quot;                               SUMMARY.    BY FOSCOLO BARGONI  (AVOCAT)  AND PROFESSOR LUIGI BERNACCHI.  1. The aim of the Italian Law is to provide, with the assistanpe of  theState,  complete,  uniform  and  permanent  help for  all disabled soldiers..This result  is being  obtained thanks to the  &quot; Oeuvre  nationale pour laprotection et 1&apos;assistance aux invalides de guerre&quot;.  (National Committee-for  the Protection  and Help  of Disabled Soldiers). .          ,  2. The Committee  has its  headquarters  in  Rome and  is  administeredby  a Council of nineteen  members.  Among these are:      (a) Two deputies  and   two senators,   elected  respectively  by  the          Chamber of Deputies and by the Senate;-    (b) Fifteen members nominated by a royal decree after recommenda-          tion  by the President of the Cabinet.           -  These  members  are  individuals   of recognised   administrative  andTechnical  ability,   being  selected from the  Italian  Ministries  of  theInterior, War, Marine,  Finance, Industry,  Commerce  and  Labour; also-from  representatives of various committees  for  providing  assistance  to-disabled soldiers and from public relief and,pension societies.  -  The  council elects  from its members an  executive committee of  sevenpersons to  deal with  all  urgent matters and cany  out  the  suggestions-brought  forward  by the council.  (Article 1.)  3. Article 1 of the Law  applies to all disabled soldiers before and aftertheir  discharge,  and  also to every person who,  owing  to  an accidentincured by  direct  or  indirect war service, has become totally or partiallyunfit for useful work.                                 &apos;   &apos;  The  discharge  papers are  drawn  on the  same  lines as  laid down  inItalian Law relating  to military^ pensions.  If the  person  concerned  be-not a  soldier,  the discharge is given by  a  medical health  commissionconstituted  in  accordance   with  the  rules  laid   down  by  the  Law..(Article  2.)  4. The National  Committee provides:      (a) Medical, orthopaedic and prothetic  assistance for disabled soldiers,.          if this is not already provided by the military authorities, or,.          in cases  where  the need for  such  assistance arises  later;    (ft) Financial  assistance where this is considered - necessary&apos; in certain          special cases;    (c) Social assistance,  either by primary  technical  education or  by          re-education;    (d) Suitable situations for  re-educated  soldiers;    (e) Legal  and  medical help in  all - cases  where  the  disabled soldier          cannot personally protect his own interest;    (/) Every kind of assistance, protection  and  control  in connection          with the rules and  regulations  drawn  up  to  help soldiers.          (Article 3.)  5-. The work of  the  National Committee  depends  on the  co-operationof every public as well  as private  institution, and  especially on the co-operation of  all  committees constituted  for the  protection, technicalre-education and assistance of disabled soldiers.   (Article 4.)  6. The National  Committee co-ordinates  and completes  the work of  the-institutions  mentioned, and has the right to control their actions and toform  provincial and inter-provincial  associations  of the different com-mittees formed to  assist disabled soldiers.   lArticlw 6A
   7.  Discharged soldiers will  be allowed to continue their service in the rarmy or their  work in public  or private  employment  provided that the official doctor declares them to be fit to go back to work.   In the event of disagreement, the matter  will be referred to a doctor belonging  to  and appointed by  the National Committee.   Discharged men have the right to be given work within a year of the war.   (Articles 6, 7 and 8.)   8.  The Minister  of  the  Interior  will  authorise  in his  annual  budget the disbursement  of a sum  proportionate to the  needs  of a National Committee.  (Article 10.)   9.  When his  medical treatment is  completed,  each discharged man will&quot;be sent for technical  re-education to  a special institute,  where he  will remain  at least a fortnight, provided that he is physically fit or that his social position demands it.   As  a  general rule technical  re-education will not last  more than six months  except in  special  cases which will  be settled by the military authorities.   (Articles  12,  13, 14, 15 and 16.)   10.  The cost of temporary or final &quot; prothetic &quot; apparatus will be borne by the military authorities.   The National Committee&apos;will bear the costs of repairs and  alterations  on  the terms and conditions arranged by their administrative  staff.   (Article 17.)   11.  The Law of March 25th concerning disabled  soldiers  will  not affect their  pensions  whatever be the stage  reached in  their re-education  and the importance of their new  situation.   12.  Disabled  soldiers on pension will be given  financial  assistance by means of  loans and savings  banks, and  by  means of loans  on  landed securities, for buying land or establishing businesses, providing the amount of their pension is given  as a guarantee.  This pension will be accepted as security by  all public  administrative bodies.   13.  Working  men&apos;s  insurance societies are obliged  to  insure  all  dis- abled soldiers  who  have   gone  back  to work  of  any  kind.  An  extra premium will only be  allowed in particular cases in accordance with the regulations of the Law.  (Article 24.)   14.  His  Italian  Majesty&apos;s  Government  has  been  entrusted  with  the-compilation of statistics relating to disabled soldiers.  (Article 24.)                               Conclusion.   15.  Our  analysis of the Italian Law  of March 25th,  1917,  for the pro-tection and assistance of disabled soldiers, expresses  the repayment of thenational debt  of  gratitude and help,  which the country owes to thoseseriously or  permanently disabled while  defending  their Fatherland  andthe highest interests of justice and  humanity.   The physical  and  social  rehabilitation of disabled soldiers effected bymedical  help  and completed by compulsory and permanent  &quot; prothesis,&quot;by refitting  for work  and  by the provision of  work and  the  protectionof  special laws, represents a perfect  and ideal organization  for  socialassistance  and care,  the good effects of which should continue  to be  feltin  peace time  by every disabled worker.(3) A  SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF  THE BELGIAN SCHOOL  OF RE-EDUCATION                            AT PORT VILLEZ.  The  work of establishing a school for the technical training of woundedBelgian  soldiers was started in  July, 1915.  The  scheme was generouslyinspired by Baron  de Broqueville,  Minister of War.  The  Institution,  consisting of  movable wooden  buildings in sections, isbuilt on specially cleared and prepared ground.  From the time it opened
 up to August 1915,  50 wounded men were received, and since then  the work  has expanded continuously.    At present  there  are about  1,300 wounded and disabled  men in the building.   The aim of this  Institution is to  give, a thorough physical,  technical, intellectual and moral  re-education to the severely wounded.   A medical department deals with the examination of injuries and decides what  special treatment  they  demand;  mechanotherapy,  electrotherapy, gymnastics,  (fee, are available  for those wounded men whose condition is considered likely to improve.   The medical department deals with orthopaedic and prothetic apparatus in cases of amputation, and gives advice as to choice of trades.  It super- intends the hospital and deals with matters of hygiene.   A  technical department  supervises the  different  workshops  wherein wounded men are taught a variety  of trades.   The intellectual and moral education of the men is under an educational department, which  deals  with  general instruction, and  arranges  courses for candidates destined to enter any public or private employment, also technical classes for the various trades carried on at Port Villez.   A. military branch  is  concerned with the  supervising  discipline and management of the premises, clothing and stores.   The Institution comprises three large sections.  A  school for commerce, industries and  civil services,  a school  for  trades  and  an agricultural school.   The first school,  which is&quot;a special building, only recently constructed, has 23 classes in its scheme:  a  primary course,  an ordinary course, an administrative  course,  a  course of  commercial  training  and foreign languages, &amp;c.  These are intended chiefly for the men who are unable to learn manual trades,  and  lead  to  various  employments  in public works, export houses, banks, factories, &amp;c.   The school of crafts is housed in sheds  (rows 2 and 3 on the right)  more or less close to the workshops, wherein  different trades  in woodworking, metal-working and leather-working,  tailoring,  hairdressing,  book pro- duction,  different  kinds  of commercial  painting  work,  and various  art trades are carried on.  A third section includes all  facilities  for  giving a  practical education and training in stock-breeding  on  a small  scale,  horticulture and  agri- culture.   This is carried on in the gardens and grounds of the school, and at farm  schools in the vicinity.  Besides a  practical  training,  the  scheme also  includes  courses of  in-struction in two languages, in arithmetic and technology.   These classes  are held in five.blocks of the first row (Nos.- 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).  The  blocks on the left of the  three rows are  used as dormitories for the men.   A  large &quot;hall, with  a terrace,  built near the  slooe  of the hill,  isalways  at their disposal.    It is  used  for  cinematograph  shows  andtheatrical performances twice a week, and  for  other  purposes.  The hallis also used  as  a* dining-hall and canteen.   The kitchens  are under themessroom terrace.  A chaplain has-charge  of the religious services.  One block  (No. 75) isfitted up as  a  chapel.  A commissariat department  is attached  to the Institution,  and  alsosupplies  adjacent departments.   This  section includes a baker&apos;s shop  witha mill exclusively for the school, a pork butcher&apos;s shop, with styes adjoin-ing in which animals are well fattened on kitchen refuse.  There is also abutcher&apos;s shop.  The produce of these different departments, small animalstockbreeding, potatoes, all kinds of vegetables and fruits, and poultry arealso used so as to make the food as varied  as possible.  Washing and disinfection of clothes is done in a large washhouse (No.  1).Close by are  bathrooms (No. 2)  with a number of shower baths.  Lastly,  there is an exhibition and sale room in which is  a collection ofspecimens of work done by members of the Institution.

Zii3/ffllORSHIRS LOCAL COMMITTEE.        Reporting on this Committee tho Inspector states that thereare some signs that the Committee are arousing from their slumbers.Since his last visit they have insisted on S,l, forms being sent inbefore applications are considered.   They pride themselves on thesmall amount of money distributed, but were informed that there wasa possibility of this being a source of danger.   The Committee repliedthat there were no cases of distress in Radnorshire which would notbe dealt with.   There is no register of disabled men.COUDITY Off CARDIGAN LOCAL CCiMTTBB.        Our Inspector reports that very little change has takenplace since his last visit.   The Committee&apos;s staff appears to beexceptionally weak and they have lately lost six men leaving only anelderly man not possessed with sufficient energy to satisfactorily workthe regulations.   The question of appointing an official who canundertake the secretarial duties and also those of Pensions EnquiryOfficer is being considered.        Nothing has been done with the Disablement question exceptthat at a recent Meeting six district areas were founded, the membersof which were asked to get into contact  with the discharged men.About 100 men have been discharged and it is understood that most ofthem are working on farms.   Facilities will be available for suitablecases at the Aberystwyth Training Colleges.,COTOTY OF BRECON LQOaL COLMITTEE.        This Committee was visited by our Inspector on the- 16th ofJuly who reports that it is one of the best of the smaller counties.Breconshire is one of the counties in the South Wales combination, fortreatment of disabled men.   Pending developments they are doingwhat they can for the men, but complain that there are no ConvalescentHomos available.   There are five or six bad oases on the waiting list.        Brynmaur on the borders of Monmouthshire is the only trouble-some spot in this Local Committee&apos;s area, but organization hasimproved ahd they now deal more satisfactorily with cases.        Owing to the transfer of the Health and Training Sectionof the Disablements Branch, there are no reports under these headings,as it is understood they are reporting direct to the PensionsMinistry.        The Alternative Pensions Branch was started on Monday last,the 23rd instant by the transfer to the Duke of York&apos;s School of&quot;Ir.

Training;  and  Trade^nions.T HAVE been  reading a useful little pamphletJL  addressed to disabled sailors and soldiers and   containing a few notes on the advantages ofiraining for their future career. It speaks of the promises that have been made asto pensions and&apos;allowances and goes to show thatiho.se  promises have been,  or  are now  being,fulfilled.   I am afraid I cannot go so far as to saywith the writer that more  than was-promised hadbeen given, although  I agree that the conditionsunder  which disabled  sailors and soldiers are nowtreated are much  better than they ever werebefore. This&quot; is not saying much, however, for onemust  remember in  this connection  that  theprevious state of things was far worse than ever itshould have been.  One thing that must certainlybe. assured to every disabled man is that anadequate  pension shall be granted to hirn  andnothing shall happen to reduce it.  Uncertaintyon this point I am afraid  has disheartened manymen on returning disabled from the Colours. During this war more than iii  any other theArmy has been made  up of civilians  who arefighting for the sake of their country and as theyare passed out of  military service, having donetheir bit, they revert back to their civilian pursuits.But  in cases where disablement has  intervened,they find themselves in the position they were inwhen starting life  with the  handicap that  dis-ablement imposes,  -and  so  a new  life begins,and  the  man  must  say to himself, as wouldhave been said for  him on his original entry intothe industrial world, &quot; What is the best  thing forme to do %  Before the war I had a trade or pro-fession.  I had  made myself expert in certaindirections and was  able to get a good living andnow I feel that I am stranded.&quot;  Knowing that Iam speaking to  brave men I say:   Is that  so ?Tou did it once, is there not just a chance that youcan do it again ?  If you were willing  to makesacrifices for your fellows, surely One  more effortfor yourself is not beyond  you ?  I am sayingthis to you because I know the kind of  man youare, and, therefore, please let me add :  There is nonecessity to remind you of your duty to the State,but there is a danger that you will forget yoiu dutyto,, yourself.   The most important step  is to  goback to your Trade Union.  If you  were not insuch, an organisation before  the war,  join  onenow.  Your future  welfare will depend so largelyupon the action taken by employers and workmenin organised form  in  all labour matters.  Youmust be kept out of the hands of the  sweaters atall costs, and whilst the Trade Unions will&apos;doeverything in their power to  protect you in thisway,  you yourself must be willing  to help.Eemember you are not a soldier. The  war,willsoon be  over.   The life before you is that of acivilian.   The  cheers of the people will die away,and unless you look out you will be one of thecrowd.  Being crippled and untrained will mean aprecarious and very uncertain future,  but on theother hand,  having discovered the best means ofobtaining a future livelihood and having receivedthe training which is now  offered to  you and
 which will make you competent, there is hope for a much brighter time.                         %   And so I come back to the pamphlet.   It says &quot; Many of the Trade Unions are ready to welcome you.&quot;  That I know to be true.   &quot; The Employers&apos; Associations are offering to  employ you.&quot;   That I know  is  also  correct.   &quot; Willing   helpers   are waiting to teach you, and the nation is willing to support you during training.&quot;  You had sufficient grit to  come forward to help your country ;  that same pluck  and determination which  has  carried you through the hardships of war and has helped you to  bear  your disablement, will now be  neededfor one further great effort.   Everybody agrees youhave done your  duty to everybody  round you.Accept the  offers now  made to you to  receivetraining which will enable you to keep your end upvery much  better than  you could otherwise do.You have proved yourself efficient right through,do not fail in the last test.

Monthly  Notes.                     -o-   At the time of going to press, the Bill providing for the transfer of the powers of the Statutory Committee                 lias passed its thud reading in the  Naval and Mili- House of Commons.  tary War Pen-    Briefly  it  provides  for the  dis- sions, Transfer of solution of the Statutory Committee    Powers Bill,   the transfer of- treatment and training                 to the Ministry and for the setting up of a &quot; Special Grants Committee &quot; within the Ministry to  which shall  lie  transferred  those functions, of the Statutory Committee specified in paragraphs  (a), (b), (f), (g) and (h) of sub-section  (1) of Section 3 of the principal Act.  With this Special Grants Committee also will rest the responsibility for determining the amount of any grant or allowance  to be made tinder paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (k).  This  body will be independent of  the  Minister in making its awards, but dual control will be  avoided, as the Pensions  Ministry will act as its executive.  After the day  fixed for the transfer,  Local Committees Will, therefore, correspond with one body only, the Ministry of Pensions.                    -O-    . &apos;  The Ministry  of  Labour,  in  collaboration with  the War Pensions, &amp;c., Statutory Committee, is publishing                 a  series  of  Reports  upon Openings    Industrial    in Industry for Disabled Men.  These   Openings for   Reports contain suggestions as to the  Disabled Men.  length and methods of training and as                 to the possible openings for disabled men who have been trained, and  they-  have  beenapproved before  publication  by the Trade AdvisoryCommittee (Disabled  Sailors and Soldiers) in those trades where such  Committees exist.  The  Trade A visory Conrmittees consist of an equal number of repj sentatives  nominated respectively&quot; by Associations Employers and Workpeople.   The  following Repo; have so far appeared.  No. 1, Electricity Sub-Stati Attendants ;  No. 2, Picture Theatres, including Ch matograph Operating ;  No. 3, Tailoring (Retail Bt poke).

Copies are obtainable from the Stationery Office at t price of 2d. each.   The rates for the highest degree  of disablement a more  favourable than the present rates for all rani Space will  not  permit any  detailed comment at it stage.  It will, however, be noticed that the principle &quot; alternative pensions &quot; is extended to officers.   Where a disabled officer can shew that his retired-pa and wound pension  (if  any) are  such that, with l remaining earning  capacity, he cannot attain  to t pre-war earnings, an alternative pension may be  givt him to make up the deficiency, subject to a maxiinu of  300 per annum, plus one half of any pre-war earnin between  300 and  GOO a year.                     -o-   The instructions for the Administration of Treatmei and Training,  for which provision is made in Article                 of the new  Royal Warrant,  have no  Instructions for been issued by the Minister of Pensioi  Treatment and  to all Committees.  They are designe     Training.     to set out in a clear form the procedia                 to be adopted in any case which coini before a Committee and the notes appended to them giv a detailed account both of the  more important class of case in which special treatment will have to be givt and of the principles upon which training in civil emploj ment should be provided.  As regards treatment, the Minister has been impress with the necessity of providing Local Committees wit better expert advice  and guidance than many of  the: have hitherto  had  and  the  appointing of  Medici Referees for  specific areas will  be found to be of conside able service to Local  Committees.  In  the presei depleted state of the medical profession it will no doul not be an easy matter to secure the necessary number i qualified medical men to act as referees but arrangemenwill be pushed on as rapidl y as is possible.  An importaifeature of the  arrangements which the Minister has i
/247AUGUST,  1917.THE  WAR  PENSIONS GAZETTE.,35 ontemplation, is the provision of fresh institutions for those special  classes  of  case,  some of  which,  like Neurasthenics, are almost exclusively a  direct product -f the present war, and for whom, pro vision is now being jiade by the Joint Institutional  Committee  of  the Ministry and the  Red Cross Society both of  England and Scotland.  The   new  Joint  Disablement  Committees which have  now been formed  in most parts  of  the Kingdom can render valuable assistance in determining the needs of their own areas for those special classes and in bringing their information to the  attention of  the Minister.  In regard to training, Local Committees should  pay special attention  to the remarks appended in the Notes to the Instructions on the principles which should guide them in selecting men to be  trained and in concerting arrangements for  their training with the Local Education Authorities or with employers of labour.  Training of the disabled men for  industrial employment is the first step in the work of Reconstruction which must succeed the present war and  Local Committees should realise that their own work  in this  direction must,  if it is to be ffectual,  be  carried out on systematic lines and with expert assistance.   At the present time, slightly disabled men are very readily able to obtain employment,  but such employment  is often not the best suited to them and may not be likely to offer a chance of permanent liveli- lood, and such men will, if they cannot  be induced to take up training now, come to their Local  Committee for training later on and  it  is  all important tha^  the machinery for training should be thought out in advance against the demand that is  bound to come.   In this sphere too, a Joint Committee can render valuable help to the Local  Committees  in its area by  surveying  theground and making arrangements with the Local Educa-tion  Authorities which the Local Committees will beable to utilise.                                 8  It should be noted that all fresh cases requiring treat-mcnt or training after the 23rd instant will be dealt withunder  these Instructions.  The  Statutory&apos; Committeeare themselves issuing  a circular to  Local  Committees efming the position in regard to their own Regulations.  In Austria the care of the disabled soldier is organisedby the State, and the line of demarcation of the respon-ibilities of the Military and Civil authorities is clearlydefined.  The Army administration alone is responsible for thecomplete medical treatment and for the provision ofartificial limbs.  The two authorities must co-operate in convalescenttreatment, and in training, which will be carried out bythe  Army  administration,  so  far as possible, in  theinstitutions at its disposal. &apos;. It will also arrange for thedisciplinary supervision of those persons who are trainingin non-military establishments.  &quot;  The State administration will place at the disposal ofthe Army its technical resources and institutions.  Thecivil authority is responsible for finding work. Relatives  Visiting Men  in  Hospitals.              Y.M.C.A.  ARRANGEMENTS.       1. HOSPITALS IN  THE UNITED  KINGDOM.   On receiving an application from the relative, the War Pensions Local  Committee should write or wire  to the Y.M.C.A. in the town where the  soldier is in hospital, giving full particulars, i.e., stating what train the relative will arrive by, whether accommodation is,needed, etc. Wherever possible the Y.M.C.A. will make arrangements to meet and secure the comfort of  visitors.               2. HOSPITALS, LONDON.  The Local Committee should communicate with the Y.M.C.A. Headquarters, Tottenham Court Road, W., giving particulars as above, when the relative will be met and taken to the hospital, and to  the Association^ Hostel for the night, if necessary.              3. HOSPITALS IN FRANCE.   &apos;  The Local  Committee  may communicate  with the Y.M.C.A. Headquarters, but this is not essential  as the Association have  arranged to  meet the boats,  at^ all ports and to take charge of relatives, sending them to the town and hospital required, and providing accommoda- tion, food, etc.  The organisation of the  Y.M.C.A. in France is verythorough, and is recognised by our Government.           Pensions  in Germany.   In Germany  there  are  apparently three classes  ofpensions provided by the State, viz.   (a) A pension on account of injury received on service,whether as the result of a wound, an accident, or throughillness contracted on service, amounting to 540 marks perannum  for a private soldier rising to 900  marks for aSergeant-Major.   (6) A pension on account of mutilation, independentof rank, amounting to 648  marks per annum for totalblindness and 324 marks per annum for other mutilations.   (c) A&apos;pension for injury received while on  activeservice  (presumably in  action) of 180 marks a year.   The amount of this last form  of pension, known asthe &quot; War Addition &quot; is liable to be diminished or with-drawn  in  consequence  of  greatly  increased  earningcapacity,  but it will  be  paid so long  as the personauthorised to receive it is affected to a measurable degreein his powers of  earning.   On the  other  hand a  change in  the certificate ofmutilation is excluded by regulation.   A private soldier, totally blinded in action would,therefore, receive a pension of 540+648 + 180=1,368marks per annum, say 26s. per week,  compared with27s. 6d. mider the Royal Warrant in this Country.   On the other  hand there  appear to be no provisionsfor childrens&apos; or attendants&apos; allowances, neither does anyother form of  disability rank with total blindness, andwith this one exception the maximum pension that  canbe given drops immediately by 6s. to a pre-war equivalentof  1 per week.
    The  Future of  the  Voluntary                    Worker.                     --o-  The War Pensions Act contains a germ of developmentwhich has not as yet perhaps received as much attentionas the more pressing and urgent problems of the actualneeds, at the moment, of the discharged soldier and thedependants of those that have been killed.  The gradual  evolution from the entirely voluntaryorganisations which sprang up spontaneously at  theoutbreak of war in every  city and village of the country,chiefly in connection with the  S. and S.P.A.  and  theNational Relief Fund, will be an interesting study to thestudent of social organisation who in the next generationwill have gained the right perspective through the passageof time. But at the moment the practical  problem iswhat  is  the relationship of the voluntary and the  officialelements and how far will the existing  organisationsof voluntary workers  continue  to infuse  the  Statemachine with  the elements of  individual sympathyand  consideration.  To avoid  any possibility of  mis-conception, there is  no  suggestion that officials  arelacking  in  these qualities, but that by the very  natureof their duties, the administration of public money underregulations necessarily- complicated and numerous, theycannot give the close personal attention to the needs ofevery individual, that a volunteer has the time to give.Without exception, all  those  officials  with  whom  thewriter has had the pleasure of co-operating, are inspiredby exactly the  same motives as any voluntary workersof rendering  to the  utmost of  their ability  the  fullestnational service.  There have  been  two main ideas concerning  theorganisation  of  social   activities.  First,  a  nationalorganisation for a specific purpose, represented originallyby the S. and S.F.A., then by the Statutory Committee,and now by the Ministry ef Pensions.   Second, a localorganisation with a general purpose, represented by theLocal Representative Committees of the National ReliefFund, which dealt with  all kinds of distress and needarising out of the war.   This general purpose survivesnow in the minds of the voluntary workers.  The LocalWar Pension Committees with  their staff of voluntaryworkers  organised in many various  methods, are  atpresent  the meeting ground of  these two ideas, and thefuture of the pensions system of the country dependson the  relationship which is adopted. There was  atone time a fear  that when the  State took over  theresponsibility for pensions and allowances the volunteerwould be crowded out.  Experience is proving that thevolunteer is essential to  the smooth administration ofthe Act.  The  greater and more subtle danger is thatthe volunteer, whose sympathies are of necessity widerthan the strictly defined functions  and regulations ofthe Local War  Pension Committee, may in time  be ledto take  up other work which may appear more urgentand necessary.  For example, after the war,  none of us can remainindifferent  to the fate of  men who may not be entitledto pension, or who have not suffered physical dama?through their military  or naval  service, and yet niabe dealt with by some organisation under the Ministof Labour or the Board of Trade.  As workers under t1War Pensions Act we shall have no authority or opptunity to deal with them.  The inevitable conclusionthat the organisation of voluntary work  must  beelastic and adaptable as the sympathies of the individ&quot;workers.  The War Pensions Committees are the nucleiround which have gathered the  keenest and the mointelligent volunteers in each district.   What will theattitude be to the problems of the future ?   Out  of the writer&apos;s  experience, limited to a  lartindustrial city in the North, I would venture to sugpt-that the present need  is information as to the soc!organisation of  the  country,  Poor  Law,  EducatioPublic Health, the Law Courts, National Insurance, ttThere is little demand for theoretical discussion of fufuneeds,  but  a great  demand for information on 1!detailed working of the machinery of national and lotGovernment.  The pamphlet &quot;of the Joint Cominitton Social  Service,  containing  such information a&apos;kindly  noticed in the  &quot; War  Pensions Gazette,&quot; balready had a circulation of over 10,000.   To obta:adequate assistance for  a soldier&apos;s wife who contracconsumption requires a knowledge of  Public Heal;Administration  and  the National -Insurance  Act.rent difficulty needs knowledge of the Courts EmergesPowers and Rent Restriction Acts.  The educationa  widow&apos;s  children requires information on the whosystem of Education, Primary, Secondary, ContinuatioTechnical,  and  even University.  If we realise  to 11full our responsibilities and equally our opportunitythe machinery which we are now called upon to wo:may be the greatest force for social improvement tLthe country has yet known.   Alhthese dreams of the future,  however, depend up,the use that we make of the very real present.  I won&apos;urge  upon those responsible for the  &quot; War PensionGazette &quot; the importance of slightly widening the sco:of their articles,  and providing us, their grateful sirscribers, with information by  experts  on the varioractivities to the official and volunteer which affect 1lives  of those whom we are privileged to serve.  Ntsterile discussions of controversial political or econoratheories, but rather information for practical use giveby those who have the specialised knowledge, which conly be gained by experience of detailed administrate   An account of Poor  Law Relief by a Clerk to t&apos;Guardians, or preferably a Relieving.Officer, a descriition of Health Insurance difficulties by an InsurantInspector, of Public Health Administration by a MedicOfficer of Health, written from the point of view ofpossible applicant, would.be helpful, and would enaKus not only to perform more thoroughly and wortliilthe work we  have undertaken  but would  ensure tpermanence of the existing  happy co-ordination of ttofficial  and   voluntary elements   engaged   in  tladministration of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Charter.

1\J71AThe    Weakest    Link. &apos;]3y bis outspoken  words in our  July  number,  Mr.lUlswcrthy has  placed the  whole community in hisIjebt.  He has laid  his finger upon  the weakest linkJL the chain of provisions the country is making for theIjisabled man.  It remain  for every one of us, fromlie Minister downwards, to back up this appeal and[o concentrate his energy upon the overcoming  of thisIveakness.  ,  We hear a great deall)  the  &quot; provision oflacilities&quot;  for  treat-nent  and   training,jut    without    thenaterial  these   arenorely empty words. It is no use  blinkinghe fact that the num-ifrs coming. in to berained   are   disap-jointingly smaU. The Local Commit-ecs  have been  quicko realise  that it isiot enough to sit  stillnd  wait for  the in-llux  of  eager candi-lates, who  never ar-live. In our first numberLeicester told us thatt was   necessary to:go out into the high-(rays and byeways andjornpel  them to comeDI SAB LED     SAILO RS     AND     SOLDIERSWHAT EVERY  MAN SHOULD  KNOWTHAT he  can  get  the fullest    information as to what can    be done for him from his    War Pensions Local Com-  - mittee.THAT the  address of the Com-    mittee  can  be  obtained at    the Post Office  nearest his    home.THAT the  War Pensions Local    Committee are not distribu-    ting  charitable  funds,  but    funds  provided   by   the    State.THAT every  man  disabled  by    War Service has a right to    a pension or gratuity.THAT he has a right to the most    careful and effective treat-    ment obtainable.THAT if he requires an artificial    limb, it will be supplied and    maintained  in  good order    free of charge.THAT if his disability prevents    him  from  returning to his    old trade  he will  receive    free  training for  a  new    one.THAT HE  MUST  TELL  HIS    HE  WANTS. There  still remainsn unfortunate ignor-nce in the minds ofiischarged  men as tohat can be done forhem.  The  Ministryealises this, and pur-IOSOS  to - do all  thatan be done  centrallyo dispel  it. Shortly  after  thisnonth&apos;s  paper  appears,  the  railway  stations  andloardings throughout the country  should be decoratedttth their first poster, reproduced on this page.I This is only a beginning.  When the man has learnedMiere to  go, and what to do, the greater task remains totcrsuade him to do it.I All experience goes to show that the personal appealilone has any real effect, an appeal, as Mr. Galsworthylys, to  the &quot;grim reality &quot; of peace conditions,  that-iture time when everyone will be  anxious  to thrustut of Ins mind the memories of the war.   This appealshould  begin in  the  hospital.  It  is  there possiblythat conditions are most favourable.  Lying in bed  the man has  had plenty  of time forreflection.   He is sick  of hospital routine, and if he isto become a valued national asset insteadof a seriousmenace, occupation  must  be provided for mind andbody.  Often he has no idea in  his  mind of what  he can do                                after the  war, and a                                short  talk  helps  to                                decided  the problem,                                and  to  encourage him                                to start building plans                                for his future.

Variation is an inseparable characteristic of all livingorganisms.  It is, therefore, to be expected that humanorganisations created for identical purposes  should, ifthey are in any sense living, exhibit variety either ofform  or method.  Perhaps,  therefore, it may not  bemerely  &quot; vain repetition &quot; to give an account of theconstitution and working  of the  Citizens&apos;  Committeein Birmingham.  On the outbreak of War, the Citizens&apos; Committee wasformed  to  aclminister the Prince of Wales&apos; Fund; andthe City Aid Society, which was the largest relief societyin the City, placed at the disposal  of the. Citizens&apos; Com-mittee its organisation, which was  then augmented andextended:  With the object of avoiding overlapping,the policy of co-ordination was adopted from the outset,and step by step the Citizens&apos; Committee  absorbed mostof the voluntary agencies concerned with the relief ofcases both  military and civil; so that at the end of  1915it had not only brought &quot;about an amalgamation  withthe City Aid Society, Charity Organisation Society andHandsworth Aid Society, but acted as the local repre-sentative of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families&apos; Associa-tion, Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Help Society, Royal PatrioticFund Corporation, and the Government  Committee forthe Prevention and Relief of  Distress.  In this way theCitizens&apos; Committee became responsible for the care, notonly of  the dependants of soldiers and sailors and of themen themselves, but also of  the civilians who were indistress either in consequence of the War, or from othercauses (such as illness, etc.) unconnected with the war.  After the passing of the  Naval and  Military  WarPensions Act, the various voluntary agencies which hadamalgamated with the Citizens&apos; Committee decided toform a  Society to be known as the  Citizens&apos; Society,and this was duly incorporated by  Licence of the Boardof Trade on the 9th August, 1916.  The scheme for the  constitution of  the  Local Com-mittee under the Act, allowed for a representation from theCitizens&apos; Society, of 13 members out of the  31, and thisSociety  in  its turn consented to place  the whole of itsorganisation at the disposal of the Local Committee to be known as the Citizens&apos; Committee for a periodof three years and to accept the Citizens&apos;- Committee asits executive.  It is  only natural that a  Committee which has de-veloped from a purely  voluntary  organisation  shouldattach special importance  to the  personal side of thework and should endeavour to avoid as far as possiblethe spirit  of officialdom.  The   organisation of   theCitizens&apos; Committee is based  on the principle  of decen-tralisation, the work being distributed among twenty-nine district committees of varying geographical area.In this way the cases are dealt with by persons who arefamiliar with local conditions and who  are able to  dealwith them  in an individual and understanding manner.  The difficulties of decentralisation, especially in  con-AUGUST, 1917.nection with securing uniformity of treatment, are toewell known to need comment.  In the opinion of thiCommittee, however, the advantages largely outweigthe disadvantages, and it may be of interest briefly toutline the steps that have been taken to minimise suedifficulties as are inevitable.  The District Committees consist each of 20 membersfour-fifths of  whom were  elected in the  first instanciat a meeting of the members and visitors of the originsDistrict  Committees, with representatives  of all tinprominent organisations engaged in public work in tindistrict, the remaining one-fifth being appointed by thiCitizens&apos;  Committee.  The members  elect  their o\nofficers (subject only to sanction by the Citizens&apos; Committee), with the exception of the Honorary Accountantwho is appointed by the Citizens&apos; Committee.  All the applicants are advised in the first instance tapply to the district office.  Here the record is taken, amthe case is then handed to a visitor (who may or may no:be a member of the Committee), to obtain any furllicparticulars that are required and to visit the home ammake personal observations as to  the home conditionEmployers&apos; and medical forms are sent  out from th-district office and the case is considered by the Committee which meets weekly.  The success or failure of the work depends on th.extent to which these Committees can attract the mostcapable workers of the  locality and can keep alive thenthusiasm and interest of then.1 members and visitorsThe ideal district  office is one to  which the applicantcome to  unburden themselves of  all their difficultiesand one where they feel sure of a welcome and friend!;interest.  The number of  cases dealt with by each Cominittevaries very much, but in some of the most thickly populated districts it may amount to over 200 cases a week.  The applicants  receive  their grants  at  the districoffice.   After  each Committee meeting, tickets are dc-livered to the applicants by the visitors, a schedule of tingrants made is sent to the Head Office, and  the amoralrequired is sent down at the allotted time by a pay clerkwho makes the actual  payments, obtains the receipt;and  brings them to the Head Office.&quot; Each Committeehowever,  has  a certain amount of petty  cash to  nice!emergency cases, and its accounts are checked monthlyby the Honorary Accountant.  Uniformity between the District Committees is securedthrough the six Divisional Committees, each of whiciconsists of one representative  of  each of the DistrictCommittees comprised in their division (4-7), and fourmembers appointed by the Citizens&apos; Committee, two olwhom at least, exclusive of the Chairman, are members oithat Committee.  The Chairman is elected annually bythe members of the District Committees, and is ex-officica member of the Citizens&apos; Committee, so that the DistrictCommittees have direct representation on the CitizensCommittee.  The  Divisional Committees meet weekly at the HeadOffice and review  all cases dealt with by the DistrictCommittees within six weeks of the first grants, and at
 uch further periods as they may determine ; deal with jll cases of difficulty referred to them; and alone have Hie power of making recommendations to the Statutory ommittee for those special  grants under Part II.  of qo Regulations which  require the sanction  of that body.  They  also interview the applicants and  make ^commendations under  Part  I. of the Regulations, though these have so far been submitted to the Appeals Sub-Committee before being  sent xip to London.  The Divisional Committees have proved of great value.  The opportunity of understanding the reasons for the refusal of grants, where such is necessary, reduces to a minimum the feeling that must almost inevitably exist between the Committee which is personally interested in a case and the Central Controlling Committee, whose duty it is  to safeguard the public funds entrusted to  them  and  to see that the Regulations are loyally adhered to..  In addition to the District and Divisional Committees, there is a special case Sub-Committee of the Adminis- tration Committee, known as the Appeals, which  co- ordinates the work of the six Divisional Committees in  the same  way  as the  Divisional Committees  co- ordinate  the  work of the District Committees.  The Appeals Sub-Committee  consists mainly of members of the  Administration Committee, including  the six Divi- sional chairmen, and a  certain  number  of co-opted members,  and deals  with cases  of principle,  appeals from District  Committees against the  decision of the Divisionals, cases under Part I. of the Regulations, and various types  of special  cases  which are  dealt  with  at the Head Office direct. The criticism may be raised that the machinery is unnecessarily  cumbrous.  It may  be  that  it  will  be found possible in the future to simplify the organisation, hit in the meantime it acts as a safeguard and  ensures lull consideration for each case. The provision of special medical  treatment either at ospitals  or  convalescent  homes,  both  for  depen- lents and for  discharged  men, is dealt  with  by the Vppeals Sub-Committee, as is also the provision  for the are of those children of our soldiers and  sailors who ave  been . deprived, either through  death  or  other uises,  of their  natural  guardians.  The  training of lischarged men is also centralised and will be referred o later.  A special department at the Head Office  is levoted  to the  recovery  from  the  Paymasters  of dvances  made by  the District  Committees.  Certain rants, such as funeral grants, necessitating sometimes mergency arrangements, are also  dealt  with  at the lead Office.  For  obvious  reasons again,  cases  of isconduct on the part of soldiers&apos; wives, or cruelty to lildren (needing special investigation and co-operation . ith the police  or  the  National Society  for the revention of Cruelty to Children) are also centralised. The  Citizens&apos;  Committee exercises general controlhrough its  standing Committees, of which there areour  at  the Head Office, viz.,  General  Purposes,  Ad- linistration, Discharged Soldiers,  and Finance,  andlieir various Sub-Committees. The Citizens&apos; Committee at the&apos; first were of opinion that the discharged men might resent  personal inter- ference and  acted  on this assumption.   Experience, however, has convinced them that the personal appeal is the  only one which  is successful and not only  does each man receive a personal letter from the Committee on his return home, but this letter is followed up by a visit from a member of one of the District Committees. When  it is remembered that about 130 discharges are notified each month, it will be realised that this involves a special effort on the part of the District Committees, particularly as sq, much depends  on selecting the right visitor for the right man, and on sending one who being familiar with man&apos;s circumstances and, if possible, his former employment, can advise him as to his future  with the knowledge which comes of experience.^  On the whole the introduction of the personal influence has well repaid the  expenditure of effort, and has bad marked  results in  the considerable increase  in  the number of men who have applied for  treatment and training.   Advice as to training is dealt with at the Head Office by a rota of members  of the Discharged Soldiers&apos; Com- mittee.  These attend twice a week and are assisted by representatives  of  the District Committees  and  also by  employers  and representatives of labour who have offered their services to the  Committee.  The majority of men receive their training  at one or  other of  the Technical Schools in the City, whose resources are being taxed to the utmost.   As  regards medical  treatment, Birmingham  is in a peculiarly fortunate position.  It not only possesses a number of special civil hospitals, but also many military hospitals, all of which  are freely placed at the disposal of the Committee ; an d it is possible therefore to provide all the special out-patient treatment which is required. The various  City  Sanatoria are  able to  provide  the necessary   accommodation  for  those  suffering4 from tuberculosis, while the  existence of a large colony for epileptics  solves a  problem which  possibly presents peculiar difficulties elsewhere.   Even with all these facilities,  however, there  still appears to be a need  for  further provision for cases, mostly of  a medical   nature,   requiring  institutional treatment of a more or less prolonged character,  and steps are being taken to start a home for the purpose in the near future.   This, in brief outline, is the form in which the Citizens&apos; Committee  has  been  evolved.   The  measure  of   its success at present is  the extent to which it is suited to its environment, and its survival and future efficiency will  depend upon the readiness with which it can adaptitself to changing conditions.

The Special Appeal Tribunal under the Qhairmanshipof  His  Honour  Judge  Parry has  commenced  itssittings,  and is  ready to consider  appeals from or onbehalf of men whose  disability has been held by theMinistry of Pensions not to be attributable to service.
The  Treatment  and Training  of  the                    Disabled.                   &apos;  -o-    No. 4.-The Military Orthopsedic Hospital,               Shepherd&apos;s Bush,  W.                     -o-  Orthopaedics may be described as the branch of surgerywhich has for its main object  the restoration of functionand correction of deformity resulting from wounds andaccidents and also&apos;congenital  deformities.  The  Military Orthopsedic Hospital, Shepherd&apos;s Bush,is generally considered to be the headquarters of militaryorthopaedics in the British Isles, and it has been suggestedthat a brief account of its methods and results may proveof interest.  The  various forms of treatment  carried on  in  this (Hospital fall under the following heads, viz. :     (a) Operative treatment.    (6) Electrical treatment.    (c) Massage.    (d) Hydro-therapeutic treatment.    (e) Gymnasium.    (/) Fixation in plaster.    ((/) Splintage.    (h) Curative Manual Treatment in Workshops, etc.  It must, however, be borne in mind that no one of theseforms of treatment is used to the exclusion of others,several  methods  of  treatment being  carried on  con-currently.  The  Hospital  is under the personal supervision  ofColonel Sir Robert Jones, C.B., F.R.C.S., Inspector ofMilitary Orthopaedics, who visits the Hospital every week.The surgical staff is large, and has recently been increasedby  the appointment  of several  American orthopaedicsurgeons.  The uumber of surgical operations performed is  verylarge, sometimes reaching the figure of sixty to  seventyper week, and plans have been prepared for the erectionof a second operating theatre, as the present one hasproved inadequate for the requirements of the Hospital.  Electricity has proved to  be of such service in thestimulation of nerves and muscles, and for the improve-ment of local nutrition,  that  the Electrical Departmentis one  of the most important sections of the Hospital.Several different  methods  of electrical treatment arecarried on in this department, the principal of which arethe stimulation of nerves and muscles by Galvanic andFaradic currents, and the application of heat by meansof a Diathermy apparatus.  Many types of disabilityderive  benefit  from  electrical  treatment peripheralnerve injuries, cases of muscle wasting, functional cases,stiff joints, adherent scars,  trench feet, etc.  The treat-ment  is  carried out by trained  masseuses, who  workunder the direction of the officer in charge of the depart-ment,  Captain  W.  Rowley  Bristow,  F.R.C.S. Thenumber of treatments  now  given daily averages 200,and a number of these are pensioners attending as out-patients.  Massage and carefully supervised exercises also  forma very important item in the treatment of many ortho-paedic cases, and a large massage department is in opwvtion at this Hospital, under the care of Dr. Mennell,who has designed special  apparatus for carrying OK.various beneficial exercises.  The keynote of  treatmor&apos;is that some form of active exercise should be prescribe.at the earliest possible moment, and-shovdd be steadiljprogressive.  The constant tendency is then  to  reducemassage and increase exercise.   The class of cases whielderive benefit in the  massage department vary verymuch.  They comprise cases being prepared  for opera-tion and treatment after operation, cases which requireframing only;  hysterical  deformities, chiefly  of thespasmodic  type, etc.   There are now  about  280 casesattending daily,  many of whom are out-patients.  The hydro-therapeutic department has recently beesbuilt, and has been equipped  with all the latest type;of baths for this form  of  treatment,  which  includewhMpool baths, sedative pool baths, contrast  baths.radiation and Droitwich baths, etc.  A fine new gymnasium has been presented by U.M.King Manuel, and has  been  equipped  with rnoclengymnastic   appliances.  In this  department   specialclasses for each particidar disability are held, and specialbeneficial exercises are performed.  The curative manual workshops form in many way;one  of  the  most interesting sections of the Hospital.In order to relieve the tedium of normal hospital routine,and to  provide a mental environment more favourableto recovery, every patient who is able and willing to doso,  can work at some light and congenial occupatimduring his spare time.   The enforced idleness inseparablefrom the ordinary routine of convalescence in a militaryhospital undoubtedly  tends to make the men lose theiiindustrious ways, and unless some system is adopted tocounteract  this undesirable feature of prolonged period1of hospital life,  the effect may possibly be permanent:and on their return to the  Army or discharge to civi.life the men may find it difficult to again resume theiiformer active ways.  To obviate this, the scheme of cura-tive manual treatment has been introduced, and work-shops have been set up and equipped so that as far a;possible every man can be employed at his old trade.  In addition to the psychological aspect of the schemeanother important feature is that many men can be puton to work which has a direct curative effect upon theirinjured limbs.   As a good instance of this, men sufferingfrom dropped foot or stiff ankles can be put  to work atreadle sewing  machine or treadle fretsaw machine.thus accomplishing by means of  natural movement;results  which  have previously only been attained bysuch uninteresting methods  as pedalling a  dummybicycle.  The following workshops are now at work :   Carpenters&apos; Shop. In this shop  men who were car-penters in civil life are now engaged in that occupati&quot;).under the  supervision of an N.C.O., who is himself apatient and who is a  skilled carpenter.   The men havemade all their own benches, and now make cupboardsscreens, tables,  etc.,  and have recently made  couchesfor  the new  electrical  department.  This occupatio
 affords many excellent opportunities for direct curative manual treatment, for the improvement of stiff elbow joints, weak muscles,  etc.,  for  which the  use  of  the various carpentry tools provides ideal natural exercises.  Boot and Shoemaking. In this shop  the most  im- portant part of the work consists of surgical boot work, to surgeons&apos; orders.  The ordinary repairs to patients&apos; boots are also done in this shop by bootmaker patients.  Tailors&apos; Shop.- Patients who are tailors work in this shop  at alterations and repairs to  patients&apos; clothing. They also  make webbing  straps  for various, splints, and &quot; collar and cuff &quot; slings.  Splint-making. This  industry is probably the most important of all those carried on in the curative work- shops.  Men of several trades smiths, fitters, engineers, leatherworkers, painters, tailors all contribute to this work.  One interesting result  of  the employment of patients in this class of work is that profiting by their own personal experience, they  have in several cases been  able to suggest improvements  in older patterns of splints.   .  Cigarette Making. Owing to the kindness of Messrs. Abdulla &amp; Co., Ltd., in sending an instructor  to  the Hospital, a  number  of patients have acquired the art of rolling cigarettes, and are now getting quite proficient in that occupation.  Painters, electricians, engineers, ironworkers, plumbers bricklayers,  etc., assist with the upkeep work  of  the Hospital.  A recent notable achievement  of the  en- gineers and fitters is the making of an entire Abbotts Operating Table.  In addition to these skilled trades, other patients are engaged in various occupations all over the Hospital, and there is also a fine orchestra of patients, which can give a really enjoyable performance.  Although for the moment the whole idea of the scheme is essentially &quot; curative,&quot; and there is at present no idea of training men in any skilled occupations, there is noidoubt that the workshops  in orthopaedic hospitals actjp some extent as a bridge between the military and thelivil life, especially in the case of men who will not again be fit for the Army.  There are  at the present moment sixty-three  discharged soldiers,  who  are  receiving in- ipatient treatment at  this  Hospital, and when their reatment is finished they will, of course, have a much better chance of earning a good  living,  even  if their  ability is not entirely removeM.  When they leave the hospital, should  they  still  require  further treatment, Jhey  can attend here  or  at some  other  orthopaedic centre as out-patients.  There  is now an average of 130 out-patients attending at this Hospital each week, many of whom are pensioners.  Another important method of treatment is by splint- ge.  A proportion of the cases are treated by means of laster  of Paris  splints, and plaster is  often used in addition to metal splints. It is  frequently essential for  limb to be kept absolutely motionless (as in bone- rafting cases), and to accomplish this the limb is often ntirely encased in plaster.   In the majority of cases, lowever, metal and leather splints of various types areused, which are almost all made in the curative work-&quot;shops by the patients themselves.   In the case of themore elaborate  splints, a plaster cast is taken of thelimb, and the splint is built up  on this, thus ensuringan accurate fit.  The making  of  X-ray  photographs is  of extremeimportance  in the  accurate  diagnosis of orthopaediccases, and there is,  of course, a well equipped X-rayDepartment in this Hospital.  The above brief description gives a little idea of thegreat variety of work carried on in the Hospital.  It wasfirst taken over from  the Hammersmith Guardians bythe military authorities in March, 1916, and in the firstyear of working 1,350 orthopaedic  cases were treatedand discharged, from  Hospital, of which  only 353  (or26  per  cent.) were  discharged  as  permanently  unfit.Taking into consideration the fact that a large numberof the cases were sent to this Hospital as almost hopeless,the above result is -remarkable good.

Nicholson asked the Financial Secretary to the War Office whether, when&apos;allotment is made by a soldier on enlistment or mobilisation, the amount of that allot- ment, when deducted from the soldier&apos;s pay,  should be remitted to the payee as from the date of the allotment ; and  whether, if allowance is  claimed  on behalf  of a dependant, such  allowance with allotment should be issuable from the date of enlistment  or mobilisation or from  the date when allotment is made and  allowance claimed, irrespective of  the delay due to  investigation by the pensions officer ?  &apos;   Mr. Forster :  The  answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  Payment  of&quot;  allowance for a dependant  runs  from the date  of enlistment, provided that the  soldier makes a claim within ten days of  his enlistment.   If the claim is not made within the ten days the allowance is paid as from the date on which the claim is received by his commanding officer.  Mr. MacCallum Scott  asked  the Financial Secretary to  the War  Office whether illegitimate children &quot;are eligible for  increased separation allowance under the Army order issued on 24th January, 1917 ; and, if not, whether they are eligible for an increase of allowance as dependants  under  Statutory  Committee Regulations, Part II., 7  (1) (d),  as amended ?  Mr. Forster  : As regards the first part of the  question, the increased rates apply  whenever separation allowance is admissible.   The second part of the question should be addressed to the Minister of Pensions.  Mr.  Barnes  : The cases  to which the hon.  Member presumably refers  are those in  which separation allow- ances are granted to illegitimate children as dependants under  paragraph 7 (b) of the Regulations.   In such cases the Statutory Committee  would  be prepared to authorise allowances under Part II., Regulation 7 (1) (d).                     Pensions.  Mr. Hogge asked the Pensions Minister whether he can give any information as to the number and type of pension revised up to 30th June ; what class of pension- has yet to be revised ; whether he can make any generalstatement for  the  guidance of  those  concerned  aboutapplications for revision ;  and  whether the  embargo on letters is  now removed ?  Sir  A.  G-riffith-Boscawen:  As regards soldiers, 6,200,life  pensions and 45,317 temporary pensions have beenrevised, the system followed being to revise the latter when  they come up for renewal, except when  the timefor  renewal  is far  off, in which cases the revision is made  in anticipation  of that  time.   In  addition  torevision of  the cases in which pensions were  formerly granted there has been revision  of 3,760 cases in which the claims were rejected.  In 651 of these cases pensions, and in 3,109  gratuities, have  been  awarded.  Withregard to life pensions, it is desirable that applicationfor  re-assessment should  be  made in any case  where it has not been  revised, but  for revision of temporary  pensions no application is necessary.  By public notice  issued in April last, men who had been invalided fror  either Service and whose claims to pension  had.bee:  refused  were  invited to apply for gratuities.  Revisir,  of widows&apos; pensions is completed,  with the  exceptio  of about  100 cases which  have necessitated  furtlv  consideration. Of the  75,000  cases  of  dependant  pensions, 27,000 have been completed, and it is estimate  that the remaining 48,000 will be finished by the end i  October.  The cases are dealt with  in rotation, and n  special group of cases is given priority, except that wht-r  evidence of hardship has  been disclosed the cases  hav  been specially earmarked  for early treatment.    Mr.  Pennefather  asked  the  Minister  of  Pensioi.  whether  a dependant, Class A, may exercise option as t  pension or gratuity ;  whether, if a gratuity is  awarded  any sums paid prior to the award of such  gratuity at  deducted from the amount of that award ;  and what i the rule which governs such deductions ?   Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen :   The decision, where (L Regulations provide for an alternative as to whether pension or gratuity  is to be  awarded, rests with tli Ministry.   In the case of parents, pensions are normal! granted,  but where the dependance was slight, and gratuity appears more beneficial, it is given in lieu of; pension.   Other dependants are only granted  pensioi. if incapable of self-support and in pecuniary need.  1 other circumstances they receive a gratuity under Artie! 22 (2) of the Royal Warrant.   If a gratuity is awarded any sums paid after the normal period for which separa tion allowance is admissible, and pending final decisie on the claim, are deemed to be part of the gratuity.   Mr. Wardle asked the Pensions Minister whether th mother of a soldier who is in receipt of separation allow ance in respect of her husband receives a pension i: respect of her son if he is killed or dies on active service and his death  is due  directly  or indirectly to  militai service  ?                             &apos;   Sir   A.   Griffith-Boscawen:   The  answer  is   i the  affirmative,  provided dependence  on  the  so before mobilisation or enlistment is  established.   Tl. grant of pension in these  cases  is one of the  change introduced by the new Warrant.   Sir G. Toulmin asked the. Pensions  Minister the basi upon which the amount of gratuity  is awarded in tL caso of  dependants of deceased soldiers ; whether ther is a scale of such  awards ; and, if so, will he publis! that scale ? If Mr. Barnes :  The gratuity,  which  is generally  give- only where  the dependant is not qualified for  pensin is limited  by Article 22 (2) of the Royal Warrant to year&apos;s pay of the deceased, or a year&apos;s allowance at 11 rate at  which separation allowance and allotment we:last  payable.   In  most  cases  the  maximum grant i made and no scale has been laid down or is consideic necessary.  Sir G. Toulmin asked  the Pensions Minister, on  tli question of whether  a discharged soldier&apos;s disabilit.has or has not  been caused or aggravated by militar. service,&apos;whether the finding of the Medical Board a
Chelsea, which recommends  the man&apos;s discharge isfinal, or can be subsequently overruled to his detrimentffithout a further physical examination ; and, if so, byjrhoni ?  Sir A.  Griffith-Boscawen:   The   finding  of  theMedical  Boards which form the basis of the awardsof pensions at Chelsea would only be  overruled to the!nan&apos;s detriment by the medical referee on the AdvisoryBoard there in cases where it was found that the MedicalBoard had dealt with the case on incomplete or incorrectinformation.  The finding of the Medical Referee or ofthe Advisory Board can be overruled  by the Minister,but it is most unlikely that this would be done to. the!uan&apos;s detriment. Sir G. Toulmin :  Can the hon. Member say whetherhat revision takes place without  a  further physicalsamination ? Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen :  That depends entirely onhe circumstances.   In many cases,  when  there is aloubt, we order a fresh examination.          Pensions  Appeal  Committee. Mr. Acland Allen asked the Pensions Minister whether; widow of a sailor or soldier will have a right of appeal;o the Pensions Appeal Committee against a decisionjy the Pensions Ministry that the illness which causedhe death of her husband was not due to or aggravatediy the War ? Mr. Barnes:  The functions of the Appeal Tribunal,is submitted  to the Treasury, relate   to  disabledoldiers  and sailors who  liave been granted gratuitiesin the  grounds that their  disablement  was  neitherittributable to nor  aggravated  by military  service,ind  who  claim&apos; pensions.   I  see  no   reason   whyho corresponding  cases  of  widows who are granted;hort pensions  on corresponding  grounds  should not beillowed  access  to the Appeal Court, and I propose tomange for this. The  firm of  Krupps at  Essen  have  undertaken,vherever possible, to  re-instate  all their former em-iloyees disabled by wounds or sickness.   If they cannotake up their  former occupation, lighter work will  berovided.   In  fixing wages, State sources of income areot included. The firm guarantees, in addition to the &quot; War Additionf 180 marks per annum paid by the State, a sum of 15 arks monthly for a period of five years after resumptiont work. If the &quot; War Addition &quot; is removed before this by thelate,  in consequence of increased earning capacity,he  firm will guarantee it from its own funds until thespiration of five years, if the disabled man remains inIheir service, even if he earns the -wage of a completelyfficient workman.; Krupps have also established a curative workshop forhe  disabled, under proper medical supervision, wherejhe  men receive special allowances, and in addition, theustomary rate of wages for all useful work.          Questions and Answers.                   &apos;  -    O     - *         &apos;  , .  .  . Q. 16. What is the &quot; assessed dependence&quot; ichere the allotment and separation allowance is  12s. 6d. or more 1 When the allotment  is  less than 3s.  Qd.,  how  can  the &quot; assessed dependence &quot; be most readily ascertained ?   A.&apos; Where there is one dependant only and separa- tion allowance and allotment amount to 12s. 6d. a week, the assessed dependence may be 12s. 6d. or some higher figure.   It is hoped in such instances that the Pensions Committees will  be prepared  to  give information to Local Committees as to the actual dependence.  When the allotment is known, and is less than 3s. 6d., the table-given in the July issue will enable the assessed depen- dence to be arrived at in most instances.   Q. 17. 7s a wife with children over 16, and none under, a &quot; toife without children &quot; in the sense of 7 (1)  (d) ?  If she is, how far tvould the  earning  power of a daughter, engaged  solely in  the house,  affect the  application of the Regulation 1   A. The Statutory Committee are prepared to con- sider the case of a wife unable to work, who has children over 16 years of age, and none under that age, provided that  separation allowance is not payable in respect of the children, and that they are not earning more than sufficient for their own maintenance.   Q. 18. Can  extra separation allotcance be issued for a child over 14 ?  The child referred to is suffer vngfrom physical infirmity and is thus prevented from earning his living.   A. It is assumed that this  question refers to the possibility of an allowance under Regulation 7 (1) (d). The Statutory Committee have no power to supplement, under that Regulation, the separation allowance payable to the mother and child.  Q.  19. 7s a soldier&apos;s icidow entitled  to any supplemen- tary separation allotcance under Regulation 7 or 13, during the twenty-six iceeks following the soldier&apos;s death, or after that period 1  A. Supplementary separation allowances under Regu- lation 7  may be paid during the period for  which State separation allowance is issued, but cannot be continued beyond that period.   Emergency giants under Regula- tion 13 may be given during the same period, and in certain instances,  where  specially  provided, may  be paid after separation allowance has ceased, e.g.,  sickness grants to a childless widow (13) (a) and grants under 13  (e) if not previously made.  Q.  20. May an allowance be given  in the case of the children  of  a soldier  ichere the wife has been sent to a sanatorium or to a rate-aided institution and her allowance has consequently been stopped ?  There are cases  where it would be impossible to keep  the home together icithout help, say, in the case  of one child who would draw 7s. a  week (motherless allowance) ; a relative having to give up work to come and look after the child until the mother can return home.  The utmost the relative and the child would have to live on would be Is. a week, plus 3s. 6d. allotment, which ivould be  insufficient in many cases.  A. The case  would appear to be met by the addition to Part II.,  Instruction 50.  See Circular No. 34.

Under the neiv Regulation 7 (1) (g), Committees   passed but tlie doctor certifies  that  nourishing  food  are  required to communicate with the Admiralty  before   required during convalescence,  should the  grant  be  co  granting any increased allowance.

The Regulation requires that a sailor shall make   up her abode (admittedly for an indefinite period)  in  an allotment which is not  less  than the maximum of   relative or friends although she still continues to pay  tk  which his  pay admits, and allowances cannot be given  for her permanent address ?  under the  Regulation unless this condition is complied,     A.
