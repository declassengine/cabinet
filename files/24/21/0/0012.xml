             AUSTRIA AMD *3?HE GERMAN CRISIS.     (The  following, dated July 17th,  has been received froma usually  reliable source)t     This  short memorandum is meant to give a summary of theevents in  Berlin as far as they affect Austria and as they areofficially known to Austrian diplomacy.     During his visit to Vienna the German Emperor took noticeof the Austrian desiderata,  without committing himself to anydefinite attitude beyond recognising the necessity of a peace-formula which would establish a certain harmony between theViennese conception of a &quot;war of defence without annexation&quot;and a German statement to the same effect.   At this time theVienna Cabinet had grounds for believing that the question of aresponsible Imperial Government would be supported by Bavaria andassisted by Wurttemberg and Saxony.   After his return to Berlinthe Kaiser made it clear to the Bavarian Minister, Count Lerehenfeld,that a responsible Government for the Empire would mean thecurtailing of the Reservatrechte, the particular privileges of theFederal States.   Count Hertling, who was urgently summoned toBerlin, had to accept a compromise in the form of a parliamentarybody to act as an intermediary between the Feichstag and theImperial Government.  It is incorrect that Count Hertling proposedthis compromise;  but he accepted it as against the otheralternative, which meant the relinquishing of important privileges.He, however, pleaded the acceptance by the Emperor of a clearand unmistakable peace-formula of non-annexation and finallyanswered in the affirmative the Kaiser&apos;s question whether he would
accept the Chancellorship,  if offered to him.   Contrary to news-paper reports,  Court Hertling has never been actually offered theChancellorship;  nor is it true, that he had suggested;the appoint-ment of Dr Michaelis.     It seems that the first progressive attitude of the Centrummajority had &quot;been inspired by the anticipation of a Hertlingregime;  as the Bavarian Prime Minister1 s chances diminished, theBavarian members of the Centre turned round.  They suddenlybecame annexationists^ obviously prompted by the apprehension thatany other Chancellor might not be safely counted upon to fulfilBavarian aspirations to A^ace-Lorraine.   Their attitude is notone of principle hut of party-taotics.     In Austria the official world is confident that Dr Michaelis&apos;appointment is only a temporary one.  He is undoubtedly Hindenburg^candidate;  though Austrians prefer to talk of Luden&amp;orff as theleading spirit, Hindenburg being a mere figure head put in thelimelight to please the people upon whose imagination the FieldMarshal is supposed to have a strong hold.  In Vienna it is supposedthat Dr Michaelis is only expected to keep things quiet till theautumn;  not to undertake any committing action and to try his bestto satisfy the Reichstag parties that everything will be all right.But there is a lurking suspicion at the Ballplatz that undergroundintrigues are at work in Berlin, so as to split the Reichstagmajority with regard to the non-annexation peace-formula.  On theother hand, Viennese intrigues try to prevent the appointment ofCount Brockdorff-Rantzan to the German Foreign Office.  The appoint-ment of Dr Michaelis, who in a private letter is described as a&quot;religious fanatic&quot;, acted as a surprise in Vienna.  In a Ballplatzcommunique, which appeared on the very day of the appointment,Count  Hertling was hailed as the coming man, who would certainlymake a firm  statement as to non-annexation.   On the next datpthe
Viennese press seemed puzzled;   with the exception of theN3ue Freie Presse,  which pretended to be optimistic, the paperswere at a loss what to say;  even the Ballplatz being unable tosuggest any attitude.   The Hungarian press, however, expressed,nearly unanimously, distrust in more Or less polite terms.     For Austria-Hungary the question of the non-annexationformula is of great importance.  Not only because the officialpeople themselves seem seriously to believe that a declarationof non-annexation by the Reichstag would bring peace nearer,but also with regard to the popular feeling which is risingagainst Germany, on the ground that but for German lust ofannexation peace might be cbtained at any moment.  If the GermanReichstag majority refused to propose a resolution or if theImperial Government refused to adhere to it when introduced, the,reaction upon Austro-Hungarian public opinion would be serious:-indeed.  There is,  at present,  scarcely any bsnd that keeps theAllies together;  the relations between the two dynasties areoverstrained;  the armies refuse to consider themselves comradesin arms, and the Slav and Magyar peoples (tho Magyar politiciansexcepted) hate the sight of Germans:  the mere so now, as the earlyagricultural products are being forcibly taken to Germany, whilstthe population of the Austrian and Hungarian towns are reduced toa degreee of starvation such as they have never known during thewar.  As a matter of fact Budapest is now for tho first timeexperiencing the pangs of hunger, and the people know that Germanyis responsible for this.     It is for this reason that I believe that some kind of apeace-formula will bs found in Berlin, that will make itimpossible for Austria and Hungary and restless Bulgaria to express
17.7.17.dissatisfaction.   This,  of course *  will not be a solution.The Austrian and  the Hungarian Parliaments will not sit duringthe suiicaer-,  and this is  a respite which will allow of a certaintranquillity till the autumn.  But  whether there are importantevents on the &quot;battlefields during the summer or not the presentsituation cannot  last over the autumn.  However the chaos ofintrigues finally crystallises, one thing is certain - Austria-Hungary is materially unable to enter on a new winter-campaign.
