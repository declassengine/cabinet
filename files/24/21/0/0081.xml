            From Viceroy, Foreign Department, ,30th July. 1917.  (Repealed to General Officer Commanding Force &quot;D,&quot; and Cox, Baghdad.)               (Received at India Office, 7a.m., 31st July.)   Secret.   Mesopotamia.  Your  telegram of  -11.11  July.   We  trust  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government realises that  these difficulties have  arisen betweenMaude and Cox  simply through Cox&apos;s  desire to  carry out  loyally  andfaithfully  policy  indicated by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.  Events  haveproved immediate carrying out of that policy is impossible :. and we have nohesitation in regarding  Maude&apos;s  arguments (vide  his  telegram 2782 of9th July,  repeated  to  Chief  of  Imperial  General  Staff),  as unanswerable.Until military position in Baghdad Vilayet is completely secured, GeneralOfficer Commanding must  obviously concentrate   on  military  problemsuntrammelled by controversial political  or civil considerations.   We  feelsure Maude appreciates enormous value of Cox&apos;s advice on civil and politicalquestions as much as we  do,  and will be guided  by it  so  far  as militaryposition admits.  But we trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government will agree todrop the proposals put forward in your telegram under reply, so as to leaveMaude free from all extraneous preoccupations, until situation clears.
