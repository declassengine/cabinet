Memorandum (as finally approved).          (Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 199, Minute  1.)    THE true index to the success or failure of the submarine campaign in futurewill be the balance between merchant  ships  sunk and  merchant ships put  intocommission, for the measures we have taken for shortening  voyages, better loading,quicker turning round, confiscation of interned German shipping,  diversion of Alliedand Neutral ships from  coastal or  non-war traffic, and  other methods of makingimproved use of existing resources, which have enabled  us to  keep up  tonnageentrances since  February despite losses,  will soon have had their full effect.    Theeffect of the submarine in restricting the  sea-borne supplies of the  Allies  will then beaccurately shown by the relative figures of loss and gain.   The figures  given in grosstons since February  are as follows: 1917.	British.	Allied and Neutral.	Total.February-March April May June July Total	313,000 342,000 541.000 352,000 396,000 321,000*	219,000 246,000 324,000 242.000 258,000 268,000f	532,000 588,000 865,000 594,000 653.000 579,000	2,264,000	1,547,000	3,811,000* On basis of first 29 days of July. f On basis of losses February to June. In addition, there are a number of vessels damaged by torpedo or mine. For the first six months of 1917 the figures were as follows : 			1917.	British.	Allied and Neutral.	Total.First three months Second three months	194,000 264,000	154,000 158,000	348,000 422,000 ^/    Of these damaged ships, about 50 per cent, may be considered as permanentlyout of commission for the duration of the war, owing to the places in which they arebeached, &amp;c.    The following tables give the actual losses on the basis of the experience of thefirst six months of the unrestricted submarine campaign : 	On basis of February-July 1917.		On basis of May, June, July 1917.		Per month.	Per annum.	Per month.	Per annum.British^ Allied and neutral Total	3S0.OOO 260,000	4,600,000 3,100,000	360,000 250,000	4.300.000 3,000,000	640,000	7,700,000	610,000	7,300,000
    Looking at the position as  a whole,  and taking into  account the  exceptionalcharacter of the April figures and the irrecoverable loss from ships  damaged but notsunk, rthe average totai monthly  losses cannot at present be taken at less  than650,000 tons per month, of which about 500,000 per month is  ocean-going tonnage.    When we come to consider  whether this rate of loss is likely  to rise or fall infuture, the factors are so numerous  and so incalculable that any  estimate must bemore  or less of a guess.  The submarine  war is  a contest in  which both sides arecontinually  improving  their weapons and their methods.    Results, therefore, arebound to fluctuate, and relative  success  and  failure  depend  upon  continuousenergy and resource, not merely upon the sea, but in building and invention on land.    But certain broad facts begin to stand out.  It has never been found practicableto prevent the German submarine from using the many points of entry into the NorthSea, nor, as experience in the Channel and the Dardanelles has shown, has it beenpossible to close the exits therefrom, though the passage is being made steadily  moredangerous.  So long as this remains the case the enemy submarine will not be deprivedof the power of  successful offensive. But there are now nearly 3,000  vessels whose soleduty it is to protect merchant shipping from loss by direct attack or the strewing ofmines.  Our operations have already  forced   them to  rely   almost  entirely onsubmerged  attack by torpedo, but how effective  this wholly hidden attack can beis seen from the fact that during April,  May, and June 75  per  cent,   of themerchantmen sunk  did not  see either the submarine or the periscope before beingstruck.   Further,  there is no  doubt  that  German submarine  resources  areincreasing.  The best opinion considers that they complete two to  three submarinesa week.  It is quite impossible to frame any accurate estimate of their losses.   Theresults of the engagements are most difficult to judge, the certainties being but afraction  of  the probables, the probables of the possibles,  and the possibles of theencounters.   Estimates of their losses from other  sources  than  direct  attack areobviously even less trustworthy.   But the conclusion arrived at  is that the number ofsinkings do not equal the number of new submarines turned out.    On the  other hand, the methods  and instruments for hampering the movementsof the submarines, and for attacking them when  detected, are steadily increasing. Itis extremely likely that the moral of the German submarine service is declining underthe continuous and increasing strain  of the anti-submarine attack.   As regards theprotection of merchantmen, the fact that the  submarines have now to rely  verylargely on  submerged  attack, by  depriving  them  of  their   gun  armament, hasdiminished their efficiency and shortened  the period for which they can remain atsea.   The extension of the convoy system as  more patrol and  escort vessels becomeavailable will also, it is hoped, make successful attack  more difficult.    The winterseason ought also to have the same effect.  Good results have&apos;also followed from thespecial courses  for training  merchant captains  in how to evade submarines and tohandle their ships in the event of an attack.  As many captains  and  mates as possibleare being put through  these courses.   As regards  speed, it.is considered highlydesirable that a sea-going speed  of at least thirteen knots  should be obtained in allnew construction, in order that there  may be  no doubt that  an enemy submarinecannot, when  submerged, overhaul the surface  craft,  and   thereby  get  into  afavourable position for  attack.   It must be borne  in mind that the  submerged speedof the new submarines is constantly increasing,  and it may be taken that at presentthey attain a submerged speed of between  eleven and twelve knots.    To sum up,  it  is obviously impossible  to form anything  approaching  atrustworthy forecast of the future, but so far as an estimate is  of value as a generalguide, it is estimated that the submarine losses will not increase above the  averageof the last three months, though they  will fluctuate, and that they ought to diminish.    This, however, leaves us  confronted  with  a  very  serious position.  The  onlypossible basis upon which we can make our plans for the future is that the recent rateof losses will continue, and this means that they will amount to an average of 650.000tons per month, i.e., 60 per cent. British and 40 per cent. Allied and Neutral.  Howserious this is can be seen by turning to the  probable figures  of new  construction.During the first six  months of 1917 only 485,000 tons of new shipping was launchedfrom  British yards apart from naval  requirements, as against 2,250,000 tons sunk ofBritish shipping alone.  For the second&apos;&apos; half of the year the highest estimate of newconstruction is 1,090,000 tons from British yards, as  against a  loss  to  Britishshipping alone, on the basis of average losses since February of twice as much.   For
next year the programme towards which we are working provides for the construe-tion of commercial shipping at the rate of some 3,000,000 tons per annum, but thisrate of output is dependent on an increase in shipbuilding yards and steel production,and cannot be reached until well towards the end of 1918.  The output during theyear ought  to be  about  2,300,000  tons  if our  plans materialise  as  we hope.This figure involves  the reduction of our naval programme to the absolute  minimum.It is uncertain what further increment will be available from other countries, but theamount which countries other than the U.S.A. can produce is not likely to exceedthe rate of 200,000 tons per annum, mainly owing to the difficulty of obtaining steel.The total contracts  still  to be completed on British account in the U.S.A. amountto 162 vessels of a gross tonnage of 741,000, the bulk of which is for delivery in 1918.     Thus the broad conclusion is that for the last six  months of 1917 we can onlysee our way to an average output from British yards of  180,000 tons per month, andfor 1918  of 200,000  tons per month (though towards the end of the year the outputwill, we  hope, have reached 250,000  tons per month),  with a possible addition of20,000  tons  per month from countries other than the  U.S.A., while  the  averagemonthly loss on the basis already described is 650,000  tons per month.   The  mostdangerous period will be the first six to nine months of 1918, before either the UnitedKingdom or  the  United  States  obtain  the   full  benefit of  their   enlargedprogrammes.    Despite,  however, the seriousness of these figures,  the submarine campaign iscertainly not likely to force-Great Britain and her Allies to stop- the war, if Americaputs forth her utmost effort.   But unless between them  the Allies can equalise lossesand gains, it will inevitably diminish the effective pressure they can bring to  bearupon the Central Powers.  The British rate of import before the war was 4,900,000tons per month; for 1916 it was 3,700,000 tons per month ; for the  first five months-of 1917 it was only 2,900,000 tons per  month.   The reduction up to 1916 was dueto the use of merchant vessels on purely military and naval work, but since 1916 ithas been mainly due to the submarine campaign.    But it means that our importsare now practically all on War account,  and very near their bedrock figure.  Despiteall efforts to increase the production of foodstuffs and raw material at home, furtherconsiderable  reductions in the amount of shipping available must force us to reducethe supplies of coal and other necessities to our Allies, or of munitions to the fronts,or to abandon military operations  which are vital to the  general strategic  schemefor breaking up the dominion of the Germanic military power over Central Europeand its Balkan and  Turkish  allies.    The part, therefore, which  the  United States can play in dealing with thesubmarine menace is absolutely vital to the successful prosecution of the war and tothe attainment of an early peace.   The two most important spheres in which she canconcentrate her activities are, first, that of increasing the efficiency and the numberof the vessels engaged on the anti-submarine war,  for  protection &quot;of the mercantilemarine is a far more effective measure than replacement.    Of equal importance is  commercial shipbuilding.   The  deficit  to  be  made up,even when our output is  at its maximum, will be between 350,000 and 400,000  tonsper month.  Will American  shipyards be able to supply this amount, and if so, bywhat date ?  As already explained, the period of greatest stress will be the first naifor three-quarters of  1918.  It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that  we shouldknow as soon as possible the probable American monthly output for the next twelvemonths.                                                 1    August 2, 1917.o
