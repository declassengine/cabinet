     I HAVE read Mr.  Halfour&apos;s  despatch No. 433 of the 2nd July,  1917,  to Lord Bertie respecting the territorial aspirations of  the French Government  in connection with the terms of peace.     I note that, &quot; as regards Africa, the French expect to obtain, in the Cameroons and Togoland, the area which we have provisionally handed over to them for purposes of administration.&quot;  In this connection, I would call attention to the Colonial Office note already circulated to  the   War Cabinet  (G.T.-593),  and  I  would urge that our acquiescence in the French  view should be made conditional  on our obtaining from them the minor adjustments  of frontiers  in  the Cameroons  which  are  enumerated therein.    On  the  general  question, I  think  it advisable that we should  come to  an understanding with the French Government that, if we are to support their territorial claims, we shall in turn receive their support of our views  as to  the future ownership of the other German colonies.  The matter seems to me to  be of urgent importance, inview of the approaching Conference for the reconsideration of the &quot;war  aims &quot; of theAllies.                                                                     W. H. L.    July .19, 1917.
