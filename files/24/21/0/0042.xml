HIT                  July ,87th 1917 Italy and  Greece      The negoeiations begun in tho last  days  of June  between the French, Italian  and Greek  Governments  regarding the evacuation of occupied districts (excluding  of course  the Saloniki  zone) has been  considerably prolonged owing to difficulties raised by  the Italian Government about the reinstatement of the Greek authorities in Yanina and retention of Italian troops in the 2UW. corner of Sreek Epirus, opposite  Corfu oovering  the Santi Quaranta road and the shore of the Corfu  channel.   The  Italians consider that  if both shores of the channel were in Greek possession their command of the entrance to the Adriatic would be compromised.   On July 10th the Greek Minister in London officially informed E.M. Govera- ment that,  as the result of an understanding between the ??igh Com- missioner,  the Italian Minister at  Athens and M. Venizelos,  tho Italian evacuation of Epirus would  take place simultaneously with the Frenoh evacuation of occupied territory and the Ionian Isles - excluding Corfu, Thasos, Milos and the zone of the Saloniki armies.  The French had agreed to carry out this evacuation by July 20th but  made an exception with regard to the retnntion of cavalry patrols on the  rrisBa-Brallos-Ithea road.    These also they were willing  to withdraw if M. Venizelos requested it.  The position reached on July loth seems to  be that the evacuations  referred to  in the Greek Minister&apos;s state-ment of July 10th were in process of  being carried out and were
to be completed by July 23rd,  but the French were for thepresent retaining the Larissa-Ithea line and the Italians theangle guarding the Santi Quaranta road.   No public announcementhas,  we believe, as yet been made of the evacuation of Yannlna.     In the Red Sea tho Italians are showing a certain pricklinessever  the British &quot;blockade - asking that  exceptions prejudicialtcrtheT blockade shall be made  in favour  of regular shipment ofcattle from Yemen to Massowah  - such cattle being, in thequantities required, non-existent in Yemen and Asia but easilyobtainable in the regions of Africa bordering the Italian zone.     The Giornale d1 Italia, in announcing the withdrawal ofBritish forces from Salif, goes so far as to explain in a foot-note  that Yemen &quot;is a zone pacifically regarded as under Italianinfluence&quot;.INTERNAL AFFAIRS.     The open sittings of the  Chamber were resumed on June 30th.Discussion of the provisional  credits was begun on July 6th andclosed on July 12th with a large majority for the Government.On July 11th Signor Corcano made a financial statement.Among the figures he gave were the following.&apos;-                                                   Lire.     War-expenses not covered  by Revenue        20,076,000,000     Tax on war profits - Aug.1st 1914 -         Dec 31st 1915.                           248,000,000     (a very much larger sum than was anticipated).     Present annual expenditure on relief of         soldiers&apos;  families                      1,200,000,000     Revenue for 1916-17                         3,467,000,000     (or 1,455,000,000 more than that of 1914-15).These expenses had been met by loans, redeemable and consolidated,by foreign bonds, quinquennial, triennial and ordinary bonds.Other milliards had been provided by advances from Banks andissues of Sotes.  The last Loan had produced a total of 7 milliards.
     The interpretation of the Session as a barometer of Italianopinion in regard to the war is made difficult by the bewilderinglykaleidoscopic phases of the recent crisis and the disturbancescreated by it in the relations of the various groups.     Sonnino&apos;s recent speeches in the Chamber, the interpretationgiven to them by Barzilai (see Weekly Report on Italy, July 6th)and the acceptance by Sonnino, in principle at least, of the newsituation in Greece are indications of a modification, notperhaps of Italy&apos;s official war-claims but of the spirit in whichthey are now being advanced.  T/e cannot go as far as to saywith Turati, the parliamentary leader of the Official Socialists,that the &apos;parecchio&apos; of Sonnino&apos;s recent speeches is hardlydistinguishable from the &apos;parecchio&apos; of Giolitti, but a changeof spirit is certainly observable.     The change is duo to external causes tending to bring Italyinto line with her Allies, not to any weakening on the part ofParliament in its determination to carry the war through to asuccessful issue.  Of this the Session gives no sign.  The Vote ofConfidence given as a matter of Parliamentary expediency to aGovornment so often accused of inadequate efficiency does notsignify any withdrawal of the demand for greater energy.  It iswidely felt that the crisis has only been postponed and that theGovernment is meanwhile on its trial.  No section of theInterventionist Combination is content with Orlando&apos;s managementof internal affairs and it is generally felt that a more vigoroushand than Bosellifs is needed to give unity of direction to thoCabinet.  The demand for an inner war Cabinet is also still alive.     The position taken up by Sonnino in regard to Italy1s war-aimsmay perhaps be gathered from a leading article which the GiornaleUltalia published on July 20th, defending Italian foreign policy
 againet the open or insidious charges of imperialism brought against it at houe dncl abroad and setting forth tho true state of the case &quot;in order that it May be possible to base arguments not on nebulous grounds but on pesitire facts.&quot;   Italy1 s clajjus  re treated under three headings.      1,   The Adriatic Questiou.    As to the lYentino and Trieste there is no dispute.    0?rent-Trieste is on the seme footing as Alsaoe-Otorraine.      It is only when  we come to  Istria and Daitmatia - the Adriatic question proper - that discussions  and sophistications oomaenoe. 33ie Jugo-Slavs have written and intrigued unli:aitedly to establish their &quot;Maximalist&quot; thesis,  according to  which the  Italians have no rights whatever to any part of the  eastern shore of the  Adriatic and ought to he content with Trieste  at  most  if they can get  it. This  thesis had gained  some support  from ^nissian, British and Trench publio  opinion and even among  Italian  democrats,  by whom it  is opposed to a corresponding  &quot;maximalist&quot;  Italian thesis  - a thesis which finds very few supporters - according to which the Ju$o-Slav8 are to be excluded altogether from  the Adriatio Coast.     Such disputation is not  only harmful but  is superfluous. &quot;The Adriatic eniestion was  completely regulated in the pact of Lon- don on the basis of an equitable compromise between Italian and Jugo-Slav aspiraticns, a compromise in substance satisfactory to all parties.&quot;   Since  Serbia cannot seriously propose to contest Italy1B well-established claims  to the Adriatic,  and since Italy on her part has no intention of  denying to Serbia her economic out- let on the Adriatic and has no reason for altering  the friendly feelings towards Serbia of whioh  she has  ^iven constant proof, it is clear that the  controversy between Italians and  Jugo-Slavs  iskept alive by irresponsible persons  &quot;probably inspired by the  enemies
                             - 5* -   alike of Italy and of Serbia,  very likely aided from Vienna.JI  (in-   verted commas  in the  original).        This being so^ controversy is altogether Out of place.    The   question is already settled,  and in ths  settlement Italyt so far   from pursuing  an imperialist  policy, made &quot;large concessions be-   yond which she could  not go without profound and irreprable in-   j-ary to  her own interests -&quot;    It should  be  remembered further that   the  compromise  was  arrived at  under the  auspices of the  old regime   in Russia, which  cannot be supposed to have  been a less  jealous pro-   tector cf Slav  rights than the new  one is likely to prove.        2*   ffhe Question of the  Ionian Sea.    The  imperialism of Italy   is a  spectro conjured Iby Hellenists, especially  Trench Hellenists.        Italy, faithful to the position maintained  by her at the  Con-   ferenoe of London of 1913,  desires  to see Albania  independent  and   net spli^ up between Montenegrins, Serbs, Bulgarians and Greeks or   devoured whole by Austria;   but she has no territorial ambitions of   her own in Albania.   All that she demanis is falona - on strategic   grounds analogous to those  on which other Entente Powers have occu-   pied various  other important positions.    She also desires that the   Southern boundaries of independent Albania shall extend to Cape Stylos   (London and Florence agreements) in order that Greece may not hold   both shores of the Corfu Channel and may not be in a position to   transform the  Channel  into  a strategic base  which would deprive  Talona of its value by commanding from the Ionian the entrance to the  Adriatic  Sea.    That is  all.    Greece is  in  no way menaced by Italy  and may enjoy  in peaoe the  possessions realised in the 2nd Balkan.  17ar provided that she  on hor part respects the independence  of Al-  hahia and the essential  strategic interest of Italy0       3o    ghe Questions  of  the  EasternMet!^rjrjmesgu   It is eon-k tended that in  view of the  prospective international organisation
 there will be an end of colonial expansion in barbarous and semi- barbarous countries and that therefore Italy ought to abandon h9r aspirations in this region.      If the Ottoman question is to be settled on the principle of general renunciation of territorial claims and if this principle is respected by all Powers, it will oertainly not be Italy - the latest comer to the Colonial banquet to whom has fallen only a few scraps and bones -  who  will attempt to go contrary to it.    If, on the contrary, other  Powers, Italy1s Allies,  either in order to complete conquests  hopefully begun during the war or in realisation of old and extensive projects, decide  to establish thcnselves in Asiatic Turkey,  there is no reason why imperialism on the  part of others should be answered by renunciations  on th9 part of  Italy,     As regards  public  discussion  of war-aims,  it is noticeable that the Democratic  press protests  much more  openly and pronounced- ly than ever before  against  the Jingoism of the Nationalists and Imperialists.    Since its previous  silence or quasi-silenoe is ascribed by it to the inequalities  of the Censorship, this new departure may b9 regarded as an indication not only of popular opinion but of Government tendencies..   Mention was made in the last Italian Report of the resolution in a democratic sense carried at an Interventionist Congress on July 2nd, in which the Xeague of Nations W83 invoked.   This and other phenomena indicate an incipient shifting of the oentre of gravity of the Italian Ular 5*rty fromRight to Left, the tendency of the 7eft being to disown the &quot;Sacroegoismo&quot; of Salandra and to subordinate Italian war-alms to thegeneral Allied programme of European reconstruction on democraticlines.     An International Masonic Congress  recently held in Paris  hasgiven rise to much anpry discussion and recrimination in the
Italian press,  because,  although  Italy WAS fully represented there,it passed a resolution formulating conditions of peace in which thewhile the return of Alsaee-I*orraino to Prance was specifically men-tioned,  Italy&apos;a Herre irredente&apos;  were only referred to under thegoneral formula of 1national!ties  at present under the oppressiverulo of the Hapsburg  Empire1 whose fate was to be decided byplebiscite&apos;    (Whether or no the plebiscite clause really formedpart of the resolution has  been the subject of lively dispute)    The incident is of interest in connection with Italian politicschiefly as having provided  opportunity (1) to the Jingo Intervention-ists to discredit the internationalising tendencies of their democraticcolleagues.  (2) to Giolittians  and clericals to sow tares between theAllies.   The appointment is announced of Admiral Del Bono aa Minister inplace of Admiral Trianzi, resigned.    Admiral del Bono,  who was born in 1656,  held a command of someimportance in  the Xribyan oempaign  and since the outbreak of the war  hasbeen successively in  command of the Department of Spezia and GeneralSecretary to the Ministry of L&amp;rine.
