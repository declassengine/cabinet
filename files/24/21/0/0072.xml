Copy No.: 10  31V ?.av.SECRET.0.1/115/331. G.T.  1547W.G.  116/6      MILITARY  SITUATION  Iff  MESOPOTAMIA.    -o-o -o-o-o -e-e-e-o-o-1.     With reference to General Smuts1 memorandum cf tho29th instant.  I stated at a meeting of tho War Cabinet enthe 10th of April last that &quot;information received tendedto indicate that the Turks might attempt t* rocapturoBaghdad, to the possession of which they attached greatimportance.   Provided that the Russians c$uld axeroisepressure from the&apos; Caucasus there was nst much to leapprehended from their efforts, but if, for any reason,Russian cooperation was not forthesming, we might haveto meet the largest number of Turks that the enemy wouldbe able to supply.    Cn a rough computation this numbermight possibly amount, as an outside estimate, to200,000 men,  of whom some 150,000 wculd be fighting men.It would, however,  take several months before thesefigures could be reached&quot;.    Since April loth I have beenin constant correspondence with General Maude and theCommander-in-Chiefr  India,  as te tho preparationsnecessary to  enable us to meet an attack cf this nature.2,     The Turkish Cth Army in Mesopotamia at presentconsists of 7  divisions with a fighting strength of about35,000 rifles.    Our information is to the effect thatthis army Is  being reinforced with a view te undertakingan
                               2.an offensive in the early BAit-omn under command of Field-Marshal von Falkenhayn with a view to the recapture ofBaghdad, but I may say at once that we attach no credibility.to the Foreign Office telegram received last ?;eek, emanatingfrom Berne, that as many as 300,000 to 400,000 troops, ofwhom 160,000 might be Germans, will be employed.  Such aforce could not be supplied by the enemy in the BaghdadVilayet until his railway has been extended.    At presenthis railhead is about 100 miles from Mosul, which itselfis about 150 miles from Samarrah.   Further, we do notestimate that the Turks have more than about 500,000 menin all theatres, and although German machine-guns andartillery, and German officers have been sent to helpthe Turks, and more may be sent, we do not conceiveit probable that many, if any, German divisions can orwill be sent.3.    From the various telegrams circulated the War Cabinetwill have observed that for some time past the Turks havebeen engaged in withdrawing their troops from Europe.  Ofthe two Turkish divisions in Macedonia, one left that frontsome months ago, one or two regiments going tc Mesopotamiaand cne regiment going to Palestine..  The other divisionleft about the end of June and has probably gene toMesopotamia.  Beth the Turkish divisions in Galicia haveprobably been withdrawn though no reports have yet been   %                                             received
received of their having moved east of Constantinople.-The remaining divisions of the Turkish Army which might bemade available for Mesopotamia are distributed as follows :In Roumania2 DivisionsIn Constantinople and  the Dardanelles:2 Divisions.Eh Western Asia  Minor:5 Divisions, of which 3  are believed to be still  incomplete.In the Caucasus:12 Divisions, some of whichmay be transferred toMesopotamia, the numberbeing dependent onthe action of the Russians      In addition to the above,  new units  are reported tobe in formation at Sivas and Mardin.      It is estimated that of the above forces 9 or 10divisions could be made available for transfer to the  6thArmy in Mesopotamia, raising that army to  a total of 16 or17 divisions, or to somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000men.  This was the approximate figure given by me to theWar Cabinet on 10th April.4.
4.   The enemy can operate by three lines of advance, theEuphrates, the Tigris and the route via Kifri andKirkuk and thence along the Shatt-el-Adhaim or Diala.It is improbable that more than two out of the total of16 Turkish-divisions could be maintained on the Euphratesas troops would have to be supplied entirely by riverwhich presents great difficulties for a large force.For the maintenance of an army on the other two lines ofadvance the Turks will have the use of the Baghdadrailway which dees not at present extend beyond Nisibin,and we do not anticipate that it can reach Mosul beforeNovember next at the earliest.  From Mosul the forceon the Tigris line will have to be supplied by motortransport supplemented by water transport in the form ofkiliks or rafts made of skin and floated down the river.Navigation by boat above Tekrit is practically impossible.MoW transport will also be utilized for the Kirkuk -Kifri routec   It is estimated that to supply the remaining14 divisions  on these two lines cf advance would require500 motor lorries.  There are probably under 300 motorlorries now in Mesopctamia but 30 lorries per week arereported tc be going there by rail from Europe.5.    Reliable reports  show that the enemy wishes  to commenceoperations about the end of September,  by which  time he  mighthave a fighting force of 96,000 rifles,  320 field  and 64 heavyguns
guns in Mesopotamia.  This estimate is a very favourableone from the enemy&apos;s point of view, as the Turks on theTigris line would be operating at a distance of 150 milesfrom their base at Mosul while those an the KirkukKifri line would be about 200 miles from Mosul.  Asrailhead will at that date be still far short ef Mosulthe Turkish forces will be mainly dependent sn motortransport for a line of communications at least 200miles in length.    We have, in fact, definite informa-tii-n that the headquarters of the 6th Army has repres-ented to Turkish General Headquarters that owing tctheir difficulties and the state of the army generallyit is doubtful whether it would be possible t$ beginan offensive as early as the end of September en thescale estimated above.6 *   Since my report to the War Cabinet in April theWar Cffice has been taking steps tc place General Maudein a position to meet a Turkish offensive.  His divisionshave been supplied with machine-gun companies similar tothose Tire have in Prance, and he has now 900 such guns anhis Tigris front.    3 batteries ef 6-inch howitzers weresent cut in May, and during the summer 12 infantry batt-ali^ns have been sent from India.     In addition, Iarranged with the Commander-in-Chi^f in India te send 6more battalions, which will arrive in August and willenable General Maude to relieve for service cn the Tigrisfront gcod battalions now en his Line ef Cammunicatians.India is further providing 6,000 additional nativeinfantry to raise the Indian battalions in Mesopotamiato a higher Establishment.
I informed General Maude of these arrangements andalso told him that 9 more field batteries, a 60 pdr.battery and an air squadron were on route, and that Ihoped to send him two more 6&quot; Howitzer batteries.  Iasked.him &quot;to let me know if he was satisfied that bythese measures he would be enabled to meet any attackwhich may be reasonably expected&apos;&apos;.General Maude replied that &quot;if our outstanding demands,especially as regards mechanical transport, are fully metand, as casualties occur, ranks of our units here arepromptly filled, I feel no anxiety as to our ability tomeet successfully considerably superior numbers of Turks&quot;.I attach the complete telegrams which passed, as anAppendix.7.      Since the above&apos; interchange of telegrams 12 Mount-ain guns have been sent out in order to release good gunsnow detained on the lines of communication, and all theadditions referred to above, as well as other demandsmade by General Maude, will be at Basra by or before theend of- August, except part of one Mechanical TransportCompany and Dome few unimportant details which will arriveby or before the end of September,        The effect of the above measures will be to Increasethe fighting strength of our forces on the Tigris front from                                                   60,000
The60,000 rifles and sabres to 75,000 when concentration iscomplete.-   As regards artillery our present strength on theTigris front is 134 field and 72 heavy guns.   When the re-infor cements arrive our strength will be 206 field guns and84 heavy guns and howitzers.8,     Since he occupied Samarroh General Maude has beensteadily preparing defensive positionc covering Baghdad,The line Bakubah- Deltawa - Sindiyeh has been stronglyentrenched as a rear line of defence.   In advance of thisline a strong natural position has been selected andentrenched covering Samarrah station with a second positiontwo or three miles in rear, and a third about Istabulat.On the left bank of the Tigris Samarrah town is held as abridgehead,.and a position has been selected on this banklevel with that on the right, which can be occupied andentrenched at short notice, should the military situationrequire it.   Another bridgehead has been prepared on theleft bank of the Tigris near the confluence of the Shatt-el-Adhaim and that river.   Finally on the Euphrates aline has been prepared covering Felujah.       In these preparations for defence General Maude hashad in view the retention of a large striking force in hisown hand, so as to enable him to manoeuvre freely and ifpossible forestall the enemy in attack.9. .    In order to give General Maude full mobility, greatefforts have been made to extend and improve his communica-tions,   The river transport on the Tigris is now veryefficient right up to Baghdad.
     The embankment of the railway from Basra to Kurna hasbeen constructed and tho bridge over the Tigris is now Inhand.  This line will be completed by the cool weather.     The metre gauge railways from Kurna to Amara and fromKut to Baghdad have been completed,     A 2&apos;6,T line has been laid from Baghdad to Bakuba whichwill be converted to metre gauge.     The section of the Baghdad railway between Baghdad andSamarrah is being used to a considerable extent though thereis a shortage 6r\ engines on this line,  which we are endeavour-ing to remedy..     Other lines are under construction from Baghdad toMusaijib on the Euphrates, and from Baghdad to Felujah.General Maude will thus have lines radiating north,  east andwest from Baghdad,  and with the completion of the Kut -Baghdad line and with the increased facilities for drawingon the resources of the country which these branch lines give.is able to regard with equanimity the period of low water onthe Tigris.10. &apos; It is impossible to say how far we shall be able torely on Russian assistance in Mesopotamia as this willdepend upon developments In Russia and  on the conditionof the Russian forces in Persia whose morale Is at presentvery low.  General Maude stated on 18th dune that hecould supply a Russian force of 14,000  men and 6,000 horsesvia the Tigris - Jessan - Mendall route.   Since that datehowever the Russians have retired to Paitak and are  thusseparated from Mendali by mountain tracks impracticablefor wheeled transport,  General Brusiloff has agreed to
this force of 14,000 men being supplied by General Maude,and that it should advance to the Diala and operate underGeneral Maude1s orders.  However, in view of GeneralBrusiloffs other preoccupations at present it is doubtfulhow far we shall be able to push this very desirable schemethrough.     The Russians have definitely stated their intentionof resuming their advance on the Persian frontier towardsthe end of October and all measures possible in presentcircumstances for securing their c-o-operation have been takenby us.  The Russians seem to believe themselves capable ofmaking this offensive and it is reasonable to hope that,unless there is a complete collapse of the Russian Army inEurope, some help will be forthcoming.  In view,  however,  ofthe present military situation and the condition of theRussian troops we should not be justified in relying on muchsupport, and our plans should be based on the assumption thatwe shall have to meet the brunt of the Turkish offensivesingle-handed.   The present strength of the Russian forceson the Persian front is 40,000 rifles and sabres 90 fieldand 4 heavy guns.  If the Turks are able to disregard thisforce altogether they may bring 96,000 rifles 320 fieldand 64 heavy guns against General Maude1s 75,000 rifles206 field and 72 heavy guns.  But&apos; if the Russians showeven moderate -activity the Turkish force operating againstBaghdad should be reduced to 72,000 rifles 240 field and48 heavy guns,
11.If the Russians do not come forward there will bea gap between them and General Maude&apos;s right, through whichhostile parties may penetrate into Persia and cause dis-turbance, or they may, perhaps assisted by Kurds and Arabs,attempt to carry out raids against our communications.These are, however, well guarded by troops over and abovethose already mentioned as being on the Tigris front, and the raidscould not do more than cause temporary inconvenience.12.      On the whole I feel confident in General Maude1spower to hold his own in Mesopotamia.   In giving thisassurance I am relying on General Mauders proved skill asa leader, the high morale of his troops,  the time he hashad to make his preparations for defence, the superiorityof his communications, and the equipment  of his force.  Forexample, in calculating the capacity of the Turkish Commun-ications it has been estimated that for a force of tho sizenamed they would not be able to transport more than 1,400rounds per field gun.     General Maude will have inMesopotamia some 3,600 rounds per field gun, between 2,400and 4,000 for each heavy gun and howitzer according to theirnature, and arrangements have been made to keep up hissupply.    Further, I do not think it at  all probable thatthe Turks could bring up, or supply with  ammunition, as manyas the 900 machine-guns which General Maude has.   I must,however, remind the War Cabinet that the  possibility ofkeeping him up to strength both in men and munitions, acondition of his success, depends upon whether the necessaryshipping is forthcoming, and in this connection I may saythat
W.R. ROBERTSON.C.I.Lr.S*reneral Staff,  War Office.31st July, 1917.that it may not be possible to give him the necessary horsesand mules unless the Cabinet rescind their decision regardingthe shipment of horses from Australia.    Ample mobility isthe most essential factor for success,  and therefore ashortage of horses may be serious.      Notwithstanding what has been said above, it is onlyreasonably prudent that we should do everything in our powerto reduce the strain which may be put upon eur forces inMesopotamia to a minimum, and as  a considerable part of theTurkish reinforcements for Mesopotamia and all the ammunitionand stores not now there must come from Europe, we should makeevery effort to divert as much of these as possible to thePalestine front.  This is my reason for advocating the earlyreinforcement of General Allenby  so that he may be in aposition to take the offensive with effect.
                    APPENDIX.OPERATIONS. &apos;                                        SECRET.From    C .T.G.S.To       G.O.C., G.H.Q.,  Mesopotamia.              2,7.17.                                                      2.35 p*m.*          (Repeated C-in-C.,  India.)37077 Cipher.        I have asked C.-in-C.y India what he is ahle to doto relieve seme of your best battalions on tho L, of C. so asto give you a larger reserve at the front to meet eventualities .He can, ho informs me/ arrange to despatch 104th Rifles, 13thRajputs, ?139th Baluchis, 83rd Carnatics to reach Basra earlyin August with 1st line Transport and regimental medical estab-lishment.   If wo can supply officers for India, possibly twomere battalions may be available.   This question I am investigat-ing at once.        Will you require anything from England tc enable you tomake full use of the battalions relieved from the L. of C. ?You are aware of the shipping difficulties and of the time whichIs required to send you anything from England, and while I amanxious tc place you in the best possible position for meetingthe expected Turkish offensive I rely on your making everypossible use of local resources.         The 9 field batteries and the heavy battery and theair squadron promised you left a week ago, and I hope veryshortly to get off the two six-inch Howitzer batteries.         Cv-in-C, India hopes to be able to keep you up tostrength and to send 6,000 additional drafts by middle ofAugust to bring Indian battalions up tc British establishment.I  regret that we aro unablo to do the same for the BritishBattalions on Indian Establishment.         Please let me know if you are satisfied that bythese measures you will be enabled to meet any attack whichmay reasonably be expected.
SKCKST.    &quot;          OPERATIONS.From :- G.O&apos;.C&quot;-in-C,  Mesopotamia.               4.7.17.To      CI.G.S.                                 ? P*m.2,2713.   Your. 37077.        For some time I have been thinking out my lines ofcommunication defences with result that I have collected 8 unallottedbattalions which are  moving up here gradually in order to relieveBaghdad garrison and  certain posts on Dialha, Tigris and auphratesand thus enable troops now holding those places to join theirdivisions.   Any guns  that could be spared to go into these postsand so free our divisional artillery entirely would be welcome.  Ishall probably require 3&apos;additional brigade staffs to organize myunallotted battalions and for purposes of command but as to these Iwill communicate separately from time to time.  These additional &amp;battalions now  promised, by India will be of great assistance infurthering my policy, which aims at assembling every fighting manavailable on this front.    I shall require however two of thesebattalions from India for administrative duties on communications forwe  are very shorthandsd there as already represented;   so net gainwill be 4 battalions  only.   Our requirements are always endless butI realize very fully  need to economize all round and have for sometime past done  so,  I  know too how vital it is that  we  should notask for things which  are  not absolutely necessary at  expense cf otherfronts and I am in consequence developing local resources to best ofmy  ability,   The results in this respect are encouraging.   If thenour outstanding demands,  especially as regards Mechanical Transport,are fully met and as  casualties ooour,  ranks of our units here arepromptly filled,  I  feel no anxiety as to our ability  to meetsuccessfully considerably superior&apos;number of Turks.    In fact it  should not  be impracticable to clear Tigris  of Turkishforces by close cf  this year if Russians will co-operate  vigorously.    Addressed CI.G.S.    repeated G.-0.C-in-C.,  India.
