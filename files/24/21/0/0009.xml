Poland BPvT/olQ           Weekly Report on Poland. X.                  J-yly^Mth, ,1917.      The position in Poland is becoming  serious;   the broach between   the radical-socialist Left and  the  new  conservative bloo is widening   rapidly;  it may soon become irreparable  and drive the Left into an   opposition of an oxtreme character.   On  the other hand the conser-   vatlves, threatened by the open opposition from  the radicals and   freed from the check which these had  exurcieed in the past on their   &quot;conciliatory&quot; policy with regsrd&apos;to  the  Central powers,  are advrneing   along that road;  the Central Powers  will probably meet them halfway,   in order to invest the policy of &quot;compromise&quot;  among the Polos  with   the appearances of success.   It vail be  tlje interest of the Central   Powers to strengthen the ruthority  and  influence of the new   governmont and of the reorganised Council of State as against  the   revolutionary Left;  moreover they  can  afford  to make concessions   to tho government of Iaibomirskl, a  Niemojowski or a T&amp;rnowski,   such  as they ?/ould hardly have  made to  a  Polish  government led by a   man of the stamp of Rlsudski.ijf     On July 2 Brigadier-General Pilsudski end  three other members    &quot;   of the Left resigned their seats in the Council  of State.    Each of   them  seems to have stated his reasons separately,  and no  joint pro-   grammatic declaration seems to  hove been  made  by the Left.   Pilnudski is reported to have said  that he had joined the Council   with  a view to forming a Polish Army, and that he sees  no possibility   at present of realising that aim, because the  Council of  State  has  not   got control over military matters.    Janskowski  and Stolarski  are .
treported  to have  put  the maim  emphasis  on food-problems,  Sliwinski onthe failufe of the  Council  to  obtain any real concessions from theCentral Powers.   These reports  cannot  be absolutely relied upon, asthey come mainly  from conservative  quarters,  which have an obviousinterest  in minimising the  significance of the breach;   though on theother hand it is  quite possible  that the Left once more deliberatelyavoided slamming  the  door.    The programme of  the Left  is anyhow well-known.    Its most impor-tant group, the nationalist wing of the Polish Socialist Party(Pi!J.sudski 1 s organisation)  has quite recently re-stated it with referenceto the present situation.    It demands  that the doterminising of thefuture constitution of Poland  be loft to a Constituent Assembly;   thePolish Socialist  Party declares  in  favour of  a republic,  &quot;becausethat form alone vnswers the political interests of the Poli3h workingclasses and will  secure the Polish  State against having the will ofthe neighbouring  States imposed  on  it through the intermediary of. aKing&quot;.   &apos;^hey further declare  that  they will  support a Polish Pro-visional  Government only  (1) if  it  is independent (i.e. in Warsmv, ofthe Central Powors);   (2)   if  it makes  it its first business tosummon a  Constituent  Assembly, elootod  by equal and universal suffrageon the proportional system;  (3) if its composition corresponds to thereal strength of  the  different parties  end groupments (i.e.  dif the con-servatives ooncede  in it a  sufficiont share to the Left).    On tho very next  day after the  withdrawal oi the Left (July 3) theCouncil of State     I.   acoepted  the proposals of the Joint Committee for &quot;the         Provisional Organisation  of the Polish Supreme  Offices  of g$-         State&quot;.    II.   fixed the oath to be taken by the Poliah legions.   III.   decided to  publish in  the near future am appeal for volunteers         to  join the Polish Army;   a Committee has  been  appointed to          draft ito
                         3.    Each of these measures is a provocation to Pilsudski and theLeft.    Having secured t&amp;e support of the most prominent late pro-Russian conservatives,  and ne doubt encouraged by the Central Powers,the conservatives and &quot;moderates&quot; in the Council are slamming thedoor.which,  in the national interest,the left had tiled to keep^n.  .  /&apos;    &apos;   The official text of the proposals of the -Foint Committeeis not yet to hand,  but everything seems to indicate that the out-lines  given in our Sepfrt on July 13 are correct.   Alongside withthe formation of the new Cabinet, tho eoipacil of State is to bechanged into a quasi-Senate consisting of. 50 members.   It is to bechosen by a triumvirate oomposed of Archbishop Kakowski, Crown-.Marshall Uiem^owski,  and Prince Lubomirski, acting in conjunctionwith a delegation of 10 members from the present Ceuncil of State.$UflN&amp;e latter was formed in December 1916, every sincere democratejected and demanded that it.shouidl prepare for summoning a demo-*&amp;*atil Diet with the least possible delay.    After half a year of theCouncilTs existence,  a scheme resembling those, of the Napoleonic&quot;eSnstitutipns&quot; of 1800-1806 seems all that the reactionary bloc is          -*                                       .   &apos;oapable of producing!    II.  .  The oath taken by the Legions at Warsaw on July 9 and inthe provinces on July 13,  is no less characteristic of the newsituation.   It promises faithful service &quot;to the Kingdom of Poland  ,and its future King&quot;,  and &quot;faithful brotherhood in arms in thepresent War to the armies of Germany and Austria-Hungary and oftheir. Allies&quot;.   (Originally the Germans had demanded an oath tov theGerman Emperor a3 Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of the CentralEuropean Alliance.   They soon recodod from -that demand (some,;timein February), but oven then no understanding could be reached: v
                                                                 3d t.                           4.probably Pilsudski and the radicals objected to the form adopted,because  tp limits seriously the independence of the Polish State,which forms the first point in the programme of the PolishSocialiltjt Party.   Moreover the very formula of the military oathprejudg^a.C;.the question whether Poland is to be in   future a.^na&apos;rf^/&apos;^;..it-. republic.    III.-   When in autumn 1916. Brigadier-General Pilsudski resignedhib command,  W.Lt  tfawbrski, fcne of the chief leaders of the pro-    *&quot; -.* J.. - &apos;Austrli conservatives in Craffcw and Tice-president of the SupremeNatjMipal... Committee of Galicia,  beggai him in a letter of Oot.5, tosend a word of encouragement to his soldiers - &quot;to your soldierswho see in you the symbol of work for (Bolish) Independence.&quot;&quot;The name of Pilsudski,&quot; he went on to say&quot;will remain inseparablefrom the legions and the Polish Army&quot;.   But on the day after &apos;Pilsudski had declared that euch an army cannot be formed at present.the Council decides t$ publish the long delayed recruiting appeal.As a matter of faot it had once before (on April 21)  decided to d&amp;so but did not dare to carry put its decision against.the oppositionof the Left.   It might seem peculiar that important decisions regard-ing the Army should be adopted by tho present Council of State,when it is about to dissolve in favour of a new Government and a newCouncil.   The expectation, which seems most probable,  is that thisis meant to save the face of the late pro-Russians who are to jointhe new Council.   Before the Russian Revolution they had opposedall military action in Poland;   it might, therefore,&apos; prove embar- .rassing for them if their first act had to be the publishing of arecruiting appeals   If it were that tho o&amp;o-Austrians tried to
settle jtEe  quastl^n &quot;before their new associates gained any officialroicel^:&apos;the  matter,  one would expect signs of excitement over itamong-    litter.    But so far none are discernable.   The &quot;KurjerPosxJ&amp;nftki-^. the issost important party organ of the National-Democrats in  Posnania,  in its  issue of July 11, discusses withremarkable  equanimity the political developments in Warsaw, andspeaks about  the  possibility of M.  Stecki,  the leader of theNational Democrats  in the Austrian sphere of occupation, assumingoffice in one Cabinet with prince Drucki-Lubecki,  probably the mostabject pro-German from Posnania.    This is the more significant, asthe &quot; urjer Poznanski&quot; is,  or  at least has been hitherto, uncom-promisingly anti-German - which means,  of course,  something verydifferent in  Posnania from what it means in Petrograd or Warsaw.    The &quot;new  oourse&quot;  on the part of the Central Powers may be dis-cerned in the following facts;    (1)   On  July 2,  the day ow which Pilsudski resigned, the&quot;Deutsche Warsohauer  Zeitung&quot;,  the  semi-offioial German paper inWarsaw, published an  article vv^ich tries to&apos; explain-away differentmeasures which the  German authorities have recently taken with regardto the Legions and  whioh have  given much offence to the Poles, andalso  the sorapping  of the recruiting offices in the smaller provin-cial  towns.    These arc to  be  rc-cstublishod soon.    (2)   Dr.  Rosner,  one of Austria&apos;a  representatives at Warsaw,  hasdeclared in the name  of his Government  that it does not think ofwithdrawing its subjects irom  the Polish Legions as long as thewar lasts.    This closes an old and pointed controversy.     (3)   On July  3  Count  Hutten-Czapski read out  to  the Council   Stats a  declaration of the  German Government concerning the    ing over  of Government  Departments  to the  Poles and concerning
the organisation of  the future Polish  Government.    It hardly con-tains  anything new,  but makes a marked show of an  acoommadatingspirit with regard to the  carrying  out of  previous agreements.Baron  Konopka, the chief agent of Austria-Hungary  accredited to theCounoil, associated  a&amp;fck himself with  that declaration,  congratu-lated  the Council of State on having  &quot;settled  speedily and thoroughlythe important scheme of government&quot; etc.     (4)   It also seems that the question of  food-control is notquite  as serious as  the facts mentioned above  would indicate;   sofar wc know only the facts, but have no direct information about themotives .   About these we have to  form our own suppositions.    Yetthe withdrawal of the left, and the formation  of a reactionary bloc,create evn under any conceivable extenuating circumstances a positionBO  new and fraught with such dangers that  it has to  be taken seriouslyinto account.
