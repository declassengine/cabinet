ndon/65.              y&amp;r Cabinet.         Air Defence of London.-flTnftT^ndnm bv the Secretary of State for War.          I have discussed the recommendations of the Committeeon Air Organisation and Home Defence against Air Raids with thsField Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home Forces, the General Staffat the War Office, the Director General of Military Aeronauticsand the Master General of the Ordnance, and I forward for theinformation of the War Cabinet a copy of the instructions whichhave been issued today to the Field Marshal Commanding-m-ChiefHome Forces as a result of that discussion,   I think it isonly right to add that Lord French has, in a letter dated 21stJuly, asked for five additional squadrons as compared with thethree plus a potential reserve recommended by the Committee,DERBY.27th July,  1917.Letter from the War Office to the F,M.C.in C. Home Forces.           With reference to the report of the recent War Cabinet Committee on Air Organisation and Home Defence against Air Raids, a copy of which is in your possession, and to the Conference held by the Secretary of State for War on the .24th instant at which you were present, I am commanded by the Army Council to inform you that a senior officer with practical flying experience will be placed at your disposal for the special purpose of working out plans for the defence of London against aerial attack.           In this connection your attention is particularly directed to paragraph 3 of the Report referred to above in which the necessity of taking precautions for the air defence of London as the nerve centre of the Empire is emphasised.   As however the scheme for air defence of London cannot be considered apart from the scheme for the defence of the HZtt area and is also closely connected with the air defences of the United Kingdom in general the Council consider that the exact status of the officer placed at your disposal for working out plans for the defence of London will best be determined when you have with his assistance completed the plans for air defence which you now have in hand.      2.   As regards the question of an increase in the number of anti-aircraft guns for the defence of London, referred to on page 4 of the Report under reference and in your H.F.C.R. 137S3 (A,A.) of July 23rd, I am to say that as there is no immediate prospect of obtaining anti-aircraft guns from otherj sources the Council propose to refer to the War Cabinet thej question of the re-allotment to Home Defence of a proportion of future supplies of 3&quot; 20 cwt, ACA, equipments which by a War Cabinet decision of December last were diverted.   Meanwhile you will no doubt consider the auestion of transferring to theLeiidon
        London Defences  such guns as can be^ made available  from the        defence  of places lees likely  to be attacked.             3.   In regard to the completion  and  training  of  the three        additional squadrons Royal Plying Corps which have  been        allotted for Home Defence, I am to say that  the whole  of the        personnel and machines for two squadrons will be  available and        at  the disposal  of the Officer Commanding  Home Defence Group        in  a  few days, and that the measures for their completion        should be pushed forward as quickly as possible.    One of these        squadrons [No, 44) will be equipped with fSopwith Camels1 and        the other (No. 61) with *Sopwith Pups1,    The  ?Sopwith Camels1        Btill required to complete No, 44 Squadron to 18  machines will        be  available this week.    Sufficient  fSopwith Pups1 with 100   -        Mono Gnome engines to equip No, 61 Squadron  have  already been        handed over to the Home Defence Wing.                 The  third squadron (No. 112) will  be formed  from No,78        Squadron now in  the Brighton area and will be equipped with        *Sopwith Pups1 with 100 Mono-Soupape engines; the equipment of        this  squadron will be completed before the end of August. No,78        Squadron will still be maintained on its present  basis.            4,   The formation of a fjarther reserve of aircraft for        Home Defence is  dependent on output and a  further communication        on  this point will be addressed to you,            5,   I am to request that your plans  for the air  defence  of        the     area in  general and for London in particular may be        completed with the least possible delay and a report furnished        to  this office when this has been done.
