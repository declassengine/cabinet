    - JOINT RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO THE INCREASE OFSHIPS&apos;  PLATES AND SECTIONS BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE         ADMIRALTY AND MINISTRY OP MUNITIONS.               ..- &apos;  29th JULY, - 1917.(1)         The  principal  difficulty is  in producing suffi-      cient ships&apos;  plates.    rlith regard to  &apos; sections&apos;,  these      do not present  the  same  difficulty and the production      can he increased as necessary by  allowing the Section      Mills to  roll sections  for  shipyards without interrup-      tion  by other orders, and by giving instructions  that      in the case  of  mills  which  roll both ships&apos;  sections      and shell steel the ships&apos;  sections should have priority      over  shell steel whenever there is a shortage of  Pig      Iron,  or  other  circumstance affecting  the production      of steel.(2)    .     Arrangements should Immediately be made to      supply all the  Plate  Mills  with whatever  Ingots,  Billets,      or Slabs  they require in order to  enable  them to  work to      their full rolling  capacity.   Instructions  should also      bo issued, as in the  case of  the Section  Moiling  Mills,      that  plates  for ships are to  take  preference-over  shell.      It would  appear that  increases could be obtained by      supplying the following  mills with additional material or      by decreasing shell steel output.T&quot;rrrrii   it&quot;  in 11 in n i in ii mi.

From these figures  it would appear  that  6375  extra  tons  ofplates can be obtained3  &quot;but it  would not be  prudent  to  rely uponthe full extent of this  increase being realised.  An amountof 50C0 tons may, however, be confidently  anticipated^
,j e      in. order to ascertain 7fh.eth.er any further increase   In production could bo obtained from existing plate mills,   it is desirable that the output of each plate mill should   oe investigated locally by representatives of the Admiralty   and the Ministry of Munitions conjointly,  and that the   Question should be taken up by a Committee of representatives   of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions with a view   to increasing the production of the necessary material for   shipbuilding, as quickly as possible,,4)0     Investigations are being made-to ascertain what   Mills rolling thin sheets unsuitable for ship construction   could roll thicker plates which could be used for this work.,   It is anticipated that in this way,  and by the use of smaller   plates for the smaller craft, between 1,500 and 2,000 tons   of plates could be produced, by mills which have hitherto   manufactured thin sheets only,   This would mean a correspond-   ing reduction In the output of sheets.(5-1,-      The following extensions and new mills have been   arranged for by the Ministry of Munitions,- but it will bo   noticed that the major part of the extra tonnage to be   obtained will not be available for 12 months.. It is,  therefore   recommended that instructions should bo issued to the effect   that work in connection with those&apos; extensions should be ^iver   the utmost priority, both as regards labour and-material, and   that arrangements for expediting this construction should be   sanctioned and pushed on as soon as  possible;.  In addition   to the extensions and new Mills already arranged, it  is   considered that the Appleby Scheme put  forward by the
     Frodirigham Iron &amp; Steel  Go,, which is situated on the     Lincolnshire Ore Field,  where there is abundance cf ore,     and at present no labour difficulties, should be put in     hand at once, as&apos; this scheme only requires a negligible     quantity of imported ore.  It must be realised that this     scheme will not be in operation before-18 months&apos; time.     When the works begin to produce they will yield 3,000     tons of steel per week.ADDITIONAL PLATE MILLS IN PROGRESS TO INCREASE THE PRESENT.

           To  obtain  the  increased output and to  effect the extensions mentioned,  skilled  labour  will be required and it  is  urgently recommended  that  the skilled  men  necessary should be released from  the  Army.     This will mean about 500 men.          At  the present moment,  considerable quantities  of shell  steel are being  exported from this  country to Prance and it is very strongly recommended that  the quantity of this steel should be reduced and  the  difference  made up by supplying an  equal amount from America.    There are over 200,000 tons  of French Shell Steel in the  United States wtitinrV to be shipped, and in  order to relieve the  situa- tion and to enable Fills  now  rolling Frencbi Shell  Steel  to be  put on to  the work of&apos;producing ships&apos;  sections  and  slabs for plate hills, as much as possible  of the  shell steel in America should be shipped to France.          T&quot;&apos;0 Li in is try of I.munitions is receiving increased demands from  all departments for steel.    If these  increased demands are met even in part,  it ij quite  impossible  to supolv the quantity of material for shipbuilding- that is necessary.    It is,  therefore  suggested that  instructionsbe given that no further increases to  other Departments should be allowed,  over and above those which they receivedfor the month of Fay, and that moreover,  as far  as possible. the quantities for  other departments should be reduced.
^g)t           The Admiralty suggests that In view of the shortage    of steel at the present moment, no ships1 plates should be    snipped to France or Italy until the increased production    allows of their being exported without interfering with the    output of the British Shipbuilding Yards.10)            The Admiralty further suggests that, as a large    quantity of steel is used in constructional work, the    supplies of plates over a ^&quot; to all constructional work    other than steel works extensions should during the next    six weeks be reduced by 25% below the quantity supplied to    such work during the month of May;  and similarly that the    supply of plates over a -f should be reduced In the case of    &quot;Tanks&quot; by 25%)  in the case of the War Office supplies    by 15%;  and to all other services (with the exception of    Gune, Locomotives, Machine Tools, Paravanes, Stampings,    Steel Works Repairs and Sundries) by 10% taking the    quantity supplied during the month of  ay as a basis.       The quantity of plates of    and upwards to be supplied to    other services than Admiralty would then be as follows
