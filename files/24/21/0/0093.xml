N^\SEVENTH REPORT BY THE BOARD OF TRADE ON IMPORTS            AND INDUSTRY IN RELATION TO SHIPPING.                                             July 27tn, 1917.   v       The present report deals with            (1)  The timber situation            (2)  Imports oi &amp;o&amp;6 of tiio chief restricted goods                  in the first half of July.            (3)  Entrances and clearances.            (4)  Losses of ships up to July 22nd,                           I.                  The timber situation.       The provisional results of the Timber Control&apos;s  fourth census of imported soft woods are now to hand. Omitting  the prtrprops,  which present a distinct problem, the results  are as follows          Stocks of Imported Softwoods in hands of                Merchants and Consumers.          Marcn 31,  1917  ............. 1,360,000 tons.          April 30,   8    ............. 1,302,000  &quot;          May 31,     *.............   960,000  M          June 30,   &quot;    .............   774,000  &quot;  /            / Some returns have still to  come in, so that this                figure will be raibed by  an uncertain amount.      The very heavy reduction in May was due to requisition-  ing ef timber by the Control Department.   T*ie requisitioned  stocks, which in some oases were still  in merchants&apos; hands,  were excluded from the May returns.       In recent discussions the Timber Control Department  estimated  the private stocks early in  July at 600,000 tons.  This was not an underestimate from the  point of view of                            (1)
 of the timber still  in private hands readily available for departmental use  in the future;  because, of the 774,000 tons  reported at the end of June, less than 300,000 tons were  in  merchants&apos; hands, the balance be in- in the hands  of consumers.:     It will  be noted that these returns have always re- ferred to  imported wood only.  Probably some small, stocks of  home grown wood are  being collected, in merchants&apos; hands; for trade  reports from nearly all districts at the end of June refer to the developments in the home trade.   The following  extracts from the Timber Trades Journal local reports are interesting.  Southampton:   &quot;the ono redeeming feature&quot; is that &quot;homo  timber is no?/ coming forward much better&quot;.   Hartlepool:   &quot;English timber is well to the fore&quot;. Bristol:   &quot;some firms are getting over the newness of the home timber trade&quot;.  Cardiff:   the &quot;Home trade&quot; is &quot;increas- ingly aggressive&quot;.     It  is, however,  often stated that home supplies are quite  Inadequate (e.g. Glasgow),  or that home  timber is &quot;a poor tool&quot; (extract from a  very depressed Manchester report).  A typical report  comes  from Grimsby:   &quot;the homegrown side of the  trade shows  increased activity ...  but supplies remain woefully insufficient  to meet requirements&quot;, *                         II,                       Imports.     xhe following table shows  the  amount  of Fruit,  Wood,Paper and Paper Making Materials  and  other restrictedgoods licensed and imported during  March,  April, May and June 1917:-

Por raw fruit these licenses  amounted to 1,700 tons:   for wood manufactures  to 9 tons and  for other restricted goods  to 2,712 tons.   No appreciable difference is,  therefore, made by the inclusion of  the  Paris licenses.    The following point may be noted.    The  quantity of wood and wood manufactures  licensed  for June was very much greater than in any &quot;of the three preceding months.   The same thing is true of paper and paper-making materials.   Forwood, however, the amount actually imported was only a little greater than in May,  when actual imports exceeded, licenses.   The quantity of paper and paper-making materials actually imported was less than in May.     The following tablosshow the amount of paper-makingmaterials,  paper,  pitprops,  other wood and fruit for eachmonth of this year and zlso similar figures for July,  on the aeeumption that the imports of the second half of themonth will equal those for the first half:-

     It will  he seen that paper-making materialsshow a considerably larger decrease on 1916 than theydid in June, but a considerably smaller decrease on1913,   The natural inference is that in 1916 June wasxn abnormally bad month.   Similarly imports of fruit how a smaller decrease on 19-6 than they did in Junebut a larger decrease on 1913,  the natural inferencebeing that in 1916 June was an abnormally good month.There is no mother change that callr for comment.                     III.            Entrances and Clearances.     Entrances, especially of British vessels, during  thefirst  20  days of July are the highest this year.   kcomparison with the same^month of last year  snows thatthis is by no means wholly due to the usual seasonalimprovement.   Should the rate for the first twenty dayscontinue, British entrances will for the first timesince February, have exceeded those of the correspondingmonth of 1916, the excess this year being Sfo - consider-ably less than was suggested by the figures of the firstten days, but still satisfactory.   Foreign entrancesremain less than half those of last year.    Clearancesof British vessels appear rather better, as compared with1916 than they were last month..   Clearances as a wholecontinue to stand at a little over a third of what theywere in 1913.

The  lossesduring the third week of July v?ere somewhat greaterthan in either of the two preceding v/eeks.   If  forthe whole month they work out at the same rate as duringshe first twenty-two days they will come  to a little over300,000 tons.   During the first two-thirds of Julythe gains from all causes of ships actually availablefor service have amounted to nearly 110,000 tons orabout half of the losses.   Of these gains  about 53,000tons represented new vessels that have been completed.(a)Shipping Losses and (Jains*
