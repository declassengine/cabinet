I    STRIKES    ?he trouble which has been brewing in the South Wales Coal field   some time past has come to a head during the past week at  two  centres.  the Ebbw Vale a dispute occured on the 24th at the Victoria Colliery  /the breakdown of an electric winding gear.   The men made a demand   an inspection by an electrical engineer of their own choosing  which   refused by the Management.   The 800 men employed in the pit accordingly  rrned tools&quot; and afterwards succeeded in persuading a further 7,000 men  loyed in the neighbouring pits to join them.    In i/ionmouthshire at the Tredegar Colliery a strike of 4000 to 5000 men  ured on the 26th.   The trouble arose owing to the allegation of  tain men at the Ty Tryst Colliery that those who are working/abnormal  ces are not being paid the minimum wage awarded by Lord St. Aldwyn and  t the Management is adopting various -subterfuges in order to escape  the  den ef payment - this is a complaint which has been reported elsewhere.    As is reported below, these strikes have now been settled    The miners at the Harton Colliery (South Shields) who were last week ported to be on strike to the number of over t^o thousand have returned  work pending negotiation    as have also the five thousand  men  who d ceased work at the Brodsworth Colliery (Doncaster).   Other small rikes among coal miners have also come to an end but that at the llington Pit, Whitehaven, still continues.   Apart from the mining industry there have been but few important rikes, though several of those which have occured are interesting m  the point of view of the principle involved.   At the Crown Steel rks at Wednesbury 1800 men ceased work owing to the action of one of  the nagers in refusing work to an ex-employee who had left the firm  to Join e Army,  and being discharged had returned to ask for his old job.   The nagement thereupon agreed to reinstate the man and the strikers  returned  work.   The incident is not without significance however.   There was a strike of some hundreds of men at Messrs. Lane&apos;s  Ltd. Id Ford) ,owing to the firm&apos;s action in dismissing an unskilled workman io had been in their employ for seven years, but who is stated to have en active recently in connection with the Workers&apos; Union.    The  master s dealt with by officers of the Ministry of Munitions who found  the rm somewhat unaccommodating., but succeeded in effecting a settlement. has since been reported however that the firm have now given a  number men of military age notice to leave.   There has been a strike of some hundreds of men at the Llandulas imestone quarries which is of somewhat serious nature owing to the fact iat furnaces which are of great national importance depend on their work. 1th the assistance of Messrs. J. R, Clynes, M.P.jjwho directed the local epresentative; of the Trade Union to confer with the Ministry  of Munitions partial settlement has been effected   As a result of the recent Boilermakers&apos; strike on the Mersey  a meeting  held on Sunday last to hear the report of the Executive.   It  wasanounced that nearly all the grievances at Cammell Lairds had beensttled;   that standard ships are to be considered as Government  work;sd that other outstanding grievances would be adjudicated within  the nextwtnight.   The men seemed very satisfied with what had been  done, butecided to hold a further meeting on August 11th.(Omitted.)  end F,  Thome II.P.
                           II    DISPUTES  The number and  importance of  the  disputes that have been reported ing the week have both  declined.  The Ministry  of Munitions reports thirteen disputes none of which cf any great importance  and only two of which involve points of erest   &apos; The first  of these latter  is at the Stobie Steel Company ston-on-Tyne)  where the  firm has not only refused to meet the TradeIon representatives, but has been trying to induce the men to leave ir own Union for  another     This attitude has caused great bitterness. re ha3 also been  a  threat of a  strike at Messrs. Bleriot&apos;s Aircraft kg.  The men were  asked  why they did not first refer the matter to itration and replied that arbitration proceedings were unduly prolonged that a cessation of work always brought about a speedier settlement.  The Shipyard  Labour Department reports seventy cases of dispute, ut half these as  usual  coming from  the Clyde.   Eight of the number ulted in stoppages  of yrork which were not of serious consequence ever and twenty one were  successfully settled, the greater part by icers of the Department.    The  general position in this industry is ted to be normal c  The Army Contracts Department reports three new cases of dispute, e of which  are  of importance.    Eleven cases previously reported hive yet been settled.  The General Union of  Textile  Workers has decided to make an lic&amp;tion to the Committee on Production for an 85/ increase on pre- rates.   It is estimated that  this application will affect 55000 ratives.    In the alternative the Union is prepared to accept a urn to full working hours.  Clothing operatives ere asking for ances in most parts o   the country.   In the East End there have beenlumber of partial  stoppages among the Russian Jews, caused by the ire of the men  to take  part in  demonstrations of protest against the itary service convention  with the Russian Government.  Nine new  disputes are reported by the Statistics Department none which are of importance and most.of which involve wages questions.  The Committee on  Production during the past week heard tv/elve es in London and  eight  in Scotland.   Kone of the cases heard inidon were of general application, though one affected plumbers loyed in Shipyards  on the ?/ear, Tyne, Tees, and Hartlepool districts.ree of the cases heard at  Glasgow yrere general applications for/ances in wages  made by  a  number of  Unions and affecting the)ttish Steel Makers&apos; Yteges Association, West of Scotland Iron Steelmders&apos; Association, and the National Light Castings Ironfoundersrieration.\ \
iQ: HorthCoastarrow     The general tihe on the Clyde Is at the moment one ofquiet.   With the exception of a few drillers at John Browns,practically all the stragglers after the holidays havereturned to work-   Unrest centres around Mclvianus, whoseenergy since his return to Glasgow has been remarkable.   Incommon with&apos; the other ex-deportees.he has beenYM^fundscollected in the district, though these are now exhausted,and has been occupying himself in the attempt tc organise ageneral strike in the A.S.E. on the question of there-employment of the ex-deportees.   In pursuance of thisobject he has visited various parts of the country andclaims to have received promises of support from the shopstewards at Barrow and Sheffield, provided he can persuadethe Clyde to take the first step.   This he has so farfailed to do, nor does it appear probable that any actionwill be taken, if takenof Shop Stewards, whichAugust 18th and 19th, and over which KcManus will himselfpreside.-     From Lanarkshire it is reported that the Miners1 Unionhas resolved upon a general one day strike in the district,as a protest against profiteering.     The centre of interest in Newcastle, where anti pacifistfeeling Is strong h s centred round the conference ofSoldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Delegates, held on Saturday, whichproved a hopeless failure.   Apart from this, attentioncentres chiefly on the food question.   The hope isgenerally expressed that the recommendations of theCommissioners on Industrial Unrest will be carried out, butconfidence in Lord Rhondda appears if anything to haveincreased.     At an aggregate meeting of the local A.S.E. held atNewcastle, a resolution against payment by results was parsedunanimously.   A similar meeting held at South Shields wontso far as to recommend the abolition of all piece work onthe Tyne.     The position at Barrow is outwardly normal, but therestlessness y/hich has been/notable in the district seemsto be on the increase.   The chief grievances at the momentare the recent av/ard in the Engineering Trade, the withholdingof the railway vouchers which are usually issued for theholidays and the treatment which the Clyde reportees have  &apos;received.     In Cumberland the unrest among the coalminors hasspread to the iron-ore miners, who are also threatening tocease work.at all, before the Conferenceis to be held at Manchester on i shireCheshire.kshire.     The position in this area is normal again.    Thediscontent with the Engineers&apos; award has largely subsided.     Although among the Engineers in Yorkshire feeling inregard to the a ard is very bitter, and several  resolutionshave been passed against it at .H.S.E. meetings,  the chief-unrest is still to be found in the textile centres, wherethe operatives have decided to start a demand for aconsiderable advance of wages as distinct from bonusallowances.     There are no indications of immediate strikes, however,among either class of workers, and the position  on the wholeis satisfactory.   This is chiefly to be attributed to th-fact that substantial reductions in the prices of meat,  fishand vegetables have taken place and that difficulties inconnection viizh obtaining coal have been removed.Elands.The position in the Midlands is very quiet.
      The  situation  in London is  saiisfaotory.   The  chief  interest still centres  in food prices and profiteers, and various  ad hoc [nestings  have  been  held,  including  the  important demonstration of the  Co-operative Societies  in Hyde  Park on  Sunday.   The various&apos;peaoe societies have had  a  very  active  week, but though not subjected to the same treatment  as  the  Conference of ^orkQen&apos;s and Soldiers1 delegates (which  is reported  in section IV, Press Opinion)  have met with but  little success.      At ;7ool?/ich the situation is said  to be more settled than it has  been  for many months.      The,Shop  Stewards held a meeting on the  9th at which satis- faction was expressed with  the meeting  whioh Dr. Addison  addressed, and  at whioh it was announced that  arrangements had  been  made  for the  Shop  Stewards to attend before  the  Chief Superintendent to dismiss disputes.  The Shop Stewards have also requested  that  they may  be kept informed of shortages of skilled labour  when  thef  occur so that they may help to  transfer skilled hands from shops which are  temporarily Slack.  The  object  of this  offer is  no doubt the avoidance of further dilution.      fee  agitation among  the  Russian-Jewish population over the Military  Service (Convention with Allied Powers) Bill is  attaining considerable proportions.   The Secretary of the Foreign Jews Protection Committee, Abraham Bezalsi,  is the most prominentfigure in the movement.   Several important meetings  have  been  held,and  the policy to be adopted may be described shortly as  one ofrefusing to return to Russia without wives and families.   It Isanticipated that the Government will not be in a position to effe^rc the  transfer of so large a body,of people,  and not desiring toettaoA the Russian Government, will refrain from resort fo compulsion.      There had been a rapid extension of the unrest among  thecolliery workers,  th* increase of which, In this area, has beennoted in these reports during the last month.   The stoppages ofwork which have occurred  (referred to in Section I) involved about12,000 men, a settlement has now been effected by the good officeof Sir Richard Re-dmaytie.  Apart from the declared grievance inconnection with these strikes the trouble 1B no doubt partly dueto bitterness against the policy of e*%4djatf out tb&amp; miners,  Yerynumerous resolutions of protest have1 been^ftrrWT against thispolicy and the pacifist bodies rxxfti&amp;ne actively to make use  oftheir opportunities.
-i and      The initiatory meetings of these hodies were held at a     &quot; number&apos;of centres on Sunday the 29th July,  The gatherings in      London,  Swansea, and Newcastle, were the scenes of somewhat      violent hostile demonstration.  The action of the group which      was responsible for the meetings has been generally condemned&quot;^&quot;      in the daily Press of the 30th instant with the exception of      the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Daily News&quot;, which criticise the      taotics of the opposition with some asperity.  The latter      paper characterizes the attack on the meeting as &quot;one of the      greatest scandals that has disgraced this country since the      War began&quot;.  Several journals are of opinion that the      Governmont should have taken action to prevent the meetings. ,      The labour papers of the week were published before tho      meetings were held, and were almost unanimous in prophesying      overwhelming success.  Their comments on the actual happenings      will be  included in next week&quot;s report.           It  was anticipated that these meetings would be attended      and addressed by the delegates of the Russian Council of      Workers  and Soldiers delegates.  With reference to them the      &quot;Labour  Leader&quot; (26th July)  wrote:-  &quot;They will then have an      &quot;opportunity of realising how much in sympathy are the workers      &quot;of this country with their  Russian comrades,  how identical      &quot;are the aims and aspirations of the democracies of both      &quot;countries,  and how anxious  we are to bring our Government      &quot;into line with the Peace formula of the Russian Provisional      &quot;Government.&quot;           Among other papers,  the &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot;      (July 26th)  reports that  the Executive of the  Labour Party has      repudiated the Leeds conference,  and advised affiliated      societies  to refrain from joining the Yforkers  and  Soldiers      Councils,  and the &quot;New Statesman&quot; (July 28th)  has a vitriolic      paragraph  describing the  organisers of the  &quot;so-called Workers&apos;      and Soldiers1  Council&quot;  as &quot;the Leninites of Britain&quot;.Criticism   25T71              &quot;Common Sense&quot;  (28th July)  has an article criticising the         Government control of the manufacturer.   It says &quot;ResponsibleTernmont. &quot;managements are  sick and  weary of it all.   The men are in         &quot;precisely the same  mood.  It  will be borne,  because any         &quot;protest  at this juncture  would be construed as unpatriotic         &quot;Leading  men who-have devoted  large portions  of their time to         &quot;this and that advisory committee^,  whose  reports never come tw        &quot;fruition,  are chafing at  it.   Many firms  do not know how they         &quot;stand.   In some cases &quot;balance sheets have  not been completely         &quot;made out for two years...... The skilled  clerks have mftre than         &quot;their work to d8 to keep even with Government returns;;;.,         &quot;(There is a feeling  that  the whole thing  is overdone...*.&quot;             The  lack  of  continuity  In  the management  of  administrative       Departments  of Government  is criticised  in  a letter  to which       prominence is  given in  &quot;Common  Sense&quot;(20th  July).  The writer       also  alleges that the employment of business men  to  posts       under the Government has proved a failure.Food         Tho  measures promised by the Food Controller  have met       with  general approval.  The  &quot;Morning Post&quot;  (July  27th)       however doubts whether  the proposals will result  in  economy       whilo holding  that they are  likely to cause paralysis in trade.     The agitation against profiteering continues and theprofits of successful Companies are published by all theLabour press with appropriate commonts.  A good instance ofthis method is found in the &quot;Herald&quot; (28-ch July) which,  afterprinting a cummary of the report, of Messrs *  Pumssc mCompany w?iJ;oct &quot;Notice the paltry eui. of  40.000 sojfor the mer wLo rie%*  life and l:.mj to &quot;earn the 1-/10 r.-.profits for frrn^ss,  withy. and C o:ran,.;.    Wo aug^ocour friends of the Seaman and firemen&quot;s Union that it;dis .iign
  time they demanded a 100 per cent increase in wages......&quot;       The policy of amalgamation of existing unions continues. - popular..- &quot;&quot;Reynolds&quot; (22nd July), the &quot;Labour Leader&quot;  (26th July) ano the &quot;Herald&quot; (28th July) give prominence to  the recently formed &quot;Kational Union of General Workers&quot;  which covers seven Unions (including the General Workers  and the Dockers) and has a membership of half a million.  The &quot;Herald&quot; (28th July) states that a olose working  arrangement between the Shipwrights and the Boilermakers has  practically been concluded.  The &quot;Pioneer&quot; (27th July)  reports that the Railway clerks Union (Sic) with a  membership of 50000 decided at its annual meeting &quot;to  approaoh the national Union of Railwaymen  with a possible  view to fusion&quot;.       The Textile journals (Cotton Factory Times July 27th  and Yorkshire Factory Times July 26th) both support an  energetic movement 66&apos; compel all operatives to join the Unions.       The problem of the position of women in industry after  the War formed the subject of a conference in London, at which  Miss Mary MaoArthur presided, and which is reported in the  &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot;(3Cth July). The necessity for male an1-  female workers to keep together in order to avoid the  competition of unorganised women was emphasised.  Dealing with  this matter the &quot;Railway Review&quot; (July 27th) writes:- &quot;With  &quot;the inorease of the number of women employed doing nen,s as  &quot;well as women&quot;s work, there is the problem of demobilisation  &quot;to be faced when the war ends, and the future means of  &quot;livelihood of women who mast depend on themselves to be  &quot;provided for&quot;.  The &quot;Daily Record&quot; (July 21st), in a leader  &quot;Women and Trade Unionism&quot;, writes:- &quot;We must see to it that  &quot;the women have an abundanoe of suitable employment. That is  &quot;our greatest after-the-war problem snd it brooks no delay&quot;.       The &quot;Clarion&quot; (2uly 28th) has an article entitled &quot;After  tho V/ar&quot; in the course of which it writes:- &quot;There is no  &quot;obstaolS to the full employment of all our people at high  &quot;wages in peaoe time  but the spirit cf profiteering.....   ....  &quot;Waives must continually rise and unemployment need never occur1!       The &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; (July 20th) prints a leading  article on the Whitlay Report, which it commends to the  workmen as a measure of substantial progress.       In the &quot;Hew Statesman&quot; (July 28th) there is an important  article on &quot;Labour Unrest&quot; based on the Reports of the&quot;Unrest  Commissioners.  The general tenour of the article may be  judged from the last paragraph: &quot;Reports of the eight  &quot;Commissions, presantly to be published as a Parliamentary  &quot;paper, will be found to dwell on many minor grievances, by  &quot;no means adequately represented In the official summary.  It  &quot;is in their specific recommendations that the twenty four  &quot;Commissioners are least helpful to the Government,  but  &quot;effective reforms require thought, and for this Mr.  Lloyd  &quot;George left them no time.  The Commissioners are insistent  &quot;that something drastic needs to be done.  The thinking has  now     fl  to take place at Whitehall&quot;.       The &quot;  Clarion&quot; (July 28th) writes:- &quot;The solemn farce of  &quot;enquiring into the causes of Labour Unrest  has once  more been  &quot;played, and the result is just nothing&quot;,   &quot;Common Sense&quot;  (July 28th) takes an opposite view in an article  headed  &quot;Governments Great Opportunity&quot;; It says;-  &quot;v/e warmly wej^ono  the- publication of this Reporti.....l7e  trust that  thy  Cabinet, will not pigeon hole  these  recommendations, but .that
they will be freely circulated throughout  every GovernmentDepartment and that those Departments having dealingsclireot or indirect with L-bcur will bear them constantlyin mind&quot;.-     The &quot;Labour Leader (July 26th) considers that theReport may be useful to the Government in  coming to adecision as to the amended form in which they will presentthe Munitions of War Bill to the Rouse.  The &quot;Herald&quot;(July 28th) concludes an.article on the subject as follows:-&quot;The point is&apos; to put the&apos;:&quot;-wrong to rights.  And that would&quot;mean insight, sympathy and statesmanship.- For our own&quot;part we look for these and other 30od things to the&quot;workers themselves rather than to Downing Street&quot;.     The summary of the reports of the Unrest Commissionshas met with the general approval of the Daily Press,     The Arrail Griffen Miners Lo *ye has decided to supportthe Merthyr and Dowlads Miners&quot; protest in favour of peaceby negotiations. At the same meeting it was &quot;agreed by ahuge majority&quot; to refuse to pay any more income tax,  &quot;Itwas stated that the Blaina District has already decided&apos;&quot;to do this as well as adopting a &quot;nova tool policy on the&quot;comb-out&quot;..(MerthyrePioneer, July 28th).  The Local JointCommittee of  Miners&quot; Lod^e of the Afan Valley is said tohave passed similar resolutions.     The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; (July 28th) reports that the SouthWales Miners  Executive has called a special conference forAugust 2nd to consider the action necessary to ascertain theopinion of organised labour generally, on  the subject ofpeace,     The Miners1 Federation of Great Britain at theirAnnual Conference at Glasgow passed a resolution that minesana&quot; minerals  should be owned and controlled by the State(Glasgow Herald, July 23rdh -     &quot;Common Sense&quot; (July 28th) reports a  shortage of 4C0CCworkers1 houses in Sheffield,-     &quot;The latest enterprise at Port Sunlight is a collegefor the training of Messrs. Levers1 staff.,1a .,The staff istrained in the firmTs time;&apos;instead of in  the evening in&apos;the employee1 s time..,,      The college staff number 28&quot;,-(Cotton Factory Times, July 27th.)  This is an interestingand important development.     The &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; (July 27th) has  an articleon Welfare work, pointing- out that, in this matter,  theootton industry is behind, the times, and indicating themethods of progress which Bhould be adopted.
      In Part IT of the Report for the week ending 18th July it was noted that a Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World had been formed in England,; and in the Report for the following week the Pro-German activity of that organisation in America was mentioned-.  In the &quot;V/ostninster Gazette&quot; of 27th July, a short paragraph appeared stating that the Commonwealth Government of Australia had passed a Bill suppressing the organisation in that Colony.      The Headquarters  of the Industrial Workers of the World are in Chicago.   The organisation was founded in 1905 and has been important in the industrial history of the United States of America on account of  its militant quality, rather than of the number of its members, which were never alleged to exceed 90,000. At an early stage the  orthodox Socialist members who followed Daniel Deleon, one of  the founders of the Industrial Workers of the V/orld. broke away  from the parent stem and formed a separate branch known as the ^eleOnites1, whose method of political activity is the &quot;Don&apos;t Vote&quot; campaign.  In England this section is represented by the  Independent Workers of Great Britain who adhere mainly to the Socialist Labour Party and are making considerable progress  in Glasgow whence they publish their organ &quot;The Socialist&quot;.  Their headquarters in Anorioa are at Detroit.      The British section of the Industrial Workers cf the \7orld Is closely connected with the Chicago branch, and it is important that their views and practices should be known.  The principles of the Sooiety are the immediate  embarrassment of the Capitalist owner in every possible way, \vith the ultimate object of the overthrow of Capitalism.  To this end they employ the strike on every possible occasion, and a pamphlet issued in England, entitled &quot;All I7age Slaves may Start Now&quot; and written by E.L, Pratt, clearly sets forth what may be termed the legitimate methods ef the Industrial Workers of the World,  Among these is the &quot;Opportune Strike&quot; which is described as follows:-  &quot;This means that workers could go  on strike whenever it seemed that such action would take the Capitalists at a  special disadvantage:- for instance; 13hen they had work that must be done immediately&quot;. The fifth method is the &quot;Final Universal Strike&quot;, in which all workers remain within  the industrial institutions, lock the employers out, commandeer the plant, and &quot;soo give the parasites&quot;of labour a  chance of  beooming useful members of Sooiety,&quot;      Methods whioh may be described as illegitimate are also advocated, and have been proved to be employed.  In the &quot;Industrial I Worker&quot; for  November 1916 there is an article, justifying sabotage and destruction of the means of production,  on the ground that this is an effective means of embarrassment of the Capitalist  I employer..  In a paper, published  and distributed in England by an Immigrant American member, among  other methods the following were advocated:-   Sugar placed in petrol tanks of motor engines; Emery powder in the bearings of delicate machinery;  sand in the axle boxes of rolling  stock on railways;  Croton oil in the soup at public refections;   and soap in the boilers of steam engines.      The history of the Industrial Workers of the World in Australia has established that methods of sabotage even more drastic are  employed.   A series of cases of arson were proved against its  members in which the  damage done is alleged to have been   500,000.  Both  in Australia and in America members hare been guilty of deliberate murder  in the interests of the aims  of the Society.  In his judgment convicting those on their Trial  for arson in Sydney, Judge Pring, who passed sentence, said that the revelations afforded by the evideaace demonstrated that the JC .17,17.. was an association of  criminals of the worst type, and was a hotbed of crime.  He hoped that strong and drastic measures would be taken to uproot the Association.  The Government,  evidently acting on this advice, has now suppressed the  Sooiety in
 Australia,      In England though the I.:7.7. is probably not organically connected with the bodies such as the I,LtP,, the ftoeGonscription Fellowship, Union of Democratic Control, the Shop Stewards&quot;Committees, and otner pacifist and syndicalist associations, its membership is believed to include individual members of these bodies, and every endeavour is now being made to inaugurate new branches of theSociety, and to join forces with other revolutionary or pacifist organisations.  A considerable element of sirength is found in the Russian and Polish population of the Bast Snd of London.  The movement cannot be said as yet to be one of serious moment in England but it Is unquestionably one. to whinh close attention must be paid.
