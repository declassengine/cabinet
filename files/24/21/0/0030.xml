WAS CJ3IHET.ALLIED COlIFBRBflCE .AT PABIS.   25th g 26th July 1917.Opinions of generals Sir W.Robertson,   ffoch and Oadorna.            Sir William Robertson1 s point  of view.       GS1TERAL SIR WILLIAM ROBERTSOH stated that  in his  opinion the Allies are making very bad use of  their mon as  there arc 600,000 rationsires at Salonioa as against some 400,000  of tho enemy.   He added that in view of tho  facts that  tho allied forces at SALOtfICA were able last spring to constitute a reserve sufficient both for offensive purposes and to watch the situation in Greece, that the situation in GTeoco IS now satisfactory, that sinoe the Spring Venizelist troops have joined the allies,  and that the Greek army is now being reconstituted as a further reinforoement,  the allied force at Salonica is stronger than  is necessary for purely defensive purposes if it is properly commanded  and  adequate preparations for defence are made.   Sir W.Robertson is  further of opinion that an offensive at Salonioa has no practical advantage unless it is combined with a main Russo-Rumanian attack on Bulgaria from tho north, and that at present there is little prospect  of such an attack taking place.       The British Government,  in view of the situation  In AsiaMinor, Where their forces, failing active Russian support, willle exposed to tho whole weight of the Turkish Armies,  find itnecessary immediately to reinforce their army on the frontier ofPalesiihe by one division and some heavy artillery,  in order  thatthe utmost pressure may be exerted on the Turks and they may beprevented from concentrating against the British army inMesopotamia which it is difficult to  roinforoo.   They proposeto transfer,  therefore, one division end some  heavy artilleryfrom  Salonioa to Palestine at once,  and suggest that, asVeniselist divisions become available,  they should be utilisedto relieve French or British divisions now on the  front,  so as  toconstitute a general reserve available either  for  an offensiveagainst Bulgaria,  should it later become practical,  or fortransfer to another theatre of war.       The news from Russia is not good during the last few days,and therefore it is more important than ever that the Britishposition should he assured in Asia.    C BE %.G.T. 153Q.           Generals Fooh and Cadorna^s point of view.       Keeent events in Greece have improved our situation inthe Balkans hut will only procure us a reinforcement of effectivesunder oonditions not yet determined and at a date relatively41 *tant (beginning of 1918),
      Consequently we  should examine :      The plan for the immediate action based upen our presentmeans.      The ulterior plan of action based upon Greek co-operation.      IMMEDIATE PLAgOg ACTION:   For military, political,  endmoral reasons we mast maintain the conquered ground,  ceverGreece end the conanunicstione ef the Italian Army with  theAdriatic.      We must also be prepared to assume the offensive  in caneof an important Bus so-Rumanian success.      The first of these obligations defines the importance ofthe effectives to be maintained in the East, these effectivescannot at present bo reduced owing to the extent of the frontand owing to-the difficulty of the communications which preventthe rapid movement of  -reserves.   The fact that the Army ofthe East is composed of heterogeneous troops, ie suffering fromlack of materiel, has formations which are notxg to strengthand is,  to a great extent, composed of tired troops makes itall the more important not to reduce the effectives at preaentin the East.      ULTERIOR PLAN OF ACTIONS  The utilisation of the Greekforces which will only enter&quot;*into line at the beginning of1918,  depends essentially upon the plan of action which it  isproposed to carry out in the Bast in 1918.      li no offensive action is contemplated those forces willbe able  to replace the Franco-British forces;   in the contrarycase they will provide the necessary troops for the attack*The coalition must decide this question of principle;   bfct itshould be noted that the opportunity may offer to liquidatethe question of the East by a decisive action,  and it thereforeappears  necessary to maintain the means of carrying this out.      The situation created by the latest German snccesees inGalioia gives even more value to the point of view exposed above.If the Germans should develop their advantage  and collect thenecessary troops, they may seek to obtain a decisive resultagainst  the armies of the East.      This hypothesis is in conformity with their tradition  ofobtaining at the end of the year an easy success,  the possibilityof this  absolutely prevents the reduction at the present momentof the troops at Saloniea.      The new British proposition can only he considered later,towards  the end of October when the situation  will have beencleared  up and will be stabilised *      This Bote sums up the opinion ef General Cadorna and thatof General Foch.
