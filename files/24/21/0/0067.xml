9IPERATIONS.SECRET.From :- General Ballard,                Roumania.To      C,I,G,S,War Office.July 28th, 1917B.A.677.  .        The situation here is very variable and may turnout very bad, or fairly good.   The^decisive questiontherein is whether Russian Government can assert authorityand whether troops will obey,   The Russians here arccalm at present.    Many officers consider that theretreat in Galicia will prove to be a blessing in wakingup the country to the ? real situation.   The Governmenthas already instituted the death penalty and has forbiddenmeetings.   At present the court which gives death sentencemust include sildiers elected by regiments, and thisprovision reduces it to a farce; but it is understood, thatif possible the provision will shortly be withdrawn.These were the obvious first steps.-    If these can beenforced, then ether stops towards the establishment ofdiscipline will be easier.    Russian officers say thatthe riots in Petrograd last week have sickened everybodyof anarchists$ and that the Cadet or moderate party isgaining strength daily.    However, it will be bitterlyopposed by Maximalists and anarchists, and there will bebloodshed,    The question is Y/hether the troops willremain steady until the Government can assert authority.This will be probably decided in the course of the next2 or 3 weeks.    If Government cannot enforce disciplineby strong measures the troops will not fight of theirown accord,.   Whether they remain in their trenches fora few months because they arc (groups apparently omitted)will desert as s&apos;*on as cold weather sets in.         Major Keyes has just returned from tour in the9th Army,    His report will follow later.   He confirmsthe above as regards the 40th Corps,  where he founddiscipline hopelessly bad.

Situation is worse.I am informed &quot;by Russianoperations bureau that little fighting had taken place,but 7th and 8th Armies are still talking politicsinstead ef obeying orders or fighting,   The soldiershave passed a resolutien that Russian advance atbeginning ef July was instigated ty Russian officerstc permit of Germans breaking Russian line.     Thispolitical talk will prebaVly spread to the 9th Army,which is already full of pr&amp;paganda and in the worststate possible.    This would involve a general retire-ment behind the PRUTH.      In a cable to the ForeignOffice British Minister here has dealt with thatquestion,     Acknowledge receipt,.
