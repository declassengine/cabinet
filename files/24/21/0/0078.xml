Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.DRW/012.S^/   Weekly Report on Rumania.  XII*            (July 31.  1917.)     More Information on the Cabinet Crisis.     It is now possible to give further details and, in some casescorrections of the account given in my last report of the passingof the Reform Bill through the Rumanian Parliament and the con-sequent Cabinet crisis.    During the discussion in the Chamberlasting for nearly three weeks on the general principles of theBill speeches were made by nearly every prominent deputy.   Thenew Labour Party, especially Mr. Diaioandy,  Dr. Lupu and Mr.Bazilescu, played the chief part in the criticisms directedagainst the Bill.   They objected to it, not because thev areopposed to the reforms in themselves, but because they declaredthat they were unreal ones and had been brought forward merelyas a political move on the part of Mr.  Bratianu in order to ensurehimself against the futurev  . Mr.  Bazilescu declared that hefavoured not merely the  graduated scheme of expropriation of large1200 acres.    Further he demanded that  the  great  industries  of theconsequently will be safeguarded as far as possible)  should benationalised.   The Labour party further demanded votes for women,(l)  The remaining 2,500,000 acres (of the 5 million to be divided    among the peasants) are taken from Drown and municipal lands*    The Chamber expressed its warm gratitude to:King Ferdinand for    his voluntary surrender of the Crown lands.obtained,  but  the  entire  expropriation  of all properties  of abovecountry (most of which are  in  the  hands  of the Liberal party and
   nqual franchise  for the  Senate  and  Chamber alike and other sweeping  I reforms.       Criticisms  from other  quarters of the Chamber were of a   different  kind.   Most  of the big landholders  showed a praiseworthy   enthusiasm for the  reforms  which were  to  deprive them of the greater  part of their estates.    Among  the  names  of those who spoke in   favour of  the reforms are to be found  such great boyar names as  Branccveanu, Ghica,  Cantacuzino, Bogdan,  Iliescu-Olt and others.  The only three strongly  reactionary speeches v/ere made by the Con-  servative  deputies  Cincu, Chica-Comune^ti and  Cuza.       On June 12/25  the Chamber  voted that the  Bill should be taken  into consideration  by a  majority of 129 to 2.    The Labour party,  9 members  of which  v/ere  present, abstained from voting as they  declared   that thoy did  not wish to obstruct the reforms and hoped  that in the consideration of them in detail their amendments would  be accepted.   Thic,  however, did not  take place when the detailed  discussion of the reforms as affecting articles 19,  57 and 67 of  the  Constitution was concluded  on the following day.    Consequently on the  vote on the third reading of the Bill  10  members of the Labour party  voted against, together  with 4  Conservatives.    There was one abstention  (Bazilescu) and  the Bill was carried by 150 out of 144.       Next  day it was taken  to the Senate  where  it was subjected to  some violent criticism on the part  of  the extreme reactionary Con-  servative  elements  in that  House.    Specially  strong speeches were  made against it  by  Messrs.  Argetoianu  and Gradisteauu,  followers  of  the late Mr. Filipescu.   In spite  of  this opposition,  however, the  Bill was caJried on July 4  by a large  majority,  79 voting in favour  and only 5 Conservatives against.       It is interesting to note  that in both Chamber and Senate aj] large number sb$  members  were absent.    In the Chamber out of 184  members 144 voted;  there was one abstention; 4  deputies  present in  the country did  not attend; 8 were  absent abroad  or  through illness;
and 26 had remained behind in Wallachia under enemy occupation.Among these 26 are included such well-known German09hiIs as Carp,C.C Arion, Professor Sterc, Mr. Fleva and others.   In the Senate34 members were present out of 153,  2 did not attend,  6 were abroadand 25 (including 4 V/allachian bishops) had remained behind in theoccupied territory.   Among these were Mr. Marghiloman and Mr* 9.^.9,Cantacuzino.     Immediately after the passing of the Reform Bill in thoSenate on July 4 Mri Gradisteanu made a fierce attack on the PrimeMinister.   He accused him of having brought Rumania into the warvyithout making proper military preparations or preparing the countryfrom the moral point of view for the contest on which it wasembarking.   Further he had tolerated corruption and abuses of allkinds and had put incompetent and disloyal persons in charge ofimportant poets.   Mr. Bratianu made a dignified but not altogethersatisfactory reply to these charges.   They aroused the indignationof some of his supporters, and Mr. Suculescu at once got up anddeclared that he and his Liberal colleagues could not  listen to suchcharges against their chief without  replying to them.    He thereforedeclared that he would move a vote of confident in Mr.  Bratianu&apos;spast administration.   This vote of  confidence it wa3 of courseimpossible for Mr. Take Ionescu to support.    Ho explained that hewas perfectly vailing to take his share  of the responsibility foreverything that had been done since  his entry into the CoalitionCabinet last December, but for the previous policy of the Bratianugovernment ho could take no such responsibility.   He very mu&amp;hregretted the violent attack which had Been made by Mr,.  Gr&amp;disteanu,but he could not approve of this attack being exploited by the Liberalparty for their own advert isomenx.   Tho 10 Conservatives presenttherefore abstained from voHing on the motion of confidence whichwas carried unanimously by the 54 Liberal senators present.
     In last wee-k!s report the- Cabinet crisis arising out of this yote was dealt with.   At the time it was written it appeared that, as Mr- Bratianu had refused to accept the. demands Mr. Take loncscu had made to the King, there was no possibility of a National Govern- ment being formed.    It will bo remembered that Mr.  Take Ionescu had demanded an equal distribution of portfolios between the Liberal and Conservative parties, the resignation of Mr. Yintila 3r^tianu (War) ana Mr. Constantinescu (interior), and the withdrawal of Mr. BrStianu from the post either of Prime Minister or of Minister of Foreign Affairs and his replacement in CAP or other of these posts by Mr. Take Ionescu himself.   This,  it was understood,  was a sine qua non of the Conservatives1 participation in the now government and, in spite of the urgent persuasions of the King, there soemed no possibility of an arrangement being reached.   However,  the sudden change in the military situation on the Russian front and the desperate situation in which the Russian retreat may involve Rumania rendered it impossible for Mr. take Ionescu to refuse hie support to the govern--ment of the country at ench a moment  of national peril.    Accordingly it wan announced on July 26 that the  Conservatives had agreed to takepart in the nowly constructed government ftith lose representation thanthey had originally claimed.   Moreover Mr.  Bratianu remains bothPrime Minister and  Minister fro Foreign Affairs;  his brother Vintiit indeed abandons his post of Minister  of War for that of Minister ofMunitions,  a new portfolio, and ie succeeded at the  War  Office by                  (1)General Iancovescu, politically a colourless person.  But most of,the Liberal members of the,Cabinet remain at their posts,  Mr.Constant inescu as Minister *^f the Interior,  Mr.  Buca ae  Minister of(1)   General  Iancoveecu, Boon after Rumania^ intervention in the war,     succeeded General  Iliescu a9 Secretary- general to the War Office.     Subsequently,  in October 1916, he was made Assistant to the Chief     if the General Staff.   He had been connected with operations     in the field and has had no part in political intrigues.
Public Instruction and several others.   The number of ConservativeMinisters in the Cabinet is nov; raised to 5 by the inclusion ofMr. itficolae Titulescu as Minister of Finance,   Another supporterof Mr. Take Ionescu, kr. Barbu Delavraneea (one of the leadingpoots and story-writers of modern Rumania and a sincere Rumanianpatriot who has been in turns Liberal and Conservative but is infact not a party politician) becomes Minister of Agriculture, Mr.Greceanu remains Minister of Public Y/orks, Dr. Istrati Ministerof Commerce and Industry  and Mr. Mihai Cantacusino Minister ofJustice.   The settlement is of course only a temporary onenecessitated by.the situation abroad.   Distrust of Mr. Bratianu&apos;8entourage is too deeply rooted both in the Conservative party andamong Mr. Take Ionescu&apos;s follov/ers for them to give any whole-hearted co-operation to a government which is still dominated byhis adherents.   It is true that to Mr. Take Ionescu is now assignedxthe post of &quot;Vicc-President of the Council of Ministers, a sort ofDeputy-Prime Minister, but the posts given to his followers do notallow of their playing very much part in the direction of affairs.However, any replacement of Mr. Bratianu for the moment seems out ofthe question;  not only is  .he the one man personally acceptable tothe King, but he possesses a large majority in both Houses ofParliament and, as a general election for the moment is out of thequestion, no government to which he was opposed could take office.     As for the feeling in the country it may be conjectured thatconsiderable anxiety will be caused by the Russian retreat and                             rabandonment of Bukovina, which in its turn will necessitate awithdrawal of Rumanian troops immediately after their recentsuccessful advance.   Parties in Parliament do not of course in theleast represent the people as a whole; the newly formed Labour Party,which consists in the main of honest and determined men,  has neitherthe leaders nor the political experience requisite to qualify forthe conduct of affairs.    At the same time it is clear that the
 feeling of the country must he strongly in favour of reforms for otherwise it is hard to say why ihe..aig landed proprietors in parliament should have been in such a hurry to agree to the sweeping expropriations proposed.     Rumania Irredenta.     In last report some account was given of the ferment among the population of Bessarabia.   Newspapers to hand show that the movement continues.   Prom May 25-30 (June 7-12) the first Congress of Bessarabian school teachers was held in Chisinau (Kishinyov). After Mass had. been celebrated in Rumanian the conference began its discussions and arrived at the following conclusions:  (l) &quot;Mol- davian&quot; schools should bo opened in the autumn in all the villages of Bessarabia where the majority is Moldavian.   (2)  Russian should only be taught in these schools to the pupils in their third year for about six hours a week.   (3)  Schools should also be opened in the towns in proportion to tho numbers of the &quot;Moldavian&quot; children.   (4)  Books are to be printed in the Latin alphabet (instead of Cyrillic).   (5)  The curriculum of these schools should be standardised with the Russian.   Other resolutionsprovide for the establishment of secondary schools in the towns;professorships in &quot;Moldavian&quot; Language, History and Literature atthe Universities of Odessa and Kiyev;  that primary instruction should be compulsory and free; that religious instruction inRumanian should he compulsory and that it should be given inRumanian to Moldavian pupils even in Russian schools.    On Juno4-17 the first Moldavian people&apos;s library was to be opened inBessarabia.    - Arrival of Transftlvanian Volunteers.     Very full accounts appear in the Rumanian press of the arrival of the Transilvanian volunteers for the Rumanian army described in last week&apos;s report.   Enthusiasm was very great everywhere,  and
                                                                Ithe newspapers  devote  columns to the  speeches made  on the  occasionof their  reception  and to the splendid possibilities opened up bythe co-operation  of these volunteers  with the Rumanian army.A.VT.A.L.     31/7/17.
