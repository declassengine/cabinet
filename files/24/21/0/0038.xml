if                    From Sir P. Cox, 25th July 1017.      (Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Secretary of State for India,                     with copy to Army Commander.)                        (Received 11 p.m.. 26th.)   2768.  Please see Secretary  of  State&apos;s telegram  of  4th July regardingMesopotamia Administration.   I had been  awaiting  instructions from  Government  of  India beforesubmitting my views.   On receiving the telegram I sent copy to Army Commander whose viewshad been called for by Chief of  the General Staff and he discussed it withme.  I gather that he saw no reason to alter views expressed in paragraph 12of my  telegram  T. 1049, dated  7th April,  and feared that  adoption ofSecretary of  States proposals would  mean division of authority prejudicialto military interests of force.   As regards  myself, the  views expressed  in  the  paragraph above  citedwere based on the experience cf the preceding   years.   The events of thepast  three months however, have caused me to modify them somewhat forthe following reasons :     Granted  that we  are  both  imbued  with the  fullest  desire  to-makegood assurance(s) which we have given to Government, yet in practice manydifficult questions  arise in  regard  to which there is room for  considerabledivergence of view as to what is  or is not in the  interests of Government orin harmony  with spirit of  their policy;  and even  in  our own particularsphere, neither Army Commander nor I can lay claim to infallibility.   1 amconsequently brought to opinion  that it would  be more satisfactory for HisMajesty&apos;s Government as well as  fairer to each of us that the former shouldreceive regular and frequent reports which will both keep them posted inregard to progress of their policy, and will incidentally enable them to satisfythemselves that  a just balance  is  being  maintained between military andpolitical  or  civil interests.  In  short,  as  regards question of report, I amentirely in favour of it, more  especialty in view of probability  that militarysituation during the coming winter  will preclude assembly of  the  proposedCommission as early as was  expected.   AB to question of my being given title of Civil Commissioner, I am notaware precisely what Army Commander&apos;s  views  are  on the point, but theywill  no  doubt be  given fullest  consideration.   With the  clear limitationimposed, I  do not  think my  appointment as such  need  prove any ineon-venience to  him while the civil administration will certainly benefit.  Inthis connection I hope it will  be conceded that in past three yeais, duringwhich I have endeavoured to  render loyal co-operation to five succeedingGeneral Officer Commanding&apos;s, there has been little evidence of any tendencyon my part to assert myself  unduly at  their expense, and I shall endeavourthat there is as little in future.   My sole concern is  that the civil and  political interests  of  Governmentshall be adequately safeguarded.   In regard to these interests whatever maybe my nominal title  or status,  vis-a-vis  the  Army  Commander,  and not-withstanding his supreme authority, the mere fact of my having been  herethroughout the period make it impossible that I  can  be divested completelyof personal responsibility whether present or ultimate.
