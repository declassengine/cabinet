hi. Document is the ^tT -* *&quot;* **-** mj^fm      -*JCONFIDENTIALV\X    MEMORANDUM  ON  COMMERCIAL  POLICY.     IT is, I think, generally agreed that after the war His Majesty&apos;s Government will have to take a more active part in shaping the commercial policy of this country.   The Committee appointed by  the  Prime  Minister, and presided  over  by Lord Balfour  of Bnrleigh, is considering this all-important subject.  The questions which that Committee will examine are laid down in the terms of reference as follows:      (a.) What industries  are essential to the  future  safety  of the  nation, and  what           steps should be taken to maintain or establish them ?     (b.) What steps should be taken  to recover home and foreign trade lost during the           war and to secure new markets ?     (c.) To what extent, and by what means, the resources of the Empire should and           can be developed ?     (d.) To what extent, and by what means,  the sources of supply within the Empire           can be prevented from falling under foreign control ?     It seems, therefore, that this Committee is primarily  concerned  with the internal organisntion of the.United Kingdom and Inter-Imperial trade.     Sub-heading (b), however, may be taken to be sufficiently wide to cover the whole range of foreign commercial policy; and while we must  admit that that policy will depend mainly  on the reorganisation of our internal machinery, 1 cannot help thinking that a certain  corner of that very wide field which concerns  the Foreign  Office almost exclusively viz., organisation.and  consolidation  of British communities  abroad will remain unexplored.  I therefore venture to put forward a  few conclusions at which I have arrived after a careful examination of what seems to be the only example of a real national commercial policy in existence,  viz., that  of Germany before  the war.     Before considering this aspect ,of the question, it is essential that the  subject of  commercial  policy should  -first  be viewed as  a   whole,  in  order  to  appreciate more clearly the important part which organisation  abroad, one of its constituent elements, plays in relation to  the rest of the  fabric.   I  have therefore  attempted  to explain the  four or  five main  factors  of  German commercial^ policy which,  while disclaiming any intention to advocate  the adoption in  their entirety of the principles upon which they, rest, I nevertheless think deserve our most careful consideration.     That policy may, for  the  purpose of this memorandum, be conveniently divided into five parts :          1. The co-ordination  of industry and  financs  at home.         2. The cartel system.         .3. Transport arrangements.         4. Shipping-policy.         5. The organisation of-&apos; Deutschtum  &quot; abroad.    &quot;There are, of.course,.in addition,  many  subsidiary elements besides, but these may&apos; besaid to he the five great pillars upon whi^h  the whole German structure rests.     I  u ill  noAv take tliese points in  their natural prder.                    X-Go-ordinationpf Finance atizd Industry.     Riesser, in his standard work on  German  banking, says  : &quot; The  skirmishes of the political advance  posts are fought  out on financial  grounds.&quot;   As the basis  of all industrial and commercial expansion in modern times is finance, we must  begin by an. analysis of the fundamental  difference  between  the  German and British systems  of finan.ce iin their , relation to industry.   Briefly  put,  the  German system stands for concentration, combination, co-ordination, and co-operation, dominated and controlled by the policy of the Government; the  British  stands for  individualism  and laissez-faire. This difference is not due, in the first  instance, to  deliberate forethought on either side,      &quot;[769]                                                     ^        B
but to the special circumstances in which the economic development of each country hasbeen allowed to run its natural course.  Each has followed the line of least resistance.  InGreat  Britain, the first industrial State, industries  grew up  and prospered rapidly, andconsequently became less dependent upon financial assistance.   The system of bankingin this country has thus come to confine itself chiefly to what is known as strictly banking-business,  ie., deposit banking.  Germany, on  the  other hand, entered the  field ofindustrial and commercial  competition  several  decades  later,  and  found  herselfconfronted with British predominance all the world over.  The only possible means ofdefeating such a powerful  competitor  was for her to organise and concentrate hereconomic forces in such a way as to constitute them  into  an effective fighting weapon.No healthy industrial growth was possible in Germany without strong financial backing.From the very first, therefore, the German conception of  the proper function of a bankhad to differ widely from the orthodox canons of British finance.    In Germany the general poverty of the country did  not lend  itself  to  depositbanking as a profitable business, so  that at a very early stage of the modern industrialmovement the banks began to associate themselves with the promotion of every kindof enterprise, and to encourage exportation.  The idea of State or bankers&apos; participationin industrial enterprise is not of German but of French origin,  but, like so many otherthings, was  pirated by the Germans, and brought by them to  its present high state ofdevelopment.  .    We need not trace the history of German banking further back than 1870 to gaina  correct idea of that formidable piece  of mechanism  which formed  the basis ofGermany&apos;s commercial policy before the present war.   The flush of victory in 1870 gaveto Germany the first impetus to commercial  and  industrial expansion,  which hassince  never  ceased to grow.   Capital  had  to be  created and   industries broughtinto existence with a feverish heat.  One of the great defects of this artificial hot-houseplant one  from which  Germany  continues  to suffer is the insufficiency  of  hercirculating liquid  capital in  comparison with the immensity of her enterprises.   Thebanks began to engage in a multitude of operations, financial, industrial, and commercial,assuming&apos;risks which in&apos;this country would never have been considered legitimate fromthe bankers&apos; point of view.   It was not of deliberate choice that  the German banksadopted this policy.  It was forced on them by the circumstances of the moment, withthe result that even to-day the industrial evolution of Germany marches more rapidlythan the formation of capital.   From  the very first  the  German banks  aimed at thecreation and concentration of capital.   The German  banking world experienced manyvicissitudes during the first  twenty years after the war of  1870, but the concentratedbanking organisation of to-day may be said to date from about the year 1890.  In thatyear a wave of financial depression passed over  Germany, and the crisis which  ensuedled to the wholesale disappearance  of the smaller  banks,  and  to their absorption by afew big and  powerful  establishments.   According  to  Hauser, the Deutsche Bankabsorbed forty-nine,  the Disconto-Gesellschaft  twenty-eight, and the Dresdner Bankforty-one.    This process of  financial concentration has been steadily  progressing eversince.   The  unit has  almost  disappeared, and there has sprung up in its place a sj^stemof groups strongly controlled, and, in spite of occasional rivalries, working on the wholein harmony with each other, and always in unison  with the  policy of the Government.The rive or six  controlling  houses represent an  organisation of  unlimited financialstrength.  These  aorain  have latterly become more and more  subject to the contiol ofdie Reichsbank, which institution now possesses almost  dictatorial powers over  theDanking world in Germany.    This  concentration of  financial  strength,  which in practice  amounts to unityof, control, obviously  possesses, advantages  with  which lesser organisations cannot hopeto compete.   It enables the banks to elaborate  programmes  on an  immense scale, andto rise  above the policy of mere dividends where national interests come into play.  Itvests in the  banks and the  Government an almost unlimited power of control over thewhole field of industrial enterprise, which has resulted, in a definite national commercialpolicy.   Next to concentration the other important  distinguishing  feature  of Germanbanking is the practice of widespread  participation in industrial and commercial under-takings.  German banks, act very largely as issue  houses.  No  enterprise  that showsthe slightest promise is unworthy of their attention.  All projects are carefully examined,and if accepted the banks become  large holders themselves, and are in. no  hurry tounload on the public until the  success of the undertaking is assured.  The amount ofpaper issued by the  banks annually before the war  was something  stupendous;  theDeutsche Bank and Disconto-Gesellschaft have.been known  to make between fifty andsixty issues in one year.   In the granting of credit to traders, and  manufacturers the
German banks have been lavish beyond  measure.   Such  a policy  obviously implies avery close association between the banks  and:the concerns and individuals to whom theylend their  financial assistance.  The  necessity on  the  part  of the banks to be  well-informed, and the constant and active interest which they are  forced to take in thewelfare of the undertakings which they have launched  and nursed, and  whose sharesthey have disposed of to their clients, has,  as  would-be inevitably  the case, led  to avery complete fusion of banking  and industrial interests.  The banks nominate  theirdirectors on the  boards of the undertakings in which they are interested, and these inturn are represented on the  hoards,, of the banks..  The  result of this system has beenthat once the bank establishes a hold over a company or individual independence ceases,and the bank enters virtually upon a dominant partnership.   Thus in Germany bankingand  industry  have  grown up  together  from  the  very  first closely  interlocked  andmutually  dependent upon each other;  whereas in the United Kingdom  no such closeassociation  has ever existed.  We cannot therefore speak  of German banking as havinga separate existence from general commercial policy.     I may here quote Kiesser-again.  He says :          &quot; To my mind it was  a  fortunate fact that  the German banks  from the very     start placed themselves at the particular service of trade and industry.  But at all     events it  will be granted that this was due to  the historically given German     conditions and requirements.  As a  result of this connection the banks have taken    a considerable part in the splendid industrial and commercial  developments of the     country,, which is characteristic of the last decades.&quot;                              IT.-272e Cartel System.    The  next most  important feature  of  the  German  internal  organisation  is thesyndication of industries.  The system of syndication is generally applied  to articles ofstandardised production,. i.e.., to articles; in  the manufacture of which there is a  certainequality in the cost of production, uniformity in quality and type of the finished  article,and  absence of likely  substitutes.   Typical  articles are coal, pig-iron,  rails,  girders,pines, glass, locomotives, &amp;c.   The German cartel syndicate differs  fiom the Americantrust in that the members  are not  absorbed  by the controlling interest, but  remainindependent and  separate entities.   They bind themselves, however, to sell  at  certainprices in home markets and abroad and to confine their business to certain geographicalareas.  At first the object in view was only to  regulate prices in the home market, butthe cartel  system has now developed into an  organisation never  dreamed of by itsoriginators, and as it stands to-day has become a most formidable instrument of Germanexport  trade.  It is responsible for the form of trading  known as &quot;dumping,&quot; a policyof price fixing  which consists in establishing two prices  for the same product a  com-paratively  high  price  on the home market behind the tariff wall, and  lower prices,varying according to  circumstances,  on  foreign  markets.   It  is  very  important tounderstand this intricate piece of mechanism as it affects the  export trade.     The  cartel does not in  any industry embrace the  entire  process of  production,but it stands at every stage of production.   Each cartel stands in the relationship  of abuyer to  the one immediately below it on the industrial  ladder, and of a seller to thatimmediately above it.   As each pursues its own  policy of selling  its  products  at thehighest possible price behind the tariff wall, it follows that, unless some corrective isapplied, the finishing industries would1 not be able to  carry on  an export trade at allWhen the  cartel  sysoem began to  develop an export  policy this difficulty manifesteditself, and all the force of German ingenuity was brought to bear to overcome it.     After  years  of wrangling  between  conflicting interests,  the  principle  becameeventually  accepted that the syndical home price for the raw  product must  be loweredwhen the latter is to be used in the manufacture  of an article destined for a foreignmarket,  and  a  system  of rebates  came  into existence, under  which each  cartel isallowed a drawback on the exported article equal to the difference between the internaland external price fixed by the cartel of the finishiag industries for the various countriesto which the  finished product is to be exporter).  Thus, for  instance,  the cartel oflocomotive makers will be &quot;allowed a certain drawback from the cartel of iron and  steelplates or boiler-makers on each locomotive exported, varying according to the price atwhich it  has to be sold in any particular country.  The iron and  steel plate or boiler-makers, again, are allowed a drawback from the pig-iron producers,  who again, in theirturn, are allowed a  drawback from the-  coal producers, and so on  right through thewhole gamut of producers who have  contributed to.the manufacture of the.  locomotive.
 Apply  this  principle  to all articles of  standardised  production  and we have  one of the secrets  of German  success in foreign markets.   Add  to  these  advantages a system of syndical bounties or bonuses from specially accumulated funds, and it is not difficult to understand why,  for instance, in Spain and France, Germany can tender for locomotives  30  centimes per  kilo,  lower than  the French  cost  price after  paying customs duties and freight.     The number of these cartels in Germany runs into many hundreds.     Once  the foreign market has  been  captured by  German manufactured articles (finished, not semi-manufactured  articles&apos;, and competition has been stifled, the prices for German goods can be adjusted (ie., raised) as required, and it is thus that the cartel system aims at an eventual  high profit as  recompense for a mediocre profit during the period of constructing the market.     The German cartel system  does not end at home ; it has of late years been extended to engross the industries of other countries  (notably Belgium J which enjoying certain advantages such  as cheap labour and national thrift were competitors of the German export trade.  After competing with the industries of these countries  for  some time, glowing prospects were  held out to the industries concerned of the advantages to  be derived from entering  into  the  German-controlled syndicates.   Thus it was that in Belgium many of the leading  industries, such as iron and steel, glass, &amp;c, were engrossed in so-called  international syndicates controlled by the guiding hand of Germany.   It was hoped by this and  other  methods  ultimately  to rope m these smaller countries-within the  German Zollverein, and eventually to absorb them  in a greater German Empire.  It is clear from this that the politics and commerce of Germanv were not and are not separate entities, but are  under one  great control namely, the State.                            III. Transport Facilities.     Another and equally important  factor of Germany&apos;s commercial policy  is  her transport organisation.   It has been said that the possession of railways by the State of Prussia &quot; places in the hands of the State  the most powerful instrument of its political economy&quot;   (Marlio).   &quot;La  loi  de  1905  sur  les  nouvelles  voies  navigables  de l&apos;Allemagne).&quot;  What  we must  clearly  realise is that  the State  does not run the railways as an industrial enterprise but as  a politico-commercial weapon to defend on the  one hand German industries from attack by foreign competition, and, secondly, to foster German exportation  by means  of an adjustment of rates and a system  of rebates. In the first instance it acts as a supertax to the tariff, and in the second as a bounty on German exports, and thus helps to break down foreign tariff walls.  By some skilfully manipulated international agreements the German railways are able to extend their domination well beyond the German frontiers.  The shipping companies come to the aid of the railways,  or  perhaps it would be more accurate to stare the case the other way  about,  for the German Government  have always denied that  they grant subsidies to the shipping companies.   Be that as it may, the two operate in close harmony, which  results in a system of combined sea-and-rail rates, so that by a single consignment note goods can be sent from German towns  in the interior to their destination abroad at an enormously reduced charge  and covering all costs.  There exists in Germany a very elaborate tarirF  of these reduced  rates  and  rebates, but without going  into detail suffice  it to say that the reductions amount in some instances to as much as  75 per cent.,  and in certain cases  these  rates are completed  by rebates which  practically amounts to free transport over  German territory.   This obviously has  the  effect of avery substantial State subsidy  to the shipping companies.   Add this advantage to theexporting prices fixed by the  carrels and we need  still less wonder why German goods compete so successfully with British either at home or in third markets.     Recent reports  which we  have received on British trade in Mesopotamia and thePersian Gulf show that during the ten years preceding  the war a very  substantialportion of our trade  was captured by  Germany  solely due to  superior transportfacilities.                                  IV. Shipp ing.     Germany&apos;s  shipping policy  plays a very important part as  an instrument ofexpansion beyond the sea.   Just as  she has realised the  need  for  industrial andfinancial concentration at home  in order to beat her competitors abroad so Germany haswith equal perspicacity seized on  the two vital principles concerning oversea transport,viz. : (1) that frequency  and not speed is the dominating factor; and (2) that it isnecessary to cater fur possible future markets and not only for a given clientele.
    Thus the German lines sail at fixed dates with short intervals and, as M. de Ribes,Christofle says, &quot; ihe creation  of shipping lines does not follow trade, it precedes it.&quot;The  multiplicity  of  lines and  the 1frequency -of- voyages  has the effect of loweringfreight charges.   One of the guiding  principles of  German  shipping  policy  is thecreation  of  trade  in the inverse  direction.  Great  use is made of foreign exportmovements not only to obtain raw material for German factories, but in order to justifyadditional steamer services and calls, thus opening up opportunities  and providing newfacilities  for trade in the opposite  direction.  German  zeal in  this respect has beenvery remarkable no less  than its  success.  This is a principle of great importance,^ towhich I propose to revert later.  Further, we must not forget that the German shippingcompany and  its agents  are a valuable  asset as creators of customers for  Germanindustry and advertisers of German goods.    Like the cartel system in manufacture, German shipping consists mainly  of hugesystems of control.  The various  companies may not always see eye to eye in policy,but they cling together  in order  to avoid excessive competition, and to prevent theforeign (British)  shipowner from stepping in.                         V. German Organisation Abroad.    Before the era of German economic expansion  abroad began a constant stream ofemigrants flowed  annually  in  ever-increasing volume  to foreign  countries.  Theseemigrants settled in  every part of  the globe, so that on the morrow of her sudden riseto industrial supremacy Germany found ready to hand colonies of German-speakingpeople ready to buy and  sell her wares, to propagate  the German language and methods,and to build up  those strongholds  of,:it-Deutschtum&quot; abroad  upon which basis  alonea permanent export trade can rest.  In  order to  prevent these masses of Germansscattered about in foreign parts from gradually drifting  farther and farther away froikthe Fatherland no efforts were spared  to maintain their national solidarity.  Patrioticleagues and societies were  formed in endless number. These institutions began tospring up wherever a German colony had settled ;  education, religion, science, literature,art in short,  every sphere of  intellectual activity was  represented.  It was earlyrecognised that the diffusion  of the German language was a most essential  element inthe intellectual and commercial  conquest of foreign countries.   Schools were thereforefounded.  In London there  were before the war no less than  eighty-five and  in theprovinces fifteen  such institutions; in Paris sixty.   In Antwerp  M. Claes, the editorof &quot; La Metropole Anversoise,&quot;  says there was a benefit society subventioned  by theGerman  Government, a society of mutual assistance,  called &quot; Hand-in-Hand&quot; ^,the&quot; Germania,&quot;  insuring suitable lodgings; a &quot; Yerein&quot;  for lodging ladies  and  girfs ;a home  for sailors; a  traders&apos; association  for  the promotion  of commerce  betweenAntwerp  and Rhenish  Prussia;  two  old soldiers&apos;  societies;  a  gymnastic  society; asociety  for  hand-workers; a ladies&apos; international club&quot;; six singing  societies, severalGerman schools, and even a society  for the maintenance  of German humour ! and manyothers.    Then there is  German propaganda work.  The German press outside  Europe beforethe war numbered 168  newspapers. These are  either  published in German or in thevernacular of the country, according to special, pur poses for which they exist.  To thesemust be added the  foreign  weekly editions  of the  principal German papers and thetechnical papers and reviews printed in many languages.  This propaganda has but oneobject, the spreading of German &quot; Kultur&quot; and the praise of all  things German.     A  very  valuable  aid  to German  propaganda has  been  the  preparation andcirculation in translation of  every kind of technical work.   This has  been so completethat in many countries  the only  technical books consulted  are those originally writtenby Germans in German.     So far had the organisation to influence the press of foreign countries gone before thewar that, according to  a Report  from Sir E. Goschen of February  1914, a  privatecompany was  to be formed in  which the  North-German Lloyd,  the  Hamburg-American Line, the Disconto-Gesellschaft, the Deutsche Bank,  the A E.G., Siemens,Krupp, and Gruton were to  participate, and which was to be subsidised by the ImperialForeign  Office, so as to give it a powerful and decisive influence.     Thus the State which, to  use Hauser&apos;s words, &quot;considers itself not only as thesovereign authority of the German  Empire, but as the directing organ of that amorphousmass, floating and all invading, which is called &apos; Peutschtum,&apos;&quot; is seen to deliberatelyfoster and strengthen these  essential pillars of German expansion abroad.[769]C
    Having gained a clear idea of the cardinal  features of the German  organisationboth at home and abroad, it becomes possible to  understand what  in reality  her  com-mercial policy a policy of peaceful  penetration abroad-means.  I do not pretend tohave dealt with the subject exhaustively.  A detailed  exposure of German methodswould fill many volumes, but for the present purpose  it  is sufficient ^ if we realise thatthe commercial policy of Germany represents :an organic  whole in which every part liasa definite purpose and a definite aim.  It is the product  of German &quot; Kultur.&quot;  It aimsat the  intellectual, moral, and material subjection of the  world.   It implies completesubordination  of the  individual  to the  interest of the Srate.  The  army, the navy,finance, industries, education, religion, literature, arts and science, commerce and trade,work with unity of purpose. and  concentrated  effort  towards  the realisation of thePan-German idea.   What we must clearly understand  in regard  to  Germany&apos;s com-mercial policy  is that the small trading unit  has almost disappeared, and that in itsplace there now sfand powerful  groups representing; national rather than individualinterests, with all the prestige and power of the German  Government in the backgroundto  support  them.   We must,  therefore, never forget that in  combating  Germanaspirations abroad we are dealing with a State and net with individuals.     Illuminating as it is to study the development of the vast structure of the Germaninternal machinery,  our real interest only begins when we come  to examine its effectonce it is set in motion with a view to the conquest of foreign markets.  Again we muststart with the  banks.  Finance is the pioneer of all commercial and industrial expansion.It paves the way for future trade, and holds ground once won against all comers.   Thefirst German movement abroad received its impetus from a desire to render Germanfinance independent of  London as a centre of exchange  for her oversea  trade.   TheDeutsche Bank was the first to establish a branch abroad, i.e., in  London in; 1869.   Theearlier history  of  the  development of German finance in foreign countries  is  achequered one.  The first  foreign branches  of  the Deutsche Bank  were not invariablysuccessful, and many had to close, but as the concentration of German financial strengthgrew internally so the movement abroad  continued, to spread, until before the war it  is]io exaggeration to say that the world was encompassed by a chain of German bankingestablishments either  direct offshoots  of  the  great   banking groups at home, orapparently independent houses  closely  linked  up  with  the controlling interests inGermany.  We have witnessed the  advent  of  these German  overseas banks in almostendless succession during the last two decades and seen them settle in every part of theglobe.  They are generally heralded with a flourish of trumpets  and welcomed withenthusiasm by the native population.  To them the German  bank augurs  good time.,long credits ou  easy terms, trade and industrial development, and general prosperity.Little do they suspect that  the German bank has come not to confer a blessing on thecountry,  but to sap,  little, by little,  its resources, financially, industrially, and commer-cially, until it becomes an economic vassal of Germany.  Behind it all are the deeply laidfar-seeing political aims of the German  Government, who though unseen unceasinglydirect, control, and contrive from Berlin.     In order to understand the modus operandi  of this  most insidious of instrumentsof peaceful penelration we cannot do better than examine the history of one of the mostnotorious and typical instances, the Banca Commerciale of Milan. Despite its Italian name,it was at its inception an  almost purelv  German undertaking, having been founded bythe Deutsche Bank, Disconto-Geselischaft, Dresdner Bank, Berliner ilandelsgesellschaft,and the  Schaafhau-en.   Backed  by the poweiful support of the German  Governmentand by themnmense facilities afforded by the German industrial  system as a whole forthe promotion of trade, it started  on its errand with  an enormous advantage.  It isinteresting to follow step by step  the  procedure  adopted.   Sometimes a  bank  isassigned a definite geographical area in which to operate, or it may be created for thepurpose of certain definite undertakings, such as the financing of railways or electricalenterprises.   In the case  of  the  Commerciale, Italy was the allotted  sphere.  At thestart the share capital was  5,200,0001   The Germans held a majority of the shares,and the control and the management was therefore also  German.   Gradually, however,owing to the  extraordinary discipline of,the shareholders, upon which the Germanscould  always  relv, German  capital began to leave the  Commerciale,  until  in  1914something.less  than. 18Q,000Z. represented the German  interest, but thanks to adroithandling  the  management and the  staff  still  remained  German, while all the foreigncapital invested in the concern was pressed into the service of German, interests.  Thecapital thus set free went to fertilise other promising fields &quot;of similar enterprhe.   It isthus, as Riesser says, &quot;solely by its banking  organisation that Germany has been able;to achieve an  immense task with practically no capital.&quot;  According to Signor Fr. Nitti,
 foreign  capital in Italy  in  1914 amounted approximately to 20,000,0007., of  which 7,280,0002. was represented hy Belgian, 5,920,0001. by French, 1,840,0002. by British, and 1,120/000Z. by German.   Yet withal German financial domination in Italy reigned supreme.  Once a German bank becomes established in a foreign country the current of capital begins to flow towards Germany.   This is the result of  a multitude of insidious practices and-devices.   It is for instance not difficult to divert  to the mother estabLsh- ments at home the greater part of -the profits of the daughter  bank abroad, while the latter is made use of as an instrument to unload on its clients German stocks  and shares not quoted in the local exchanges  and to diffuse German insurances.   In matters of credit the bank always conforms strictiy to the policy dictated by the banking group at home upon which  it depends.  If it is the foreign  State that  needs accommodation it acts  as  the  intermediary  and, thanks to  the close union at  home between  finance, industry (i.e., cartels), and the policy of the -Government, it is able.to exact terms in the shape of political services, contracts, and ;orders for goods from Germany.     Following in the track  of the  banks,  and aided  by their financial support, come the big industrial groups, and acquire a controlling interest much on the lines  above described in local undertakings,  mines, metallurgy, oil,  transport,  machinery, textile, chemical products, &amp;c.  Small  wonder that Italy had become   the economic vassal of Germany.   Once reduced to a state of bondage the  banks begin their rule of tyranny. The Gommerciale was particularly notorious in  this respect  Thanks to  an  elaborate system of intelligence it easily discovered when  a client  was favouring markets  other than  those of Germany.   Instantly he was threatened with .a withdrawal  of credit, and if refractory, the  Oommerciale would  at once by secret bulletins warn  the  other banks against the  particular  individual or.firm.  He would then be refused  all credit, and faced with the choice between ruin and capitulation.     This is peaceful penetration.   There is  no  need to multiply examples.  The Credit Anversois of Antwerp, the Orient-Bank, the Banco Aleman Transatlantico, the Deutsch- Asiatische  Bank,  and scores of  other banks,  whether masquerading under national names or not, are so many replicas of the Banca  Cornmerciale of Italy working on  the same lines and  with the same aims and same ideals German   hegemony beyond  the seas.   The same process is observable everywhere.     With such effective weapons as the.cartel, preferential transport rates adjustable to  circumstances,  and  export bounties, it  is  not difficult to see  how it becomes possible to break through almost any tariff wall.  But  what  happens when  foreign tariffs are at a prohibitive altitude ?  German subtlety is  still  equal to the  occasion. Industrial penetration at once takes the place of commercial penetration.  It is  often supposed that the evil of dumping disappears once  dumping across the frontier ceases, and it becomes necessary to set  up the factory behind  the tariff wall.  It is  even generally regarded as  wholly  sai is factory from the point of view of the invaded Stater for ostensibly it creates a new industry, and  therefore  brings capital, employment, and greater taxable capacity.  Ag-ain German ingenuity and discipline succeeds in  largely though not altogether falsifying these calculations.  Acting, on the same principles as in the case of German banks abroad, the minimum of German capital is exported that will insure the German interests a controlling-position.  Care is taken to see that most of the share capital and all the debenture capital is provided  by native or foreign populations. Indeed it is one of the guiding principles of German  penetration to place among the iiitiye clientele  debentures  which  confer no right of control over.the business,  and togive their whole attention to securing a slight majoriiy of well-disciplined German share- holders who can always.be  relied  on to attend meetings regularly for voting  purposes,and&apos;can appoint a German staff.and management.    Very frequently,  too, such factories  are  nothing more than workshops, wheredetached parts of machines imported on lower duties can be put  together.    r Its-is German organisation and discipline which triumphs once^rnore.    It is&apos;not possible within the limits of a departmental memorandum to do more thangive the bare outlines of this prodigious machine which Germany has  evolved for thepurpose of. achieving the  ends  of her politico-commercial policy.  We  have seen thatthe bedrock upon which that structure has been erected  is the close union of financeand industry at home.   It is interesting to note that in evidence before the AmericanNational  Monetary Commission, the directors of the Dresdner Bank said :          &quot; One difference between the banks of England and-Germany is that in    England the primary purpose of the banks seems to be to secure large earnings for    their shareholders.   In Germany our banks are largely responsible for the develop-
                                          B      merit of the Empire, having fostered and built up its industries.   It is from  1871      that our real development dates, and it  is since that year our great banks have      been organised.  To them more than to any  other  agency may be credited the      splendid results thus far realised.&quot;      Successful as this system has undoubtedly proved in the case of Germany, we must  never forget that it is the  outcome, not  of deliberate  forethought, but of necessity a  definite  set of conditions-and that with all its  indisputable advantages, it is  also  fraught  with obvious dangers.   It has many severe critics in Germany itself.   As  Riesser in his &quot; Grossbanken &quot; says :            &quot; The permanent  assumption of large risks in enterprises by credit banks is      incompatible  with fundamental principles of sound banking  policy, of which the      two  essential requirements are liquidity  of resources, distribution  of risks with      regard to persons, funds involved, and time and place.&quot;      Therefore, while it may be hardly open to  question that  in  times of peace and  prosperity there can be  no more effective weapon of peaceful penetration than  this  union between finance and industry which the German Government wields at will  in  the interests of imperial policy, it yet remains to be seen whether it is as well adapted  to survive the shock of a crisis like  the present war as our own  more conservative and  less enterprising financial policy.      Mr. Brand  has very rightly observed in one of his articles  in the &quot; Round Table &quot;  that  there  is some misconception as regards the financial assistance afforded  by the  banks to British trade and industry.  It is often alleged that the banks do not give the  assistance they ought to.   The truth is, there is no market where loanable  capital is  so freely at the  disposal of trade and industry as in this country.  Nevertheless, it is still  correct to say that our haphazard  policy of individualism has led to a loss of  contact  between the banks and industries.   As  a result, there exists fin this country nothing  approaching the fusion of the banking and industrial interests as there is  in Germany.  British banks do  not participate directly in  reorganisations,  flotations,  consolidations,  amalgamations,  schemes of any kind,  or permanent  partnerships in industrial under-  takings through stock ownership or representation on boards, or  both.      One great advantage of the German system is that, if a foreign Government  or  company contemplates embarking on some scheme of industrial  development involving  a large financial outlay, the temptation to go to Germany  in preference  to any other  country is almost irresistible.    Mr.  Brand points out  that  &quot; in  Germany their  scheme  will be considered  at once  by an institution  which combines the financial power, the  means of investigation and  research, the issuing capacity, and the industrial connections  amply sufficient  to carry  out any contract, however large, if the scheme is approved by  it.&quot;   In England such a scheme would not be taken up by any bank, because  it does  not possess the necessary organisation for handling it.  It would probably fall into the  hands of a-company promoter, who  might or might not succeed in launching it.*  It is  not surprising, therefore, that, in spite of our superior financial resqurces, Germany has  made more rapid progress than  we in her conquest of oversea markets.   This is  due to  two main causes :       1. The great German banks, as we have seen, are represented abroad by daughter            banks.  Foreign industrial interests are thus brought into direct  relation-            ship with the great groups of banks and industries in Germany ; and      2. German  banks abroad  start operations backed by  the  powerful support and            almost unlimited credit  of the German organisation at home.     The great English banks have no such daughter banks, while their  relations  with  British exchange  banks  abroad is  of  a  purely commercial character.   I may  here  quote a passage  from a report addressed to the  Board of Trade by Mr. T. A. Ainscough,  their  late Trade  Commissioner in China :           &quot; One of the most serious  handicaps to  British progress in the past has been     the entire lack of any means for financing deferred payments on important Chinese     Government and private contracts for public works, plant, machinery, and  supplies.     As the China Association clearly state :               &quot; &apos; In such cases as concessions for..rail ways, enterprises of this magnitude          can only be  financed  by the eventual issue of public loans, but  considerable    *  Exception may perhaps be  made in the case of railways aud harbour works,, which would be handled-  by well-known firms of contractors.
J         . &apos; outlay is often necessary before the stage is readied when a public issue can         .  be made; in other cases, such as contracts for ships, for machinery on a large          Scale, for electric lighting and power plants, &amp;c,  financial. facilities which          would enable the contractors to accept terms of deferred payment are often          necessary to secure business in competition with Germans.  In other directions          advances made  to viceroys and local  governors  by Germans  and Japanese          are  believed to have  resulted in large orders and concessions.   Both  the          German and Japanese Governments  have  given strong support  to their          nationals in transactions of this nature,  have made it their business to safeguard          these advances, and to see that they were not made in vain.&apos;          &quot; Our German competitors have usually been.able to arrange this finance through      the medium  of their  manufacturers in Europe-such houses as Messrs.  Krupp, the      A.E.G., and Siemens-Schuckert beino- enormous concerns, with the closest con-      nections  in  German finance  circles.   In  this  country,  however, their  is much      greater difficulty.  The majority  of our  manufacturers utilise  the whole  of their      &quot;resources in the organisation and running of their own works, and it is too much      to  expect them  to finance their  clients m addition,  nor is  such a method  an      economical one.   The British Exchange Banks do not care to lock up  their funds      for any period beyond the usance of the bills  drawn against actual shipments, and, as      the chief manager of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank remarks :   &apos; Such contracts      should  be financed by the local  banks of  the  country from which the goods are      supplied,  or  by the local  banks of the consuming  country.  In the case of China      the latter course  is hardly possible as yet,  as the  country has  not the necessary      banks.&apos;          &quot; The Joint-Stock Banks in  the United Kingdom have  not cared to invest      any portion of their vast  resources (which consist, in the main, of deposits at call      or  short  notice)  in such  long-date paper, when  they can rapidly turn over their      funds in the  London  market in discountiug the  fine paper of foreign  banks, and      in  arbitrage  transactions.  Hence has arisen the deadlock,  with the inevitable      results  that  British industrial interests have suffered, and that, the German firms      in China have secured an  undue share of the large industrial contracts which have      been offered.&quot;      The situation may therefore be summed up in Mr. Brand&apos;s  words :           &quot; If the world&apos;s trade  is to be fought for by foreign combinations and cartels      we, too, must build our industry on a  large  scale, and large industries  require      large methods of financing.&quot;      We must  fight with concentrated and not  with scattered forces.      I do not propose to enlarge on  the  merits or  demerits of the German system, or on its suitability  for adoption in  this  country.-   All  that  need  be  said is   that  a commercial policy is not  made it grows.   Though  policy&apos; may  in  the process of formation be influenced, guided,  and  shapad by  Government,  it must  of necessity, in the first instance,  spring from some form of co-operative effort at home.   Some, at least, of the many  problems that arise in  connection with ,the  reorganisation  of our internal affairs are, I take  it, now under the consideration of Lord  Balfour  of Burleigh&apos;s Com- mittee.   I have no doubt that  the  whole field of our industrial and commercial and financial life will be carefully surveyed with  a view to the enhancement of our national efficiency.   Fiscal policy, Inter-Imperial  policy,  transport facilities,  company law, shipping, taxation, industrial combination, labour, finance, education, scientific research, &amp;c, all these domestic problems must first be solved before it becomes possible to speak of any national commercial policy in the true sensa      The creation of the  Trade Corporation,  implies  a recognition of the German principle that finance and industry  should go forward hand in hand.   It marks a great departure from our traditional attitude  towards, this subject.   If the Trade Corporation succeeds  in its mission  and. establishes real daughter banks  abroad, thus linking up foreign interests with our industrial system,  the Foreign Office will inevitably be drawn into much closer relations with the financial and industrial interests of this country, and we may gradually  see emerge from this co-operation something resembling a commercial policy which eventually may  assume  such proportions as to dominate our foreign relations.  If the bank were divided like the Deutsche Bank into geographical sections, and these were made to correspond with the political departments of the Foreign Office, it might be possible to arrange for the heads of the corresponding departments to be in close  touch with each  other and thus establish the link between policy and  finance, a       [769]                                                       &apos;      D
matter of such vital importance for the future.  The success of the bank will, however;depend  largely on the sympathy  and support which the Corporation will receive  fromthe other banks.  Though it is  always  dangerous to prophesy, I confess I have  somemisgiving on that point.  It  is true that  the capital of the Trade Bank is the same asthat of the Deutsche Bank, viz.,  10,000,0001, but the latter owes its real strength tothe practically unlimited resources at its disposal through its alliances and affiliations withother banks.   The strong criticism and opposition with which the new Trade Bank hasmet in the financial world does not augur well for the future, and unless the support ofthe other banks is forthcoming it  is difficult to see how without a Government guaranteeit will be in a position to finance  undertakings on the scale which is anticipated  afterthe war.    Still we  must accept the Trade Bank as  a  step in the  direction  of greaterco-ordination and combination.  It is also satisfactory to note tlbat in the manufacturingworld there is a similar movement on foot towards greater co-operative effort.   Here Icome  to the main purpose of this memorandum.   Should  not the corollary  of thismovement be a like effort at greater  unity and solidarity among British  communitiesabroad ?  It is here that I think there  is room for a  little constructive work by theForeign Office.   It is, of course, neither desirable nor necessary  to organise them intoan elaborate system of espionage  as our  enemies did,  nor in any way to embark on apolicy of peaceful penetration in  the  German sense, but I  cannot help thinking thatmuch can be done to get the communities to &quot;pull together&quot; more, and to constitutethem  into a stronger and more useful bulwark of Empire.    We have seen with what assiduous care  the German Government&apos; fosters thecreation of local  clubs, patriotic societies  (&quot;Yereine&quot;), and institutions  abroad as theoutposts of &quot; Deutschtum,&quot; such as the foundation of schools, of  local German papers,more or less under the eegis of the German missions and consulates, all  of which tendsto  bind  the local  communities together  and to make  them co-operate with the  samesingleness of purpose as their compatriots at home.  Surely here is something  fromwhich we might  with advantage learn a lesson, without of- course going the lengththe Germans went.    1 therefore venture to put forward the following suggestions for consideration: -    1.  That all missions and  consulates  should receive fuller  instructions as to the           aims  and  objects  which  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government have  in  mind  as           regards the expansion of British trade and influence abroad.    2.  That a compulsory system of registration be introduced for all British  subjects           abroad.  This would  have the effect of bringing them automatically into           touch with the consulates every year.    3.  The foundation of British schools abroad.  This should be considered from two           points  of  view :  (a) The need for the provision of educational facilities for           the children  of the  British   community;  (6) the  possibility of  bringing           native children under  British influence and  creating in them a prejudice in           favour of British ideals.   (The  replies from missions which  have  been           received in answer to  a circular on this subject nearly all agree in the value           of these institutions as means of commercial and political propaganda.)    4.  The formation of a Patriotic  League.  There has  never been a time in our           history when an appeal to the patriotism of British  subjects  was likely to           produce better  results.  It might  perhaps take the form of a circular letter           asking the recipient to volunteer certain duties and to si ate what he would           be willing to  do, such  as, for instance, to assist in obtaining information for           Form (K).    5. The formation of Chambers of Commerce.   My personal view  is that His           Majesty&apos;s Government should contribute to their maintenance, so  as to be           able  to exercise some  control, without, however, interfering with their spirit           of initiative.    6.  To encouiage  any  other  institution tending to produce  a spirit of solidarity           between Biitish subjects abroad.    7.  To encourage the creation  of a local newspaper, which could  be  supplied  with           useful  material from  home, and not be allowed to degenerate into an organ           to ventilate petty local disagreements.    8. The dissemination of commercial and political propaganda.    9.  Moderate sums to be allowed to consular officers for the purpose of celebrating           the King&apos;s birthdays  and  other patriotic festivals, such  as Empire Day.           Reports to  be furnished   annually.   Special allowances to be granted to           consular officers when  they become &quot; doyens.&quot;
M      The disintegrating tendencies  of  British communities abroad  is  the subject  of -frequent complaints on the part of consular officers.   The  German intelligence service depends very largely for its efficiency on  the way in which the German consuls and the German colonies co-operate.  It is a system of give  and take.   Hence  their ability to dispense with Chambers of Commerce abroad.   Our consuls  often complain that they are not sufficiently consulted,  and that British subjects only seek their assistance when they have  got into trouble.    Everything should  be done  to encourage the public to make better use of the consular service, and equally everything should be done to induce consular officers  to  exercise tact  and discrimination qualities  which they do  not, unfortunately, always display.      The Belgian Trade Committee, which has  now  commenced its sittings and  is studying the economic, industrial, financial, and  social conditions of Belgium with a view  to supplanting German domination and influence by British, will, I  have  little doubt, in the course of their deliberations, run up against the German methods above described at every turn.   There could be no better example of the effects of peaceful penetration than Belgium,   it is to be hoped, therefore, that the committee&apos;s report will inter alia contain recommendations  which may form the basis of a policy for other parts  of the world.  Therefore, before considering  the wider problem, I suggest, if this policy be approved,in principle, that we should  await the report of that committee, but in  the  meantime invite suggestions from our  missions and  consulates-genera). Eventually,a committee might he formed, to consider the whole matter.     The German methods, as analysed -in  this memorandum, show  that there is no magic in their system.   It  is largely an artificial  growth peculiarly   suited to the German genius for organisation, thoroughness, discipline, thrift, docility, and aptitude for double-dealing and  political intrigue.   Still  we are forced  to recognise  that  in. the circumstances  it  was  for  Germany the  right policy.   The  chief failure of the German system has  been  its  combination  with the  typical arrogance  of  the German  individual,  which has  rendered him unbearable  once  he has  succeeded in obtaining the mastery in trade and  industry of a  foreign country.  The individual &quot;Kultur&quot; of the German (his lack of understanding of other peopie&apos;s psychology) has been the main stumbling-block to complete success.   Stripped  of&quot; its intellectual  and moral distortions there is much that we can learn from it.   Tt is true that when the cartels sell  at the  highest  price behind the tariff  wall  it is the German consumer that,pays the piper, that  when the German  Government  resorts to all kinds of fiscal jugglery in  support of particular  interests, or consents  to carry German goods over the railways  for next to nothing, it is the  German  taxpayer  that  pays  the piper;  but notwithstanding that, and regarding the  German  nation in the light of a singJe entity, I confess it seems to me an open  question  whether what they have lost with the  one hand has not been more than  amply repaid by what  has  been  gathered in with  the other.  What has been a triumph in the case of Germ my  would not necessarily prove a  suecess if applied to this  country,  and  we must  therefore  walk  warily  before following in Germany 1s footsteps, especially, as regards her more questionable methods. As regards her foreign trade, apart from the basic principle of co-ordination, combination, and co-operation  at  hqm3, we certainly can learn  two others which seem to me should be the sheet anchor of any  foreign commercial policy, and these are of peculiar interest to this Department.     These are: that in,order to maintain a permanent export  trade it  is absolutely indispensable, (1) to get a .firm  footing in  the economic life of foreign  countries by creating  vested interests and by other subsidiary aids; and.  (2) to  regard as a matter Cf equal importance the creation of trade in the inverse direction.     In support of this latter principle, I  cannot  do  better than quote a passage from a recent  memorandum by Mr.&apos; Bray to  the  Board  of Trade on  British trade with Latin America :                &apos;         &quot; In the course of this memorandum I have emphasised repeatedly the danger     of considering the LatinAmerican republics  as  buyers only, and  that a great     foreign trade cannot be built up or held on  this lopsided  arrangement.  In the   - plans for extending  our national trade it  must  always be  remembered that the   /- only assurance that we have for our hold on the markets of Latin America is to be   &quot; found in the  fact that we are theirs ; in other words, our buying must go hand in     hand with our selling.   The trade of Latin  America is, indeed, a great prize, but it   -  must be sought diligently and earnestly, and we must not for a moment lose sight     of the  reciprocal  aspect.  If  we  ate  to  maintain the leading position  in  the     competition for their custom  we must -open our  doors wider than at present to       [769]                               f                                  &quot;
     admit  the  raw  material  they have  in  such lavish&quot;&apos; abundance.  Exports  and     imports-these two things are indissolubly linked together, as the Unite. I States is     proving  to-day  in  its great  stump  campaign, to capture these  markets while     Europe  is  *o  embarrassed.   Increased  outflow  means additional  purchasing     power, and the two must always be considered in this  relation.  The  commercial     representative should keep this matter very prominently in his thoughts.&quot;     I would endorse every word of this.     No discussion of our future foreign commercial relations would be complete without a brief reference to the cognate subject, viz., inter-Imperial trade policy.  I do not know precisely what the position is as regards this question, and I therefore  speak with the greatest diffidence and subject to correction.   It is generally understood, however, that we are in some measure committed to the principle  of colonial preference.   Until  this policy is worked out in detail it  must remain an unknown and imponderable quantity. This much can be said with certainty : that if it implies the erection of a tariff in the United Kingdom differentiating in favour of the colonies and to the detriment of the Allies, there will be much irritation on the part of the latter, which may endanger the maintenance of good political relations.   Secondly, the  policy of colonial preference  is b sed on the idea of the self-sufficiency of .the Empire.  It  is no doubt a sound  policy to  strengthen  and develop the Empire, but we must not overlook the fact that it may lead to a. diversion of a certain amount,  of our foreign trade to the  colonies.  On the whole, I should have thought that, economically speaking, foreign trade offered greater prizes than  colonial trade; and as a diminution of our foreign trade implies a diminution of our political influence all the  world over, and  consequently some  clanger to  the position of London as the clearing-house of international trade,  I cannot help thinking that it is a  matter for consideration whether an effort should not be made to  preserve a certain balance between the two.     While admitting that there is much in the German system worthy of careful study, we  must never lose sight of the fact that it is an  artificial product, the outcome  of an unfortunate set of circumstances, not of healthy and normal  development.   The  closer union of finance witl industry, though unequalled as a weapon of peaceful penetration, constitutes on the one hand a danger to finance, while on the other it leads to a riotous acceleration of production.  Over capitalisation,- over production, and  an ever-increasing pressure to secure foreign markets was the inevitable result.   Between  60 and 70  per cent, of Germany&apos;&apos;s production was destined for exportation.  When we come to realise this fact, together with the growing anxiety at the gradual  exhaustion  of her internal sources 6f raw material,  especially  iron,  it  is easy to understand that commercial expansion beyond the seas, control  over  foreign markets and the sources  of raw material abroad was becomi ng a matter of ever-increasing urgency and imperious necessity.     Who shall  say in what proportion the  present war  is due to the  military  or economic side of this  over-heated machine ?   One  thing is certain, and that is  the great  industrial, though not  perhaps  financial,   interests  in  Germany  welcomed &quot;der Tag&quot;  every bit as much  as  the  army  and  navy.  We  have evidence to show that in  the earlier days  of the  war  some  of the big iron  and  steel works were greatly enlarging their plant in order to cope with  after-war requirements.    The loss of Lorraine and the removal of Luxembourg from the &quot; Zollverein &quot; would be a heavier blow to  Germany  than an\ thing  the  Paris  Resolutions are  likely to effect,  for it would deprive her permanently of 80 per cent, of the raw  material  for her iron and steel industries.   Germany&apos;s real strength consists in her domestic organisation.  Let us therefore  hope that the  effects  of this war will be such as to largely  wreck  theinternal machinery of Germany, at any rate for a time, so that we may be able  to takeadvantage of the respite to put our house in order.   The want  of liquidity of German banking  methods, which  even  before  the  war had steadily become more and  more accentuated, the  general state  of financial  and industrial  exhaustion, the  dearth  of labour,  the  future  burdens  of  taxation, the  decline in the value of  the mark and consequent high cost of raw material, are all  hopeful signs.  But whatever may  befall the German  nation as the result  of defeat   in the field, they  have gained practical experience of the efficacy of their system, and  we  must, therefore, expect to  see  them set  to work to build it up  again with renewed and  intensified energy.   Germany is, however, not the  only country we shall have to reckon with in the  future.   There is Japan and the United States.    I should like to add a word; with regard to our diplomatic, commercial attache, and consular  services.  For years  past  these services  have  come  in for a great  deal of criticism.  The fact is this,  The mercantile community of this country has found itself
 gradually driven by Germany  from  many fields in  which- formerly its supremacy remained  unchallenged.  Without  analysing the true causes the public have become profoundly dissatisfied with the  general situation,  and yet with few exceptions they cannot trace the root of the evil.  They are of course painfully conscious of the gigantic strides made by Germany in the last forty years in capturing from  us many valuable markets in foreign countries, and they infer from this fact that it is due to the superior assistance given by  the German diplomatic and consular services to German trade.   In a minor degree there may be some truth in this assertion, but  only in the sense that these services have  from long  experience in  wielding the very formidable weapon which the internal organisation of Germany places in their hands become more efficient instruments of German policy.  A boy with  a rifle  in his hand is &quot;obviously a more formidable opponent than a. man with  a  bludgeon.  And so  it  is with the German diplomatic and consular services.   Taken as a whole I do not think there is any inherent superiority in the German services over our own as regards general efficiency, and it is satisfactory to note  that  the German  press is almost as loud in their condemnation as the British press is in regard to ours.   While I do  not say that  there  is  not  room for very great improvement in  our services it  is quite clear that public criticism rests on a totally wrong diagnosis of the case.   No  Government assistance can make up for the want of individual effort or lack of industrial organisation.  Therefore, no matter how highly trained and well equipped these services  may become in  the future, so long as^ they are not backed  by a strong  organisation at home they never can and never will come up to public expectations.   As it is  obviously impossible  to set up our internal machinery, or accomplish the training of the new material for our services over night,we can scarcely expect to see any abatement of public criticism in the near future.
