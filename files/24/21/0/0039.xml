Draft yrej)ared,.rajiarinatruetlon^,of Jar Cabinet Minute .195 (11)     DRAFT TELEGRAM ^ TO i&apos;05D JTpJRT^CLIF^ or SIR C^SPRING RICE,Personal      Following is  a memorandum on submarine situation.   It oon-tains much secret information which must on no account be allowedto leak out.    For  your personal information in order to showdifficulties  of anti-submarine war. I may say that the recordof the American flotilla  in European waters to date on preciselysimilar basis of classification is 2 possibles and 3 improbables.We should  like an authoritative estimate of American new con-atruction  at  the earliest possible date.      The  true index to the success or failure of the submarinecampaign in future will be the balance between merchant ships sunkand merchant ships put into commission.  For the measures we havetaken for  shortening voyages,  bettor loading, quicker turning round,confiscation of interned German shipping, diversion of Allied andNeutral ships from coastal or  non-war traffic,  and other methodsof making  improved use of existing resources, vshich have so farenabled us  to keep up tonnage  entrances despite losses,  will soonhave had their full effect.   The effect of the submarine inrestricting the supplies of the Allies will then be accuratelyshown by the relative figures  of loss and gain.   The positionfrom February let.  is as fellows:-ftrose tonnage lost by enemy action.MEMORANDUM  OH  SUBMARINE  CAMPAIGN.1917BritishAllied &amp; NeutralTotalFebruary      313,000         219,000Kerch         342,000         B46.000April         641,000         384,000May           352,000         248,000June         v395,000        -258,000July         v301.OOQ        ^258.000Total  2,244j000       1,547,000532,000588;000865,000594,000653,000&apos;559,0003,791,000i  On basis of first three weeks of Julyx   &quot;   n   &quot;  losses February to Jane.
     In-addition there--are a jiumber. or vesselsdamaged by torpedo or mine.   For the first six tenths  of  1917  the figures were as follows.          1917      Eritish      Ajl?j.ed  JTeu^Sl       Total 1st 3 months      124:000 ..

Thus on the basis of the first six months actual  experience cf unrestricted submarine warfare, and tairing into account only the vessels actually sunk, the loss of gross tonnage is:-                  3?.or month              Per ernum     British       570,000              4,500,000     A13.1e  &amp;      260,000              3.100,000     Neutral      ^ ^ *__                  ^ &apos;        Total      650,000              7,600,000 .     When we come to consider whether this rate of loss is likely to rise or fall in future the factors are  so  numerous.and so incalculable that any estimate must be more or less of a guess.  The principal methods of the enemy at present are to maintain 15 to 20 large submarines in the areas where traffic converges on British and French ports, exclusive  of  the Medi- terranean, and to sow mines continuously from submarines in shallow waters through which vessels have to pass.   Obviously the best way of dealing with the submarine is to  attack it in its Dases, or to prevent its ingress into the Uorth  Sea,  or its egress from the ITorth Sea into the Atlantic.  It  has  never been found practicable, however, to prevent the German submarine from
using the many points of entry into tho North Sea, nor, asexperience in the Channel and the Dardanelles has shown, hasit been possible to close the exits therefrom, though thepassage is being made steadily more dangerous by mines andin other ways,  The main method of tho anti-submarine campaign,therefore, aims at picking up the enemy submarine at theearliest possible moment, patrolling with every variety of craft,destroyers, trawlers, drifters, sloops, seaplanos and balloonsthe areas in which they operate and through whioh they pass,and attacking them by gunfire, depth charges, mortars, bombs,and so forth, directly they are sighted.  There are now nearly3*000 vessels whose cole duty&apos;it is to patrol the coastalroutes and areas of concentration on tho High Seas* mine-sweeping, escorting and-otherwise engaged in anti-submarinework, and these numbers are continually increasing.  The sub-marine war, however,  is a contest in which both sides are con-tinually improving their weapons and their methods.  Results,therefore, are bound to fluctuate and relative success andfailure depend upon the continuous energy and resource , notmerely upon the sea,  but in building and invention on land.     But certain broad facts begin to stand out.   On the oneband, the enemy submarine will not be deprived of the power ofsuccessful offensive  unless the submarine bases themselves aredestroyed, or a detector is invented whioh will enable a movingsurface vessel to locate with accuracy and at a considerabledistance the presence of a submerged submarine.  No number ofpatrol and anti-submarine vessels,  however great,  and howeverskilfully handled, will be able to prevent large  submarines,operating from far afield and determinedly used,  from tor-pedoing merchantmen.   Our operations have already forced them
 to rely almost -entirely en^ubmexgisd^^                  but how effective this wholly hidden attack can he is seen from the fact that daring April, May and June 75$ of the merchant- men sunk did not  see either the submarine or the periscope before or after being struck.  Further, there is no doubt that the Germans are building submarines far faster than we destroy them.  The best opinion estimates that they complete 3 submarines a week.  It is quite impossible to frame any accurate estimate of enemy losses.   The certainties are but a small fraction of the probables and the probables of the possibles.   There is, too, no means of estimating their losses from other causes than direct attack.  In thirteen weeks recently the classification of the results of encounters gives -6.certainties and 13 probables.     On the other hand, it is extremely likely that the morale of the German submarine service is declining under the continuous and increasing strain of the anti-submarine attack. The methods and instruments for attacking submarines are also steadily increasing, and we have great hopes from the develop- ment of mines of various kinds, aircraft, torpedoes, counter attack by submarine, depth charges,  bomb mortars,  and other devices, though no fully effective hydrophone or magnetic de- tector has yet been discovered.  The fact that they have now to rely almost entirely on submerged attack, by depriving them of their gun armament, has diminished their efficiency and shortened the period for which they can remain at  sea.   The oxtension of the convoy system as more patrol and escort vessels  become availablewill also, it is hoped, make successful attack more  difficult. The longer nights and the shorter days of the Winter season ought
also to have the same effect.    Geod results have also followedfrom the special courses for training merchant captains in how toevade, submriries ^and ^aaridle their ships in the event of anattack.   As many captains and mates as possible^are beingput through these courses.   It is indisputable that speed is  &apos;                     Va great factor of safety,  and that vessels of s speed of 14  -knots and over suffer far fewer losses in proportion thanships of slower speed.      To sum up, it is obviously impossible to form anythingapproaching a trustworthy forecast of the future, but so faras an estimate is of value as a general guide it is estimatedthat the submarine losses will not increase above the averageof the last six months,  though they will fluctuate, and that ifthose on land do their utmost in invention and manufacture tosupport the men at sea,  they ought to diminish.      This, however, leaves us face to face with a very seriousposition.   The only possible basis upon which we can make ourplans for the future is  that the average rate of losses willcontinue, and this means that they will amount to an average   630,000 tons per month, i.e. 370,000 British and 260,000Allied and Neutral.   How serious this is can be seen by turningto the^probable figures  of newvconstruction.   During the firstsix months of 1917 only 485,000 tons of new shipping was launchedapart from naval requirements,  as against 2,2^0,000 tons sunk ofBritish, shipping alone.    For the seeond half of the year thehighest estimate of new  construction is 1,090,000 as against aloss to British shipping alone on the basis of average lossessince February of twice  as much,    For  V next year the programmeto which we are working  provides  for the&apos; construction of about250,000 tons of commercial shipping per month or some 3,000,000
                         -  6 itons for the year,  a ^figure-rfdX&amp;*J*^our naval programme- to  the  absolute minimum,  and which willonly be realised in the fourth year of the wari  if very greatdifficulties which  stand in the way are successfully overcome.It is uncertaih what further  increment will be available fromother countries,  but how little is likely to be forthcomingcompared with the loss  can  be  sfeen from their output for thewhole of 1913.                                        GrpBs Reg. Tons.British Colonies ......     26,000Canadian Lake Ports      ..     21,000Denmark......  ..         40,000Prance   ....      ..        176.DDDHolland......  *.  ..    104,000Italy..  ..      ..  i.  ..     50,000Japan..  ..          ..  ..     64,000Norway   ..  ..  &apos;..  ..  ..     50,000Swaden   ..  ..  ..  ..  ..     18,000      Thus the broad fact  stares uS in the face that even if ournew construction reaches its estimated maximum we can only seeour way to an output of 250,000 tons of mercantile shippingper month, to which some 50.000 tons can probably be addedfrom countries other than the U.S.A.,  as against a loss on thebasis already described of 630,000 tons per month to British,Allied and Neutral shipping from the German submarine.      The submarine campaign ie certainly not likely to forceGreat Britain to stop the war.   Por despite all losses, wehave succeeded in strengthening our weakest point by buildingup a stock of wheat, which, with the forthcoming harvest, willequal a six months supply of bread.   But unless we can equalise &apos;losses and gains it will inevitably diminish the effective pressurethe Allies can bring to bear upon the Central powers.   TheBritish rate of import before the war was 4,900,000 tons permonth, for 1916 it was 3,70C?000 tons per month, for the firstfive months cf 1917 it was only 2,900,000 tons per month.  This
j^M^Um is due far more-to the u^^erch^xi vessels on pur^^mi^^t/^submarine campaign. But it means that our imports,  which have been ruthlessly  cut down and are now practically entirely on war account, are  very near their bedrock figure .  Despite all efforts to increase the production of food stuffs and raw material at home, further. considerable reductions in the amount of shipping availablemust force us to reduce the supplies of coal and other neces* sitiea to our Allies,  or of munitions to the fronts, or to abandon military operations which are vital to the general strategic scheme for breaking up the dominion of the Germanicmilitary power over Central luxope and its Balkan and TurkishAllies.     The part,  therefore,  which the United States can play indealing with the submarine menace is absolutely vital to thesuccessful prosecution of  the War,  and to the attainment ofan early peace.   The most  important sphere in which she canconcentrate her activities,  is  that of increasing the efficiencyof the anti-submarine  war,  for protection of the mercantilemarine is a far more effective  measure than replacement&apos;.  Apartfrom invention  the  first need ia that every suitable yard shouldbe devoted to the construction  of vessels capable of taking partin the campaign. Every available suitable craft in alliedwaters in Europe is already employed on this work and all Britishyards capable of doing this construction are already engagedupon it.  But it is impossible  to have enough,  and with theincrease in the  siae and numbers of the German submarines,  thearea to be patrolled will  inevitably extend.     Only second in importance  comes commercial shipbuilding.The deficit to  be made up  is more than 300,000 tons a month.Can America supply  this amount  and if so by what dates?   Onthe answer to this  question the prospects of  the Allies  largelydepend .  The War Cabinet  would like a detailed answer  on thispoint ae eoon as possible,28th July,  1917.
