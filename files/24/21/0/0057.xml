The returns made by the Agricultural Commissioners  of theNational Service Department show that the numbers  of  men placed
                        -2-from this class of labour are--           Promised   ....   13,275           Arrived    ....   15,138           Sent out   ....    9,85C     There is a marked increase in the number of complaintsreceived from farmers of the unsuitability of many of the mensent by the Military Authorities for work on the land includingnumerous cases of alleged physical incapacity on the part of themen.   It seems clear that recent drafts for this work have corn-prised men of considerably lower categories than those hithertosent.     It is regretted that serious friction has arisen betweenthis Department and tho Pood Production Department of the Boardof Agriculture owing to a breach by the latter of an agreementconcerning the allocation of military labour entered into lastMay by the President of the Board and the Direotor-General ofNational Service.     2*   Scotland.   The work of distribution of labour on theland continues satisfactorily.(b)  National Service Volunteers for Agriculture.     The number of Volunteers passed for Agriculture (to date)after interview is 2,975; the number of Volunteers asked for is1,741, and of these 737 have been placed.(c)  Part-Time Labour.     (1)  Corn Harvest.    The position is unaltered since thereport of last week when the reluctance of the farmers to acceptunskilled, civilian assistance was mentioned.    After discussionwith the Food Production Department of the Board of Agriculture,however, arrangements are being made to obtain unskilled assist-ants for a period of not less than three weeks at a time, with aview to  meeting the needs of farmers in Counties where the demandshave not been specifically limited to skilled workers.     (2)  Timber Workers.  The advance party of the men who en-rolled for Part-Time Service on this work through tho VolunteersMunitions Brigade, for whom the Director of Agriculture had
obtained work at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, have commenced work.     The National Service Commissioner for Scotland reportsthat he continues to send out a number of school boys forforestry and is of opinion that the number so placed in Scot-land will exceed 1,000,     (3)  Miners for Agricultural Work.   It has been decidednot to proceed with the proposed scheme of the employment ofminers on the land as it is apparent that only limited successcould be obtained on account of the high rate of wage whichwould have to be paid to the men.     (4)  School Boy and Professional Labour on the Land.This scheme is proceeding very satisfactorily, and there isnothing special to report since last week.GENERAL TRADES SECTION.( )  Trade Committees.     So far as information is available, some 900 substitutionVolunteers have already been enrolled in the English BuildingTrades, of whom about 190 have been asked for by SubstitutionOfficers, and 24 placed.   During the week, a mass meeting washeld at Leicester in connection with this Scheme, which wasstated to be very successfull.   Fifteen Local Committees havebeen formed in the Furnishing Trades and 170 Volunteers obtain-edr while in connection with the Entertainments Industries, about670 Volunteers have been obtained,  of whom 41 have been asked forand placed by Substitution Officers.   With regard to other TradeCommittee Schemes, no further information is available this week,uncertainty about the future having made it necessary to marktime for the present.(b)  Other Schemes.     Arrangements have beon made for the transfer of 50 coalminers to one company, in batches of 5 per week,  beginningnext week.LOCAL NATIONAL SERVICE COIvhlTTSES1  SHE TION.(a)  Local Committees.   The number of National Service Committees
*-4-286appointed to date is  as  under:-To DateLast Week.In England &amp; WalesIn Scotland871149870149Although the increase in the number of Committees is only oneduring the course of the past week, there are still some fewimportant places where Committees should be established, butin view of the present circumstances pressure to form Commit-tees has not been exerted.    If, however, operations becamemore active further Committees would undoubtedly be constituted.(b)  Corn Harvest.    During the past week applications havebeen received from the Pood Production Department for 975workers in the Counties of Hertford, Lincoln, (Kesteven),Northumberland, Warwick, Worcester, Brecon and Denbigh.  Inconsequence thereof circular letters and all necessary accom-panying forms have been despatched to the National ServiceCommittees in those Counties, making a total of 92 Committees.In very many instances letters have been received from theCommittees stating that they have been informed by the Agricul-tural Commissioners or Sub-Commissioners of this Departmentthat there is no demand by the farmers for such workers, inspite of the applications made by the Pood Production Depart-ment, and considerable difficulty has arisen in dealing withsudi cases.   In some instances the Committees after havingbeen requested to obtain these workers have had to be requestednot to do anything further owing to the position reported to bein existence within their area.     Reports from the County of Lancashire show that in spite-of the Pood Production Department^ application for workersthere is no demand for them, and similar reports have beenreceived in respect of the  Isle of Ely, Durham,  and Cambridge,and also from the Hetropclitan Committees.(c)  Part-Time Labour and Co-operation in Business.    Part-TimeLabour Schemes are now in operation in Boroughs  and Urban
Districts to the number of 68, and Co-operation in BusinessSchemes to the number of 45.SUBSTITUTION SECTION.(a)  Check on Progress of Work.   The chief feature of the re-ports received from the Country this week is the general commentmade by all the Commissioners as to the harm that is being doneto the National Service Scheme through the notices which are ap-pearing in the Press regarding the future of the Department, andthe absence of any official intimation as to what their futureis to be.   A few quotations on this point may be given from theCommissioners1  reports     Mr, Rowland, Wales.  &quot;Repeated references in the Press as well     as questions in Parliament regarding the Department continue     to produce very disconcerting and damaging effects.&quot;     Mr. Wilson, Scotland.  &quot;Thore is at the moment, owing to     various vague Press notices, a certain feeling of uneasiness     as to tho scheme generally.  This is very natural, but it is     not helping the practical and useful work of substitution     and the supply of Volunteers from Trades and other Committees.&quot;     Mr. Johnson, Acting Commissioner for Bristol.  &quot;Reports in     the Press are having a most disturbing and demoralising     effect, and it is exceedingly hard to overcome the impression     produced by them on everyone ?*ith whom one comes in contact.     It is urgent that steps should be taken to counteract this     bad effect.&apos;&apos;     Mr. Jackson, Manchester.   &quot;Attention has been called to the     paragraphs which have recently appeared in the local Press     stating that the Department is shortly to be closed down,     and it is thought that a definite pronouncement on this     matter should be made in ordor to clear away doubts which     these statements have caused.&quot;(b)  Volunteers placed during week.     The number demands for National Service and SubstitutionVolunteers reaching the S.Os during the week amounted to 1,545, -1,900 Volunteers have been submitted and 691 have been placed.(c)  Local Trade Committees,     The work of these Committees has been hampered, first ofall by the absence of work for them to do, and secondly by thedoubt which still exists owing to the attitude of the Treasuryas to who is to pay the difference in the rate of wages when aSubstitution Volunteer is transferred from one occupation toanother, and the latter carries a lower rate than the former.
                      -6-The A.S.O. for Derby and Nottingham area reports that theBuilding Trades Federation, Nottinghamshire, states     1.  They are tired of having little or nothing to do,     2.  They absolutely refuse to do any work through the         Labour Exchanges.     5.  They are prepared to get along with Substitution work         if this can be provided at once, otherwise the Committee         will be dissolved.Mr. Wright adds:- &quot;This Federation includes the following trades:         Bricklayers, Joiners, Plasterers, Stone Masons, Elec-         tricians, Tilers &amp; Slaters.   I have visited Nottingham         with reference to this matter and have had interviews         with the S.A.S.C. and the Sub-Commissioner.   The latter         officer, who is a very tactful man, is trying to smooth         matters out.&quot;Mr. Lauder (Newcastle) writes:- &quot;Trade Union representatives         already are expressing some dissatisfaction at the first         quota of Substitution Volunteers not being expeditiously         dealt with.&quot;Mr, Wilson (Scotland) writes--  &quot;The Edinburgh Sub-Committee are         dissatisfied with the present position which allows the         Employment Exchange to fill all the best positions first,         and only allows them to offer substitutes for the less         desirable and lower paid jobs.  There is a good deal to         be said for this point, which will to some extent hinder         the supply of substitutes from certain Trades Committees.&quot;WOMEN&apos;S SECTION,(a)  Womenfs Amy Auxiliary Corps.   A letter was received fromLord Derby on the 24th instant stating that he proposed in futureto entrust recruiting for the Women&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps to theEmployment Department, the Minister of Labour having Informed himthat ho could through the Employment Exchanges supply all thewomen required without any assistance from the National ServiceDepartment.    In accordance with this decision a preliminary con-feronce with representatives of the Ministry of Labour has beenheld and arrangements for handing over to them this portion of therork of the  Women&apos;s Section will be completed at the  earliestpossible moment.(b)  Land Army.    Recruiting figures for the  Women1s  Land Armyare as  follows*-                England   ...    ...    38,067                Scotland  ......     3,173                Ireland   ......        42                        Totals       gTTggg27.7. 117.
