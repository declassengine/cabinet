Italy, Pranee and ourselves may  scrape up  40  more divisions for  the West front, thus leaving 50 te be found  by  America  to  equalise ftrees,       ^     I  think this makes too  favourable  a, situation fojp tile enemy. I doubt if, in the war, all th* enemy divisions e&amp;n    fought away from Russia,  and, ef pourae, many  factors; enter infcr the caso ether  than the mere number  of divisions.   On  the&apos; other hand, I am sure that Amerioa  cannot,for  two years  or  mo ** put and keep 50 divisions  in the field in Prance, but I.did not press -this point at the  discussion  so as not  to  discourage  eithtr the&apos;French or the Italians.     I  think it very necessary  that the  British, French and Italian (xoverrimqnts should review.the .war&apos;;.a^ft&quot;of*?1^jaaAont^-:--as early as possiblenand let tbaemJ&amp;e.;^                            out.

yiTT.TiPAHY CONFERENCE OF gjth. JULY.      Present:-General Cadorna,General Sir Wo Robertson.General Pushing.General Pctain.General Fcoh.     The  events  which  are  now  taking plaoe  on the  Russian frsntrender it necessary far  the  Ccalitien to examine the policythat it would  adept if Russia  were  temporarily,  or permanently,forced out of  the  War:     The  most  unfavourable contingency should be considered  i.e.the case  in which  the  CentraL  Powers tfould remain intact and freett dispose of  their en;ire f roe-   it being understood that theremight be  intermediate  ^ases -  tor example,  the Central Powersmight not remain intaoo,  or they might bo obliged to retain acertain number of corps;  either in readiness against or in accupa..tion of Russia,  thus modifying the situation to our advantage.     The  fall  6f Russia  would entail the following consequences:POLITICAL.   It would modify the political aims of the Entente.It is therefore suggestod that the Governments ahtuld at tneeconsider     decide v;hat would bo the new political aims to bepursued.ECONOMIC.    It would place at the disposal of the Central Powersthe vast resources of Russia,  especially grain, and therobygreatly minimise the efficiency of the blockade.MORAL.       it might result, especially in the case of thesmaller Alliesj in&quot;the Palkans, in a profound depression whichmight cause them to seek a separate peace.  It is practicallycertain that Rumania would be compelled to share the fate tf Russia,and that, in consequence( the Bulgarian forces, and even a certainnumber of Turkish divisions, might be free to augment the forcesat the enomy&apos;s disposal.MILITARY.    The following oventualities should be considerod:      (a)   WESTERN. PROMT, (AftGLO-FBEUCH.             The enemy may be tempted to bring to bear his           maximum effort on the Anglo-French front before the           arrival of the main b*.dy  of  the American Army.  It  is           estimated  that the Germans and AuBtrians on the Eastern           front could be conveyed towards France at tho rate  of           16 divisions a month.             Supposing that tho&apos; Russian defection should take           place on 1st. October,  the  enemy vould have collected           all his forces, i.e. 273  divisions exclusive of           Bulgarian  divisions, on tho  &quot;Jostorn front by June 1918.           .^  r,this  caso the decisive  struggle will take place on           the France-British front, and the Coalition will have           to decide  to leave on all the other frants only the           minimum forces required for  their defence.             The timely concentration on the Anglo-French front of           toroes collected from overseas, is ossentiallv a           question of tonnage.           4-^If/.tSi8Jecision iB taken  immediately following upon           Ite defection of Russia,  and if adequate tonnage is           available  the Allies will maintain in Franco the superl-           ni^?iUV0 J?nwary l8t 19*S. which they will subse-           lst June 1918   a gradually  increasing proportion up ttFrtm
        From this  date onwardB the  disproportion will decrease     at the rate of  the arrival of  the American contingents. .     It is therefore at this  latter date - 1st June,1918 -     that the numerical superiority of the enemy will reach     its maximum,  which may amount  to from 40 to 50 divisions.        Three years1 experience of  the war has shewn that such     a numerical superiority  will not suffice to break through     a well-organised defence, (l).         Wee mtowirdi *mk imjyueiwC)         The numerical superiority  which the enemy can bring     to bear ori the  Franco-British  front, will, however, be     greatly reduced if the Italian Army, which, in the case     under consideration,  has about 40 Austrian divisions     opposed to it,  is prepared to  lend the support of all ,     or part,  of the divisions at its disposal behind the     front.         It  may, therefore,be presumed that the Anglo-Franco -     American forces,  will be able  to resist the German     onslaught,  but  they cannot b   expected at first to do     more thah obtain a successful  defeneive.(b).  ITALIAN FRONT.          Instead  of concentrating  their main effort against     the Franco-British front,  thi  Central Stapires may carry     out a heavy attack against Italy,  and concentrate against     her vastly superior forces;  either, by collecting in the     Italian V/ar theatrs all  the Austrain forces;  or,  in the     endeavour to  deal a more deoieive  blow,  by adding to the     Auetrain forces German divisions.          These German or Austrian forces Beem capable of     concentrating on the  Italian frbnt at the rate of 10     divisions a month;  these concentrations  can therefore     easily  be carried tut by the time  whsn the weather will     allow of  the  resumption  of active  operatione  (15th May)                                                            By1).  It should moreover be noted that the extent of fronts that cans  attacked will always remain subordinated 4o the artillery resourcesnd that the numerioal superiority of divisions realised by the enemy)uld merely enable him te maintain and renew hit attasks. If,however,ie desire te utilise to the full his numerical superiority shouldccite him to extend his front of action to Switzerland, and tottempt on our wing an outflanking manoeutaa On a large scale, thenie allied counter-stroke which has already been considered, will beaunched. By this date the Italian Army would be able, if it increases the number of its divisions proportionately to its output of artillery (aa its Commander-in-Chief Beema to intend to do) to oppose from 80 to 90 divisions to thesiemy^ forces.    Under these conditions, Italy might be able to reeist the enemy1e attack with her own resources, or, if need be, with the aid of allied contingents, the numerical importance of which should not be beyond their means. MACEDONIAN FRONT.    The enemy may be tempted to carry out before thewinter an offensive intended to be deviBive against theMacedonian Front.                                                  The/
      The question to &quot;be solved when the Russian defection      takes place will he:      Whether, to maintain on the ftont all the allied forces      then there:      or, to withdraw immediately troops to be sent to the      Western front-.        This will call.for a decision, in accordance with the      principle  announced in para, (a) of concentrating the      maximum of force on the Western front, which will be      urgent and of  capital importance.(d)*   ASIATIC-TURKISH FRONT.        On these fronts it will be necessary to apply implicitly      the principle  laid down above,i.e., to reduce to a minimum      the forces operating in the secondary theatres.  It will      rest with  the  British Go-yernment to take decisions in      conformity with the general interests.
          (1).C 0 N C LUS IONS.l9        Victory  against  the  Central Empires  may ho  either     mere  remote or less  decisive  than vi&amp;s  hoped  for.          The  political  and military aims  of tho Coalition     should  ho  modified accordingly.2.        In the eventuality of Russian defection allowing     the enemy  to ccn%rey  hack to the  Western  front the total     Of Gorman  and  Austrian troops at present employed on the     Russian front,  the Coalition  should bo a&quot;oj.e  tc assemble     tho military force necessary  to. resist the  enemy1s     onslaught,  until  America can  bring  into  line sufficient     troops  to  re-establish the situation to  the  advantage of     tho Coalition.3,          This  relatively favourable military situation can     only  beohtamod if the following measures  are adopted:     (a).    Adoption of a purely defensive  attitude in the     secondary  theatres and reduction of the  forces in those     theatres to  that  necessary for defensive purposes.     lb).    Acceleration  to its maximum  of the  preparation of     the American Army and  of the  transport of  American troops.     Tnis  question  of  transport should be immediately  examined     by an Inter-allied Shipping Commission.     (a).    Preparation of  tho  necessary tonnage  for the     conveying  cf troops  withdrawn from  the secondary  theatres.     (d).    Realisation cf  unity of action  on the Western front     by the  help  of a  permanent Inter-allied  military  crgan-     isation, which will  study  and prepare  tho  rapid movements     of troops  from one theatre to another.            These conclusions have in view the  measures to be     adopted in the case  of Russia beinp forced out of the war;     but nevertheless  fsteps of  both a military  and a general     nat-ure should betaken to  support Russia,  and avoid boin*     faced with the eventualities  considered  in the present     Koto.                                          1            These moasures  v/ere considered  in Memorandum No. 2,     handed  to  both the French;  and British  Governments.
SECRET.         ADDENDUM TO THE MILITARY1  CONFERENCE                   OF  JTTLY  2 6 tho          General Pershing  said  that if transport is available6 American divisions  and perhaps one or two  more  will be in Franco  by tho  end of the year and  20 divisions by 1st June1918 (including the sir in  1917).          As to arrivals after 1st June 1918,  General Pershingsaid that ho had no doubt but that America would continue tofurnish divisions up to tho limit of her resources but ho couldgive no information as to the transportation problem.  Hethought it however possible that 25 or 30 more divisions couldbe transported to Franco after 1st June 1918.
