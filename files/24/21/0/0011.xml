Information Bureau.SECRET.Department of Intelligence.       FSW/008.11   8.WEEKLY  REPORT  ON  SP^IEJuly 25th,  1917.    A fortnight  ago  I  quoted Signor Dato&apos;s reply to the CatalanSenators  &amp;  Deputies  who  announced their intention of meeting as akind of miniature  Parliament at Barcelona on July 19th.   Itdeclared  that  such a meeting was illegal and hoped fthat theorganisers  will  refrain  out of patriotism from summoning it&apos;.   Thequestion  then  was  whether t is politeness  was born of weakness orof strength.   The day has now como and gone,  and it is stilldifficult to be  sure of  the answer.   On the one hand some eightySenators  and Deputies, after trying in vain to hold their meetingat the Sjuncil Hall  and  elsewhere,  dti succeed in getting togetherin another  place and apparently in passing a series of Resolutions,protesting  against the refusal to convoke the Cortes,  against theCensorship  and against the view that their movement is a Separatistone;&apos;  and demanding  a  meeting of the Constituent Cortes * and theformation of a National  Government.   On the other hand they wereinterrupted in this  gathering by the arrival of the Governor whohad meanwhile  discovered their  place  of assembly.    He ordered themto disperse  and  on  thoir saying they  would only yield to force    The  Correspondent of $he Times, writing  on  the20th,  says  thatBarcelona  considers that it has gained a  decisive  victory ever  theGovernment and appears himself to share this view.    It  is fromhis account  that  the resolutions given above as having been passedreplied &quot;PorceJthat is myself *  on which they departed one by one.i&apos;a taXea.says that is spite of the Censorship,  rthe manifesto
6f the Assembly&apos;  is  being sold in Madrid.    Whether it is from thisManifesto&apos;  or  from  his^relations with Republican circles, sure tobe extremely anxious to  offer him information,  that he derived hislist of  the  Resolutions,  is  not clear.    But in any case, unlessand until  it is confirmed by Sir Arthur Hardinge, it will be wellto $ake  his  account  of the Barcelona rvictoryr  with considerablecaution.   He says that  &apos;the unanimity of the Assembly was absolute1- Assemblies which are passing previously prepared resolutionsin momentary expectation of  tho arrival of the  police,  unsually are.But in such  cases their  unanimity is not particularly impressive.It is too  early to be sure what really happened.    The Government feas-has issued a statement denying that  any real meeting took place.The TimesTaccount is by  no means inconsistent with the possibilitythat the whole  of the so-called meeting occupied a few anxious moments.and the  Resolutions  were merely papers  affairs,  hurried througho* taken as  read, wl&amp;h the object of enabling the party and itsfriends  at Madrid to publish exactly such an account as that whiohappears  in The  Times.    It concludes with a prophecy that SanerDato will  resign  and that if he doea not,  first  a general strikeand then a revolution will follow.    Only the future  can  show how much foundation there  is for thesehopes.   For the  moment  an observer,  judging from a distance,  andwith a vory  strict Censorship darkening his eyes,  can only say thatit is now  very  difficult  to  see signs of this in what happened atBarcelona.    The  &apos;day? wrs heralded  beforehand in revolutionarycircles  both in Spain and Prance as  one that was  to see very greatthingB and shake  Spain and even the  world.    But  the only knownhap-oen^JLng is a hole-and-corner meeting passing  a few hurriedresolutions  and dispersing quietly at the  bedding of authority.   . As
to  the  &apos;strike&apos;  there  is  said to &quot;have.T)aeja^8J0L^srtrte^^             -cada. in. one-^art of the town and  one man killed.    But that is allwe  hear of  disorder.    The  threats and hoasts of the revolutionaries,wW^i^oulated -leaflets calling for a rising of the populace on the19th, and the fears of those who-specially-insured their property,proved  equally  unjustified.    It  looks as if the whole affair weresomething of a  fiasco  if  it was meant xtobe the beginning of arevolution.   The  opinion of the  most competent judges both Englishand Spanish, including the  British ambassador,  that the bulk ef theofficers are not desirous of ^revolution, and that the men wouldprobably obey them, was evidently also the opinion of the Barcelonarevolutionaries, with  the result  that theprescence of a largemilitary force  proved  a convincing argument against carrying defianceof the  Government  further than was necessary for the purpose ofsaving  their faces.    There have  been strike troubles at Valencia andBilbao:  and no doubt  the Government would be very rash to assumethat it is  finally out of the wood.   But it may fairly congratulateitself  on the fact that the alarmist rumours circulated in anticipa-tion of July 19th  have so far proved prophecies as false as those ofa month ago, which announced dreadful things as certain to happen onJuly 1st.    But to  repress or  prevent disorder,  though the first duty of aGovernment, is  not the last;  nor even the most diffioult.   AGovernment which confines itself  to reprossing disorder deals onlywith the sympoms of disese  and leaves the causes untouched.   A quietJuly 19th at Barcelona is very far from proving Spain a healthycountry.   A groat city that requires 30,000 mBn and some warsai^sto keep it  in order On a  day of excitement will require medicine of
another sort to keep it quiet permanently.    Some way or other willhave to he found for dealing with the grave unre3t which undoubtedlyexists not only in Catalonia, but more or loss throughout the wholeof Spain.    The arrest of Senor LerrouxTs secretaries will not ex-tinguish the Republican party,  nor will Royal interviews and civilwords win back to loyalty its lately lost moderate elements, unlessthey are followed by a thorough change of attitude and a real reformof the system of Government.   A mere shuffling of the presentpolitical cards does n6t seem likely to satisfy the country.   Thedemand is for a new pack.   If the pro-Germans succeed in inducingthe King to get rid of Dato and call in Alba, who is said to be theman of $heir choice, whatever results that might have, it wouldnot satisfy those who are sick of the &quot;old gang&quot;, nand want both nowmenjand new measures.     And these actively dissatisfied people inolude, it appears,not only everybody outside the political ring but, if one may judgefrom the newspapers and interviews, a good many who have been insideit.   Not only ha3 the pro-German ex-premier,Maura, been abusing thewhole existing system for months but we find such a man as SenorSanchez de Toca, a pro-Ally Conservative and former minister, usingvery strong language on the subject.   He describes the State as&quot;nothing but a huge fiction in the midst of which everybody strivesto live at the expense of everybody else &quot; and declares that thePremier of Spain is created in the fashion of a Grand Vizier, thatthe parties are nominal and that the voice of the people finds noecho in Parliament, so thFtlthere is no real electoral body to workwith tho Crown lac^s the machinery for true Cabinet government.This sort of attitude on the part of such a man is sufficientlyserious in itself and made more so hy the fact that the unreal
machine of party government which he criticises,  the only machineof Government  whioh Spain at present possesses,  is being weakened bythe break up of  the parties which compose it.   Already for a long r&quot;H&quot; -time the Conservatives  have been split up into the official party Maura,  who has  rallied round him its more narrow-minded members andbitterly attacks Sonor Dato.   And now the Liberal r*arty is dividedinto twfr or even three sections.    The two late Prime Ministers,Count Eomanones  and the Marquis  of Alhucemas have definitely formedseparate groups;   and  it appears  that the ambitious Senor Alba whowas supposed to  adhere to Alhucemas has requested his friends tosupport  him personally,  as  his alliaaae with Alhucemas is only tem-porary.    The only party which has lately gained in unity and strengthis the Republican &quot;bloc1 which is of course outside this syetam.The machine,  therefore,  such  as  it is,  is divided against itself,  andthe only weapons the King has to  his hand,  without a radioal changeof system,  look  like being  rusty  if not actually broken.   The old&apos;easy and regular alternation  in office of the Liberal and th*kt!on-scrvative leaderw seems no  longer possible.     That,  together with much graver symptoms,  make moat judgesthink that in some way or other a radical change of system there mus&apos;-cbe.   There hat  been^much prosperity in Spain since the war,  but it hasnot come the way of the working classes who  have had to meet highpiijes with Itttle or  no increase of wages.    The landlords are  oftenselfish  and excoting absentees.    Promotions and appointments, bothcivil !ind military,  go almost entirely by favouritism.    This has  beenenrried  so far that it has  led to as absurd demand not  only on thepart of  the officers b^t even from the parish clergy for promotionby seniority.1   Unrest,  and unrest of the most  serious  kind,  is  everywhere:  in the offioers of  the Army,  as w^s  seen by the affair of  thewhioh follows the old leader Senor
 Juntas; among the 11.0.0*8 and men who have themselves sent in somewhat- startling manifestoes to the Juntas of officers:  in the politicians as is visible in their utterances;  among the clergy, professors and civil-servants who have all begun agitating about their griev- ances;  above all among the working classes, especially of the towns, where revolutionary feeling is said to increase rapidly and to be combined with hostility to the Monarchy end the King.     W at will the King do?  What can he do?   He is believed to have comtomplated abdication and actually discussed it with his family, who dissuaded him from it.   There does not appear to be any reason to think his departure would improve matters.   At ita worst the Crown is the one permanent element in the ever- ohanging political kaleidoscope of Spain.    It still has a prestige which nobody else can have.   And though the King&apos;s polularity has been shaken that has boon on political much more than on personal grounds.    If he oan adopt  a new line in public affairs he will probably be as popular es the Emperor Nicholas could certainly have been in Russia if he oould have forestalled the Revolution by                                                   alreadybeooming a Constitutional Sovereign.    King Alphonso/is  that in name.But if he is to save his  Crown and cave Spain from a violent Revolu- tion it looko ae if he must find  mcan3 to make the fiction :\ reality,Now that July 19th has safely prssed and the slack season in politics  is beginning he may have time to think things over and preparefor ? change.   If he  and his Minister,  whether Sono Bato  or  . .another,  could be ready in this autumn with real political,  and notonly political but social reformd,  and could convince tho country that they would be honestly and seriodely worked,  they might  yet navethe Monarchy and the peace of Spain.    It is reported indeed  that  when the King sent for Senor Ascarrete a week or two ago  to discuss  the
situation with him and ask his advice, he was frankly told by theveteran Reformist loader that he had made so many grave mistakes inthe past that a revolutionary movement for the abolition of themonarchy w?s now certain and even imminent, and that it was &apos;toolate1 to avert it by any stops which the King could take.   SenorAzcarrete obeyed the King&apos;s call to the Palace without consultingSenor Melquiades Alvares, the leader of the Reformist party but heis said to have told the King that his fatal mistake lay in nothaving made use of that party when it rallied to the Monarchy.  Toattempt to do so now, he said, would be useless:  the Reformistparty has in despair joined the Republican parties and pledgeditself to work for the fall of the Monarchy.   Any approach to it onthe King1s part would now be too late.   Senofc Azcarrete is anhonest man,  and no doubt if the report of this conversation isaccurate he was perfectly sincere in what he said.    But it isnevertheless difficult to believe thct a frank invitation fu?om theKing to the Reformists to form part of a National Ministry comingin on a programme of real reform would meet with a blank refusal.Anyhow, so far as foreigners can judge,  it seems plain that thisand not abdication is the policy the King sroald try.    &apos;7e of theEntente ought to be able to convince him of our sincere good wishes .for his success - For In spite of the extravagance of extremistpoliticians, ospocially in France,  no sensible friend of the Ententeoan desire a Revolution,   For oven if the men whom it brought topower were,  as thoy might be,  strong professed friends of the  Allies,it is very unlikely that they would bo strong enough at home to giveus any help of much value:   their rule would almost certainly bo dis-puted and disorderly:  and,  what is fof-ospecial importance,  it wouldcause such economic and industrial disturbances as  would reduce the
value of the exports  which the Allies desire to receive from Spain.There ought therfore  to be no difficulty in disproving the sillyrumours that the  British Government has financed or supported therevolutionary party.                                                      J. C. B.
