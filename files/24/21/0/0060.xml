SECRET. IVfDepartment of Information.         CRW/015,Intelligence Bureau,WEEKLY  REPORT  ON  RUSSIA.July 30th,  1917.Prospects of a National Government.   The old Coalition Government, which was more  Socialist  thanbourgeois, has proved a failure, and,  though various  attempts  havebeen made to reconstruct it  during  the last week,  they  are  not like-present  moment  its  basis  must be  very much wider than was that ofthe old  one.    This has been oroved by the break-down of Kerenskifsattempts during the last  few days to attract a few non-Socialistsinto less important posts in the  Government, so as to preserve atany rate the  name of a Coalition.    The continuance of the retreat.however,  makes  the  position far too serious for any experiments inCabinet-making  without a  fresh appeal to all classes.   The firstthing to be done was the  arrest of the Extremists to be followed bytheir exposure.   This appears So  far to have had the desired effect,and the  C.W.S.D. in Petrogred has  given the Government far strongersupport  than  it has hitherto,  having renamed it as a Government ofPublic Safety.   If the C.W.S.D.  is to retain its influence it willhave to  shake itself free more and more from any connection with theExtremists.   There are signs that theC.W.S.D.  realises its owndanger and is genuinely alarmed at the prospects of a counter-revolution coming from the Right.    This is probably the explanation3f its more vigorous attitude.   The new Government however does not intend to rely solely upon theCW.S.D. Such a step would undoubtedly isolate  nearly all the non-Socialists and  would increase the  dangers of a  counter-revolutionly to  succeed.For any Coalition Government to succeed at the
                              2.For this reason Kerenski is making a new a^tjeal to all classes ofthe community.    A National Assembly is to be summoned next week inMoscof at which not only the C.W.S.D. riid the Council of Peasants&apos;Deputies will  be represented but ,lso those bodies which representedRussian Liberalism before the Revolution viz. the Duma and the Unionsof Towns and Zemtava,    This apneal would appear to be the most en-cou: rging espect of the Russian situation, ss it prevents the bourgeoisparties complaining that they are being disregarded.   It is agenuine appeal to patriotism,  and it is to be hoped that the newvigorous Socialists such asKerensky and Tseretelli will be able tocome to terms  with some at least of the Duma leaders.   The re-appearance of  the Unions of the Towns and Zemtsva is one of the mosthealthy signs,  and these huge organisations mi^ht well be drawn uponfor vigorous members of a new National Government.    Dangers of a Counter-Revolution.       The spectre of a counter-revolution organised by the Right andsupported even by the Cadets has been very much in the foreground duringthe last week.    Kerenski is making superhuman efforts to prevent suoha movement,  which could not be accomplished without bloodshed on avery large scale..  Apart from the numerous agents of the old regimetherejare the Nationalist,  Octobrist and Cadet leaders who are thorough-ly disgusted with the influence of the Socialists.   They are backedby the industrialists who are faced with growing demands from theworkmen, and by the large landowners and peasant proprietors who havebefore them the prospect of expropriation.   The Cossacks who for themost part are  private holders will also resist any application of theprinciple of expropriation.    The peasants as a whole do not own the land they work, and Mr.Chernov^ programme of expropriation without compensation will receivevery widespread support.    It is no doubt for this reason that Mr.
 Chernov has been kept in the Cabinet,  though it is known that he does not share the vigorous views of Messrs. Eerenski and Tseretelli on the war.   It is probable that the sudden passing of Chernov^ agrarian programme was the fear of a counter-revolution, but this same programme will undoubtedly  form one of the chief stumbling- blocks to the success of the National Congress next week at Moscow. If so it may be that a compromise will be reached by which the land question will be postponed until the Meeting of the Constituent Assembly. The Military Situation.     The military situation must to a very large extent depent on the political.    The Germans will probably concentrate their attacks on what they consider the weak spots politically.   The settlement of the Ukranian question will certainly have a good effect on conditions in the rear of the armies in Galicia and it is well that the settle- taent was made before the German offensive.    foiother weak spet politically is Finland.   The danger of a German landing in Finland is considered a very real one.   Finland is chief- ly protected by mine-fields, as the Russian Baltic Fleet is hardly in a condition to be a match for the German.   There arc largo numbers of Russian soldiers in Finland, but thoy could not roly upon the Finns if the Germans succeeded in landing troops.   German agonts * are probably more numerous in Finland that anywhere, and the prexinity of Petrograd makes the Finnish coast a particularly attractive-spot for a German attack. The Ukranian Question.    Reference has ^ready been made to the effect of the recent,Iranian settlement on the Russian political situation.   The result of the settlement in the Ukraine has been the proclamation of the
Rada as the Ukranian Diet.    The merabers of the General Secretariat,which was appointed by the  Rada  on June 30th,  r.re now become membersof the Local Gevermnent of  the Ukraine.   The leading personalitiesin the New Government ore (1) Professor Grushevski, the President ofthe Rada, formerly Professor of  Ukrainian History in Lemberg University,known as &quot;little father&quot; of the  Ukrainian movement;  (2) VinnichenkotPresident of the Council and Minister of the interior, a Social Democrat&apos;and a leading dramatist;  (3) Yefremov, Minister of IUtejrhiitionEiAffairs, a Radical Democrat;  (4) Petlyura, Minister for War, repre-sentiitive of the Ukruni?n soldiers at the front who wish to form thea-selvea into a separate Ukrainian army.    The Sada has hitherto been rather unrepresentative, being toonational in a narrow sense,  but  as a result of the recent agreementwith the Russian Government representatives of the non-Ukrainiannationalities he. Great Russians t*nd Jews, are to be elected and areto receive 4 portfolios out of 11 in the Government.    This settlement may help to  strengthen the Government in Petrogradwho would be greatly embaraased  at the present moment by discontentin the Ukraine.    On the other hand it will make bitter enemiesof the Great xiuesian landowners  in the Ukraine.   The most prominentrepresentative of the latter is  Mr.  Shulgin, a Nationalist member ofthe 4th Duma, who has been  fulminating against the&apos;whole Ukrainianmovement in r series of articles in his paper Kievlyanin in Kiev,   Hedenies not only the separate Ukrainian nationality but ridicules theUkrainian language.   The whole  movement he describes as an Austrianplot under the leadership of Grushevski.   Thi3 is of course the pointof view of an extreme Russian nationalist who recognises neither thecultural nor political claims of the Ukrainians.   The cadets on theother hand while recognising the separate language end culture of theUkrainians are opposed to their  prenent political demands.   The
                           5.jie Russian nationalists object  to any recognition of the Ukrainianuestion,  while the Cadets insist that no settlement should be made til the  Constituent \ssembly meets.
