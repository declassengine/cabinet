ACT/013.DEPARTMENT- Of INFORMATIONINTSIJIGliSNOS BUREAU.WEEKLYREPORT  ON  GERMANY.July 17th.to  26th.  1917.THE NEW CHANCELLOR*It does not seem possible at this moment to sayanything of real value regarding the new Chancellor and thehew situation in Germany.  So far as it is possible to judgefrom the opinions of the German press which have been tele-graphed, German opinion is very much at sea;  it is not ]mownthere any more than it is here what the appointment reallymeans.   As an immediate result of the crisis, there aresymptoms of internal discussions and dissensions in the parties,especially in the Centre.   One thing is clear, viz: that theSocialists and the Radicals seize the point that the new Chan-oellor was appointed without reference to the Reichstag, andtherefore regard the appointmer.it as a r*rave slight to thatbody and an indication that there is to be no real control overthe Government by Parliament.   This is no doubt true.   On thewhole it would probably be safe to say that there is no realthought or polioy behind the appointment;  for reasons explainedalready, Herr von Bethmann Hollweg had become impossible;   prob-ably Ludendorff insisted that the military situation was muohbetter than was generally recognised;  it seemed, in Governmentcircles, essential to stop what might easily have become a com-plete dissolution of the whole structure, for this would have&quot;been the result of an unqualified acceptance of the peace  roso-lution in the sense that it was^an offer of peace to the Allieson the ground that the submarine campaign was failing, coupledwith an assertion of parliamentary control.   All that waspossible then was immediately to put in a strong Government man
 who  could  be  relied  on  to  &quot;carry  on&quot; with  greater  self- confidence, both in  the conduct of  the war and  in  resistance of fundamental  constitutional changes, than Bethmann-Hollweg had  shown.           The  situation is well  summed up in a telegram from Berne which communicatec the opinion of the Swics Minister at Berlin;  he reported that  &quot;the situation was still confused. The  fall of the ex-Chancellor might be considered as a victory for  the military party  backed by  tho Crovrn Prince, and as in- dicating a determination to continue the war.   The new Chancellor was a a capable and energetic man, by no means a creature of the military party.    It would be a mistake to imagine that change of  Chancellor meant a  step in direction of (?D emc c ra ti c)  ins ti tuti ons.&quot;           His appointment was then a sudden expedient to get out of an impossible situation.    In one senso,  therefore, it was a stop-gap appointment, but if he does well it maywell ha a permanent one.   As he is a new man,  no-one, not even those who selected him, can make any forecast as to  this.           It  may be noted that  the new Chancellor appears to be a man of strong religious  feelings;   he is said to  boPresident of the German brai^-ch of the Student Christian Move-ment.   This would imply that on many matters he would be in close personal sympathy with the Conservatives  and with those elements at the Court which were very prominent  in the firstyears of the present Emperor&apos;s reign,  whon, under tho influence of the Empress and Countess Waldersee,  a largo part was playedby influences  which the Germans  call &quot;fromm&quot;.    This  is notnecessarily associated with a definite  political programme,but it does certainly mean a personal bias  antipathetic bothto Liberals and Socialists.           The appointment appears to  be unpopular  in Austria;
 and  the suggestion is aiade in Austrian papers  that he is anti- Catholic,           L matter of immediate interest is the appointment of the new foreign Secretary;  it maj he assumed that Zimmer- mann will not he retained.   For this post several names have &quot;been mentioned, most prominently that of Count Rantzau, German Minister at Copenhagen, and it has even been suggested that he will very shortly sucoeed Dr. Michaelis as Chancellor.   A fairly favourable report as to him was received from the British Minister at Copenhagen; on the other hand a very adverse opinion was given by a private correspondent from Holland, and this has been confirmed from another private channel, a certain diplomatist who has been brought in contact with him having formed a very low estimate of his honesty and character.           The other most favourite candidate is Herr vonKuhlmann,  now German Ambassador at Constantinople.    He is of course well-known in England where he was Chancellor to theEmbassy at the outbreak of war.    He has the reputation ofbeing a profound Intriguer, and of course it was commonly sug-gaeted that while in London he acted very disloyally to hisChief,  and that it was on his reports rather than those ofPrince Lichnowsky that the German assumption was based that GreatBritain would not,  at least immediately,  enter  the  war,    Hisappointment would be  a very unfortunate  one  for Germany anddoes  not seem very probable.           The report last week was necessarily incomplete,and it would be desirable therefore to make  certain additions,both explanatory and  otherwise.BAVARIA AND PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL:           At the beginning of the  crisis, as was pointed  outin the last report,  the Centre Party agreed  to  follow the  lead
 of Srzberger, and  to  support  the  demands both  for a peace resolution and for increased  control by parliament.   m impor- tant  change was however caused by an article whioh appeared in the Bayrische Staatszeitung of July 12.  This article con- tained the following  passage:    &quot;However Justified in itself  may be the endeavour to   ensure to the peopled representatives a more vigorous   collafcbration in the shaping of the internal and external   policy of the German Empire, nevertheless every unpreju-   diced student of history and our constitutional life and   our party-conditions must admit that the grafting of a   Parliamentary system on to  Germany is an impossibility, and   that it would be a measure which would imperil most grie-   vously the existence of the German Empire.&quot; It then quoted with approval Bismarck1s statement that the restoration of a Parliamentary regime would be the sure pre- lude to the ruin and disintegration of the German Empire;  and continued: -    &quot;Such encroachment into the foundations of the Federal  State oharacter of the German Empire would endanger its   sxistenoe most grievously, and must therefore from the  outset be rejected most resolutely as unacceptable.    The   case, however,  is different as regards measures,  which,  with-  in the limit of the Federal State character of the Empire,  as guaranteed by solemn treaties,  offer a guarantee  for the  intimate collaboration of the Imperial Government and the  people&apos;s representatives,  and which can be greeted as being in  the interest and welfare of the Empire.&quot;           This naturally had great weight, and it  had theimmediate  effect of detaching the Bavarian members  of  theCentre from the demand for increased Parliamentary  power.           We can note then the general point that  the Centrewere compelled to dissociate themselves from the demand forincreased parliamentary control.    As soon as we get beyondthis general point and attempt to discover the  precise formin which their objections  took shape,  we find ourselves  involved
 in inextricable difficulties.   It would be impossible to diecuBB these within the limits of this report;  one point, however, may be mentioned as illustrating them.   There was much talk in the papers of the establishment of some kind of formal Council or Reichsrat, with Consultative rather than executive duties, by which chosen members belonging to differ- ent parties in the Reichstag should be brought into closer connection with the Government.   Mention of this was omitted in the last report as it appeared to be merely one of those suggested compromises which Batisfy no one, only serve for themoment to obscure the situation,  and are soon put aside.   As amatter of fact it seems to have disappeared very soon after itwas introduced.           Sow the curious thing is that we do not know whetherthis suggestion waB one put forward by the Centre Party as ameans of getting connection between the Reichstag and theGovernment without establishing direct parliamentary controlover the Government,  or whether this was the particular formof parliamentary control against which the Bavarians protested.                                               *Sir Walter Tomiley in a telegram of July 18, says:    &quot;Bavaria is greatly opposed to creation of Councils which  it is proposed to create as a sort of hyphen between Chan-  oellor and Federated States Governments.    It fears the Minis-  ters appointed might attempt undue interference with private  affairs of States.    Also that  tendency would be  towards still  further Prussianising existing  method,    Bavaria  is always  trembling lest her  own speoial  privileges in Federation might  be jeopardised by reform of any kind.&quot;On the other hand,  a  private letter from a well-informedsource gives us the following aooount of what  happened    &quot;(At the time of  the German Emperor^ visit to  Austria)  The Vienna Cabinet  had reason for believing  that  tho question  of a responsible  Imperial Government would bo supported by  Bavaria and assisted by Wfirtemberg and Saxony.    After  his  return to Berlin, the Kaiser made it clear to the Bavarian  Minister,  Count Lerchenfeld,  that a responsible Government  for the Empire would moan tho curtailment of the  Reservat-          &quot;the particular privileges of the  Federal  States.  Count Rertling, who was urgently Buiaaonod to Berlin,  had to  accept the compromise in the form of a  parliamentary body  to  aot as an intermediary bet^on  tho Reichstag and  the Imperial
  Government.   It is incorrect that Count Hertling proposed  this compromise, hut he accepted it as against the other  alternative whioh meant the relinquishing of important  privileges.&quot;           It will be seen that these two versions are inconsis-tent with one another, and it seems at the present moment im-possible to determine which of them is correct, or if both areincorrect, and the suggestion really comes from Bavaria.           While then we know little of the details, thegeneral point is one of fundamental importance.   The Centre hasalways strongly supported the federal oharacter of the Empireand has opposed all suggestions for increasing the power of theCentral Imperial authorities.   It was in fact to support thispolicy that the party was originally founded.    It has thereforethroughout its existence been in strong opposition to all theLiberal Parties, and especially to the National Liberals, whoare, by tradition and conviction,  the advocates of strong cen-tral control.    The immediate reason for this  sudden declarationof policy was  obviously the apprehension that  any increase inthe direct power of the Reichstag over the Government would en-danger the special rights reserved to Bavaria  under the Constitu-tion.    This declaration was also  no doubt very welcome to thePrussian Conservatives,  who equally are opposed to anythingwhich would increase  the power of  the Imperial authorities overPrussia.    We  get then Prussian particularism  being supportedby Bavarian particularism.           This episode shows the  extreme difficulty of gettingany strong organised  and permanent majority in the Reichstagfor any definite policy.    Such a  majority is  practically im-possible without the  cooperation of the Centre;   the Centre,however,  is drawn now towards the  strongly democratic Catholiosof the Rhine Province,  and has to  appear sufficiently democraticto keep their  support;   noW it is  drawn towards  the BavarianGovernment with its strongly federal prejudices.    This  fundamen-tal division among its  supporters  makes it impossible for the
 party as  a whole  to  adopt  any clear-cut,  definite policy, and all that  it can  do  is  to  manoeuvre  BO as  to  meet the situation as  it changes from  week  to  week or  even from day to  day.            The one thing we may  say about the Centre Party is  that it never  could  be  Liberal;  ih  its whole spirit, as in  its  origin, it is a  permanent protest  against Liberalism, a protest especially on religious matters, but also  in its defence of the local differences represented  by  the  federated states.    On the  other  hand,  it  has a etrong  democratic tinge; it  is capable of  going  for support, as  the Catholic  Church has done in Belgium and in  Ireland,  to the  people  as  opposed to the well-to-do;  it cannot  afford to lose touch with the  working men;  it  will stand up  against the Conservatives  on  such matters as  the treatment of Alsace-Lorraine,  the  Poles, the ill-treatment of  the natives in  the German Colonies.           The difficulties arising from the  composite nature of  the Centre Party are equally prominent in relation to war aims.   There can be no doubt that Erzberger was  influenced by Austrian and Bavarian opinion, and there was reason for supposing that he might have been expressing the views of a general Catholic  movement towards peace.   ?/e have now a definite denial that he was in any way acting on  the sugges- tion of the Vatican;   we get the statement in an Austrian Catholic paper:   &quot;It is absolutely untrue that the Holy See is aiding a peace movement on behalf  of Austria.&quot;   The Popehimself is said to have seen this draft and approved of it-On the whole,  therefore, it is probable that he representedthe genuine desire for peace on the part of the more authorita-tive and aristocratic wing of the party, and also was anxiouslest if he did not make some declaration,  the  working-menmight be led to  transfer their allegiance  to  the  Minority
Socialists.   Now, however, we hear of a strong protest withinthe Party, which comes from the Chauvinist Wing representedby the well-known Kolnisohe Volkszeitung:  &quot;Among wide circlesof the Rhine Centre Party Herr Erzberger&apos;s procedure is feltas a blow in the face, and it is generally regretted and con-demned in the bitterest manner.&quot;   This statement, however,  igfound in the notorious Rheinisch Uestffillsohe Zeitung, perhapsthe most extreme war paper in Germany.
