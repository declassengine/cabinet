Mmc if-:SEC RET.29.7.17.Handed in 5.27 p&quot;.m.No.1164.       Following is a literal translation of letter from C.G.S.to General Barter.  Begins. &quot;In spite of technical and numericalsuperiority of our army and the- steps taken to ensure certainand large success, the local successes which we have gained couldnot he developed.  On the contrary, enemy was able to takeoffensive and break our line.  In spite of the immediate andenergetic measures taken at present time to remove thefundamental reasons for the moral collapse of the army, goodeffects cannot be produced on troops in sufficient degree tobring lasting and reliable results quickly, especially onmost important section of the ?front, where the army, whichhas lost all cohesion, is retiring under the most difficultconditions.  It would be impossible to bring up in short timereinforcements to the threatened section in sufficient numbersto restore balance of strength owing to scarcity of railwaysand their small carrying power.       It is therefore impossible to check advance of the enemy.For this reason, under present circumstances the only thingleft for us to do is to withdraw our troops from enemy&apos;s attacks;to retire in good? time neighbouring armies, in order toavert risk of them being out-flanked and cut off and toconcentrate fresh and reliable troops taken from other partsof line, at a considerable distance from front, in order toconstitute final barrier tc further advance of enemy into theinterior.  In view of extreme? undesirability in our mutualinterests of affording Austrian-German armies the possibilityof gaining fullest advantage from present position, and ofnecessity of preventing at all costs the development of hissuccess and saving remainder of armies on south west frontfrom defeat and extreme danger, under present conditions, ofthe deterioration of fighting powers and morale of the troops,the C. in C., has ordered me to ask your Excellency to urgethe British C. in C., in the strongest possible terms toundertake as soon as possible the most energetic operations onAnglo-French front, in order to draw off German forces fromour front, and to keep in view the fact that, further enemysuccesses may have most&quot;unfavourable results for the alliesmutual interests&quot;.
