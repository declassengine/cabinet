Sir J,B.Jelliooe, G.C.B.,&amp;c,first Sea Lord &amp; Chief of thellaval Staff^ral Sir W.R.Robertson, G.C.B., &amp;c.,Jhiof of the Imperial General StaffFrance,.Admiral de Bon,  Chief of the Staff, French NavyGeneral Fooh, G.C.B.,  Chief of the General  Staff,  French Army.oirol Thaon di RevelAmerica,Admiral Sims    The review of  the maritime  situation and the very clear eszplanationsvan by Mr* Graeme  Thomson show  that  we  have to face a total monthlyAuction (Allied and neutral  countries)  which can be estimated at 500i000yns for the high sea tonnage.    In the first instance Mr. Graeme Thomson, on behalf of the Ministry Shipping, is of opinion that it will be possible to meet the requirements the supply of the United Kingdom  (limited to those which are absolutelyceesary) until October 1918t provided that new construction amounts to000,000 tons from  the 1st of January 1918.  For this it is essential thate necessary labour should be called  back from the British army and the,^eel required provided.  Mr.  Graeme Thomson states that for the period  v&apos;tending to October 1918 the  continuously reducing available tonnage willffice for imperative needs,  but the  people of Great Britain will undoubt-ly have to suffer  serious privations.  It will not be possible to make ancrease of imports  into Allied countries v/ith British tonnage.    From November  1918 - and with  the help of the Americans - presuming*ir shipbuilding programme comes up  to  expectations - wo may hope that thetal construction will approximately  compensate for the losses caused byomarines.    It appears from the above that the  situation will only begin to improveom November 1918,  and that until then the total available tonnage of thelies may be insufficient to  cover  all their requirements.    It is therefore indispensable  to establish a general list of the avail-   tonnage for each of the Allies and to put against it the figure ofV. -r*requirements.  Only then will  it be possible to take a decision as tos amount and the nature of the  restrictions which will have to be made in19 various fcinds of traffic.Furthr
    Further, the transport of the iUnorican Army to France has  createdm needs which we have to face.  On this particular account,  it isKjpensahle to draw up a statement of the total Inter-Allied tonnage,  andfe only when this is done that it will he possible to get an  idea of mount of transport, if any, which oan bo put at tho disposal  of theCcan Army in Franco; it seems, on a first examination,  that  theseIs will be limited solely to tho resources of the American mercantileEe a3 supplemented by their shipbuilding programme.    The members of the Meeting consider that is a most  important pointlh must be cleared up without delay, and ask that the Allied  Governmentsjld take at once the necessary measures to that of foot; &quot;tilth  this end inF a meeting of the representatives of tho Transport Servicos of theles should be held in London at the earliest opportunity.*-2
