Vice Admiral William S.Sims,         Commanding United States Haval Forces in Europe,                 London.  England.  My dear Admiral Sins,            Will you allow me to address to you an informal memorandum  in reference to the shipping situation of the Rolief Work for Belgium  and the occupied portion of France.            There are 7,700,000 people in Belgium and  ,000,000 people  in France who are dependent upon the Commission for Relief.            normally, Belgium imports two-thirds of her food supplies;  now her production has greatly diminished as compared with peace times.            Hormally, northern France was more than self-supporting,  but now the country has been so over-run and devastated hy war that  -  except for about two-thirds of the nativo wheat crop and a part of  the potato crop which the Germans ha-*e assigned to the civil  population, and except for some vegetables, etc, the whole country  is dependent on the importations of the Commission for its food.            The total food importations raqmred for Belgium and  France together amount tc 120,000 tons.monthly.            This is on programme of food importations approved by  the British, French and Belgian Governments submitted by the Corn-  mission as the minimum necessary to maintain the people without  serious physical deterioration.            It is estimated that all of the population of France  is destitute in the sense of depending on the importation for a  living ration and 5,000,000 of the people of Belgium.            As against the required import of 120,000 tone per  month of food stuffs, owing to the failure to obtain ships,  we  have only been able te get in the foilowing                                                        Average
 Average monthly for February, March, April &amp; May 43,000 tons June  ..    ..    .*    **     &quot;     &quot;    **   110,000 tons July  (expected total)  ..     ..                 65,000 tons     The result has been that all reserves and stocks on hand                   and have been exhausted/for the last three months the condition has been one of partial starvation grading to actual starvation in the industrial communities and among the very poor.     The resistance of the people of the occupied territories to the Germans has been heroic,  but under starvation their morale is being broken down, and 7/e have definite information that thousands are now going to work  for the Germans; there are po- tential workers for Germany here of some 500,000 men&apos;.     These people are now beginning to say that the British, French,  Belgian and United States Governments have abandoned them.Unless this,  depressing situation and the semi-starvation is remedied immediately, that is, beginning in August, the eonse- quences both political and military will be far reaching.     If the Belgians are allowed to become convinced that theAllies have largely abandoned them, can it be wondered at if they try to save the remnant of  their people by separate peaoe or compromise with the Germans - such eventualities are discussed.     There are 29 deputies from  Northern France in the FrenchAssembly.  If the 2,000,000 people whom they represent are starving can they do otherwise in the times of crisis which wemust expect possibly not far in  the future - than vote for im-mediate peace?      The conduct of the Relief  of the occupied territories ofBelgium and France is a direct part of the conduct of the war.      Owing to the various shipping controls which have recentlybeen developed, the commission iB no longer able to obtain neutral charters - except occasional ones.       We are only able to rely  on Belgian vessels for both France and Belgium.   Between three-quarters and two-thirds of the entire
entire3elgij&amp;2LJ arine has  heen^e^ulaJJ^ned-a^         over  tous by the Belgian Government.This produces monthly about45,000 tons.Other neutral charters produce about13,000 tons.For next 4 months we are assured of* *58,000 tonSiAs stated above monthly requirements are120*000 tons.     Leaving a shortage of monthly           ..   62,000 tons.     Tho tonnage must be promised immediately by the AlliedGovernments or they will in offset be starving their own Alliesand Countrymen while maintaining their home populations inluxury.   They are responsible to God and man to remedy thiscondition at once.     A project is under discussion for the Dutch Government tocharter to the Commission 80,000 tons of Dutch shipping whichwill produce about 35,000 tons monthly, but the proposal has beencoupled with condition that the United States guarantee to Hollandlarge allotments of food and raw material.  The result willundoubtedly be long discussions and no ships immediately.SUMMARY.-     The following action must be taken at once by the AlliedGovernments in order to avoid a situation of suffering and dis-pair for which they cannot afford to be responsible,     1.   The Allied Governments from the shipping now under theircontrol must at once allocate to the Relief Commission 62,000tons  .of shipping monthly in addition to our charters now held.     2.   Pressure must be put upon the Dutch, Swedish and otherneutral Governments to assign to the C, R, 3. Servico large -amounts of their idle or other available tonnage.  When suohassignments become effective the 62,000 tons provided by theAllies may be relieved.Yours faithfully,(Signed)B. POLAND.Director for Europe Commission   for Relief in Belgium.
