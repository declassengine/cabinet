COPY Off LBTTSli  PATSP 51st JULY 1917 ?HOI.: T3Ep5     SHIFTING COin-cOLLilT TO TEE; PitHOg MIFISTgi^ Dear Prime ninistor,           A note has been received from one of your private Secretaries asking for ray consents on the letter addressed to you by Lord Inchcape and other shipowners on tho 13th of this nonth.           The letter deals with three points, which though to some extent interconnected, may conveniently be taken separately in the order in which they are raised.            The firat relates to the present policy of building standard shipa.  These chips, it will be remofcbered, are confined to a few simple typto yjad aro built for Government order.  Lord Inchcape implies that substantially as good resultB could have been secured by allowing ship- owners to place their own ordere for chips suitable to their individual requiremente.  This contention is, in ray opinion, quite unsound.  Having regard to the situation as it existed in the early part of this year, it was cf paramount importance to concentrate on the construction of vessels which could be turned out in the shortest possible time, using a minimum ofmaterial and labour.            The opooifications of the standard chips were very carefully drovm up with this purpose in view and have successfully v/ithstood every criticiem.  The chips,  thoughprimarily intended to meet war conditions will he  thoroughly serviceable veseclo for cargo purposes after the war.   Theydo not,  of course, compare from the point of view of the Steamship Lines,  with vessels built to meet the requirements of speciel trades, but we need ships now to win the war,  notto carry on special trades.   At a later date,  if the
421 national  situation permits, there is no reason why ships should not he laid down of a somewhat more elaborate type and therefore better ouited for the Liner trades.  Indeed a  standard specification of ouch a chip wao prepared at my request 3ome months ago in readiness for eventualities. For the present, however, we must adhere to the simpler types whioh Gave time,  labour and material, the three all- important factors at the moment.              The second point in Lord Inchcape*s letter relates to the accumulations of capital in tho hands of the Shipping fima.  The acounulations referred to are.no doubt very large, including as they do the inauranoe values of ships lost, and it is suggested that they might,  with advantage to the Government and to the shipping interests, be invested in the ships now building.  X  think that in principle the suggestion has much to commend it.   The matter is, however,  perhaps one more for tho Chancellor of  the Exchequer than for ne,               Lord Inchcape&apos;s third point relates to the question of the status  of the I ercantile Liarine after thewar.  This question was raised in an earlier letter  fromLord Ihchcape, which I  submitted to  the War Cabinet,  andwhioh came under discussion yesterday,   A  decision was arrived at which I think disposes of the point  for thepresent,                Yours very  truly,                     (Signed)   J,P.  &amp;ACLAYTHE ET, HON.  DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,  k.P,
