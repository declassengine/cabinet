 Secret.                                        Intelligence Bureau.                                            Department of Information                                                    BAW/Oll         WEEKLY  REPORT  OK  AUSTRI A- RWGAR Y *  21                     July 27th, 1917.     The adjournment of the Reichsrat has been followed by a pausein the political development.   The question of ccnJtitutional reformappears to be buried,  at any rate for the present.   There is goodreason to believe that the J&amp;iperor himself is eager for an earlysolution of the political deadlock through the appointment of a newParliamentary Ministry:  but the attitude of the Slav parties stillremains the obstacle.    Even in the last few days the Czech leader,Baron Prazek,  (an ex-minister), re-affirmed the determination of theCDflchs to insist upon the programme of an independent Czecho-$Slovakstate.     The Vienna correspondent of the leading Czech paper communicatesthe details of an elaborate project for replacing the present provis-ional cabinet without further delay by a cabinet lof 24 members,  inwhich all the various nationalities and also the socialists would berepresented and which would at once proeeed to draft proposals for anew constitution and the regulation of the language problem.    It ishowever extremely improbable that any ouch scheme will materialize.     Several highly significant incidents occurred during the closingsittings of the Reichsrat.    A 6zech Socialist deputy denounced thelate Cabinet&apos;s policy of octroi (or constitutional coup d&apos;etat)  ashaving really originated &quot;with political generals,  who held that ordermust be produced in Austria with an iron hand.&quot;   While admitting ahuge improvement since the change in the Supreme Command,  he  appealedto  the new commander-in-chief to prevent generals  from meddling  inpolitics in future.
                               2.    The  Minister  of  the  Interior,  Count Toggenburg,  in answeringenquiries  about internment  and refugee camps,  admitted that there arestill 110,000  fugitives  living in  improvised camps,  and 330,000 morefor whomtthe various communes  are  providing.&apos;   It is probably safe toassume that the Minister followed  the  invariable Austrian practiceof understating an unpleasant  truth.    A later speaker, a Ruthenesocialist  Grigorovice, declared that the Magyars had behaved towardsthe unhappy fugitives from  Bukovina &quot;like their worst enemies&quot;,  andopenly expressed  his regret that they  had not remained behind,as theywould have been well treated by the Russians,  especially under thepresent  Governor, aRuthene  social-democrat.   Such language is the mor^remarkable in  view of the Austrophil tendency of mo3t Ruthenes.Everything goes to show  that the Austrian military regime has aliena-ted them even  more effectually than the folly of the Russian reaction-aries during the  first occupation  of Galicia.BOHEMIA.    The German-Bohemian deputies of  the two  houses of theReichsrat  have held  a meeting  in Prague,  in  which they declared  theirreadiness  to co-operate  with all elements which are  loyal to dynastyand state, and their desire to live in peace with the Czechs.    Thisthey hold  to be impossible  except  through the division of Bohemia intodistinct national districts,   and  the  consequent division of theBohemian Diet  and the local Administration.    They declared themselvesabsolutely opposed to Bohemian constitutional law as put forward by 1heCzechs.    Apart from this resolution,  speeches of the utmost violencewere delivered emphasising  the exasperation  of the Germans at recentevents,  and the hopelessness of reconciling  the Czechs by any kind ofconcession, and insisting that Austria must  be governed by the Germansor cease to exist.    In-contrast to this attitude it is interesting tonote that  at a conference of the Czeoh Social-Democrats in Prague thedeniocratisation of Bohemia  and the summoning of a Constituent Assembly
 lyere treated as  the  natural  step towards the reconciliation of Germans 321a Czechs,  and  stress  was laid upon the willingness of the Czechs to renounce  all interference with the affairs of the Germans of Bohemia in return for the  right of the united Czecho-Slovak race to.decide its own fate.    That  the Germans are still a long way from a really conciliatory attitude  may &quot;be  seen from a  decision of the German National League with regard to  the fierce attacks directed against its member the deputy Heine,  owing to  his  insulting exclamation in the House (when the number of executions in Galicia were estimated at 30,000) that far too few had been hanged.   Instead  of expressing regret at Heine&apos;s provocative action, the  League announced that in future it would    under no cir- cumstances tolerate  such treatment of one of its members. HARVEST  PROSPECTS.   Signs  of economic stress are becoming more fre- quent in  Austria.    There have been numerous riots of late, especially in the mining districts of Silesia.    The haycrop has been officially admitted  to  be a complete failure.    The shortage of vegetables is a subject of great complaint in Vienna    Expression is given to the alarm felt at the  poorness of the harvest ih an article by the deputy Vibos in  the ffeues Wiener Taffblatt,  the chief organ of the commercial middle-class.  On  the other  hand the harvest in South Hungary is reported  as  fair and in Roumania as splendid - this on the authority of the Swiss Foreign Minister in conversation with Sir Horace Rumbold. THE  FINANCIAL  OUTBODg.   A German deputy has put forward the demand that the  weekly  returns of the Austro-Hungarian Bank,  which have been suppressed since the beginning of the war,  should once more be  pub-lished.    This demand ha3 been taknehup in the press.    The nervousnessof the authorities in this respect is shown by their confiscation ofthe whole  of what  corresponds to the Time3&apos;  City Uetes in the Neue
Frfeie Presse  -  a step almost without precedent.    This jumpiness isdoubtless due to the vory wide spread distrust of the currency towhich official suppression of financial figures and a desire to concealthe facts as to  the over-i3Sue of notes have given rise.   In recentmonths there appears to have been very heavy speculation on the ViennaBourse,  especially in industrial  securities, and the financialsituation generally is highly unsound.   (For further details see Mr.Max lfflller&apos;8 very interesting summary for June 24.)PEACE  FEELIMGS. The wide spread  longing for peace which prevailsthroughout the Monarchy is reflected in recent speeches of the Austrianand Hungarian Premiers.   Two signs of the new spirit in Austria -which contrasts  very markedly with that still noticeable in Germany -are worth special reference:  (1) The proceedings of the Reichsratwere closed by a brief speech from the President, Dr. Gross, whosevery selection for that office has been quite seriously treated byGerman writers as a deliberate attempt to wreck Parliament.   It wasthis uncompromising Jingo who laid jpeoial stress on &amp;ustria&apos;s warmdesire for peaoe and her purely defensive war-aim3.   Their chiefobject,  he said, was &quot;a permanent peace which will leave no hatredbehind it and will unite all nations once more in a common work ofoivilisation.&quot;    Even if he spoke merely&quot;to order&quot;,  as is quite possiblo the change of tone cannot be ignored.      (2)   Even the fleue Preie Preaee.  which has always done  so much to fan racial hatred,  gives prominence to  a remarkable article  by Professor Pflrater of Munich,  which ie a plea for Europe^  return to sanity and opens  with a  reference to  the Austrian Emperor^ amnesty as &quot;the first noble word spoken  in Europe  since  August 1st, 1914&quot;. His  main argumeni is that the recent  Russian offensive cannot be explained by bribery ot  threats,  as the  Jingoes  of Central Europe
would fain explain it,  but only by &quot;the deep distrust felt by theEntente peoples&quot;.   The only thing, he argues, which will createtrust is &quot;a really elementary movement in favour of a new conditionof life among tbe peoples&quot;,  and the action of the Emperor is treatedas such.   though Hrstet is not a politician and though his herd mayseem to be too much in the olcuds, it ie right to ooint cut that heoccupies o special niche in Austrian public opinion;  for he c*sme fromMunich to Vienna as a professor 3ome years before the war with thesimultaneous approval of Catholics and freethinkers (an almostuniane-instance of this in Austria) and withdrew again to Munichwithin two years after stating his opinions upon Austrian racialproblems with a frankness and breadth of vision which gave intenseoffense to the extrome German Nationalists, but awakened an echoamong all thinking Auetrtans.   The fact that the Iteue Freie Pressepublished his article is almost certainly a concession to publicopinion;  but that it does not mean a real change of spirit  on thopart of the leading Vienna newspaper is proved by its tone in a morerecent article,  violently denouncing Mr, Lloyd George as the chiefobstacle to peace.    AUSTRIA-HUNGARY &amp; SOUTH  GERMANY.  It is announced that anEconomic Conference is being held in Tienna between Austro-Hungarianand German official oeraonages (notably Mr. de Meroy,  late Austro*Hungarian Ambassador to the Quirinal and Count Wedel,  the GermanAmbassador in Vienna.) fcr the purpose of discussing post-war economicconditions.   Ita alleged aim is to devise counter-measures to theAllies1 Economic Conference in Paris last year,  but-of course noreliable details ore to hand.   It is clear, however,  both from pub-lic and confidential eouroes, that the question of 8entral Europeanwaterways - and especially the question of linking up the upperDabube by a canal (of the Ilanohester Shipping Canal type) with the
I  Main and Rhine on the one hand.. and with the Oder and Elbe on theIm  QfoQY - figures more and more prominently in all economic discussions   between the Central Powers.   There is. however, considerable   divergence of opinion:  Hamburg,  Saxony, and Eastern Germany as a   whole favour the second project,  ?/hile Bavaria naturally prefers the   Rhine project and tends to combine it with her uolitical ambitions   in Alsace-Lorraine.   It is also possible that Catholic influences   play their part in BavariaTs tendency to link up with the Rhineland   and with Belgium be^dnd it.   The whole oroblem is, cf course,   intimately connected with the formula of &quot;no annexations&quot;.      AUSTRIAN  WAR-AIMS,   In this connection the new programme cf the   Austrian Navy League is deserving of attention.   This programme falls   into two halves - an Adriatic and a Danubian.   Peace, it is dealared,   must bring to Austria-Hungary the assurance that Italian influence   shall gain no foothold on the East of the Adriatic and that Russian   influence shall not cut the Dual  Monarchy off from the mouths of the   Danube either politiiolly, strategically or economically.  ThisIgeneral principle is interpreted in the following manner:      (1)  Mount Lovoen mu3t remain Austrian, and Antivari, Dulcigno,   San Giovanni di Medua and Durazzo must bo under the military control   cf Austria.      (2)  Albania and Montenegro ere not to remain independent, unless   bound by such close military and economic chains to the Dual Monarchy   a3 to bo incapable of entering any hostile combination:  while the   South West Frontier must be modified in such a way as to -protect   Trioste from the dangers we which this war has shown it to bo exposed.      (3)  The continued existence  of Serbia as a State is open to very   grave objections, but even in the event of her surviving,  Austria-J   Hungary must at any rate annex the whole right bank of the Save,   including Belgrade and the right  bank of the Danube from there to
Semondria, while both Serbia and Rumania must be deprived of the right and left banks of the Danube from the Iron Gates to below Turnu-Severin. Serbia and Rumania must only be allowed to exist on condition that they  accept rulers not hostile to Austro-Hungarian interests and enter into military, economic and political agreements with Austria-Hungary for anlong period of years. This and a limitation of the International Danubian Commission to the riparian States under the control of Austria, Hungary, Bavaria and Wurttamberg, is essential to the Monarchy&apos;s Danubian interests. Such demands obviously fit in with the canal projects alluded to above.

HUNGARIAN POLITICS. There are fresh rumours of a crisis inside the new Hungarian Government and of proposals for a compromise on electoral reforms between the Government and Count Tisza&apos;s Party. The alleged basis is  that the Reform Act of 1913 (which has never yet been put into operation) should be merely extended by certain concessions to the industrial workmen; that the elections under the new low should not be held until after the war; and that it should be left to the new House thus elected to draft a fina1 scheme of reform. On the basis of some such scheme of "shelving" reform, which would be thoroughly in keeping with numerous precedents in Hungarian politics since 1905, there is already talk of a reform group being formed inside the Tiszo Party, such as would give the Government a majority and avert new elections. It remains to be seen whether so obvious a case of collusion would be tolerated by the few genuine advocates of reform for its own sake.
