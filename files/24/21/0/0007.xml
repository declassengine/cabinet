PORT AND  TRANSIT  EXECUTIVE               COMMITTEE.TRANSPORT WORKERS&apos;  BATTALIONS.     The  Port  and  Transit Executive  Committee  has  been charged  by the Prime Minister Avith the duty of  maintaining the flow  of traffic through  the ports of  Great Britain; and to assist the Committee in the discharge  of this duty, the War Office has placed at  its disposal  the men  of the  Transport Workers&apos; Battalions.     The regular flow of traffic through the ports  of  this country must be maintained to enable the  nation to exist, and the war to be won.  It is through the ports that the greater part of  the supplies of  the Army must be sent, and, to enable such supplies to be prepared in this country, the greater part of the food, and of the raw material out of which the munitions are  made,  must be first imported.  It is through the ports that the greater part of the food of the nation, and of the raw material  required to keep the mills and factories at work, must be obtained.   It is through the ports that  our manufactures and coal must  be exported to pay for the food and raw materials we must obtain from abroad.    Further, it  must be borne in mind that the detention of a ship, whether  British or Foreign, in port  lessens ^its  yearly carrying power, and thereby  tends to diminish supplies and to force up  freights and prices.  So  many ships are  being used for war purposes that  it has become of the utmost  importance that those left for trade should be made to carry as many cargoes as possible ;  this can onljr be done if the ships are turned round in the ports as quickly as possible.   The shipping tonnage now remaining available after the war  demands have been satisfied, is  not sufficient to provide forthe needs  of the nation,  and this is one of the reasons for thecontinued rise in prices.  The additions to the number of shipsby fresh building cannot compensate, for some considerable time,     o  (; 3) AS 3459 (AS 2494)  Pk 9 8CO0   7/17 E&amp;S  (S)      A
even  for the  wastage from war and  marine perils.  But thecargoes brought into the ports can be increased at once if theships now remaining available are turned round more  quickly,and thereby enabled to make more frequent voyages.    This applies to all vessels, whether under British  or foreignflags, as about  one-third of our total imports are brought inships under foreign flags.    For these reasons,  all  ships  in  all  ports in  the UnitedKingdom must be discharged  and loaded  with  the utmostpossible despatch.  No custom of a port or trade  practice mustbe  allowed  to interfere with  obtaining the utmost  possibledespatch.   Cargoes must be removed promptly from the quaysand transit sheds so  as to permit of the handling  of  othercargoes.    The carts, motor lorries, railway wagons,  and canal bargesused  in the  distribution of  the  cargoes must be  handledpromptly    There must be a general speeding up of work.    Under the instructions of the War Cabinet the  strength ofthe Transport Workers&apos;  Battalions has been brought  up to10,000.  Men are therefore available for work in the ports, onthe railways  and canals, and at the iron and steel works inconnection with  the handling of oversea supplies of ore.    The conditions under which  the  men  of  the TransportWorkers&apos; Battalions will be employed will remain as  set forthin the Instructions issued by  the Port and Transit ExecutiveCommittee on the 4th August 1916, namely:  \    A Transport Workers&apos; Battalion will not be used to supplantthe existing labour supply it will only be used ito supplementsuch  labour  when  necessary  to  maintain the flow of  trafficthrough a port.  The Battalions are  Military Units  and thewithdrawal of  the men  from  their Military duties must  beavoided so far as is practicable ;  therefore the.Port and TransitExecutive Committee rely with  confidence on the  hearty co-operation of the Employers and  Labour  so  that the  work ofthe port may be done, so far as is possible&apos;, by Civilian Labourand without assistance from the Battalions.    The question of whether or  not  there is a  deficiency ofCivilian Labour in a port is a matter of  fact which  will bedecided by the Local Committee appointed for that port by thePort  and  Transit  Executive  Committee.  Upon  this  LocalCommittee there are       One representative of the Admiralty,      One representative of the War Office,      One representative of the Port Authority,      One representative of Labour.    Each Local Committee has  appointed  one  of its  number toact  as Chairman, and it has appointed its own Secretary.    In judging whether there is  a deficiency, no  hard-and-fastscale for either discharge or loading can be&apos; laid down; a rate
which  was deemed  satisfactory in times  of  peace cannot betaken as limiting that which is possible, and should be obtained,in time of war.   The Port and Transit Executive Committee have no controlover rates of pay or conditions of work, but if disputes anddifficulties arise on these points they must be dealt with withoutinterfering with, the flow of  traffic through the ports.  If theCivilian Labour in  a port is not prepared to  work, that must,from the National point of view, be treated as a deficiency.   The Local  Committee must  act  promptly when occasionarises.   It is neither necessary nor desirable to postpone obtain-ing help from the Battalions until the port is congested or  untilvessels are being held up for indefinite periods.  The blockingof the port and the resulting delays must be avoided.   It must be clearly recognised  that it is   only inability orfailure on the part of Civilian Labour to handle effectively andpromptly  the  traffic through the  port which will  justify thewithdrawal of the men of the Transport Workers&apos;  Battalionsfrom their military duties.

    Summary of the Conditions under which the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions may be employed.   Special Battalions of Transport Workers, largely drawn frommen who were employed in civil life -as dockers, have  beenformed, under  Army Council Instructions No.  498  of 1916,Nos. 713 of 1916, No. 1488 of 1916, No. 1760 of 1916, No. 1949of 1916, No. 2269 of 1916, No. 107 of 1917, No. 134 of 1917,No. 309 of 1917, and No. 373 of 1917, for duty at the  ports andon the railways and canals in the United Kingdom.   These Battalions are as follows:       The 12th (Transport Workers) Battalion, the Bedfordshire        Regiment; Head Quarters, Croydon.      The 13th (Transport Workers) Battalion, the Bedfordshire        Regiment; Head Quarters, Croydon.      The 16th (Transport Workers) Battalion, the Cameronians        (Scottish Rifles);  Head Quarters, Paisley.      The 17th (Transport Workers) Battalion, the Cameronians        (Scottish Rifles);  Head Quarters, Hamilton.      The 15th (Transport Workers)  Battalion, The Worcester-        shire Regiment; Head Quarters, Swindon.      The 16th (Transport Workers) Battalion, The Worcester-        shire Regiment; Head Quarters, Swindon.      The 15th (Transport Workers) Battalion, The Prince of        Wales&apos; Volunteers (South Lancashire Regiment); Head        Quarters,  Bebington, Cheshire.      The 16th (Transport Workers) Battalion, The Prince of        Wales&apos; Volunteers (South Lancashire Regiment) ; Head        Quarters,  Prescot, Lancashire.      The 16th (Transport Workers) Battalion, the York and        Lancaster Regiment; Head  Quarters,  Barnard Castle,        Durham.   All  ranks  are subject at all times  to military  law anddiscipline.   The ports for which the services  of the Battalions are nowavailable are named in the annexed list.  In each of- these portsa Local Committee has been set  up by the  Port and TransitExecutive Committee.   An employer requiring assistance from  the Battalions mustfirst apply to the  Local Committee of the port, who will decidewhether or not there is a deficiency in civilian labour.  If theLocal Committee  certify such a deficiency, then the  employermay lodge a written application, stating       (1) The number of men required.      (2) The class of work upon which they will be engaged.      (3) The  period for  which  the men will be  probably          employed.   The application, unless otherwise stated in the annexed list,is to be lodged by the employer with  the Port Authority for theport in which the men are to be employed.
    When engaged on work for civilian employers, the employers will pay for the services of the N.C.O.&apos;s and men of the Battalions the current civilian rates of pay, no charge to the employers being made in respect of Officers.    The Officer actually in charge of a party will pay the men, deducting Health Insurance, no payment of any  kind being made direct to the men by the civil employer.    The employer will be responsible in case of death or injury to the men, while employed on civil work,  within the limits laid down in the Workmens Compensation Act.    The employer must signify in his application his acceptance of  the  above  terms, and he must adhere to these conditions Avhilst the men are engaged on civil work.    Any complaint or difference  of opinion regarding rates  of civil pay, conditions  of work, or other matters connected with the civil employment, must be referred to the Officer in charge of the party.    No charge will be made against the civil  employer for cost of conveyance  of parties  to or from work.    An application should not be made for men if the employ- ment is for a period of less than  five days.    As the Battalions  have been formed solely  for reasons  of National urgency, and exist to supplement and not  to supplant civil labour, employers must inform themselves, before applying to the Local Committee, as to the availabilitjr or otherwise  of -civil labour.
