Admiralty,  to  the Sec.  War Cabinet;Sir,         I am  commanded  by My Lords  Commissioners of theAdmiralty to acquaint  you, for the information of the WarCabinet,  that  the  Imperial Munitions Board of Canada have, throughthe Ministry of Munitions, made enquiry of Their Lordships as tothe views of H.M.  Government  in regard to the protection of Labouremployed  iri shipbuilding in Canada.   2.    My Lords  have had the opportunity of seeingcorrespondence by  cable  between the  Imperial Munitions Board ofCanada  and the Ministry  of Munitions.   It appears that theImperial  Munitions Board, in  view of the urgent need for tonnageand the scarcity of  skilled labour,  has approached the Governmentof Canada to enquire whether  that Government would be prepared tosanction  some  form of  exemption from military service for workersengaged on shipbuilding  and allied work.   No such exemption hashitherto  been  asked  for  in Canada in regard to Munition workgenerally, and the Imperial Munition Board. is anxious to ascertainwhether in present circumstances H.M. Government consider that quickshipbuilding is of supreme importance,  and that men engaged on itshould  receive exemption from military service.   3.    My Lords  consider that the  relative importance ofshipbuilding and recruiting in Canada is not a matter on whichthey  can  express an  opinion to the Government of Canada withoutthe sanction of the  War  Cabinet.  In case,  however, the WarCabinet should decide  to communicate on the point with theCanadian  Government, My  Lords desire to express Their opinionthat  there should  be sufficient protection of the shipbuildingindustry  in Canada to  enable  the fullest possible use to bemade  of all plant  that i3 already erected or that can beerected within a reasonable period.I am,  Sir,    Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   W.GRAHAM GREEKS.
