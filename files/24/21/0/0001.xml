Fighting in the streets recommenced about noon yesterday.

The opposing side consisted of BOLSHEVIKS supported by a certain number of soldiers from disloyal regiments, a contingent from KRONSTADT, men of the old regime and German agents. The hospital registers shew that some 500 killed and wounded were registered in the LITENI district alone. Heavy rain continued from 8 last night and is still falling.  This - coupled with orders by General POLOVTZEV, commanding PETROGRAD, that people were to remain indoors and that the troops were to restore order - seems to have had the desired result. No shooting is to be heard at present.

Arms were taken from civilians seen carrying same in the streets.

To-days issue of the Conservative Newspaper "BIRSHEVIE VEDOMOSI" gives the following account of the disturbance here:- Yesterday morning the BOLSHEVIKS commenced propaganda in the working class quarter and at noon a meeting was held at the propaganda headquarters at which 4,000 KRONSTADT sailors were present, where at it was decided to compel the provisional government by force to arms to transfer all power to the Council of workmen and soldiers delegates notwithstanding the latter&apos;s complete condemnation of such action and refusal of the acceptation of power.

LENIN, TROTSKI and others toured the city addressing the regiments favourable to their movement, inciting repetition of the terrorist activity of Monday. Thereupon armoured cars arrived on the main street, shooting into the air. In the afternoon the BOLSHEVIKS proceeded to the DUNA, their object being to capture and remove KRONSTADT members of the Government supposed to be there. The Minister of Agriculture TCHERNOFF went to address a mob consisting of the Chief KRONSTADT seamen, when he was requested to make an immediate declaration that all land be transferred to the people, TCHERNOFF was surrounded and arrested at that moment TROTSKI appeared on the scene and addressed  the sailors:- "Revolutionaries of Russia, which of you is in favour of using force?" No answer.  TROTSKI then pompously declared "Comrade TCHERNOFF, you are free* whereupon TROTSKI was released.  All works were closed. In the afternoon there was considerable shooting on the NEVSKI and principal Streets, also a severe encounter between the COSSACKS on patrol and the Section named and workmen supporting the BOLSHEVIKS.  Many were killed and wounded. A Proclamation, issued by the Council of workmen soldiers and the peasants of All Russian delegates, requesting immediate cessation of armed demonstrations had no effect. Several Military units arrived from the surrounding district with the object of assisting the BOLSHEVIKS, although the absence of several supposed BOLSHEVIK units of the PETROGRAD garrison was noticeable. It is considered that the vast majority of the garrison and armoured cars support the Government.

(End of Newspaper summary).

This morning all bridges over NEVA were drawn up or barred and, in accordance with Government orders,  pedestrian and other traffic was almost completely suspended. There was no disturbance.
