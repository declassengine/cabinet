OPERATIONS.                          SECRET *        ^Prom:-   General Barter,  Jassi,  Roumania.To:-    C.I.G.S.   War Office.           26.7.17.                                        &apos; 3.30. p.m.No number.          Offensive Roumanian Army was conducted withgroat dash and success on July 24th/25th.  I visitedfirst German position after capturo and realisedexcellence of preparation for attack and efficiency ofartillery.          German resistance proved only moderate:reserves weak: up to date 46 guns and 1000 prisonerscaptured.          Offensive Roumanian 1st Army which wasintended for this morning abandoned suddenly yesterdayevening.  I was with the king when the order wasreceived.   He was much perturbed fearing separate peaceby Ruesianso          I reassured him, stating suspension was no doubtdue to withdrawal of Russian troops for Galicia.          Roumanian authorities are much depressed.          I am lunching today and tomorrow with King andPrime Minister and shall do my best to encourage them.          Russian authorities are confident, Commander 4thand 6th Armies gave me personal assurance that Germansuccess may be productive of good in strengthening thehands of  the provisional Government and in restoration ofdiscipline.          I am informed that enemy for Galician offensivehas withdrawn 17 Divisions from other fronts.          I venture to express opinion that immediatecongratulation on success and assurances from high quarterin England of our best intentions as to early supply ofmaterial would create very favourable effect.  In my ownview from my observation on field action any assistancewe can tender is not only well deserved,but would be ofadvantage  to common cause. I leave for Rutsian GeneralHeadquarters tomorrow.
