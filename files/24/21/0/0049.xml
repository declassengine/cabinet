G/g. 1548.    from.-  2.  A.  Petrograd.    To:-    B.M.I.                                      26th July 1917.    1266*     The death Penalty ha8 been Introduced In military law    hut from the  wording of  the proclamation it is designed more    for use at the  front than to restore discipline in depot units    in rear.              The dismissal  of lolovtsev is to bo regretted, the    reason  being  ostensibly  that Polovtser did not take strong    enough  measures at the beginning of the late disorders.  As    &apos;t    a matter of fact he had  no troops he could trust.              Keren sic i demands strong measures from his subordin-    ates but he himself yields at ones to political pressure from    the extremists.   He has told the district staff to issue a    proclamation  inv&amp;ting them to themselves bring in their arms.    Kornilov issued a similar proclamation 3 months ago with no    result.    Without difficulty the Staff has collected 1000    rifles  from one factory.    There are 20,000 rifles remaining.OOPY.(/ &quot;\
