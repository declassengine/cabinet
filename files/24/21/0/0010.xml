That, subject to the Admiralty being able to provide reasonable    protection, the Shipping Controller &quot;be requested  to arrange  for    an increase of tonnage allocated to coal shipments to Italy  in    September, partly by sending ships voyaging to India through the    Mediterranean instead of via the Cape, and partly by withdrawing    wheat ships from the. Transatlantic service.    It was understood that in this way the Shipping Controller could    increase the shipments by a minimum of 100,000 tons a month. &apos;4.
