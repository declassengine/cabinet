-HALL79/Londoh/65,War Cabinet.Provision of Anti-aircraft, guns.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for war.          With reference to War Cabinet 190 (16),  I circulate anote on the provision of anti-aircraft guns.         It will be remembered that the War Cabinet at theirmeeting of 30th December,  1916 (War Cabinet 23 (15)) approved therecommendation of Lord Curzon, Chairman of the Air Board,  &quot;Thatfor the present artillery anti-aircraft defence was of lessurgency than the arming of cur merchant ships.   They thereforerecommended that subject to the retention of a small reserve, aay15 or 20 guns, for the defence of vulnerable points of greatimportance, the whole of the future supplies of 3&quot; 20 cwt.  anti-aircraft guns amounting to 190 Bhould be handed uver to the  -Admiralty for arming merchant ships&quot;.          At that date we had 297 of these guns on order from theMinistry of Munitions, which they expected to give us at the rateof 26 per month.   Actually 130 of these guns have been producedthis year.   Of these 90 have gone to the Navy;  16 to homedefences and 24 1.0 Prance.          Th* Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief,  Home Defences, .has now pvt forward a demand for 190 3&quot; 20 cwt. guns in addition&quot;to the anti-aircraft equipments he already possesses.   These heconsiders necessary for an adequate defence of London againstair raids.          At the present time we have 232 3&quot; 20 owt. equipmentson order from the Ministry and the output of these guns and theirmountings, the latter at present the governing factor,  is  asfollows                                    Guns.   Mountings.AugustSeptemberOctoberNovember 41212121699and it 1b unlikely that the output  can be  expedited beforeJanuary next.          Of the other modern anti-aircraft  equipment, namelythe 13-pdr.  9 cwt. we have 126 on order and  we  expect to receivefrom the MinistryAugust
             August      15             September    9             October      8             November    15but of these five a month are required for reserve in thedifferent theatres..          It is impossible to expedite the output of A,A. gunsfrom the Ministry except at the expense of 60 pdrs.  and  18 pdrsand in the opinion of the M.0.0,  both of these natures are moreurgently required than A,A. Guns.          We have just handed, over to the lfavy 60 -  77 cm.(German Field) guns for arming.merchant ships.          It is possible,  therefore,  that m these circvm-stances the War Cabinet may consider  it desirable to revise theallocation of the 3&quot; 20 cwt.  guns between the Navy and the  Army.
