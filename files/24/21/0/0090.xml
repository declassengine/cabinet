S   C ft g EtG.T.1589                      wAR  CABINBT,    Memorandum prepared  fry the admiralty Haval Stgjt    &apos; In accordance with  hair ft?binot&quot;1^5,  Minute 8*     In compliance with the direction of the *.iar Cabinet, thequestion of organising convoys in conjunction tfith our ownor otherwise so as to afford in future 68 much protection aspossible to Allied and lieutral snipping nee been considered.     The principle on which the convoy system is being organisedprovides for the inclusion of all Allied shipping without reatric-tions of any kind, and in the case of Neutrals for the inclusion,if willing, of ell vessels carrying cargoes for the UnitedKingdom or Allied Pov?ers.     The convoy system is as yet far from complete, but so faras it is established it includes tho regular convoy cf a largenumber of Neutral ships.     The utain routes on yjhich Neutral shipping is employedare;-     (1)  In the Kortb Sea,     (2)  The Preach Coal Trade,     (3)  Italian Cc&amp;l Trade end tho ore trade from the           AfeCiterranean and Spanish Atlantic Ports,     (4)  Atlantic Trade     In the -     (X)  lierth Sea two re^lar oenvoys ere established, onefor the Duion tirade, and tho other for the Scandinavian Tradi.In the cess of the latter the ships arc under continual escortfrom the time cf leaving ii itish ports until they reachNorwegian Territorial V/aters and vice versa.     ( )  ffrenoh Coal Trade. The French Oo^l Trade convoy isfully organised, three separate convoys leaving BritishChannel ports daily.  ...?pro:;iraately 60;[. of the vessels in thistrade belong tc either allied or Ueutral countries.     The principle on which this system is worked is thatBritish escorting vessels accompany the oonvoy across theChannel to the French Coast, where they are relieved byFrench patrol Vessels, which escort them tc their ports cfdestination.     The French patrol forces have so far been insufficientte provide effective protection, but thoy are now in processof boin^ roinforood by patrol vessels from America,  snd it Isanticipated that ths losses experienced on the  est Coast efPrance will in future he considerably reduoed.
        (3) Mediterranean..._Italian and Spanish Trade, the second of whaTH hoped will be a regular system of Convoy sailings from Gibraltar is now on its way to the United kingdom.  It include-; six -Jljed or Central Vessels.  tfeutral vessels passing through Gibraltar are invited to join this convoy, and it will include Ore  hips from Euelva, some of which are IJeutrals.        (4) Atlantic Trade.  Tho number of neutral ships sailing from American PoFEs with cargoes for the United Kingdom or Allies Nations is small, and the organisation does not yet provide for their inclusion generally in the convoy system,   -hen this system was instituted the question was carefully considered snd it was decided that, in view of the risks of information imperilling the safety of the convoy leaking out and reaching the enemy, only under special cir- cumstances and subject to approval from the Admiralty were they to be Included in the Convoy.  The question of Spanish shipping requires special mention.  On leaving ports on the Uorth and h:est of Spain, ships are advised to follow tho ooast in Spanish Territorial waters, putting into St. Jean de Luc to await escort tc iSrest.  As It is impossible to afford direct protection in Spanish Territorial haters, it is strongly urged that representations be made to the Spanish Government in regard to the advisability of escorting Spanish and other $eutral Vessels from ilorth Spanish Ports by men-of-war to St.  Jean de Luz,   The route to be followed should be inside territorial waters.  There are twelve Srazilian Shipsnow in England which are about to assemble at Gilford Haven andwill be escorted clear of submarine uanger zone.  This will alsoconstitute a trial of the first outward bound Mercantile convoy.Omitting the Mediterranean,  for which a convoy organisation isnow under consideration, it will be seen that a great measureof protection is now being given to allied and Heutral Shipping,and this will increase as the convoy system exoands.Admiralty $aval Staff,     29tb July, 1917.
