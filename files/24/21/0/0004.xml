I1to  (1CAB/,  ISiTculated by the Secretary of State for India.17SECRET.War Cabinet.   The Minister of Shipping was informed on 20th June that the Governmentof India  required, as an absolutely  essential supply, and mainly for theneeds of overseas forces, 7,955 transport mules from the Argentine  to beshipped at the rate of 2,000  a month from  September  onwards.   Up to thepresent date,  transport  for  only  1,150 mules  has been  arranged.   TheGovernment of India have done their  utmost to reduce transport of mulesfrom the Argentine by arranging to take 4,000 mules from  North China.   On 11th July this Office  was informed that the question of  this transportwas regarded as part of the  total animal transport requirements of the WarOffice,  the provision of  which was postponed for  further  considerationpending the report of the War Policy  Committee.   I note, however,  from the Minutes  (No. 17) of  the meeting of the  WarCabinet on 16th July, that as regards the transport of horses from Australia,the Cabinet have decided that it is unnecessary to settle this matter for theperiod  of two or three months.   It is hoped that this decision does  not  involve a similar  postponement ofthe attempt  to provide  transport for the mules.  As  will  be seen from theGovernment of India&apos;s telegram of 15th June (copy enclosed)  it is essentialthat they should be provided, and  very important  that their supply shouldbe arranged for from September onwards.  Pending  definite  arrangementsfor transport, little progress can, however, be made for their purchase.   I am anxious, therefore, to know that an attempt will be made to providethis transport  as soon as possible.   India Office,                                              E.  S.
