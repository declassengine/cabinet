A  number of golf links in the Manchester district
 have been carefully inspected  by a special Sub-Committee, who recommended that  they should be  chiefly used for grazing^ as,.owing to the fact that they are mostly situated in a rivervalley, they do not consider them suitable for ploughing.  Onthe Blackley links in this district, the club have, with thelabour and at the expense of the members, fenced off all thegreens, and are grazing 50 head of milking stock belonging toa neighbouring farmer who has thus been enabled to plough upa corresponding amount of pasture land.  On the NorthManchester course the club have fenced off 18 acres of land,and have let if for the grazing of stock.Norfolki  The owner of the Shadwell estate (Mr. Musher) isreported to have broken up 1,100 acres in Norfolk, and proposesto break up another 1,000 acres for the 1918 harvest; for thispurpose he has purchased six tractors.Suffolk, East.

Inspector.  In Cheshire, in addition to the schemes alreadyin hand, the Committee are taking action under the Drainage ofLands Order with regard to water-courses on Coppenhall Mossand at Calveley.  The Flintshire Agricultural ExecutiveCommittee are commencing work under the Orders upon the RhylCut, and have prepared a scheme for work at Prestatyn.  TheNorfolk committee are taking further action with regard to theregulating of sluices and the clearing of obstructions on theLittle Ouse, and are arranging for a conference of owners witha view to action on the River Tud, as well as on the landfronting the Wash between Sandringham and Hunstanton.  TheStaffordshire and Derbyshire Committees are arranging for jointaction with regard to the flooding of the Trent about Tutbury.            Cultivation of Lands^ Order 1917. (No. 2.)          Particulars received from 1,048 Boroughs or UrbanDistrict Councils show that 193,061 applications have been madefor plots, and. 174,335 plots, containing a total area of 12,897acres, have been provided under the Order.  An amended reportfrom Swindon shows that about 3,000 permanent allotments werepreviously included in the return of war plots:  and thereduction of the figures previously reported is thus accountedfor.          Enquiry has been made by the District Commissioner asto the steps taken by South Wales  Collieries with regard to foodproduction.  Thirty-three collieries state that no land has beenput into cultivation, the reasons  assigned being that land inthe vicinity is not available,  or  is inaccessible, wet, orunsuitable for cultivation, or, in some cases, the miners havegardens attached to their houses and do not desire field-garden^.In the cases of 76 other collieries, 5,531 allotments have beenprovided, containing a total area  of 352 acres,  andpreparations are being made for allotting a further area of 105                             -  3 -
acres for next season^ cultivation.  These collieries alsoare growing oats on 121 acres more than in the previous year.As these particulars relate to only about one half of the totalnumber of large collieries in South Wales, they do not representthe total increased food production on colliery land.                     HORTICULTURAL SECTION.Fruit Bottling.  The number of demonstrations in fruit bottlingand drying given during the week by Travelling Instructors was264, making the total number of deivionstrations given up to thepresent 954.

A pamphlet on the Canning of Fruit andVegetables has also been published.          The number of jars for which orders were receivedduring the week v/as 107,688, bringing the total up to 1,540,092.The number of jars despatched during the week was 160,944,making a total of 569, 688.          Owing to the difficulties experienced in obtainingdeliveries from the manufacturers, It has been necessary toannounce that orders could riot be accepted by the Departmentafter July 31st. The number of jars despatched during the past7/eek, though higher than in any previous week, is some 140,000below the estimate provided for the Department by the Ministryof Munitions. The Ministry has, however, recently expressed theconfident hope that all the orders will be executed by the endof August.Potato Spraying.

About 300 reports have been received Inresponse to the enquiry on the results of breaking up grass in1916-17.   The reports are now being summarised and will be re-ferred to more fully later, but it may be noted that the successesare about three times as numerous as the failures;  the latterbeing attributed mainly to wireworm, but sometimes to indifferentcultivation.   Officers of the Department have arranged te inspectsome of the best and worst examples.Cost of Milk production.   A memorandum on Cost of Production andthe Price of Milk, based on ah extensive enquiry, has been com-                               ipiled for submission te the Departmental Committee on theProduction and Distribution of Milk.Plant Diseases.

There v/ere over1,000 entries,  and the general standard of v/ork shov/n by thecompetitors was high.   Demonstrations were held in milking,horse management, hoeing, hedging and ditching,  manure cartingand spreading,  etc.          Recent reports indicate that the women volunteering noware of a better type than those who came forward a few months ago,but unfortunately considerable difficulty Is  being experienced insome parts of the country at present in finding  work for  womeneven after they have passed through the Training Centres.    Everyeffort is being made by the Department to break  down this  prejudiceand to encourage the employment of  women.

Moguls.   The total number ofTractors at the Departments disposal is therefore 797, of which622 have been obtained from America, the remaining 175 having beenpurchased in this country.   A large consignment of &quot;Titan&quot; tractorsis expected almost immediately.Harness.   CIO sets of harness with 100 additional collars havebeen supplied to Executive Committees.   A further 20 sets havefteen purchased by Committees locally, and there remain Q5 sets instock.          It is expected that 500 - S00 further sets of harnesswill be obtained from the Army Depot at Woolwich.   In view of thedifficulty of securing collars, to which reference was made in.last week&apos;s report, it has been decided that any suitable collarsavailable in towns shall be requisitioned, and an order for thispurpose will be Issued by the Army Council under the Defence ofthe Realm Regulations.   It is also proposed to purchase inAmerica collars to the number unobtainable in this country.                        SUPPLIES.Supplies Sub-Committees.   A circular explaining the functions ofSupplies Sub-Committees etc. was issued on July 26th,  and inspectorsare now visiting all counties with a view to ensuring a closertouch between the Sub-Committees and the Department, and in orderto hasten the recognition of &quot;Approved Agents&quot;.Superphosphates.    Pending the decision of the Treasury as to agrant in aid of the cost of transport from works to farmers&apos;stations nothing final can be  done in regard to fixing the pricesto the farmer either of superphosphate or of compound  manurescontaining it.
Basic Slag. The notice in regard.to supplies and prices of basicslag has now been issued.   Of the coming season1 s output ofabout 400,000 tons, all but about 30,000 has been sold for forwarddelivery.   The makers of the 30,000 tons have been instructed tomake no further contracts without the permission of the Department,It is hoped that from this source and from the new make of lowgrade slag which the Ministry of Munitions is organising, enoughwill be available to meet any acute shortages.Binder-Twine.  &apos;The need for ensuring ample supplies for the 1918harvest is being pressed upon the Agricultural Machinery Branch ofthe Ministry of Munitions, and it Is hoped that a definiteunderstanding will shortly be reached.Fencing Wire.  The Agricultural Machinery Branch of the Ministryof Munitions state that priority for fencing wire and netting i3most difficult to secure, but they have promised assistance inproviding for very urgent requirements.Seed Wheat..  Up to the present, orders for 1,012 quarters of seedwheat pf the 1916 crop have been received from Supplies Committees,          The inspection and purchase of crops of the selectedvarieties of wheat of the 1917 crop are proceeding satisfactorily.The latest reports received show that contracts have been made withgrowers for a total of 4,050 acres.Seeds other than Cereals, Supplementary returns of the acreage ofroot seeds for which contracts have been placed have been receivedfrom the leading Seed firms.   These returns indicate that up tothe present the following percentages of the normal areas undercontract have been arranged for:-          Swede 90,2.    Turnip 100.1.    Mangel 83,9.It is understood, however, that a number of farmers who are in thehabit of growing seeds under contract for the Seed Houses are thisyear growing as a speculation for themselves, and the AdvisoryCommittee are of opinion that the acreage grown under these
circumstances will, together with that grown by contract, provld;.an adequate supply of seed for sowing and for export in 1918,          The position will be watched very closely and if in thecourse of the next month satisfactory evidence is not forthcomingto show that an ample supply of root seeds is being grown, theissue of an Order prohibiting the ploughing up of any plant bedsuntil the 1st l-arch,  1918 will be considered.Soed Potatoes.  In view of the restricted aoreage under &quot;KingGeorge V&quot; and &quot;Great Scot&quot; in Scotland, the Kinistry of Pood hasbeen invited to  Increase the scope of the proposed Order relatingto immune varieties tc be reserved for seed*so as to include &quot;oncegrown&quot; seed and  additional resistant varieties.                           I am,                                Sir,                                    Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt,Hon,Rowland E.Prothero, H.P.
