The fact that during the week fiity-six ships, corresponding to &apos;4 ofthe average weekly entries from oversea, have arrived safely under ocean convoy,indicates that the risk to unconvoyed ships is increasing ;  for other things being equal,the large  number  of safe  arrivals under  convoy would have led  to  a  substantialreduction in the sinkings.  The fact that it has  not  done so may be partly due to thetransition  from the patrol to the  convoy  system, with the consequent withdrawal ofdestroyers, &amp;c, from the patrol-led routes.    The losses were  distributed  as follows : Channel, South and West  of Ireland,and Bay of  Biscay,  4 each;  North and West  of Scotland and North  Sea, 2 each ;Spanish coast and Mediterranean, 1 each.    At least eighteen to twenty  large boats are  known to have been  out  daring theweek, and  of these ten have been operating to the west of the British Lsles.    On the  26th July the old cruiser &quot;Ariadne,&quot; of 11,000 tons displacement, whichhad been fitted as a minelayer, was torpedoed and sunk off Beachy Head.    A German submarine entered the Spanish port of Corunna on the 29th July.  TheSpanish Government have interned it in accordance with the Boyal Decree issued  after&quot; U.C. 52&apos;s &quot; departure from Cadiz.    Nineteen engagements have  been reported with enemy submarines  during theweek.   One of these, which grounded near  Calais, is known, and  four  others arebelieved to have been destroyed.    The following table shows the number of ships convoyed on different routes up tothe 28th July with, the losses from enemy action.  Although the French [coal  trade isincluded, the term &quot; controlled sailing &quot; expresses its nature better than &quot; Convoy &quot;Convoy.	Date of Commence-ment.	Number of Ships Convoyed.

Its success appears to be  primarily due to aconcentration of force close to the enemy&apos;s objective, ready to take  the  offensive  themoment a  submarine is  sighted, and to the facility with which  the convoy can bediverted from  dangerous areas.  It has, however, been  proved time after time thatdestroyers do not secure immunity for the ships they are escorting, and  therefore acertain number of losses must be expected from convoys sooner or later.  The enemymay also alter his methods in order to meet  the  convoy system.  For example, attackby battle-cruisers, co-operating with large submarines, acting as scouts and  screeningforce, may be developed on the Atlantic trade routes.

                                Minor Operations.    During the week, machines of the Royal Naval Air Service have carried out severalraids from Dunkirk on enemy aerodromes and other places of military importance.    Two German merchant-ships have been sunk off the Texel by our submarines.Ships drawing more than 18 feet have to  keep outside  territorial waters for 5 milesof their journey up the coast  on account of the shoal water in this locality, so that ifenemy ships or  neutral  ships  carrying enemy goods  are  intercepted off the Texel,they have either to surrender or run ashore outside territorial waters.   In  the  lattereventuality they  can be destroyed without infringing Dutch neutrality.   A draught of18 feet and  a distance of 5 miles are  based on the assumption that it is high waterand that ships can just skirt the shoals, but in practice these limitations really apply toall seagoing steamers.   During daylight hours it is just possible that ships drawingless than  17 feet may  at high water  pass inside territorial waters by  entering theTexel through the southern channel  and leaving by the northern, or vice versa.    A flotilla of light cruisers and destroyers from the  Grand  Fleet recently carriedout an unsuccessful  search in the North Sea for enemy mine-sweepers.    During the  week we have  laid  mines in the North Sea and off  the Belgian coastand deep mines in the English Channel.                       SUMMARY OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.                      Movements of German Merchant Ships.    To and from Norwegian ports : Arrived, 8.  Sailed, 4.    To and from Rotterdam :  Arrived, nil.  Sailed, 1.    Information from a reliable source states that coal for twenty German ships whichwere due to arrive at  Rotterdam has been stopped.  No German ships have arrived atRotterdam  since the 26th June, so, for. the time being, the trade seems to  havestopped.    From the 16th June to 13th July the total amount of iron ore exported to Germanyfrom Oxelosund was 50,352 tons.  No coal arrived from Germany during the periodthe 16th-30tk June, hut 3,481  tons arrived during week ending the 13th July.    The following has been received from the British Minister at Stockholm :         &quot; M. Axel Johnson tells me that iron ore exports from  Sweden to  Germany    are greatly in excess of pre-war exports, and, if they are to he reduced, some steps    should be taken at once while German ships are still able to carry ore from Lulea.    (Lulea becomes icebound probably in October.) &quot;                                    Russia.    Baltic. Captain  Rasvozoff  has  been promoted to the position of Commander-in-Chief, Baltic Fleet, vice Admiral Verderevsky, who has been arrested for promulgatinga secret Government  order.  It  is feared that the Germans  have secured plans ofRussian minefields in the  Baltic.   The minefields  are  now  being  strengthened.According to latest reports  the situation  in the  Baltic fleet is  better.  Russian troopshave been sent to Finland with the double object of dealing with the internal situationand of guarding against a possible German invasion, which is feared.    Black Sea. There is no news of any operation in  the Black Sea.   The NikolaefShipbuilding  and  Engineering  Works,  an  important firm at  Nikolaef for  theconstruction  and refits of  ships  of  the  Russian navy, and which has  also supplieda &quot;large amount of munitions, has closed down.   The hands  have left to work  on theharvest.  In  January L916 this  firm  employed  14,500 hands, of which 3,000 weremaking munitions.                                    Sweden.    It is reported on excellent  authority that the Germans have offered Sweden  cerealsand mineral oils in exchange, it is presumed, for meat and fats.  This may  affect  ourhold on Sweden as regards restriction of imported foodstuffs to  that country.
                                   Denmark    It is reported that heavy guns have been transferred from a coast defence batterynorth of Copenhagen to new emplacements south of the city covering Kjoge Bay.    The Danish Government has refused under any circumstances to consider negotia-tions for the purchase by Germany.of the island of Faeno, in the Little Belt.                                   Norway.    i        t    The Norwegian Government contemplates in the near future changing their claimto a limit of 4 miles of territorial waters to a claim to a limit of 3 miles.  This is to befor the period of the war only.    A strike of clock labourers against German shipping as a protest for the sinking ofthe  Norwegian steamship &quot; Kong  Haakon &quot; has taken  place  at  Stavanger  andHaugesund.  This is considered  significant of public feeling, but it is not likely to haveany serious effect on export to Germany.MONTHLY Return of German Shipbuilding, August 1, 1917.Type.	Building.
