SECRET.  -STftTSoo    WjL J__OA BIO  T.T^0^AS^^gIPBTJI3&quot;PIgg PROGRAMS.  Interim Report  by. o?a :CuT&amp;on.     This Gomraittee was  appointed by a decision of the  rar Cabinet(.w.C. 160. Minute 19)  to examine into the steps th&amp;t should betaken as regards tho supply both of steel and labour, and carryinto effeot the programme of increased merchant shipbuilding upto a total of 3,100,000  tons per annum,  that was submitted to theVar Cabinet by Sir S.  S-eddes and approved in prinoiple by them.The Committee has held several sittings at whioh the representativesof the various Departments concerned attended and stated their case.In order that tho War  Cabinet may be seized c  the situation andmay give the requisite authority for carrying out their instructions,on points where there  is not complete agreement between the Depart-ments, I have decided  to submit this interim -Report to the war Cabinetvihose early decision is  solicited.                            I. MATERIAL.     The  present  outputgfof finished  steel,  exclusive  of Shell Dis-oard Quality is:-                 Per week about        ...    140,140  tons.The main  purposes for which  this  supply is  used are:-                                                   Tons  per  week.For making Shell and Shell Parts for British       32,455 &quot;     &quot;     n    &quot;    &quot;     *&apos;    &quot;  Allies        10,955    !?ar Office,  including Railways, &quot;Tam:s&quot;,        Trench Warfare,  I.V.T,. Mechanical        Transport and General Purposes             12,90$    Admiralty (including Auxiliary Craft)           14,032    Mercantile Marine   ...   .,.                   14,357    Construction Work   ...   ...                    4j035
Aircraft ... ... 1,016

Railway Maintenanee ... ... 2,767

Rheela and Tyres ... ... 962

Locomotives ... ... 634

Export (other than shell Steel) 8,130.

The present supply of steel to merchant ship-building is sufficient to afford about 13,000 tons per week for the  hulls of vessels and would give, roughly speaking, an output of  ... ... ... 1,350,0OO tons gross of shipping per annum.

An increase of 5,000 tons of ships&apos; plates and 2,500 tons of  sections per week would augment the output to ... ... ... 2,060,000 tons gross. Owing, however, to the limited plate-rolling capacity in this country, there are involved in getting even this restricted increase in shipbuilding certain readjustments, including the cutting down, to some extent, of the supply of shell steel, both to ourselves and to France.

A further increase of 1,500 tons of ships&apos; plates per week can be obtained by rolling smaller and thicker plates in the light mills which at present roll thin sheats. This would bring the output of shipping up to .... ... 2,200,000 tons gross per annum.

Certain extensions of steal work are new in progress, but they will yield no result before the end of the year, nor their full increase before July 1918. These will go a considerable way in helping to reach an output of 3 million tons gross of shipping? In the meantime until the adjustments suggested above have had full effect, 1,000 ton per weak ? be released for shipbuilding by a temporary reduction of our steal export to France and Italy, and by cutting down slightly the supply of plates to other Government services, but not so as to affect in any way the supply for guns, Aircraft, Locomotives or Agriculture. Accordingly, in view of the urgent neces-


ity of tho caso I oropose that tho following stops he taken:-(1)   That  the manufacture  of  Shell Steel  for  the  French     Government by British Firms  and  the  manufacture of     British Shell be  diminished  so far as  is necessary     to obtain the 5,000 tons of  stoel required to foed     the plate mills to  their full capacity.(2)   That  the cutting  down of the  manufacture of  Shell     Stool for France  in this country should  as far as     possible bo compensated  by the supply  of tonnage     to carry French Shell Stool  from the United  States     of America to France,  the Shipping Controller being     instructji in this  sense.(3)   That,  in any caso of  shortage of steel at works     engaged in making shell  steol as well  as shipsT     pistes and sections,  the manufacture of  the  plates     and sections should have priority.(4)   That,  where the lighter  plate-mills  can  roll plates     capable of being  used for shipbuilding purposes, this     should be done in preference to  rolling  thin sheets.(5)   That,  during the next six weeks,  the other Bepart-     ments  of tho Government  should have  their require-     r:ients  of plates over  l/4&quot; out down and that  the     supplies of steel plates to  France and Italy should,.     for the same period,  be  suspended, with  the  effeot     of releasing 1,000  tons  of plates per  week for     shipbuilding.(6)   Priority should be  given to  tho  extension of     existing plate mills  and to  such new mills as     are in contemplation.       Uhen  the Minister of Munitions has had on opportunity ofsurvoying  the whole situation and of preparing further proposals,the situation oan again be reviewed.  In the meantime, it ishoped that the  carrying out of those recomraendat-iona will notcauao any  insuperable difficulty to the services affected.                         II.  LABOUR.      To  produce the amount of tonnage above referred to, it plain that  a  considerable amount of extra labour will bequired.   For this purpose immediate stepa are necessary:-   (1)  The  firet step that I would recommend is that all        recruitment or withdrawal of labour from the ship-        yards  for the Army should cease.  At the present        moment all men who joined Munitions after March 29th        1917,  and art not in the schedule of Protected        Occupations, are being recruited
 (2)  If full advantage is to be taken of the rolling     capacity of this country it is necessary that     skilled steel and blast furnace workers should     be released from tho Array,  A list has been     drawn up by the Ministry of Munitions of 823     of ^hesc, and I recommend their immediate releaso     which the Secretary of State for vvar has indicated     his willingness to consider. (3)  Tho Admiralty has expressed the opinion that unless     shipbuilding be made a fully protected industry the     requisite number of men will not be forthcoming.     The Secretary of State for war will explain his     views to tho War Cabinet on this subject. (4)  All marine engineers anil-fitters who are at present     employed by the Ministry of Munitions should.be     released and transferred to tho Admiralty, otherwise     serious delay will take place re the provision of     marine engines for merchant ships. (5)  Shipyard..workers in tho Army should be released in     order to provide a nucleus ol skilled^JLabour for new     yards, (6)  The 7r:ar Office has promised to help with rogard     to the loan of prisoners of war. (7)  The Minister of Labour undertook to make a special     effort to obtain as many builders as possible for     the new shipyards,  and will endeavcrur to secure     5,000 men by this process.                      \(8)  when this  offort has been made recourse may be had     to tho Director General or National Service who has     expressed  his willingness  to help.(Initialled)    C.3rd August,  1917.
