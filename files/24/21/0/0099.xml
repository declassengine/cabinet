la I-BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES,Report for week ended 1st August, 1917.                           Meat for the Army.          A joint letter has been addressed to Lord Rhondda by Mr.prothero,  General Cowans and Sir Thomas Robinson with a view toarriving at a decision as to whether the BOard of Agricultureorganisation for purchasing 250,000 beef oattle for Armyconsumption, in accordance w$th ihe dOoision of the War Cabinet of19th March, shall be merged in a larger undertaking for the purchase&quot;by the Ministry of Food of beef for civil consumption.                        Tfoo Hon Oron of 1917.          Mr, Bonar Law has now approved the Board!s scheme bywhich the 1917 crop of hops will be taken over by a Commiistee ofManagement acting under the Board of Agriculture.   The details arenot fully settled yet, but the main feature&apos; of the scheme is thatihQ Managing Committee will be in a position to purohase fromgrowers all the  hops picked this year, and to pay immediately aprice designed to cover the oost of production.   The grower willhave to wait for the balance of the price, i.e. his profit, untilthe hops oan be realieed and the expenses of management paid off.Another important feature of the scheme is that no grower will beallowed to pick more than 80^ of his 1914 uoreage, as laid down bythe Hop Order of 19th May,   The Board will now proceed to appointthe Committee of Management, which will include representatives ofthe hop growers and other trade interests.                            Potatoes.,          The number of new oases of Wart Disease reported sincethe last report is 157 but this represents only a small part of thenumber under investigation.   The great majority of the cases areported are in Glamorgan and Staffordshire.          Arrangements are being made  with the Food ProductionDepartment for securing a supply of seed potatoes for next season,and a new Order is being prepared for  dealing with the situationIn South Wales.                           Statistics.          About half the agricultural returns have now beentabulated.   Some calculations  based on 40 per cent,, of the returnsindicate that the area under wheat in England and  Wales this yearwill probably prove to be only very slightly leas than in 1916;that under barley perhaps 125,000 acres more, under oats 140-150,000acres more, and that under potatoes 75,000 acres more than in 1916,The hay area may prove 100,000 acres leas (the reduction being mainlyin clover hay), while the permanent grass may be 200,000 acres lesst*ian in 1916.          Oowa and heifers in milk apparently decrease by some40,000, but this is more than counterbalanced by an increase ofnearly 60,000 in cows and heifers in calf, so that there ia little
  change  in  the  total dairy herd.   Other  oattle  over Z years  show a  small inorease, but yearlings and calves seem to be slightly less,  8aeep will shew a decline,  as there  are  $ million  fewer  lambs,  owing  to a bad lambing aeaeon.    Pigs will probably be nearly    million  lees.            Investigations into changes  in the number of live  stock  between the beginning  of June and beginning of  July shew practically  no change  in the dairy herds or total  number of oattle.            Prices of cattle, sheep and  pigs this week at  the  principal  markets shew a fall.                           Fisheries  Pitlaion.                        General Administrative fork.            The  Food Controller, at the  request of the Board,  has made  an Order empowering the Board to authorise the  use  in Tidal  and  Territorial Waters for the  purpose of  taking sea fish by methods  or appliances  of fishing and the taking or possession of  sea fish  which would otherwise  be unlawful.   The main purpose of the  Order is to enable the Board to over-ride existing local Byelaws  which restrict fishing operations;   it will also enable  the  Board  tc authorise the sale  during the olose season of Rainbow Trout  and  Portuguese Oysters (inported and relaid), both  of  which  are  cheap  and good articles of food.            Information  with  regard to fishing harbours round  the  coast,  and places where harbour or landing facilities could  be  afforded to fishing boats is being obtained through the  medium  of  Distrlot Inspectors,                             Permits to  Fish.            In addition  to the work on permits for fishing vessels,  the first  permits have been issued by  the Board under a  scheme  recently arranged by the Fish Food Committee and the Board1 a  Inspectors, for developing  amateur fishing under the necessary  control.            A record of  the movements  of the larger  steam  trawlers,  liners, and driftetfs into and out of port, is kept up from reports  received daily from the chief fishing  ports, and a statement is  sent every Friday to the Admiralty showing the  number of vessels  at sea  on  the  preeeding day and the  grounds on  which they were  working,            A statement  of the number  of fishing  boati laid up on the  last day of the month  of July, with  the  cause in each oase,  has  been prepared  and sent to the Admiralty,            Reports have been received,  and forwarded to the  Admiralty, from skippers of fishing  vessels of  a submarine sighted  and of  the local action taken.                      Fishermen1a Registration and Reeruiting.ffiahermeri and fiaval Service,   A list  of 55 men suggested  as  substitutes for others who  proved unavailable for Naval  Service has  been sent  to the Admiralty, as has also  the greater part of  the list  of men  constituting Call IX for Service.  When completed this  Call  will probably  number about  450 men,    A  request for a selection of  a like  number  to be included in Call X.  has been received.   Very -  numerous applications  from  fishermen for deferment of Hayal  8ervice  have been  considered,
vjHhgrmfln, Flah Trade and Military Service.  The Assistant Secretary  received a deputation of the National Fish, Poultry, Game, and  Rabbit Trades Association on the subject of the position of the fish  trade under the Military Service Acts.   It is hoped that it will  prove possible by co-operatim with this Association to support  the retention in civil life of the men necessary for the distribution  of fish, while enabling the Tribunals to distinguish between these  men and others who should be released for the Army.                 Committee on loans for motor fishing boats.           As a direct result of the Committee!s activities 27 motor  boats are now in commission and fishing regularly.   A further 5  vessels will, it is hoped, be running their trials this week and  other installations to the number of 25 are progressing steadily.           Engines are now on order for the 8 gunned fishing vessels  in which   the Committee has undertaken to instal motors.   Two of  the vessels are already at the shipyard, and the progress reported  is very satisfactory.   Another two vessels a2e to be put on the  slips next week, and will proceed at once.           It may be of interest to note that one of the motor bouts  supplied to a fisherman by the Committee landed over  500 worth of  fish   in a fortnight.                          Fish Food Committee.           Active arrangements are in hand for dealing with the  autumn sprat fishing, by distribution to communal kitchens and other  institutions and by setting up canning factories.           A scheme is being considered for building tanks at  suitable places on the coast for purifying mussels,fish.Endeavour is being made to reduce the retail price of             Fresh Water Fish Committee.          The Interim Report  as finally  settled  has been signed andsubmitted to the Board.          Further work has been done  in  connection with the  preparationof a leaflet dealing with the capture and use  of eels0          The material for a  leaflet  dealing with the preparation  andcooking of freshwater fish has been completed  and placed in  theprinters1 hands.          The  normal work  of  the Board proceeds on lines previouslyindicated,I......* *    ^     3rd August, 1917.
