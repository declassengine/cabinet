       RECRUITING IK ENGLAND.  SCOTLAND AND T-ALES*                        19 17,                 THEORY  OP  RECRUITING-.       There la no more Important question at tho presenttime than that of Man-Power.   There is no question whiohhas been le38 understood.  It has cortainly been mishandled.       The reason for thic mishandling is not far to seek.The theory whioh should guide the yithdrawal of man, formilitary purposes from civil life has never boon accuratelypresented to the public  Proposals to take all young menfrom civil life and turn them into soldiers have frequentlybeen put forward.  These appear to bo based either upona theory that in war the personnel of the Army in the fieldalono matters and that the civil activities of the nationwhich support the Army can bo Ignorod, or upon a theory thatthe value of a man in civil lifo is a function ef his age.The Military Service Acts and the &quot;Dorby Scheme&quot; andconsequently the administrative machine for recruiting areall based on some such theory.  In practice an intricatesystem of occupational exemptions has been grafted on tothem.       Howevor suited so simple a theory may have been inthe Napoleonic Era and earlier it is un3uited to the QOmpli-catod highly industrialised western nations of to-day, andalso bears no relation to the nature of presont day fightingwith its absolute dependence on munitions and machines ofall sorts.       &apos;.7e have tried it and it has never worked.  Further ithas cost the country several millions of quite unprofitablyapent money.  France and Germany have tried it and have had teadopt a oumbrous procedure of returning soldiers to the workshops                                                           in/
 in an  effort to undo the fundamental error.         There can be little doubt that in the complicated highly-industrialised modern state all recruitment should proceed upon a basis of occupation conditioned by age and physical fitness.   This may be termed the &quot;Occupation- Group  Theory&quot; of recruitment.         As only high--industrialised states can produce an  adequate supply of the engines of war, recruitment on the Occupation-Group basis appears likely to supersede all other methods.         Precisely to understand what is meant by the &quot;Occupation-Group&quot; Theory of Recruiting It is convenient to take a hypothetical case.   &quot;S&quot; is an industrialised state.   Its male inhabitants are engaged in one or other of four groups  of industries.   Gropp A comprises internal luxury trades;   Group B.,  export luxury trades;  Group C. trades useful and in some  parts essential;  Group D.  trades almost wholly essential to the life of the state in peace andwar.         The Groups might  then be drawn on as follows for drafts of men for military purposes:1st draft.  Group                                   Age^       A.

It is put forward to illustrate the principle,nothing more.   It is necessary to examine briefly somethinglens artificial.         The essential characteristic of the England ofto-day is the existence of vast agglomerations t&apos;of human beings in discrete areas, e.g., The West Riding ofYorkshire.   In these agglomerations there are great citiesforming nodes or nuclei.   The mark of an agglomeration is thatwithin its own boundaries it can neither grow its own food norprovide sufficient water catchment for its needs.         The existence of such agglomerations hypothesizestherefore the existence elsewhere of food producing and watercatchment areas, probably also a fuel producing area,and the existence of a traffic which brings the food, thewater, the fuel, and all other things they require to thepeople of the agglomeration.         When a nation goes to war its first step ie tocreate new agglomerations often on the largest scale.   Fleetsassemble at war bases;   armies appear in the field.   Like/civil
 civil agglomerations, these tcDO require traffic system of their own.  Unlike civil agglomerations they require not only things to use, but.many things to destroy.        Consequently the traffic demand of a war agglomeration is enormous and as these agglomerations are liable to move, their traffic0cannot have the permanency and therefore the economy of those of the civil agglomeration.        It follows that the first care of a state at v/ar should be to protect the three links of its food chain which include the corn lands where its food is grown, the machinery which collects, transports ana distributes it and the homes where it is consumed.  Similarly with its raw materials.        Not only however, must the central link (the traffic link)  be protected, it must be expanded to meet the needs of the new agglomeration and it must be maintained against the almost certain damage which the enemy will be able to inflict upon it.        Where there is no question of  military defeat, the first  visible sign that the service of the traffic has been ignored, will be the growth of anxiety about the food supply of the agglomerations.  If the traffic bemaintained food can cont muo to be grown in the places inwhich  it was grown in peace.   If the enemy should succeed in interrupting the traffic by  seizing the corn lands or byblockade or by destroying the carrying machines,  it becomes necessary to grow food where  it did not grov  in peace.        If this happens, the  enemy has won a considerate success.  He has compelled his adversary to utilise in growing food a portion of his Man-Power which otherwise would  have been available to  be used against him.
 This is now our position.  Through carelessness over the maintenance and expansion of     traffic we have been forced to divert a portion cf our Man-Power to break in land that ha3 not known the plough for a generation.        Having provided for the protection or its vitalcentres and its traffic, the second care of the state at war must be to equip Itself with and to maintain the tast, accumulation of machines of all sorts required to attack the enemy.  This attack may be its sole defence but in theory at least to secure its own life is the first cake cf the state at war.        If the line cf  thought which runs through the foregoing paragraphs be even approximately correctthis preliminary analysis of the theory of recruiting in thehighly industrialised modern nation at war has proceeded far enough to make it plain that not only the Armies requiremen and to render it possible to lay down certain provisional administrative principles to govern the withdrawal of men from civil life for military purposes.        Before stating v^hat these administrative principles should be, it is necessary to recognise that we have so suffered from false doctrine that a really scientific application of the rules is no longer possible to us. Knowing them, it may be possible to avoid further badmistakes and even to secure some measure of re-adjustment.
ADMINISTRATIVE PRINCIPLES OF RECRUITING.

As the modern army in the field is an agglomeration generally similar to a civil agglomeration, no age limits shouldbe imposed upon the rights of tho State to call upon men to service with the army. Physical unfitness to perform the work required should be the sole limitation.

NOTE: There are many men of 45, even of 55 who are much fitter and can more usefully and economically be    employed with the army than younger men, e.g. a B2 partner in an important textile firm aged 36,            employed on lebour with the army; contrast a labourer aged 52, remaining in civil life employed               on non-essential work.

The State must know accurately in individual detail what its male resourses are, what each individual is doing, where he is living, and where he is employed. This implies an acurate and enforces system of registration. It also implies the existence of some definite means of identification, e.g. the carrying of an identity book by all males. In this book, there would require to be a photograph of the individual to whom it belonged or else his finger-print record.

NOTE:- It present it is quite impossible to determine with absolute certainty the identity of many individuals whose interest it is to conceal it. Not only do men change their names, but there are many men with identical names, who can only be recognised by their address or employment, so that it is comparatively an ? matter for impersonation to occur, and moreover to thrive.

The registration system must be organised on a basis of occupation groups within which provision must be made for

/the
 the  recognition of age.   (3eo Appendix 7).               Ill ^ITHDLA^ING MSN PROM CIVIL LIFE FOR THE ARM EACH OP  THE REGI STRATI OH GROUPS SHOULD BE TREATED AS A UNIT AND SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO GENERAL RULES, NO INDIVIDUAL EXCEPTIONS BEING PERMITTED, EXCEPT AS HEREINAFTER PROVIDED.          NOTE:- The present exemption system is based almost                 entirely on individual or local considerations,                 thus the Tribunal of one seaside resort may                  exempt brthing box keepers in the interests of                 the national health, whereas the next, moro im-                  pressed by the military needs of the country,                  may refuse exemption to its fishermen.          Individual, domestic and financial interests 3hould no-fc Per se be a ground for exemption, but should be defclt with on a basis of compensation.   This implies that a Tribunal should decide the amount of compensation that the Stcte should rightlypay if it withdrew the indivithiel from civil life.    The callingup of the more expensive recruits would naturally be postponedby the State,  until such time as the pressure for men medc it necessary to incur the cost iovolvod.          NOTE:- This sysl&amp;n should apply  only to the owners of                 businesses,  largo or small,  not to employees                 nor to compensation for  the withdrawal of em-                 ploy ees.  The e ministration would not be diffi-                 cult.   It would be e&amp;sy  to  establish c scale of                 compensation - amounts which would be regarded                 as equivalent to a certain  increase in cge.          Individual exemptions should be  based on  oompassien- ate grounds only and then by  e. Tribune 1 administering  c  clearly defined scale.   For  example,  exemption might  be ^iven to  the only surviving male member of a family of  which  at  least onemember had lost his  life in the service of the  country.                                                    Similarly
Similarly one man out  of six might  &quot;be  exempted  if  five  sonswere serving in the Navy or Army.   Again,  a married man withseven children might be exempted,  a widower with five,  etc.          NOTE: Such exemptions,  though possibly illogical in  v                the interests  of  the State are  demanded on                grounds of public policy.   They appeal  to the                sentimental side  of the population and  do much                to cause the feeling of resentment against                compulsory exposure to a high risk of death                and mutilation.   Tribunals in dealing with                such cases should merely be required to                establish the  facts.   If established, exemption                should  follow  automatically and not be  at the                whin of a looal Tribunal.                Appeals from the  decisions of recruitingmedical  boards should,  in the interests of public confidence,be  allowed  to  all men.  They  should be dealt with by theexisting (lay)  appeal  tribunals.   These should decide  on theappeal with the assistance of not  less than two officialmedical  assessors,  who should be under an obligation to con-suit with the  President  of the recruiting medical board,whose decision was under  appeal  in all cases of difference ofopinion.                       GENERAL NOTES,                           . .                 The necessity of allowing appeals ae indi-cated ahove, makes necessary  the existence of  a Tribunal Bystemon  the general lines of  that  which we  now have.  Por reasons ofpolicy,  it  is  probably desirable that  no  profound change shouldbe  made  either in the  composition  or distribution of theTribunals.   Their powers  should, however,   be limited toascertaining matters of fact  such  as whether a man does ordoes not rightly belong to  an occupation  group and thereforeis  or is not subject to the conditions of  recruitment  attachedto  that  group  as well  as  the matters of faot indicated in thepreceding paragraphs.
THE EXISTING POSITION WITH REGARD TO RECRUITING.                The difficulties with regard to maintaining anadequare flow of men to the colours are well known.   It  is  amistake to believe that our resources in men remain  limitlessor even large.  Like all other countries after three years  ofwar we are feeling the strain.   We have raised  considerablearmies.   We have increased the manufacture of all warmachinery and munitions on a surprising scale.   We  havemaintained and expanded the fleet.   We are now  expanding theproduction of food.  All these activities neoeesarily absorbmen.  In result it is now possible to foretell with  fairoertainty the number of men who can still be withdrawn fromcivil life apart from, and in addition to the new crop as itmatures.  That number is not large and the difficultiesattendant upon the withdrawal of the men naturally increaseas the numbers of those who can be taken decrease.                If the position with regard to availablepersonnel be difficult, the psychological position is worse.                There is a feeling widespread in  the publicmindthat there&apos; is no national policy with regard  to  the  dis-tribution Of man-power.  The small tradesman is  at the momentin the very focus of the activities of the recruiting machine.He sees his friends and his neighbours called up.  He knowsthe ruin which awaits them cn their return.   He knows his ownturn is coming.  He sees the great Co-operative Stores and  thebig multiple shop organisations picking up the businesses whichwere theirs and his.  He hears that his neighbours who havejoined the colours have not been taken for  military duty buthave been incorporated in Agricultural Companies  of  TransportWorkers1 Battalions or are employed in delivering  coal toGovernment offices in London.                                                  /He
         He  lays the blame  at the door  of the War  Office, on the Government.  He points to the young men  in  the munitions sops as proof that the Government is in the  hands of a  capitalist armament ring or is frightened of the Trade  Unions.  He has no conception  of the position of the country or of the strain to which it is subject.  He understands nothing of the theory of recruiting.  His newspapers have dinned the  parrot cries &quot;Youngest First&quot; and &quot;Single Men First&quot; into his ears until he believes that these contain all the wisdom of the  moderns and the  ancients.         The other side is worse.  Young men  left in works and Factories in the national interest, believe  that as they ar6 young and single they should have been  taken for the Army, and would have been if the Government had dared.  Imagining it weak and afraid of them,  they despise it and in their despising fall victims  to the vapourings of the cranks and faddists who *lone talk to  them.         The nation is disturbed, rsrtly, by the excitement of the Russian Revolution;  partly by the price of food; partly by casualties,  by the sight of the widows and of the broken men returning, but largely,  because it does not understand the greatest of all problems, the problem of Man-Power upon which all else depends.        Further It is unhappily the fact that machinery for administering the problems of Manpower does not inspire confidence.   Ijhis  need occasion no surprise.  There is not, there never has been,  any authority,  except the Cabinet, responsible for, the  whole  administration of the Military Service etd. and the  Cabins.,  is not in itself an administrative body.        At the moment no less  than ten Government  Departments areresponsible  for the  administration of  parts  of  our system for ob-taining  recruits.  These are;the Local Government  Board,  the                                                  /Admiralty
 Admiralty, the Ministry of Munitions, the treasury, the Board of Trade, the Home Office, the Scottish Office, the National Service Department with the Reserved Occupations Committee, the Ministry of Labour, the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the War Office.        It is not surprising that a machine founded on an inapplicable theory, with ten heads each absorbed in a differ- ent urgent problem, should move with difficulty in any certain direction.        Not only is this inter-Department control cumbrous,but even within the fiold of a single office, the  War Office,there is a strange duality and a compartmenting which havetheir roots in history.        The pre-war Recruiting Department of the Army was asmall affair designed to receive men, to prepare their militarydocuments, and to distribute them to the various arms of thesorvice.  The man-collecting Department of to-day is a growthof the War.  It is split vertically into an administrativeside for which the Director of Recruiting is responsible anda medical side under the control of Wie Army Medical Department.In addition, outside London the whole machine is divided intocompartments, each of which is under the G.O.C  in-Chief cfthe oommand in whose territory it happens to be.        No Individual can be blamed for this state ofaffairs.A false philosophy of recruiting, no familiarity withwar on a grand  scale, hasty improvisation as  $ for a short war,are the ingedients which have created our &quot;system&quot;.        There is more to tell.  A civil registrationextemporised in time of war to limit and to act  as a brakeupon $he activities of a voluntary recruiting machine,  was                                                      /actually
1355actually made the basis of the administrative activitiesof a machine for compulsory recruitment and at the moment thiswas done the registration was already seven months out of date.Further, no means of establishing the identity of men in civilli fe existed or exists.           It i3 mot necessary to tell in detail the story ofthe twelve months May 1916 - May 1917*   It begins with chaos;anxious days grew into weeks,Wveks into months, as the machinegradually pulled itself into being out of that chaos;  slowlywere pieced together the broken materials with which the workershad to build.   At any time a single false step in central con-trol might have precipitated a crisis in the labour world athome or wrecked the carefully planned arrangements of the eom-manders in the field.           It is only just that the writer should acknowledge   \   Vthe tsnagnificent work done by the men who really did the work.Small in number byt not small in achievement, their extraordinarydevotion has enabled the machine to win through.   In May 1917the back of the work of primary re-organization was broken.The military registerswere almost all in order.   It waspossible to see the way clearly to a proper re-organisation ofthe military recruiting machine.           That this strange amorphous creation during itsbirth throes should have been able to meet the crisas it has metthe long strain of the Somme offensive,  the great traffic expansion of January, and have maintained the forces in the field, isno less remarkable than the machine itself.           It ie not safe however to trust to the machinecontinuing as it now is.   The men that  have pulled it throughare stale.   The wear and tear of keeping the wheels turninghas told heavily upon the personnel of al2r grades.   Before  thestrain of the preparations for next Spring&apos;s fighting fails  on
the machine, it must he simplified or it will fall.           It is not sufficiently realised that 3lst July is theend of the recruiting year so f&amp;f as that important business canhave an end till peace is signed.   By 31st July the last recruitsto he trained and ready to take the field before November havebegun their training.   There are thus three months, August,September &amp; October immediately ahead of us during which it isless dangerous to effect the transfer of system than at anyother time.           If we ace to do it this year, certainly two, possiblythree results have to be achieved.   First the theory upon whichrecruiting in a highly industrialised modern State can alone bebased, must be brought to the understanding of the people.Second the machine itself must be reconstructed so that it nolonger violates the first principles of its being, and it musthave its vertical cleavage and its compartmenting obliteratedand must be welded into a service.   Thirdly, its many heads mightwith advantage be merged in one..           Of theBe the first should, in my opinion, be taken inhand without delay; the second has been proceeding smoothly andquietly since the middle of May;  after the 1st August it will bereasonably safe to proceed more rapidly.   The third logically issound, administratively is not impossible but is the most diffic-ult of all.   It implies the placing of the military recruitingmachine under civilian control conceivably of the Local Goveivi-ment Board which already controls the Tribunal system or alter-natively of an Ad hoc Department to which the administration of                                            *the Tribunals should be transferred.   Thereafter, but not tillthe new machine has found itself, logically should come thelinking up of such great Departments as the Labour SupplyDepartment of the Ministry of Munitions.                                                    /Such
           Such far-reaching modifioationB  cannot however be1 ightheartedly undertaken.   If  the judgment that they arepossible within the time of grace  prove wrong the resultsmay be disastrous.            It will be well now to picture the organizationas it should be in  November an&amp; then to consider the steps inthe change.-
                                                            m              TMS MACHINE AS IT UAY BE IN NOVEMBER                   THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE.        The machinery for recruiting sketched in the followingparagraphs is not perfect,  No one is more aware than the writerof the criticisms to which it lies defencelessly open.  It isnot put forward as an ideal hut ae tho best which it ispossible to achieve within thz time limits which fate- imposes.It has to be built from^terials which should never have beenemployed hut which cannot now be scrapped.  It hx.s to bemanned by men who are only experts in so far as they have beenable to make themselves expert.  Ilany of them are old,practically all are physically unfit through long-standing,ill-health or through wounds, injury or sickness contractedin the war.-  These are the conditions,  and choice withinthem is limited.          Logically,  the Recruiting Service should be but onepart of a general kan-Power Department.   But whether this bearranged or not, whether the control of  recruiting remainsmilitary or becomes civil, under the Parliamentaay head of thecontrolling Department of State,  whichever that may be,  theremust be an Administrative Official whom  we may call theDirector General of aeeruiting.           Under the Director General of  ecruiting should bethe whole Admisiotrative Machine whioh collects men for theArmy.  The function of receiving men into the Army mustobviously remain a military function end just as in the daysbefore the War, that reception mu3t include  posting recruitsto various units or arms of the service,  and the preparationof their documents upon which their recognition and thepayment of their separation and dependants&apos;  allowanoe mustdepend.            Posting is not a simple business.   The judgmentthat is required to succeed in it  must be based upon intimateknowledge
of the requirements of the various arms,  their daily life intraining and in the field.   It must include a knowledge indetail of the physique and physical peculiarity of the man to heposted.   Thus, an individual who may he fit to wear theequipment and do the work  of a  gunner may he unfit to carry thepaok ahd do tho work of an infantryman.    This implies that theremust he a Military Medical Examination of each recruit as hejoins the army, for one of the  factors in determining hisposting is the existence or non-existence of physical peculiarities,which a medical man who knows the Army ia alone capahle ofappreciating.           This fact is fundamental and a considerableproportion of the detail of any non-military recruiting machineis determined by it.   We  shall return to it&apos;later but it isnecessary to keep the fact in mind, for: it&apos;colours much of whatfollows.   This short reference to it enables us, however, tograsp at once what the final function of the collecting part ofthe Recruiting machine is  -- it is to hand over to the Army anadequate $umber of sufficiently fit men to undertake one orother of the various types of duty which the Army Council has tocall upon men to perform in accordance with the military objectswhich the nation, represented by the Cabinet,  intends to achieve.It cannot be too strongly  insisted that it is the functionneither of the Army nor^of the  Recruiting Machine to determinethose objects.   Nor is it the  function Of the Recruiting Machineto consider what the Army  does  with the men handed over to it.In other words, the Recruiting  Machine,  whether under 3ivilianor Military Control, has as such no concern with the men itraises after they cross the threshold of the Army.           Once this ie grasped, the dutlee and functions of theRecruiting Machine are clear.   An appreciation of its essentialorganisation follows almost inevitably.                                                  /The
                                                              0 p il                                                        17.       The hasis ot the whole machine must he an accurateregister of all males in civil life.  Even if the fallacioushypothesis of a* period of military ago ending at forty-one hemaintained it is necessary if the machine is to envisage itsproblem, that it shculd know what men exist in civil life,where they live, and how they are employed;       This means that the machine- wi11 Work round itsregister which will be a vast affair covering millions cf men.       Tho very size of this register determines the nextstep.   It must be broken up into seotions referring togeographical areas and for purposes of administration each ofthese aroa Should correspond precisely v/ith the area of anAppeal Tribunal- not necessarily with the Aroa of an AppealTribunal as it is now, but with tho Aroa of an Appeal Tribunalin November.       Further, for admin.-iterative purposes it is absolutelyessential that these areas in so fer as they include grctcities and agglomerations should inolude whole population units.Thus it is productive of :.dministr!.tivc difficulty und unprofit--ablo expenditure to include in an uro-.v the working portion of agreat city and exclude from that ore^ the residential districtswhich aJe the dormitories of the workers.       We thus reach our first principle of organisation,viz, For administrative reasons it is nocossury to divide thecountry into areas wfeich in thickly peopled districts must eachcover the working :j.d dormitory districts of a population unit.Further, each of those ureaB should be as far as possibleidentical jrith the territory of on Appeal Tribunal.        The Second organisation principle is *pruetica*ly acorollary of the first.  It is     In districts in which thepopulation is sparse, and paople work In the immediate neighbour-hood of their homes, suoh areas should correspond with the                                                     /territory
 territory of an existing. Appeal Tribunal.       These principles at once determine practically a county organisation of recruiting with a series of special City Areas superadded.       If the register id to be split in this way we have a further need.  It is not practicable for a central office to deal satisfactorily with a stress of correspondence originating from seventy or eighty areas.  If it be attempted, it leads to centralisation, to correct ?/hich a tribe of inspectors has to be appointed.       Our third principle of organisation is therefore clear:- It is desi&amp;a ble to group the oreps in some convenient way and to place at the head of each of-these groups an offioial who will be the local representative of the Director General.       Hany groupings are possible.  One seems to be eminently desirable.  The country is already divided for the purposes of the Employment Exchange Service into Divisions. There are  -many questions in which the Employment Exchange and Recruiting Services are equally interested. It seems desirable therefore to fellow, with one modification, which need not detain us, this division of the country. It is proposed that the grouped areas.ahould be called Recruiting Regions and should each be under aDirector.       The proposed Regions,  eleven in number ,&apos;are indioated inAppendix 1.       We thus complete our first view of the machine that is tobe,       At the centre, under a Parliamentary Chief, a Director General of Recruiting;under him, each at the head of a RecruitingRegion,eleven Directors of Recruiting:under each of these  six, seven or more Deputy Directors each in charge of a RecruitingArea                                                     /These

Tho areSSwill be registration units and for oach there will be an appeal tribunal. A full liet of the suggested Areaswith their proposed headquarters will also be found in Appedix 1             now       It iB/nacessary to consider in more detail theadministration and working of the machine which has boon sketchedin broad outlines.       It&apos; is evident that the Director General and hisDirectors and Deputy Directors will have four main interestsEach of hie own degree will have to concern himself with themaintenance of the machine  itself. This includes administrationof the personnel,provision of accommodation and tho maintenanceof the register. Each will have to consider the intricate legalproblems by whioh recruitment is surrounded. Inextricablylinked with those there is a wob of exemptions by agreement andby: Government pledge,       Each too will have tc deal with the question of gettingmon into the Army, which in the oases of the Director General,Yand Directors, implies that thoy will have to concern themselveswith the Tribunals; tho Colliery Recruiting Courts,the EnlistmentComplaints Committees  and that elaborate system, for  the releasecf mon ftom Munitions Works known as the Munitions  Area Scheme.       Finally each toe will be vit .ally concerned with thedifficult preblom of determining v/hich men are modically fit  and:.which are not.       Those groups &quot;of duties automatically determine theorganisation of tho Director General*s Staff and the  Director&apos;sStaffs in four Sections:-                                                1. The.
             1,       The Administrative Branch.              .       The Legal Branch.             3.       The Executive Branch.             4.&quot;       The I;k:dical Branch.             In the HCaottuarter Office each of these branches should be under an  assistant Lirector General;  in the Regional  Offices under an Assistant Director.               i.             The size of the central office would be considerable. Including provision for,dealing with parliamentary enquiries it should be organised to have a capacity for handling 3000  to 4000 letters a day outward,  excluding circulars and printed matter.             The capacity of the Directors&apos; Offices should be not less than 400 to 500 letters a day outward, excluding circulars, printed roattor and transmissions from tho headquarters office to the Areas,  except in London in whioh the office should be designed to handle not less than 1500 letters a day outward,  excluding circulars and printed matter.   In London there would be no transmissions as in accordance with our first principle of organisation there would be only  one Area.            In the ^rea Offices there would necessarily be a some-what similar organisation of the  -staff but  the  head,  of each of the four branches would be-  an executive official.            The duties  of the Deputy Directors  in charge of .*reasare considered in Appendix 11.            The general questions of registration, vouching identification etc.,  are considered in appendix 111,            The necessary statutory provisions  which would beaffected if tho machine were  transferred  from Military to  Civiliancontrol, arc considered in  Appendix IV.            v/e may now  with advantage  consider  the arrangements  for
medical  examination ana  appeal in so far as tho RecruitingMachinery is  concerned.
 The Medical  Side          The Mature  of  the Problem.           To^ostablish Sound principles  for the  efficient administration  of the medical portion  of  the organisation for recruiting  is not an easy problem.   As a preliminary,  it is  necessary to define  what the purpose of the existence of the medical branch  is, and  what ere its limitations.  It has already been shown that  the recruiting machine can have no control over the men who have been collected by it after they enter the Army.   When  recruits cro3S the threshold of military service, looked at from the,point of view of those whose functions it has been to collect the men end to hand tliem over to the  Army,  it my be said that a eurtcin falls behind the recruits, and the Recruiting Medical Service has no further ndministrative power or concern with the numerous Medical problems arising immediately men come under the widely varying conditions of service within the Army.           Similarly the recruiting service as such can have no opinion as to whether the Army is  having allotted for its purposes either too many or too few men.   The  function of the Recruiting  Department  is  to collect an adequate  number of sufficiently fit men to meet  tho demands made upon it by the Army  in order to carry out  the  policy determined by the Government.    Whether the men selected -.nd  supplied by the Recruiting  organisation r;re to be used for  infantry,Artillery, Plying  Corps or Tanks is no ooncern  of the Service whose duty it is to collect men.             It follows that it is  no part  of the  function of the medical seotion of the recruiting machine to indicate to
 what arm of the Service a recruit shall be posted.  This greatly simplifies the problem pieced before the medical men constituting Recruiting Medical Boards whose takk it is to give satisfactory answers to sufficiently, difficult medi cal ques t i ons .       In the past and at present the Recruiting Medical Boards throughout the country hove been attempting to perform two functions.   The first of these  is to determine whether a man is or is not physically fit to enter the Army.   Tho socond is to classify the men whom they consider sufficiently fit&apos;for some form of service in categories from which the posting of men to various Corps and Army Units can readily he effected.       Much misunderstanding oxists on this point,  not only in the mind of the general public.   The familiar categories;  A.  Bit 01.  etc.,  are commonly spoken of as medical categories;   they are not so.    Frimarily those categories aro to be considered as a form of administrative shorthand founded it is  true on medical information furnished by iho members of the Bocruiting Medical  Boards. Consider,  for example, the first four of these categories.   * The sign All  means that  the man is fit  for service  in tho Field,  trained,  equipped and ready&quot;to proceed to a theatre of wair.    A 2. means the Same as A 1. with  thoexception that this symbol indicates that the training                                           Ae of the men is  not  yet completed,  and shoulc^be  sent to atheatre of war,  he  will  require to be sent in aspecial draft  which will undergo further training at the                                             Base
 Base  before he  is perfectly  fit  to  join  the  fighting unit. A.3 marks  a man who has a ready  served overseas, who requires further  training or  hardening before he can be sent  abroad again.  A*4 indicates a man  physically  fit, untrained  or possibly trained, but not to be sent overseas as is age  is. not  yet Id years; and so on in  the case of  the other categories  3., C., etc.  Each of these is mainly adminstrative,  but founded on medical indications 6&apos;iven by a  Medical Board.  These categories have been thus elaborated to serve as guides to Costing and Drafting Officers and are  only in part based on the results of medical inspection and examination.      Classification of a man  in  one of the existing categories is therefore a function of the Army and its medical service,  for which the recruiting machine should not in fact undertake effective  responsibility.      It is, however, necessary that men of v/idely       physical different/capacity and development shall be supplied to the Army^ because there is not a sufficient number of perfectly fit men in the Country to meet the noeds of the Army as laid down by the Government and by the &apos;/ar Cabinet on behalf of the Nation.    It must always be borne in mind that a modern Army is an agglomeration of individuals not differing in kind from a large civilian community.   It follows,  speaking broadlyi with certain obvious exceptions and qualificationsi that every man who is fit to earn his living in civilian life is aleo  fit tobe employed in some capacity suited to his conditionwithin the  Army.  It is to be remembered that employment in a modern Army covers all sorts of conditions of existance,                                                     from
from that of the Clerk who lives in his own home, who worksregular hours.  , and who has suitable food at stated times,to that of the man who leads a life of strenuous exertion,and who has to make forced marches and has to take part insavage hand-to-hand fighting.     It is, therefore, necessary for the recruiting machineto establish certain broad principles of classificationfor the men supplied to the Army.,  It would be uselessto supply 1,000 fit men for employment only as clerks underconditions closely resembling those of civilian life, when the demandof   the Army is for 1,000&apos; fighting men.Classification therefore there must be,  but the Classifi-cation must be clearly medical without administrativecomplications.     There are three main categories which can be determinedon medical grounds and the first of these can be furthersub-divided.   They are:-      A.        1. Men free from serious defect or organic desease,        of good muscular development,  actual  or potential        the movement of their joints unimpaired, there        speoial senses acute, of good intelligence,  and  at        the time of being handed over to  the  Army,  free        from  such contagious  or infectious  deseases as are        transient or teadily  transmitted, or  not rapidly        curable.        2.  Men fulfilling  the  above conditions  but  whose        special  senses,  e.g.&quot;eyesight, may  be  below        the normal  standard,  but nevertheless                                              sufficiently
       sufficiently good for all practical purposes.   These men are capable of general service in theactive army.  They should  hot be less than five feet instature with the exception of healthy men required forcertain special  services.       B.   -         L Men  with defects of such character as do not       interfere with their normal avocations in civilian       life, or  with organic deseases not likely to be                                       1       incapaciting for  a period or two  or three years.       Their disabilities must not be of such a nature       or  degree as to render them unfit for  service or       likely to become  rapidly increased under Army       conditions  e.  ge  they must not require an       invalid diet,  nor  must they be unable  to perform       the  duties to  which they are allotted  v/ith       regularity;  and they must be at least  of fair       intelligencec.   They must be free  from  such contag       ious or infectious deseases as are transient.       readily transmitted,  or  hot rapidly curable.  These men are  required  to  perform the  multifarious        AUXILIARY services  essential to  the  effeoiency        of  a modern Army.       C.        1.   Men whose defects  or  disabilities,  plysical        mental  are so severe a degree as to  render                                                   them
       them totally unfit for service with the Army.     A classification such as this is based on medical observation allowing of an opinion being formed that t&amp; the man is  free of organic defect and disease, or otherwise. It can be  Stated with confidence thai if a man i3 free from serious organic disease the life of the soldier will in the vast majority of cases improve his health and physical condition  to a very marked extent.  On the other hand if he  doe3  suffer from defect or disease not likely to increase or to become seriously aggravated within a period of a few years, and altogether in his case physical exercise or training may have to be entirely avoided,  there is no  reason wiry such a man should not serve in the Army   in an auxiliary capacity by working e,g, as an Army Tailor, Shoemaker, Tradesman or Clerk.     The disability resulting from defective vision may serve  to illustrate 3ome of the conditions determining the classification indicated.   There is nc reason why a short 3ighted man should not  be employed on active service in the Army if he is healthy and physically fit in other&apos; respects, end if the defective vision is not  too great in degree and is not progressive  in character,                              to provided that the Army is able/furnish him with glasseswhich will to a large extent obviate the results  ofhis disability on the one hand,  or on the other hand is able to employ him on duties  for which perfect vision is not required.   A man may be  quite incapable of sightinga gun,  but may be perfectly competent to carry up the  shell
and to load it.     Many men placed in lower categories by RecruitingMedical Boards on account of defective eyesight, absenceof fingers, or similar, defects may after they havepassed into the Army be given occupations in which theirdisabilities may be allowed for 0* corrected.  If theyare otherwise sound and in good health, they may be.raised to a higher oategory permitting them to beemployed anywhere so long as the conditions of correctionor allowance for defects are maintained.  Such changes ofclassification frequently occur, and the criticism so oftenheard that the categories of men are repeatedly andarbitrarily, changed is made under the mistaken beliefthat these categories now so well known to the publicare purely medical: in character.     It is therefore, quite impossible for therecruiting machine to determine into which of thecategories established for administrative purpooes the menshould be placed.  The medical service of the recruitingorganisation can note physical deformities,  detect organicsoundness or un3oundness,  it can estimate from medical experience whether a men1s Organic unsoundness is likelyto increase or to be fetal within a certain space of time.It can determine with fair certainty whether s m^n issuffering from contagious or infectious, disease or not.   Itcertainly is unable to determine with any accuracy whethera men shall be fitted into such and such a niche in the  Armybecause from the nature of its organisation it ha3 noknowledge of the vacant positions and occupations in the                                                /Army

                      The organisation required.     Just as the case of the Administrative side so also in the case of the medical department of Recruiting the REGION must be considered as the Main Division,, with the Area as the Medical Recruiting Unit.  At each Regional^adq^iaxt-era-on^^ Staff of the Director there must be a duly qualified medical man giving whole time service.  This medical officer will be responsible for the medical administration within the Region^ including such details as the aare of medical documents and the compilation of medical statistics.  Working under his directions are the Recruiting Medical Boards of the Region varying in number according to the population of the Region and the distance to be covered in travelling.  One of these Boards will he placed at each Area Headquarters,  and will be under the immediate observation  of the Medical Officer on the Deputy Directors Staff If there be only one Board in the Area he will act as President: If there be mere than one Board as Supervising Medical Officer. The Area Headquarters Board3 will probably be in daily Session.     With the exception of the Presidents the --personnel of the Boards will he selected from the medical men in civilian practice in the various Administrative Areas.     At this point it is advisable to consider the constitution of the Recruiting Medical Boards as they exist at the present time.   The following table gives the number Of theRecruiting Medical Boards,  and the number of medical men employed as whole  or patft time Officers during the month of June 1917.  -                               Recruiting Medical Board.

It will be seen that of 138 Boards, 104 are described as&quot;permanent&quot; end this total may be reckoned in the meantime asthe number required under normal conditions.      Of the totnl number of 886 medical men employed 28 ereregular officers a few of whom have had experience of civilianzaedical practice, 43 are Retired Officers of the various ser-vices, some of whom have experience of civilian medical work,56 are officers of the Territorial Force practically all of whomwere fully engaged in civilian practice up to the outbreak of War..115 are Medical Officers holding temporary Commissions in theRoyal Army Medical ftorps who till very recently have beenemployed fully in Civilian Medical work, and 644 are civilianmedical practitioners actually engaged at the present time incivilian practice in the Areas in which thoy reside.   It willbe noted that the overwhelming majority of medical men engagedin Recruiting work are doctors with lon&amp; and wide experience ofcivilian practice,  and with a knowledge of the social conditionsof the people more thorough in some ways than that possessed byany other section of the Community.      The personnel of these Boards  should consist  of aPresident and from two to four medical members acting at anyone session,  with clerks, and assistants as may bo  foundneoessary.    To provide the number of  acting members, a largernumber/
number of practitioners must be attached to the Board.    Incomparatively few instances will it be found possible  to  securethe services of local medical men for whole-time or continuouswork on the Board.    In the great majority of1 cases a  plan tobe recommended and found to work well by experience, is to forma panel of medical men in local practice larger than the  numberrequired by the 3oard at any one session;  and to leave therotation of attendance and date3 of service of its  members forarrangements locally.    Arrangements on lines suggested abovewill involve part time services from 600 to 700 medical Prac-titioners.
                                                    34.                                                     t      The Supervising Medical Officer ofl the Medical Boardsin important or populous Areas must he a medical manprepared to give whole time service.   In the cess of Boards inles3 populous centres, or of Boards sitting intermittentlyother arrangements are possible.   The choice of the PresidentmuSt/Jh every case be made with discrimination as the efficiencyof the President is the main condition of the efficiency of hisBoard.   He must be a man of good medical experience andknowledge, able to secure the professional confidence of hiscolleagues.    In addition he should have some knowledge  ofadministration so as to be able to regulate his Board, andshould possess by temperament the power of securing theconfidence of the people with whom he has to deal especially ofits young men.   A knowledge of military affairs,  and theconditions of the soldiers life will be of much service  to thePresident, and this qualification will not be difficult  tosecure in the future inasmuch as  practically the whole of themembers of the Medical Profession of age suitable to act asPresidents will have had experience of active Military 8ervice.It has already been found that Territorial Officers,  and Officersholding temporary Commissions, who have had long experienceof civilian medical duty readily  become ^ood Presidents  ofRecruiting kledical Boards.   About one hundred medical mencapable of acting as Presidents will be required.   The membersof a Medical Board will always act in close co-operation andin consultation with the President.   In case3 in which evenlybalanced difference of medical opinion accurs the Presidentwill have a casting vote in addition to his vote  as a memberof the Board.                                    .   to      Further as it will not be possible /form numerous                                                   Appeal/
Appeal Medical Boards throughout the Country, and theadvantage of a second medical opinion as to fitness for serviceis often demanded by recuits and valued by Tribunals, twoexperienced Medical Practitioners should be attached to theAppeal Tribunals as Assessors.  They should be empowered toconsult with the President of the Recruiting Medical Boardsin all cases where difficulty arises from Medical reasons inthe Appeal before these Tribunals.   This provision will requirethe part time services of about 150 Medical Practitioners.      In addition a Medical Boird at the Headquarters ofeach recruiting Region might be established to act as a 8pecialor Appeal Medical Board.       It will thus be seen that about 1000 medical menwill be required to complete the establishment of the MedicalBoards of the Recruiting organisation,  a certain number ofthese will be employed wholly in recruiting medical work, themajority will give part time services.      Further it should be noted that if Recruiting be placedunder civilian control,  Military Medical Boards will still  benecessary at the recruit receiving  stations to classify men inthe administrative categories required for posting purposes.This will absorb from 300 to 400 Medical Officers.      A reorganisation of the Recruiting Service undercivilian control will require therefore  the State to  obtain theservices of an additional 400 to 500 doctors who will of coursebe withdrawn in lar^e measure from  civilian practice.      The difficulty of providing medical practitioners toserve on Recruiting kedic?.! Boards  without detriment  uo thehealth of the people is *t the present time very considerable.The supply of Doctors in the countrynis  by no  means unlimited,*nd    some districts have already  too few for the needs of theCivilian Population.  Many of the medical men remaining arc                                                      either/
      too old or aro not in sufficiently goad health to  stand tho    in of serving on those Ledical Boards. The Doctors remaining ! tho Country at tho present time aro very fully occupied :rith-    lodioal care of the Civilian Population on tho one hand,  and lso in assisting to attend to the sick and wounded  soldiers eturncd from Overseas,   Speaking generally, the younger and the 9vo active part of the medical profession is now actually engaged n  Military Service with tho Army abroad.   For these reasons the hoico of competent Ledical Ptactitioners to serve on the Recruiting odioal Boards falls within very narrow limits.   The finding and election of the medical men on whom will fall the arduous and ssponsiblc duties of the Recruiting Medical Boards  must,  however, t  longer be left in any way to chance.  They must be carefully icked for their special work.  The selection of medical ractitioners for this Service must be organised, and the best ,,en to undertake this work arq the members of the medical rofession Itself.         Fortunately the medical profession has developed a  system f  Central and Local War Committees during the progress of the War, which may be ltokcd upon as being in a very high degree represents- tivo of the profession throughout Great Britain.     This  system has een established for the purpose of supplying suitable medical men to  undertake Military Service in the Royal Army Uodioal Corps, rtiilc at the same time safeguarding the necessities  of the Civilian Population so far as medical attention is concerned.   The trganisation representing the Royal College of Physicians  and ofSurgeons in England, through their Joint Committee,  known as  theCommittee of Reference is mainly concerned with the  medicalservice in the Metropolitan Area.  The Committee of  Reference  alsoicts in the closest association with the body known  as the Central -cdical War Committee.  This Central Committee represents  on  the0&apos; e hand in a very complete manner the body of the profession throughEngland and V/alea and also the British I ledical Association.    Thebo Committees acting conjointly regulate the number of Ledical .fract it loners to be retained for Civilian service throughout
                                                                     37.  England and \7ales  and  supply suitable medical  men for service in  the  Royal Army  Lledical Corps., The  latter  duty is carried out in  association ?rith the Army  &quot;edical Service  and  its Director General,  The  Central :.cdical &quot;lex Committee performs this very important duty  by means of some 1^0 branches known as  Local :.Iedical V/ar Committees  established in  all parts of  England and ^ales.     These  Local  Committees were elected by the members  of  the  profession throughout  the  country early  in the War and have been recently re-elected for  service during  the month of  June 191*7 c           Similarly in Scotland the Scottish War  Emergency Committee  representing the Scottish  Universities, .\&apos;cdical Corporations, the  general body of the profession in Scotland ano  the 3ritish Medical  Association performs the same functions as the  above mentioned  Corami11ees In Eng1and.end  Wales.           By private arrangement In Commands and  from Headquarters  of the Recruiting  Service  these Local Medical  V&apos;ar Committees  have  already been giving valuable assistance in the  selection of medical men  for  the purpose of serving on the existing Recruiting 1&apos;edical Boards.           The three Committees mentioned.,  namely,  the Committee of  Reference of tho Royal College of Physicians and  Surgeono in  England and the Central Medical r&apos;ar Committee  ano1 the Scottish Y^ar  Smergency Committee, are bodies recognised by  Statute ao  Professional Coi-uTiittees under the I  ilitary Service -Lets.           It may be also mentioned  that in Ireland a similar  medical  organisation exists In close association with the Central Tedical i7ar  -  Committee although the Irish reclical *.&apos;&apos;ar Committee has not yet been  developed to the extent of the corrospending medical bodies in  Great Britain.           It appears that  an organisation  on the  lines sketched in  the  foregoing paragraphs is  the most satisfactory that can be  devised th ough the Interests and medical  care  of  the civilv  population will require to be most  carefully safeguarded.                                                                    It
          It-is proposed that  the whole  of  the  medicalrgahisatien  concerned with  recruiting  should he administered by radical Assistant Director General  on the  Staff of the  Directoreneral of Recruiting at Headquarters.
          If it be decided to place the recruiting machine der civilian control the work should proceed in three tagee.          First the announcement  of the decision should be ,&amp;de and the  necessary legislation prepared and passed. mediately thereafter the permanent officials of the new sadquartcrs  and regional  offices  should be nominated.   If iot already employed on recruiting duties they should all 3 granted temporary commissions as Lieutenants and be ttachod to the  existing machine to learn what their duties 111 be  and what recruiting is.         The  second stage,  the transfer of the machine rom its present to its future  organisation should be carried ut  under the  guidance  of  the  existing staff (See appendix V).         The  third stage  the  actual transfer to civilian ontrol  should be effected on  a date to be fixed say rovisionally  15th  October 1917.         The  issues  at stake  are  too serious to allow ofhe  transfer being  effected without most  carefulupervision and  with all the weight that  tho writer canring to bear, he ventures to urge  that  no sudden breakith the  tradition  and  past  of the  organisation bettempted.   If  it  be,  a period of  chaos  is  inevitable.

                            APPENDIX  3.                         REGISTRATION.           To eliminate the increasing volume of dead entriesappertaining to men already posted to E%MaForces and to allowfor the &quot;better concentration Of the machine upon the actualwork in hand the following scheme of re-organisation isproceeding throughout the country and advantage is being takenof the opportunity to simplify the existing recruiting records..The rewriting of the military registers (wCrk which even underthe present system is absolutely essential) has been begun andat the same time systematic checks upon all present recordsappertaining to the men still remaining in civil life, havebeen instituted.  This will carry out an effective and reliable&quot;stocktaking&quot; upon the man power of the country and the generaloccupations upon which they are engaged..            To reduce to the lowest possible minimum anyinconvenience and annoyance caused by correspondence, enquiries,and the issue cf calling lip notices in order to obtain certainnecessary particulars from the general public on the one handand th reduce the considerable volume of reference and dupli-cation thrown upon tho existing Registration machinery, on theother, it has been decided to allot a definite and distinctivenumber to each man still remaining in civil life o.       Byencouraging the use of this number both upon the registrationcertificate Issued by the local Authorities,  and upon allcorrespondence appertaining to recruiting matters generally muchadministrative work will be saved.            Further it has been decided completely to eliminateall distinction between married and single  or between grouped orclassed men,  in so far as recruiting returns  and statistics areconcerned and to rely upon the actual year  of birth and the                                                      records
 records of each individual for all purpose:., &quot;hich such subdivisions  oa:- serve.    This will obviate the necessity for a variety of calling up  notices, and will make possible the use or&apos;  one  a; proved ana suitably uorded for-:] oi&quot; calling u; notice uhen  ordering men to report for military service, as distinct from  medical  examination. Iiilitary Regis trati on.           The information  obtained at registration is supplied to  the military authorities on a form known as the &quot;Pink I-orm&quot; from which are  prepared  the working registers.           The basis or military registration will now be the-rea military Register, army J*orm If. 3624, which consists ofbooks ox 100 pages  on the  cheque  book principal,  with adetachable page  and a permanent counterfoil for each man, eachpage having a permanent number printed on it.    These books arearranged in Occupation Groups  according to  the probableavailability or non-availability  for  service  ox men  of theseoccupations, e.g.Occupation  roup  1 consists  of Railwaymen,Occupation Group 3 Agriculturalists,  etc.,(.lee Appendix 5).          On receipt of the pink  form from  the civilauthorities the following  steps are taken:-V/hite Oard Index. 1st., A white  card  (..rmy ;orm &quot;J.315&amp;:)  isprepared, giving name,  address  and occupation.   These cardsare arranged in strict alphabetical order and  thus form theindex: to the Area register.  This  index is  divided into  twosections, a &quot;live&quot;  and a &quot;dead&quot; section,  DO long as a manremains in civil life in the ^rea, his  white card remains inthe &quot;live1&apos; index, but if he removes from the area, joins the...rmy or actually dies,  his card is transferred  to the  &quot;dead&quot;index.iled Oard Incle:;.  ... red card  (.. rmy i-erm J.31533) ,is also                                                     prepared/

If for any resson a man is transferred from the occupation group of that torsi this red  card is disposed of accordingly.           Ah entry is mado in the Occupation G-roup of the .: rea &apos;Jte*ister  (.^rmy J-orm v7.3624)  to which his employment belongs,  and the number  in the register is marked on the white card and red card,-and on the Pink Porm..  This number, kno-n as  the Region Number,  is the Indentifying number of the aan  so  long as he remains  in the  Occupation Group and is marked  on all  papers and documents referring to him,  which are  all iiled  in series of 100,  so that all documents relating  to  men In one register  are together.           On the  page  of the book,  in  addition to his name, address,  year  of  birth etc., is entered all information affecting  his military position,  but on the counterfoil onlypermanent  information is shown until such  tiae as he  Isremoved from the  Occupation Group  when the  final  informationregarding his position is  shown.          When for any reason  a. man is  romoved from anOccupation Group  the page  is removed and in its place  isattached  (by means&apos; of a puimnec edge) an ray U-orm, slightlyshorter in length, vouching for the removal of the man  fromthis section of the register.          The object of this arrangement is twofold:-1st,  To show at a glance that the entry is  closed so far as     that particular register is concerned,2nd.   j p-ive In easily accessible fora, proox  that the man has     been properly dealt with.Reasons for Removal, The chief reasons for  a man Veinr: removed-roro a section are a^j follows:-

That he is an absentee, or      5,   That he is aotually dead.  ,          In the first second and fifth eases the entry isclosed as far a3 the  particular area is concerned, and the::oll:;winv  rocedure takes; place:-,   (a)  Tie  vvhite card is removed from the &quot;live&quot; to the &quot;dead&quot;        indie?:.   (b)  The  page of the  register is abstracted, and the red        -card and documents dealt with according to the nature        of the casualty.           In the third  b fourth cases,  the page in the MilitaryRepister is  abstracted,  and the  red card and all documentsreferring to the man  are  transferred  to  the Occupation Groupin the registers in which an entry  is made,  an&quot;, the number inthat section is now tho njanTs Region  Humber,  and is marked&quot; onhis &quot;hite end red cards  and  documents.Particulars  of Transfer.

You &quot;ought to  maize it  a condition that the civilian  body find the -/hole of  the men  and  that it is only after the  men have gone &quot;through the various processes to  see whether they can be &quot;spared from the civil.employment,  whether they  are fit for the &quot;various categories of service for which the Army requires men &quot;that it is  only then  alone - that the Army comes in.&quot; and later,  &quot; -ay  I take  this as an imaginary room.  The recruit &quot;conies  in  at one door  to this room, where  are  sitting  the &quot;various bodies  who will have to deal with  him.   The first &quot;thing  that  will be  done will be to see  whether  he can be &quot;spared from t.\e industry  in  wMich he is employed.  The Medical &quot;Board will  see  whether &apos; e  is fit for any of the. categories. &quot;The  Civil Liability Bo* rd  and all  the  other Boards  will  also &quot;be civilian.  If the man  canrot be spared  from  Mis  work,  or &quot;if lie is-unfit  he will po  out  the door  he  came  in by,  but  if &quot;he is fit and can be spared, he will go out by  the  other door, &quot;and  only then will he come into the hands  of the Military. &quot;lir. Rees -  &quot;Of  course he can appeal  to  the  Tribunal&quot;.  Lord &quot;Derby - My  statement is only metaphorical&quot;.          This a; pears to indicate that  the  functions of theLllitar/ authorities will begin  only upon the man being actually received into the Army.  Under  a voluntary  system the Military Authorities1 first  function would be to attest theman,as it is the actual attestation which enlists a man under
 z voluntary system.   Under the Military service  ots, however, men of military age are deemed as from the appointed elate to have he en duly enlisted into &quot;is -Majesty^ Regular &quot;orces for peneral service with the Colours or in the ;io serve for the period of the ;&apos;ar, and to have been forthwith transferred to the Reserve.   It would seem, therefore, that under the ;proposed alteration or system, the Civil authority must notify the appropriate  -Military authority that a man is available for calling up for Military service, and that the duties of the Military authority will bopin with the issue to the  man of an order  calling  u on him to&quot;report for military service.   It yould be possible b;  co-operation hetween the ldlitar-/  and Civil Authorities to  arrange  that the ord.er to re ort for military  service  should be issued by the  Civil . uthority.   This  would need.very close co-operation,  as  it would v?ean that the  Civil  uthority would  have to  be  in possession of information  as  to  the destination for  disposa-l of men ordered  -or military  service.   It would be  done,  of course, by the  Civil- Authorit? ordering the Dan to report to the  a pro  riate Depot, there  to  be  posted,  to a Unit. Transferring, to the  Civil /uthority the  dut;y of issuing oallinp up notices would simplify  the  procedure as res; ects absentees  and deserters, as it rould  be  for the CivilAuthority  then  to  brinp the man  to  the .military Depot  to  be; osted to  a military Unit.           If this  scheme were  adopted,  the  Reserve  orcesAct,  1882, in so far i-.z it relates  to  bringing  men to  aMil it. IT Depot, for posting,  r;onld  be  administered by  theCivil  instead of the military .. uthority.  ooie  minoramendments in the Reserve ,orces  ct, 1802, v-ould benecessary, but - reclamations and. directions  pivsn inpursuance of Proclamation under tM.e Reserve : orces . ct -say
be given by any Principal Secretary of States and when given are effective as if enacted in the Reserve Forces Act. The provisions in Sections 15 and 16 of the Reserve Forces at authorising the taking into military custody of a deserter or an absentee would require attention, as a man should only be taken into military custody under the proposed new system after he has been handed over to the Military Authority by the Civil Authority. These two Sections deal with men who are charged with being deserters or absentees from the Army Reserve.

Sub-section (2) of Section 5 would also require amendment, and also Section 6.

With respect to the Military Service Acts, 1916, and 1917, certain amendments would be necessary. Sub-section (2) of Section 1. of the Military Service Act, 1916, applies the Army Act to any man who is deemed under the Military Service Act to have been enlisted and transferred to the Reserve. A provision would be necessary restricting the application of the Army Act to a man who had been made available for military service by the Civil Authority having brought him to a Military Depot.

Sub-Section (2) of Section 2. requires consultation with the Army Council prior to the issue of Government Department of Certificates of exemption.

Section 3 (1) refers to the powers of application for review of certificates of exemption by any person generally or specially authorised for the purpose by the Army Council, And paragraph 1. of the second Schedules makes a like reference in the case of appeals from the decisions of Local Tribunals and Appeal Tribunals.

Section 10 (1) of the Military Service Act, 1916,(section 2) gives, power to any person who has authority for the purpose from the Army Council to require the production of
tf a certificate.        Section 1(1) sf the Military Service  (review  tfExceptions) Act, 1017, provides that the Army  Council  mayrequire men te present themselves for re-examination.        The first proviso gives the Army  Council  power toirder a man to he re-examined within six months of hisprevious rejection or discharge where it appears to theCouncil that the previous rejection or  discharge was obtainedby fraud.        The so references to  the Army Council  would have  to heamended by a reference to tha Civil Authority.        Section 12 of the Military Service Act, 1916,(session 2) gives power  to the  Army Council to arrange forthe  transfer to  the Reserve  of  any  member  of the RegularForces  er for  the  temporary  demobilisation of any member ofthe  Territorial Force.        Paragraph  (b) of the Becand proviso to Section 1 oftho  Military Service  (Review of Exceptions) Act, 1917,exoepts certain  Officers or  men from  the  Operation ef theAot  if  they have left  the naval *r  military service tf theOr awn in consequence  of  disablement,  if the disablement hasbeen oertified under  tho authority  of  tho  Admiralty or theArmy Council te  be  the result of wounds received In battleetc., or  in consequence  ef neurasthenia.        Presumably in these  casos  the  power would be left tothe  Army  Council.         The Army  Act, Reserve  Forces Act  and other Actswould require  detailed and careful  examination when the exactscheme  of  transfer  has been  settled to  ascertain whether anyfurther amendments  are requisite, but,  speaking generally, nfetoastio statutory  amendments  appear to  be  necessary.(
