^i^o   80BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND fflSHBSIES. Report for week ended 25th July, 1917.POTATO DISEASE.          It has now become evident that a large acreage ofpotatoes is infacted with wart disease.    This disease hasbeen present in the country for many years, and has graduallyspread until it has infected a very large area, chiefly inthe west of England, the Midlands and Wales.    It now existsin nearly every allotment and in many gardens from Carlisleto Birmingham and throughout the greater part of Wales.The chief centres of infection, however, are South Lancashire(where practically every farm as well as every garden andallotment is affected),  Staffordshire and the industrialdistricts in North and South Wales.   It is so prevalent inthe Swansea,  Rhondda,  Aberdale and Rhymney Valleys that outof the many thousands of allotments cultivated, there a^s few,if any,  which are not  more or less affected.   It is to befeared that the crop in many of thes6 districts will be acomplete failure, and will result in the loss of many thousandtons of potatoes;  and that if appropriate measures are nottaken there will be a great extension of the disease in thecourse of the next year or two*          It is impossible with the present reduced staff todeal adequately with all known cases of this disease,  or toprevent the infection spreading..    The matt or, however,  isengaging the serious attention of the heads of the DepartmentcEvery possible effort  will be made to deal with the seriousposition which has now become evident.   Very little,  however,can be done to save infected crops this year,  and the onlypossible remedy for next season would appear to be to obtaincontrol of the stocks of certain varieties which are knownto be immune to the disease even when planted on infectedland and to enforce their distribution for seed.   No sprayingmeasures possess any value.                     SMALL HOLDINGS COLONY.          At the Crown Colony,  Patrington,  the  building ofcottages is proceeding,  five of them being  now  occupied.Minor alterations to existing buildings are  being carried outand work on the new road is in  progress.   101  men have beenemployed during the past week.    On the farms four moresoldiers have been found employment and a National Serviceman has arrived for tractor work.   8 horses ara  standing idleowing to the impossibility of obtaining men  capable ofworking them.   Haymaking is in full swing.   One of theagisted cattle has died of anthrax.   The carcase has beenduly burnt and the field isolated.          The motor tractors are a  constant  source of trouble,work being stopped from time to time by minor breakdowns.          At Holboach tho building  of cottages  is proceedingsatisfactorily.
          An estate,  1150 acres in extent,  situate in theparish of Sheriff Hales in the county of Shropshire has &quot;beenacquired with possession at March 25th 1918 as the site ofthe 3rd English Colony, at the moderate figure of  40,000.The property, which forms part of the Duke  of Sutherland&apos;sLilleshall Estate comprises 6 farms with commodious housesand buildings and 45 cottages all in:-a ring fence.   The soilis productive and at the same time easily worked,  thus beingvery suitable for small holding purposes.   Rather more thanone third of the land is under grass.                    FISHERIES DIVISION.                                     ve Wbrk.          The scheme for the insurance of smaller craft asagainst War Risks is proving very successful *    It is hopedto arrange for a similar insurance in the ease of Belgian andIcelandic Boats which would result in an appreciable increasein fish landed.          Arrangements whereby at least 20 Belgian boats mayfish from Lowestoft are nearing completion, but the matter isaffected by the claim of the Inland Revenue Authorities totax Belgian boats under the Belgian Flag in respect ofprofits earned outside British territorial waters.    TheBoard are endeavouring to effect a settlement,  otherwise theBelgian fishing fleet will go to French ports,  which theycan use as bases free from any taxation.          The complaints of pollution of fisheries by aciddischarged from nitre cake dumps from Munition Works havecaused experiments to be made with a view to ascertainingwhat proportion of acid in Sea or fresh water  is fatal tofish life.   This brings the woi-k within the application ofthe Vivisection Acts and the Board have this week appliedfor a licence in respect of their works and officer Incharge at Conway^   :              Freshwater Fish Committee..          The Committee are about to submit their preliminaryReport.   Special attention has been paid to the developmentof &quot;the eel fisheries and important investigations andexperiments in connection with those fisheries  are inprogress.          A set of recipes for cooking freshwater fish hasbeen prepared and is about to be printed and issued to thepublic gratuitously as one of the Board&apos;s Fishery Leaflets.-                  Si2^Z o cL Cpj^ittee. *          The activities of the Fish Food Committee continue.Their main function is to lubricate the wheels  of distribution,and to secure that fish shall not go to waste  from lack ofthefacilities for distribution.          Instances of their activities in this direction,as at present in operation,  are the following
!     (l)  Two members of their staff are at work in the Weymouthaxea, watching the landings of mackerel which now at thisperiod of the year come in in large gluts and are frequentlywasted for want of a market,  or not caught because the buyersring depresses prices to so low a level that the fishermen willnot fish;  and by their presence there, with the knowledge thatthey are ready to buy if necessary, have stimulated the market,and therefore have stimulated the fishing.   Unfortunately3 thefishing has fallen off, and the season so far must be reckoned abad one, but all fish that has come ashore has been successfullymarketed.   Arrangements have also been made for assisting thefishermen at Aldeborough and elsewhere where transport and marketfacilities are inadequate.     (2)  Much attention has been given to the question of thesupply of boxes for packing fish,   In view of the shortage oftimber serious difficulties have arisen,,   The Committee, however,are working out a scheme for making use of the boxes in whichfrozen fish is brought from Canada for the Canadian and Britishtroops.   These boxes will require a certain amount of conversionand adaptation for home use, but the Committee hope to get overthese difficulties *   They have been successful also in securinga considerable stock of boxes from the Maypole Dairy Company andother sources, and these boxes have been distributed where theneed arose,     (3)  The Committee keep constant touch with the RailwayCompanies with regard to transport facilities for fish by rail,and negotiations with the Railway Companies have been attended withgood results.   In particular, during the past week they havesucceeded in sscuring a special fish train from North Shields forLondon3 with connections to all the principal midland towns, todeal with the heavy landings of herrings which have recently beenbrought in to North Shields,   They have also secured batterfacilities for the transport of fish from Scottish ports to Englishcentres 0     (4)  Arrangements have also been made with the Army CanteenCommittee so that, in the case of the arrival of large gluts  offish at North Shields, ths camps in the neighbourhood may oaH atNorth  Shields to obtain their own supplies direct from the port.     (5)  Constant interviews have taken place between theSecretary of the Committee and the Priority Branch of the Ministryof Munitions with regard to the distribution of tin-plates forfish canning purposes, to which further reference is made below,     (6)  The Committee have also been endeavouring to organisethe emergiGs of amateur anglers in the interests of the generalfish supply, the object being to secure the greatest possibleoutput of fish from this source , and at the same time to preventthe waste of man-power and petrol by mere pleasure boating.          Incidentally, innumerable questions of minor importanceare also being dealt with by the Committee.                             Motor Loan Committee,.          The installations of motors in fishing vessels is now,so far as conditions as regards motor labours  delivery of engines,etc. permits, oin full swing,   As the result of the  Committee*soperations there is an actual increase of 27 in the number offishing vessels fishing under motor power.   These vessels rangefrom 18 to 48 feet in length, the majority being between 25 and 35.
Q0Ebcperienca shows that the Board&apos;s calculations as to the.increase of output which might be anticipated from theinstallation of motor power certainly are not excessive.          Another 28 motor engines are in process ofinstallation, and the demand for engines from most parts ofthe coast is far beyond the Committee*s capacity to supplyin existing circumstances.   Among the recent applicationsis one for a motor engine for a sailing trawler of 120 tonsdisplacement .          The main difficulties which the Committee have tocontend with are the Jra&amp;equacy of the output of engines,especially of the smaller sizes, and the difficulty inobtaining the requisite labour, especially through thedepletion oftthe staffs of the smaller shipwrights andengineers on the coast by demands for military service.          In certain quarters also the Committee&apos;s operationshavetbeen obstructed by Local Sea Fisheries  Committees, whohave not been able to appreciate the importance of the homeproduction of food supplies, and have declined to relax theenforcement of byelaws restrictive of fishing operations-&apos;&apos;which would render the installation of motor power to agreat extent nugatory.   The Board have accordingly appliedto the Ministry of Food for an Order enabling them,  asthe necessity arises, to make Orders over-riding localbyelaws.          In addition to the installation actual andprospective referred to above, provision is being made forthe installation of motors in 8 sailing trawlers, 4 of whichwill work out of Padstow and 4 out of Brixham,  which willsubsequently be armed with guns by the Admiralty.   Theprincipal object of the motor in these cases is to give thevessels the necessary mobility to enable them to use theirguns successfully.   The vessels will fish with fleets ofunarmed vessels, with a view to giving them protection inthe case of attack, and at the same time preserving theirown food producing value so long as the vessels are notmolested, and at the same time enabling vessels whichotherwise would have to be kept in port,, to prosecute theirfishing.   The motors in this case,  it will be  observed,serve the double purpose and make a proportionately increasedcontribution to the fish food supply.            Tin Plates for Canning Fish.          A very difficult situation has arisen in connectionwith the supply of tin plates for canning fish.   Canning isby far the most permanent form of cure to which fish can beput,  and the most suitable from the point of view of homeconsumption, as well as Army requirements.    Unfortunately,the supply of tin-plates falls very far short of the totaldemand,  and the Board have been making strenuous efforts tosecure a greater proportion for the home canners wlio dealwith surplus fish which is liable to go to  waste - and issubject to be sent to the manura works -  unless it  can bepromptly handled by canners.   The supply of tin-rplates isrequired more especially in connection with the herringfisheries now in progress;  the pilchard fisheries,  alsonow in progress but generally reaching their height  in theautumn;   the sprat fisheries,  which commence about thebeginning of November, and the Mackerel fisheries which are
-la progress.   All these are glut fisheries3 and it is most important  from the point of view of tho conservation of home supplies and the creation of a food-reserve, that tin-plates should &quot;be  available for dealing with them.   The question has been tho subject of frequent interviews between the Secretary  of the Fish Pood Committee and the Priority Branch of the Ministry of Munitions, and also between the Assistant Secretary  of the Board, on the one side and the Ministry of Pood, the  Director of Army Supplies, the Ministry of Munitions and other  Departments, and suggestions have been made to the Foreign Office in favour of the diversion for home use of a  certain proportion of tin-plates at present exported to Norway.               The Importation of Frozen Pish.           A scheme is under consideration for increasing the food supplies and at the same time economising food, by the diversion of a certain amount of tonnage at present used to carry frozen meat to the transportation of frozen fish from  Canada and Newfoundland to this country.   Various inquiries  are in progress as to the possibility of this scheme.                   tickled Herrings.                   nesmmmu i - i m mm mmmmm www m m mm ii -           On July 25th the Assistant Secretary addressed the Grocers&apos; Federation at their Conference at Portsmouth, with a  view to  enlisting their assistance in the distribution of pickled herrings during the Autumn and Winter,  as a cheap substitute for meat.   It is considered desirable to work through Grocers as well as Fishmongers so - that this commodity may be distributed as widely a3 possible.   In this matter the Assistant Secretary is acting on behalf of the Cured Fish  Committee of the Ministry of Food.27th July, 1917.
