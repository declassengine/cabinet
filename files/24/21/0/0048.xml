 gj C ri, E T.                                                      X / 5.?. 1647.             WAR  C hUET.                 M E S 0 f 01 A M I A  fe A M P A  I  G H.  .                  (  No &quot;be by General Smuts).         Ropeatod warnings have reached Us recently  that  the Germans are organising a groat offensive  gainst Bagdad for next Autumn.   These warnings ere so continuous and circumstantial that proper weight should he attached to them.   The last rumour,&apos; brought by the Greek liiniatei1 from Oonsii-Jitinople, is that all Mdsh troops on the Galicia Dobrudja and Macedonian Fronts are being despatched to  Bagdad for this offensive, which.is controlled by Falkenhayn.   In  view of our inactivity;at Salonica and the- Russian collapse,  the Turks mey be induced to romove. reserve  . divisions from Thrace to this distant theatre for a great blow.  - - In view,  further,  of the Russian situation in Armenia they may be expected  to  reinforce their Bagdad Front from that quartor1.  Their&quot;&apos; main difficulty in these troop movements would be transport but they may  make  a great effort to overcome this difficulty.  -         General Maude has been ver^ oonfident of his ability to. hold his  own at Bagdad.    At the same  time  the whole Bagdad Front- requires  the most  careful consideration of  the Government. :Should Kaude unexpectedly get into trouble it would  be most difficult to relieve him  by way of. Basra,  and the situation in Mesopotamia may onoe more become serious.    In suoh a case  General Allenby^s pressure  at  Gaza will not help him much until his advance: reaches &quot; the vicinity of Jerusalem,  Yvhich may not take place before the Winter.   The  soundest strategic move  for the relief of  Llaude  willte the severance of  all  Turkish. Eastern, communications near Alexandretta,  but  this  scheme,, because of its  magnitude, neitherthe Military nor the  Naval ruthorities, appear  willing to considerfavourably.         I do  not  mean to  convey that  the possibility of a second

The Wcr Cabinet is at present  not  fully &amp;u fait with the  Mesopotamia  situation and should  have an  opportunity  to consider the whole  subject before  the Allied  Conference is resumed  next. week.    I would therefore suggest that  a full Memorandum on the subject be prepared by  the  General Staff for  our  early consideration.    This Memorandum should deal not only with Haude&apos;s. present  and prospective strength to  hold out at Bagdad  or further back, and  to protect hi3 communications, but  also with the probable forces thot the  enemy  could assemble against him  in view of  the difficult  Turkish communications in that area.   A full  consideration  of the subject might influence the Cabinet in coming to a  decision on  the  questions of the withdrawl of our forces in whole or in pert from Salonica and might load to a closer examination of the ^lexandrettaproject as the best means of a sudden coup in relief of Maude in case of a grave situation threatening next Autumn or Winterat Bagdad.
