The quantity dischargedin November last was at the rate of about 110,000 to 120,000 tonsper week, while it is now about 250,000 tons a week.   Variousmatters are however, still unsatisfactory,  and are being enquiredinto.Mesopotamiabeen far from satisfactory within the last few weeks.    This ispossibly due to climatic causes.   A Representative  of  thisMinistry is now on his way out to Mesopotamia to  enquire personallyinto the conditions prevailing at Basra.   In the meantime theDepartment has withdrawn certain ships, which owingto the congestion prevailing, could not be properly  utilised.United Kingdomthere is considerable detention of ships in consequence.

 by Convoy,  referred to in my letter of the 21st instant, result in bringing a number of ships into a port simultaneously, and thus contribute  to the congestion.   This however is not an unmixed evil,  as  it haB  the effect of holding a certain proportion of ships in reserve  pending the further development of Admiralty arrangements for the protection of shipping; on the North Atlantic route.   The urgent need for  providing additional grain storage has been pressed upon the  Wheat Commission,                  Tonnage Purchased in Japan.         The first two Steamers acquired by this department in Japan  through Messrs. Furness Withy and Company, (s.s,uWAR KING-&quot; and &quot;WAR  QUEEN&quot;)  have arrived safely, bringing 20,000 tons of Australian  wheat.   The deliveries of these Steamers were well in advance of  the contract date.                     Coal for Italy.         Italy is getting about 400,000 tons of coal this month but a much larger quantity is required.   At meetings held this week, it was arranged to  endeavour to provide an increase by sending snips for the East by  the Mediterranean route, instead of via the Cape, beginning with the last week of August.   The Admiralty are now considering the  steps to be taken to provide the necessary protection Tor the ships.                         Ore         Supplies of ore have been well maintained during this months                     Sugar and Wheat         The quantity of sugar now being brought in is  larger thanhad been  anticipated, and it is still hoped that the IS weeks stock of wheat  aimed at may be realised.                              I am,                                      Sir,                              Your obedient Hervant,                                (UGD.) John Anderson,
