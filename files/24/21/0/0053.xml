WAR CiBII^I.. p. 1552*--              IIBSO   I 3 t A O.            memorandum by the Ite;guty Chief of the Naval Staffs            (Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 195, Minute 9).        fieno, or Faeno, Island is situated in the narrow part of the  little Belt; it ie If miles long and \ a mile wide, and is separated  from Jutland by a Channel \ mile wida and from the large Danish  island of Pyeh by a channel \ of a mile v/ide.        She boundary between German Sehleswig and Danish Jutland is 7  miles south of Fieno Island, and the navigation of the little Belt is  very intrioate at the southern end: the navigable channel can be  commanded by gunfire from the German side at very easy range,        She Danes do not propose to defend Jutland or Fyen Island, and  even if they did so, it would be very difficult to prevent German  forces invading Fyen Island, owing to the artillery at the disposal of  the Germans to dominate Fyen Island and cover a crossing and the  numerous points where landings could be effected,  Fieno Island does  not, therefore, appear to be of any strategic importance.(Intd.)
