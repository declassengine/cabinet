Officers should come in too - additional cost.            People are apt to speak of a soldier&apos;s pay, as ifit were all that the State gave him.            The value of the worst paid soldier (i.e. l/s aday man) of what the State gives to, or in respect of, him maybe calculated at from 30/6 to  5 a week.As follows :-                                               /            A single man without dependants -              Pay..........7/- to 10/6 a week              Clothing. , ... . . .    3/6              Board, lodging I/fed. etc.20/-                                      Wo&quot;  to  34/-            han with wife and two children              Pay..........  7/-  to  10/6              Separation allowance               (state proportion) . . 17/6  to  21/-              Clo thing.......  3/6       3/6              Board, lodging, Med &amp;c 25/6      25/6              Civil Liabs. Cttee                grant   .......     up to 40/-                                      53/6  to  90/-            Attention is drawn to the fact that the single manwith no dependants gets his pay in full as pocket money,whereas the man with dependants has to make an allotment tosecure a separation allowance.            The fact that a single man &quot;without encumbrances&quot;is better off than a family man is not unknown in civil life.            Proficiency pay, given to married and unmarriedalike would not obviate this.   And the question really is oneof pocket monejr.Is
          Is it worth  140,000,000 ?          Colonial rates of pay are as follows t-Australian       6/- a day - l/- deferred,   ITo separation                                              allowance.New Zealanders.  5/- (lA deferred.  Ho separation allowance.                     (2/- to family.Canadian.        4/6.   $0% deferred to family.  Separation                                       allowance as well.S. African.      3/-  1/6 compulsory allotment.   Separation                                       allowance as well.          In Canada and S. Africa the State contribution  toseparation allowance is rather higher than here.          It must be remembered that the Navy would probablybe involved too.          If anything has to be done I think the best planwould be to guarantee that every soldier shall get a minimumof say 5/- a week for himself.   This means that the Statewould pay part of the allotment of those who are the worst off.31st July,  1917,DERBY.
