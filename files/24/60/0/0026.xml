No, 163Confidential.[mLLIEB MARITIME TRANSPORT COUNCIL.Report of Action April 16th to July 15th 1918.A Report of Action up to April 15th 1918 was submitted to the Council at its last meeting in Paris on April 23rd to 25th.Since that date no meeting of the Council has been held. The permanent organisation has been continuing its work both in giving executive effect to the Councils decisions at the last meeting and also in pursuance of the general duty of assisting in the allocation and most advantageous use of Allied tonnage by co-operative action. In practice it has been found possible to continue this work without decisions of such difficulty and importance as to necessitate the meeting of the Council itself in formal session. The place of a formal meeting has, however, been largely met by frequent communication with the several Ministers,, The permanent organisation has been in close touch with the British Ministers and Mr. Stevens in London; while M. Monnet and also Sir Joseph Maclay and myself have visited the French Ministers in Paris and Professor Attolico has consulted the Italian Ministers in Rome. In addition, in order to maintain closer relations with the American Government, Mr. Stevens arranged that Mr. Rublee and Mr. Morrow should go to Washington particularly in relation to the formation of the Programme Committees. The contact with the respective Governments has therefore in practice been maintained without a formal meeting of the Council. Tentative arrangements were made for such a meeting both towards the end of June and at the end of July, but the situation in France rendered it difficult for the respective Ministers to meet, and in view of the progress of the work as indicated below, it was decided that the necessity for a formal meeting was not such as to justify the different Ministers leaving their respective countries in the especially difficult circumstances of the period.In view of the time that has elapsed, however, Ministers will probably desire to be informed in some detail of the actual work that has been done, and for this purpose the following report has been prepared.Summary and Index of Report......--  page 2Lancaster House, July 16th 1918.J.

America and Great Britain shared the responsibility for shipping about 26 emergency cargoes mainly from America, 10,000 tons of flour shipped from Great Britain, and about 12,000 tons rice and miscellaneous stores are being arranged.Permanent Arrangeme?its. It has been agreed to give Belgian Relief the first call on the Swedish war-zone tonnage.These arrangements should meet the Belgian Relief necessities adequately.5. special allocations of tonnage among allies.(a) In April. May and June 288,000 tons of cereals have been diverted to France and 457,000 tons to Italy in accordance with the procedure arranged to give effect to the 3rd November Agreement.(b) Arrangements have been made to increase the British Liner Service to Italy by about 150,000 tons dead weight, and to make about 75,000 tons dead weight of Italian vessels in the cereal programme available for imports from America, the effect of these arrangements being to increase Italian imports from America by about 75,000 tons a month.(c) The shipment to France of about 47,000 tons of nitrates and about 55,000 tons railway wagons and miscellaneous stores has been arranged for July and August.(d) In April, May, and June 637,879 American soldiers were embarked, 330,956 being in British vessels.6. allocation of pooled neutral vessels.124 vessels have been allotted between the Allies under the arrangements of the Council.

(The system of furnishing these particulars is!described.in Appendix 1 of this report.) The Committees figures were therefore not available for the first month to the&apos;14th April, or for the first half of the second month to the 14th May, and in these circumstances it has been agreed by the French and Italian representatives in Loud in that the method of computation previously adopted in relation to the Italian coal supply should be continued for the period up to the 14th May, and the figures shown in the table have been accepted as fairly representing the situation over the whole period of lour months.It will be seen that in the months to 14th April and 14th May the Councils total of 600,000 tons a mouth was reached, because the shipments of British coal were considerably in excess of the amount of 250,000 tons a month agreed upon to be furnished under the original programme. This excess counterbalanced in these months the deficiency in French coal under that programme, this deficiency being primarily due to shortage of railway wagons, which reduced the supply of French coal from the 350,000 tons contemplated in the programme to about 225,000 tons a month. Difficulty was also experienced in securing coasting tonnage for conveyance of coal from the French Mediterranean ports. As will be seen, the shortage so caused was met by the allocation of extra shipping to increase the quantity sent from the United Kingdom by the long sea route from 150,000 to about 235,000 tons a month, the quantity of British coal shipped via Blare being maintained at a figure considerably above 100,000 tons a month. It may be observed that these extra shipments of British coal could only be arranged at a considerable diversion of British liner tonnage to carry coal to the Mediterranean before proceeding across the Atlantic.During the following month, May 15th to June 14th, there was a shortage of rather more than 100,000 tons on the total Italian requirement, although the shipments of British coal were not short of the agreed proportion. There was sufficient tonnage -to maintain the totals of the previous two months, and the failure to do so was due to the difficulty in securing the necessary coal, the output of which in British mines had been diminished by the effect of a &quot; combing out &quot; of miners for military service and by other difficulties.During the following month, June 15th to July 14th, some 14,000 tons of the arrears were made up, and it is hoped that it will be found possible to make up the balance of the arrears during the current month ending 14th August.In addition to the normal requirement of 600,000 tons a month, Signor Bianchi, at the last session of the Council, referred to the necessity of establishing a military strategic reserve of coal in Italy. It was finally arranged, in June, that a military reserve of this character, to be additional to the normal supply, and to be kept entirely separate from that supply, should be formed up to the amount of 150,000 tons, and that, if possible, this quantity should be shipped during the six weeks to the end of July. Up to the 14th July Great Britain had shipped or allocated 115,000 tons of this strategic reserve, leaving a balance of 35,000 tons to be allocated to be shipped.a 2Detailed Report.1. -Meeting of the Council at Paris, April 23rd to 25th.Draft minutes of the Meeting of the Council at its Second Session (April 23rd to 25th) were prepared and circulated to the respective Governments shortly after the meeting of the Council.2. Italian Coal.The programme of the normal supply of coal to Italy amounting to 600,000 tons a month, which was approved by the Council at its First Session on 15th March, was continued by decision of the Council on 23rd April.The following table furnishes details of the coal actually supplied to Italy in accordance with these decisions, by months : 
3. French Goal.The normal requirements of France for imported coal have been increased by two factors, (a) the necessity of replacing the French coal sent to Italy as part of the Italian programme, and (6) the reduction in the output of the Pas de Calais coalfields and in the quantity railed from those coalfields to south of the Somme as a result of the German offensive.The Franco-British Committee examined this question fully in Paris on April 23rd, and its detailed report is included as Appendix 15 in the Draft Minutes of the Council. Its main recommendation was to the effect that on the assumption that 100,000 tons of coal could continue to be railed from the Pas de Calais coalfields to south of the Somme each month, and on the further assumption that French coal sent to Italy was fully replaced, France would still require an additional importation of 360,000 tons a month of British coal, towards which quantity could be counted any British coal which could be diverted to ports west and south of the Somme from the supplies hitherto sent to Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne.This recommendation was referred by the Council to the permanent organisation to consider the possibility of arranging the necessary tonnage.So far as tonnage could meet the situation it has, in fact, been fully provided, and it is important that it should be clearly realised that since the date of the first German offensive in March, sufficient shipping has been provided to lift every ton of coal that could be provided from the United Kingdom and received by the French ports. But, unfortunately, the supplies to France have fallen very seriously short of the total programme to an extent of not less than about 935,000 tons since April 1st through the following causes : (a) The limitations of the French ports, and(b) The difficulty of obtaining coal in England from the English mines.The first of these causes, i.e., the capacity of the French ports to receive the coal, has, in fact, been the limiting factor, and it may be generally stated that whatever ships and whatever coal had been allotted to the French coal service, France would not have been able to receive more coal than she has, because she has been kept continuously supplied with the amount of coal and tonnage which she could handle at her ports. The difficulty at the ports has itself arisen mainly from the shortage of wagons and the dislocation of their distribution resulting from the movements of troops and supplies in connection with the recent operations, and to some extent also from the dislocation of inland water transport by barges, resulting from the same operations. There has at the same time, however, been very great difficulty in securing the amount of coal from British mines, chiefly through the effect of the process of combing out miners for military service, which is worst in the initial stages of the process, and sufficient coal to keep the French ports fully fed has only been obtained by diverting supplies to some extent from neutrals and also on some occasions by the supply of coal which was not of the first quality. In effect, however, the shortage of output of coal has only affected France hitherto in making a com-paratively small proportion of the supply of inferior quality, because, serious as the shortage of output has been, the limiting factor of France&apos;s total supplies has been the capacity of her ports to receive the coal. The actual figures of supply are as follows : 	April.	May.	June.	Total.Programme      -      -	-   Tons. 1,740.000 1,495,000	Tons. 1,740,000 1,530,000	Tons. 1,740,000 1,260,000	Ions. 5,220,000 4,285,000	245,000	210,000	430,000	935,000The gravity of the situation disclosed by these figures needs no emphasis. There is hope that the capacity of the ports will now improve and the current monthly-import increase, but no hope can, of course.,be offered that the arrears of the past can be made up.
4. Belgian Relief.The Council decided at its meeting in April that the requirements of Belgian Relief should be included in the programme of the Wheat Executive with the consent of that body and should be given the priority promised to them in December .1917, and instructed the permanent organisation of the Council to arrange with the associated Governments for the provision of such supplementary tonnage as may be required to give effect to this decision.The Wheat Executive accepted the responsibility thus proposed on condition that (a) they should have the right to scrutinise the programme, and also (b) that the necessary further tonnage was duly provided, no alterations being made in the arrangements previously in force as to the supply of articles other than cereals in the Relief programme. The first condition (a) did not prove to present practical difficulty, as on scrutiny the Wheat Executive felt able to accept the quantities included in the Relief programme. The provision of tonnage presented very great difficulties, which have, however, been ultimately overcome successfully.It was agreed that the permanent solution of the problem of providing supple-mentary assistance was undoubtedly to be found in the allocation of neutral non-war- v zone vessels, as such vessels would both be safer from interference from the Germans and also involve less loss to the Allied cause than war-zone vessels. In accordance with these principles it was agreed that Belgian Relief ought to have the first call upon the non-war-zone tonnage (amounting to a little under 200,000 tons d.w.) which was to be obtained under the Swedish Tonnage Agreement.As this Tonnage Agreement had not, however, been completed in April and the tonnage forthcoming under it could only in any event be obtained gradually, a further problem of immediate supply arose.It was estimated that before the Swedish tonnage could meet the situation fully it would probably be necessary to ship about 26 additional cargoes beyond what the Belgian Relief vessels could themselves convey, towards which about 10 were expected to be carried by occasional charterings of Swedish or other neutral vessels. Ultimately the following two proposals were made, and accepted by the American and British Governments: (1) That in the intermediate period America and Great Britain should each be responsible for transporting eight cargoes, and (2) that these two Governments should agree to meeting the problem permanently by giving Belgian Relief the first call upon the Swedish non-war-zone tonnage.In practice these arrangements had to be supplemented by the following further action: (a) Great Britain undertook to transport 10,000 tons of flour from England to Rotterdam. Nearly 9,000 tons have already been shipped, and the balance will be shipped very shortly.(6) Great Britain also agreed to transport from the United Kingdom to Rotterdam certain quantities of beans and peas, herrings, clothing, and miscellaneous articles amounting to some 12,000 tons, and 2,000 tons of rice, at present held by the Belgian Relief in the United Kingdom. The vessels that have been engaged in the carriage of the flour will be continued on the &apos; service for the transport of these further commodities, the shipment of which will be commenced immediately.This action, however, was taken on the distinct understanding that it was only to meet a particular emergency and that in future supplies must be imported direct, and not via the United Kingdom, with the resultant extra strain on tonnage and extra risk. The Swedish Agreement having been subsequently concluded, the application of the policy assented to by the Governments concerned should meet the needs of Belgian Relief in future.It should be added that the Belgian Government visited London in connection with the problem and that the progress of the business was expedited in London by the formation of a small Committee under General Smuts representing the British War Cabinet and in America by the direct interest both of President Wilson and of Mr. Hoover.5. Changes in Allocation of Tonnage as between the Allies.The following are the most important steps taken either through the Tonnage Committee and the Council or through the officials in the different national shipping
	April.	May.	June.	Total.France   -     -     -     -     -	Tons. 109,000 92,000	Tons. 75,000 207,000	Ions. 104,000 158,000	Tons. 288,000 457,000	201,000	282,000	262,000	745,000These quantities are diversions and do not include the quantities of cereals supplied in British ships previously time chartered to France or Italy.(6) Allocations to Italy. In addition to the allotments for coal (explained in paragraph 2) and for cereals as stated above, the following special arrangements have been made: (i) Great Britain has agreed to increase her liner service (see (d) below) runningto Italy with a view to shipping 50,000 tons a month of cargo (other than cereals) from the United States to Italy per month, and,(ii) In addition she has consented to the withdrawal of 75,000 tons d.w. of Italiantonnage from the cereal programme, which Avill increase correspondingly the amount of British tonnage requiring to be diverted to Italy in accordance with the wheat arrangements described in (a) above.(iii) In addition special shipments amounting to 70,000 tons of munitions, &amp;c, havebeen made from the ILK.The allocation of this extra tonnage was, however, conditional upon the loading facilities at both ends being sufficient to handle the ships. In view of the reports as to congestion at Italian ports, particularly Genoa, it appears very doubtful whether the extra amount of imports contemplated can be received in the near future.(c) France. At the last meeting of the Council France asked for special assistance for the shipment over three months of the following articles from America :-Locomotives and railway wagons   - 50,000 tons per month.Nitrates -     -     - - .   -     -     -     - 15,000Barbed wire -     -     -     -     - 15,000     ,,       ,,Powder and explosives..... 5,000     ,, ,,85,000On examination the full quantities of railway wagons and locomotives did not prove to.be available for immediate shipment, and the required rearrangement of tonnage could only be gradually effected.The transport for nitrates requested has been arranged, approximately 47,000 tons having been diverted or arranged in British ships by July 15th. For the remainder a modified request for 100,000 tons of railway wagons and war material was made in June in substitution of the original estimate, and of this quantity about 33,000 tons have now been shipped with a further prospect of about 20,000 tons in August,A further request was received for the shipment of 150,000 tons of oil seeds, but no considerable progress can be made with this until an examination by the Programme Committee.(d) With a view to meeting these extra demands for shipment from France and Italy, and to facilitate the shipments of wheat in accordance with a necessarily varying programme, it has been arranged that the number of British liners going to France and Italy should be largely increased. Details of the reasons for this action and of the extent of the services are given in Appendix 2.organisations in London in pursuance of the general purpose of the Council to secure * the most advantageous allocation and use of Allied tonnage by co-operative action :-(a) Under the agreement of 3rd November 1917, and as subsequently modified and supplemented, Great Britain has in practice accepted responsibility for supple-menting deficiencies in tonnage required for transporting to France and Italy their agreed shares in the cereals programme.The quantities of cereals so supplied in British tonnage to France and Italy in the -three months now in question were approximately as follows : 
(e) The increase in the number of American troops asked for by the Supreme War Council and agreed to by the American Government has resulted in an extensive reallocation of shipping. The numbers of American troops actually embarked in British ships as compared with the total embarked during the last three months have been as follows:-		April.	May.	June.		Embarked in British ships Total embarkation   *      -      -	50,084 117,212	135,662 244,235	145,210 276,372	The greater part of the remainder were embarked in American vessels, certain assistance being also rendered by French and Italian vessels.(/) A continuous and detailed joint examination of vessels on different Allied Services has been in progress, and a considerable number of reallocations, amounting to about 80, have been made as a consequence.6. Allocation of Pooled Tonnage.Under the agreement reported at the last meeting of the Council and printed as Appendix 21 in the Minutes, future time-charters of neutral vessels were to be employed during the period of the war under the directions of the Council.This agreement imposed a direct executive duty upon the permanent organisation of controlling the employment of a large block of tonnage under Allied control. This tonnage is estimated to amount ultimately to about 750,000 tons dead weight. The scheme comes gradually into operation, but 124 vessels have already been dealt with under the general directions of the permanent organisation, which agreed upon the following provisional working plan : 1. Vessels up to 1,700 tons dead  French coal trade, weight.2. Vessels between 1,700 and 3,000   Coal to Bay, returning with ore under thetons dead weight. ordinary principles.3. Vessels between 3,000 and 4,500   Coal to Italy, returning with ore undertons dead weight. ordinary principles.4. Vessels   over  4,500 tons dead   Coal to Italy, then to Wheat Executive toweight. load in America for the Allies.The reasons for devising a plan of this character rather than attempting to decide the employment of each vessel as it was chartered in relation to the require-ments of the Allies at the time, are stated in detail in Appendix 3. The principles indicated in that Appendix have been agreed upon provisionally, though it is recognised that when the programmes of requirements have been approximately agreed it will probably be convenient to use this pool of tonnage as an adjusting-factor over a wider range of services.7. Other Tonnage Arrangements.(i) Franco-Brazilian Agreement: Employment of Enemy Vessels.The United States Government has put forward a proposal for the co-operative use of the 30 ex-German vessels covered, by the Franco-Brazilian agreement. This proposal contemplates the use of this tonnage on the following triangular route : (1) Coal, United Kingdom to Brazil.(2) Coffee, manganese, and other commodities, Brazil to United States, America.(3) War exports, United States, America, to France.In this way the voyage in ballast across the Atlantic is avoided and a proportion of the. United States tonnage operating between the United States, America, and Brazil will be released for transatlantic work.The proposal, which has been carefully discussed by the Tonnage Committee, has been received sympathetically by the French Government, and as far as practicable has been put into operation.(ii) Use of Refrigerator Space in the North Atlantic.In order to transport American troops to France it has been necessary to divert a large number of British passenger-carrying vessels to the North Atlantic, and in spite of the fact that insulated vessels in the North Atlantic not suitable for trooping purposes have been diverted to-other trades, there yet remains a considerable surplusA 4
of refrigerator space on the troop-carryirig vessels which the available supply of meat in North America is not sufficient to fill.An analysis of the figures shows an excess of about 40,000 tons a month of refrigerator space as against the meat available for shipment.At the same time the United States Government are insulating for operation in the North Atlantic more troop-carrying tonnage, which will be capable of lifting another 20,000 tons of meat a month. With a viewr to making the best use of this space proposals have been made to the United States Shipping Board that American army meat requirements should be carried in the available balance of insulated space on the British troop-carrying vessels,, while the United States non-trooping refrigerator tonnage should, as far as suitable, be employed between the Plate and France and Italy,This proposal is under consideration by the United States Government.(iii) French Liners for Trooping Purposes.As a result of the negotiations by the British Government arrangements have now been made wrhereby the French Government are putting a number of large passenger vessels into the American trooping programme. These vessels carry American troops to their maximum capacity on a passenger schedule rate, and the scale of rates is now being arranged between the American and French authorities ; whatever space is left in the holds will be used for food cargoes to France.(iv) Revised arrangements for bunkering tonnage operating in North Atlantic on- French account.x4rising out of the examination of the French tonnage, it was found that France had a number of small vessels operating in the Atlantic unsuited to that trade, and that at the same time larger Atlantic vessels were to a considerable extent under the necessity to bunker in South Wales.In these circumstances it has been proposed that it would be an economy of tonnage if the above-mentioned small vessels were withdrawn from the Atlantic service and formed into a bunkering fleet for the other Atlantic vessels, which would thus be relieved in a considerable measure from the necessity of coming to the United Kingdom to bunker.The French Government have agreed to this proposal subject to the vessels  eleven in number -being normally free from the obligation to bring back ore to this country. An understanding has, however, been arrived at between the two countries whereby this exemption from ore obligation is interpreted as meaning that the vessel shall have priority in returning from the Bay in ballast, but that if, after taking into account all available tonnage for bringing back ore to the United Kingdom from North Spain, there is at any time a shortage of tonnage for this purpose, the French Government agree that these vessels shall load ore. In such cases account will be taken of the amount of coal lost to France by reason of this deviation, and Great Britain will make good such loss of coal by carrying an equivalent amount of bunker coal on British vessels to a French Atlantic port,8. Formation of Programme Committees and other Action to secure Revision of Import Programmes.The Council recommended the following action at its last session ; (a) The formation of Allied Committees to adjust all Allied Programmes ofImports ;(b) The examination of vessels engaged in Colonial Service;(c) The examination of the Allied Military Supply Programmes ; and(d) The examination by the Allied Naval Authorities of the demands made bythe Allied Navies on Mercantile tonnage,Special notes as to action under (6), (c), and (d) are included in Appendices 4, 5, and 6. It will be well, however, to state here in some detail the action taken with regard to the formation of Programme Committees,The CounciFs recommendations as to the formation of these Committees have been accepted by the French, Italian, and British Governments,The American Delegate on the Council has been in, communication with his Government with a view to a similar acceptance by that Government and the appointment of the necessary members. In view of the importance of the principles involved the American Government desired to give close consideration to the question
before making appointments, and one of the objects of Mr. Roublee&apos;s visit to America was to discuss the matter with the American Authorities. Though no formal decision has yet been received, the latest information justifies a hope that America will appoint full members of the different Programme Committees in the same way as the other Allied Governments in accordance with the recommendation of the Council.In the meantime steps have been taken to secure the formation of the different Committees, arrangements being made for American representatives to be associated informally with different Committees pending a final decision of the American Government.The British Government, in agreeing - to the formation of the Committees, allocated the responsibility for appointing the British representatives, and in general making the arrangements on the British side, to the Departments respectively responsible for controlling the several, commodities. In accordance with this principle the British War Office became responsible with regard to wool; Q.M.G. Stores horses and mules, hides and leather, flax, hemp and jute ; the Ministry of Munitions for munitions, &amp;c. ; the Board of Trade for cotton, paper, tobacco, timber and miscel-laneous commodities, and, jointly with the Ministry of Shipping, for coal and coke; the Ministry of Food for the several articles of food, including cereals, meat and fats, oil seeds and sugar.The following Committees have now been formed, or are in course of formation :  1. Wheat Executive. 2. Meat and Fats Executive. 3. Oil and Seeds Programme Committee. 4. Sugar Programme Committee. 5. General Munitions Council: Proposed Sub-Committees (a) Technical Sub-Committee.(b) Aircraft Committee.(c) Chemical Committee.(d) Explosives Committee.(e) Non-Ferrous Metal Committee. (/) Steel Committee.6. Nitrate of Soda Executive.7. Hides, Leather, Skins, and Tanning Materials Committee. 8. Wool (including Hair and all products and by-products of same) Committee. 9. Flax, Hemp, and Jute (including manufactures) Committee). 10. Horses and Mules Committee,11. Mechanical Transport.   (This Committee will probably become a Sub-Committee of the General Munitions Council.) 12. Petroleum Conference.13. Cotton Committee (Cotton and Cotton Textiles).14. Paper Committee.15. Tobacco and Matches Committee.16. Coal and Coke Committee.Of these 1, 2, 6, and 12 were in existence before the last meeting of the Council, while the others have been formed subsequently..With the exception of the Programme Committees, which are also executives having other duties like the Wheat Executive, the committees normally meet at Lancaster House, and the closest association is maintained between all the committees and the organisation of the Council. So far the new committees have been mainly engaged in arranging the details of their constitution and procedure, and deciding upon the exact nature of the information required before they can proceed with their main work of adjusting programmes. It must be recognised that this work will be a lengthy and difficult process. In the meantime the policy which it is proposed to follow is indicated in Appendix 7.9. Note on General Tonnage Position.The following are the main features in the general tonnage position: (a.) The deficit in carrying power as compared with imports has been reduced by the conclusion of the Swedish Agreement in addition to the acquisi-tion of the Dutch tonnage (allowed for in the last statement of the Council) and by some reduction in the submarine losses as compared with the previous estimates, (b) As reported in detail above, very large diversions of British tonnage have been made for the conveyance of cereals to France and Italy, for Railway material and Munitions to those two countries, and at the0  AS 5952 B
same time the fitting of vessels for American troops, and the use of cargo space for this purpose have made a serious reduction in importing capacity. As a consequence mainly of these causes the imports into the United Kingdom were 700*000 tons less in June than in May&apos;; (c) The most important new factor in the prospective Allied tonnage position is the immense increase in the American Military Programme recently required by the Supreme War Council and consented to by the &apos; American Government.It may be said generally that the execution of this Programme, so far as the carriage of personnel is concerned, can be effected by the continuance of the arrange-ments already made without further increasing the reduction in cargo-carrying power. The real problem is one of the carriage of supplies and of horses. This problem is now being investigated and further information is awaited from America.It may be stated provisionally, however, that the transport of full supplies for the full army contemplated would apparently involve the employment of not less than 7 to 8 million tons dead weight as- from the summer of 1919, the tonnage rising guadually in the meantime from the present 2 tons million dead weight to the above iigure, and that in addition the transport of horses would involve the employment of over 1 to 1^ million tons dead weight for a year, falling thereafter to some 300,000 tons dead weight for replacement of Avastage.Towards the above figures, which are likely to be increased by the transport of certain constructional material, &amp;c, can be set (a) the supply of material by the European Allies, whether under the brigading system or otherwise, and (o) the new American building, which each month goes a long way towards meeting the additional demands of the extra soldiers landed in 1 ranee during that month. &apos;It is understood that arrangements are being made by France and. Great Britain to supply artillery and clothing in large quantities which would relieve the Supply Programme, but it cannot yet be stated to what extent.These notes must be regarded as very provisional ordy and not expressing any agreed estimate, which is not yet possible, but it was thought necessary to attempt some indication of the scope of what is the most important new factor in the general tonnage situation. .  i-:- : .Apart from the uncertainties of building and construction, it is clear that the whole tonnage situation must be regarded as very;uncertain, in view of the possible consequences, and demands upon tonnage, that may result from the military situation.On the assumption that the American position is such as, on ithe whole, neither a gift to nor a take from the European allies more tonnage than at present, and that no important new factors enter into the situation, it^nay be said generally that while the import programmes still show a large excess over carrying power, and this cannot be removed until the Programme Committees have proceeded much further with their work, information which has already been received indicates within no very wide margin of uncertainty the directions in which the balance is likely to be struck for this current year 1918. :Programme Commitees have been informed that each 5,000 &apos; tons of imports saved means that about 1,000 additional American troops can be maintained in France.(10) The Permanent Organisatian of the Council.Since the last meeting of the Council Lancaster House has beon brought into use.. A central Secretariat and the American Division are already, located there, and the French and Italian Divisions are in course of being transferred to the same building. r :Experience has pointed to the necessity of certain developments in the organi-, sation which are described in detail in Appendix 8. These developments will be submitted for the approval of the Council at its next meeting. In the meantime the organisation is proceeding upon the lines indicated.        . .*11. Relation of the Council to the Inter-Allied Council on War Purchase andFinance.In accordance with the CounciPs decision the Inter-Allied Council on War Purchases and Finance was invited to appoint a Liaison Officer, and Mr. G. M. Booth is now acting in this capacity.Close co-operation between the organisations of the two Councils has been maintained and communications interchanged relating to the classification of imports, programmes proposed and actual purchases, &amp;c. ^ n r
APPENDIX 1.Note as to Responsibilities of the Franco-Italian Committee at Paris,, the Italian Representatives, and the London Organisation, for keeping Statistics of Supplyof Coal to Italy and France.I. Franco-Italian Comviittee at Paris. The Paris Committee is responsible for supervising the arrangements for: (a) The supply of coal from the French mines for Italy.(6) The railage arrangements for both French coal and British coal via the Bay, whether it goes to Italy via Ventimiglia and Modane or to the South French ports.(c) The provision of sufficient berths, &amp;c, for discharging the British coal landedin the Bay for transmission to Italy and for loading either British or French coal at South French ports.(d) Securing that the best qualities of French coal are supplied, for Italy, andascertaining the actual difference in the qualities of French and British coal.(e) Collecting and forwarding to the Secretary of the Allied Maritime TransportCouncil full statistics with regard to the above arrangements.The information required under (e) will be telegraphed daily to London in the . name of the Committee, will represent agreements between the French and Italian representatives, and will be regarded as authoritative on the points involved.   It will Consist of the following itenis:-&apos;(i) Daily quantities of British coal despatched by rail from Blaye and other Bay ports. .......................&apos;..............................-...... -12. Carriage of Oil in Double Bottoms.A communication was made to the Petroleum Conference in pursuance of the Councils directions as to the importance of discontinuing the use of double bottoms of ordinary cargo ships for carrying oil.A reply has been received stating that the matter was carefully considered at the recent meeting of the Petroleum Conference in Paris, and that it was found that in view of the increasing war requirements of petroleum products of all the Allies, the small amount of tank tonnage it is estimated might be saved by rearrangement of routing and source of supply, would, not in any way compensate for the relinquish-ment of the transport of oil in double bottoms on the Transatlantic routes. . The following resolution was passed by the Petroleum Conference : &quot; That the Conference, whilst in sympathy with the desires of the Allied Maritime Transport Council, is of the opinion that no alteration of the existing allocation of double bottoms used for the transport of Fuel Oil should be made until the stocks of Petroleum products have reached the danger minimum stocks required by each Government and that the Maritime Council be so informed.&quot;The Petroleum Conference have been requested to furnish information in regard to the Allied petroleum requirements, and when the programmes from all the Programme Committees are considered in relation to tonnage, the Council will have a further opportunity of raising with the Petroleum Conference, if necessary, the question of the use of double bottoms.13. Detention of Vessels under Legal Proceedings.A communication has been received from the Italian Government Commission that the Italian Government are prepared tu come to an agreement with the Allied Governments for the purpose of considering legislation prohibiting the detention or arrest of vessels requisitioned by or in the service of any of the Allied Governments, subject to proper safeguarding of legitimate interests.It is understood that the matter is being considered so far as the French Law is concerned by the competent French Authorities.
APPENDIX 2,Establishment of Regular Service of British Steamers between the United States and(a) France and (b) Italy.The agreement of the 3rd November 1917 has imposed an obligation upon Great Britain to supplement deficiencies in the tonnage required to transport the agreed shares of France and Italy in the Cereals Programme, and the effect of this agreement has been to give rise to frequent requests to the British Ministry of Shipping to divert cereals-carrying tonnage to France and Italy.These diversions have become so numerous and have frequently to be met at such short notice that it is often not practicable to meet the demands with the available tramp tonnage.The objections to the sudden diversion of liner tonnage operating in a particular trade and normally carrying mixed cargoes, do not need to be emphasised, and in these circumstances, with a view to general convenience of operation, it has been decided to institute regular services of British vessels, operated under the British Liner scheme, between the States and France and Italy.- A number of vessels are already working in&apos; these services, which it is proposed shall be strengthened from time to time as opportunity offers and the need arises. In this way a machinery is set up which enables Great Britain to meet, as far as practicable (a) The need of France for extra tonnage assistance for the carriage of loco-motives, barbed wire, and explosives, as indicated by the French Representative at the second session of the Council; and(V) The need of Italy for assistance in the carriage of munitions and essential general cargo from North America.The liners will, of course, also carry cereals and, where necessary, parcels for the British Army in France.(ii) Daily quantities of coal despatched from the French mines.(iii) Daily quantities of French coal passing the frontier between France andItaly.(iv) Daily quantities of British coal passing the frontier between Franceand Italy.(v) Daily quantities of French coal leaving South French ports for Italy.(vi) Daily quantities of British coal leaving South French ports for Italy.(vii) Daily stocks at each port in the Bay or South France.II. Italian Representatives. Will report quantities of British coal and of French coal respectively received by sea, whether by long or short route.III. London Organisation. Will be responsible for : (a) Keeping a record of shipments from United Kingdom to Italy.(b) Keeping a record of shipments from United Kingdom to Blaye, &amp;c,for Italy,(c) Keeping a record (in conjunction with Captain Pilliard) of the coaldue and supplied in pursuance of any agreement to give replace-ment coal to France.(d) Co-ordinating the above statistics and furnishing to the Councilperiodical reports as to the execution of any decision of the Council with regard to the supply of coal to either Italy or France.IV. The French Government will forward proposals to London on the question of allowing for the difference in calorific value of French and British coal.
APPENDIX 3.Note as to Proposed Principle of Allocation of Neutral Vessels brought into the pool under the direction of the Allied Maritime Transport Council.The main facts to bear in mind are the following : ., (1) If national programmes were fully agreed and there were no national divergencies of interest, all the shipping. under Allied control would doubtless be directed by a single Executive Authority which, in giving its orders, would have regard solely to the allocation of each vessel to the work on which, having regard to its type and position, it could be most economically employed.(2) As programmes have not been fully agreed and brought into conformity with the carrying power of the available tonnage and obviously cannot be, at any rate in the near future, there remains an actual or possible divergence of national interest and views in certain cases. It is the object of the A.M.T.C. and its organisation for the examination of import requirements, &amp;c, to arrange these differences by agreement. It is recognised, however, that divergencies may be too great or too serious for this&apos; to be possible in all cases.This is the fact upon which the principle of the A.M.T.O., that in the last resort each country retains executive authority over its own tonnage, is based.(3) By common consent, however, this principle is not applied to the small pool of neutral tonnage coming available for direct orders of the A.M.T.C. under the recent arrangements. This pool of tonnage is to receive actual and final executive orders from a single executive authority. That is to say, the intention is apparently that this tonnage should in fact be dealt with as Allied tonnage generally would be if there were no national divergence of interest and all executive power were concentrated in one authority.If this is to be the case, however, it is clear that the tonnage in question must be used in such a way as not to involve such a question of divergence of national interest as is safeguarded by the proviso of the constitution referred to in paragraph 2.As an illustration of this, it is obvious that an Ally which is supplementing the deficits of other Allies in specified services, e.g., cereals, could not consent to the allocation of a &quot;pool &quot; vessel which would be suitable for such a service to a service not agreed as essential.(4) A consideration of the detailed working of the A.M.T.C. presses this principle further. The general import, requirements of the Allies are being examined by the Imports Committee in connection with the Executives, and must finally be reviewed by the Council. So far as the permanent organisation is concerned, it is the Imports Committee rather than the Tonnage Committee which considers whether the need of one Ally for one import is greater or less than the needs of another Ally for another import. The &quot; pool &quot; allocations, however, or plan of allocations, must clearly be dealt with under the Tonnage Committee, but that Committee, while eminently qualified to agree as to the most suitable employment of a vessel is not the appropriate body to consider the relative needs of different imports of different Allies. Moreover, to consider such competing needs (which involve such wide issues and must clearly be examined as a whole) in connection with the allocation of specific vessels would obviously be a procedure likely to involve considerable disagreement and difficulty, and in the end would be futile in view of the much greater bulk of adjusting national tonnage on which the fulfilment of programmes ultimately depend.(5) It would seem to follow that &quot;pool&quot; vessels should be used solely for non-controversial services, i.e., put into services which by common consent require more tonnage than the &quot; pool &quot; vessels will themselves supply.It would obviously be convenient, in- the application of this principle, to choose the services beforehand which satisfy this principle, and the most obvious services are French coal, Italian coal, with return cargoes of ore on the ordinary principles, and Allied cereals. These services between them clearly afford sufficient scope for the economical use of every vessel that will come within the pool and each of these services will necessarily require supplementing by other vessels beyond those which can be obtained by the pool. This supplement will be provided partly by French and Italian national tonnage and partly also as a final adjusting element by the addition of other Allied tonnage,  If the pool is to be run in accordance with the principleB 3
dictated above, it would appear clear that the adjustments should be made not upon, the neutral pool of tonnage, but upon National and Allied tonnage.(6) If these principles are adopted it will enable the neutral vessels coining into pool to be allocated as between the services mentioned above solely upon the criterion as to which of the services the particular vessel is most suitable for, having regard to her type and position, and without regard to the competing requirements of the several countries and the possible difference of views as to the full extent of the import programme of each commodity in question which must be fulfilled.(7) With these principles adopted, the management of this small pool of neutral tonnage can proceed straight forward upon ordinary business lines and without involving discussions on particular cases as to the general interests of the different countries which obviously must be discussed and settled in a wider context.(8) If, however, it proves necessary or desirable to use the small fleet under direct A.M.T.C. control in order to give special assistance to any immediate and urgent work for which the Council may desire to take responsibility, the necessary orders should be given to the Tonnage Committee in the form of a direction to favour particular services with this tonnage to a specified extent so as to avoid any discussion by the Committee of the general imports situation in relation to particular allocations.13.5.18.APPENDIX 4.Note as to the Employment of Vessels engaged on Colonial Service.I. Great Britain. 1. Suitability.The question of bringing into Allied import or other service every suitable vessel is under constant consideration by the British Ministry of Shipping, and attempts to obtain all such vessels have been made. Certain vessels are, however, not available for the reasons indicated below.2. Colonial Tonnage.The question of diverting to direct war service tonnage engaged abroad in Colonial and other services has repeatedly engaged the attention of the British Ministry of Shipping, and, as a result of various measures that have been taken during the last 18 months, a very considerable proportion of the tonnage has been allocated to other services. For example, a large number of vessels have been taken out of the Indian and Far Eastern trades for the purpose of the Mesopotamian campaign, while since the outbreak of war tonnage to the amount of nearly 300,000 gross tons used on the Coast of Australia has been taken oft&apos; for service overseas. It must be remembered, moreover, that these reductions in the tonnage abroad have been accompanied by very drastic reductions in the amount of tonnage operating between the United Kingdom and India and the United Kingdom and Australia, so that the Committees concerned have been doubly hit.The British tonnage, which may be termed Colonial, falls into three groups: (1) Australasian trade, whether coasting or ocean; (2) Indian, Straits and Far Eastern trades; and (3) Canadian and American trades. Outside these groups there is practically no British tonnage engaged in any Colonial work.With regard to the three groups in question, the following facts are to be noted: Australasian Trades.The employment of the vessels included in this group may be divided as follows: (i) Coasting Australia.(ii) Coasting New Zealand.(iii) Australia-New Zealand.
(iv) Australia-Fiji and Outer Islands.(v) Australia-Straits, (vi) Australia China.(vii) Australia Pacific Coast of America.(viii) Australia S. and E. Africa.The number of vessels of 1,600 gross tonnage and ever engaged in these services at 31st May 1918 was 109, and of these vessels more than half are unsuitable for ocean-going work. Moreover, the vast majority of the vessels are on Colonial Register and Australia being a self-governing Dominion, His Majesty&apos;s Government under a general arrangement made with the Dominions does not exercise the power of requisi-tion over these vessels. In effect the agreement is that this power shall rest ultimately with the Government in whose ports the vessels are registered.Australia is a continent with an extended coast line and railway facilities that are quite inadequate to cope with the vital needs of the various States, unless aided by a considerable coastwise traffic. Communications must obviously be maintained between Australia and New Zealand and the Islands in the Pacific, while Australia is, of course, obliged to obtain certain imports from such places as the Straits, China, South Africa, North and South America.As already indicated, a large amount of tonnage has been released from Australasian Trade for various war services, and, having regard to the factors referred to above, the Shipping Controller does not think that under present conditions it would be practicable to urge the diversion of any further appreciable quantity of tonnage. The Commonwealth Government is, however, now taking the whole matter energetically in hand, and a Controller of Shipping has been appointed in order to reorganise on the most economical tonnage basis and by reference to vital needs the various Australasian trades, and it is hoped that his efforts will enable some further vessels to be released for Allied service overseas.3. Indian, Straits and Far Eastern Trades. /The tonnage in these trades has been reduced to a minimum, and the total number of vessels of 1,600 gross tonnage and over in all the trades on 31st May 1918 was 113.The various services carried on by these vessels are as follows ;--(i) Coasting India.(ii) Coasting China.(iii) India--Burmah.(iv) India -Straits and East Indies.(v) India China and Japan.(vi) India Australia.   -(vii) India United States, (viii) India-West Indies.(ix) India-South Africa.(x) India-East Africa,(xi) India Persia.&quot;(xii) India--Red Sea.      :   - ;(xiii) Coasting East Indies or China. - &apos;(xiv) Coasting East Indies and Straits.(xv) Straits-Far East, . ;(xvi) Straits East Africa. .-  ;(xvii) Coasting in Red Sea.(xviii) Coasting in Persian Gulf. , - :These services have been freely drawm upon to provide transport for the campaigns in Mesopotamia and Palestine. For example, early in 1917, 61 vessels belonging to the China Navigation, Indo-China Navigation and other local Chinese companies were requisitioned and withdrawn from these trades for Government Service in connection with the Mesopotamian Campaign, and at about the same time a considerable number of the British India Company&apos;s vessels were withdrawn from the Indian trade.In order to make the best possible use of the tonnage which has been left in the trades and to enable the various services to be maintained as far as possible and with the greatest economy of tonnage, His Majesty&apos;s Government suggested to theB i
Governments of India, Singapore and Hong Kong that a representative of the British Ministry of Shipping should be appointed to organise these trades. This suggestion was acted upon, and in the autumn of 1917 an Agent of the Shipping Controller was appointed for India and the Far East. A wide-spread organisation has since been built up and influential Committees and Agents appointed at the principal ports, with the result that the otherwise inadequate amount of tonnage remaining in the trades is utilised to the best possible advantage, and it has even been found possible to release further vessels for Allied service.It must be remembered, however, that of the steamers engaged in the trades in question, and particularly in the China Coastal Trades, a large proportion are passenger steamers of an age and type which would be quite unsuitable for oversea transport trades.4. Canadian and American Trades.The number of vessels of 1,600 gross tonnage and over engaged in these trades on 31st May 1918 was 77.The majority of these vessels are engaged in the Canadian coasting trade and the other trades served as follows: (i) North America West Indies.(ii) North America-East and West Africa.(iii) North America Pacific to Far East.(iv) Coasting Colon and West Coast of South America, (y) Coasting West Indies.Nearly all the vessels in this group are on Colonial Register, and Canada being a self-governing Dominion, the same position in regard to the exercise of the power of requisitioning exists as in the case of Australia referred to above, and the Dominion Government has expressed the opinion that it is not practicable to make further reductions in the tonnage engaged in these trades, which is regarded as being at a minimum.The whole question of the tonnage engaged in these Colonial trades will be discussed at the Imperial Conference this year, when it is hoped that useful proposals and decisions may be obtained.II. France.Statement re The French Colonial and Intercolonial Tonnage Council.The Statement herewith attached showrs the pre-war and actual position of vessels engaged in Franco-colonial and intercolonial traffic and brings forth the reduction which each service has to bear.Before the war, each shipping company engaged in colonial traffic used to employ French cargo-boats and chartered vessels according to the season and to actual requirements in addition to the vessels running regularly in those traffics.At present not only is the French Colonial traffic deprived of the additional cargo-vessels and chartered steamers, but also regular liners have been greatly diminished.A reduction in vessels therein employed has handicapped some of the French colonies to the extent of not allowing them to ship their crops owing to the lack of tonnage.Notwithstanding this condition the French colonial traffic has not been allotted an additional single vessel for continual use since the beginning of the war and only at times has it been found possible to meet emergency requirements.with some occasional ships.The French Intercolonial traffic is actually carried on by a fleet of 5 steamers of a gross tonnage over 1,600 tons each as per list given at the end of attached statement (this does not include vessels under 1,600 tons gross).It is therefore impossible to consider at the present time the withdrawal of a single ship from colonial, and intercolonial traffic, and should the tonnage position improve, it would be most urgent for France to be able to place some vessels in that trade to lift most essential cargoes wrhich are now lying imports and greatly suffering damage.

Meanwhile the following facts may be noted : (1) Tonnage operating between the United States and non-contiguous territories has been allocated to that service primarily to meet the needs of the United States and not because of the territorial requirements.(2) There is no merchant tonuage, which is controlled by the United States, operating between United States non-contiguous territories and foreign countries.(3) Steam merchant tonnage controlled by the United States and in the service of the territories for purely territorial purposes was on 15th June 1918 as follows :-
APPENDIX 6.Communication to the Allied Naval Council.In pursuance of the Council&apos;s resolution that there should be an examination by the Allied Naval Authorities with a view to reducing the demand by the Allied Navies on mercantile tonnage, a communication was sent to the Allied Naval Council, which was considered by that body at its recent meeting in London.The following conclusion was reached :    &apos;&quot; Revision of Naval Requirements of Merchant Tonnage.&quot; It was agreed that the request of the Allied Maritime Transport Council, that the Allied Naval Council should bring to the notice of the several Admiralties the extreme importance of seeing that calls on merchant tonnage are kept down to a minimum shall be complied with and that the greatest economy should be exercised in the use of ships now allocated to the Navies.&quot; It was further decided that each Ministry of Marine should prepare a list of the merchant tonnage which is employed on its naval services, together with an explanation of the service on which employed and the method of operation, and forward the list to the Secretary of the Council for transmission to the Allied Maritime Transport Council. These lists will then be scrutinised by the Allied Maritime Transport Council, who will ask the several Ministries of Marine for such further information in regard to the same that may be required, and the several Ministries of Marine will discuss with the Allied Maritime Transport Council in the most co-operative spirit any suggestions regarding methods in which it may appear to be practicable to effect economy of tonnage.&quot;A list prepared by the French Ministry of Marine of the Auxiliary Fleet of the French Navy has been received, and the other lists are expected in clue course. Steps will then he taken to examine the lists, and, if necessary, to communicate with the several Ministries of Marine, as suggested by the Allied Naval Council.appendix 7.Allied Maritime Transport Council Memorandum as to supply Programmes in relation toallocation of Tonnage.Programme Committees may find it useful to have the following Memorandum with regard to the relation of the programmes which they produce from time to time to the allocation of tonnage required to give effect to them.It is intended that this Memorandum should be read in continuation of Memorandum &quot;A&quot; dated 25th May. As each Programme Committee produces an agreed programme in accordance with the principles described in Memorandum &quot; A &quot; and on the forms subsequently circulated, it should be forwarded to the Secretary of the Allied Maritime Transport Council, Lancaster House, S.W. 1, for consideration in conjunction with other programmes and in relation to the tonnage position as a whole.It will be realised that the production of an agreed supply programme by a Programme Committee is only the first stage towards the decision as to the extent to which the tonnage requested can be allotted.On receipt of all the programmes or of such a number as together represent the great bulk of the transport required, it is proposed that they shall be at once examined in relation to the estimated carrying power of the available tonnage by the administrative organisation of the Council. This organisation consisting of the members representing the different countries on imports and tonnage respectively and with such further advice as it may be practicable and desirable to obtain will both endeavour to ascertain to what extent a reduction of the total of the programmes is necessary and then make a provisional plan allotting this reduction as between the different commodities. In this work the organisation will normally regard it as their duty to make their suggestions in a form showing rather the reduction applicable to each supply programme as a0 2
whole than the distribution of the reduction between the Allies, which is for the Programme Committee itself to consider.       - -After having arrived at a provisional plan of this character, each Programme Committee will be informed of the suggested percentage reduction on its programme as submitted and requested to consider and report what proposed redistribution of the commodity in question it would propose to arrange as between the different countries, and secondly, what would be the position of. each country and of the. Allied supply programmes as a whole on&apos;the assumption of such a reduction, with supporting information as to stocks, consumption, &amp;c. The information so received from the Programme Committees will form- the basis of a considered and com pre-&apos; hensive plan which the administrative organisation will submit to the next meeting of the Allied Maritime Transport Council. The Council itself, after such further consultation with representatives of the Programme Committees as may be desirable, will attempt, to arrange a definite and comprehensive programme.1 While the administrative organisation can, of course, in anticipation of the meeting of the Ministers of the Council only make tentative proposals for a plan of the above character, it is of the greatest importance that the Programme Committees should put them in a position to carry the development of the plan to the furthest possible stage in order that the final work left to be done at a formal meeting of the Transport Council may be reduced within manageable limits.This procedure&apos; is proposed as the permanent procedure when the Programme Committee system is in full operation. Special consideration, however, requires to be given to the position now arising from week to week as a particular Programme Committee produces a programme either provisionally or&quot;finally agreed.It is clear from the foregoing considerations that it is impossible that immediate effect should be given to any such programme by the. allocation of the corresponding tonnage, as the result of such action would be to give a priority to the supply programme of the committee which happened to produce its programme first at the expense of other commodities without any balance between the two, which would defeat the main object of the Transport Council.At the same time it must be expected that the complete establishment of a comprehensive programme must take some considerable time and that readjustments of the supplies as between the Allies upon the advice of the Programme Committees cannot be entirely suspended in the meantime.The conditions under which it is most likely that tonnage adjustments may be made in conformity with the advice of a Programme Committee in the intermediate period before all the programmes have been adjusted are the following :-(1) Where the programme as a whole represents a considerable reduction upon the total of the previous national programmes, and in particular where the programme as a whole does&apos;not require transport exceeding the total tonnage already provisionally allocated or assured to the conveyance of the commodity in question, an agreed decision (with the assent, of the representative of the country whose tonnage would require to be diverted) would prima facie constitute a case for the reallocation of tonnage. (2) In other cases, i.e., where a programme involves an increase in the total tonnage allocated or assured to the commodity in question there is more chance of tonnage being provided if the commodity is one whose import-(a) involves little or no conflict of Allied interest,(b) if beyond any doubt the import in question up to the quantity asked wouldbe required either within the period for which it is asked, or within a somewhat longer period during which it can be conveniently stored, and(c) if it is obvious that an increased importation will not result in any unnecessaryconsumption.These conditions are obviously more nearly satisfied in the . case of such commodities as munitions, nitrates and railway wagons than in those where either commercial considerations or the needs of the civilian population are involved.It must, however, in any case be expected that any such readjustments of tonnage in anticipation of the general settlement must be upon a comparatively minor scale.It is also desirable that Programme Committees should have the following general considerations in mind : (1) The extent to which it proves possible to secure the allocation&apos;of tonnage in confojmity with Programme Committees must necessarily depend in a
-2.1.. -: very large measure on the extent to which - all four countries have really become integral parts of the organisation as a whole&apos; and are willing to allow both their tonnage and their import programmes to be subject to effective Allied criticism, and to assent to any consequent alterations both in the employment of tonnage and the arrangement of their import programmes which may be recommended. It must be recognised that so long as the only action resulting is in effect the diversion of tonnage &apos;; belonging to one of the Allied countries, the action required must necessarily be provisional only and will be in the nature of ex gratia arrangements on the part of the Ally in question.(2)&quot;It.must also be remembered that the National programmes as at present submitted taken together largely exceed the possible carrying, power of Allied tonnage. Upon the last review the excess of such&apos; demands in the case of the European Allies amounted to about 15 per cent.(3) Moreover, since the date of this review, the American military programme has been immensely increased, with a corresponding increase in the American military supply programme. The extra strain thus thrown on tonnage much more than cancels the measure of&apos; relief due to the acquisition,of Dutch tonnage and somewhat lower submarine losses.APPENDIX 8&apos;.Note as to Duties and Gonstitation oa the Permanent Organisation of the Allied MaritimeTranpsort Council.The permanent organisation is the Executive of the Council.Duties. Its duties are :-(a) To, secure the necessary executive action to give effect to decisions by the Council.(6) To prepare information relevant to any question which the Council may wish to discuss at future meetings.(c) To suggest definite proposals for the approval of the Council; and(d) To take such executive action as is desirable and practicable in conformitywith the general policy of the Council and in pursuance of the general duty of assisting in the allocation and most advantageous use of Allied :,  - . tonnage by co-operative action.The general sphere of duties of the permanent organisation is coterminous with that of the Council, the difference between the decisions and action of the two depending upon the difference in authority. The permanent organisation will thus fake action on any question within the sphere of the Couucil&apos;s duties as defined by the Paris resolutions, except so far as action would involve decisions of such importance as to require approval by the Council itself. Each main national repre-sentative in. the permanent organisation (after communication with his Government when necessary) will be responsible for saying that any proposed action, in the view of his Government&apos;s representatives on the- Council, requires the prior approval of the Transport Council in formal session, and may be proceeded with by the permanent organisation.Constitution. The governing body of the permanent organisation will consist of one representative of each country.This body will be termed the Allied Maritime Transport Executive, the same name being for convenience applied to the organisation working under this body.The permanent organisation will be as follows : --1. There will be four national divisions, each responsible for the purposes of the Executive to its national member on the governing body and dealing with (i) Tonnage.(ii) Import programmes,with statistical and national staff working in connection with these sections as may be convenient.0 3
2. The work of the four divisions will he co-ordinated by the following Executive Committees :-(i) Tonnage (or Traffic) Committee.(ii) Imports Committee. .The Tonnage Committee will be  responsible for the following permanent duties: (a) Arranging for the due execution of any decision of the Council or theExecutive involving the co-operative use or programming of tonnage.(b) Obtaining and making available for general use statements showing theamount and disposition of the tonnage under the control of each Ally.(c) Examining proposals made by any country with a view to securing a moreadvantageous use of tonnage under the control of any Ally (whether by the better disposition, routing, or more co-operative use of the tonnage or the better assignment of cargoes in relation to import programmes), and, so far as possible, to arrange that agreed improve-ments shall be carried into effect.The Committee will arrange through the Secretariat for any statistical work required in connection with the above duties by the national statistical staffs.(ii) Imports Committee.The Imports Committee will be responsible for the following permanent duties : (a) In general for seeing that such work as is required for the reduction ofImport Programmes to within the carrying capacity of the available tonnage is duly effected through the relevant machinery both of the Council and the Programme Committees.(b) Watching the constitution of the Programme Committees to see that theirnumber, composition, terms of reference (both on original appointment and later if any modifications are desirable) are such as to subseive the above purpose.(c) Seeing that the Programme Committee prepare and present the informationas to their programmes in a uniform and suitable manner, and with this object for furnishing them with any necessary forms and making such communications to them as are desirable.(d) Obtaining such supplementary information as may be desirable in additionto what is furnished by the Programme Committees, including informa-tion as to articles wrhich may at any time not be covered by a Programme Committee.(e) Preparing a plan (in association with such other persons as may be desir-able) for a reduction of the total of the import programmes furnished by the Programme Committees to within the carrying capacity of the available tonnage; and for ascertaining from the Programme Committees the effect of any reduction involved in such a plan ; with a view to submission of definite proposals by the Executive to the Transport Council.(/) Arranging that such statistical and other information as may be required for the execution of the above duties is collected and collated.For the correspondence and statistical work involved in the above duties the Committee will work through the Secretariat.Statistical Work-The statistical work of the Executive will be in charge of a statistician, who will be a member of the Secretariat, will keep in touch with the Committees of the Executive, will co-ordinate the work of the national statistical staffs, and will arrange for the preparation such reports and summary statements as the Committees and the Secretariat may require.3. In ad dition the work of the several Divisions and Committees will be co-ordinated W o central Secretariat which will be non-national.All the members of this Secretariat, of whatever nationality they may be, will -d themselves as the servants of the organisation as a whole and not of any nal division.They will be organised under a secretary on ordinary office lines.
General Plan of Work for the rest of this Year.A. Imports Committee.1. The first duty of the Imports Committee is to see that the Programme Committees are constituted as rapidly as posoible ; that their constitution is such as to enable them to give the technical advice required with regard to the respective commodities, and that they are properly linked to the Executive Departments of the respective Governments so as to secure the necessary authority for their recommendation s.2. The next duty of the Committee is to see that the Programme Committees are informed as to the exact nature of the information required for the purpose of the Council, and the form in which it should be presented. They will arrange with the Secretariat for any necessary correspondence for this purpose.3. They will be responsible for obtaining the programmes from the different Committees. After ascertaining the total amount by which the programmes so obtained exceed the carrying power, of vessels under allied control for the remainder of this year the Imports Committee will be responsible for making a scheme (after such consultation with Programme Committees as may be desirable) for so reducing the programme for any commodity or commodities as to bring the total imports within the total carrying power.The Executive would then present to the Transport Council the plan as a whole (writh any modifications that might seem desirable) with a summary of the replies of the Programme Committees.4. In carrying out the above responsibilities, the Imports Committee will take the end of the cereal year as the date by which programmes must be reduced within the estimated carrying power of tonnage so that the allocation of tonnage can be determined,.in the first instance, for the remainder of the year subject only to such adjustments as may afterwards be necessary as the result of later events, and as soon as possible a continuation programme for the next year.c iThe duties of the Secretariat will be : (a) To see that work involved in decisions of the executive is properly allotted as between the International Committees or National Divisions, and to remind the various persons concerned of any outstanding work requiring to be done and the date by which it is required.(6) To see that the work of the above bodies is duly co-ordinated, e.g., that the Tonnage Committee is not doing work which is being simultaneously done by the Imports Committee or vice versa; and that nobody is working on a policy inconsistent with that of the Executive.(c) To conduct all correspondence in the name of the Executive; to collate information required by the several Committees ; to keep minutes of the Committees ; to take charge of all international papers (including minutes both of the Council and the Committees, correspondence, international files, and statistics).For the purpose of (b) members of the Secretariat will attend the various meetings of the Committees, in the capacity of Secretaries, not members.In general the Secretariat will be responsible not for policy but for the administrative work of giving due effect to decisions of policy.It is desirable to supplement the above note as to the permanent organisation and its duties by the following special note as to work in the immediate future.The main factor in the situation is that Programme Committees are only now being brought into existence, and it is impossible to arrange for the allocation of shipping in accordance with their programmes in the next few months. It is, at the same time, of the utmost importance that working programmes should be obtained and used as a guide to executive action as from the end of the cereal year onwards. The intermediate months must be regarded as an emergency period, shipping being-allotted rather with a view to keep each country above danger point in each commodity so far as the position of shipping (which can only be diverted or used for other than already arranged programmes within narrow limits) render practicable.
Lancaster House, July lQth 1918.5. In addition to the above duties, the Imports Committee will be responsible for seeing that proper information is obtained and collated as to the actual imports in comparison with the programmes&apos;; monthly reports being obtained from each country&quot; for this purpose as from the 1st January 19.15. These reports must be similar in form and arranged in conformity with the categories of commodities shown/in the Import Programme.B. Tonnage Committee.Apart from the general duties of the Tonnage Committee indicated above the duty of the Tonnage Committee in the immediate future will be as follows : 1. Period for arrivals up to the end of August.(a) The Tonnage Committee will deal with any questions that may arise as to the allocation of neutral vessels in the pool in conformity with the general principles set out in the approved memorandum and working plan.(ft) They will make an investigation, in accordance with the decision of the last Council meeting, of the Tonnage in Colonial service.(c) They will consider proposals rendering practicable the withdrawal ofvessels from more distant trades to the Atlantic.(d) They will arrange for the preparation and circulation of periodical reportsas to the position of the programmes for which the Council have accepted special responsibility, viz., Belgian Relief, Italian coal, French coal, using the Sacretariat as may be convenient.2. The period after the end of August.When the reduced programmes within the estimated carrying power of tonnage have been agreed, the work of the Tonnage Committee will become mainly that of a Traffic Committee, its responsibility being to arrange with the respective Governments for the allocation of tonnage in such a way as to secure the imports in the agreed programmes.In arranging this Tonnage Programme, the import requirements of each of the Allies will in the &quot;first place be met by the.tonnage under the:Ally&apos;s control (national and neutral) subject to (a) the assumption by one Ally of any specified responsibility for the whole or any part of a particular Supply Service, and (b) the interchange of vessels to secure the most economical use of tonnage.
