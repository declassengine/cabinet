BATTLE SITUATION - NOON - 5th AUGUST 1918.

1. WESTERN FRONT.

(a) French Front. There is no appreciable change in the situation between RHEIMS and S0ISSONS, and heavy fighting is in progress at certain points on the banks of the VESLE.

Between FISMES and RHEIMS the line now runs approximately as follows:- south of LA NEUVILETTE, CHATEAU DE LA MALLE, CHAMPIGNY, northern edge of LA GARENNE DE GEUX, thence westwards along the Route Nationale to the south of MUIZON, thence along the southern bank of the VESLE to FISMES. This town is now in our hands. Two battalions have crossed the VESLE, one at JONCHEERY and one between JONCHERRY and FISMES. Certain elements have also crossed at FISMES.

Between FISMES and SOISSONS, BRAINE is still occupied by the enemy, the French however hold LA GRANGE FARM, (on the northern bank of the VESLE, northwest of BRAINE), this Farm, which had been mined by the enemy, blew up, but in spite of this the French are still holding on there.

Between MONTDIDIER and CASTEL our line now runs approximately as follows:- MORISEL (German), BRACHES (French), HARGICOURT (doubtful), eastern edge of BOUILLANCOURT WOOD, FRAMICOURT, western outskirts of COURTEMANCHE, and half-way between MESNIL ST GEORGE and MONTDIDIER.
