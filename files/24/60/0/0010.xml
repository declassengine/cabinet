WESTERN FRONT.

G.T.5310

(a) French Front. Between REIMS and SOISSONS the withdrawal of the enemy continues throughout the whole front and enemy resistance appears to have weakened considerably.

In certain places the French have been able to push forward Cavalry Patrols to keep in touch with the retreating enemy.

French Troops are in SOISSONS and probably the town has been captured but this is not confirmed.

POMMIERS on the Northern Bank of the AISNE (North west of SOISSONS) has also been occupied.

VAUXCERE, FISHES and VAUXTIN (North East of FISMES) are reported burning.
