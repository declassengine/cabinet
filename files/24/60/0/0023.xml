In addition to this, fittings of some sort would have to be designed and installed in the machines to carry and release these leaflets, and, of course, only the heavier types of machines would be suitable for the purpose.
oI., 0Another serious factor, alluded to above, which must be considered is the effect that such a policy would have,on the moral of the pilots themselveso   It will be recollected that the Germans have   expressed very definite threats of reprisals, and although no doubt the pilots would loyally carry out any policy which was decided upon, there would be s. considerable danger of lowering the general moral.   Again, the risk to machines and personnel is equally as great when carrying a load of leaflets as when carrying a load of bombs, and it would be only natural for the pilots to feel that they were running the risj-c of being shot down while engaged on an operation productive of no visible results.   The danger Is accentuated by the fact that the work, to be successful must be performed by daylight.In view of the above considerations the Air Council have come to the conclusion that it is not desirable at present to employ aeroplanes for thi-s purpose, and in this view the General Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force In the Field, and the General Officer Commanding, Independent Force concur.X am, Sir,Your obedient servant,(Sd.)
