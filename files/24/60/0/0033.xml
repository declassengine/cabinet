eKhJibm of coal miners.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.iTith reference to the Minute cn this subject by the War Priorities Committee which was forv/arded to the War Cabinet (g.T.5265), i have consultod the Goal Controller -and am of opinion that the balance of advantage is in favour of mentioning no date up to which the recruiting of coal miners shall be suspended.The Coal Controller informs me that at the meeting of. the -Jar Priorities Committee he suggested that, if a date was mentioned at all, it should not be earlier than the 31st March nest, i.e. the end of the winter. He has however since the meeting consulted various people on the subject, including some owners, and has come to the conclusion that it would probably be better not to mention the matter at all.   The men know that recruiting has been suspended --they also know that where the quotas have been obtained medical examination is not being continued and they are gradually settling down to work again.There seems reason to fear that, if any date is mentioned, it may result in the gradual slackening down of work towards the time when that date will be reached. On the other hand, the attention which has  now been drawn to the question of the coal supply will, it is believed, bring the matter before the miners sufficiently.A.H. STANLEY.d of Trade,6th August, 1918.
