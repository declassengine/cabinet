The Maternity and Child Welfare Bill has passed through all its stages and a Circular is being issued to the Local Authorities concerned impressing on them the importance of the vigorous exercise of the increased powers conferred by the Act and notifying them of the large extension of the services in respect of which the Government grant in aid of Maternity and Child Welfare Schemes will be available.3.     A Memorandum has been submitted to the War Cabinet on the subject of the attitude of local authorities towards&apos; the Government proposals for financial assistance towards the cost of schemes of housing after the War.3.     The Ministry of Health Bill has continued to receive consideration and a memorandum of the functions of the Local Government Board has been prepared for use in considering to what extend a transference of any of the functions to other Government Departments would be practicable4.     The Law Officers for England, Scotland and Ireland, have given their opinions on the questions submitted to them on the subject of the right of women to sit in the House of Commons and the duty of the Returning Officer in connection with nominations of women candidates, and the question of the action to bs taken in pursuance of the opinions is receiving consideration.5,     A Circular has been issued to Registration Officers giving instructions as to the notice of the method of voting by post or proxy to be sent to naval or military voters and other absent voters, and as to the form of the record to be kept of the addresses of absent voters.6.     A Conference is being arranged with the Party Whips and representatives of the Post Office, Admiralty, far Office, Scottish Office, and Irish Office to consider what arrange-ments can be made for enabling the views of candidates for Parliament to be placed before naval and military voters in connection with any election during the War.7.     A conference of Chairmen of Metropolitan Military Service Tribunals has Seen held at which the President emphasised the importance of the vigorous encouragement by Tribunals of co-operation among retail traders, SO as to en-sure the preservation of the businesses of men called to the Colours.8.    A copy is annexed of a statement recently prepared on returns obtained from Tribunals, which indicates the strictness of the standards adopted by them in the determina-tion of appeals.  - A copy of the statement has been supplied to the Minister of rational Service.9.     An Order has been made under the Defence of the Realm Acts empowering local authorities to issue licences to boys of sixteen to drive motor cars other than cars over two tons in weight of cars plying for hire, in view of the increasing difficulty of securing labour for civil purposes.
jtati/jtic;; off 741. , The total Tribunal exemptiona at the end of May are estimated at 502.000, being 9o*OCO lose than the total at the end of November lastsAny figures from Tribunals now of total outstanding exemptions are not likely to be more than a rough estimate.because it is almost impossible for them to say exactly how many exemptions have been withdrawn by proclamations or orders.   The total number of exemptions returned by them ia likely to be an. over-statement than otherwise because, in a number of oases, they will not be able to say that a man18 exemption has been withdrawn.2.     During the month of ivlay the Tribunals decided 89,000 oases.   ISxemption was refused or withdrawn In 30 per cent of these cases.Very few cases of men of the new military ages would have been dealt with during the month of M&amp;y, so that nearly all the 89,000 were the cases of men applying for renewal, or whose cases were reviewed, or who were called up for the first time (men who had previously been in a low grade, and made original applications)*3*     of the total number of men exempted, 16^ are known to be grade 1 men.   (It is possible that this percentage understates the total because Tribunals did not know in some cases whether the men were in grade 1)*A statement has been prepared of special returns received from a number of Tribunals which gives in more detail information as to the grades of the men whose cases came up for consideration. In these particular Tribunals less than 20 per cent, of the cases that came up for consideration were those of grade 1 men, about 30 per cent, were grade 2 men, and over 4-5 per cent were grade 3 men;   in some of the cases the grades were not stated.So far as men of the old military ages are concerned, there is no gainsaying that very few men indeed who are grade 1 could now be called up without grave dislocation or hardship, unless proper substitutes are available.4.-    The total number of outstanding cases at the end ofthe month of Uay was 72,000*liTom. the returns which have been looked through it is clear that Tribunals generally are little to blame for delay. Where there is any large ^lum^er of cases outstanding, it is almost invariably found that most of them are with the National Service Representative or are cases in which the men are awaiting medical examination.The number of cases outstanding with appeal Tribunals was much higher than usual because they were dealing during May with the agricultural cases under the proclamation.5.     Information is provided in the returns of the Appeals in which decision is notified during the month by the Appeal Tribunals.   The number was (5,Sou, which was much less than It per cent, of the cases decided during the month.Of the total number of appeals those which have been made by the National Service Representative were only about a third of the total, and less than 3 per cent, of the total number of cases decided during the month.     It seems clear therefore that there is little cause for complaint with the decisions of the Local Tribunals, from the military standpoint at least.
