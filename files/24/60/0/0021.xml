Ho. 545/39 G.SUMMARY, of INFORMATION for the month of JUNE, 1918-GBNERAL.On Juno 15th the 2nd (ATHENS) Division, having completed its training at NAHESH, was placed under my command and pro ceo do d to the 16th British Corps area W. of the SALONIKA-SSR32S Road-General PAR/iSttEVOFOULOS assumed command of the 1st Greek Army Corps, consisting of the 1st, 2nd and 13th Divisions, and on June 16th established his Headquarters at kilo.61.6 on the SALONIKA - SERES Road.   This Greek Army Corps is attach?d to my 16th Corps.On June 26th the relief of the 27th Division-by the 13th and 1st Greek Divisions was complete j this division, less two artillery brigades and one howitzer battery, is now moving in relief of the French 122nd Division West of the VARDAR.       The * relief of the 64th and 83rd Brigades of the 28th Division by the 2nd Greek Division Is now in progress.There have been no operations of any importance during the poriod under review on the British fronts, a few patrol cnoounters only having taken place.       During the past month however the hostile artillery has shewn a ma rice d increase of activity, particularly against the DO I RAN - VARDAR sector.Numerous Bulgarian prisoners gave themselves up about the middle of the month along the whole STRUM front as well as on other portions of the allied front.    They all predicted a Bui gar attack between OKPAKO and LAKE DOIRAN, to dates given for this attack ranging bet wen June 15th and 18th.   No attack materialised and It appears from recent desertersf statements that the troops wore in a most mutinous state and refused to attack.   Special reports on this wore forwarded on 26th June 1918 under this office 240*979 I and 992/2 I *The Royal Air Force has again been wry active bombing hostile camps, dumps and aerodromes almost daily.    Enemy aircraft have shown more enterprise than usual with the result that many combats have taken plaoe in which eight hostile machines have been destroyed and a further five driven down out of control whs re as our losses were one machine missing.ALLIED -FORCES.On June 11th French troops operating on tbe KAIUR S.W. Of LAKE OCHRIDA captured the summits of Hill 2150 and MT.LENIA and the villages of  fcKELOA and POPOISTE.

9 p.ADMINISTRATION.As the supply arrangements of the Greek Corps on the STRUM front were most unsatisfactory, I have attached a Staff officer to headquarters of 1st Greek Corps and also Supply officers to each division and railhead, in order to instruct the greeks in proper methods of supply.
