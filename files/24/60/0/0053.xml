BATTLE SITUATION - EVENING - 8th AUGUST, 1918.

ULSTER - FRONT.

The attack commenced by the British IVth and 1st French Armies this morning from MORLANCOURT to MONTDIDIER is making satisfactory progress. The latest reports indicate that the following line, from north to south, has been reached:- high ground south of MORLANCOURT, CHIPILLY, MORCOURT, HARBONNIER CAIX, BEAUCOURT, VILLIERS-AUX-ERABLES, 1,000 yards east of MOREUIL, 1,500 yards east of LA NEUVILLE. This represents a depth at some points of nearly 7 miles. The attack was a complete surprise to the enemy who did not carry out any counter-bombardment. A considerable number of prisoners has been taken together with a number of guns, but no estimate is yet available. It is reported that our cavalry are now in action.

North of the LYS we have occupied part of the German front line, between the LYS and the railway line from MERVILLE to HAZEBROUCK.

On the French front there is nothing of special interest to report.

2. ITALIAN AND MACEDONIAN FRONTS.

The general situation remains unchanged.
