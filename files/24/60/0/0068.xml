The arrangements described in tho previous Reports for the employment of school boys in agricultural operations are being successfully carried out and a considerable number of boys are at the present moment spending a portion of the summer holidays onmthe land.    The School Authoritieo, in co-operation with the Ministry of National Service, have arranged for the organisation of Campo and for the release of boys from school for short periods during the past Summer Term to aesiot in the hay harvest ana otherof school children in collecting blackberries for making jam during the Autumn X have issued a Circular to Local Education Authorities suggesting that they should put themselves in touch with tht Divisional Food Commissioners who are setting up special organisa-tions for dealing with the matter.    The Authorities are being invited, in consultation with the Board&apos;s Inspectors, to arrange for the giving of two or three half holidays a week, where necessary, in order to enable the children to assist in the picking of the blackberry crop.I have also caused a Circular to be issued to County Local Education Authorities, at the suggestion of the National SalvageCouncil, asking them to give facilities for the collection by school children of fruit stones and nut shells which are required for urgent war purposes,3. In the result of Conferencesheld between Officers of myDepartment and representatives of the Ministry of National Service a new Circular has been Issued modifying the arrangements with regard te the military service of Teachers and Educational Officials Under the revised arrangements:-(a)    Subject te the exception referred to below, all Teachersagricultural work.2.In response to an appeal from the Food Ministry for the helpand Sducatitnal Officials in Grade I. who were under 45 and1.all
all Grade II. men who were under 36 on the let January ,1918, will be released for service with the Colours: (b)    The protection hitherto accorded to Grade III. men willbe continued and men in Grade IX. who were over 36 andthose in Grade I. who were over 45 on the 1st January lastwill be protected.Individual protection may, however, be given to men specially recommended by the Board to the Ministry of National Service;   but the Board of Education will only give thio recommendation in cases in which they are satisfied that retention is absolutely essential to the efficiency of the School or Institution.The general effect of the modifications is to render an increased number, of younger men liable for service while securing the retention of the older mon.    The administration of the prevlou arrangements has worked smoothly and although the depletion of the staffs of Schools is rendering it increasingly difficult to maintai as high a standard of efficiency as could be desired 1 feel confide that the Local Education Authorities and Teachers will meet this fresh call with the same patriotic spirit as heretofore.The Offioe Committee which I appointed Hto consider and advioe the Board ac to types of buildings whioh will be required fo compulsory Continuation Schools, the extent to which existing buildings oan be utilised, the possibility of using temporary buildings at the beginning of the new system, and tho probable coot of providing or adapting and equipping such buildings ah are required&quot;, has presented its Report, whioh is now under ay consideration.As a result of communications between my Department and the Lands and Buildings Reconstruction Committee upon the subject of the temporary buildings which are now in the occupation of the War Office, the Ministry of Munitions and other Departments, I am causing a Circular to be issued to Local Education Authorities suggesting that they should place themeelvee in communication withthe
Ithe Committee with * view tc- asjjerfcadningrwtet toildJjoga in their areao are likely te &quot;become available.    It is hoped that a number of these temporary buildings will be capable of being used for such purposes as temporary Elementary or Secondary Schools, Special Subjects Centres. Halle for Physical Exercises, or Continuation Schools.    Drawings of the various types of building of which the Local Uducation Authorities may desire to avail themselves have been obtained and are being kept in my Department for the inspection of the Authorities.The Committee which I have appointed to prepare a draft of a National Scheme of Training for the Sea Service ie now sitting under the Chairmanship of Sir Norman Hill.    This Committee consists of representatives from the Board of Education, the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Shipping respectively, and also of Shipowners, the Seamen1o and firemen1t Union,  duettion Authorities, and others interested in the matter.As might have been expected owing to the increased cost of living on the one hand, and the announcement of the Board&apos;e Supplementary Grant on the other, there have been differences of opinion on the question of salaries in various parts of the Country, but in every case they have either been amicably settled or are in process of settlement.The Strike of Teachers in the populous districts ofrCarmarthenshire, to which reference has been made in a previous Report, has been brought to an end and an agreement has been signed, on behalf of the Local Education Authority and of the Teachers, under which all matters in dieputo are to ee referred to an independent Arbitrator.In the email Urban District of Rowley Regie there was a Strike which lasted a few weeks hut hao now been Drought to an end by oonference between the parties.    A dispute in Leeda has been submitted to an independent Arbitrator, nominated by mc at the request of the Local Education Authority and Teaohers, and I3. understand
understand that his award has been issued.    I have boon anxiously watching the peaitien in London and I an glad to oay that the differencea between the Toachere and the Londan Caunty Cauncil have been settled without official intervention or reaort to arbitration,1, With the consent of the Treasury the Grants hitherto payableby my Department for Schools for Mothers are to be continued for another year and the Grants for Day Nurserioe, which have hitherto amounted to a little more than 25 per cent of the expenditure on maintenance of these Institutions, will in future be paid on a basil of 80 per cent of that expenditure.8* In order to meet the difficulties of soholars and othersattending Educational Institutions at a distance from their homes, the Board of Trade have sanctioned the issue of special Season Tickets for shortor periods corresponding to the length of sohool terms.    Theoe tickets will only be issued to bona fide teachers, students, or scholars and it is hoped that the concession will placs them in much the same position as they were in before the recent increases in the rates for Season Tiokets.9. The Education Sill has received the Royal Aosent,m8th August, 1918o
