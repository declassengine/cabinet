To consider any other proposals that may be brought forward.^-Statement by the Secretary.   (Appendix.)Naval History.Sir Julian Corbett said that he thought the difficulties which had. existed during Ihe earlier part of the war over the securing of papers had now been removed ; satis-factory arrangements had been made by the Admiralty by which all the papers necessary for continuing the history without a break would be accessible.The first volume of the naval history would most probably be ready for publication directly the war came to an end ; very little alteration was required in the text, and the maps were well in hand.Admiral Slade, who had read it, agreed that in his opinion it would require no material alteration.[650] B
Military History.Captain Atkinson said it was quite impossible to say when the first volume of the military history would be ready, as more information was continually coming in about the earlier operations.Admiral Slade said he thought there was no object in hurrying matters.Sir Maurice Hankey said that personally he had always been averse to publication until the end of the war. His feeling was that once the war came to an end they should be able to bring out the volumes fairly regularly, so that the public could be kept interested.Major Daniel pointed out that the proposal to publish before the close of the war did not come from the War Office, but was the personal suggestion of General Maurice. The Army Council were asked if they approved, and the reply was in the affirmative.It was decided to leave the matter open.General Radcliffe was not present during this discussion, but came in at a later stage of the proceedings, when Admiral Slade explained to him the position, and said that thy views of the Committee were against premature publication.General Radcliffe said he thought there was a great demand for the history for educational purposes, and that it would be useful for lectures in France during the winter, but as he was rather in. the dark as to the real nature of the history, he was willing to fall in with the views of the Committee, and would take an early opportunity of reading the revised draft to the end of the retreat from Mons.He understood the Director of Military Intelligence was anxious that the intelli-gence side of the operations should not be neglected.Admiral Slade and Sir Maurice Hankey also expressed their readiness to read it when copies were available.Captain Atkinson said that with regard to the maps a certain number had been prepared, but nothing had been settled as to the number that would be required.Admiral Slade thought a decision on this point should be come to as soon as possible, and that they should be got into the same state of readiness as the naval maps.Trade History.Admiral Slade said he had read two or three chapters of this history which appeared to be quite good, but rather heavy.Sir Julian Corbett said it had been found necessary to cut out a certain portion of this book, which would be dealt with in the history of the merchant navy. The submarine period, which would come later, would be much better and lighter. No doubt it would be a very valuable book.History of the Merchant Navy.Admiral Slade thought that the first volume of this work might with advantage be published as soon as possible after the war. He did not know, however, what was the scope of the book nor what material there was.Sir Maurice Hankey said he had talked the matter over with Mr. Hurd, and knew he intended to deal with the position of the mercantile marine before the war, and was anxious to show how much consideration had been given to its protection by the Government.Major Daniel said that it was intended to produce the book in two volumes. The work would embrace the organisation of the mercantile marine, its relations with the Admiralty, Board of Trade, Ministry of Shipping, and other Departments, and the service which it had rendered during- the war.Diary of the War.A bound copy of the diary for October 1914 was laid on the table.Admiral Slade said that the diary would be of enormous value for writing the more specialised staff histories, and he thought it should be set up in type after the war and issued as a confidential document to Government Departments. As it contained much confidential matter, mainly on the political side, it could not be published without very careful editing.Sir Julian Corbett said he had found it invaluable in preparing his interim history, and Sir Maurice Hankey said he had often had to refer to it.
IT. Air History.Admiral Slade said they were all very glad to welcome Sir Walter Raleigh as the prospective author of a history that would be both interesting and unique unique in the sense that no history of the kind had ever been written before.Sir Walter Raleigh : Almost too good a chance !Admiral Slade went on to say that the proposal was that this history should be brought out on the same lines as the other histories now being prepared. He supposed the Air Ministry were in agreement with the proposals, and that the staff asked for in Captain Fairbairn&apos;s report was absolutely necessary.Sir Julian Corbett said it appeared to him that there would be much leeway to be made up, and, if the book was to be got out quickly, Sir Walter Ilaleigh must have the information continually flowing in. If the staff were reduced, the results would be slower and the expense just as great.Colonel Davidson said that the Air Ministry were in entire agreement with the proposals. As regards the staff, the chief difficulty with the Air Force was that they had had so many changes, and the records existed at so many places, that the work of research would be much greater than in the case of the other histories. Moreover, each individval sent in a report (combat reports, reconnaissance reports, &amp;c), which was not so in the case of the military operations, where reports were sent in by units only. He was satisfied that the staff asked for was the minimum with which the work could be adequately carried out.Captain Fairbairn agreed. It was essential that one officer should reside at &quot;Blandford, which was a big records centre and was at a considerable distance from London. He hud been instructed by Major Daniel to go very carefully into the question of the staff, and to report what, in his opinion, was the absolute minimum that would be required.   This he had done.Sir Maurice Hankey said he was pleased when reading the Secretary&apos;s report to see what use was being made of light duty officers, and was in favour of getting whatever assistance we could in that way.Major Daniel said he hoped we might receive considerable assistance from light duty officers; these officers, unfortunately, could only be attached for a time, and generally had to return to their own units as soon as they had become an, fait with the work. What we required was a permanent staff who would not be subject to removal. It was only with such a staff that the work could be expeditiously and efficiently carried out.Admiral Slade said that he thought the whole success of the undertaking depended on the provision of an adequate staff for doing the spade work. The salaries of the staff should be on the same scale as those of the staff of the military history; that is, the officer in charge should receive 600Z. a year and his assistants 500L a year each.The Committee endorsed the proposals mentioned in paragraph 20 of Major DanieFs statement, and accepted Captain Fairbairns estimate of the minimum staff required, with salaries on the same scale as those of the military history staff.The Secretary was directed to write to the Treasury informing them of this decision and requesting their approval.III. Other Proposals. There were no further proposals.It was decided that the Secretary&apos;s statement and the Procee lings of this Committee should be circulated to the War Cabinet.
Memorandum on the Work of the Historical Section of the Committee ofImperial Defence.(Prepared by the Secretary.)A FULL statement showing the state of progress to the end of 1917 of the several histories in course of preparation was laid before the Committee at their last meeting. During the past six months the work has continued on the same lines as hitherto.Naval Branch.Naval History.2. Sir Julian Corbett has nearly completed his draft of the second volume which will bring the narrative to the middle of June 1915 for all theatres of operations.Arrangement of Papers.3. Home waters telegrams up to the 17th October, 1914, have been completed and bound in nineteen volumes. Those for the period ending the 16 th December are ready for binding in about twelve volumes.It has been found convenient to make collections of the weekly reports sent in by senior naval officers of the twenty-one patrol areas of home waters, as well as of the letters of proceedings of admirals abroad. It will probably be thought advisable to bind these for convenient periods as the numbers now missing are obtained.Preliminary narratives have been prepared for the principal spheres of active operations in foreign waters up to the middle of 1915, and for the areas in home waters to the end of May.The work of dealing with the papers has been so sub-divided that the staff has been able to keep ahead of Sir Julian Corbetfs requirements.General.4. In February Mr. Tuck spent ten days at Plymouth examining the records of the Commander-in-Chief for 1914 and 1915, and compiled a diary on the lines of that made by him at Portsmouth.5. Lieutenant Chatterton has made a chronological abstract of the auxiliary patrol service in relation to enemy&apos;s submarine and minelaying operations up to August 1915.6. With regard to the proposal brought forward at the last meeting of the Committee on the 7th February, 1918, that the official naval history should be published before the end of the war, in the opinion of the Admiralty the objections to publication before the end of the war outweigh any advantages to be gained thereby. The rigorous censorship that would be required would involve the suppression of so much matter that the book would appear in a form which could not be satisfactory either to the public or to the Committee.Military Branch.Military History.7. Mr. Fortescue has written the narrative of the Western front to the close of the second battle of Ypres. He has found it necessary to re-write the whole of the retreat from Mons in the light of additional information received, and will probably have to re-write the remaining portion of his first volume for the same reason. He has now been engaged for some months on the operations in the Eastern sphere, that is, Mesopotamia, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, East Africa, North-West Frontier of India, Egypt, and the Dardanelles, and has brought the narrative down to the 25th April landing in the Dardanelles. The narration of these operations will form the first part of his second volume.Preparation of Material.8. Since the date of the last report Captain Atkinson and Major Becke have been mainly occupied with filling in the gaps in the material for the operations in 1914. A great deal of information has been obtained from officers who took part in the earlyAPPENDIX.
stages of the campaign on the Western front, including many repatriated prisoners of war. This will be especially valuable for the purpose of a future Staff History and Training Manuals. Through the good offices of General Hanbury-Williams, who has been in charge of the interned prisoners of war in Holland, an arrangement has been made for the collection of information among them. This matter was taken in hand at first by Captain A. J. H. Maclean of Ardgour, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, to whom the branch is greatly indebted, and is now being continued by Captain R. Keppel, Coldstream Guards, and Captain J. F. H. Houldsworth, Gordon Highlanders.9. Another feature of the last six months has been the compilation for the Adjutant-General of short narratives of the services of the 140 service and second line territorial battalions disbanded early this year. This involved the reading of some thousands of diaries, as several of the battalions had been nearly three years in France. The information was required by the Adjutant-General for the purpose of sending to the Lords-Lieutenant of counties and to Mayors of towns from which these battalions were recruited letters expressing the Army Council&apos;s appreciation of the services rendered by these units.10. Major Thomas and Captain Bell have been making progress with the diaries of the early part of 1916.General11. The administrative work of the branch continues to increase, and it has only been possible to keep up with it by obtaining the assistance of officers unfit for general service.12. Particular mention should be made of Captain R. L. Atkinson, M.C., the Queens Regiment, whose work has been invaluable. This officer was also of great assistance in preparing the narratives mentioned above for the Adjutant-General. Captain C. A. L. Brownlow, D.S.O., R.F.A., has also rendered, valuable assistance, but has now been passed fit for general service.13. Lieutenant C. 0. G. Douie, Dorsetshire Regiment, who was with the branch in 1917, has rejoined for a short period, and application is being made by the War Office for other officers to be attached.14. At the last meeting of the Committee it was decided to recommend that the salaries of Major A. F. Becke and Captain J. J. Bell should be raised from 300Z. to 500L per annum.   This increase was sanctioned by the Treasury on the 11th March.15. The proposal that the first volume of the Official Military History should be issued to the public as soon as it is ready, and not necessarily after the conclusion of peace, has been agreed to by the Army Council, but since it will be necessary to rewrite a considerable portion of this narrative in view of information obtained from liberated officers and others, it is impossible to name an approximate date by which this volume will be ready for the publishers.History of the Effect of Naval Operations on Seaborne Trade.16. The draft of Volume I has been revised in accordance with suggestions made by Sir Julian Corbett, and Volume II is now in course of preparation.Mr. Fayle wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to Captain Clement J^ones, Assistant-Secretary to the War Cabinet; Lieutenant-Colonel T. H. Hawkins, C.M.G., and Sir Frederick Bolton, of the Ministry of Shipping ; Sir Norman Hill and Mr. John Hilton, his colleague at the Garton Foundation, all of whom have placed much valuable material at his disposal.History of the Merchant Navy in the War.17. This work, which is being written by Mr. Archibald Hurd, is progressing satisfactorily. The summaries of actions between submarines and merchant ships for which decorations have been conferred are almost complete, and the narrative of the Auxiliary Patrol has been brought down to the end of 1914. The record of the attacks upon hospital ships to the spring of the current year has been drafted. Mr. Hurd has also written the preliminary matter dealing with Admiralty measures for the protection of merchant shipping and the organisation of the Trade Division of the Admiralty.Diary of the War, with Monthly Summary.18. The military section is complete up to July 1915, and the political section up to the end of October 1915.   The naval diary has been written up to the end of [650J &apos;       . C
January 1915, and the succeeding months are well in hand. In future it is hoped to make more rapid progress with this section.The blockade section, which is finished to the end of June 1915, has now been taken over by Mr. R. de B. Layard, C.M.G.The value of the diary has been recognised by every person to whom it has been shown.Air History.19. It has long been recognised that after the conclusion of peace there is certain to be a strong public demand for an authentic account of the airman&apos;s part in the war, and when the Royal Air Force was formed in April 1918 by the amalgamation for administrative purposes of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps, it was considered that the time was opportune to move in the matter.By direction of Admiral Slade, and with the approval of Sir Maurice Hankey, I at once got into communication with the Air Ministry, and on the 7th May the Secretary wrote to say that the Air Council were in complete agreement with the proposals I had formulated regarding an Official History of the Eoyal Air Force, with which would be incorporated the war history of the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps. The first matter for decision the choice of a suitable author presented some difficulty. Several names were considered, and eventually Sir Walter Raleigh, Professor of English Literature at Oxford, who was recommended by the President of the Board of Education, was selected. This selection has the entire approval of the Air Council, the Chairman of the History of the War Committee, and the Secretary to the War Cabinet. .20. The conditions on which it is proposed that the work shall be carried out, and in which Sir Walter Raleigh concurs, are: (a.) The production shall be superintended by the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence in concert with the History of the War Committee.(6.) The Air Ministry shall supply the material and afford the author every facility to carry out his task.(c.) Sir Walter Raleigh shall devote the greater part, amounting to about four-fifths, of his time to the history.(d.) Sir Walter Raleigh&apos;s remuneration shall be a salary at the rate of 800L per annum.(e.) The history shall be published by the Clarendon Press, and shall be on the same lines as the other Official Histories in course of preparation, the copyright being vested in the Kings printer.21. Sir Walter Baleigh&apos;s salary has been sanctioned by the Treasury.   .Prepai^ation of Material.22. The main consideration now is the provision of an adequate staff to collect and arrange material. In order to enable the Committee to come to a decision on this point, by the courtesy of the Air Ministry the services of Captain C. Fairbairn, R.A.F., have been placed at my disposal. This officer has already obtained a large amount of valuable information, and at my request has furnished a Report, which I give in full :-&quot; Air Ministry, July 18, 1918. &quot; As instructed, I beg to submit the following Beport upon the proposed Air Historv.   I have divided this into sections as follows: &quot;I. The whereabouts of all records likely to be of service.&quot; II. The staff necessary to carry out the duties of the collection and collationof the material. &quot; III.. General summary.&quot; I. Records.&quot; As is well known, the present Royal Air Force is a combination of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps. It will, therefore, be obvious that prior to the fusion of these two services, separate records were kept, and that in
order to obtain the information from which the proposed air history will be written, it will be necessary to search all records kept by both forces ; and, in addition, the early records kept by the Admiralty and the Royal Engineers.&quot; The whole of the necessary information exists at the following places : &quot; The Royal Engineers&apos; Records Office, Chatham.&quot; The Royal Engineers&apos; Library and Records Room, Whitehall.&quot; The Admiralty.&quot; Blandford.&quot; The Air Ministry.&quot; In Section III will be found details of those records, and suggestions as to how they should be dealt with.&quot; ll-Staf.&quot; For reasons advanced in Section III, a staff of nine persons appears necessary to assist the author, consisting of &quot; One officer in charge of staff. &quot; Three assistant officers or civilians. &quot; One staff sergeant or senior clerk. &quot; Two assistant clerks. &quot; Two shorthand typists.&quot;III. General Summary.&quot; It will be apparent that to enable the author to plan the form of his proposed work, he must be in possession of all available information before the commencement of the actual writing.&quot; The selected author expressed a desire to obtain in the first place the very earliest history of kite ballooning, and flying before even the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps were created.&quot; It was found that a very complete account exists of this early period in the Royal Engineers&apos; records at Chatham and at the A.dmiralty, and a great deal of additional and most interesting information can be obtained from officers who were connected with these units from their commencement.&quot; From the dates of the creation of the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps complete records exist, the former at the Admiralty and the latter at Blandford and the Air Ministry.&quot;Records of events since the amalgamation of these services into the Royal Air Force are all at the Air Ministry.Employment of Staff.&quot;It is suggested that the Officer i/c Staff shall be constantly employed at the Historical Section Offices in Whitehall Gardens, and shall have one officer or civilian to assist him.&quot; In addition, it will be necessary to have one officer or civilian attached to the office, whose duty it will be to search the existing files and collect all information from the various records in London ; and also one other officer or civilian to reside permanently at Bhmdford to forward information from that source.&quot; Regarding the subordinate staff, two assistant clerks should suffice, working under an efficient staff sergeant or senior clerk, whose duties would be the filing, card-indexing, &amp;c, of all information collected by the officers.&quot; It is practically impossible at this stage to make an accurate forecast of the amount of correspondence necessitated by the work, but two shorthand-typists should be able to cope with it, at any rate in the preliminary stages.&quot;It would be of great benefit if, during a pressure of work, officers of the Royal Air Force on light duty could be loaned from time to time.Plan of Operations.&quot; Upon the offices becoming available, it is suggested that the procedure should be as follows : &quot; That the Officer i/c Staff and his assistant, together with the subordinate staff, shall at once commence to file and record the information already[650] D
available (a separate report on the suggested system to be adopted is being prepared), and the officer or civilian attached to this office shall at (nice proceed to collect what information is necessary from the London records; and also the officer or civilian who will eventually permanently reside at Blandford, shall proceed to Chatham and remain there until lie has forwarded all the information desired from the Royal Engineers&apos; records.&quot;Sir Walter Raleigh is in entire agreement with the above suggestions.23. I strongly recommend that Captain Eairbairn, who has a thorough knowledge of the Air Service, be appointed to take charge of the Air Branch Staff&quot;.24. Arrangements have been made for Sir Walter Raleigh to visit the various aviation centres in France early in August, in order that he may gain a knowledge of the working of the Air Force at first hand.25. I wish to bring to the notice of the Committee the ready assistance given at all points by Colonel E. H. Davidson, Deputy Director of Air Intelligence.General,Medical History of the War.26. Though the Medical History of the War is not a matter that directly concerns the History of the War Committee, it may be of interest to record the progress that has been made with this history, which is being prepared by Major F. S. Brereton, R.A.M.C., a member of this Committee.Major Brereton has now received about 30,000 diaries. These have come from France, Salonica, Egypt, Mesopotamia, East Africa, West Africa, the Dardanelles, and also from Samoa and Tsingtau. The abstracting of these diaries, until a few weeks ago, was done by himself, and the present position is as follows: (a.) French Fronts.-Abstracts for all diaries for 1914, 1915, and 1916, up to and inclusive of a portion of the Battle of the Somme, completed and typed in duplicate.(b.) Dardanelles. Abstracts completed and typed.(c.) Suez Canal Defence Force. Abstracts completed for 1914, 1915, and 1916,including the Senussi Campaign and other operations with desert troops, (d.) West Africa. Material is practically ready for writing up. (e.) Palestine. Diaries in course of being abstracted.The diaries from the remaining theatres have not yet been touched.In addiiion, a large amount of material, giving details as to ambulance trains, hospital ships, &amp;c, has been collected and filed. Major Brereton has a useful collection of photographs which he has taken on the French and Italian fronts.Major Brereton has written up a certain amount of the history with a view to providing a popular narrative of the Royal Army Medical Corps. He has also written a number of articles for propaganda purposes, which have been published in Scandi-navian countries, America, &amp;c.There is also an Art and Museum Section, with three studios and a number pf artists, who are preparing paintings, models, plans, &amp;c, for the Medical Museums.French Naval Historical Section.27. With reference to the request of the French Ministry of Marine, which was considered at the last meeting of the Committee, that the working of the Naval Branch of the Historical Section might be explained to them, in February last the French Naval Attache, Contre-Amiral Mercier eta Lostende, K.C.M.G., C.B., and Capitaine de Fregate Comte de Douville Maillefeu, C.M.G., called at Whitehall Gardens, and were made acquainted with the functions and. working of the Historical Section in general, and the Naval Branch in particular, and were shown the system of dealing: with the various documents.Amiral de Lostende said that practically nothing had been done in France on the preparation and arrangement of material for a naval history from the French point of view, and it w^s unlikely that anything would be done before the close of the war. The Naval Historical Section in Paris consisted of a secretary and a clerk, just as did the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence at the commencement of the preseut war. On the question of interchange of information being mentioned, Comte de Douville Maillefeu said he had been told that the policy of the British Admiralty
was not to divulge any secret information until after the war, and in any case there could not at present be any interchange of information, as the Erench Historical Section had nothing to give.Both French officers expressed themselves thoroughly satisfied with what they saw, and were astonished at the magnitude of the work. They said they would send in a report of their visit to the French Ministry of Marine, and recommend that the French Naval Historical Section should be now expanded and developed on similar lines to the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence.They further expressed a hope that, in the event of this being decided on, an officer on its stall&apos; would be permitted to come over and study our system and organisation in greater detail.United Slates.28. The Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence is also in communication with the American naval and militaiy authorities with the same object.E. Y.
