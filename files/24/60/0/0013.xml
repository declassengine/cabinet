(this doomwrnt la the propwty of572nd august,!918,lemorandum o^the reported oil fieldsof mesopotamia and part of -persiathe following remarks are based on german reports in the earlier part of the present century and recent reports by geologists sent to examine some of the oil occurrences by the anglo-persian oil company on behalf of the military authorities,the petroleum zone of mesopotamia extends aver a distance of about 650 miles north and south with a minimum width.of 80 miles, giving an area of about 50,000 square miles.    over this vast region oil is worked in a large number of hand dug pits and&quot;there are countless seepages and other signs of the presence of petroleum,all deposits of petroleum in mesopotamia belong &quot;civil list&quot; properties of the sultan and whento the they are worked lessees,are leased by that department to thethe most northern indication of oi? with which this paper deals is that at zakha,about 60 riles N.e;W. of mossul,     it is an important seepage worked by natives and there are said to be 30 hand dug pits from which an oil of good quality of about .9 specific gravity is obtained.the group of seepages in the neighbourhood of el g-ayara about 50 miles south of mossul are reported to . be the most important of all in this region.   - they are leased to natives from the turkish crown at a rental of  t250 a year.     oil is being produced in moderate, quantities and has been so produced for ages.     it is of good quality with about ,8 specific gravity.oil indications occur on both banks of the, tigris between this place and sl fat ha;, 50 miles further,, down the river.     the seepages there are stated to be very   * important.there are strong indications c:r&apos; oil at kirkuk, &apos; while at gull the present putput from the seepages is 3 barrels a day and from tiz kermatie it is 4 barrels. between both these places there are numerous oil shows. this region is reported to be very rich in oil.at kifri there is,in addition to an important oil seepage, a large outcrop of natural gas.     coal is also found in this neighbourhood,the oil is refined in rough native stills.the group in the mendali-iqianikin district is -extremely important and promises to give several very prolific oilfields.     they are mostly within the existing concession of the anglo-persian oil company ltd.and have&quot;been/
been examined more or less in detail by their geologists. at chia surk a field has been opened, bat when&quot;the field at maidan-i-naftiin &quot;//as discovered, the former was abandoned on account of the greater accessibility of the wells of the latter to the coast,a report dated march 1918 on naft ehana by one of the company1 s geologists states that &quot;the naft khana oilfield so nearly approached ideal conditions that it must be regarded as an area of greatest promise %    the dome is said to be 10 miles long so that the reservoir of oil is probably very large.    at the request of the military authorities, the company&apos;is arranging to drill on this area as soon as the plant can be transported to the spot.the field at abi g-hilan is also reported to be of great promise.the two fields marked in the pasht-i-kuh district at deh luran and dalpari also show very favourable indications and it is intended to drill on them as soon as other development work permits.    there are besides these, other favourable indications between deh luran and naft khana*the fv-roup of oil occurrences in the bamadi-hit district on the euphrates have been examined by the anglo-persian oil company geologist, who reports as follows :.-&quot;there is, therefore, three parts of a dome whose sides dip at a few feet to the nile only.    big productions have been obtained from similar structure in the united states,     the gas pressure and large extent of the seepages though not necessarily implying a rood production of as haltic oil from drilled wells, must be taken as exceedingly favourable evidence   ,a considerable amount of oil is being obtained from hand dug wells and there is a lake of bitumen containing go,000 tons of this material.     it is probable that this region also will develop into a prolific field.a german paper on the subject of the importance of mesopotamia,written in 1916 has the following statement:- &quot;the greatest importance after that cf the suez canal.attaches to the possession of mesopotamia and especially to  he southern border province of turkey and the persian provinces of lurisban and susiana **** :;&apos; &apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;* here, moreover, between xasr-i-schirin in persia and kerkuh in turkey, on one side,and the towns of chusistan, ahwaz. and ram hoiwaz on the other are petroleum wells known for thousands of years ********* a;     the author then proceeds to show the great importance of petroleum as fuel for the future.
