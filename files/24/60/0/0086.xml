Chamberlain.)I have juot read the Eemo, of Mr, Chamberlain on the above matter (G0T.5348).     It so happens that I heard of the proposal that medals should be issued to Australian, New Zealand and New-foundland troops and not to the others, and had been in communi-cation with certain people about it,     I heard of it from a man who was in Glasgow on Sunday, 4th. instant, and found that it was much commented upon there,     I also heard of it from Man-Chester,   I came in contact with a young officer who stayed with me this weekend on his way through to Glasgow, and who had b en through the campaign; and from all that I could gather, there is a pretty wide-spread feeling about the proposal to give to some and not to others;     and I heartily support i;.v, Chr-u-iberlain In the view he puts forward in the paper G.T.5348.
