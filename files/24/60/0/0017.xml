The Committee on Production have awarded varying sums to employees in different trades although the cause of such awards, i.e.- the increased cost of living, is the same to all grades of employees.     The awards appear to be based upon a policy of expediency as distinct from any mathematical or scientific calculation applicable to the increased cost- of living stated from time to &quot;time in the Board of Trade Labour Gazette;   and that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Prime Minister, the war Cabinet, the Local Government Board, the Chief Industrial Commissioner, the Chairman of the Committee on Production^ the Minister of Munitions of tar and the Member of Parliament for the Borough.&quot;I amSir,Your ob$&amp;X*n* &quot;Servant, (Signed).  tfOHIT HASLAM.TOWN CLERK.The Secretary,The War Cabinet, Whitehall,London, S.W.1
