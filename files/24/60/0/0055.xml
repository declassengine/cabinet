Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)

G.T.5355

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 7th August, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Ninety-three applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to days, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£60,326.

COMPULSORY TILLAGE- WORK OF INSPECTORS.

The majority of the Department&apos;s Tillage Inspectors have been recently engaged in completing the inspection of cases in which the Department were obliged to enter on the lands of occupiers who failed to cultivate in accordance with the provisions of the Tillage Orders, and set portion of the lands for cultivation in conacre (i.e. the letting of the lands for one season for the growing of a Tillage crop). The Inspectors report that on the whole the crops grown by the Department&apos;s conacre tenants have been well cultivated and are of good promise.

A Conference of the Department&apos;s Tillage Inspectors was held during the week, at which several matters affecting the work of the Inspectors were discussed. The procedure to be adopted as regards the further action to be taken in cases in which the Department had entered on lands was settled, and there was also a general discussion on other important points affecting the future working of the Tillage Scheme, such as, the future cultivation of lands which prior to the season 1916-17 had been practically all in grass; the question of drainage and improvement of land generally", the question of labour for the forthcoming harvest, etc.

FLAX.

Flax pulling operations will be general in most districts this week.

The flax crop is extremely variable, and on the whole appears to be under average. In several counties the crop is very poor, but in parts of Counties; Antrim, Derry, and Down, it is superior to the 1917 crop, "Firing" of "Drowning" (a disease which seriously affects the yield and quality of both the fibre and the seed) is very prevalent.

In almost all parts of the country farmers are well disposed towards compliance with the Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918, and many of then will save a larger amount of need than is required under the Order.

The dissatisfaction among flaxgrowers regarding the award of the Board of Arbitration appointed by the Ministry of Labour as to Wages for pulling and handling flax, has become more intense, and some growers who have poor crops do not purpose to pull their flax, as they

7/8/18.


 consider that the value of the crop would not warrant the expenditure that would be incurred in paying the workers wages for carrying out the necessary operations. Several strikes of workers required for the pulling   and after-treatment of the flax crop have been reported. The Department have called an urgent special meeting of their Advisory Committee on Flax Growing to consider the position in view of the labour trouble which threatens to become general.

PROGRESS OF CROPS.

Root crops generally have been improved by the recent rains, though in many districts turnips are reported as patchy. Thinning is now practically completed and attention is being given to final weeding and "scuffling".    On many farms corn crops are just on the "turn" and early sown fields of winter wheat will be ready for cutting immediately. The cutting of the oat crop has commenced in certain counties. Reports of "lodging" in the richer soils have been received. In some districts there is still some old meadow hay to be cut and saved. The potato crop generally looks well, but blight has made its appearance in several counties on unsprayed areas.   Properly sprayed crops are still generally unaffected. A third application of the spraying mixture is being given on some farms. Pastures everywhere are again affording a full bite for stock, and the improvement has been reflected in increased milk yields.

Inquiries for seed for catch crops are numerous, and merchants are laying in stocks. A large area of land in Co. Limerick has been sown under rape.

SUPPLIES OF ARTIFICIAL MANURES.

A scheme for the allocation of supplies of Sulphate of Ammonia available for the season 1918-19 among retail traders throughout the country have been completed by the Fertilisers Allocation Committee of the Department,   It was found that the applications for supplies from these traders exceeded the total quantity allotted to Ireland by some thousands of tons, and individual applications had to be cut down accordingly, though the orders of small traders were met in full as far as a possible. In selecting the importing centre from which traders should secure their supplies regard was had to the necessity for economising railway haulage and reducing transit charges.

CATTLE FEEDING STUFFS.

A conference was held at Liverpool during the week between representatives of the Ministry of Food, the Department, the Liverpool Port Feeding Stuffs Committee and the leading Irish importers, with a view to having the shipment of feeding cakes and meals to Ireland placed on a proper basis. The allocation to Ireland of a definite percentage of available supplies was agreed upon, the Department under-taking to arrange a Scheme for the distribution of the feeding stuffs in Ireland to suit the requirements of the country, with the least possible disturbance of existing trade interests.
