Dr. J. Dixon, 0.B, E., has been appointed assistant secretary to the Committee.Several, meetings of the Committee have been held for the consideration of the programmes of the various Executives,, with a view to presenting a provisional complete programme to the Allied Food Controllers at the end of the present week.Wheat Executive. The Earl of Crawford and Balcarres has been nominated as British representative on this Executive in place of Sir John Beale, and. at a meeting of the Executive/held on August 7, he was elected to the chair on the motion of Professor&quot; Attolico, seconded by Major Fillioux and supported by Mr. Jackson.Meat and Fats Executive. The Executive expect that it will be necessary to reduce the frozen meat demand by a total of at least 15,000 or 20 000 tons&apos;a month, as they are informed that, together with the probable requirements of the American Army, the amount required would more than absorb all the available refrigerated tonnage, assuming that it could lie used continuously to the best advantage. They are also of the opinion that the deficiency cannot be made up by an increase of preserved meat since the available supplies of this commodity would also appear to be less than the total demand.Supplies and Pricks.Bacon, Rams and Lard. Protests against the maximum retail prices fixed by the Bacon, Ham and Lard (Prices) Order, 1918, have been received from trade associations in Scotland. The Divisional Food Commissioner, Edinburgh, also suggests revision of these prices, and they aie being re-examined. Minor alterations may be required in England also.In accordance with the request of the Food Control Committee for Ireland, 1,100 boxes of American bacon have been released for export. The shortage is still fairly acute in Ireland, and it is anticipated that further licences for export will be granted.Butter. The Butter Order, 1918. dated olst July, 1918, comes into force on 7th August, and supersedes the previous orders regulating butter prices. The maximum retail price for any butter, British made or Government, will, until further notice, be 2s. M. per lb. The maximum prices at which British-made butter may be sold by a maker or blender to a retailer will be 2s. Id. for butter sold in bulk.The Food Controller has issued a direction prohibiting anyone from selling Government butter by wholesale after August 17th, except under licence.Canned Salmon. Arrangements have been made to release 9,960 cases from imported stocks of canned salmon to the British Prisoners of War CommittedCereals. It is understood that the Select Committee on National Expenditure have considered the additional evidence given in regard to the bread subsidy and will present their report at an early date.Cocoa. Shipment of 2,000 tons of raw cocoa from the Gold Coast has been reported, and further ships are now loading at various West African ports.Dried Fruits. Telegrams have been received from Greece under the insurance scheme saying that two other ships are being loaded with Greek currants for this country. About 1,000 tons.of currants have been despatched from Greece for traii-shipment via Marseilles and Naples.300 tons of currants, raisins, and sultanas have been released to the Director-General of Voluntary Organisations for making plum-puddings for the troops.A  (83)6275-2   Pk ]   135  8/18  E &amp; S A
Further releases of currants have been made to the Navy, and the Navy and Army Canteen Board. &apos;   %Reports from Spain show that the crop of Valencia raisins will be very small  only 8,000 tons, and the War Office will want practically the whole of this quantity for the troops in France. The Malaga crop of raisins and the Spanish and Portuguese crops of figs promise well. Good reports have also been received of the new Greek currant crop.Meat.--The population is still being fed mainly on home-grown meat, although the supply of sheep and still more that of cattle have been checked both by the recent rains, which have given the farmers every encouragement to hold back their stock in order to add to its weight, and also by the demands of the harvest on the limited amount of labour available. The proportion of home-grown meat ranged last week from 66 per cent, to 98 per cent, except in the case of the Home Counties and Metropolitan Area, where considerably under 50 per cent, was furnished from home-grown stock.It appears that total consumption falls far short of the full ration allowed, and this constitutes a strong case for reducing the present scale.The only difficulty now experienced with regard to distribution, which may otherwise be regarded as satisfactory, is in catering at holiday resorts.The condition in.which imported meat arrives in this country is still below the required standard, but complaints are less numerous than before, as greater care is now taken in inspecting meat before issue.A meeting of persons interested in the pig trade has been held at the Ministry of Food, and a resolution in favour of the control of the sale of pigs was passed by a large majority.Milh.--&apos;l&apos;he Sub-Committee of Major Astor&apos;s Committee on the Production and Distribution of Milk, appointed to advise the Food Controller as to the winter prices of milk, has now completed its work. The Sub-Committee recommends by a majority that the producers&apos; price for the months October 1918 to April 1919 inclusive shall be 2s. 3d. per Imperial gallon. Its report will be considered on August 9th by the parent committee, who will forward recommendations to the Food Controller.Potatoes. The details of the new Potato Distribution Scheme .have now been settled, and will, as promised, be announced in Parliament before the recess.A meeting of the Central Agricultural Advisory Council to the Boards of Agri-culture and the Ministry of Food was held on 6th August, Lord Selborne in the chair. Two members of the Council were appointed to represent producers upon the Home Cereals Committee; it was resolved that the President of the Board of Agri-culture be requested to communicate with all other Government Departments which fix the price of agricultural products, and to request them to give this Council an early opportunity of expressing its views before they proceed to fix such prices. A resolution was also passed requesting the Army Council not to fix the 1918 price of hay below si. per ton without previously consulting the Council. The proposed scheme for dealing with the 1918 crop of potatoes was explained to the Council.Organised Distribution.Rationing. [t has been decided that a half coupon shall be available for the purchase of butcher&apos;s meat from a retailer as well as for the purchase of a meat meal from a caterer. It is, of course, a condition of this concession that the amount of meat purchased on a half coupon shall be only half the amount which may be purchased-on a whole coupon. The demand for this concession is in respect of those classes of meat such as poultry, game and offal, for which there is a high coupon value;District Reports.-The Commissioner for the North-Western Division draws attention to the energy displayed in the county of Lancashire to increase food pro-cluction. The county was originally asked to break up 60,000 acres of grass land for the 1918 crop, the Board of Agriculture considering this an impossible task, reduced the figure to 40,000 acres. The land actually ploughed and planted showed an increase, however, of 72,097 acres over that of 1916, and 56,813 acres more than in 1917.In the East of Scotland the Food Control Committees in co-operation with various local Agricultural and Womens&apos; Organisations have been the means of large quantities

A recently married couple obtained three cards by filling in one with the maiden name of the wife.   A fine of 501. was imposed on the man, and !b5L on his wife.PA LIT II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.Receipts of cereals in July were below anticipation and smaller than in June. Compared with July 1917 only rice showed an increase, while the decrease in wheat, including wheaten flour, was approximately two-thirds. On the other hand, imports of butchers&apos; meat and bacon were above estimate, and in the case of the latter above the June figure. Arrivals were low of both butter and lard, but particularly of the former, less than 3,000 tons of which was received nearly all in the first week of the month. Sugar improved greatly on recent months, though the total was no larger than a year ago.In the week ending August 3rd the aggregate quantity of the principal foods and feeding stuffs received (excluding beverages) was practically the same as in the previous week, namely, 187,100 tons; in the corresponding week of 1917 the total was 297,000 tons (Table A).Wheat and flour together were 73,000 tons against 69,800 tons in the previous week. This apparent increase is turned into a decrease of 4,300 tons on the con-version into equivalent grain owing to the smaller proportion of flour in this week&apos;s import. The increased tendency to import flour rather than grain was valuable during the difficult period when it was essential that every ton of shipping should carry the maximum possible quantity of food for human consumption, but now that the situation is a little easier, a reversion to the former practice of importing grain to be milled in this country has compensations in that the millers&apos; offals&apos;set free in the process are urgently required to relieve the shortage of feeding stuffs for animals. Higher arrivals of barley raised the aggregate for &quot; other cereals &quot; slightly above that of the week before, but apart from rice the quantities received were not satisfactory.of fruit being collected, which would not otherwise have reached the jam niannfao-       % turers.  These firms,have given their assistance to the movement, and it is estimated that there will be very little waste of this season&apos;s fruit in the division.Enforcement of Orders.There were 584 more prosecutions this week than last, the total for England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland being 1,410.Ninety per cent, of the cases resulted in convictions, as against 93 per cent, in the previous week.England sent 1,151 cases       -        -    91 per cent, convictions. Scotland  ,,     24   ,, -        -  100Wales 72   ,, 1   -   91     ,, ,,Ireland    ,,    163   ,, -        -    85     ,, ,,The Divisions which sent in the largest number of cases were : Divisions. Prosecutions. Convictions.
The total for beef, mutton, and unspecified meat, 5,600 tons, was the lowest for any week since January. Bacon and hams fell over 8,u00 tons to 13,300 tons; the reduced quantity received is amply sufficient to meet requirements.The practical cessation of butter imports during recent weeks should be purely temporary and is to be attributed to alterations in the shipping programme rather than to any failure of supplies at tho source.   Cheese rose to 4,700 tons.Importations of sugar are normally heavy at this season of the year ; during the week under review they increased to 53,500 tons. If an adequate reserve is to be secured for the winter, arrivals must continue on a large scale for some time to come. The import of tea was the smallest for five months ; owing to the heavy arrivals of previous weeks a set-back in any one week is of little importance.Consumption.Meat. Provisional estimates of the number of fat stock stalled at markets during the week ended July 27th are given in Table l!. The total for fat cattle was the same as in the previous week ; fat sheep increased 10 per cent.Considerable variations have taken place during recent months in the quantities of imported meat consumed by civilians. As compared with 4,100 tons, the average weekly consumption for last year, the figure for May of this year was 5,700 tons, and that for June 8,300 tons. The amounts distributed during each of the four weeks to July 27th were 7,600 tons, 6,700 tons, 5,500 tons and 7,200 tons, respectively.Fish.-The quantity of fish passing through Billingsgate Market during the week ending August 3rd was 2,766 tons, compared with 2,908 tons in the week before and with 2,625 tons in the corresponding week of last year. This is the first week during the past two months in which a comparison with 1917 has been favourable to 1918. The average weekly figures for the first seven months of the year with corresponding figures for the two previous years are shown below :   r	January.	February.	March.	April.	May.	June.
