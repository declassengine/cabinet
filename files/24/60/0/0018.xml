Foreign Oitk e,United States /004.MEMORANDUMonWAR TRADE ORGANISATION IN THE UNITED STATES.THE following memorandum on war trade organisation in the United States has been furnished to the Foreign Office by Lord Reading as the first of a series of reports on the activities of the various departments and boards of the United States Government connected with war preparations.The Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office has recently circulated two memoranda on the United States and the Economic Defensive. This memorandum by Lord Reading gives the actual machinery at the disposal of the United States Government for carrying out any Allied policy which may be deter-mined on. It also indicates forcibly the one obstacle we have to surmount in securing the full co-operation of the United States namely, the vague suspicions afloat in various quarters in both countries as to trade matters.These suspicions have recently been publicly voiced in the United States. As an instance, the following extract from a leading article in the &quot; New York Journal of Commerce &quot; of the 18th June may be usefully quoted: &quot; There is in some minds at the present time a certain feeling that some of the countries engaged in war have been disposed, so far as practicable, to conserve their own position and resources in world trade with a view to the future. Some foreign commercial interests quite clearly feel that the United States, for example, should contribute not only to the actual cost of the war, but to the maintenance of relationships as they existed before the war, or at least, at the time of our entrance into it. This is a point of view that cannot, of course, be accepted by Americans in general^ and least of all by those who believe that the interests at stake are greater in the case of European countries than in that of the United States. When the United States contributes its means and adds its force to the other Allies most Americans feel that such action should not exempt them from the fullest measure of sacrifice, but should be regarded as an additional contribution originating with the United States. They instinctively hold that our resources should at least not be employed in such a way as to place our merchants or manufacturers at a disadvantage in international competition either now or after the war is over. This feeling has a sound human basis, besides being founded upon general considerations ofequity.....The people are undoubtedly willing to go to any lengthnecessary for the sake of winning the war: but they must be assured that what they sacrifice is devoted specifically to that purpose, and is not used for the sake of promoting either the commercial power or the individual pecuniary advantage of others.&quot;Again, on the 9th July, the same journal referred to suspicions that American loans to the Allies were not being wholly expended by them on war purchases in the United States itself, and remarked that &quot; It is the function of our statesmen to draw the line sharply and clearly between making provision for the military needs of those Governments which are associated with us in the war and assisting their commercial and financial interests to place upon cur people burdens which they should bear themselves.&quot;More important, however, than such press comments are the feelings of one or two officials in Washington-particularly Mr. Baruch, chairman of the War Industries Board, and Mr. Hurley, chairman of the Shipping Board. They have no definite charges against us-nothing that at present admits of refutation or reply. But at root their feelings are those of the article just quoted a feeling that we are calling upon the United States more and more for contributions towards the war,[367-31] B
and that, while we are thus dependent upon them for our very existence, we are turning our thoughts to the means of recapturing in post helium trade the leader-ship which we have lost in war finance and economics. They feel about us, in short, what we have often felt about France.- Lord Heading warns us against indulging in counter-accusations, however well justified, and the warning is obviously wise; but in view of the growing popular agitation here with regard to post helium trade matters, it may be somewhat difficult to follow his advice that less publicity should be given to our policy in such matters.In these circumstances, some of our American friends have been urging Mr. Bariich and Mr. Hurley to visit this country in order to ascertain for themselves how baseless their suspicions are. These friends of ours feel, too, and have pointed out at Washington, that the true remedy for these suspicions lies in a fuller exchange between the two Governments of detailed information as to present action and future plans. Their efforts have met with some success. They believe that they have secured a promise from Mr. Hurley that he will very shortly visit this country, and, in connection with pending discussions on raw materials and the work of the new Programme Committees, they have induced Mr. Baruch to send over his chief assis-tant, Mr. Summers. They hope that the work of the Programme Committees will, if the results of their deliberations can be conveyed with sufficient force and clearness to the right authorities at Washington, go far to supply the need of more detailed-mutual information.Mr. Summers&apos; visit is thus of quite peculiar importance. Lord Reading has, by telegraph, recommended us to receive him as cordially as possible, and to make the most of his presence here.A study of American opinion on the one hand, and British opinion on the other, at the present moment cannot fail to force on any observer the conclusion that an attempt to burke the problems of commerce after the war is now impossible; but that, on the other hand, the policy and public sentiment of the two countries are now in essence so nearly harmonious that we can, without injury to ourselves, make these very problems the basis of the Anglo-American post helium. Entente, which is our central political aim. We can at one and the same time satisfy the public demand for a forward policy and eliminate the international jealousies now un-fortunately bound up with that demand, by giving to our next forward .step the character of a frank business consultation with the United States.WAR TRADE.The United States authorities have not yet succeeded in co-ordinating the operations of the various Departments engaged in handling questions affecting their war trade policy, though the chairman of the War Trade Board, Mr. Vance McCormick, is making every effort to improve matters in this respect. Divergence of methods, though not ultimately of policy, have been particularly noticeable between the War Industries Board and the War Trade Board. This has arisen to a large extent from the absence, until quite recently, of any recognised demarcation of the responsible jurisdiction of these Boards over imported raw materials. An attempt has been made to remove this difficulty by concentrating in the hands of the chairman of the War Industries Board the control and distribution of all imported raw materials as well as of ail native raw materials, so that questions relating to the importation and utilisation of raw materials furnished by the British Empire are now handled by Mr. Baruch instead of by the War Trade Board as formerly. A statement as to the extended powers of Mr. Baruch has been forwarded in a separate despatch. It may be observed here briefly that as one of the first steps in the exercise of its functions of conserving and distributing industrial materials, the War Industries Board have practically taken over from the Bureau of Imports of the War Trade Board the effective control of all foreign raw materials of which there is likely to be a general shortage. These include wool, tin, tungsten, platinum, and may shortly include rubber and other commodities, the available supplies of which are limited through a lack of transportation facilities. A separate bureau has been created in the War Industries Board to study the situation in respect of each of these materials and to determine the facts upon which negotiations with foreign Governments must he based. The chiefs of these bureaux do not appear to have been selected with special regard to their expert knowledge of the particular
377commodities with, which they deal, and they are therefore obliged to rely upon the advice of the trade committees heretofore established by the War Trade Board. It may therefore be expected that the natural desires of the various trades to con-solidate the position they have achieved, during the past four years and their ambitions for post-war expansion may play a part hardly less important than im-mediate war needs in the programmes of allocation of raw materials which the Board will propose or support. Indications of this tendency have been notably evident in the recent negotiations regarding tin and tungsten.In the case of tin, it is quite apparent that the policy of the Board is being unobtrusively but effectively dictated by the representative of the United States Steel Corporation, who acts on the Advisory Committee. In the case of tungsten, the expert adviser, who belongs to a firm engaged in dealing in that commodity, displayed considerable anxiety to pool prices, with the object of gaining an abnormal advantage for the United States.These trade experts have likewise succeeded to some extent in impressing on the chiefs of the bureaux the view that British policy as regards allocation and price tends to give an undue advantage to British trade and industry, and that while we are encouraging the United States to a greater sacrifice of industrial and com-mercial interests for the more vigorous prosecution of the war, we are at the same time taking steps not. only to consolidate our own trade, but even to secure its expansion hereafter, in competition with American industries. In other words, they profess to suspect that Great Britain is taking advantage of America&apos;s pro-gressive immersion in the war to lay the foundation of what the New York &quot; Evening Post &quot; has described as &quot; a vigorous commercial offensive on a world-wide scale.&quot;&apos; .In confirmation of these suspicions they point to the public announcement of the activities of the Department for the Development of Overseas Trade.On the other hand, it is undoubtedly true that post helium trade considerations are not overlooked on this side. The Chairman of the Shipping Board, for example, in a recent address to the National Security League in Chicago, made no conceal-ment of the hopes entertained of future trade expansion through the agency of the immense amount of merchant tonnage which will be added to the American Registry by the Emergency Fleet Corporation. &quot;The American manufacturers,&quot; he said, &quot;bankers and. business men generally may well begin to-day to think in terms of world markets. When peace comes we shall find ourselves with an enormous mercantile marine on hand, as well as a ship manufacturing industry of magnitude unlike anything that has hitherto existed. Success in employing that merchant marine hangs squarely upon manufacturing efficiency.&quot;The activities of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce are also being directed to the possibilities of the development of American trade in South America and the Far East.It is, however, unnecessary to point out that allusion to the attention being given in this country to these questions of prospective trade developments affords no satisfactory rejoinder to insinuations and inferences based on comments such as those of the New York &quot;Evening Post.&quot; Rejoinders and explanations would at this time only tend to further mutual misunderstandings. It would be better in the present situation that less publicity should be given to the operation of these new Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which have no direct association with the actual conduct of the war.In this connection it may be well; to correct.an erroneous impression which appears to prevail in certain quarters at home as to the exact functions of the Federal Trade Commission. The Act creating it was approved in September 1914, in response to a suggestion of the President of the United States that, in connection with the provisions of the anti-trust laws, &quot;there ought to be an Administrative Commission capable of directing and shaping such corrective processes (against illegal combinations and monopolies) not only in aid of the Courts, but by indepen-dent suggestion if necessary.Its establishment put an end to the anomalous situation created by the practice of the Courts of not merely deciding whether a given combination was illegal, but pre-scribing the means by which it might be reorganised in harmony with legal require-ments and supervising the steps taken to that end. The Courts were thus exercising ministerial as well as judicial functions, and it was feared by many that this practice if allowed to continue, would grow into a system of Court constructions akin to the English Common Law, and that an unwritten Constitution might be superimposed on the written Constitution of the United States.[367-31]
The Commission, therefore, took over the administrative and corrective functions previously assumed by the Courts. It received power to compel corpora-tionsto file periodical or special reports as to their organisation, relations, and practices, to investigate and report concerning alleged violations of the Anti-trust Acts, to discover and take steps to prevent &apos;1 unfair methods of competition.&apos;&apos; It is, moreover, authorised to examine, by such means as it may possess, trade conditions in foreign countries with respect to combinations or other conditions affecting the foreign trade of the United States. In the exercise of this latter function- the Commission compiled its report on &quot; Co-operation in Foreign Trade,&quot; which recom-mended permissive legislation authorising American firms to combine for export business. This report resulted in the enactment of the Export Trade (Webb-Pomerene Law), and probably occasioned the mistaken action, above referred to, of the character and scope of the&apos; Commission^ activities. It is true that the Corn-mission has interpreted its functions broadly and has aimed at giving incidental help to American business, but it cannot properly be regarded as a trade-promoting agency in any sense.The Chairman of -the Commission is an ex officio member of the main Advisory Committee of the War Industries Board. Of late its services have been enlisted by the Food Administration and other war organisations in disclosing attempts at &quot;profiteering.&quot; In this connection it has just published a report charging that unfair and extortionate profits were being made by many of the great industries upon which the country&apos;s war programme depends, and recommending the imposition of heavy excess profits taxes as a check on such practices.As regards the) relations between the War Trade Board and the Shipping Board, there has recently been a marked tendency towards closer co-ordination. This is especially important in connection with the application of import and export restrictions.Import restrictions are imposed by resolution of the War Trade Board, though proposals for such action originate in a Committee under the Shipping Board, who after reviewing all the relative evidence obtainable, make their recommendations as to the degree of prohibition desirable. The recommendations are examined by the State Department, the Treasury, and any other Departments of the Government specially interested, before action is taken by the War Trade Board. The importa-tion of every article of commerce is, as you are aware, subject to an import licence, issued by the Bureau of Imports, and licences are freely granted except in the case of materials or merchandise where a definite limit has been set to the quantity which may come forward in a given period. Such limitations (fixed already in respect of a considerable number of articles of a bulky character) have for their object the conservation of tonnage and the gradual elimination of non-essentials. It is rather too early as yet to determine the extent to which they have achieved these ends, but the regulations are being vigorously applied by the officials concerned.As regards exports restrictions, it may bej observed that the War Trade Board are conscious of having gained a certain amount of international experience, par-ticularly in their negotiations with the Northern neutrals, and are consequently inclined to examine much more critically than before any proposals put forward by the Allied Embassies. They obviously feel that the increased share of war burdens which has now fallen to the lot of the United States should make the views of this Government more weighty in the Allied Councils. The old suspicion of the influence exerted on their representatives abroad by Allied Governments- has not entirely disappeared, and they are still somewhat inclined to disregard communications to the effect that their representatives at Allied capitals are satisfied as to the advisa-bility of measures proposed in London or Paris. This feeling has been particularly noticeable on one or two recent occasions, when Mr. Sheldon professed himself satisfied with decisions in London which, on examination here, were found to leave much to be desired from the point of view of the United States.The business world generally has accepted loyally, and with a minimum of complaint, the various restrictions and regulations necessitated by the policies of the Board. Few cases have come to the notice of the Embassy of yielding to pressure brought to bear by Members of Congress, at the instance of their constituents. As was only to be expected in the case of an organisation created d&amp; novo, many administrative errors were committed at first, but matters in this respect have improved considerably in the cour-se of the past two months.During the month of June, for the first time, the procedure under which, the War Trade Board telegraphs to the Allied Blockade Council for approval par-ticulars of all applications for export licences on shipments to the border neutrals
was thoroughly tested. Owing to the conclusion of the Norwegian Agreement, and the raising of the general embargo as-regards &quot;non-essentials&quot; to Sweden, Den-mark, and Holland, a very considerable number of applications were received and dealt with.The method of telegraphing applications to London and dealing with the replies when received is almost identical with the system previously evolved by the Trade Department of the Embassy for dealing with applications for letters of assurance.   It has been found to work smoothly and well.The officials concerned have so far listened to any suggestions and criticisms, and it is difficult to see how the co-operation between them and the representatives of the Trade Department of this Embassy could be closer. From time to time difficulties have arisen regarding specific applications, generally through the indi-vidual action of some member of the Board, who either through ignorance of the rules or a desire to propitiate an importunate exporter, has promised facilities which could not properly be granted without reference to London. In such cases the officials have proved themselves fully alive to the importance of abiding by the procedure laid down, and as a rule have been able to arrange matters satisfactorily.Some difficulty has also been experienced in the case of shipments of foodstuffs which have primarily to be approved by the representative of the Food Aclministra-tion. There has, however, been a distinct improvement in this respect, which will no doubt continue as the special regulations and rules governing the issue of licences-to the border neutrals become better known amongst the various divisions.The administration of the United States Trading with the Enemy Act is entrusted, as regards external trade,&apos; to the War Trade Board, who have organised a Bureau of War Trade Intelligence and a Bureau of Enemy Trade for that purpose. These bureaux have now reached the stage of comparatively good organisation, and work in the closest and most cordial co-operation with the Embassy. Weekly joint inter-Allied conferences have for some time past been held for the consideration of Allied published black lists in South America. A policy of joint consultation regarding confidential black lists, cloak lists, and the issue of enemy trading licences has recently been inaugurated. All questions affecting new regulations or the adoption of new policies are informally discussed with the Embassy before any decision is reached. The bureau is somewhat handicapped in carrying out, as far as it would like, an active campaign against German firms by: (a.) The limitations of the Enemy Trading Law. (This, however, it is hoped to remedy by the passage by Congress of an amending Act, probably not, however, till the autumn.)(&amp;.) By the reluctance of the State Department to bring pressure to bear on South American Republics, where such pressure could in any way be construed as pressure to commit acts which could be classed as illegal. The State Department in this regard are peculiarly susceptible to repre-sentations made by representatives of the South American Republics in Washington, and often yield on points regarded by the War Trade Intelligence as important.A further difficulty lies in the fact that the State Department have hitherto been reluctant to issue instructions to United States consular officers regarding the measures they should take to enforce the observance of the i Enemy Trading Act in their respective jurisdictions, e.g., by bunker control, taking of guarantees, con-signment to consuls, and supervision of distribution. This is now being actively taken up by the Chairman of the War Trade Board, and it is hoped that compre-hensive instructions analogous to British practice will shortly be issued.. The only possibly source of friction lies now in interference by British consular officers in trade with the United States. The War Trade&apos; Intelligence feel, somewhat naturally, that they are now sufficiently well organised to be able to deal themselves with offenders among United States merchants. The recently-inaugurated system of consular certificates of origin should materially help in this direction.Complaints have been received from some of His Majesty&apos;s representatives of lack of co-operation on the part of their United States colleagues. The War Trade Intelligence, whose attention has been called to these cases, hopes in time to have representatives of their own attached to the United States missions in South America, and thus to get over a difficulty largely caused by the inadequate staffs of the United States missions concerned.Those provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Laws which affect enemy property and interests in the United States are assigned to the Alien Property
Custodian, an independent official, whose functions and powers have been described in various despatches to the Foreign Office and unofficial&apos;letters to the Foreign * Trade Department,Briefly stated, his duty is to take over and administer all enemy property in the United States and to account for it to Congress at the termination of the war. Mr. A. Mitchell Palmer, who was appointed to the office shortly after its establish-ment by the Trading with the Enemy Act of the 6th October, 1917, was formerly a Democratic Member of Congress for the State of Pennsylvania, He first came into prominence in connection with the passage of the Underwood Tariff Act of 1913, and he appears to have been a strong supporter of the policies of the Wilson Administration, His knowledge of Congressional procedure has enabled him to have the powers of his office usefully extended since the enactment of the original law creating it, By the simple expedient of ajn amendment to an &quot; Urgent Deficiencies Appropriation Bill,&quot; he succeeded in eliminating practically all the limitations which the original Act imposed on his authority to sell enemy-owned property in the United States, and by a recent Presidential Proclamation his juris-diction has been extended to include the property of enemy nationals interned in this country or included in the Enemy Trading List, issued by the War Trade Board.Mr. Mitchell Palmers extended powers have, thus far, been vigorously exercised, and there is every indication that he is determined to weed out all impor-tant enemy interest and influence from American industrial and commercial enterprises. The total value of the enemy property which had passed under his control by the 15th May last that is to say, within six or seven months after his appointment-is roughly estimated at $347,000,000. In addition to this, he has assumed control over a large number of powerful industrial firms and combinations which were formerly controlled by German capital or in German interest. Notable amongst these may be mentioned the German-owned woollen mills in Passaic, New Jersey, which include the Botany Worsted Mills, the Passaic Worsted Spinning Mills, the Gera Mills, the New Jersey Worsted Spinning Company, and the Forstmann and Huffmann Company. These mills are stated to represent an aggregate value of 170,000,000. The plants will henceforth be worked in the Government service and the profits invested in Liberty Bonds. To defeat the subterfuges adopted by the interested German capitalists for the diirpose of escaping the effects of American Trading with the Enemy legislation, nominal transfers of property, transfers for the duration of the war, sales against long-time obligations, and the like, Mr. Palmer states that he has enlisted the services of more than one hundred and forty thousand lawyers all over the United States. The Chief of his Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Francis P. Garvan, was formerly assistant District Attorney in New York, who has had a wide experience in the prosecution of criminal cases, and the employment of Mr. Joseph H. Choate, Jan., to take charge of the examination of the large German American Chemical Companies may be taken as an earnest of a vigorous and patriotic policy.In common with most other American officials holding temporary appointments during the regime of one or other of the political parties, Mr. Mitchell Palmer likes to bring his office and his achievements to the notice of the public. On the 20th May he made an important speech at Detroit, copies of which were forwarded to the Foreign Office, while more recently he contributed an article to one of the current periodicals, from which the following interesting paragraphs may be quoted as showing the principles upon which his future action is likely to be based: &quot; Sales of enemy interest in industrial and commercial concerns will be made only to American citizens who satisfy the Alien Property Custodian that they represent American capital exclusively, and that they do not propose to purchase for the benefit, either present or prospective, of the enemy.&quot;&quot; The Custodian realises that in making these sales he will be obliged to consider not only the character of the purchasers, in order to establish a true Americanisation of the properties, but also the effect upon American markets, both industrial and financial, that might be produced by the rapid liquidation of large enemy holdings. He will of course require a fair and adequate price, in order that, at the end of the war, the United States may be in a position to account in such manner as Congress shall direot for the actual value of the properties taken over and sold or otherwise liquidated.&quot;o
