llpmorandum by the Chief of tho Imperial General Staff. (toculatq,d.7.1th reference to War Cabinet 455, ainuto 5 ).With reference to Hinuios of War Cabinet Meeting Ho.455, of the 7th August, a conference was held at the War Office on the 13th August at which representatives of the Ministries of jVood and shipping were present.The ministry of Shipping can allocate shipping at once for this purpose, but only at the expense of other&quot;urgent requirements, probably from tonnage allotted to the transport of american troops.The Ministry of Irood can supply in Canada about 15,000 tons of flour which can be shipped at once, thus saving inevitable delay which would ensue if the Americans wore asked to redeem their promise and load supplies in our shipping themselves, The Ministry are- not in a&apos;position to send any other kinds of food-stuffs, but as flour is the staple, and the 15,000 tone would mean an allowance of 2 lb per day for 100,000 people for nearly 6 months, this would be a considerable measure of relief.The Americans mast be asked however to replace this flour as early as possible, as it is new held for the &apos;.7ar Office for the requirements of forces in France and in England.Tho latest date on which ships conveying food must leave America for Archangel is September 6th.Tho decision of tho War Cabinet is required as to the allocation of the 3 ships which it is understood would be required for the above purpose, and.for the utilisation of the flour reserve of 15,000 tons..(Signed), R*STEL1.Col. for CoI.G.3.icral Staff, War Office...12th August, 1918.
