Week ended 3rd August, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Minelaying operations have been continued in the North Sea, in the Heligoland Bight North Sea. and in the northern approaches to&apos;the Dover Straits.On 31st July one of our large America seaplanes while on patrol from Yarmouth, in company-With an aeroplane, was engaged by enemy aircraft and shot down in flames, two men being drowned.Airship C25 which went out to search for an enemy submarine in the North Sea on 1st August has not returned, and the search for the airship has been carried out without result.On 2nd August a patrol of large America seaplanes sighted and chased a Zeppelin to the N.W. of Terschelling Bank, but were unable to overtake it. One large America was compelled to alight on the sea owing to defects, and the crew were picked up and taken to Holland by a Dutch drifter after they had destroyed the machine. -In addition to reconnaissances which have been carried out in various areas by Zanders R.A.F. machines employed on naval duty, the following raids have been made by our Area,machines from Dunkirk:  * -        . :-           .      -       .               &apos;   Approximate -   ,        &apos;                    \i     &apos;&quot;-weight of &apos;i     .,.        .; Date. ,                .

Meditcr-raneanCasualtiesOn 26th and 28th July our machines carried out bombing attacks on Nagara and Galata, and on 27th July bombs were dropped on the basin and dockyard at Constanti-nople.  One of our machines is missing.On 28th July the aerodrome at Imbros was attacked by enemy aircraft, one Bessoneau containing seven machines being totally destroyed.On 2nd August four of our machines from Taranto carried out an attack on Cattaro, and bombs were dropped on three submarines and on the seaplane base. One of our machines was seen to land on the shore of! Malaluka Bay, 2) miles S.E. of Cattaro, and is assumed to have been damaged by gunfire.On 30th July the Special Service Vessel &quot; Stockforce &quot; was torpedoed and sunk in action with an enemy submarine 26 miles to the S.W. of Start Point, one officer and five men being injured.   The submarine also was sunk by gunfire from &quot; Stockforce.&quot;On 2nd August the destroyers &quot; Vehement &quot; and &quot; Ariel,&quot; whilst operating in the North Sea, struck enemy moored mines and were sunk, four officers and 45 men being lost from &quot; Ariel.&quot; and one officer and 47 men from &quot; Vehement.&quot;On 3rd August the ambulance transport &quot; Warilda,&quot; on passage from Havre to Southampton, was torpedoed and sunk by an enemy submarine 35 miles from Beachy Head. Two military officers, 113 other ranks, one Commandant Q.M.A.A.C., and one officer and six men of the crew were lost.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.0Derat,nneS During the week under review about 25 enemy submarines of a type which, operates further afield than the North Sea were located. Amongst these were four of the &quot;cruiser&quot; type, all of which were either operating off, or on passage to, the American or Canadian Coasts. One of the four was probably a new type of minelaying submarine. Of the other large boats four or five were operating off the north coast of Ireland, seven or eight between the south of Ireland and the north coast of Spain and one off the coast of Portugal, the remainder being on passage. At the present time the majority of homeward bound enemy submarines appear to be passing through Norwegian Territorial Waters.The week has been marked by some increase of activity in the English Channel, but considerably fewer submarine attacks were reported from the North Sea.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemywith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during. recent weeks submarines. and the nature of the craft which have been engaged ; and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed or lost to the enemy as the result of such actions: 	Week	ended	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		July 13th.

ENEMY MINES.Minelaying.Casualties.During the week under review enemy minelaying activity in Home Waters has been experienced in the Lowestoft, Harwich and Dover areas, mines having been laid in the two first-mentioned areas after an interval of a month. A group laid in the Downs was cleverly placed well inside and across the traffic route, resulting in the loss of H.M. Drifter &quot; City of Liverpool&quot; and necessitating the holding up of traffic for a short period.The following Table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels sunk by mine in Home Waters (including the Havre and Cherbourg areas) in recent weeks: Week JEnded.

FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.On August 1st the Allied Expeditionary Force occupied Modyugski Island after slight opposition, and on proceeding to Archangel landed without difficulty on August 2nd. The collapse of the Bolsheviks proved complete, all troops excepting those friendly to the Allies withdrawing to the left bank of the river where fighting was proceeding on August 3rd. The arrival of the Allies was greeted with general enthusiasm by the inhabitants, and the Allied Consuls who had been arrested by the Bolsheviks on August 1st were released the following day by the new administration which is known as the &quot; Supreme Directorate of the Northern Region.&quot;The Russian cruiser &quot;Askold&quot; has been commissioned at Murmansk for service under the British flag. A Russian trawler, which had acted as escort to the*ship convey-ing diplomatic representatives of Foreign Powers from Archangel to Kandalaksha, on proceeding to sea on the evening of July 31st, opened fire on Allied troops, and steps are being taken to deal with her.Enemy aeroplanes are reported at Kay ana.It is reported that a coup d&apos;etat occurred at Baku on July 25th, when the Bolsheviks were overthrown and a new Government, which has requested British support, was formed.The Japanese are sending a naval force to the mouth of the Amur river to prevent the escape of Bolshevik gunboats, and to protect Allied subjects at Nikolaevsk.The immediate reinforcement of the Czech troops in the Vladivostok area is urgently required, as the Czech flank-guard on the Ussuri railway leading to Harbarovsk is weak, and at an Allied Conference held at Vladivostok on July 31st it was unanimously decided to ask that two divisions of Allied troops should at once be sent in support of the Czechs.France.The French cruiser &quot; Amiral Aube &quot; participated in the recent operations resulting in the occupation of Archangel.A Government Bill is about to be introduced to substantially increase the pay of all Naval Ratings by approximately 50 per cent.Spain.There are indications that the Spanish Government may shortly take drastic steps in its dealings with Germany in regard to the systematic destruction of the Spanish Mercantile Fleet. The reverses recently sustained by the German Forces on the Western Front may precipitate matters, and, moreover, there have recently been several very flagrant cases in which Spanish vessels have been attacked and sunk by German submarines, with the inevitable loss of Spanish lives. In this connection it is reported that the German Government has now agreed to pay an indemnity for the loss of the Spanish steamer &quot; Sardiniero,&quot; sunk by submarine on February 23rd, 1918.Naval Staff.8th August, 1918.
