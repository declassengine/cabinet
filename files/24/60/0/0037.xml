Political Intelligence Dei^artment,Foreign Office.[August 1, 1918.]Norway/004. Sweden/008. DenmarkA) 05.MEMORANDUMONSCANDINAVIAN CO-OPERATION.1 0VARIOUS plans for concerted action with a view to closer relations between Norway, Sweden, and Denmark have taken definite shape during the last few months, and it would appear that there is at -the present time a general desire in all these countries for intimate co-operation in various fields. Royal, inter-Parliamentary, and inter-Ministerial conferences have followed rapidly one on the other, and the Scandinavian press is full of articles dealing with the situation and its possibilities.With regard to the question of economic exchange, organisations were set up as far back as March 1917 to arrange for exchange of goods between the Scandinavian countries, and since that date meetings have taken place at Christiania, Stockholm, and Copenhagen (March 1918). A communique issued by the Swedish Government on the 5th April of this year, and a statement by Mr. Fryxell, General Director of the Swedish Kommerskollegium (Board of Trade) at the end of April give an idea of the extent to which this exchange of goods had then already taken place. The former pointed out that without daily supplies of bread-corn Sweden would have been forced to reduce her bread ration, and the latter stated that Scandinavian co-operation with a view to counteracting difficulties in importation had taken proportions exceeding those expected. * His remarks were apparently founded on the following figures, which appeared in the Malmo paper &quot; Arbeitet.&quot; Danish exports to Sweden in January-February 1918 to the value of 24 million kronor as compared to 850,000 kronor in the same months of 1917.On the 3rd June a meeting was held at Lund of the chiefs of the three Scandinavian statistical bureaux, and it was decided to bring out a report on Scandinavian trade in the years 1912-1917, and to publish more detailed statistics relative to the exchange between the three countries. Part, if not primary, object of this action is plainly to facilitate the further exchange of goods.The latest development, and one which, if successful, is destined to knit very closely the economic ties between Norway. Denmark, and Sweden, and to render them eventually in some respects an economic unit vis-d-vis the outside world, is the scheme now being considered to combine the consumers&apos; operative organisations in the three countries, and to set up a central agency (&quot; Nordisk Andels Forbund &quot;) in Copenhagen. The capital of the agency is to be 40 million kronor, and it is estimated that the capital of the three Scandinavian organisations in combination represent 200 million kronor. This agency is to buy direct from the producers goods, such as coffee and rice, previously purchased through firms in London, Hamburg, and other towns, and it is proposed that its activities shall eventually be extended to shipping, manufactures, and even the purchase of such sources of production as coffee plantations and the like.The new policy is by no means to be confined to the economic sphere. The three Scandinavian Governments have, for instance, ratified an agreement whereby the cost of press telegrams between the three Scandinavian countries will be considerably reduced. This scheme will shortly be put into practice. Then, relative to developments of the air service, information has been received that, although in general aviators will not be allowed to fly over the territory of any of the Scandinavian countries, certain reciprocal treatment of Scandinavian aviators will be arranged, by which they will be allowed to. fly over Scandinavian territories. Details of a proposed inter-Scandinavian air service are now under consideration.The universities, too, are doing their part, and a congress of the Association of Northern Students, held in Christiania on the 26th June, expression was given to the wish for closer inter-Scandinavian academic association and intercourse. Resolutions were passed recommending the founding of Northern clubs in the university and high school towns in Scandinavia, and the consideration of the question of reviving the[367-32]
Northern academic meetings, which had been allowed to lapse after the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union in 1.905.In addition, meetings of the following bodies have been held : Committee of Scandinavian (Jo-operation for Workmens Insurance against Accidents, Scandinavian Union of Agricultural Investigators, Union of Scandinavian Shipowners, Permanent Joint Committee of Scandinavian Employers.A communique issued to the press (the 28th June), after the Scandinavian inter-Ministerial Conference held at Copenhagen on the 2Gth June and following days, denotes an extension of the domain of common action. In this communique it was stated that the question of instituting co-operation in the social-political sphere had been discussed, and that it had been decided to examine the possibilities of this clepar-ture; also that the regulations regarding the admission of foreigners to the three countries, and the principles on which their taxation should be based, bad been deliberated on with a view to reaching a uniform decision on this point.    ,With regard to the first of these questions, the attitude of M. Castberg, President of the Norwegian Odelsting, is worth noting. He was approached by &quot; Tidens Tegn &quot; as the man who had taken the initiative with regard to co-operation in the social-political sphere, and the interview shows that he is opposed to uniform legislation in this regard. &quot; I have already,&quot; he stated, &quot; on former occasions taken up the stand-point that legislation in any one of the Northern countries shall not be restricted by Scandinavian co-operation. These questions have become of a purely political kind, and consequently the Government in a more conservative country must not be allowed to hinder developments in a country which has progressed further.&quot; This is a point of view which, at any rate in Norway, is likely to find strong support. M. Mowinckel, a prominent leader of the Norwegian &quot; Left,&quot; and Castberg&apos;s great political opponent, has thrown himself heart and soul into the new movement. He maintains that the North must stand or fall together. &quot;If only the three countries come united out of war into peace, then they have learnt a lesson which will carry weight, also, it is to be hoped, outside our countries&apos; frontiers.&quot;In general it must be said that the movement has had a very favourable reception both in the press and among statesmen of all three countries. The Danish &quot; National-tidende&quot; has published a series of interviews with leading Scandinavians who all express themselves in favour of co-operation, and the fact emerges that in their opinion, it is principally because of the economic war which is likely to follow on the world-war, that it is so essential for the three countries to work together. As regards the press there is unusual unanimity, and it is noteworthy that in none of the three countries is the question handled on party lines. In the Swedish press especially satisfaction is expressed that it is intended to continue the commercial co-operation of the three countries after the war.It would appear highly probable that the policy for exchangegpf goods, already so successfully initiated, is likely to. be continued and satisfactorily developed in the future. The products of Swedish mines and Swedish industries, the water-power, mines, and the shipping of Norway, and the agricultural produce of Denmark- provide excellent material for interchange. Whether, however, out of these and other move-ments and schemes a Scandinavian League is likely to develop only the future can show. So much can be said, however, that however much material considerations may work to bring about closer economic relations it is not inherently likely that Scandi-navian co-operation will extend to the domain of foreign policy for the following reasons : The respective geographical situations of Norway and Denmark draw the two countries in different directions. Norway, wholly pro-Entente in feeling, looks to the West only, and is to all intents and purposes free to choose her own path. Denmark, although her inhabitants are on the whole strongly pro-Entente, is, owing to her geographical position, strongly under the influence of Germany. She literally cannot afford to incline west-wards to any marked extent, and must remain within the German orbit unless the world-war breaks Germany&apos;s strength, or, better still, her aggressive spirit. Between these two lies Sweden. Certainly there is no bond of union as long as the conservative classes, with their caste spirit and almost Prussian mentality, retain a position of power and influence.There is, in addition, little sympathy between the three peoples. The Swedes affect to despise the rugged and simple Norwegians and dislike the Danes, who in business dealings usually succeed in getting the upper hand it is sometimes suggested by foul as well as by fair means and whose slimness is consequently almost proverbial in.Sweden. The &quot;Norwegians dislike the average Swede, whom they regard as untrust-worthy, with an almost insufferable affectation of cultural superiority; in addition?
having succeded in breaking the Union with Sweden in 1905, they are inclined to regard any plans for political association with her with the utmost suspicion. The Danes, for their part, never pretend to have much in common with the Swedes in general, and severely criticise the arrogance of the upper-class Swede member of the military and bureaucratic castes.There can be no doubt that it is the stress of circumstances due to belligerent pressure which has led to the strong development of the Scandinavian co-operative movement. When the war is over it is more than likely that the old jealousies and antipathies will come to the fore and seriously handicap, if not frustrate, the efforts of those Scandinavians who believe that the closest co-operation in every field is essential to the future welfare of the Northern countries.
