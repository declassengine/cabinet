SECRET, G.T. 5.348.OS$00)0^TO, O/IBIKET.(Iv-lXli.OLI TglCpRATIOI:^. Memorandum by Mr, A, Chamberlain. (See also C.T. 1344, G.T, 1839, and G.T. 2676).I learn from a letter in the public Press that it has been decided to issue a medal to Australian, Now Zealand and newfound-land troops who served in Gallipoli.I am not clear whether it is proposed to confine the issue to these troops alone or whether some others are included.     In any case it would appear that the decoration is not to be given to troops from the United Kingdom or from India, nor apparently - is any similar decoration proposed for the Royal Kavy.I submit to the Cabinet that this decision cannot stand. Others will speak for the Royal Navy and the United Kingdom forces.. But I desire at once to draw attention to the case cf the Indian troops.     To exclude from recognition the Ghurlcas who reached the orest of the heights at Anzac and looked down from them, upon the Dardanelles, or the 14th Sikhs- who at Cape Helles %&amp;:r; fa one day   21 cut of 26 Officers and 430 out cf 550 ether ranks would be an act of injustice and ingratitude that would be deeply felt by the Indian Army and all associated with it.     I submit that since a decoration is to be given to some of the troops who fought, in Gallipoli it must be given to all.But I go further.     This subject was very fully discussed at the Imperial War Conference last year.     The Army Council then proposed the issue of two medals,(l)    an international medal to be given to all Officers and soldiers who entered a theatre of operations,(2)   A purely British medal for all Officers and soldiersof H.M.Forces who did not ontor a theatre of operationsIt was proposed that clasps should bo issued, but that those clasps should not record either actions or localities, but only $ calender years of the duration of the war1, one clasp being given for each year cr part of a year.These proposals were not well received, by the Conference and no definite decision was reached;   but on one point I think that all or nearly all the members of the Conference were agreed as well as the Army Council and Sir E, Pcnsonby, namely, that if special med   s or olasps were given for any one theatre of war, the same would have to be done for other main theatres cf operations.Sinoe a special decoration is now authorized for Gallipoli I urge that similar recognition must also be given to the forces who served in Mesopotamia, and particularly to those who endured, tin extraordinary hardships of the early operations in that theatre o.c-took part in General Maude1s brilliant campaign which ended in tne capture of Bagdad.
mw 2 **The truth is that for reasons which were doubtless con-clusive the Army Ckmnoil have been obliged to abandon their -earlier standpoint but they appear to have done so without any reconsi&amp;emtion of the problem as a whole,     I feel confident that the illogical position into which they have been forced oannot be maintained and that the sooner an announcement is made that the whole subject will be reconsidered in the light of this decision the better it will be for all concerned.     If we do not act quickly and of our own motion, we shall be forced into action by public agitation.(initialled)       A. C.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.7.18th August, 1918.
