So c; rotary, Air ,.ivli,nistry, to secretary, Tver QTibTiicT^(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 452, Minute 5).AIR MINISTRY,Strand, W.C.2,, 2788/O.A.S. 5th August, 1918.With reference to Minute 5, *.iar Cabinet Meeting 452 of the 24th July, 1918, dealing with the subject of casualties to the pilots and observers of tho Royal Air Force, I am command-cd by the Air Council to inform you that this question has been considered by the Air Staff and statistics have been prepared showing the mortality rate of Royal Air Force personnel.Owing to tho fact that statistics previous to March, 1918, comprise casualties to the Royal Flying Corps only, the table herewith submitted has been drawn up to shew casualties occurring to the Expeditionary Force on tho Western Front only, and no account has been taken of the smaller number of casualties suffered by the various smaller Expeditionary Forces, and air-craft operating with the Navy.From a study of this table it will be evident that the general statement made by the Chief of the Air Staff at the Meeting, to the effect that no material increase had taken place in the rate of casualties, are fully borne out by the statistics.iffThe table showsfl) The number of killed and missing month by month.(E) The number of hours flown,&apos;(3) The casualty rate, i,e., the number of hours flown per pilot or observer killed or missing.The casualties include only killed and missing in order that comparison may readily bo made with the fatal accidents occurring in training.   Had the casualties included wounded the rates would have been substantially proportionate.For the last 6 months of 1916 the average number of hours flown per casualty was 206, whereas for the second six months of 1917 they were 172, showing that the casualty rate had increased.     From   January 1918 on, however, the rate has continued to improve and the average for the 6 months ending June, 1918, was 222,
This figure would, no doubt,, have been much higher had it not been for the exceptional activity in Uarch and April.    Excluding these months the average was 251*I amSir,Your obedient Servant(Signed). W.A.ROBINSON-The Secretary, War Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1*
