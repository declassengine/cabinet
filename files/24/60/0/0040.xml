jgjS DOCUMENT fS THE PROPERTY      HIS BRITANNIC fcAJflSTY^ gggBSS^Jj C R E r,WAR   CABINETBOTUITING   IN MRglyAMP,?opy of letter from the Chief Secretary for &apos;r eland, to Secretary, Y/arQaMnetY: - - -------Irish office,7th August, 1918,My dear Han&amp;ey, ...For the purposes of recruiting Ireland has &quot;been divided into 10 districts,   I refer of course to the purposes of the recruiting done by the Irish Recruiting Council, and not the War Office.    The Ministry of National Service have allocated to each district their fair quota of the 50,000 recruits asked for by the 1st of October and of the subsequent monthly numbers.      Some time ago a Conference was held at the Ministry of National Service at which were present representatives of the Irish Recruiting Council, the Ministry of National Service/ the War Office, the Admiralty, and the Air Service..    The Conference were agreed that it v/ould be fair that any district which provided its quota as laid down by the Ministry of National Service should be considered to have fulfilled the conditions set out in&apos;JiOrd Frenches proclamation.   Of course before any publio announcement to that effect could be made, I, should be obliged to have Cabinet sanction.   Could you put the question on the Agenda either for tomorrow or Friday.   I should be greatly obliged if you could as I want to return to Ireland on Friday night and the matter is urgent.Yours sincerely,(Sd,)   Edward Shorttt.Lt.-Col. Sir Maurice Hankey, K.CB.\
