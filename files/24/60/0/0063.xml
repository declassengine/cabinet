Joint Committee,

9, Victoria Street,

London S.W. 1.

1st August, 1918.

The Rt. Hon.

David Lloyd George, M.P.

Prime Minister,

10, Downing Street, S.W. 1.

Sir,

We are directed by the National Joint Committee of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and Shipyard Trade Unions to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a Resolution passed unanimously by the District Tonnage Output Joint Committee for the Tyne respecting the withdrawal of men from shipyards for the Army.

The National Joint Committee desire us: to say that they fully endorse the opinion expressed in the Resolution and wish to emphasise the fact that if the withdrawal of skilled men of fit physical condition continues, it will be impossible to maintain the present output of wore in ship-building and shiprepairing which is considered to be considerably less than the needs of the Nation demand and quite impossible to increase that output.

In these circumstances the National Joint Committee suggest for you to consider, that the question should be re-considered with a view to steps being taken to prevent any further recruitment of men from shipbuilding and shiprepairing.

We are, Sir,

Your obedient Servants,

(sd) FRANK SMITH,

(sd) A.R. DUNCAN

Joint Secretaries.

RESOLUTION -
pSQLUTIQH.OF Tilt DISTINCT-lUmOhi OUTPUT JOINT COMMIT TifiE FOR TEa, TYKE.The Members of trie District Tonnage Output Joint       &apos;: -Committee for the Tyne, at this their first meeting, view with grave concern, the serious effect which the further calls, for men from shipyards, and Shiprepairing establishments, for service vith tne&apos;Forces, have had and will have upon the- out-put of warship .and.:merchant ship construction - and&apos; repairs . It is understood that tonnage..Output Committees have been set up in the. shipbuilding and-, ship repairing districts to . co-operate with the Admiralty, in securing increased production of tonnage,-and it .is pointed out that further &quot;withdrawal? of skilled men from the industry must - defeat this object.It is urged also that all the links in the chain of trades which produce ships complete and repair them must be kept up to their proper strength.    The application of the &quot;clean cut&quot; to young men in the essential crafts of ships fitters&apos; and engineers, joiners, plumbers and draughtsmen, who are hot protected under age 25, weakens these links, disturbs the balance and adversely affects the output of the other essential trades that are protected at age 19.   This must retard production very seriously.this meeting therefore requests the National TonnageOutput JointCommittee to make-strong repre-s en tat ions to thePrime Minister, the yirst Lord bf the Admiralty-&apos;&apos; and the    :Controller General of,Merchant $hftibuildin-.&quot;,&apos; with aLview to preventing furcner calling up or men fron the industry, and-that an emergency meeting of the. National Committee he convened for this purpose. at; once, if necessary.
