QQatiomOeryT^ re attacheoTsclieme for dealing witF&quot;! an Power in Wool Textile. TracVe/124/Cloth/l7631st August, 1918,Sir,I am directed to refer to your conference today with the Board of Control of the Wool Textile Industries concerning the scheme drawn up by the Ministry of National Service after consultation with the War Office on the question of Man Power In the Woolten and Worsted Trades.It was understood by the Board that the conditions necessary to the adoption of the scheme were(a) that the Board was sufficiently representative of the Trade, in ell its branches, Including both employers and employed,(b) that the Board was willing and able to assume responsibility on behalf of the Ttf&amp;de for the operation of the scheme,I am directed by the Board to give an assurance to your   -Department on these two points, and to forward the following resolution passed at the meeting&quot;That the Board approves the scheme submitted by the Chairman, and pledges itself to carry It loyally into effect&quot;.The resolution wa3 proposed and seconded by representatives of the employers and workpeople respectively.Before the fiesolution was passed the Chairman impressed upon the members of the Board, and especially the Labour members, the grave responsibilities which they were undertaking.   The unanimous feeling was, however, strongly expressed that the present machinery was wholly inadequate to reconcile the conflicting claims for men and for production for Army supplies, and that a point had been reached where it was absolutely necessary that a change of a drastic nature should be made.   It was pointed out that in practice the system of Advisory Committees had broken down, and it was strongly felt that the principle of self-government contained in the scheme embodied the most practicable method possible of restoring confidence throughout the   * trade, ensuring necessary supplies to the Armies, and of effecting a more scientific adjustment with regard to man power.I am further to enclose a copy of the scheme referred to, including a revised list of trades which the Board suggests should be brought under the scope of the scheme, and to point out that in , this list there have been included four subsidiary trades upofc which the wool textile industry is dependent but which are not part of that industry.   The inclusion of these four trades is not regarded as vital to the scheme, but having regard to their size and importance it Is suggested that they should be included.The Board
261&apos;rj?h.o Board Sully appreciated the administrative dif/loultios which would arise, and expressed the opinion that if the scheme as proposed was to bo a bucooss, time for preparation must be given, a careful individual census of tho trade taken, and the whole of the information thus obtained co-ordinated with the information, concerning Government demands.upon the trade.    It was estimated that this information could not be obtained within much less than two months, and the following Bosolution which I am to submit for your consideration was therefore passed:-&quot;That the Board ur&amp;jrtakes to submit before 30th September proposals for&apos; fixing the quota and to provide the men to complete the agreed quota between 1st October and 31st December, 1918&quot;.The Board further considered the serious effect upon Government wool textilo sttpplies caused by the voluntary transfer of men from this industry to trades which are recognised as of national importance.    In orlor to prevent this drain upon tho trade and to stabilise the position, tho Board passed the following Resolution, which I oxa to submit for your consideration.&quot;That the; Ministry of national Service be asked to suspend at onee calling up notices issued or to be issued, for all occupations defined in the schedule to bo inclu Led in the scheme&quot;,The Board also considered the point, which you raised at the Meeting of the possibility of the present, proposals being quoted as a precedent by other organised trades., and I am directed to state that the Board are not ware of any other industry of equal size and Importance, over 80^ of the output.of whioh is engaged upon Government work, which has not already received treatment at least equal to that provided in the proposed scheme, and they submit that the wool textile trade is not analogous to other trades. e.c. Gotten engaged mainly on civil production.-I am to add that members of the Board appreciate the manner in which you have met them, and your evident desire to work in accord with the trade.     They further.thank you for your   &apos; willingness to place their views as expressed in this communication before the Minister of National Service,I am to add that they would much appreciate an early, reply as they are anxious to reconstitute matters on a basis satisfactory to all concerned.I am, .;-Sir, ./\Your obedient Servant,Secretary to the Board of Control.IMUMchoci iisqv,Commissioner for Trade Exemptions, Ministry of National Service, Victoria Street, SV.7-.1,
