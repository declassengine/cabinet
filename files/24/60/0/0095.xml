month of July was 69 vessels of 441,652 tons deadweight launched and 42 vessels of 238,707 tons deadweight completed. COAL POSITIONThere is no improvement to report in the very unsatisfactory coal position referred to in paragraph 8 of my letter of the 5th instant.   The matter is engaging the anxious attention of the Departments concerned, and it Is hoped that suitable measures may soon be devised to relieve the situation. SUGAR SHIPMENTS.In 1918 it has been possible to develop the policy of concentrating upon Cuba, the nearest source of supply for Western Europe, to a still greater extent than last year.   In spite of the dearness of the Cuba market, an important saving of tonnage is thereby effected and the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply has accepted the necessity of doing so and has given this Department every possible assistance.The supplies for 1918 will consequently be drawn to the extent of nearly 80$ from fiuba.The balance of requirements will be made good from the West Indies, with a small quantity from Peru and Mauritius
from which latter source It has been agreed to lift 50*000 tonsof the present crop.No steamers have been specially allocated to load in Javathis year, and only one liner has loaded on the berth-Concentration upon Cuba has led to very heavy arrivalsIn recent weeks, but it has hitherto been possible to deal withall vessels as they have arrived without delay.IRON ORE POSITIONThe position in regard to tonnage for Iron Ore Isdifferent from that which prevailed this time last year.There was then a marked shortage of tonnage in the Bayof Biscay for which it was possible to compensate by heavyshipments from the Mediterranean.During the early part of this year the volume of tonnagein the Bay haa been greater, with the result that stocks of IronOre in North Spain have been cleared up and it is estimatedfor shipmentthat not more than 200,000 tone a month will be available /feeduring the remainder of this year,although tonnage would be available to lift a much larger quantity.   These ships will in consequencehave to return in ballast.It has only been possible to ship this large quantity ofOre from North Spain by taking advantage of the summer weatherto clear away deposits at the exposed loading places.   The
28Ministry of Munitions assisted this process by a special pur-chase of Ore at Povona,;As regards the Mediterranean,, opportunity of loading frcra the open roadsides in Algeria during the summer weather hasalso been taken and this has t% seme extent diminished thesquantity of shipping sent to South Spain.The Mediterranean tonnage is largely dr&amp;^n upon for long soa services and the allocations for ore are not likely to be hoavy.,Iron Ore from Narvik.   The imports during the winter months were low but opportunity has been taken during the summer months to ship the utmost possible quantity by the British vessels employed in the Anglo Norwegian Coal Trade,Four Swedish vessels obtained through the Swedish Tonnage Agreement which were specially constructed for the. Narvik Ore Trade have been put into this service *A certain number of vessels have also been sent out in ballast when there was delay in the supply of cargoes of coal.The shipment of miscellaneous minerals from the Mediter-ranean has proceeded satisfactorily.The requirements of Pyrites have been rather more than ful-filled and tonnage will be allocated in Norway for whatever
quantity is available.As regards Calamine and sine ores, tonnage would be made available for heavier shipments if the material could be sup-plied.   It is desirable to draw on Mediterranean sources to the full as resort to Australia involves a serious drain on tonnage.The vessels loading Magnesite at Euboea have proceeded in some cases through the Gulf of Corrinth to pick up parcels of currants fs*om Patras. AMERICAN TROOPINGThe total number of American troops embarked in British controlled tonnage during July was approximately 188,000 and the grand total in British and American controlled tonnage 305,000, l.e. 61.8 per cent were carried in British con-trolled tonnage.STORES FOR THE BRITISH ARMY IN PRANCE.jlll.II . ii iluimii,.!!-   I ii mi i Wi] i.i.      ii  i k. ih.ii in ii mm in j   i i Hi i mi 111 i in l    -rum &apos;i        him minium-     IT run        &apos;i innfVFor the week ended 3rd August, 156,836 tons of military stores were discharged in Prance.
