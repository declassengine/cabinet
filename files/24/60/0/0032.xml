0103/G.2T./478War Cabinet.Co-ordination of work connected with Prisoners of War.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for far.With reference to War Cabinet 451 (12), I circulate a memorandum by the Army Council, together with a note byMr Hope*MILKER.5th August, 1918,The prisoners of war question has now assumed an acute form.    In the main the difficulty lies in the direct tier, of securing one definite authority to whom all problems requiring authoritative solution should be addressed.    This difficulty has been obvious recently in the House of Commons and has been emphasized more than once by the questions which have been put.    Generally questions are answered by the war Office, Rome Office, foreign Office or the Honourable Member for Central Sheffield as representing the Prisoners of War Department.    The members of both Houses, particularly of the House of Commons are at a loss to know to whom any specific question should be addressed.    This uncertainty causes a feeling in the public mind that things are not as they should be,    Further, there is no doubt that the settlement of prisoners of war questions is at present gravely hampered delayed by the number of departments concerned and by the difficulties of negotiation and in certain cases, the absence of negotiation, between the several appropriate departmente concerned.It might be well to state shortly what these depart-menta are,1.    The foreign Office because they are particularly ooncerned with&quot;contraband&quot; and supplies and with the welfare tt civilian prisoners in enemy hands.    AH comnunications^with foreign powers whether Allied, hostile or neutral, have to be drafted by them,2.    The Home Office who are concerned with the intern* sent or releasfTa-nd the repatriation of enemy aliens in the United Kingdom.    They also administer, that is provide food, accommodation, clothing, stores and canteens for all campa in the Isle of Han.    The Scottish and Irish Offices arc similarly concerned with the internment of enemy aliens in Scotland and Ireland but their powers are, I believe, in practice exercisod by the Hone Office.3,    The Colonial OffiGO&apos; who represent the Dominions and Colonies and are responsible for the&apos; various problems which arise there regarding prisoners of war.    They send all our orders, viz. Army Council instructions, etc to the Dominion Governments and to Colonies where there is no irilitary Governor, Such orders are sent direct from the War Office where there is such a Governor.
4.     The India Office who act in tbe*-aeaw?-^y for India as the Colonial Office does for the lyoninions,    xke$       aiin, intimately concerned with prisoners of war of the Indian Army in enemy hands, &quot;but virtually they work through the war Office in taring, any Be^DXir^d.5*     The Admiralty, who are interested in naval captures, all questions oF sea -craiisport which are numerous, and of National Sea Law, as well! as in men of the Royal Navy and Mercantile Marine who are in enemy hands and in the charge of prisoners of war interned in Holland other than those trans-ferred to that country from Germany.6.    The Board of Trade who are primarily concerned with * officers and men of the Mercentile Harine in enemy hands. Their views and those of the Admiralty have not always coincided,.7.    The Ministry of National Service who control the employment of prisoners of war labour in the United Kingdom.8.    The Post Office and Treasury who have to be consulted as regards facilities and monetary.exchange,9,    The War Office who are responsible for the general administration of all camps for prisoners of war and interned civilians throughout the Empire and for the promulgation of all orders.     Our Army Council Instructions unless applicable only to the United kingdom are distributed everywhere,    We also deal with all questions of general policy.    As the bulk of prisoners in the Empire and in enemy hands are military and any question regarding them which affect our own or our Allies forces or those of the enemy are almost entirely-military, the War Office is far more concerned with the matter of prisoners of war than any other department.Besides all these there is the Prisoners of War Department which was formed for reasons which we need not enumerate as a semi-separate establishment of the Foreign Office.    The Foreign Office, as we understand it, took the view that they musi refuse to be the mere framers of Notes to Germany and the Central Powers laying down lines of policy with which they might be in entire disagreement.With so many departments interested in the subject it was natural that it should have been a matter for dis-cussion before the War Committee as it then was and the present War Cabinet.    We would refer to the extract of the proceedings of the meeting of the War committee held on &apos; Thursday, October 26th, 1916, in which the Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is stated to have contended that the Department that exercised the power should take over the responsibility as he thought it unfair that the Foreign Office should be held responsible for carrying out a policy with which they did not concur.&quot;The War Committee agreed that the beat arrangement was that the Prisoners Department should be solely under lord Newton, who would, answer all questions arising in the House of Lords.   Tftere should also be a Eember of tho House of Comiijene appointed to answer all questions in that House, under the guidance of Lord Newton, other than questions relating to the conditions of internment of civilians in the UnitedKingdom.
Kingdom.     In all mattero connected with the War Office Lord Newton would first consult them, and in case of any difference of opinion involving questions of policy, the matter should he &quot;brought &quot;by him in tho last resort before the War. Committee.&quot;The Foreign Off led would no longer &quot;be in any way responsible for the policy pursued with regard to prisoners of war.    Its functions would be confined to the carrying on of communication with Foreign Powers, and particularly with the American Embassy, in accordance with the wishes of the Prisonors Department&quot;.The situation was again discussed by the War Cabinet on Wednesday, March 20tify 1918, (War Cabinet 368 (14)) when memoranda by Lord Newton (G..T.3900) the Secretary of State for Home Affairs (O.T. 39G8) the Secretary of Sfrate for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty (G.T.3973) were submitted,,    Lord Bobert Cecil stated that departmental obstacles v/ere frequently encountered in connection with any fresh proposals for dealing &quot;with prisoners of war, and he thought it was desirable v/hon the , less important matters of policy were involved to leave them to some small executive authority.    The War Cabinet decided that in cases of departmental disagreement concerning prisoners of war not involving high matters of policy, lord Curzon should act on behalf of the War Cabinet at the request of any of the departments concerned.It was therefore clearly contemplated that the War Cabinet, which was the sole and supreme authority over the numerous&quot;-departments mentioned with thoir varied and very often conflicting interests, should delegate its authority to a Minister of cabinet rank.    This has been a gresft step in the right direction towards tho solution of the problem, but it is essential that something more should be done to secure a united policy and swift and effective action.    The great difficulty at present is that in practice questions do not come before Lord .  . Curzon until weeks have been spent in controversy and a deadlock has been reached.It has been suggested that a Hinistry should ho formed, but this proposal has a great many disadvantages, not the least being that the Government will be accused of creating more placemen, and also the difficulty ef staffing and accommo-dation which would mean much time and delay.    Nor would it be easy to induce the various departments concerned to part with their respective jurisdictions over the various classes of prisoners, whether British or enemy.    Much time would be taken up and very likely considerable friction would be caused.On the whole the best proposal would appear to be that a Standing Committee should be set up representing all tho departments concerned.    This committee should meet at loast twice a week under a Chairman, to whom if not already of Cabinet rankt full authority should be delegated by the Cabinet,If
If he is not himself -a member of the War-Cabinet, which would be best, he ought to be of sufficient status to,have easy access to the Cabinet and take its instructions in case of necessity.    wliat must be emphasized io, that in view of the number and complexity of the questions with which he will have to deal, it is of prime importance that his duties as Chairman of the Committee should have a first charge upon his time;   indeed, that it should be a whole time appointment.    This proposal has the advantage that it can bo immediately adopted;   that it will require little extra staff or accommodation;   that it will not upset existing arrange-ments;   that it will bring together the various departmental point of view and will enable quick decisions to be taken by a responsi-ble Minister who will be directly provided with first hand information.Very frequently difficulties arising from lack of co-ordination crop up, which a Committee of this nature could solve and the solution of which would thus be known to all the parties concerned.The following are instances of this lack of co-ordina-tion which have had injurious results.The Austrians have transferred or lent to Turkey a number of Serbian prisoners of war in Austrian hands.    They are ill-treated, unpaid and in peril of starving.    The French Government proposed that the Allied Governments should take reprisals upon Austrian prisoners of war in Allied hands.     It has hitherto been the policy of His Majesty1o Government, a3 far as we are aware, to keep apart all questions of prisoners of war as between ourselves and the enemy from prisoners of war questions between our Allies and the enemya     In one instance we lent German prisoners of war to the French whereupon the Germans moved many of our men to Courland where they suffered great hard-ships and privations.    As a result we were compelled to bring the Germans we had lent to France back to this country:     The idea of retaliating-^n prisoners of war in our hands to ensure better treatment for those of our Allies was adopted seme time ago by the Foreign Office without consulting us.    fj.:he Foreign Office,with, we think;: the consent of the Colonial Office issued instructions that correspondence to or from German prisoners of war and civilians not interned in territory occupied by us was to be stopped because that of the population of Belgium was much restricted if not entirely stopped by the Germans.    This led us into considerably difficulty recently at the Hague, and we understand that it is now contemplated to cancel to a large extent, this restriction.The question of following this precedent obviously demands the consideration of the highest authority,     It is a two-edged weapon and may be utilised by the Germans or any other belligerent to retaliate   on British prisoners because of some real or imaginary bad treatment of their subjects by one of our\numerou3 allies,     It might be worth while, in view of a case of this kind, and particularly in view of the repa-triation agreement between France and Germany to consider whether the Adjutant-General!s branch of the Supreme War Council at Versailles should not be specially instructed to watch all prisoners of war questions which affect the Allies.Again,
Again, there is this problem at home.     The position of enemy civilian prisoners of war and interned aliens is not satisfactory.     The camps in which they are confined are under military officers who receive their instructions partly from the War Office and partly from the Home Office, while the guards to such camps are soldiers acting under the orders of the Military Authorities.     The Home Office corresponds with the Military Commandants of these camps and a divided control is in existence which is eminently unsatisfactory. These men cannot be compelled to work, but can volunteer to do so.     It has been suggested that such enemy civilians as may be left after the coming exchange takes place should be interned in one or two camps and that they should be administered and guarded entirely by the Civil Power under the direction of the Home Office and have nothing whatever to do with the Military Authorities either for administra-tion or for safe custody9     It should be comparatively easy to arrange for this by making the Chief Constables of oounties where camps are located responsible and giving them sufficient special constables to maintain the necessary guards,Many problems of this kind come up for settlement and they can only be settled successfully and quickly by such a Committee as we have indicated,I.M.The above was drafted by Mr Macpherson with a view to its being signed as a joint memorandum from him and from myself.     I have only had a few minutes to consider it and I cannot on the spur of the moment make myself responsible for everything in it,     I entirely agree, however, with the main suggestion that a regular interdepartmental Committee should be set up to consider all prisoners of tfar questions under the chairmanship of a minister who should have Cabinet authority delegated to him to settle points of difference between the Departments,     I think this essential and have already put the matter forward in a memorandum written at the request of Mr Law.     I also agree thai it is o,f prime importance that this duty of co-ordinating departmental views should be the first charge on the time of the Minister appointed.J*F.H.1,0.10.
