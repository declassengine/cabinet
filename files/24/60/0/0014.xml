x CP&quot;&quot;if&apos;/-roperty ofN &apos; HQUS12JG OP TID3 WGKKIKG CLASSES ATOR THS WAJLyfcr:-rjramj^dum &quot;by the President of the Local Government Board.I have received this morning the Memorandum (Q.T.5282) of the Minister of Beconstruction, and think it desirable to place on record a reply to the main points raised in it.In paragraphs 3 and 4 of his Memorandum, it is assumed that the 225 local authorities referred to in the Memorandum of the 26th instant (G.T.5S31) are all the local authorities who are preparing schemes.   This is not the fact; the 235 local authorities (now 265) are only those of whom, through correspondence, newspaper extracts &amp;c. received by them, the Looal Government Board happen to have heard.The Government proposals for financial assistance are necessarily complex and each local authority naturally desires to know what its position under the scheme will he. Hence reports from the financial advisers of looal authorities and from their surveyors and consideration by committees have been necessary in nearly every instance.   These have taken time, the local authorities&apos; staffs being very short and much engaged on other duties.   There is also evidence that bites are being sought, the Local Government Board in their letter of the 18th Maroh having drawn particular attention to the necessity for preparing aohemes in connection with actual sites.Again there is evidence that many other looal authorities are hesitating because they think that by doing so they may induce the Government to offer more favourable terms. They have certainly received some encouragement in this view. Such authorities are naturally waiting to see the result of the action of the Munioipal Corporations Association whioh only conveyed its views to me on the 2nd ultimo.Paragraph 6.   I cannot accept the suggestion that private enterprise will not make any substantial contribution on the existing terms.   If the terms offered to local authorities are in fact offered to certain largo employers of labour, e.g. colliery companies, shipbuilders, &amp;c, I have good reason to believe that in many oases they will be willing to provide houses if they are not encouraged to hope that better terms will be forthcoming.   These employers must have housee for their workmen and if they form publio utility societies, for which they find the small amount of the capital which they cannot borrow from the 8tate, the fact that they will reoeive little interest in respect of it will not deter them from proceeding with the erection of houses whioh are as necessary to them as any other part of their plant,I have also another scheme for assisting private enterprise, which I have laid before the Treasury, which I hope may help to revive private enterprise after the war, particularly in those areas in which it is the habit of the working man to buy his house.Paragraph 7,   I agree that there are certain looal authorities who are opposed to municipal housing.   I do not think that they are &quot;a large number&quot;.   These local authorities, however, for the most part recognise the importance of having adequate housing for their diatriot and are more ready than others to assist private enterprise to renewed activity.P.T.O.
Birmingham is an enlightened example of theoe authorities.The Minister  of Heo on at ruction auotes Canterbury and Gateshead as places where there is a great shortage of housee and where there ie no intention of preparing schemes.   In the oa.se ef Canterbury the shortage ie largely due, 1 am informed, to&quot;the action of the military authorities who required aococsno-dation for troops.   It is also to be borne in mind that the population of the City hae been deolining for many years.Gateahead ie already fully built up and ie to a considerable extent a dormitory for other areas the Councils of which are proposing schemes which will relieve the position in Oaieshead.1 mention oome of the circumstances of these oases because they are quoted as instances of inaction by local authorities who ought to act, and to emphasise the necessity for the-careful investigation of the facts which I am moving in these and similar oases.   I should perhaps add that Canterbury Town Council have not in fact declined to aot but express them-eeives unable to satisfy themselves at the moment that there will at the end of the Var be any need for action on their part.1 do not, however, contest the aosumption that there will be some local authorities who will need ooercion or super-vision.   1 have never done bo.   My objection to the Minister of Reconstruction *s proposal is that it is premature to try to paee a large coercive measure until you know the extent of the need for it.   A measure such as that indicated in paragraph 9 -0- the Ministers Memorandum would be bitterly opposed in both Houses of Parliament.   Uy view is that most local authoritios can be induced to do what is necessary in the direction of building and that the time to take drastic powers is when that majority have shewn the way to the less enlightened and when it will be dearly seen that coercion will be limited to the few defaulters.   In this way opposition will be minimised.   This to my mind is a better policy than uniting in a formidable opposition the various local authorities Associations by a premature application for powers whioh I certainly hope and believe will prove ncoeosary in very few oases.I would add, as regards the last paragraph of Dr, addi3on&apos;s Memorandum that I think he underestimates the effect whioh Clause 1 of my Housing Bill will have on the position in agricultural areas end the possibility of action by landowners forming themselves into public utility societies.   Landowners have lortg been accustomed to the position in which they get no interest on the money they spend on cottages.X m opposed to house building by the State as undeeir-able in itself and uneconomical in practice, but I have never shut my eyes to the possibility of its being forced upon ua in a few cases.  My policy ie directed to minimise their number as far ae possible.W. HAKES F1SHKR.Local Government Board, Whitehall,2nd August, 1918,
