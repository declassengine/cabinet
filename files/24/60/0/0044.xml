CONFIDENTIAL. (August 2, 1918).Q2*!S Document Is the Property jis Britannic iyiaiestv&apos;s Govern ..     ,Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office,Bulgaria /002K E M 0 R A N D U MonTHE BROAD LIKES OF A BTOi! SETTLEMENT.The following suggestions are put forward with a view to providing a framework within which a concrete British policy and propaganda with regard to the different countries of the Balkans may he fitted.It may he taken for granted that the policy of bargaining with different Balkan countries in turn and offering them concessions con-sidered likely to &quot;bring about a favourable change in their policy for the moment, irrespective of the offeefcs of those concessions on neigh-bouring countries and on the whole question of a general Balkan settlement, is no longer, if it ever was, to be considered feasible. Quite aoart from the considerations of general principle;   quite apart from the foot that the war aims of the Entente since the fall of the Russian Autocracy and the accession of the United States to the Alliance are necessarily being identified more and more with the de-sire for the application of certain broad principles of democracy, national self-determination and international agreement, it is to-day perfectly clear that in the concrete case of Bulgaria (the country we are now specially considering) the British Government and fts Allies are at a great disadvantage ae compared with the Central Powers from the point of view of the offer at the present moment to Bulgaria of definite territorial concessions.     As a result of this war Bulgaria is ts-day in military occupation not only of both the uncontested and conteeted zones of Macedonia, but oi the whole of &quot;^omoraviye, i.e., Serbia East of the Morava River, and of a great part of Western Siberia up to a line running just North-West of Prizren, Prishtina and
Wish. sFurther, Greek Macedonia uo to the Strum is in her possession and, according to the rejected assertions of members of the Bulgarian Government, has been definitely promised to her by Germany,     Lastly, her old frontier in Dobrogea has been formally restored to her by the new treaty of Bucarost, together with considerable &quot;frontier rectifi-cations&quot;, and there is little doubt that, provided she adopts a satis-factory conduct towards the Central Powers with regard to economic questions and her attitude towards Turkey, Bulgaria will eventually be ceded the whole of Dobrogea up to the St. OeDrge&apos;s mouth of the Danube.     Hot even the most convinced friend of Bulgaria in this country could contemplate or suggest the offer to Bulgaria of terr-torial terms equal tt these and, further, any oifers we could make would be obviously inferior &apos;t* those of Germany, for the Central Powers, in alliance with Bulgaria, are actually in occupation of the territories which they can cede.But ii the Entente Powers are at a disadvantage in negotiating with Bulgaria fro^ the point oi view of immediate territorial policies they have, on the other hand, two obvious afcd considerable advantages over the Central Powers from the point of view of future relations.     One of these&apos;is political, the other military, both intimately connected and both together may be summed up as our desire to secure a future of free a id prosperous develooment for the Balkan nations as a whole, and^ necessarily, Bulgaria among them.     The Germans can indeed offer Bulgaria territorial concessions at the cx-pense of her neighbours:   they can offer Bulgaria the prospect of a military and political hegemony over the- other countries of the * Balkans.     But every thinking Bulgarian must be aware that not only is this oromised hegemony absolutely dependent on the final victory of the Central Powers - which is at least questionable - but that if it were to be brought about Bulgaria, in order to maintain it, must throw herself more and more into the arms of Germany and Austria-Hungary,
\ The vfcctory of the Central Powers might indeed mean a Bulgarian hegemony \ m the Balkans, but this hegemony she could only exeroise as a vassal of ; the Central Powers,   From the economic point of view the seme arguments i hold good.     Bulgaria,as the connecting link between Central Europe and the Turkish Empire might indeed, as Herman propagandists frequently point out, play a very important economic role in the future, but the very development of her resources under these conditions would make her bo . dependent on the financial and military resources of the Contra 1 flowers that her territorial end economic expansion would, in fact, bo a move not in the direction of greater independence, but of increasing subjection to thorn.     Since the disappearance of Imperial Russia ad a Great Power, Bulgaria has lost a counterweight which opportunist Bui-garian politicians insisted could always be opposed to any undue German predominance.    As politicians like Mr. Malinov and Mr. Geshov have argued since Bulgarian intervention in the war, Germany can help Bulgaria to achieve her territorial designs in the Balkans, and Russia will always be willing to forgive her and prevent the Germans from ob-talning the debt of gratitude she owes them should they claim it.On the other hand, the Entente Powers have presumably no sinister designs of either exploiting Bulgaria economically merely for their own advantage or of using her as a convenient instrument to hold the Bal-kans in their interest.     It is the wish of the Entente Powers not to establish the opredominance of any one power in the Balkans;   not to supoort certain national or economic interests unfairly against all others there;   not to disunite but to join the Balkan -nations in some real of form of Balkan Confederation such as in the past they have all at least pretended to desire.    The Entente Powers, therefore, have th*:; advantage over their rivals that they can aooroaoh the questibn without-being shackled by the encumbrance or endufcing the odium of attempting to acouiro for themselves advantages at the expense of the 3alkan peoples.   Moreover, they oan treat tho Balkans not only as a single
.oblcm, but as part of the greater problem whioh, unlike the Central offers, they are able and willing to open up:   that of the politioal (distribution of all the peoples of South-Eastern Europe according to lie equitable lines of arrangement in national unite so far as this is be wish of the populations concerned.    The Entente Powers have the dventage that they can approach the questions of Serbia and Rumania ot merely from the hopeless point of view of attempting to adjust heir Balkan ambitions on opportunist lines, but can, with an entirely ree hand, offer a solution of^the whole Question on which the future f these two peoples as great and progressive States depends.     If onoe he Jugoslav question reached a solution on the lines desired by the tugoolav people themselves;   if once the artificial political divisions uto which the Rumanian oeople ore split are swept away and the wnanians offiped an opportunity of solving once and for all the        i wsticn of their national union, then Jugoslavs and Romanians alike-lay be expeoted and, if necessary, persuaded to aporoaeh the thorny aestien of their relations with their Balkan neighbours in a more tnerous and conciliatory spirit than we have yet had the right to mmd from them.     It would be only fatr tthat the reconstructed %oslavia and Greater Rumania should be willing to abandon the terri-sriai claims in Macedonia and Southern Bobrogea respectively which hey put forward not on real racial grounds, but on grounds of military eourity end the necessity of maintaining the equilibrium of the alkans.It is then, truly in the Interest of Bulgarian national aspira-lons that they should admit and support the achievcaefct of the itional aspirations even of their hated neighbours.    A favt far-ighted and reasonable Bulgers may admit as much at present to them-elvcs,. though it would be too much to ask that they, any more than rbs or Rumanians, should be willing to oede territory before they n be assured of compensatory gains.    The development of this frume
f mind must be left to time and to the honesty and skill of Allied, jiplomacy.     But everi if this desirable end should be achieved, objec-tions might be raised, and fairly, from the Bulgarian side as to the prejudice which might thereby be done to their position in the Balkans. These objections might be of a double character. (1)   Bulgarians might fairly say;    &quot;You and our enemies have in the past insisted, often to the prejudice of our notional aspirations, that it is necessary to maintain an equilibrium of forces in the 3ulkans.     Now you propose the creation of a Jugoslavia and of a Greater Rumania of some eleven to twelve million inhabitants each. As a&amp;ainst this you oromise ust under certain conditions, the accep-tanCe of the principle of our national unity.     3ut even if this is achieved we shall at most be a nation .of some six millions.     How can you expect us to work for an end which will reduce us from the first place in the Balkans - a position which we at present temporarily hold - to the third or even fourth?&quot;.To this it may be replied that the principle of self-determination of peoples is not only one which it oleases us temporarily to champion in order to secure victory in this war, but one which we conceive it in the interests of ourselves and the world as a whole permanently to   -enforce in order to maintain the peace of the world.     The fact, then, that Rumania and Jugoslavia would oossess a greater population than Bulgaria would not enable them to press territorial or other claims against Bulgaria to her detriment, for their very possession of their own national unity would be made by the powers of the world conditional on their acceptance of the same principle for others.    A Bulgaria of  six millions, in fact, guaranteed and supported by the powers of the world, would be a stronger power than the inflated Bulgaria of the present moment, dependent for her existence on the military support of such dangerous protectors as Germany.
11 pi? 1*3 (jI I1(2)   The Bulgarian people are, above all, ajnfl may wo 11 bo dis- Iluieted ee to their economic prospects in future.     They can hardly expect to oossess ldb-thin their country directly the resources which jould exist in a reconstituted Jugoslavia or in a Greater Bum^iV-.   But, in fact, under any equitable settlement of the Balkans and Europe in general it would be desirable and even necessary to secure the establish-jent of such economic relations and intercourse between the different I &quot;* !I Balkan countries as &quot;would, in fact, conduce to the prosperity of eachIand all.     Bulgariafs oentrol position in the Balkans, the fact that she&apos;1 Ilies across the tv/o main trade routes Belgrade-Constantinople and Belgrade h&amp;loniki (presuming that such e settlement finally admitted Bulgaria&apos;s incorporation of at least the uncontested zone of Macedonia) would make It essential for Serbia and Rumania to secure her adhesion to any economic jarrangements they might make for the future in their own advantage as well is hers.     It would be found, in fact, that any settlement of Bouth-iactern Europe on the lines of   justice and nationality would result in dicing the various Balkan States dependent to a large extent on one mother economically.     Jugoslavia with a long Dalmatian coastline wouldIffer great advantages to Rumania, especially to little tyallachia and theItonenian Banat, as a country of economic transit to the Adriatic. I Similarly, Bulgaria would not only be essential to Jugoslavia and harts of r-reater Rumania a&amp; the shortest fcoute to Constantinople andsia !&apos;inor, but would in her turn find it convenient to deflect the jfade cf her Western territories through Jugoslavia towards the Adriatic tad the Banubian and German States.     Again, with frcece.    Greece willresumably keep Saloniki and probably Ksvalla, but both .ports are uso-jess to her, nor, indeed, can she be conceived to have any right to them pises they are to act as geography has meant them to act, as the out-&apos; fps for the trade of Macedonia and t *o Bulgarian hinterland.     Just ast would be in the interest of an Italy that won Trieste&apos; not to closeat open that port to the trade of Austria and Jugoslavia, so it would be
mill *&apos;Iin the true interest of Greece to offer the most advantageous terms to Bulgarian trade down the Vardar and Mesta Valleys.   It might, in fact, be a sine qua non of the settlement proposed that, whether the sea coast remains in the possession of a power different from that which controls the hinterland, the first power shall offer under international guarantees every necessary economic facility to the latter.     In the case of Saloniki and to a lesser extent Kayalla, the interest of Bulgaria would toe identical with that of Jugoslavia and even that of Rumania,Apart from these territorial aspirations (parts of Macedonia and Southern Dobrogea) which we are presuming that Bulgaria will eventually realise under the conditions outlined, Bulgaria may also well look for territorial advantages elsewhere.     If Turkey ceases to &quot;be in a real sense a European power, quite apart from the question of Constantinople - which it is not here proposed to discuss - there must be some successor to her in Eastern Thrace: geographically that successor can only be Bulgaria.   Bulgaria, conditional on her good behaviour now or in the near future, might well be assured of a free hand as regards Turkish Thrace up to the line of Enos-Midia or oven KIdia Rodosto.   This would not only present her with very adequate territorial compensation for the territories she   will bo compelled to disgorge, but would simplify the economic problems at present confronting Eastern Bulgaria. In what sense would such territorial re-distribution conflict withI   the principle of nationality?    It is indeed true that thepopulation of Eastern Thrace is very largely Greek on the coasts and Turkish in the interior.   As to the first,  reeks could hardly fairly raise an objection, as the annexation of these territoriesjl to Bulgaria would   be accompanied by the securing of Eastern Kacedonia, which has a considerable Bulgarian population in the interior, to Greece, and possibly Mr Venizelos&apos; idea of a gradual exchange of populations might be found workable.    As to the
It2 * 8 * 18 *Turkish population of the interior, every care should of course he taken to safeguard their religion and rights, hut as there has been on the whole very little tro, uble with the 500,000 or so Huhammadans of the present Bulgaria, there should be no reason to anticipate any very serious trouble with those of Thrace. The matter would, of course, require to be treated delicately and with due respect to the wishes of the populations concerned, but the solution proposed seems at least possible and not an unjust one.All these considerations would point to the creation at some future fate of a Zollverein in South-Eastern Europe which would be in the best interests of the peoples concerned and of the world at large.     It is, however, essential that whatever solution of the Balkan question is proposed, it should be a solution in accordance with the enforced by the wishes of the world powers.
