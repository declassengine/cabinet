I 7,     JERSEY POTATO SEASON,The following particulars, showing the comparative shipments of 1917/1918 during the Jersey potato season, are submitted.   From the opening of the season in May, 1917,   until the 29th September, 1917, 29,451 tons were shipped, whilst from the 20th May to the 19th July, 1918, 44,661 gross tons were shipped for the open market.    To this latter figure about 23,000 tons has to be added for Army requirements, and it is expected that a very small surplus will remain unshipped, after provision has been made for seed; out of the whole crop. 8*     COAL POSITION,The Coal position continues to be very unsatisfactory, the total amount available for export each week is still considerably below the minimum programme.
5,Shipments to France have increased in the past two weeks as the French ports have become less congested, but the shipments still remain below the minimum programme, and slightly below the receiving capabilities of the French ports,The Coal shipments to Italy however continue to be satisfactory, and in accordance with the programme, which, of course, is based on a very low supply as compared with Italy&apos;s needs.The shipments to the Scandinavian neutrals are suffering very seriously, and barely 50$ of the minimum programme is being reached.Shipments to South America are less than 50$ of the programme, and the Meat Works and South American Railways are likely to get into a very serious position unless more coal Is available.   A crisis has only been avoided by sending British ships in ballast from this country to the United Stated to load coal for South America.The French Government in the Mediterranean has received only 30$ of its requirements in July; and it has been necessary for the Admiralty to furnish coal from Naval stocks in the Mediterranean, although these stocks are exceptionally low.The Egyptian State Railways are about 40$ below require-
menta.   Efforts ara being made to arrange for them to get coal from -South Africa so as to relieve this country, but it will be some time before the effect of this can be felt in Egypt. 9.     MEDITERRANEAN TROOPING.The s/s &quot;HYPERIA&quot; lent to the French: Government for trie carriage of Algerian troops and horses in the Mediterranean has been sunk by enemy action.    Three other vessels have also been lent to the French Government for one voyage for trooping work in the Mediterranean. 10*   STORES FOR THE BRITISH ARMg IN FRANCE.- For the week ending 27th July 163,044 tons of Mill-taray Stores were discharged in France. 11.   HOSPITAL SHIPS.The sailings of hospital ships in the Atlantic are still suspended pending a decision as to the conveyance of Spanish Commissioners on board such ships. 12,.   SERBIAN HAY.This Ministry has agreed to carry to Salonica certain quantities of hay which the French Government had undertaken to lift for the Serbian Government.   The quantity to be carried in British controlled tonnage will amount to about 1,500 tons per month.
PROPAGANDA WQrtK.Five ships conveying American troops have arrived and have been disembarked at Bristol Channel ports for propa-ganda purposes.   Arrangements for the reception of the troops were made by the Municipal Authorities in consultation-^lth.4^ Kaval and Military Authorities at the respective ports..    De-tails of the proceedings were recorded In due course in the Public Press. HORSES FROM AUSTRALIA,The number of horses to be conveyed from Australia to India during the forthcoming season has been increased to 23,000 and arrangements have accordingly been made for the conveyance of that numberI am.Sir,Your obedient Servant, ( Signed,)    JOHN AHDERSOiU
