The Dikuctor Gknkral.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1).Refertrtcf Aft,31et July, 1918.Sir,I beg to.submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 30th July, 1918vThe Weather.The continued wet weather during the past week does not appear to have done great damage to standing corn.1   A certain amount has been laid but not so seriously as to preclude the possibility of its being cut by binders.    A good deal of hay that had been cut but not stacked before the breaking of&apos; the weather will be of low quality owing to its having been exposed for so long a time to the rain,LOCAL   ORGANISATION   DIVISION.The Board have recently taken possession of Manor Farm (650 acres), Cottisford, Oxfordshire, the Executive. Committee preferring that action in&apos;this case should not.be taken by them.    The occupier, Mr, Whyte, holds a lease of the farm uiider Eton College and proceedings were taken for the determination&apos;of his tenancy in the latter part of 1917.     He, however, commenced an action in the High Court to have these proceedings declared illegal, and was allowed to continue In occupation on his expressing his readiness to cultivate in accordance with the Board&apos;s requirements.    The farm was visited In February, 1918, and a full report was sent to the occupier indicating the cultivation required.    Although the Executive
Committee, at the request of the Board, granted him credit forf purchase of implements, the requirements were not carried out,I the condition of the farm has become exceedingly bad.    The occupier refused to give up possession to the Board, and has nl been prosecuted and fined  25 and  10 costs.    The farm will br cultivated under the direct management of the Department. Drainage of hand.   The results of the work which has been carried out upon the River Birkett in Cheshire have been strikf shown during the recent heavy rains.   Land which has remained water-logged for many weeks nearly every year in the past is q\J dry at the present time,   A similar result has been achieved or, the Frodsham Marshes upon a farm which lies about a mile from tj outfall of the main arterial drain of the marshes.   The work hej was only begun this summer, and a further considerable Improveitf is hoped for as the work proceeds.    In Norfolk the Executive Committee are taking action under Paragraph (h) of Regulation 2&apos; with regard to arterial drains at West Dereham and Costessy.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. AllotmentsReports received from 1,182 districts show that 313,248 applications have been made for plots under the Cultiva of Lands Order, 1917, (No.2), and 288,107 plots containing 20,754 acres, have been provided.&apos;   During the week six local authorities have agreed to acquire, in addition to the area mentioned above, 74   acres (591 allotments) for next season.The Olympia Oil and Cake Company of Selling have agre to sub-divide 7 acres of land adjoining their works into 98 allotments to be cultivated by their employees.    The Company has also promised to allocate a portion of land amongst their employees for pig-keeping.At Coventry 90 acres of vegetables cultivated in gronf adjacent to munition works, and a considerable area of ground
whioh it is intended to break up for allotments, have been Inspected,   The produce of this centre is consumed by the canteens and the surplus is sold to the employees.    The cultivation shows capable management as regards the general arrangement, rotation and quality of the crops grown.At Ampthill (Beds.) Q0% of the 590 householders possess gardens, while in addition 380 persons are cultivating a total of 57 acres in allotments averaging about 24 poles each.The Department has started a series of lectures for allotment holders in the hfrme counties on autumn cropping and the storage of vegetable crops.Fruit Section.   Twenty-five tons of empty baskets were received from Holland on the 19th July.During the week 151 demonstrations in fruit and vegetable preservation were held in the provinces and exhibitions on this subject have been held in Derby and Nottingham.The total number of glas9 jars ordered from the Ministry of Munitions now amounts to 6,939,540, and the total number delivered up to June 29th is 3,543,456. Marketing, - Somerset.   The County Society is making progress and arrangements have been made for the opening of Depots in four districts.   It is proposed that the Society shall have a central distributing depot at Bristol. -Surrey.    Rapid progress is being made in this county.    The Committee is hopeful of raising a capital of at least  15,000, and arrangements are being made to open additional depots.   13 depots are already receiving produce.Cambridge.     The local market recently started at Cambridge sold 10 tons of vegetables in one day, bringing In a total receipt of  170.
TECHNICAL DIVISION. Wireworm in newly broker Grass Land,   A report has been preparedon the results&apos; of cultural treatment for the control of wireworm-(no leather jackets being present) in broken up grass land on th chalk in Sussex.     45 acres of oats were sown the last week in March and not pressed but repeatedly rolled after sowing.     The result was a partial failure on most of the field.     Of 20 acres sown about March 10th end treated as above, one-tenth failed. An excellent crop was obtained, however, from 20 acres sown duri the first week in March$ pressed by a special instrument, and repeatedly rolled after sowing.Tests of New.......Fertilisers. Of various substances recentlyinvestigated the best results have been given by &quot;activated sewage sludge&quot;, a preparation considerably superior to any ordinary sewage sludge hitherto examined.    The sample submitted was from the Manchester Sewage Works;   it contains over 6^ of nitrogen, and from the present appearance of the plants (which ai now being cut for weighing) the nitrogen appears to have practioi the same value as that in nitrate of soda.     The sludge is prepai by blowing air through the settling tanks.    The process Is at wi in Manchester, Worcester and St. Albans.     Arrangements have beef made to watch the St. Albans installation and to test the sludgej obtained to see if it gives as good results as&quot;the Manchester slJ Electrical treatment of Seeds.   An Inspection has been made of crops of corn and potatoes in Dorset grown from seed treated by 1 Wolfryn electro-chemical process.    The crops have been grown by farmers In the county, but not undor the supervision of the Department.   In several cases &quot;treated&quot; plots have been grown alongside &quot;untreated&quot; plots, thus giving something in the nature definite experiment,   The result of the treatment is in most cas*j apparent and is generally goocV    Arrangements are being made to secure the weighing of measured sample areas of treated and
untreated crops, and it is probable that definite experiments will&apos; be arranged next season at one or more of the agricultural institutions.     It may be stated that pot trials with treated seed were, started in the spring, but so far the results show little or no benefit from the treatment. Utilisation of Straw.   A conference has been held with the Paper Controller with reference to the possibility of using some of the surplus straw from this year&apos;s harvest in the manufacture of paper.     It is likely that the coal shortage, however, will prove an insurmountable difficulty, as three times the quantity of coal is required to produce paper from straw as from wood pulp. It is probable that the only industrial outlet for straw, apart from the ordinary manufacturing uses, is in the making of straw-boards, and it Is doubtful whether more than 200,000 tons of straw can be absorbed by this means.    The whole question of the disposal of the large surplus of struw in 1918-19 is under consideration by the Technical Committee.LABOUR DIVISION. Harvest Labour.   The&apos;number of men who have been released from Command Depots on one monthfs furlough for harvest work is now 1,123. ,   &apos;&apos;&quot; &apos;Arrangements have been completed in many counties for sending out the migratory gangs of German prisoners on which most reliance will have to be placed for additional assistance with harvest work.    The Department have made representations to the ^ar Office that the usual prisoner of war ration should be increased in the case of those prisoners who will be engaged for long working hours during the harvest. .  It Is understood that the military authorities will agree to some slight increase being made in this special case, in view of the&apos; importance of getting in the harvest quickly and the impossibility of men working long hours on hard manual work on the existing prisoner ration. Soldier Labour.   The number of soldiers now out on farms is 59,553.
War Agricultural Volunteers.   Information received by the IDepartment to date shows that 1,425 War Agricultural Volunare now working on farms, and it is expected that many othmen will be sent out during the next few days.    Arranger^have been made for all volunteers who have registered at tiLondon Employment Exchanges to be interviewed during thepresent week, with a view to any suitable men being placedfarmers at once.In view of the reports that are being received tloorn has been laid in some districts, Executive Committeeshave been instructed to make enquiries among the WarAgricultural Volunteers to ascertain how many men can Usethe scythe so that these men may be held ready to be sentto any district where their services are required for deal!with crops that cannot be cut with the binder.Prisoners of War.    Pour additional Agricultural prisonercamps have been opened during the week making the total nuof prisoners now employed on agricultural work as follows:!Prom 281 agricultural camps..............    16,41Employed from other oamps.................      1,(1Combatant prisoners lodged on farms......        i17751Released aliens employed in agriculture..      2,11Total.................In addition, 68- other schemes providing for the I employment of a further 4,150 prisoners in agriculture are!] under consideration by the War Office.The reports that have appeared in the press as women of the Women1 s Land Army and prisoners of war workinl on the same farm have proved on enquiry to have little or I foundation, but the attention of all Committees has again 1 been called to the fact that women of the Land Army should not work on the same farms as prisoners of war.    Gommitte!
o/hihave been instructed that they should not sanction applications for prisoner labour If women of the Land Army are being employed by the applicants.Sale of Horses Order. 1917*    As it is now twelve months since the &quot;Sale of Horses Order (1917)&quot; was brought into force, it may be useful to give a short account of the results of the working of this Order, which being somewhat of a routine character do not form a feature of this report week by week.This Order was brought into force on June 14th 1917, and provided that:-   &quot;An occupier of an agricultural holding in Great Britain shall not sell or part with the possession of any horse used or capable of being used for the cultivation of the holding, except with the authority of a licence granted under the Regulation.&quot;Up to June 30th 1918, 124,415 licences for the sale of horses had been issued by Agricultural Executive Committees, from which it would appear that the floating population of agricultural horses averages about 10,000 per month.    During the same period 7,555 horses were officially released from agriculture for essential trade purposes.A considerable number of cases of alleged contravention of the Order have been brought to the notice of the Department, in 127 of which proceedings have been in-stituted and penalties varying from 4/- to  100 imposed, the total in penalties amounting to  &amp;,227. 5. 6.    The Order being a Defenoe of the Realm Regulation, the police can take&apos; action without reference to the Department and there is reason to believe that many other prosecutions have been taken.The many representations which were made at the inception of the Order, to the effect that it was unnecessary, unworkable, would unduly limit the market for horses, thus
lowering prices and consequently having a disastrous effect on the horse breeding industry, have been falsified.    That Committees have come to recognise the expediency of the Order is indicated by the fact that in many cases they have imposed additional local restrictions.Experience, therefore, would appear to indioate that, having regard to the largely inoreased area of land now under cultivation, there is a shortage of horses for agriculture, essential trades and Army requirements, and that the Regulation in foroe have been fully Justified.WOMEN 1S BRANCH.graining and Employment.    Among the demands for women&apos;s labour recently received, one from Cumberland for the 20th August for 100 women for the harvest, another from Lincolnshire for 1,000 in September for potato lifting, and one from Kent for 100 women for threshing in August have been received.Three new working hostels have been started during tlweek.14,355 women are accounted for in the Land Army asfollows?*On Farm work............................. * * 10,452Lent to Forage Dept........................ 181Lent to Timber Supplies Dept............... 203In Instruction Centres..................... 2,701Waiting for references to be plaoed intraining centres................... 379Waiting in Depots......................... 212Waiting in their own homes................. 227Total.................. 14,355Women1s Institutes.    The Institutes are being circularised toy the Rural Housing and Sanitation Association, which is working I in conjunction with the Ministry of Reconstruction.    Institute have been asked to discuss the important question of rural    j housing, and to answer various questions on subjects requiring I elucidation.
k) hiCULTIVATION DIVISION, Tractor Scheme.   The following statement shows the position as regards the provision of tractors, machinery and implements for the week ended 27th July.     It should be noted that in accordance with the decision to restrict the types of tractors and ploughs in use, those types not to be retained are in process of being withdrawn.No. consigned Total No. to counties consignedduring week. to date.Tractors   ........- 4,214(8 withdrawn) 5,128Ploughs.........             4 5,128(211 withdrawn)Cultivators 9/11 tine       - 1,450&quot;          disc pattern   - 690Trailer boxes ......         7 954Up to 27th July, 1,269 of the Fordson tractors which have been released to Messrs. Henry Ford and Son had been dispatched to farmers.During the week ended 19fch July, 7,883 acres were ploughed, 1,227 acres cross^ploughed and 5,061 acres cultivated,. Horse Scheme. The following figures show the position with regard to the provision of horse-drawn implements for the week ended 27th July:-No. consigned Total No. to counties consignedduring week. to date.Carts and Lorries ....... 5 2,569Cultivators............. 2 1,399Di so Harrows............ 4 757Drills .................. 19 1,494Harrows and drags ....... 4&apos; 3,186Ploughs................. 36 5,323Potato diggers........... 72 229Rollers................. 1 2,038Steam Tackle. The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follows:- ploughed 2,105, cultivated 28,327, harrowed 549, mole-drained 257, rolled 230.   Total 31,468 acres.Several sets of tackle were reported idle owing to lack
of fuel and some anxiety is felt With regard to the supply of    &apos; steam coal for steam cultivation.     The matter is being taken up with the Coal Controller.Arrangements for 1918 harvest.   11 binders were consigned duringj the week ended 27th July making a total of 4,006 consigned to date.     In addition 6 combined mowers and readers were consigned making a total of 139 consigned to date.SUPPLIES DIVISION,iFertilisers. Up to thus present, makers of sulphate of ammonia ha been allowed, under a &quot;General.Licence&quot; to deliver quantities no j exceeding 20 tons to any one purchaser. In order to obtain additional control over supply and enable the needs of particula dealers to be met, it is proposed to restrict deliveries under t General Licence after the end of August 1918 to lots not exceed! 5 tons, each order, in excess of that quantity requiring a specia licence from the Department. This will not inconvenience maker in many cases they have not taken much advantage of the opportur, of delivering under their General Licence. In the case of basi slag, it Is proposed to withdraw the General Licence to deliver quantities not exceeding 25 tons and require all sales to be mad under a special licence. About 80$ of the output of basic slag for this year has already been licensed and the whole, of the remaining output will be reserved to meet the unsatisfied needs Approved Agents. It is also proposed to reserve the remaining output of sulphate of ammonia for disposal to Approved Agents, s what is required by mixers of compound fertilisers. Lime. In view of the difficulties in obtaining lime in the soul western counties, an arrangement has been made with a maker at Veston-super-Mare to meet orders forwarded to him through the Agricultural Executive Committee at a reduced price.    The
railway rates for delivery from these works to Devon and Cornwall are not excessive, and if the scheme is put Into practice farmers ought to be able to obtain lime at an appreciably cheaper rate then now exists.Testing of Seeds Order.   A Joint Committee of the three Agricultural Departments of the United Kingdom has now been set up to deal with the issue of licences under the Testing of Seeds Order.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Deputy Director-General.The Eft.-Hon.Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.,President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
