STiTOY.IStfc August, 1918.OOMMERCR AND INDUSTRY *djw This Bill has been passed by the House of1h to Commons and was read a second time in the House of Lords jpmy        on 31si July.etst&quot;^&quot; ^        extends and strengthens the provisionsif existing legislation relating to the winding*up of enemy businesses and prohibits the carrying on of banking business under tha control or for the benefit of subjects of present enemy states for a period of 5 years after the termination of the War, and thereafter, until Parliament otherwise determined.     Banking Business Is to be   defined by Rules and the definition fill be so framed as to include not only the business pi keeping current and deposit accounts but also.any business usually carried on by accepting and discount houseB and other financial operations of a similar Character.Orders have been made &quot;under the Trading with the Enemy Aots for the winding-u? of the businesses of the threes German and two Austrian banks which have hitherto been realising their assets and discharging their liabilities under the control of Sir William  lender. The Senior Official Receiver in Companies Liquidation ;has been appointed to wind-up these businesses.
268the shiPT)ing!controller has consented to allot a further 67,500 tens to cotton impvrUrikxs--year in addition to the increase of 60.000 tons recently promised.    this will bring the total allowance for cotton imports in 1918 to&quot;627,500 tons, or about 100,000 tons-less than in 1917.the decision of the cotton control board to % abolish the rota system aroused considerable opposition among the operatives (with the exception of the card and blowing-room operatives) and the president re-ceiji/ad a deputation &quot;from the united textile fectory workers association, which put before him the case- -against abolition and asked at the same time for unemployment benefit for short time.    at the instance of the preside the abolition of the rota system wa3 postponed a fortnight.    he subsequently made an announcement with reference to the points . raised to a meeting of the control Board..    the rota system is to     abolished on august 10th, and after taaM datj only workpeople continuously &quot;played off&quot; can he paid from the&apos;control Board funds, box  -the-number out of work will be reduced as a result of a,new arrangement by which american and mixed spinning mills will be allowed under licence to run odt of their total spindles on american cotton instead of 5C$, and at the same time abort &quot;time will be reduced by raising tha weekly hours from 40 to 45J:.    an increase in the percentage of spindles on egyptian cotton will also be allowed,   a similar arrange-ment is to apply to looms.   in addition the scale of. unemployment&quot; dayments will be increased by 20Z all round.    the refusal to take other work in districts away from their homes will not disqualify unemployed operatives for receipt of control board payment.-a definite understanding has now been come to with the french government by whioh the right of that government to limit the importation of sulphate of copper from the united kingdom to 25,000 tons during the coming season is recognised.    the board of trade will not licence the exportation of any particular consignment except where the exporter can produce a written approval of the french minister of agriculture,.   as however contracts for the season which began on july 1st have already been entered into in many cases, it has been agreed that this latter condition shall be waived ni regard to * any such contracts concluded prior to july $6th sub-jeot of course to the total amount 00 contracted for being less than 26,000 tons.for owing to tho serious damage inflicted by enemyaircraft on the soda ash factory at pombasle in france there has been an unprecedentiy large demand for the supply of this chemical, which (or its alternative
ATENTS TRADE HARKS.CauBtic Soda) is vitally necessary to the manufacture of High Explosives.      At the request of a representative of the French Government the Board of Trade have been in communication with Messrs. Brunner Mond and the United Alkali Companies with a view to arranging means for supplying the French requirements. Messrs, Brunner Mond have agreed to reduce temporarily their shipments to oertain other destinations and believe that with the help of the United Alkali Company they will be able to meet the French require-ments, which amount to 20,000 tons of Soda Ash, in the next three months.    Their doing so, is, however, to a large extent dependent on their being able to convert rapidly certain works, formally making Ammonium Hitrate for the Ministry of Munitions to the manufacture of Soda Ash. The Ministry of Munitions are agreed in principal, but we have had to communicate witb ire Treasury, who have raised certain difficulties in regard to financial aspects of the scheme.9 QThe gene country to send the grant regist and trade marks, similar payments enemy owners of cancelled.

The Enquiry will relate to the development and co-ordination of facilities and not to questions of ownership,PUBLIC SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. As the result of the decision arrived at by th$\
27,0War Cabinet on the 25th July on the-suhsleot of the supply of railway waggons for use in Italy, the Railway Executive Committee have, in agreement with the Coal Controller, taken steps to provide IX)tOOO railway waggons, whioh will he available for use in Franco.      The provision of these waggons wlUjiMaMjf French waggons to be sent to Italy,The number of railway waggons whioh have been supplied by British Railway  Companies for use in Praams will now amount to about 31,000.MISCELLANEOUS.IMPORT PROHIBITIONS.Important negotiations have been in progress during the month regarding the import of Swiss Silks and Embroidery.At the request of Ike Treasury it was decided to cease licensing with effect from August lfith.    Subse-quently the treasury authorised the Foreign Office to intimate to the Swiss Government that further licensing might be permitted if the Swise Government were to grant loans to the extent of the value of the silk and embroidery to be licensed.    A counter-proposal is oontemplated by the Swiss Government, and M. Carlin has asked that the Licensing should be continued after August 15th pending an  agreement.    The decision of the Treasury on this proposal is awaited.   Meanwhile the cessation of licensing of silk and embroidery from Switzerland is giving rise to protests in this country and in Switzerland.PAPER CONTROL.3qwffiisff Considerable&apos; quantities of paper-making materialsAGREEMENT   have been imported&apos; and paid for under the terms of the regulations.gjW SPRINT,In connection with the Swedish Agreement, an additional^,ration of .5,000 tons per month of paper-making material has been arranged, and, licences are &quot;being issued to the paper trade generally.A special ration, in addition to the 5,000 tons &apos;mentienad in the preceding paragraph, is to be allocated to the newspapers.    This also is at the rate of 5,QQ0 tons per month up to the end of the present year, and will be allocated pro^rata amongst the Morning and Evening Daily Papers, Weekly and Sunday Newspapers.The Department has purohased about 30,000 tons of. wet meohanioal pulp in Norway and 5,000 tons of sulphite pulp in Sweden on advantageous terms.
hi i Imi QOMTROL fOUTPUT. Extreme difficulty has &quot;been experienced duringthe past month in dealing with the demand for coalm &quot;both for inland consumption and for shipment, whichhas considerably exceeded the output.The effect of Influenza on output showed nc sign Of abating in certain districts, even towards the end of the month, the output at certain collieries being reduced by as much as&apos; 50$.   It is anticipated that the position wi31 be iraterially improved when the epidemic dies down, and when tne proposals for rationing industrial and household coal which are now well advanced are in operation. A serious feature however is that it will not be possible to make up loss of time in the natter of the accumulation of stocks for the winter.   In this connection it may be mentioned that only about 7,000 of the 25,000 lew gsade r-/V men promised by the War Office have so far been &quot;retu-med to the mines, and the War Office are being pressed to expedite the return of the balance.CES AffD The price of coal was increased by l/6 per tonas from the 5th July to meet the cost of the additional war wage of 1/6 per day granted to the miners as from the 30til June.At the same time an Order was made under whichwar WEg-e? ana to provide funds for so doing required the collieries to credit them with 4/- per ton on all coal disposed of on and after that date (being the total amount of the increasss in prices imposed in October last and in July to meet Ihe cost of the war wa^as;.   This insures that tho whole of the increases in piiocs granted to meet the cosit of the war wage shall be specifically applied to that purpose.The ircrea3e in miners&apos; wages has led to dissatisfaction among the clerical and administrative staffs, and the Coar Controller is in consultation on this matter with the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Munitions, who are also concerned.Surface workers, to whom the war wage was granted -on the zsm basis as to the miners, have made certain claims including the application of the war wa^e to overtime.  This has not,1 been agreed to as the war wage is regarded as a weekly allowance to meet the cost of living and not as a wage for work done.TIMBER SUPPLB5.The scheme for the central purchasing of softwoods, and distribution through the Imported Timber Trade, was brought into operation on July 22nd.TIMBER COMflL In addition to preparing for the Ifotionisg 0RDtR.l^l8      Scheme, this Order extends the permit system toRpfg.1918      Scheme, this Order.extends the permit system to home atedi .Julv 16thgrown converted timber and deals with otheT&quot; matters.such as the position of timber on estates which are tobe sold.

The permits will not authorise the holders to use petrol during their holidays, and will only be granted to persons whio hold current motor-spirit licences.An order was made by the Board of Trade suspending the provisions of the &quot;Motor &quot;Spirit (Consolidation) and 6as Restriction Order, 1918, in so far as they relate to the prohibition of the use of mo tor-spirit in private motor-vehicles&apos;or hirer-vehicles for the attendance at Bubble Worship, on Sunday, &quot;August 4th, between the hours of 6 a.m, and 10 p*m,, so as to permit suoh v&amp;icles to be used in proceeding to and from the nearest place of worship where ether reasonable means of conveyance are * not available.HORSE TRANSPORT.The supplies of hay tod straw for the feeding of Town horses are very low at the present time, and it has ooiisoguently been thought advisable to issue an Order rationing these commodities ^-on the same lines as Cereal feodstuffs are now ratited to Town horses. The Order also provides that all ohaff sWBLl oontain not less than one-third of straw and prohibits the use ofstraw for be da lag purposes,la order to conserve horse power for essential work and to reduce the consumption of foddor, an Order has been made prohibiting the use of Char**a-banos.
