Berry, Esq.TERMS  OF  REFERENCE.&quot; To obtain evidence in respect of the quantity of cannel coal and allied minerals available in Great Britain as a source of motor spirit, fuel oil, and other products, and to formulate a scheme for the utilisation of such supplies.&quot;INTERIM  REPORT  TO THE  COUNCIL OF THE  INSTITUTION OF  PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGISTS.1. On our appointment by you at the end of February last as a Committee for the purposes specified in the Terms of Reference, we commenced our proceedings by appointing from our Committee four sub-Committees as follows: &quot; A.&quot;  SUPPLIES OF MATERIAL.1. Quality of Material.2. Quantity of Material.3. Grouping of collieries for assembling material with a minimum of transport.4. Methods by which the maximum of retortable material can be obtained.
1.   Retorting, forms of retorts, etc. 2.   By-products, including residues. 3.   Refining of Oil.&quot;C.&quot;   COvSTS.1. Cost of raw material, including extra labour in mining and handling.2. Cost of retorting plant, erection and working.3. Cost of refining oil.4. By-products costs.&quot;D.&quot;   FINANCIAL SCHEME.1. Wages.2. Royalties.3. Value of Products.4. Drafting of Scheme.2. The possibility of obtaining oil in quantity from the low-temperature distillation of cannel coal and its cognates has been considered from two points of view, namely,(1) As an immediate war measure, having in view the production of motor spirit and fuel oil for the Services, and(2)  As a permanent commercial undertaking and a measure of Reconstruction.3. Sufficient evidence having been obtained from colliery proprietors and others to justify the conclusion that a very large amount of retortable material can be obtained for the production of oil in Great Britain, the Committee have decided to issue this Interim Report.  &apos;4,   The raw material in sight divides itself into three classes : (a) Non-caking material with a high yield of oil giving a residue of low value as household and steam raising fuel, but of considerable value for producer gas and other purposes;(b) Caking and non-caking material with a smaller yield of oil than (a), but affording a residue of great value for domestic and industrial fuel; and(c) Material of a variety intermediate between (a) and (b).5. As a result of tests carried out by various processes it has been established that a yield of between 15 and 80 gallons of crude oil per ton can be obtained from material existing in the British Isles. This crude oil can be refined to give at least 8% of spirit and 40 to 50$ of fuel oil.6. The Committee are satisfied that at least 10,000 tons per day of retortable material could be economically assembled for treatment provided the necessary facilities were given by the Government and the requisite labour were available. At an average of 30 gallons of oil per ton this would yield 300,000 gallons of crude oil a day or upwards of 400,000 tons a year.
7. Much of this material has hitherto been mined but not raised, or if raised has been thrown upon the spoil heaps or returned to the underground workings. If the substitution of the shovel for the fork, so strongly demanded by the miners, were made obligatory by Government Order, still more material would be sent up and wasted. If, however, the recommendations of this Committee be adopted and retorts erected, the increased supply pf material will be utilised and the colliery owner enabled to pay the miner for the extra tonnage brought to bank.8. The development of the industry as a permanent commercial undertaking depends upon the utilisation of the by-products and residues.9. The efficient utilisation by means of low temperature distillation of the heat energy of the raw materials employed will make available valuable constituents which now go to waste, and thus tend to relieve the shortage of fuel for domestic and industrial purposes.10. (a) The residues obtained from caking material will provide a consider-able supply of clean fuel without smoke, and of high calorific value.(6) The residues obtained from a non-caking material, high in ash, can be utilised in a producer for the production of power gas and sulphate of ammonia. The quantity of gas must depend on the relative proportions of carbon and ash in the residue, and consequently no generalisation as to the yield of gas is possible.(c) The residues obtained from a non-caking coal low in ash can be utilised in the manufacture of briquettes,11. it must also be borne in mind that the utilisation of the large quantities of residues obtainable from the treatment of non-caking material should greatly facilitate the schemes for the generation of cheap electrical power which have been the subject of consideration by the Electric Power Supply Committee of the Board of Trade and the Coal Conservation Sub-Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction.12. The Technical Advisers of the Committee have carefully investigated several types of retort, and also have had submitted to them many suggestions by inventors and others which hold forth considerable promise. As the materials to be treated vary widely in natural characteristics and in their behaviour within the retort, it is apparent that no one type of retort can treat to the best advantage all classes of material. There is, however, every reason to believe that certain retorts which have been under consideration will treat either caking or non-caking, bituminous mineral so as to give a satisfactory throughput. There are in existence retorts which will successfully recover the maximum oil content.13. The Committee have not overlooked the question of the labour which will be required, but they desire to emphasise the fact that the establishment of an industry for the low-temperature distillation of cannel coal and its cognates will afford many openings for the employment of unskilled surface labour.
Hon. Secretary:J.  Arthur Greene,  Esq.,Trafalgar Buildings,1 Charing Cross, LONDON, W.C. 2J. Cou-ARD, Printer, 43, Charing Cross Road, London, W.C. 214. The Committee regard with apprehension the situation as to the supply of fuel oil and motor spirit and the long delay in taking action to develop home supplies.   They, therefore, strongly urge  the adoption of the followingRECOMMENDATIONS :-(1) That the War Cabinet should be invited to lay down a definite policy for the guidance of the Departments as to the relative national value and importance at the present time of oil and coal, the provision of the necessary labour, raw materials and transport.(2) That the Government should afford all necessary facilities to those who are prepared to find the capital and take the risk fo rthe erection at suitable centres of plant for the treatment on a com-merciai basis of the material known to exist.(3) That an experimental station be established forthwith, so that retorts of any design provisionally approved by the Institution of Petroleum Technologists can be erected and tried out, and material tested with a view to ascertaining its character, oil yield and residual values.(4) That such experimental station shall be maintained by arid at the expense of the Government;or alternatively(5) That the Government shall afford all necessary and reasonable facilities to the Institution of Petroleum Technologists for the erection of a testing station of their own.For the Committee,R. W. Barnett,Chairman.2/\th July, 1918.
