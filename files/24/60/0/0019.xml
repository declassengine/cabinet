CONDITIONS AMONGST INTERNED OFFICERS AND MENCopy of letter from the Chairman, Joint War Committee, British lied CrossSociety and the Order o f.&apos; S t * ? ohn pT&quot; J e r us ale 5 in ijhiland, to Private Secretary to&apos; the rrime Minister.(Ciroulated with reference to &quot;Note of Statements and suggestions mad made by Miss Vulliarmy on conditions amongst Prisoners of War and Civilians in Germany and Holland. - G.T.5Q83).Dear Mr. Daviee,I know that Miss Vulliamy,. who has been working for the Prisoners in Holland, had an interview with Mr. Lloyd George the other day and from things I have heard I gather that she may have givon him the impression that the training of the interned officers &amp;n&amp; men was not being satisfactorily carried out by the Red Cross.    I think it is only fai* to our Commissioner, Mr. Voules, that I should send the Prims Minister a oopy of a letter which has been addressed to me by Captain Fitzgerald, an officer who has been assisting in our work in Holland and has just boon repatriated.     I think this will s&amp;ow that the work of Mr. Voulos, (our Commissioner in Holland), ie on a larger scale than was realised by Miss Vulliany, and the faot whioh is mentioned on the last page, that the Military Authorities drop a hint to the effect that &quot;if the.Red Cross did not slacken their efforts somewhat there would not be suf-xioient mon available for routine duties&quot; is surely ample ovi-denoe of the provision which has been made for the training of &apos; the officers and men.If you think it desir^le I shall be very grateful if you will kindly bring Captain Fitzgerald^ lettor to the Prime Ministers notlco.CABINET.83 Pall Mall, London, S.W. 30th July, 1918.Yours sinocrely,(Sd.)

Copy of. letter from Capt, J.S.Fitageraid, Royal Irish Regimentj to the Hon. A, Stanley, MiP.fyueen Alexandra&apos;s Military Hospital, flUbank, S.W.,29th July, 1918.Pear Sir ArthurX have just arrived in England from Holland, having been repatriated on medical grounds.     I learn to my astonishment that Miss Vulliamy, who was recently granted ah audience with the King, and who had an interview with the Prime Minister, is credited with having conveyed the impression that the British Prisoners of War in Holland are suffering from lack of employment; a statement of this nature can only be construed into a charge of inefficiency or incapacity against the British Red Cross Society which has undertaken, the organisation of employment, education and occupation in Holland on similar line3 to those adopted in the first place by the Society in Switzerland.     I hasten to assure you that any such charge is without foundation, is contrary to the true facts of the case and is flagrantly unjust towards the Red Cross, which has done so much to help the Prisoners of War.I admit that you may not regard me as an entirely impartial judge in the matter, as since February last I have been Military Representative of the British Red Cross Society in Holland, and in this capacity have been closely associated with the questions of employment and education.     I venture to think however, that any opinions expressed in this letter will be borne out by independent witnesses who are   conversant with&apos;the work in Holland;   I might mention in this connection the names of Brigadier-General Graham^Thomson, the Director of Prisoners of War in Holland, General Bruce, Senior British Interned Officer and the Baroness M.de Brienen.     Furthermore, the British Delegates who recently attended the Conference at the Hague will bear testimony te the Red Cross work there;   the various institutions were visited by them and the warmest appreciation was expressed.while bringing these facts to your notice, I should like at the same time to review briefly the work which is being done, and to touch on the great difficulties which had to be surmounted&quot;.As you are aware the task of employing and instructing, th* Prisoners of War was only undertaken at the last moment by the Rftd Cross;   that is to say there was little time for preliminary preparation before the Prisoners began to arrive in Holland from Germany.&quot;  Hr. Voules reached the scene of his labours as Commissioner of the R^d Cross in Holland shortly before Christmas and started without delay to erect huts for Carpenters, Bootmakers, Tailors etc.     As the Prisoners poured steadily into the Country a number of additional buildings were hired at Soheveningen and in the Hague;   even at this moment the expansion is steadily proceeding and to-day there are a large number of centres of activity which only require to be seen to ,be appreciated at their proper value.I need not recapitulate the various activities as you are well acquainted with them, but for purposes of a brief summary, the work ean be classified simply as :-Education of Officers and Non Commissioned Officers. Employment in the Red Cross Institutions.Outside employment with Dutch firms etc.ENCLOSURE.
With regard to Education, the moat Important factor is perhaps courses of study at the Dutch Universities; in order, to derive full profit from these courses the majority of students are first of all learning the &apos; rudiments of the Dutch language,    After the summer vacations a large number of officers will Join the Universities which have boen opened most generously to the British by the Dutch Authorities free of charge.    To meet the requirements of a less ambitious standard the Red Cross have instituted a large variety of classes on various subjects which are attended by some 500 pupils; these numbers are increasing daily *    The Royal Society of Arts has kindly agreed to hold Examinations for Won Commissioned Officers free of charge, also a considerablefproportion of the Officers propose to present themselves fbr the Examinations of the Society in Foreign languages.    There are two Army Schools in full swing which are largely attended.The employment In the Red Crass Institutions provides for some hundreds of men who are learning trades which will qualify them for civil life; preference is given to those Won Commissioned Officers or men who have reached or are approaching the conclusion of their Army Service.This work is most popular and the men are most zealous, recognising as they do, the Importance of qualifying themselves to be useful citizens in after life.anIt has been/agreeable surprise how many appointments have been found locally;   the Du^ch have naturally been obliged to protect their own interests and to frame regulations debarring the Interned from competing in the local Labour^Markets.   Nevertheless some hundreds of men are working in Holland at useful employments as civilian workers. - Perhaps our generous hosts havo not been very rigid in the5 adherence to their own regulations, but whatever the cause, the result-may be regarded as satisfactory *In addition to the activities in the neighbourhood of the Hague, preparations have been made at Leeuwarden for the employment, of large numbers aa soon as a Detachment of lpOO men moves there, as is contemplated for an ealy date.I think you will agree from this short description that, far from there being any grounds for pessimism, the success of the Red Cross work is assured; Honour to whom Honour is due, from very small beginnings an enormous organisation has grown up.   Mfc*Voules has obtained the services of a large and devoted Staff.    He has provided Huts, Class ROtims, Garages, Offices, Schools, and(Equipment from England.   The bulk of the Prisoners are usefully an^ profitably employed, while the work is increasing daily.    Thanks to your help and the ready support of Lord Sandwich and his Staff at Thurloe Place no interruption has occured in the progress until one memorable day a few weeks ago, the Military Authorities dropped a hint to the effect that if the Red Cross did not slacken their efforts somewhat, there would not be sufficient men available for routine duties.    This re-sult speaks for itself, and is doubly satisfactory when we recall thai the whole organisation had to be improvised, that the work lay in a foreign Country and there were no precedents or past experience to serve as a guide.I can only say in conclusion that if Miss Vulllamy was actually responsible for statements of the nature described to me, I am un-eble to trace her motive in making them and can only believe that, being so wrapped up in her own excellent work, she has lost sight of efforts made by others.Believe me,Yours Sincerely,.(Sd.)    J .S.FITZGERALD. CAPTAIN. THE ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT.To:-The Honourable Sir,Arthur Stanley,M.P.23, Pall Mall,
