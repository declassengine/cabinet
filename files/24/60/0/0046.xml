V [This Document is the Property^of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1918.SECRET.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 31st July, 1918.Part I: General Remarks.The situation as regards coal supplies is discussed.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press upon Russia, Ireland, the Munition strike, and other matters is described.Part III: District Reports.Various wages applications have been put forward. Trouble has arisen between the Mersey Trades&apos; Federation and the Mersey Reconstruction (Shop Stewards) Committee.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. The strike of riveters in Glasgow is at an end, and no strike of great importance is now in progress.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work. Various somewhat unimportant con-troversial cases are reported.Anxiety as to the position in regard to coal supplies is rapidly increasing, and the shortage has already begun to affect industrial working. In the potteries a definite crisis has occurred. A number of firms have had&apos; to close down for varying periods, amounting in some cases to as much as a fortnight, and many others are working short time. The deficiency is felt most keenly in Longton, where the cheaper grades of crockery are produced, and the firms, being chiefly small concerns, are unable to add large stocks. &apos; An agreement has now been arrived at by which the National Council of the pottery industry will distribute whatever supply is available. It is, however, alleged that the allotment is only a fraction of the reduced amount which had been promised. In Nottingham the lace manufacturers are complaining of the quality of coal supplied, and in Lancashire, where the shortage of cotton has already diminished employment, any failure in coal would produce disastrous results. Another industry which is seriously threatened is the manufacture of glass. While industries are being hampered in this manner, the domestic consumer is threatened with even greater difficuities and hardships during the coining winter. The detailed orders are not yet fully understood, and the necessary forms to be filled in by private individuals have not been completely circulated. It is doubtful whether the ration for small households is sufficient, but apart from this the price of coal, due mainly to the increase in wages paid to the miners, is such that at best many poorer households will be without sufficient fuel this winter. There are signs that public opinion is becoming acute on the coal question, and it may well prove as fertile a source of discontent as the food shortage of last winter.Summary.I. General Remarks.[1100-41]B
One matter to which attention will certainly be directed is the attitude of the miners. At the Miners&apos; Conference held last month, a clear intention was expressed of driving coal-owners out of the industry by demands for a reduction of the hours and days worked together with maintenance of the existing scale of wages. &quot;While these resolutions were directed to forcing Government to legislate for the reduction to take effect within four weeks of the declaration of peace, there are indications that the younger and less responsible men are already agitating for more hasty action. In the South Wales coalfield there is an Unofficial Reform Committee, which came into sharp conflict with the executive of the South Wales Miners&apos; Confederation and with Government during the Tredegar strike. After refusing for some time either to meet that committee, or to negotiate while men remained on strike in violation of an agree-ment to which they were a party, the Coal Controller yielded on both points, and directed the colliery manager to grant the disputed point before the men returned to work. The case has had the worst possible effect, not only on the rank and file, but also on the union executive. During the embargo strike it was quoted as an example to be followed. This committee has now issued a manifesto demanding a single organisation for the entire mining industry, immediate ownership and control of the means of production, reductions in. hours of work, and a payment of 11. a day with payment for six shifts for every five worked. In the case of mine-workers other than miners, demands, which the Coal Controller a few weeks ago described as quite foreign to the basis on which the war wage rests, are apparently to be granted A fresh example (in Cumberland) of the insubordination of men to their executives is given in Part IV of this report.The whole position is unsatisfactory to an unusual degree, and if allowed to drift can only lead to trouble of the most serious nature. Ever since they were excluded from the Munitions of War Act, the miners have felt that they have the whip-hand of the Government, and have used their position to force concession, after concession without encountering any effective opposition. The result has been a decreased and decreasing output per head, because many of the miners see no reason for working six shifts a week if they can earn enough in five. The rank and file probably do not realise the national results of absentism, but there can be little doubt that their leaders do, or that some among them are deliberately exploiting the situation with a view to the ultimate expropriation of the coal-owner. Each fresh concession has only made matters worse instead of better, and has encouraged the extremists to press new demands. Sooner or later the Government will have to take a stand as it did at Coventry, if the coal situation is to be really remedied.II. Press Comments.Russia.The National Council of the Independent Labour Party has published a mani-festo, which is reproduced by several Labour1 papers. It lays stress on the fact that the Allies have intervened in Russia without the consent of, and in direct opposition to the wishes of, the Soviet Government, which has maintained its authority and has been carrying out great schemes of social reorganisation for nine months. Com-menting on this, Mr. Snow den, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; says that the two expecli-tions to the North and to Siberia are equivalent to the invasion of a neutral country. The &quot; Herald &quot; describes the action of the Allies as&apos;dishonourable, and fatal to our profession of high motives. To supplement the meagre Russian news in the ordinary daily papers, the &quot;Herald &quot; and the &quot;Call &quot; publish articles praising the achieve-ments of the Bolsheviks.- Pacifism.There is rather less pacifist writing than usual in the Labour press, and the opposition papers are speaking up. &quot;Justice,&quot; referring to a translation of a book by Carl Liebkhecht on Militarism, affirms that a negotiated peace, even without indemnities and with the restoration of occupied country, would be a substantial German victory. M. Huysmans, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; sets out to explain the real posi-tion of the German Socialists with reference to Muller&apos;s letter in &quot; Vorwarts.&quot; The absence of any reference to negotiations between Scheidemann and Troelstra is
explained by the censors-hip. As regards Alsace-Lorraine, M. Huysmans maintains that all he ever suggested was that the German Majority consider that the question of Alsace is &quot;discussable.&quot; Mr. Brailsford, however, asserts that a new offer of peace was made to the French Government on behalf of Germany while the German offensive still prospered. A strong contrast is drawn between French policy and Mr. Wilson&apos;s. The French gave Mr. Wilson his choice either to consent to a peace at Russia&apos;s expense, or to allow Japanese intervention. Mr. Wilson&apos;s idealism has clashed with Western realism, and he has been heavily defeated.Ireland.The &quot; Herald&quot; sums up the Irish debate as leading nowhere, and explains this by saying that no debate in a discredited assembly can lead anywhere. Mr. Dillon&apos;s motion was negatived by the overwhelming vote of placemen and place-hunters. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; condemning the speeches of Mr. Bhortt and Mr. Bonar Law, says that generous treatment of the Irish problem m the early part of this year would doubtless have met with sympathetic response even from the most extreme sections of the Irish people. The omission -to introduce the Home Rule Bill is a triumph for Sir Edward Carson and his friends. The &quot;Call&quot; thinks no real solution can be found until the Irish labourer, like the English labourer, is freed from the levy which capitalism imposes upon every worker. Irish labour and British labour must settle the Irish question.India.Comments.on the scheme for Indian reforms appear in the &quot;Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot;Herald.&quot; The former suggests there are dissensions within the Govern-ment. Mr. Montagu&apos;s statement that no support is found in India for a wide measure of Home Rule is contested, as practically all educated Indians favour a scheme giving to the people of India control over purely Indian affairs. In the view of the &quot; Herald,&quot; the report fails in leaving all power to the Viceroy, who is responsible, not to the people of India, but to the British Government.Munitions Strike.Both &quot;Justice&quot; and the &quot;Clarion&quot; maintain their attitude of condemnation of the strikers. Mr. Hyndman, in a signed leader in &quot;Justice,&quot; takes the subject as a text for further preaching on the unreliability of the present Government, one of the worst offenders being the Minister of Munitions. The embargo was a breach of faith with highly-skilled men. He holds, however, that the men had not a vestige of right either to strike, or even to threaten to strike, and engineers who refused to take part are congratulated. A moral is pointed to workers who allow pacifist anarchists to egg them into conflict with their comrades in order to gain peace and satisfaction to the enemy. The &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; says frankly that the nation has agreed to military conscription, and the engineers are not acting fairly in. resisting a mild application to themselves. The &quot; Clarion &quot; takes a similar line, and quotes workers as saying that the men had been rushed into the strike against their own will and judgment by Bolshevik agitators, who have captured all the work-shop committees. No credit is given by other papers to the effect of the Proclmaa-tion in settling the strike. According to the &quot;Herald,&quot; the men were induced to return by the appeal to their patriotism, while the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks they were affected by the decision of the Trade Union Advisory Committee and the pro-mise of a Committee of Inquiry. Both these papers mention the Proclamation but condemn it strongly. It will constitute another grievance to be treasured up. The &quot;Herald &quot; says that the workers of this country must not grumble at being exploited unless they are prepared to revise their earlier decisions supporting the war, while neglecting to see it was properly conducted.Miners.A drastic manifesto issued by the Unofficial Reform Committee of the South Wales Miners calls for immediate consideration of a programme designed to destroy the capitalist system of exploitation. The Committee describes its own functions as stimulating the Executive Council when it loiters and as an educational force among the men.
Food.In his article on the Food Consumers&apos; Council, Mr. Hyndnian repeats his eulogy of the self-sacrifice shown by Americans. He continues to rail at Government for its neglect of home production, as a result of which the people will remain at the mercy of swindling shipowners. The Ministry of Food has been very slow in sanctioning the erection of cold storage in Ireland for cattle slaughtered there. He speaks of a complaint received from men employed on trawlers that their wages are insufficient, and that, owing to faulty, distribution or deliberate action, a good deal of their catch had been wasted.In the &quot;Co-operative News &quot; appears a claim for the appointment of women as Food Controllers, and it is asserted that in 1795 a conspicuous part was taken by women in organising the distribution of food.J11. I) i strict Reports .London and South Eastern.Reports from this district are now satisfactory, and the agitation which was prevalent last week has largely subsided, pending the result of the enquiry into the embargo question.Fresh trouble may arise over the shop steward, Rock, who has been dismissed from two firms since he left Waring and Gillow&apos;s, and the union are now taking up his case.A movement is on foot at the Arsenal to obtain the rescission of the 48 hours rule, under which men must work 48 hours before being paid time-and-a-half, while overtime worked on one day does not prevent the cutting of wages for lost time on another. London District Rules, on the contrary, make it compulsory to pay overtime rates for any overtime worked. The question is complicated by the threat of the management to discontinue a bonus paid to the men for every year of service upon their departure, if they insist upon the application of the London District Rules. This bonus has not been paid to any who joined since the Insurance Act came into force. The younger men, who are now in the majority, are anxious for a change in the rules, while the older men are unwilling to lose their bonus.West Midlands.Matters in this area are once more normal, and reports indicate that the strikers are working with redoubled energy in order to make up for lost time.A meeting of the Wolverhampton Joint Engineering Trades&apos; Committee on the 30th, advised their members to remain at work pending the result of the Committee of Inquiry. If the result is unsatisfactory, a conference of representatives of the Allied Trades&apos; Committees will be called. The executives will be moved if the decision is not announced within a month.An agitation against discharged soldier workers has arisen at the Austin Works, in which under-managers and foremen are taking part, in addition to the men.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The situation in this district is satisfactory, and the engineers who are taking their holiday are no longer agitating over the question of embargoes. The general opinion seems to have been, strongly against any drastic action upon this question, and general relief is manifest that the crisis has been averted.At a meeting of the Nottingham branch of the Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors on the 28th, a denouncement of the strikers was received with much enthusiasm.An agitation has recently arisen among tramway workers to secure wages for the women equivalent to those of the men, and much dissatisfaction is expressed with a recent award of the Committee on Production which refused an increase to women while granting it to men. The principle was not disputed, but the Committee found that the contention that the work of the women was equal to that of men was not established.  For the moment no action is threatened, but the women are. showing
a determined attitude. A demand for an advance in wages is also being-put forward by Leeds branches of the National Union of Railwaymen, in view of the high, prices of all commodities.North- Western.Considerable disturbance is manifest throughout this district.The friction between the Mersey Trades&apos; Federation and the Mersey Recon-struction Committee is apparently becoming serious, and a meeting of about 200 delegates from the two bodies was held on the 30th to discuss the question. The shop stewards now intend to call a mass meeting in order to ascertain by which body the men decide to be governed, as they believe that a committee to draw up a working policy between the two bodies is not a possible solution of the difficulty. Much annoyance was expressed at this meeting by the shop stewards at the action of the A.S.E. District Secretary in cancelling the ballot on the question of a strike upon the embargo question on his own initiative. A short report was also given by the delegate to the Leeds Conference, who stated that the Birmingham and Coventry men had ruined the whole movement by going out on strike and coming in without reference to other districts, since they had thus destroyed the possibility of joint action.The Mersey shipwrights have expressed much dissatisfaction with the trade union officials, whom they considered to be too autocratic, and tney have, in con-sequence, agreed to nominate two men from each section as members of the Reconstruction Committee.At Liverpool and Manchester a strong movement has started against the employ-ment of conscientious objectors, which has, in one case, resulted in a strike, and the skilled&apos; men seem to be determined to teach them nothing, though they have withdrawn this threat as regards other unskilled labour.Northern.Satisfactory conditions prevail in this area, and very little unrest is reported.Discontent is, however, felt with the recent award of the Committee on Produe-tion to time-workers at Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworths&apos;, Walker-on-Tyne. The shop stewards got up a meeting of protest among the workers, and are now com-municating with shop stewards in other yards, in order to obtain their views upon the question. Employees of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, Pelaw-on-Tyne, are on strike over the question whether workers should join the Co-operative Employees&apos; Union or should be allowed to join a union of their craft.South Wales.Some discontent is manifest in this district, but it is not very serious.The railway shopmen are agitating for an advance of 1/. a week, together with double time on Sunday and a week&apos;s holiday with pay. This demand is now to be referred to the Committee on Production,The men engaged in the engineering trades at Cardiff are also demanding an increase of from Is. 2td. to Is. Qd. an hour, and a reduction in hours of work. An opinion in favour of striking is expressed by many of&apos; the men if these demands are refused, while they complain that much delay always occurs in considering their claims.Scotland.Xhe situation in this area is in general quiet and satisfactory, and there seems to be no likelihood of any trouble upon the question of embargoes. The skilled men in Glasgow do not, in fact, seem to object to being shifted from one firm to another, provided they can find lodgings near by.At the last meeting of the C.W.C., a report of his visit to Coventry was given by Gallacher. He stated that he had experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining any information as to the strike from the A.S.E. headquarters officials, who received him coldly upon learning that he came from the C.W.C., while the shop steward,[1100-41]C
Dingley, gave him few details, as lie said the strike was official, and he was not con-cerned in it. The meeting was apparently discouraged by his report, and it was decided to take no further action in the matter.No details have been received of the demonstration arranged for the 4-th August by the Clyde Defence Propaganda Committee.IV.-Disputes. (a.) Involving a Stoppage of Wvrk.tThe general situation seems to be satisfactory, and the strikes reported are few in number and unimportant.The Admiralty Labour Department has hardly any new strikes to report.A meeting of the riveters on strike at Messrs. Barclay, Curie and A. Stephen and Sons, Govan, was held on the 1st, at which it was decided to resume work on condition that an award was issued within 14 days. Work was accordingly resumed on the 2nd.A short strike occurred at the Deptford Dry Dock Co., owing to the dismissal of a man who is a conscientious objector. Only ten electricians were, however, involved, and the dispute has now been settled.No settlement has been made of the ironmoulders&apos; dispute at Sheffield.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 35,705 workpeople involved in strikes for the week ending the 31st July.The blast-furnacemen at the Workington Iron and Steel Co. resumed work on the understanding that their grievance should be referred to London, and an answer given within three weeks.On the 26th July, 226 clerks at the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron, and Coal Company struck as an attempt to coerce other clerks into joining the union. The company object to pressure being put on clerks whom they regard as efficient and trustworthy, and have stated that there is no need for the Ministry of Munitions to interfere as output is not affected.An application for an increase of wages by the Dockers&apos; Union for members employed at the Levant Mine, St. Just, has resulted in a strike of 280 men. An offer which was made by the management was rejected, but the union have agreed that the pump men shall remain at work.A strike of about 30 aircraft workers has occurred at the Austin Motor Works, in consequence of the employment of a boy on a machine said to be men&apos;s work, but negotiations are now proceeding.The Coal Controller has five new strikes to report, involving 19,100 men; in four of these cases work has now been resumed.The Cumberland enginemen struck at the Ladysmith Pit, Whitehaven, on the 29th July, in consequence of a dispute as to the reduction of a loco driver for careless-ness, while other pits subsequently joined in sympathy. This action was taken by the Enginemen&apos;s Association, which refused to allow the dispute to go before the joint committee, and repudiated the agreement under which the committee was set up. The strike began without consultation with the leaders of the national federa-tion, who were opposed to such a course. Work was resumed on the 1st August, and the dispute will now go before a joint committee.The stoppage at the Risca Colliery, which still continues, is being dealt with by the Home Office.The War Office Contracts Department has no strikes or controversial cases to report this week.A strike of about 2,000 men and 1,000 women has occurred in the tailoring trade in London, owing to a demand for the payment of a weekly wage instead of piece-work in the ladies&apos; tailoring trade. The Jewish National Labour Council arranged a mass meeting at Whitechapel on the 1st August in support of the strike, at which about 3,000 were present.About 1,500 employees of Messrs. John Bibby and Sons, Liverpool, ceased work as a protest against the&quot;employment of conscientious objectors. They had apparently given notice 3 weeks ago of their intention to strike unless the men were removed, but nothing was done. They seem to be determined not to resume work until their grievance is remedied.
o(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.No controversial cases of any importance are reported by the Admiralty Labour Department.The Ministry of Munitions reports that at the Liverpool National Filling Factory, notices to strike were filed in connection with a claim by the National Amalgamated Union of Labour for a 47-hour week, and night shift rates. The matter has since, however, been referred to arbitration.The bricklayers at His Majesty&apos;s Factory, Sutton Oak, and several other estab-lishments, have threatened to strike on the 8th August unless the district rate of Is. Qd. per hour is conceded.The Coal Controller has no new controversial cases to report. One old case is noted as settled.The Scottish Undermanagers Association is demanding an advance of 20s. a week owing to increased cost of living, and exceptional responsibility due to the war. These officials have recently received an advance of 28s. M. a week.No report has been received this week from the Committee on Production.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 140 differences for the week ending the 3rd August, fourteen of which are claims for the 12^ per oent. bonus.Arbitration has been arranged with regard to the claim of the taxi-cab drivers, and work has therefore been resumed.G. H. ROBERTS.
