July 25, Mr. Clynes presided at a dinner given by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the Carlton Hotel to the Food Controllers of the United States of America, France, and Italy. The Prime Minister proposed the health of the guests, and emphasised the continued necessity for economy.The constitution and functions of the Inter-Allied Food Council are set forth in the following agreement: -1. The Food Controllers of Great Britain, France, Italy, and the United States having met together to examine their respective requirements of food in relation to the supplies available, are of opinion that the time has now arrived when further steps should be taken to co-ordinate the food programme of each of the Allied countries in the light of: (a) Their import necessities ;(b) Tonnage available ;(c) Finance ; and(d) Elimination of competition in purchase and transport.&apos;2. The aim of such co-ordination should be to preserve a proper balance between the needs of the Allied countries, not only in respect of single oom-modities or groups of commodities as has hitherto been the case, but in regard to their food supplies as a whole, and to secure the purchase and transport of overseas supplies.3. They have therefore agreed, subject to the approval of their respective Governments, upon the formation of an Inter-Allied Food Council which shall be composed of the Food Controllers of the four Allied countries above-mentioned, which shall meet every three months, or as often as may be necessary, and shall, within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the respective Governments, agree upon a programme and method of food imports embracing the needs of all the Allied countries and determine questions of common interest and policy.4. They have further agreed that the four Food Controllers should appoint two representatives each to form a body called the Inter-Allied Food Council Committee of Representatives,&quot; having its headquarters in London.The Committee of Representatives shall, with the approval of the Food Council, elect an independent chairman, from outside their own number, who shall have no vote.The Allied Maritime Transport Council, the Inter-Allied Finance Council, and the Inter-Allied Scientific Commission will each be asked to appoint a delegate to assist the Committee of Representatives. When the Committee of Representatives linds that the interests of other countries are involved they may invite representatives of these countries to attend.5. The functions of the Committee of Representatives shall be, subject to the direction of their Food Controllers, to secure and to co-ordinate the pro-grammes of the various food executives (specified below) dealing with particular classes of food-stuffs, and to consolidate these programmes into a general food programme for all foods and all Allied countries ; to act as the sole channel of communication as to general policy between these executives and the Allied Maritime Transport -Council and the Inter-Allied Finance Council, to adjust the food programme from time to time according to circumstances ; to supervise and ensure the purchase and shipping programme and to generally carry on the work of the Council in accordance with the powers delegated to it by the respective Food Controllers.a  (33)6275-1   Pkl   135  8/18  E&amp;S k
6. The following committees or executives are set up or continued : -A. Wheat Executive.B. Meat and Fats Executive.C. Sugar Programme Committee.D. Oil-Seed Programme Committee ;and such other committees as may become necessary from time to time.These executives and committees shall from time to time formulate programmes for the equitable provision and distribution of imports among the different countries and shall co-operate in directing the execution of such programmes, subject to the policy set out by the Food Controllers through the Committee of Representatives. These executives and committees are to be constituted of equal numbers of representatives from England, France, Italy, and the United States.The following resolutions were passed at the Conference of Allied Food Controllers at their meeting on July 26 : 1; The Food Council hereby confirms the principle which was accepted by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, in November last, that the minimum requirements of food must have priority in the general allocation of tonnage.2. The question of railway trucks and other facilities is of primary importance for securing the proper home distri but ion of supplies.The quantity of railway material now taken up for militarv purposes in each of the Allied countries is so great and is so constantly on the increase, that the number of locomotives and trucks left for the carriage of civilian supplies has gradually sunk to such a dangerous level that economic life is actually threatened with paralysis in some quarters. This would be bound, in the long run, to paralyse military operations.The Food Council therefore calls the attention of the Allied Governments to the necessity of: (1) Facilitating the construction of railway material in all Allied countries by allocating a greater number of men and a larger quantity of material for this purpose.(2) Allocating tonnage for the immediate transport of trucks and locomotives in all countries where they are urgently needed.(3) The adequate provision of finance for the purpose.3. Resolved that while the increased production of the United States renders it possible to relax some of the restrictions which have borne with peculiar hardship upon all our peoples, yet it is absolutely necessary that rigid economy and eliminatioti of waste in the consumption and handling of all food-stuffs, as well as increased production, should be maintained throughout the European Allied countries, and in North America.It is only by such economy and elimination of waste that the transportation of the necessary men and supplies from North America to the European front can be accomplished, and that stocks of foodstuffs can be built up in North America as an insurance against the ever-present danger of harvest failure and the possible necessity for large emergency drafts to Europe.We cannot administer the food problem on the basis of one year&apos;s war ; we must prepare for its long continuance if we are to ensure absolute victory.The following resolutions were passed at the Conference of Allied Food Controllers at their meeting on July 29 : .1. Resolved that Sir John Beale be requested to take the office of independent Chairman of the Committee of Representatives to serve at the pleasure of the Inter-Allied Food Council, it being understood that Sir John Beale will resign as British Representative upon the Wheat Executive.2. ^Resolved that the Committee of Representatives be instructed to at once engage office quarters and the shipping, secretarial, and statistical assistance necessary for the execution of the primary memorandum, it being agreed that the four Governments shall each undertake to pay one-quarter of the expense &apos;        involved pending any further arrangement.3. Resolved that the Committee of Representatives should formulate, not less than once monthly, a statistical statement showing as nearly as may be the
stocks of the principal food commodities in England, France, Italy, and the United States, together with the arrivals of food-stuffs, with a monthly com-parison of these arrivals with the programmes that may be agreed upon. This information to be for circulation to the various Food Controllers and such other agencies as may be indicated confidentially.4-. Resolved, that the present intention of the resolution providing for a uniform bread thoughout the four countries on the basis of 80 per cent; wheat products and 20 per cent, other cereals is that the bread should actually be diluted to the extent of 20 per cent.&quot; with such cereals or in part an increased percentage of milling. The bread dilution to be irrespective of other cereals in the diet.5. Resolved that the Committee of Representatives should engage Sir Guy Gfanet to proceed to the United States to take charge and re-organise the purchase of North American food commodities on behalf of the European Allies, such re-organisation to be carried out in co-operation with the United States Food Administration, the Canadian food authorities, and the High Commissioners of the various Allied Governments.The Committee of Representatives, with Sir John Beale in the chair, held their first meeting at Lancaster House on July 30. Mr. F. L. Turner, C.B., was appointed Secretary to the Committee.Amongst other matters, they considered a letter from the Allied Maritime Transport Council, suggesting that food programmes should be framed on the basis of last year&apos;s imports, less increase of production, regard being had to the Maritime Goimcil&apos;s estimate that every additional 5,000 tons would involve the sending of 1,000 fewer American soldiers to France.The Committee reported progress to the Allied Food Council the same day, and the following resolutions were passed by the Council :-1. In the opinion of the Food Council the development of the various commodity import programmes by the Committee of Representatives should be based upon the following priorities : (1) Bread grains, Civilian and Army. (2) Army Supplies (Meat, Fodder, &amp;c). (3 j Civilian Meats and Fats. (4) Feeds for Dairy Cattle. (5) Civilian Cereal Diet outside Bread.The relative position of the following groups is left for further dis-cussion: Feeds for Draught Animals.Civilian Comestibles (Sugar, Coffee, Tea, Dried Fruits). Industrial uses of Grain. Feeds for Meat Animals.2. The letter of the Allied Maritime Transport Council having been laid before the Food Council, the Council washes to state that while it agrees with the absolute necessity of minimum use of tonnage and has in itself been created for this purpose, yet the basis of calculation on imports to England, France, and Italy upon the foundation of last year&apos;s imports, less increase of production, simply means a repetition of the food difficulties of last year. We wish to state emphatically that the morale of the people will be most seriously endangered by such a basis of imports. &quot; The Food Council puts forward as a more constructive basis the employment of the same ship ton mileage during the coming year.3. In the matter of bread-grains it is considered imperative that such supplies shall be provided as will permit of bread distribution without rationing. It is considered, however, fundamentally necessary to maintain actual dilution in the bread to the extent that, based on 80 per cent, milling of wheat, 20 per cent, of other cereal diluents should be added to the bread. If the milling ratio in any given country should exceed 80 per cent., then the proportion of diluents may be reduced accordingly.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.(1) The Milk Products (Imports Restriction) Order, 1918, dated 20th July, 1918, provides that after August 1st no one shall, except under licence, buy, sell or deal in
condensed milk (other than canned condensed milk), dried milk, or sugar of milk, for shipment to the United Kingdom. The Order does not apply to any of the above articles which are on passage to the United Kingdom on August 1st.(2) The Jam (Prices) No. 2 Order, .1918, dated 26th July, 1918, amends, as from July 29, the wholesale and retail maximum.prices for jam, made from soft fruits.(3) The Plums (Sales) Order, 1918, dated 27th July, 1918, prohibits, except under licence, the importation of plums or greengages. The Order lays down maximum prices for certain varieties of plums, and these plums may be sold only to a jam manufacturer or to a recognised dealer, who undertakes to sell to a jam manufacturer. The restriction does not apply to growers of less than 1 cwt.Organised Distribution.Rationing. Bacon and ham have been released from the coupon as from Sunday, 28th July, and as from the same date butcher&apos;s meat may be purchased on all four coupons of a meat leaf. The coupon value of meat purchaseable has, however, been reduced from seven-pennyworth to live-pennyworth, making the total amount of butcher&apos;s meat purchasable in one coupon period, 20d. worth as against 21d. worth.The principal alterations resulting from, this change are ; (1) The supplementary ration books are withdrawn.(2) The pig will be ration free to self-suppliers, i.e., the restriction as to thefirst pig will be abolished. (3) Persons in receipt of direct supplies will have to account for only suchpart of the pig as is classed as pork. (4) Whilst bacon and ham have been made ration free, customers will still beconfined to their registered retailers ; but such retailers are instructedto supply, on demand, not less than 8 ozs. of bacon or 12 ozs of hamper head per week to their registered customers.Self-Suppliers. Under the revised regulations for self-suppliers, owners of 50 head or less of poultry will not be required to keep records of consumption. Persons owning fowls will be entitled to consume free of the ration one bird per week for every four people or less in the household. In accounting for the home consumption of rationed food-stuffs, the self-suppliers are not confined to the coupons numbered to correspond with the week in which the food has to be accounted for, but may use either previous or subsequent coupons in addition to the current ones. The head of the household will be responsible for detaching the correct number of coupons corresponding to the amount of meat consumed and for preserving them for production to the Food Control Committee when required.Direct Supplies. Direct supply permits and certificates to the producer to the effect that the consumer will refrain from buying rationed food-stuffs to the extent of his direct supplies are no longer required.Shootings. The person owning or taking the shooting is responsible for detaching and keeping the appropriate coupons for game killed on his shooting and consumed in his own household. As regards such game given or sold by the producers to persons outside his own household, the head of the household to which such game is sent is responsible for accounting for the consumption ; similarly, employees living outside households who are entitled to rank as self-suppliers and who receive game from the employer are themselves responsible for detaching the coupons.Coupon Rates. The rate for butter remains at 8 ozs. for self-suppliers. The rates for poultry, venison, wild fowl, and feathered game, have been revised, and are on a more liberal scale for self-suppliers and direct supplies.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions for the week is 826, with 770 convictions ; 205 of which were in Ireland, with 181 convictions.The percentage of convictions is high in all the divisions, the South Midland being the lowest with 88 per cent.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.The weekly tables indicate that the imports of important foods are following the anticipated lines. The stocks of sugar are being placed on a safer level, having regard to the decrease in importation expected during the winter, bacon is arriving in large quantities and rice imports also are heavy. On the other hand the import of wheat and other cereals contrasts badly with that of last year ; but there is no ground for anticipating that the 13 weeks reserve will not be secured. While this is lower than that of last September, the prospects of the home harvest are improving and it is probable that we shall start the winter with a somewhat larger stock than last year, when it reached the amount required for 26 weeks&apos; consumption.imports.Table A has been rendered more comprehensive by the inclusion of certain items hitherto omitted. Condensed milk, coffee, cocoa, and edible oils appear for the first time ; for the last named only monthly figures are available.The week ending July 27th saw a substantial improvement in the receipt of wheat and flour. In equivalent grain the increase on the week before was from 59,900 tons to 84,100 tons, that is 24,200 tons. Rice also was higher, but barley, oats, and maize all recorded heavy decreases with the result that the &quot; other cereals &quot; taken together totalled only 29,100 tons, 21,600 tons less than in the previous week.Beef, mutton and meat unenumerated were lower, but an increase in bacon and hams to 21,400 tons brought up the total for all meat to a figure 800 tons higher than that for the previous week. It is unlikely that the freeing of bacon from coupon restrictions will have any marked immediate effect on total consumption, and in view of the warmer weather the quantity received may be taken as equal to about two weeks&apos; requirements.With the exception of Christmas week of last year when the quantity received was but half a ton greater, in no week since the outbreak of war has the importation of butter been so small. In the last three weeks receipts of butter have in the aggre-gate been only 500 tons. The import of lard, 5,700 tons, is the heaviest for any week during the past 15 months ; for the first time this year, total arrivals have risen above the total for the corresponding period of 1917.Receipts of sugar at 40,900 tons were the largest since the week ended April 20th. Unusually heavy consignments of condensed milk arrived; the total was 5,200 tons against 2,200 tons in the previous week and 740 tons, the pre-war average. A large took is important having regard to the possible shortage in the milk supply during the winter.The striking falling off this year in imports of coffee and cocoa is shown by the fact that, although total arrivals of tea in the first thirty weeks of 1918 are 57,900 tons greater than in the corresponding period of 1917, the aggregate for the three beverages is 3,600 tons lower. Of coffee only 2,800 tons has been received against 25,100 tons; of cocoa only 10,900 tons against 50,000 tons. An increase in cocoa imports is particularly desirable.The following table shows weekly arrivals of condensed milk, coffee, and cocoa during the first six months of the year and during the past four weeks, together with a comparison with last year : 	condensed Milk.		coffee.		cocoa.		1918.	1917.	1918.	1917.	1918.	1917. 1	tous.	tons.	tons.	tons.	tons.

Consumption,Meat. The table showing the supplies of dead meat at four wholesale markets has been discontinued. The purpose it served was mainly to provide a comparison with earlier years. Owing to the central control and distribution of supplies and the artificial delimitation of the areas fed by particular markets, the table has ceased to provide a reliable index.The quantity of imported meat put into consumption weekly has steadily declined since the week ending June 15th when the total was 8,620 tons ; for the week ending July 20th the total was only 5,530 tons.The beneficial effect of the recent rain in improving the condition, of the grass and so checking the rush of animals to market has become apparent. As compared with the previous week the number of fat cattle stalled in Great Britain during the week ended July 20th fell 4 per cent, and the number of sheep 9 per cent; (Table C).Bread and Mow.--The returns of consumption and sales by bakers and retailers of flour for the four weeks ended July 20th show a fall of 2 per cent, on the previous four weeks (Table E). In 1917 the consumption decreased 4 per cent, from June to July, and in July was 5 per cent, lower than this year.A slight decrease is observed in most parts of the United Kingdom. The local variations are to be attributed to movements during the holiday season, and are; in almost every case in the same direction as a year ago (Table J).Bakers and retailers stocks have increased slightly. Changes since the beginning of the year are given below.   Since March stocks have been remarkably steady :  	Number of Weeks&apos; Consumption held in Stock.								20.7.18.	22.fl.18.	-25.5.18.	27.4.18.	30.3.18.	2.3.18.	2.2.18.	5.1.18.Yorks., Lanes., and North	1-5	1-5	1-6	1-6	1-6	1-8	1-8	1-6of England.	1-7							Rest of England and Wales -		1-6	1-6	1-7	1-8	2-0	1-9	2-1Scotland   -	28	2-4	2-5	2-3	2-5	3-0	2-8	3-5Ireland     -      -      -      -	1-8	1-6	1-5	.1-5	1-7	1-9	1-6	1-6&quot;i	1-8	1-7	1-7	1-7	1-8	2-1	1-9	2-1Consumption of flour by biscuit manufacturers shows a fall of 8 per cent, on the previous four weeks and of 11 per cent, on the corresponding period of 1917 : Biscuit Makers&apos; Return.Consumption.

For the sixth week in succession supplies of fish at Billingsgate Market showed an increase on those of the week before. With an increase in the aggregate from 2,610 tons to 2,908 tons, the deficiency on last year fell from 26 per cent, in the week ending July 20th to 18 per cent, in the week ending July 27th.Stocks.The stock of cheese on July 20th was the highest since the outbreak of war ; a large proportion is held on Army account. Despite lower importations into the United Kingdom, the stock of butter has risen from 23,500 tons to 25,700 tons. Beef has fallen to 29,700 tons. iEstimates of the number of live stock in Great Britain on July 4th, as revised by the Live Stock Committee of the Board of Agriculture are given in Table G. Although figures are apt to be misleading unless the age and condition of the animals are borne in mind, the situation is satisfactory.. Cattle and pigs both show increases on the previous month, and the decline in sheep is purely seasonal.
