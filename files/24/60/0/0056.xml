Consumption of Motor PueJL,.With regard to the need of economy in the use of petrol, the Board hare drawn the attention of District Agri-:cultural Executive Committees to revised recommendation issued by the Petroleum Executive relating to the consumption of Motor Fuel.It has been found in practice that certain types of Agricultural tractors which were designed to run on petrol do not run economically, even with alterations, when they use paraffin, with the result that the actual quantity of fuel which has to be imported is increased and the efficiency of the machines is dimlnishsd.    It has been decided, therefore, to amend the previous recommendation that petrol should not be used where paraffin can be substituted for privately-owned tractors.In these circumstances the Board have advised that in future Agricultural Executive Committees should recommend the granting of petrol for food produo bion purposes wherever they are satisfied that it is more suitable to the machine, than paraffin and that if there is any doubt as to whether paraffin or petrol should be used, preference should be given to petrol.5.,.
