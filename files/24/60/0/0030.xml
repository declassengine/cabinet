CHitS.....POCtKiTOT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT,)SECRET, &apos;:.T.-533o.118LONDON   UNIVERSITY, (Note &quot;by Mr, Austen Chamberlain,)I have read wi.th interest and sympathy Mr. Fisher&apos;s kern or an dura circulated as G.I.5281.     I have no desire to criticise his proposals, but 1 think it is necessary to draw the attention of the Board of Education and the home Affairs Committee to the great disproportion between the assistance proposed to be rendered to the University of London and that hitherto accorded to other English Universities,The estimates show for the current year a grant of  8, COO to the University of London,  4,000 to the University of &quot;&quot;ales and  2,000 only to each of the other English Univexv sities.     There is in addition a total grant of  150,000 for colleges in Great Britain, but the estimates do not show how this sum is distributed.It is now proposed by Mr. Fisher to make an annual contribution of  160,000 to the University of London and a special contribution of  250,000 for central university buildings. I believe that I am right in saying that no &quot;building grant has ever been given to any other English University or University College.London, as the Capital of the Empire, no doubt affords special facilities to, and has special attractions- for students, and it is right that the University of London should take rani with the Universities established in other great Capitals,   But London is also the richest city in the world and the one in the best position to provide by voluntary means or by local rates for its ovm needs.   As I have said, I do not desire to oppose the further grants now suggested for that University, but I submit that if such a scheme as I,:r. Fisher proposes is to be adopted by the Government they must sim-ultaneously reconsider the niggardly support which they at present accord to other Universities and treat them with a corresponding generosity.     It cannot be expected that the members representing the great provincial University cities should be content to vote  160,000 a year to London while their own Universities receive only  2,000, or to provide a building grant for London of a quarter of a million whilst * such grants are absolutely refused to the cities which they represent,(lntd*)     A.
