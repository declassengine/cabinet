SUMMARY OP ENEMY ACTIVITY FOR THE PERIOD ENDING 29TH JULY, 1918.1.E S T E R M    FRONT:(a) Movements and Accommodation*    Since the 15th July the following fresh&quot;lov3ments ancTalterations in accommodation on the Battle Fronts have appeared.BATTLE FRONT.MOVEMENTSCHANGES IN ACCOMMODATIONLYS.SOMME.ReconniPursuit.J Protect[Bombin^lTotal*9-18-6CHAMPAGNE.*9-364-6I Sector.Flanders-56.364-72-51-36miLilleLensSheds .j E angars -6 !   -114-7-1St.Quentin +1Laon-12- 5-169In viev; of the events taking place in the Soissons Rheims Battle it is natural that the increase of machines should appear in this battle area-The chief point of interest is the movement of Bombing Squadrons,     Three Squadrons have left the British Front3 two of -whxch have gone x,o the Champagne, and the third to Lcimaiuo. the latter presumably in order to operate against the Independent Force.The weather during the last week has not been favourable,, and consequently comparatively few identifications of fresh movements have been established.Ono reconnaissance flight has moved from Salonika to Lorraine.(b) Aerodrome Accommodation (see Table).    It is interesting :Jo&apos;*no*,e&quot; that &quot;ihvliiite Sector has shown a Decrej\sj3 of 2^.&amp;^eds during the 1st week and an ^^reas^e oF^rourinff the 2nd week, also that the St.Quentm &quot;shows a P,e.PrQa3e   &apos;in the accommodation in Hangars by 167*The other Sectors have remained normal.

OTHER    FRONTS.(a)   ITALY.New units from other theatres of War have appeared on the Italian Front as follows:-3 Pursuit Companies from Galicia, Bukowina, Volhyniarespectively. 1 New Pursuit Company not previously identified. 1 Bombing Squadron not previously identified.This makes a total increase of 64 Pursuit machines.10 Bombing machines.TOTAL      74 Machinesall of which have appeared on the Venetian Sector with the exception of the Pursuit Company from Galicia, whioh is located in the Trentino Sector.Now that the 103rd Bombing Squadren is definitely located, it is probable that the remaining four Squadrons are in operation owing to the fact they are numbered in a series of 101 upv/ards but owing to the numerous conflicting reports it was thought that the Bombing Squadrons had been definitely disbanded. This would give the Austrian Air Service a total of 60 Bombing Machines if at full establishment.- 2 -(e) Distribution of German Bombing Forces on the Western Front   (Twin-engine and Giant Machines).
Aircraft Reconnaissance activity continues particularly over the mine fields in the Dardanelles.(f)   CAUCASUS.Detachments of the 28th German Reconnaissance Plight are reported to be still arriving at Batum en route for Tiflis.The arrival of the three Pursuit Companies from Russia is a strong indication of the great losses reported to have been inflicted on the Air Service during the recent offensive, especially among the fighters.It is reported that German Machines are once again on this front, but so far no machines have as yet been seen in the air.     The presence of the German 25th Pursuit Plight from Macedonia is reported.(b) PALESTINE.&apos; One Reconnaissance Flight has been moved from this Front to the Western Front (Lorraine).The continued growth of Rayak Aerodrome is persistently reported.    It would appear as if this aerodrome is being used as a big assembly and Repair Park.   Normal reinforcements are reported to be arriving.(c) SALONIKA.A reinforcement of 12* reconnaissance machines from Italy has arrived.(d) MESOPOTAMIA.No change, (e) AEGEAN.

TECH2-TIUAL   DEPARTMENT.shouts.Tests of Mark I Dragonfly have continued.    It is expected that some of the Mark II (production) engines will be ready soon after the end of August.   The Dragonfly engine whioh is to go to America in the &quot;Snipe&quot; has broken down under test, so that its despatch will be further delayed.ASROPLAHSS,The seoond V. type Handley Page machine should be flying this week.    The 4-engined Bristol should be flying to-morrow.Further trouble has been experienced with the construction of the reinforced engine mounting for the Bristol Arab.   Tests are not yet complete.It was found on full investigation that the installation of the B.H.P. engine in D.E.10 would entail large structural alterations.   For this and other reasons this combination has been -dropped.   The installation of the B.H.P. engine in Bristol Fighter will be pushed forward, taking priority of the 300 Hispano in this machine. Drawings of the llartinsyde Scout are being completed for issue to other firms in view of the decision to place this machine on the programme.exkpjk2ital.A successful long distance navigation flight on a Flying Boat (F.3-) has oeen made from Isle of Grain to the Soillies via Brest.   The &quot;course   setting bombsight&quot; was used as a navigation instrument.    The results are very promising. Further long distance aeroplane flights have been made from Orfordness, and all accurate navigation v/ork is being pressed forward.   Sites have been settled for the special Meteorological Stations on the British Isles,Special bomb dropping experiments from 15,000 ft. are being carried out at Stonehenge under Orfordness direction for G.O.C., R.A.F. in the Field.
