The weather for the first part of the week waB very bad, but has now improved, and it is hoped to have all the hay stacked by the end of the week, with the exception of some bank sides which will be oarted as cut.    The pea harvest will probably be commenced very shortly, but tho straw crops will not be ready for another fortnight.    Tho crops, produce and stock disposed of during the week included 1 cwt. palm nut meal, 1 owt.bran, 80 stones oats, 5 doz. ohlcks and 1,220 eggs.Holeeach*      The horses are still busy spraying amongst the potatoes and carting for the builder.    The settlors have been busy flax pulling.    The crop is a good one, and if the weather keeps fine tho pulling will be completed in a day or two.    The late heavy stormB have laid the crops badly.Heath Hill,.  -  During the four fine days of the week the hay harvest was oomploted, and some 60 aores were carted.    Of the total amount carted during the hay harvest - 200 aores were secured in splendid condition, 55 acres were secured in fair average condition! 5 acres only being spoilt.    Good progress has been made with thatching the staoks.    All the potatoes have now been topped dressed, moulded up and sprayed once.    Tho &quot;Army Baler&quot; visited the Colony during the week and &quot;pressed up&quot; the wheat and oat straw sold to them some two months ago.Tithe. Commons,, Copyhold and Survey BrandyAlthough the new Tithe Bill holds out to landowners a prospect of their being able to redeem the tithe rentcharge charged on their properties on more favourable terms than those ruling at present, no less than nine new applications for redemption have been received during the past week.    Progress has been made with many of the Redemptions, Altered Apportionments and Mergers of Tithe Rentcharge and Bnfranchisemente of Copyholds already in hand, and sixteen of these transactions, including seven Enfranchisements, have boen brought to completion.     During the past Boven months tithe rentcharge amounting to  2,838 has been extinguished by redemption or merger, as compared with 52,980 during the seven months preceding the outbreak of war and only  723 during the N corresponding seven months last year. \flax Production Branoh.Adverse leather has continued to hamper the harvesting operations.    Some 4,000 aores have now been pulled and a few hundred acres carted.    The rate of pulling, apart from the weather, has been below the estimate for all forms of labour except prisoners, and some reinforcement of labour has become necessary. 800 soldicre and some additional prisoners have been asked for.   The reason of this extra demand is primarily the prolonged wet weather, but other contributory causes are tho fact that the crops are generally heavy and very frequently &quot;laid&quot;, a certain amount of Influenza at many camps, especially schoolboy camps, and the incluBion of very young and undesirable boys amongst the oo-oalled &quot;city workers&quot;.    Many of the latter have been discharged and roplaccd where possible by Cadets and such other .. -forms of more responsible labour as are obtainable and extra supervision provided.

The building and equipment of the factories proceed fairly satisfactorily, and muoh of the deseeding machinery has already bejen delivered.gtftiftm. Purvey,.,During the week ending 7th August 1918, 55,746 maps were sent Overseas, 9,908 to the Air Ministry, 19,516 to the Admiralty, 3,924 to the War Offioe and 879 to Other Services.The outbreaks of Swine Fever numbered 28 though the number of suspected cases was 274 which suggests that the decrease in the number of outbreaks is not due to slackness in reporting.    -3f Anthrax there were only four outbreaks, Sheep-Scab 1 and Glanders 1. The outbreaks ef Parasitic Mange in horses numbered 58 which compared with earlier roturns shows a considerable reduction.The work of the Branch during the week has oonsisted principally ef enquiries and correspondence as to the improvement of rural transport and extended commercial control after the war and as to the sale of inferior feeding stuffs for swine and on matters arising in connection with the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act and the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.    The Branch has also been engaged on work in oonneotion with the Advisory Committee on Disposal of War Stores for Agricultural Purposes.M?IlP^t4on,s,,Bra^ffJa&apos;The number of applications for ordinary issues of tfoe Leaflets was 1.196, in response to which 3,485 oopies of Leaflets were despatched.    In addition 16,500 copies of Leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.

Further information was given to the Italian Delegation with regard to fishing operations in this Country and methods of fish preservation.    The Board have made an Order regulating the use of seine nets or trawl nets in oertain areas.n of the North Eastern Bea Fisheries District.    Arrangements are being made which it is hoped will have the effect of enabling two Icelandic trawlers to fish from Fleetwood for British markets.frtafflfflnB PPrtfftfetiffl fta?

Not long age a Fishing Company made application through the Meter Loan Committee for a licenoe for a large monthly allowance of petrol for a motor-car engine that they wore installing in a fishing beat.    The Committee pretested against the whole proceeding, pointing cut that the consumption of petrol was extravagant and the engine would prove quite unsuitable for the it   work.    &quot;Nevertheless, the Company weuld not listen to advioe, and,1    as the installation was already nearly complete, they obtained a
reduced allowance of patrol to enable them to try what the engln^T cculd do.    Tha rasult has bean a visit o  a reproeontatlve of the\ Company to this effice to admit that th* engine was a total failure!, and to aik expert adviofl ao to a suitable installation.    This is an interesting example ef tha recognition that the Committee Is winning ao a source of oorapetent advioe on the eo^iijpmont of meter fishing boats.The normal vork of the Beard proceeds on linos as . indioatad in previous BeportB.Secretary.9th August, 1918.3c
