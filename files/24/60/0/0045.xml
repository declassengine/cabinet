Ships of this class, moreover cannot be substituted * on account of their relatively small bunker capacity -for ships on oth*r and longer runs outside the extreme danger sons.After most careful consideration we are of the opinion that the responsibility for continuing to run these ships under the con-ditions which the l?irst Sea Lord sets out, should be taken.The-result of this policy may conceivably mean considerable loss of life if the worst happens.     We therefore feel that the responsibility which we advise should be taken by the Government as a whole, end we therefore ask the War Cabinet to affirm the recommendation which we make to them.(Signed).   8JU0 GJ5DDES.      J.P.MACLAY,  ft 1P,Memorandum from 1st Sea Lord to ffirst Lord.Transport [ /fork of BigpLiners Acres a the Atlantic.I think that the far Cabinet ought to realise the fact that the large ships *MAIJMTAHXA% *X^UITAMIAW, and &quot;OLYMPIC&quot; are now incurring somewhat heavier risks whilst carrying American troops than they have hitherto done.When thAse ships were first put on to this transport work, the submarine danger -mo practically confined to certain areas adjacent to the coast through which we were able to escort them.   Now however, the situation has been changed by fact that the enemy nee some submarine cruisers operating in the Atlantic, and the risk therefore of these ships being torpedoed is extended from the areas which were before considered dangerous to the whole passage across.
There appears to &quot;be no way^ydiminishlng thia rink oxci .&apos;t by taking those siiipB off tnis service and employing them elsewhere if possible.     If this were done it would mean the ejaploywent of 1(5 or 17 waaller ships to talcs their place to keep up the present supply of American troops, or else reducing tho numbers brought over by come l8,000 per month.-  he attention of the War Cabinet Is sailed to this question because it is thought that s disaster to American Troops in a British veesel in Mid-Atlantic might hnve more far reaching results in the United States than if the ship sunk were an Anerienn one.&apos;t Stoned)   Rt fc. flfc$S.
