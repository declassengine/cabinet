0 1^0]*&apos; c* j&apos;THIS DOGUkxCT IS Tiff,  ROPmi OF HIS BniTAMIO LAJESTY*S,,.GoVERIOfe.SECRET, G.T.-5334,WAp   CABINET,PROPAGANDA IN FRANCE,(Copy of Note by the Acting British Military Representative, Suprme War Council, to Secretary, \7ar Cabinet.)Reference Ho, 9/C/4,Secretary]V&apos;ar Cabinet.I think it my duty to bring before the notice of the Prime Minister the following situation.During the last few months the United States have thought it wise to take steps to carry out an active propaganda campaign in France in order to explain to the French Nation the efforts already made and those in process of being made by the American Nation.Among other devices, wonderfully executed cinema films, depicting the American Navy and American troops, are shown atall cinemas in Paris and the provinces.   These films ere notof long duration, 10 to 15 minutes, and are interspersed amongthe ordinary &quot;turns&quot; at cinema theatres.   Pushful individualstravel about France and entertain newspaper editors, and, touse their own expression, &quot;boost&quot; the Stars and Stripes.     heresult is that the French Nation think that American ships sfwar alcne take the sea and fhat the American Army is the ontymilitary power of any consequenoe besides themselves,   possiblythis situation viewed by itself is not of vital consequenceto us, but there is an important aspect of the case and thatis that British soldiers are inclined to become jealous, withthe result that a cause of friction may in time arise which isclearly to be avoided both now and when the war is finished.As a solution, I urge strongly that we take a leaf tut of the book of our American cousins and run a propaganda of our $wn on similar &quot;boosting1&apos; lines.    As regards cinema films, perhaps it is not always realised to what an extent the French Nation of all glasses, ages and sexes attend these performances.The distribution of leaflets as carried tut sy us has little effect, because I doubt whether any one reads them. Furthermore, newspaper editors are very ready to help but they like flattery and dinners and suggestions made verbally tt them of the line they should take.(Sd.)   C.
