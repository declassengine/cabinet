&apos;This DrProperty of251His Britsrnment.)LAW AS TO THE BMPIiOIHTSKT 0? PRIS0W3RS OF WAR.The principle on which the employment of prisoners of war ii based is that work is beneficial to the prisoners of war themselves.   This prinoiple was first given Conventional sanction in the Brussels Declaration of 1874 which laid down the following regulations:-Article 25.&quot;Les prisonniers de guerre peuvent ttre employSs Va oertains travaux publios flui n&apos;aient pa3 un rapport direct avec les operations sur le theatre de la guerre, et qui ne soient pas extcSnuants ou humiliants pour leur grade&quot;militaire, s&apos;ils appartiennent a 1&apos;armee, ou pour leur position officielle ou sociale, e&apos;ils n&apos;en font point partie.IIs pourront Igalement, en se conformant aux dispositions reglementaires a fixer par 1&apos;autoritl militaire, prendre part aux travaux de 1&apos;industrie privSe.&quot;Article 26.&quot;Les prisonniers de guerre ne peuvent Itre astreints dfaucune manie*re ! prendre une part quelconque a la poursuitS des operations de la guerre.Some uncertainty prevailed as to whether the effect of these regulations was to prohibit the employment of prisoners tff war on all work connected with the operations of the war or whether they could legitimately be forced to perform work of this nature at any place outside the zone of operations.The Hague Convention of 1899 embodied Articles 25 and 26 of the Brussels Declaration in a single clause and made it clear that the prohibition was intended to be general, and the provision.3 of the 1899 Convention, with the addition of a clause exempting officers from liability to work, were adopted by the Hague Convention of 1907,The regulations on the subject in the7Hague Convention of 1907 are, however, still somewhat vagus,   The&apos; Convention merely lays down that the State may employ the labour of . prisoners of war, other than officers, according to their rank and capacity, and that the work must not be excessive and must have no connection with the operations of the war.   Prisoners may also be authorised to v/ork for the public service, for private persons or on their own account.The framers of the Hague Convention of 1907 did not, however, contemplate the conditions existing in the present v/ar of the universal mobilisation of the belligerent States and the consequent fact that work of almost any kind must necessarily in such circumstances hav&quot; some connection with the v/ar,It is obvious that the existence of this condition necessitates some modification in practice of the 1907 regulations, and the extent to which they are applicable in the present war was considered earlier in the war by the German Military Courts.Their
Their conclusionswere as follows(l)   that the work cn which a prisoner of war may &quot;be employed can only he judged on the merits of each individual oaoe:(2) it is illegal to employ prisoners of war in the manufacture cf munitions intendec for use against their native country, or its allies:(3) they may he employed on agricultural or forestry work, as well as on work on military property e.g. the improvement of parade and drill grounds and of rifle ranges.(4)   they may &quot;be employed on preparative work e.g,   thetransport of coke or of ores for the manufacture of shells, &quot;because there is no direct connection between such work and military operations.(5)   ih*y can only olaim exemption from such ^ork as stands in direct relation to military operations in the area of hostilities.These conclusions appear to he perfectly reasonable. They have been approved by the V/ar Offiee and the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, France, and have been applied by the War Offioe in determining the kinds of work on wnivch German prisoners of war in the hands of the British Military Authorities may legitimately be employed.General StaffWar Office,.
