I ^ /^ j   / ?AR   CABINET.G.T.-5357,        I   *KCO-ORDINATION OF &apos;IVQRK CONNECTED v:rITH PRISONERS Off WAR.Memorandum &quot;by Lord Newton.With reference to the memorandum on the co-ordinati*n of work connected with prisoners of War (0103/G.N./478) of 5332   August 5th 1918, r   I desire to point out that much of the confusion on the part of the public is no doubt due to the fact, that several Departments answer questions relating to Prisoners of V/ar in the House of Commons, whereas it was decided by the V/ar Committee on October 26th 1916, that &quot;there should be a Member of the House of Commons appointed to answer all questions in that House.&quot;I concur with the suggestion that a Minister of high rank should preside over the meetings of the Inter-departmental Committee and believe that tbls would expedite business, because he v/ould be able to arbitrate speedily upon all minor differences arising between the Departments concerned;   but I do not consider that it would be necessary either to hold two meetings a week, or that the Minister in question should devote the.whole of his time to this particular work.(Sd.)   NEWTON.Prisoners of War Department, Royal Court,House of Lords, S,w\l, August 8th, 1918.
