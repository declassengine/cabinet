PC3T-V/AR DISPOSAL CF GOVERNMENT FACTORIES.(1)     I desire to bring to the notice of the Cabinet a letter which I have received from the Ministry of Munitions regarding the Disposal of National Factories.   It will bo seen that the procedure suggested in that letter is that tho Ministry of Munitions, with the sanction of the Treasury and the concurrence of the Minister of Reconstruction, should be empowered to dispose of the property through the ordinary departmental machinery.In this connection it will be recollected that the War Cabinet on-December 14th 1917 (War Cabinet 298, para. 3) decided that Government&apos; Pactories should not fall within the jurisdiction of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee on the Disposal of Surplus Government Stores.[2)   The Demobilisation and Reconstruction Committee of the Ministry of Munitions has. considered the question of the Post-War use of National Factories, and has submitted reports to me dealing with these Factories, group by group. Meanwhile, cases such as those indicated in the letter from the Ministry&apos; of Munitions hayo already occurred where a Factory has either already become redundant and the Ministry of Munitions are in a position to dispose of it forthwith or a firm has Intimated a desire to initiate negotiations for eventual purchase,From the point of view of unemployment during the transition period immediately following the cessation of hostilities, it is desirable that firms should be encouraged to prepare plans in advance, and this must involve in some cases proposals for the use of some of the Government Factories at present engaged on the manufacture of munitions. It/
(3)        It is, therefore, desirable that a decision should be given at an early date   which would enable tha respon-sible Departments to deal with the Disposal of Government Factories j and I am &quot;inclined to think that the procedure suggested in the letter from the Ministry of Munitions might be adopted, i.e. that the property should be disposed of through the ordinary departmental machinery, with the sanction of the Treasury and the concurrence of the Minister of Reconstruction, If the Cabinet take this view, it is,I think, necessary that they should also lay down cortain general principles upon which the Minister of Reconstruction can act in giving or refusing his concurrence to any proposed disposal,; and it is therefore proposed to set out in this Memorandum the position with regard to the various National Factories and the points of policy upon which decisions are required.It is of course understood that new qrestions of principle and individual cases of difficulty would be re- erred by the Minister of Reconstruction to the war Cabinet or Economic Defence and Development Committee,Reports have been received from the Ministry of Munitions On all the National Factories and Establishments under their control.     Particulars of these establishments are set out in&apos; Schedule A, attached herewith. (4)       It has been difficult to decide exactly where the line should be drawn between Factories which could fairly be called &quot;National&quot; Factories, and those controlled and managed by firms who have received either financial assistance from the Government for the extension of their works, or some other form of assistance such as the loan of plant and machinery&apos;   It was
fanally decided tc include in the survey of National factoriesand establishments only those either:-(a) directly managed and controlled by the Ministry of Munitions.or   (b) those in which the wages and other outgoings are paid by the Ministry of Inanitions, although the Factory is managed by a private firm under some form of agency agre eirent * thereforeIt follows/that while the degree of control exercised by the Ministry over these National Factories and Establishments varies very considerably, the Ministry are responsible as pay-masters for all the staff and labour employed.The Government may therefore be considered to be &quot;in possession&apos;1 of all these properties, although there are endless varieties in the nature of tenure. At one extreme there are factories, and among them are some of the largest ouch as Gretna and Birtly, built and equipped by the Government on land of which the freehold has been purchased;&apos; at the other extreme arc factories managed by a private firm on their own premises under an agency agreement with the Ministry of Munitions. A number of the most important National Factories have been built and equipped by the Government on land of which possession has been taken under the Defence of tho Realm Act.   In other cases possession! has been taken of existing buildings and these have been added to and newly equipped at Government expense. If it were desired eventually to dispose by sale or lease of a factory falling in either of the trio classes last mentioned it would be necessary for the Government first tc purchase the property under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1915.
17 9 i i L(5)   The factories dealt with in the Reports furnished by the Ministry of Munitions may roughly be divided into the following four categories:A. Factories which it may prove necessary to retain permanently as munitionsfactories either wholly or in part: these (apart from the Royal Ordnance Factories) number 16 to 20.B, Factories suitable for eventual disposal or use, as industrial concerns, (a small number are already redundant and might oven be disposed of at once..) The number of factories in this class is approximately 05.C *   Establishments not suitable for industrial purposes but which will probably be required during the transition period as stores or magazines, or for breaking down ammunition.     These number about 25%   Some of the large -Filling Factories are included in this classjthe sites oc&amp;Lc in some cases eventually be used for camps, or in connection with housing schemes.D.   Factories and establishments which will revert to their original owners and to their pro-war uses on the cessation of&apos;hostilities or soon after. These number about 115.(6)    I propose to set out some of the considerations which arise with regard to these four classes of establishments which should be borne in mind in deciding upon the policy to be followed in respect of each of them-.CLASS A.It will be agreed I think that the factories in Class A must remain in public ownership, but they might nevertheless, be  -leased to a suitable firm for industrial purposes on condition of their being available for the State in national emergency or on due notice being given.   The manufacturing processes for which they were used would have to be such as would not prevent their being easily convertible into IlunitlonsFactories&apos;.V/here a Factory has been built by the Government c:i land taken over but not purchased under the Defence of the Realm Act, it would be advisable that the Department concerned should be
1 7^empowered to purchase such land as would he required to make the property marketable as atwhole, and to secure for the Government the difference between the original value of the land at the time it was taken over and the added value that it has acquired as the result of the buildings that have been erected on it.Class 3VJith regard to factories In Class B, the question at once arises as to whether they should be used directly for public services by a Local or Central Authority, or whether they should be leased or sold, outright on suitable terms to private firms. Since factories have not been included in this Class unless there appears to be no prospect of their being eventually required for munitions or other war or admiralty service, it nost be considered whether they would be of service in connection with work publicly undertaken by the Government or by LocaJ Authorities, as for example power generation, housing, afforestation, agricultural development, or special industries receiving State support, such as the manufacture of artificial dyes.Class C*Factories in Group C may I think for the present be left to be used by the Storage Authorities connected with the Departments or under the Central Storage Committee presided over by Sir Charles Letcalfe.   They should, however, I suggest, be examined with regard to those that are said to be suitable for camps&apos;, housing schemes, or similar purposes, and the views of the Local Authorities respon-sible for education, housing, and other services, might beobtained in connection with the disposal of these factories.
Class DI do not think that any questions arise with regard to Group D except that in accordance with the general provision it is desirable that the owners to whom they will revert should apply their minds without delay to the problems of pest-war use *   There would appear to be no advantage to be gained in attempting to make conditions as to the return of these establishments to their original owners.(7)    It is urged that it is highly desirable that early considera-tion should be given to the question of policy involved in the disposal and use of these National Factories in order that preliminary steps may be taken at once with a view to the eventual disposal of those factories which it is decided should not be re-tanned- by the Government. Several of the National Factories are at present managed by large private firms on behalf of the Government, and in some cases the firm has an option on the purchase of the factory when it is no longer required for the manufacture of munitions..   It is, however, important in all cases that the steps necessary to carry out the decisions of the Government in regard to these factories should be taken without delay in order that firms may be in a position to make their preparations in advance for post-war developments.   The duration and extent of unemployment during the transition period will depend very largely en the progress which can be made oefore the actual cessation of hostilities by the Local Authorities and by private firms for thuir preparations for post-war work.,(8)   I, should be glad if the Cabinet could take these questions into consideration with a view to settling the principles on which the Departments may proceed.C. Addison.
M/Pemob/29MINISTRY OP MUNITIONS OF WAR,2nd May, 1918.Sir,1.   I am directed by the Ministry of Munitions to ask you to invite Dr. A.dclIson!s attention to the question of the procedure which should be adopted with regard to the disposal of National Factories, Stores and other similar establishments at present owned or taken over by this Department.   While it is unlikely that any considerable number of National Factories will actually fall to be disposed of before the conclusion of hostilities, certain factories have already become redundant to the needs of the Department and others may become so, and it Is believed that in some cases firms would bo prepared even now to enter Into preliminary negotiations with the Government with regard to purchase.    This statement applies in particular to the firms who are managing certain National Factories on behalf of the Government.2.&quot; Among the National Factories which have already become redundant owing to alterations in the munitions programme, H.M. Factory, Ellesmoro Port, may be cited as an instance.     This factory was engaged on the manufacture of an Intermediate product for picric acid known as synthetic phenol and its output Is no longer required.   In this case the Minister is advised that a better price might possibly be obtained if the factory were sold immediately, than if the sale were postponed, until the termination of hostilities.     Similar cases may well arise In the not distant future,3.   As Dr. Addison is aware, the disposal of Government Factories was expressly excluded by the War Cabinet from the purview of the Surplus Government,Property Advisory Council by the Order in Council of March 4th, 1918, and no decision has been come to as to the procedure to be followed in determining, the sale of a Government Factory, or the method by which it should be carried out and negotiated with prospective purchasers.4.   Under normal conditions, a Government Department desirous of disposing of Government property under its control, would apply forjsanction to His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, and on the receipt of this sanction would proceed to dispose of the property through the ordinary departmental machinery, which, in the case of property under the control of the Ministry of Munitions, would probably be the Lands Directorate,     This procedure is simple and direct but as the question has a bearing upon after-the-war policy, the Minister desires to invite Dr. Addis on:s remarks upon this course being followed with regard .to any National Factories or other establishments that may come up for disposal during the war./5.To the Secretary,The Ministry of Reconstruction.
5.   From the standpoint of tenure-, the properties concerned may be divided into two principal olacses:-(a) those owned or occupied under a specificc ontr- ac t or agr enmen t.(b) Those of which possession (but not ownership)has been acquired under the powers of the Defence of the Realm Acts.In case it be desired to dispose by sale or lease before the end of the War of ? Government Factory falling in class (b), the question, of the antecedent purchase of the site under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, would arise.     On this question Mr. Qhurchill is.in correspondence with His Majesty&apos;a Treasury, and copies of the letters that have passed were forwarded to Dr. Addison on April 15th, (H/Dcmob/36).6.   I am to add that a copy of this letter is being sent to the Treasury.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd) H.H. PIGGOTT,
t8CHKDDEB A.Reports on all the National Factories end Establishments under the control of the Ministry of Munitions have now been submitted to the Minister of Reconstruction,   These reports contain preliminary suggestions with regard to their post-war use or disposal, and an estimate of the probable amount of labour that will be set free on the cessation of hostilities.The Reports deal with the following groups of factories:-No of      Approx.

These number between 250 and 300 and employ-about 9,000 men and 15,000 women.     They will either continue to be used as stores, or revert to their original owners so soon as they are no longer required for storage purposes,     Several large proper-ties used for experimental purposes, for trials, for proof of guns, etc,   have also been excluded.It has been difficult to decide exactly where the line should be drawn between Factories which could fairly be called &quot;National&quot; Factories, ancl those controlled and managed by firms who have received either financial assistance from the Government for the extension of their works, or some ether form of assistance such as the loan of plant and machinery.     It was finally decided to in-elude In the survey of National factories and establishments only those either.Carried forward11 Arms Cartridge &quot;or ie11 Arms Factory go.lj^EMleio: &apos;,.,el Department IbnaT Establish
(a)   directly managed and controlled by the Ministry of Munitionsor (b)   those in which the wages and other outgoingswere paid by the Ministry of Munitions,&apos; although the Factory might be managed by a private firmon an agency agreementIt follows therefore that while the degree of control exercised by the Ministry over these National Factories end Establishments varies very &quot;considerably, the Ministry are -responsible as paymasters for all the staff and labour employed.The Government may therefore be considered to be &quot;in possession&quot; of all these properties, although there are endless varieties in the nature of the tenure.     At one-extreme there are factories, end among them are some of the largest such as Cretna and Birtley, built end equipped by the Government on land of which the freehold has been purchased;   at the other extreme are factories managed by a private firm on their own premises under an agency agree-ment with the Ministry of Munitions.     A number of the most important National Factories have been built and equipped by the Government on land of which possession has been taken under the Defence of the Realm Act.     In other cases possession, has been taken of existing buildings and these have beenadded to end newly equipped at Government expense.   If it-were desired eventually to dispose by sale or lease of a factory falling in either of the two classes last mentioned it would be necessary for the Government first to purchase the property under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916.     This fact furnishos an additional reason for taking into early considerations the possible uses to which these factories could be put and for taking the pre-liminar&quot; steps with a view to their eventual disposal
In the Reports furnished by the Ministry of Munitions tentative suggestions have beon put forward for the post-war use or the eventual disposal of a number of these factories.These may be roughly classified as follows:-(a) Factories which it may prove necessary to retain permanently as munition factories cither wholly or in part: these (apart from the Royal Ordnance Factories) number 16 to 20.(b) Factories suitable for eventual dispooal, or use, as industrial concerns, (a small number are already redundant and might even be disposed of at once.) The number of factories In this class Is approximately C5.(c) Establishments not suitable for industrial purposes but which will probably be required during the trancit-ional period as &apos;s tores or magazines or for breaking&apos; &apos; &apos;-down ammunition,     These number about 25.   Some ofthe large Filling Factories are Included In thi.3 Class: the sites could in some cases eventually be uaed for camps, or in connection with housing schemes.(d) Factories and establishments which will revert to their original owners and to their pre-war uses on the cessation of hostilities or coon after. These number about 115.It is the factories in Class (b) above which present the . most urgent and pressing problem.     Several of the factories In this class are at present managed by large private firms on behalf of the Government, and in some cases the firm has an option on the factory, when it is no longer required for the manufacture of munitions.     It is Important that negotiations for the eventual disposal of some of these factories should be entered into without delay, in order that firms may be in a position to make their preparations in advance for post-war developments.     The cluration and extent of unemployment during the transition period will depend very largely on the progress which can be made with those preparations before the actual cessation of hostilities.: 8 AUG1918
