HS/1226. HI).510\$s July  6 - Aug. 1 1910.t RUSSIA.    H. M. Government have decided to notify the Neutral Govern-mente that North Russian waters are now a prohibited area and thatneutral vessels will only be allowed to proceed to Worth Russian ports under licences issued by the &quot;British Admiralty. In April 1916 the Russian Government declared a prohibited zone which included th$ iVhite Sea and Russian waters from the Scandinavian frontier to the Kara Straits.     Teasels were only allowed to enter this zone under licence issued jointly by the Russian Government Committee in London and the British Admiralty.     This control must now necessarily be ad-ministered by the Allied patrols without the cooperation of the Russian Government.     H.M. Government consider it particularly necessary to watch the trade between Norway and North Russia.H.M. Government are anxious to relieve the economic necessities of the population in Siberia as soon as the Allied forces have estab-lished themselves.     It is felt that any relief scheme which may be carried out should be jointly approved and worked by all the inter-vening Allies.   A Committee has been formed in London to deal with the matter and an official commissioner has been appointed who will proceed to Vladivostock to supervise all the necessary arrangementswhen the scheme has been approved. H.M. Government feel that the scheme should be self-supporting, but that all profits and trading for private advantage should be rigidly excluded.. NORWAY.      The representatives of the Norwegian Government who have gate to Berlin to discuss the question of German safe conducts will also negotiate for the conclusion of a commercial agreement between the twocountries.   Sir M. ilndlay is informed that the Germans are askingfor a loan of Sr.30,000,000 for the financing of German purchases in Norway. They would require Kr.5,000,000 to be put at their disposal monthly for the period July to December 1918.   The loan would be se-
I    cured by German Treasury Bills and interest would be paid at a rate 2j$ p in excess of the ordinary discount rate of the Bank of Norway.   The Bank of Norway recently invited the other Norwegian Banks to assist in taking up this loan at a rate lf0 in excess of the ordinary discount rate, but the Bank of Norway met with very little or no support.   Sir M* Hlndlay understands that the Norwegian Banks do not like the security offered and that they will probably require a guarantee from the Norweg-ian Government before undertaking the business.There is nothing in the Norwegian Agreement to prevent Norwegian firms from receiving supplies both from Allied and enemy sources and manufacturing goods for both parties.     The Associated Governments are precluded from preventing this by the application of the Black List. We shall accordingly endeavour to secure a guarantee from firms importing supplies from the Allies that neither Allied materials nor their pro-duats will be used in any factory, plant, fishing vessel etc. which also receives enemy materials.     It will be pointed out that without such a guarantee there is no security that Allied and enemy supplies will not be employed indiscriminately in the manufacture of goods for both belligerents.5* NETHERLANDS.   M. Loudon has informed Sir W.Townley that in the forthoom-ing Agreement between Germany and the Netherlands it is provided that the Dutch shipping allotted for trade with the United Kingdom shall be limited to 15,000 tons.     The 15,000 tons will cover the whole of the Anglo-Dutch trade including pitch but exclusive Of coal.Sir W. Townley is further informed that the Dutch shipping employed in the Baltic trade with Scandinavia will be limited to 30,000 tons. The Allied Blockade Committee desire to arrange for an extension of the trade between Hollandand the Scandinavian countries in order that sur-plus Dutch agricultural produce may be as far as possible diverted from the Central Empires.   It seems that the German Government are anxious to limit the Dutch trade with Scandinavia as well as the Dutch trade with the United kingdom.     The Inter-Allied Trade Committees at Chris-
273.tiania, Stockholm and Copenhagen have &quot;been instructed to report how far &apos;t will be possible for the Scandinavian countries to import from the Netherlands a number of commodities, including meat, bone-fat, eggs, vegetable seeds, sugar, potatoes, horses, chocolate, casings and shell fish.It is reported that the Netherlands Government have refused fac-ilities for the transit over Dutch territory of German dredging materials required for work at Zeebrugge and Ostend.     The Germans are now apparent-ly arranging to send these materials to Antwerp, ostensibly for dredging the Scheldt.;* SEMI STATES.     H.M. Government have received further particulars as to the prospective shortage of coal in the United States to which we alludedlast week.   The United States Fuel Administration estimate that for the 12 months ending April 1st 1919 635,000,000 tons of bituminous coal will be required in the United States as compared with 565,000,000 tons in tlfB previous 12 months.     In the year ending April 1st 1918 only 555,000,001 TONS were produced.BRAZIL.   A firm in Brazil recently brought an action against a British firm for refusing to deliver goods owing to the fact that the Brazilian I firm were on the British Statutory List.   Judgment has been given for the plaintiff on the ground that Brazil, being a belligerent and having taken I steps to prevent dealings with enemy firms, cannot be expected to recog-jnise the British Statutory List as conditioning the lawful trade of BrazH,GERMAN SUBMARINE BLOCKADE.    The Allied Governments will shortly issue a public statement as to the attitude of the Allies towards the granting of safe conducts by the German Authorities to neutral vessels passing &quot;i . : \through the German submarine blockade.   The Germans intend by means of these safe conducts to acquire a complete control of the sea-borne trade of neutral countries.   They will only grant safe conducts to vessels I which submit to the German Naval Authorities full particulars of their ferews, passengers and cargoes.   The precise terms on which safe conducts

[Representatives of the Norwegian Government and of the Norwegian ship-owners are at present in Berlin negotiating with the German Government for a settlement of this question.The Associated Governments will point out that the German system bf safe conducts implies an illegal threat to condemn and destroy neutral shipping v/hich-refuses to accept German control.   The neutral Governments will be Informed that the Allies cannot acquiesce in such a system;   that bhey must reserve the right to deal as circumstances may warrant with neutral vessels submitting to enemy supervision;   and that all ships (sailing under enemy safe conducts render themselves liable to detention antil the conditions under which the safe conducts were issued have been [scrutinised.The following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due bo enemy activities, which ?;ere reported in the period July 26 - Aug. 1.
