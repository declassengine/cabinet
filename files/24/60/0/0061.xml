(1).&apos;&apos; Reference m......i7th August, 1918Sir,Having taken up my duties as Director-General of Pood Production on the 31st July, I &quot;beg to submit the following Report pnthe work of the Department for the week ended 6th August, 1918:-The Weather.Very little irreparable damage has been caused to corn crops during the past week either by the rain or by the somewhat severe winds.     In.some districts, especially in the Pens, small areas of corn have been laid.   Main-crop potatoes, roots and pastures have improved.     Corn has already been cut in some districts, though harvesting is by no means general yet.If good weather should be experienced during the coming . fortnight there is every reason to believe that, generally speaking, all corn crops will be harvested in excellent condition.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Prosecutions.   In Kent the occupier of 66 acres of land situate near Rodmersham has been fined  50 and  10 costs for failure to comply with a notice to plough up 17 acres of grassland. Sixteen acres of the holding were already arable and 20 acres under fruit.     In Northumberland a farmer near Reedsmouth has been fined  25 and  5 costs for refusing to plough up 23 acres of land. In both cases the notices were for cultivation, for. the 1918 harvest,
Determination of Tenancies.   During the week 1 order has been made authorising a landlord to determine a tenancy on account of bad farming.in respect of 11 acres. and 1 order has been made by the Board determining 1 tenancy on account of 74 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Provision of Land for Allotments.   Reports received from 1,182 districts show that 314,417 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917, (No,2), and 289,334 plots containing 20,84b&quot; acres have been provided.   Pur in the week 8 local authorities have agreed to acquire, in addition to the area mentioned above, 37 acres (528 allotments), for next season, including 16 seres at Great Yarmouth,The Higham Perrere Co-operative Society, which owns 17 acres of land now under allotments, do not charge rent when a tenant is called up for military service, the cultivation being carried on by the family of the man called-up. Fruit Section.   An offer made by a Belgian basket maker employ1 interned Belgians in Holland to make,baskets for export to this I&apos; country has been accepted by an Evesham firm.During the week 82 demonstrations- in fruit preserving have been given in the country, making a total of 910 such demonstrations given during the month of July.    The total deliveries- of glass jars&apos; up to July 20th by the Glassware -Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions is 4,034,028. Marketing.   During the past week a visit of inspection was made the Controller of Horticulture to Herefordshire and Worcestershi: in both of which counties marketing is in active operation.    Tin inspection showed that the aggregate of the produce collected inf and despatched from, the village depots is making a considerable contribution to the supply of vegetable food in the towns.-2r
The Auction Market recently established at Worcester is proving -successful, and each week&apos;s sales have, up to the present time, shown an increase over that of the preceding week.   The larger depots undertake not only the collection and dispatch of the produce from the surrounding village depots, but are also engaged in preserving local surpluses by means of jam-making, bottling and canning.   In some of these depots basket-making is being carried on.As an example of the amount of produce wftlch A small village may produce, It may be mentioned th&amp;t at Bodenham, Herefordshire, the surplus produce from 22 gardens has in seven weeks realised the sum of  50.Small hive:Stock.   Good progress Is being made with the Central Rabbitry of the National Utility Rabbit Association at Neasden. It is hoped that this centre will be completed by the end of the month,TECHNICAL DIVISION. Fireworm Trials.   The results of experiments carried out on various farms with regard to the control of wireworm indicate (1) that Naphthalene, vaporite, and rape dust have not had sufficient effect on the wireworm to justify their use;   (2) that leather-jackets, and, up to    certain point wireworms, can be coitftroiled by thorough cultural treatment, a good tilth being at least as important as consolidation;   (3) that beans can be grown with some prospect of success oh land heavily infested with wireworm.Treatment of Seeds.   The results of experiments carried out at Rothamsted with a new process for the cultivation of cereals, suggested by an Italian, Dr, Rossi, are now available.    The method consists in soaking the seed in ammonium nitrate, and it is claimed that the treatment will increase production and at the same time permit of an enormous reduction in the consumption of nitrogenous manure.    The Rothamsted experiments, however, gave no conclusive results, such as would justify the Department in recommending the method.
Inoculation of Leguminous Plants.   In view of the succes-s saia t have been obtained in Germany and the -United States, the whole subject has been reopened and experiments have been put in hand ascertain whether, and under what conditions, inoculation is lik to be useful in this country.     Cultures have beon prepared and vegetation.tests are now in progress.Harvesting Grain in Wet VJeather.   Enquiry has beon made into methods adopted in various districts for preserving corn which i being harvested in wet weather, and a leaflet on the sublet hag been issued for ihe information of farmers.LABOUR DIVISION. Agricultural Kabour and Military Service.   The question of the exemption of stud employees has been considered, and Committees which have raised the subject have been recommended to issue provisional vouchers pending a conference which has been arrangei with the Ministry of National Service as to the position of thes men.The difficulty of agriculturists serving in the volunt has been raised frequently during the last few weeks, and the Department have asked the iviinistry of National Service to arrangi that volunteers engaged on farm work may be excused half the usui number of drills during the months of August and September.    As regards men who are unable to attend the drills regularly owing 1 their being whole time engaged in agriculture and residing at a considerable distance from the headquarters of the corps, Commit! have been advised to approach the county Commandant with a view t obtaining leave for these mer\ during the busy seasons.     It has also been recommended in some cases that the Tribunal which grant the man exemption conditional upon his joining the volunteers should be approached with a view to this condition being withdraw Harvest Labour.   The Army Council have now decided to release 10,000 soldiers on agricultural furlough in order to assist with ingathering of the harvest in England and Wales.     Arrangements are being made to allocate these&apos; men&apos;among the various counties
where extra assistance is most required.     It is hoped that the first instalment of these men will be moved to Distribution Centres before the end of the present week.An additional 385 soldiers have been released from Command Depots during the week on one month&apos;s furlough in order to assist with the harvest, making a total of 1,508 such men sent out to date.Soldier labour *   The number of soldiers now out on farms, apart from the men released specially for harvest, is 60,227.An arrangement has been come to between the Army Courcil and the Department for the gradual withdrawal from Agricultural Companies of soldiers who have been raised to Category &quot;A&quot; during the recent medical re-examinations.    The Army Council have agreed that no such men are to be withdrawn except on the provision of suitable substitutes.     All additional soldiers attached to Agricultural Companies after the 1st instant are to be regarded as substitutes for Category &quot;A&quot; men, but no men of this class are to be withdrawn until the 15th September in order that their services may be available throughout the harvest.War Agricultural Volunteers. The number of these men now out with farmers is 1,821.Prisoners of War. The total number of prisoners now employed onagricultural work is as follows:-Prom 281 agricultural camps.............16,970Employed from other camps............... 1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms......    3601    18,538Released aliens employed in agriculture. 2,24220,580Pour weeks ago the number was tb,023.68 further schemes providing for the employment of an additional 3,635 prisoners in agriculture are under consideration by the War Office.Women&apos;s Branch.&apos;Training and Employment.   The appointment is now being made of a number of women to act as Welfare Officers to the Land Army.
These officers will work with the existing voluntary people, sue as Village Registrars and others, in supervising the members of Land Army, especially those living on isolated farms and under lonely conditions.There is now a large demand for unskilled field workers and requests for numbers of women to pull flax and to do similar work have been received from Yorkshire and Somersetshire.A, good centre for training in thatching has been arranaat Foleshill, near Coventry,    Two local farmers have arranged tjput ricks at the disposal of the women, and a member of the LandArmy who Is an expert thatCher will be in charge.On farm work.......................... 11,118Lent to Forage Department............. 143&quot;    &quot;   Timber Supplies Department.... 161In Instruction Centres.....,.......... 2,716Waiting for references to be placed intraining centres......,... 412Waiting in Depots..................... 378Waiting in their own homes..... *...... 322Total............. &quot;&quot;ToT^The total number four weeks ago was 13,770Women1s Institutes.

Thenumber of binders remains at tho figure (4,006) stated in lastweek&apos;s Report.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Fertilisers.   The production of sulphate of ammonia in Great Britain during the period September to November is estimated at 76,800 tons as against 69,000 tons in the preceding three months, and of this quantity 15,000 tons have been allocated to Scotland, 13,000 to Ireland, 25,200 tons to England and 7nrales, and the balance to meet requirements for munitions and export to France and Italy.    The consumption of Scotland was originally estimated at 40,000 tons for the year, but figures which have been collected by the Scottish Department of Agriculture show that the actual quantity used was
slightly over 60,000 tons. The question, of increasing the all oca.] tion will be considered, later when further returns are availableM but in view of the increased output for the quarter, an additional 5,000 tons is to be supplied to Scotland in advance, in order to 1 meet immediate requirements. Against this increased supply of I sulphate of ammonia, the quantity of basic slag sent from England 1 to Scotland has been reduced from 40,000 tons to 15,000 tons, whll quantity it is anticipated will be sufficient to meet Scottish requirements for the season.In the case of sulphate of ammonia and basic slag, the I applications from dealers and merchants are substantially in excel of the supply. In the case of superphosphate, dealers are less I anxious to place their orders in the early par-1- of the season, om to the fact that superphosphate is more destructive of bags when j placed in store than are the other two fertilisers. Makers of [; superphosphate are usually also makers of compound fertilisers, -al do not, therefore, press sales in the summer. A circular is beirj issued to Approved Agents urging them to place their ordors very promptly, and to induce their customers to take delivery in the I autumn so as to avoid congestion of the works and the railways 1st in the season.Seed Wheat. Arrangements have been made for the selection, purcha and distribution of limited quantities of stock seed wheat of the following varieties, &quot;Browick&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;Little Joss&quot;, &quot;Rivett&quot; and &quot;Yeoman&quot;.Great care is, being taken in order to secure seed of a high standard of purity.   Distribution will be carried out by selected agents, but the wheats may also be obtained by farmers through their local merchants.Wart Disease of Potatoes.   Proceedings have been taken by the local authority against three occupiers of allotments in Glamorgan who planted susceptible varieties of potatoes in contravention off the Restricted Districts Order of 1917 (No. 1).   A fine of  1 was inflicted in each case.
80 new outbreaks of wart disease have been reported during the present season to date.Spraying.   Owing to the recent spell of wet weather, potato blight has become more general in the southern and western counties.   The disease has now been recorded from S. Wales, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Essex, Cambridgeshire and.Lancashire, as well as from the areas mentioned in previous reports. Maincrop varieties as well as others are affected, but the disease has only been recorded from a few places, and only to a slight extent in these new districts.   In North We3t Wales blight is common in certain parts, especially amongst unsprayed crops. There is yet no definite record of the appearance of the disease in the London area where potatoes on allotments still look remarkably well, wherever good seed has been used.The recent rains have seriously interfered with spraying operations.Seed Cleaning Machinery.   One of the results of the Testing of Seeds Order has been a remarkable Increase in the demand by seed firms for new seed cleaning machinery. This alone may be claimed as ample justification of the issue of the Order from the point of view of food production. Tho demand has assumed such large proportions that it has boon found necessary to take special steps for meeting it. Arrangements have, therefore, been made with the Agricultural Machinery Branch of the Ministry of Munitions to issue to the principal manufacturers of seed cleaning plant a general permit to obtain materials and proceed with the production of all the machines that are likely to be required during the next 12 months.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, CHARLES FIELDING. Director-General.Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agriculture I and Fisheries.
