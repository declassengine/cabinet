On the other hand, the output of Merchant tonnage in the United States is somewhat higher than we thought they could possibly achieve, although or course considerably below the optimistic forecasts made in the States during: 1917.This development appears to raise one or two points of first-class importance which should be appreciated and considered by the War Cabinet.   I wish, however, to atate at the outset that I am making no complaint against our American Allies as regards their War effort. . As the Cabinet knows, the relationship and oc-operaticn between the British and U.S. Navies is as cordial and close as could be wished;  I submit this Memorandum merely so that these important questions may be raised for discussion.NAVAL.There is no doubt that broadly speaking the burden of the Allies in Naval warfare i s mainly borne by Great Britain.    The British Grand Fleet of 311 war vessels with 5 U.S. Battleships faces and holds the only serious enemy fleet we have to deal with.    As to the submarine war, H.M, Ships and Auxiliary Craft steam li million miles on escortlion ticon escort work cannot be precisely stated as we have no exact knowledge of the time spent on Patrol work but I do net think we are understating the mileage if we put it at 120,000/150,000        - miles per month.Escort work and Patrol work are performed in the Mediter-ranean by craft belonging to cur&apos; Allies for which figures are not available&apos;   but I am satisfied that it will fall far short of the 320,000 miles per month steamed by British Craft in that area.    It may, I think, safely be said that the total Allied escorting is about if million a month of which the British do  lj millions.    m anti-submarine patrol work the British do over 6,000,000 milesa month and the actual Allied patrol otherwise is comparatively negligible.The following is a general comparison of the Fleets of Great Britain and&quot;the United States divided into three main classes:-

of the, War was,roughly 18&amp; millions.   This has been reduced to 15-VlOf.h million tons at the 30th June 1918, after including 690,000 tens of enemy shipping captured in the earlier months of the War. and transfers to and from the British 7Iag, some ofwhich have to be returned at the end of the War,&quot;She United .3tales Mercantile Fleet at the out-break of trie Far, including 2 mil hens of Lake tonnage, v;as only Zi&apos;million tens&apos; &quot;today it amounts to 6x million tons including nearly 70(3,000 tons of Hfrenry tonnage, and Lake tonnage of which a considerable proportion has been made available for ocean service,&apos;.Practically the whole of the British Mercantile Fleet has to traverse the danger zone, a considerable proportion being engaged in. supplying the Allies; whereas a portion cf the American Mercantile &quot;Fleet is continually engaged;; outside the real danger zone.    British ships make repeated Journeys through the danger zone in the conveyance of American troops and stores, and a number are sunk whilst so operating.    During three months 52,  cf the American troops for Europe were carried in British ships. In addition to this service, the great bulk of the responsibility for escorting those troops and stores devolves upon the British Navy,  not only when carried in British ships but also when carried in American Shirs, Further, nearly one-half the imports into France and Italy are carried in British Ships,   it should be remembered also that the reinforcing and maintenance cf British Forces in Salonika, &apos;%,/pt0 etc. places a great strain on British snips as in addition to the voyage to Gibraltar, they have to traverse the exceptionally dangerous waters of the Mediterranean, the throughout risk beino- far greater than in the case of Troopships and Surnlv Ships crossing the Atlantic &apos; ----**i   The output cf merchant tonnage from United Kingdom &apos; a^s aunns the six months ended 30th June last amounted to /ba%000 gross tons,    During: the same period the outuutlllo^tl1Cjm Yaids     cf sh&quot;s 600 tons and over, was    * 338,000 gross tons; and we have a forecast of completions recently revised on a conservative basis, which shows thai during 191.8 these Yards will put out Merchant tonnage very considerably in excess of the output cf the United Kingdom yards.It will be remembered that a considerable amount of tonnage was on order by this Country in the United States   -when that Country declared War.    This was requisitioned by the&apos; United States Government to the extent of 684,000 gross tons, equivalent to-a deadweight carrying capacity of . nearly one million tons;   and a considerable portion of this tonnage is included. In the output of the United States in the earlier months of this year.This abnormal development,, especially having regard to the relative sizes of the two Mercantile Fleets, raises not only a War, but a post-War problem,    The British Mercantile Marine is not being&apos;rebuilt at the same speed as would, be possible if the Naval effort which the -Country Is called upon &quot;to make were not so great or if America took a larger Naval share, and the time seems opportune for considering the question of the total Maritime-effort of America and ourselves.    For the success-ful waging of the war we are equally dependent on the maintenance of the mastery of the Sea, as indeed is the
REPAIRS.The Merchant Shipbuilding output ofthis Country is restricted not o nly &quot;by the large tar ship programme which we have felt compelled to undertake;  partly because it is traditionally cur policy to be the responsible policemen of the seas, and partly because the reverse is the case with our Allies.     It Is restricted also by the large demand on our facilities, materiel and labour., for repairs and. refits both to Warships^ and Merchant 0 til PS a This aspect of the case Is most important, and -*s often not fully appreciated.   During the&apos;six months ended 30th June, 6?014 Warships and Auxiliary Vessels were repaired and refitted in the Royal Dockyards and Private  Yards of this Country;   and in addition, 106 Warships end Auxiliary Vessels of the Allies were repaired, but this number is only a beginning of further demands upon us which must I think be met in the Interests of the Alliance.The demand on cur repair facilities for United States Warships is a growing one.  By the end of the year there will be continuously under repair IS T.B.D!s, andarrangements have hadtc be made to meet this.     The responsibility for repairs was certainly that of the United States;  but to secure bee: results an exchange of effort was agreed upon.    In respect of the Naval repairs to United States vessels in 1918, Admiral 31ms is trying to arrange for 5&quot; Oilers  previously ordered by the United Kingdom.)&quot; to be handed over,    Fach country will, of course, pay for the work performed for them;. but the proposed exchange represents roughly equivalent labour output.Large as the total Warship repairing effort un-doubtedly is&quot;^ the total Merchant tonnage repairing work is much  larger,, and absorbs roughly 5Q:f more labour than Warship repairs.    During the last half-year over 13 million tons of Merchant&apos;shipping completed repairs in United Kingdom Yards, of which roughly 10 to l2i may be .. ccnsidered&quot;&quot;to be tonnage other than British.As illustrating the effort of this Country in. the matter of repairs, as compared with that  of the  United States   on the 1st April the total Merchant tonnage under .repair or remodelling in the United States Yards amounted to&quot; only 150,000 gross tons.    On the same date the tonhage undergoing repair in United  Kingdom Yards was 1,317,183&quot; gross tons.    Therefore, althcugB during the half-year the output cf new tonnage in the two Countries is about equal, we have in this Country on Merchant shins alone a repair effort ten times as groat as that of the United States. Our Mercantile Fleet &quot;today is less than 2-J times the size, and in pre-Far days it was approaching six times the size of the United States Mercantile Fleet.As the United States Mercantile Fleet grows, and is employed in trans-Atlantic service, it will undoubtedly suffer damage, both from marine risk and enemy action, and in most gases the necessary repairs will have to bewhole Alliance.I anpend an interesting statement shewing, as accurately as&apos;possible from the figures available, the present and pre-war position of the main maritime countries of the world (ether than enemy countries) as regards Overseas Tonnage.
carried cut in United Kingdom Yards, so that the demand upon our repairing facilities for Merchant ships for our Allies As likely to continue to grow, and as the preponderance of the United States Mercantile Marine grows we shall he in the position of using up more and more Is hour and material on repairs of American tonnage which could otherwise be concentratedupon new Merchant ship construction for the British Mercantile Fleet; whilst American material and workmen will be employed full blast in producing more new tonnage for the American Mercantile Fleet,As I have stated, arrangements are under dis-cussion for an exchange or effort as regards the small matter of the repair of American destroyers.    This, however, is not enough.    The whole position should be locked at from a much wider/standpoint, and I would submit for the consideration of the Cabinet that an opportunity should be taken to urge that as compensation some tonnage completed in the United States should be acquired by Great Britain who has sacrificed, and is still sacrificing her Mercantile Fleet in maintaining the Naval superiority of the Entente and in repairing allied and neutral tonnage.I have dealt only with matters concerning the Admiralty directly; but I suggest cur Merchant S&apos;ftip* building&apos;effort is being reduced, and Mercantile Marine-sacrificed.(a) By cur enormously, and increasingly, prepondera-ting Naval effort:(b) By the &apos; growing burden of Allied and Neutral shiprepairs:(c) By cur non-Military but essential contributionof shipping to bring American men and. stores to France whereby cur Merchant Ships are continualTv passing through the- danger zone, and are -:;ir.iv risk.    On the average IJ-i are lost each voyage.If the &apos;:rar continues for a few years we shall probably be left with a large fleet of Warships and Auxiliary Vessels, and a large effort in Merchant ship repair to our credit.    On the other hand, the Americans will have built up a Mercantile Fleet approaching that of Great Britain, whereas beef ore the War&apos;they only owned one-fourth of cur tonnage.It is exceedingly difficult to determine the relative Naval effort which should be put forward by the United States and this Country.    Our position as an Island Empire demands a large Naval&apos; force, whilst the fact that the United States are engaged m a land war across thousands of miles of water necessitates a Naval protecting force T&quot;rhich they do net at present-possess, and *.ghich their programme of Naval Construction even if realised, will net afford.I am far from wishing to raise discord between the two Allies on whom the successful outcome of the War so largely depends, but I feel that it is not impossible for representatives of the two Rations to meet and. agree roughly on the Naval effort due from each
.4VIf that be done, it would net he very difficult tc agree that Great Britain should be allowed to acquire in the United States merchant tonnage equivalent to the labour involved in the excess effort now put forward in Warship construction, and the labour engaged on repairs tc Warships and. Merchantmen for the Allies,    if seen a discussion were entered into it would, of course, he one for the Admiralty and Chipping Ministry jointly.   Unless some arrangement of this character is come tc the position of Great Britain as the Harrier&apos; of the For Id is serl cvsly threatened as well as her position as premier Shipbuilding Country..From a Naval point of view the question is one of high policy;   but here is also a most important economic aspect tc it both during and after the&apos; war. The main questions it raises are:-(1)   Is this Country tc continue its policy of accepting responsibility for the whole burden, of Naval warfareless such contributions as our \llies feel disposed tc make, tc the sacrifice of other vital demands on cur resources/(8)  Are we tc gc on losing shirs in our Allies1&apos; immediate interest, and repairing ships for them while they overtake us in their Mercantile Marine ?This second question is only part of a much larger one, including the provision of many articles tc cur Allies, e.g, Guns, Equipment, Clothing, Machines and Engines,, Material, Coal, Ht.ee 1, -etc./tc the detriment of the size of cur Army,nhe first question is one upon which I would like tc have the guidance of the War Cabinet after aiscussi.cnh as it essentially &quot;affects the programme of construction for 1920 delivery &quot;which we are now preparing and which I must discuss with T.*r Roosevelt before he gees back to America.(Glgned)   FPIC (mm.lugusi 19.1?
