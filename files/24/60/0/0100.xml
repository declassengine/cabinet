ent isDESIRABILITY OF SUGGESTED RELAXATION OF FOOD RESTRICTIONS IN VIE?; OF TONNAGE SITUATION.ritannic Majesty&apos;8 Oo^ynu MINISTRY  OF  SHIPPING .The Shipping&apos; Controller thinks it desirable to make the following observations on the Food Controller&apos;s report (GcT,5343) as to the establishment of the Food Council and certain resolutions by that body.The Shipping Controller is in entire agreement with the establishment of an Allied Food Council and the policy of arranging allied programmes of food requirements through an allied body of this character.He thinks it necessary, however, to point out the great danger which will be involved to other supply services, e.g. munitions and army supplies generally if any action is taken as a result of resolutions of the Food Council which may result in any form of increased consumption.It will be remembered that tho memo issued by Lord Lee indicated that the success of the efforts of the Food Production Department would be followed by a very large tonnage saving and such a saving is very badly needed.The general tonnage position may be summarised in a fewwordsWorld production of shipping including America now exceeds world losses, and it is this fact which has rendered the increase of the Allied Forces in Franco possible, but everynew American ship must be allocated to the American Army which will in addition continue to require assistance from the European Allies unless their Military Programme is to be reduced.Meantime the building of the other Allies and indeed of the world generally is still month by month less than the losses.   It is clear moreover that the limiting factor to the American Army will be the extent of the tonnage available to &apos; maintain.their supplies, and it may be stated roughly thatevery
30Severy 5000 tons of imports into Europe saved will mean that 1000 more American soldiers can be kept supplied in France and therefore that 1000 more soldiers can be despatched than would otherwise be practicable.In these circumstances it is clear that any form of relaxation which involves increased consumption inevitably involves a corresponding reduction in the American Army.   It is of the utmost importance therefore that any saving that can be effected through better harvests in all the Allied countries should be used first to compensate for the net loss of European tonnage (and the net losses of world tonnage outside America amounted to If million tons deadweight in the first six months of this year) and afterwards to enable the tonnage in the American Supply programme to be brought to the highest possible figure,The Shipping Controller must therefore express his emphatic dissent from the following recommendations of the Pood Council to the respective Governments(1)    That the milling extraction should be reduced to QOfo in order to ,make bread more palatable,]?or the above reasons the need for economy is as great as it has ever been, and the Shipping Controller is unable to see the justification for relaxing restrictions which do not appear to have involved any intolerable hardship upon the population during this last year.    A lower milling extraction is undesirable partly because it means a greater proportion of grain for a given quantity of bread and partly because by rendering bread more palatable it will necessarily increase consumption.   The first effect is to some extent, though not completely, compensated for by the use of offals for feeding stuffs, but in general it is much less expensive in shipping to import meat or bacon rather than feeding stuffsto
310to produce the meat, and the increased consumption of broad may be taken as practically a net loss. In general, however, it is perhaps sufficient to point out that under last yearJs pressure for economy the high extraction was deliberately and rightly decided upon and that the need for economy being quite as great now the same pressure should clearly be continued.The general question of milling extraction was referred on G/f .5153 to the Economic Defence &amp; Development Committee who are now awaiting a report from the Food Controller on the subject but in view of the resolution passed in the meantime by the Food Council, the Shipping Controller has thought it necessary to bring his views directly to the notice of the War Cabinet&apos;without delay,(2)    The Food Council expressed dissent from the principle suggested by the Transport Council vrtdch was that in the framing of the Food Programmes the actual consumption during this last year should be taken as setting the maximum limit to the new programmes,, i,e. that imports should be the same as last year minus any net increase in home production and subject to any necessary adjustment in order to keep stocks above but not unnecessarily above the point of danger.     The Shipping Controller fully concurs in this principle.    He considers that in a situation in which every 5000 tons of extra consumption means the loss of 1000 soldiers in France the civilian population of the European Allied countries may justly be asked not to enlarge their scale of consumption in the 5th year of the -war above what it was in the 4th.The Food Council suggest instead the principle of employing the same amount of tonnage on imports this year as last.   This would in effect mean giving the entire advantage of increased harvests in this country, France and Italy and also of the increase in the wheat harvests in ilorth America which enableswheat
311wheat to be brought from the nearest source to enable food consumption to be increased.     This would involve throwing the whole effect of the net losses of European Allied tonnage upon the imports of munitions and all materials required for industry      at a time when the demands for munitions will obviously be increased, and it would certainly involve a serious reduction in the American military supply programme.In the 5th year of the war, the pressure upon all belligerent countries naturally tends to become greater and not less.   This has clearly been the case with man power, finance and trade generally.    It therefore seems to the Shipping Controller unjustifiable that in food an increased consumption should be allowed.The Shipping Controller submits that the Cabinet should decide that no action should be taken tending to result in increased consumption for the ensuing year as compared with the year which is past.J. P.- Mac lay13th August 1918.
