His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.; 1djThis Document is the Property ofHJUS 0 B E 11     -0,1,-5349.        j   : i^R^A^IJLlJ.MAN-POWER   IN   THE WOOL TEXTILE TRADE,Memorandum &quot;by Sir Charles Sykes, K.BftE.... Director of Wool Textile production,        . .It is urgently necessary to draw attention to the danger Which now threatens Army supplies of clothing and felt essential fer shells,&apos; guns, aeroplane engines, etc. by the disorganisation &apos;,qf the Wool Textile Industry by the present extent and methods of recruiting.Army&apos; Supplies.   The Government demands upon the output of the &quot;trade are approximately &amp;0%, and are increasing.   Prom August onwards the Government demand will be about 40$ in excess of the programme during...the first six months of this year.Owing to loss of material in Prance and elsewhere and the increasing size of the Allied Armies issues of many service items have been more than doubled,e,S* Great coating;.   Jt was decided early&apos; this year that anaverage delivery of 75,000 yards per week would meet all demands up to 1S1$,  -The average quantity now required is almost j5pp,000 yards per week during the rest of this year,  ,   .&apos;Serge for tunics.   The present demand is 640,000 yards per week compared with deliveries during&apos;the &quot;last 72 weeks of .350, 000 yards per weelf.&apos;,&apos; .     Plena el is increased from 1-J million yards per week last . year to 3 million yards per week at present.Pelt required for every form of munitions, for shells, :.   aeroplanes, submarines, etc, as well as in the. -production of various fats and oils, equally necessary lor the Ministry of Pood and the Ministry of Munitions, is almost doubled in demand, and. the same applies t.p hundreds of other items,India.   The new Indian Army is making increasing demands Upon this country for production, and, unfortunately^ supplies have recently, been sunk upon the way to India and must be replaced,,.  America,&apos;  The production of wool textile goods in  his country for replacements on account of the American Army is likely to be one af the most important, factors in the situation, ahd if this production is to be met the protection of man-power in the Wotl Textile trade is essential,Before the latest recruiting measures were undertaken the margin of safety was already very narrow and would probably have disappeared in any pase owing to the largely increased orders for military goods received during the -last, two months.   The position, however, has now been rendered critical by the calling-up of a substantial proportion of the very small male staffs of the woollen mills.   During tne last day or so Grade III. men of over forty years of age even have been called up.   70^ of the employees, of the trade are females and it must be pointed out that in many cases as many as 1Q0 women and young persons are engaged for ^very man even of the extended: military age.The
The total number of men who can &quot;be extracted from the Wool Industry by any recruiting measures, howoyor severe,&apos;,i&apos;s relatively very small and the greater number of those men will be of poor military value to the Army.   Doing the work which they arc doing -at present,, their military value is great,- especially if we take into account the equipping of the American Ar:;,y.   Tho total number of men of all grades which can possibly bo obtained from tho Wool Textile trade is considerably less than one. clay&apos;s addition to the American Armies in Europe.   It is&apos; difficult to measure tho evil consequence which may result from their being mistakenly transferred into the Army.Further, as the Y/ool, Textile trade is not a protected trade tl,e men of older categories skilled in the industry are leaving it and registering for work of national importance in order to avoid the possibility of being called-up.   This position is ludicrous.Political .,G,onsicfcrations.   Equally witlv the. question of supplies,., there&quot;! a; howev c r ^ahOtSer problem,-serious and urgent, to be faced.     The inherent difficulties, of the- problem are increased by the fact that the relations between the recruiting authorities and the trade are extremely strained.   A feeling of distrust and lack of confidence exists- throughout the trade-towards the present system of recruiting..&apos;  By perpetuating the present machinery and by continuing to drain men from;- tho indsutry whilst, at the same time expecting..to maintain supplies;we are rapidly heading for-political trouble of a serious nature.,:-There is an under-current of Pacifism especially at Bradford but &apos;it is a. mistake to interpret the present feeling so far as Labour is concerned in terms of this minority section.   At the same ,&apos;time, it is equally a mistake to ploy into the hands of this section, which is what is happening at the present time.The political aspect of the matter h s recently been,raised at :a meeting of the General Union of Textile Y/orkers, and directly arising on the discussion on - the present position with: regard to recruiting in tho trade it*was &quot;decided to ballot the . whole trade on &quot;peace by negotiation.&quot; -&apos;   This feeling is expressed in a letter recently addressed by the leader of the &quot;win the &quot;.7ar&quot; labour section of the &quot;trade, to the department, in which he states &quot;if the present system continues there is trouble ahead, and I am bound, to&apos; say it- shall have my entire sympathy.-&quot; . irritating instances occur -every day&quot;-Which,, while small .in .&apos;thcm selves, have an accumulative effect far beyond tho merits .of the individual instances concerned..proposals... -The first--essential is to produce, goodwill -in the trade and-.this can only be achieved by giving to the .trade a . share of reel responsibility in the matter;   I therefore suggest:-(1)   The trade should.- be recognised as munitions of war and Its workers definitely protected,   Without this provi-sion the trade will very.soon be denuded of its older , men who will go into protected industries. ^(3)   Recruiting in the trade should be at once stopped and. oil men&apos;who have received&quot;calling-up notices given administrative protection.Unless this is dono Army: supplies cannot, be guaranteed.(3)   Suspension of recruiting, should take...place for at -least two months;, -rnd. the-Board-of Control of Wool Textile Industries equally representative of employers and workpeople throughout the..whole of the trade, &quot;together with representatives .of the. Wool TextileDeportment -
Department - in faot the Pariltament of the trade-sharing responsibility with the Department responsible for military supplies should, after careful investi-gation of the man-power of the trade in relation to Army demands, suggest the number of men, if any, who mi  $it &quot;be spared for the Army.(4)   To the;Wool Control Board should be enirusted the task of selecting the men required by the Army, and it should have the poV/er definitely to protect those essential to production,Hote.   he political difficulty which may be raised with regard toJv7hat is virtually a transfer of powers from the local Tribunals is noi so serious as at first appears; and in any case not as serious as the political difficulties which will be raised if tho present ,system le allowed to persist.   The number of workpeople in the Woollen and Worsted1 trades, including Hosiery, is about 250,000(Sd.) CHARLES SYKES.Department of Wool Textile Production, War Office,Bradford.August 3rd, 1918.
