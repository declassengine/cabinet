i a.Aug.  ad : 6th, 1916/&quot;RUSSIA;Tho British Economic Mission in Russia arrived at Archangelon July 29th and embarked for the United Kingdom,   The Economic Mission durinsr their stay in Moscow interviewed the Bronski Committee for Trade ana the Gukowski Committee for Finance,   These interviews were unsatisfactory.     Ho guarantees were forthcoming that British firms in Russia would receive compensation for the nationalisation of their enterpriser:1.     EC. Bronski professed to desire a resumption of oominer -cial relations with the United Kingdom and stated that Russia must obtain machinery and coal either from Great Britain or Germany,   He represented that all transactions should be carried out between the Governments concerned and suggested that the Russian oil, mines and timber concessions should be worked jointly by the Russian Government and the British concessionaires.   The Russian Government would find the labour and the British concessionaires would find the machinery and the engineers,     M9 Bronski&apos;s proposals were vague and offered no practical basis for negotiations.DKBMARK.     The Banish Government now seem genuinely anxious to conclude an agreement with the Allies.     The Danish Minister for Foreign Af-fairs, in an interview with Sir R, Paget, said he feared that Denmark may lately have seemed to be drifting away from the Allies.     He de-sired to remove any such impression.    The Danish Minister at Wash-ington has simultaneously protested to the War Trade Board that Den-mark desires a speeay settlement.    Sir R. Paget understands that the Danes are prepared to close with the Associated Governosents even though it should be necessary to accept our proposals both as regards tonnage and as regards the exports of Danish produce to Germany.The War Trade Board are satisfied with the Danish shipping pro-posals as they now stand.     The Danish tonnage offered still fells short by 10,000 tons of the 465,0)0 tons for which we originally asked;     but the War Trade Board estimate that under the new propo-sals we shall obtain 288,000 tons of Danish shipping for the war zone
221fa t-J X2.as compared with 103, OOO ton a at present employed in dangerous ser-vices&apos;.     The Danish government have sent a represents tive to Berlin to induee the Germans to agree to certain ooncessions necessary to the carrying out of the proposed Agreement with the Allies.  Among other things they arc asking the German Government to allow Banish vessels sailing to South America to carry cargo from the United States to South America on the outward voyage.The Banish delegates at Washington are apparently willing to ao-cept the restrictions on the exports of Danish produce to Germany which the Associated Governments agreed in December last to regard as essential.The Germans have agreed to release the Banish coal vessels re-cently t sit en into Swine munde (vide Summary July 19 th-2 5th) on receiv-ing assurances ffeom the Danish Government that the vessels in ques-tion will sail in ballast to the United Kingdom to fetch coal exoUu sively for Danish cons imption,Sir K. Paget is informed that during the recent negotiations for a renewal of their commercial Agreement&apos; with Denmark the Germans endeavoured without success to male arrangements for trade between the two countries after the war.     They specifically proposed that the Panes should allow them the option of purchasing the whole of thi surplus of Danish agricultural produce for a period of five years. They also approached the Danish Associations, the East Asiatic Com-pany and the United Shipping Company with prop o sals for post be Hum trade.     Their proposals were in all cases declined.5MMMM !i*   ^&amp;e Uetherlands Government, like the Danish Government hove indicated a change of attitude.     The last communication of the Netherlands Government regarding the proposed general Agreement with the Allies was clearly intended. to postpone a settlement indefinitely (vide Summary July 19th to B5th).   M. London in a private letter to Sir 1. Townley now asks whether it would be possible for H.M, Govern-raent to proceed with negotiations for- an Agreement without delay. He offers to talk over with Sir I, Townley any matters whioh may need
clearing up before negotiations are actually renewed arid intimates jty 1  that in his opinion a speedy settlement ia of the utmost importance.The Nether lands Government have stated officially that, pending the formation of a new Ministry, it is impossible for them to conclude a General Economic Agreement with Germany.   Meantime the Germans have agreed to supply the Netherlands with 120,000 tons of coal per month for the five months beginning August 1st, at PI.90 per ton.   A credit of 30 florins will be put at the disposal of Germany for every ton of coal supplied.    The arrangement 1b torminable at a fortnight&apos;a notice as from October 15th.    Presumably the (Jermana will not continue send-ing coal to Holland after October 15th unless an Agreement has in the meantime been reached regarding the export of Dutch produce to Germany. It has hitherto appeared to be the policy of the Netherlands Govern-ment to .delay an Agreement with the Allies until they had satisfied the requirements of the Central Empires;   but this policy now seems to have been reversed.     It is significant that the Dutch representatives who have been negotiating with Germany for shipbuilding materials have approached Sir W. Townley with a view to obtaining supplies of British steel*     H.K. Government are carefully considering their proposals.SPAIH.      H.M. Government have reason to believe that the Spanish Gov-ernment may shortly take an important decision possibly involving a rupture of diplomatic relations with Germany.   The deepest resentment has been aroused in Spain by the sinking of a,s. &quot;Ramon de Larrinaga&quot; carrying supplies for Spain.     ?he Spanish Government are moreover greatly Impressed by the military successes of the Allies in France and by the rapid development of American military power.SWIIZBK&amp;AiSED.     Under the Agreement recently concluded between the Swiss and German Governments the &quot;Federal Government undertook to set up an organisation on the lines of the 8.S.S. to supervise thediatri-but ion of German goods imported into Switzerland.   The arrangements for setting up this organisation have now been made.   It will comprise fifteen members nominated by the Federal Council.   There will be four syndicates which will deal respectively with   (a) coal,   (b) iron,
steel and other metals,   (c) chemical and pharmaceutical products and (d) miscellaneous goods.    The new organisation will aupervise*all imports from Germany and the re-export from Switzerland of all corn-mod it iea manufactured with tho aid of German materials.awmi BVmmiM BTiOCKADB.    Owing to representations received from H,M. Ministers in the neutral countries affected, H,M. Government are postponing the public statement of the Allied attitude towards German safe-conducts for neutral shipping to which we referred last week.The Allied Ministers at the Hague consider that a declaration in the terms suggested would effectually stop all sailings from Dutch ports and put the Associated Governments in the wrong with the Dutch public.Sir B. Paget thinks that the declaration would embarrass the Dan-ish delegates in their negotiations with United States War Trade Board at Washington.     It would, moreover, disorganise the whole of the pre-sent Danish shipping services, as virtually all Banish ships sail at present under German safe-conducts, including the ships which carry agricultural produce to the United Kingdom.In the case of Sweden the Germans are attaching conditions to the issue of safe conducts which would preclude the export to the enemies of Germany of any Swedish goods manufactured from imported commodities. Sir E. Howard has represented to the Swedish Government that such a stipulation would make it impossible for Sweden to observe the clause of the new Swedish Agreement guaranteeing Swedish exports to the Allies. 31, lal lenberg assured Sir 32. Howard that the new Agreement irould be observed.   He declared, however, that the Swedish shipowners would never have consented to the Swedish Agreement if they had anticipated that the Allies would raise any objection to the system of German safe-conducts and he asked that no action might be taken until he had put the matter before the Swedish Cabinet,     Sir E. Howard believes that our declaration In the terms proposed would lead to a denunciation ofthe new Agreement.Similar difficulties seem bound to arise in the case of Norway.Mr. Ovey at Christiania thinks that tho proposed declaration should
Hibe communicated to the Norwegian Government as soon as possible as it may dot or them from making arrangements with the German Government whioh cannot be sanctioned by the Allies.    The Norwegian representa-tivea who recently went to Berlin to discuss this question with the German Authorities have -returned to Christian!a without reaching an&apos; Agreement.   M. Ihlen realises that the conditions attached by the . Germans to their safe-conducts may involve Norway in a breach of the new Norwegian Agreement,   As in the case of Sweden the Germans are demanding that Norwegian vessels sailing under safe-conducts shall carry no cargo which may ultimately benefit the Allies.   Mr. Ovey, in discussing the matter with M. Ihlen, pointed out that it would be a violation of the Amerioan-Norwegian Agreement if cargo required for Norwegian factories which manufacture for the Allies were refused by a Norwegian vessel. *Sir A. Hordinge has informed the Spanish Government of the Allied attitude and no exception was taken.   The Allied representa-tives all agree thot the declaration will have an excellent effect 4n Spain.The following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reported in the period Aug.2-8 inclusive.
