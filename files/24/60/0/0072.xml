Licensed Victuallers&apos; Defence League of

England and Wales,

Bridge House,

181, Queen Victoria Street,

London, E.C.

August 9th, 1918.

To Lieut.-Col, Sir Maurice Hankey, K.C.B.,

Secretary, H.M.&apos;s. War Cabinet,

2, Whitehall Gardens,

S.W.1.

Dear Sir,

In compliance with instructions from the Parliamentary Committee of the Licensed Victuallers&apos; Defence League I must respectfully ask you to submit to H.M&apos;s War Cabinet the enclosed Resolution, which was passed unanimously by the Parliamentary Committee at its meeting London on August 8th, in the earnest hope that H.M&apos;s War Cabinet  will grant permission for an increased supply of Beer at an early date.

Yours most respectfully,

(Sd.) H. Geo. Robinson.

Parliamentary Agent.

Moved by the President of the League (Councillor Wm. J. Coates, of West Hartlepool).

Seconded by Mr, Harry Rogers (of Swansea, representative of Wales) and unanimously RESOLVED:-

This Parliamentary Committee of the Licensed Victuallers&apos; Defence League of England and Wales most respectfully submits to H.M&apos;s War Cabinet that as the actual reasons advanced for the very drastic curtailment of the manufacture and supply of Beer have to a large extent disappeared, especially in regard to the use of barley for bread production, the restrictions on malting and brewing should be considerably modified so that the quantity of Beer brewed may be increased to meet the reasonable needs of the public in whose interests the Beer brewed ought not to be of a lower specific gravity than 10.24 degrees; the Committee therefore earnestly appeals to H.M&apos;s War Cabinet to modify the existing restrictions on production so that the Ministry of Food may bo enabled to provide an increased supply of Beer at a minimum specific gravity of 10.24 degrees.
