(Tim D. - ,,rr,f: &apos; &apos;   fto iv;on      of     v Hi- Mlt)The League of Nations. 213 LECTUREby theRight Hon. G. N. BARNES, M.P.(Labour Representative in the War Cabinet),at theUniversity Extension Summer Meeting,Cambridge,MONDAY,  AUGUST 5TH,   1918.Introductory.I am here to-day to plead for the inauguration of means by which to suppress war. But first let me say that I am not here to speak of peace when there can be no peace.There can be no permanent peace until the cause of the present war is uprooted from the soil it has poisoned for generations.This war began because of German ambition, and the instrument of&apos; German ambition is the German Army. The army is under one man, and he a survival of a world out of date.Speaking to his troops in 1914, the Kaiser said:   &quot; Woe and death to those who resent my will.  Woe and death to those, who do not believe in my mission.   Let all enemies of the-Germans perish.  God demands their destruction.&quot;The German people have tacitly accepted responsibility for the Kaisers speeches and the militarist actions; actions which have branded them with the mark of the beast and outraged the moral sense of the world. That, to my mind, is the most appalling and arresting fact of the war.Many&apos; among us had cherished a hope that the advent of democracy would in itself have been enough to banish war from the world. That hope has been shattered. There may be no cause of quarrel between peoples, but peoples have been led to
believe otherwise, and the German people, moreover, have been duped into the belief that German &quot; kultur &quot; should be imposed on the world for the world&apos;s good as well us for the expansion of German power.We must, therefore, guard against such teaching. &quot;We must somehow ensure that if there be fire-eaters in the future their pernicious doctrines will fall on barren ground.The First Task.But the exorcising of the spirit of militarism is our first task. The Prussian machine has, however, so far been sufficiently effective to encourage the Prussian military autocracy. If peace, therefore, were negotiated now it would leave Prussian militarism over the German people still unbroken and its power still strong for another struggle. And that would mean generations of military preparation, during which compulsory military service would be a general feature at all events in the Old World, and possibly in the New. There would be no escape.The militarists here would say that we had been unprepared in 1914 and must not be caught napping again. The militarists in Germany would, of course, say that their militarism had justified itself. There would be no logical answer either in Germany or Great Britain.That is why I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not here to speak&apos; of ending this war till Prussian militarism is defeated.What I am aiming at, and what I am here to propose, is the inauguration of some international organisation which shall predicate the downfall of Prussian militarism as the indispensable preliminary. That is our first duty ; our second is to make provision so that the cause of this war should not be left to cause another war.Beyond this War.Another war of the nations would be to this, as this has been to all others that preceded it. Science has made great strides during the last few years, and has been applied during the war to destructive purposes to a degree which should be a warning to mankind.It is only ten years ago that aviation started. Yet we have now each of the main belligerent countries in this war with thousands of aeroplanes dropping tons of bombs on civil populations. In ten years time it is not too much to say there might be tens of thousands of such aeroplanes brought into existence by each belligerent, and that those aeroplanes would be then of increased range and power.What is true of aeroplanes may also be said of submarines. These wasps of the ocean have already revolutionised sea warfare. Arid submarines may be multiplied by the hundred during this next ten or twenty years.
But another element has come in during this war. That is poison. We have only begun to use poison gas; liquid poison even has been talked about, if not actually employed.There is nothing to prevent poison liquid or gas being used in fHnother war of the nations. Such a war is, in short, unthinkable. &apos; xt would bringdown the pillars of civilisation. Even the preparation for it might put back the clock&apos; for centuries. The world would be demoralised thereby, not only economically, but morally. For not only would money be spent in armaments, which should be applied to the rebuilding of the social fabric, but the public mind would be poisoned by the subtle influences which are part and parcel of militarism, and which make so many of its votaries impervious to the liner things of life. Militarism in Germany has found its supreme expression, but militarism everywhere is the same in kind, if not in degree. There is a psychology of the gun which is the danger.The Economic Boycott.How, then, can we combat it? Can we do anything now to pave the way? 1 think- we can. 1. think we must, or otherwise, when the war ends, peoples will be so weary that they will fail to take steps against the recurrence of war. How, then, can we devise the means of safeguarding the peace when it comes?It is a stupendous problem, to the solution of which I should feel oth to apply myself, but that others have pointed the way by the idvocacy of a family of. nations, banded together in such a way as to keep the peace among them. That is but an expanded application t)f the principle of the British Empire, which already keeps the peace within the British Dominions; and of the principles already [unbodied, in a tentative way, in Hague Conventions.President &quot;Wilson has put it in an expressive formula in a speech le made at New York a few weeks, ago. He said :  &apos; &quot; Let us make an arrangement by which we will give bonds. Let us have a common guarantee that all of us will sign a declaration )f political independence and territorial integrity. Let us agree that f anyone of us, the United States included, violates the political independence or territorial integrity of any of the others all the 1thers will jump on her.&quot;These terse words embody the fundamental, idea of a League of fations. Each country would become party to the common efensive alliance, and each would undertake to act with all the thers against any one who was. false to. the terms of that alliance, t does not necessarily mean that the offending nation would bejumped on &quot; in the military sense, for there are other resources f civilisation which might be first applied. Nations are now more ependent upon one another than ever before; the world is more iterdependent.
Through the ramifications of trade, commerce, and finance, and facilities generally, including access to harbours and raw materials, the nations arc becoming more and more members one of another, Spain, for instance, produces iron ore, but has no coal, Great Britain has both, but is dependent upon other countries for, among other things, cotton, coffee, tea, and fruit.Germany has no jute, and is dependent for its supply on shipments from India; for its cotton from America or the British Dominions. The United States of America is probably the only country which is, or could be, self-supporting as regards raw material, but even America, would be hard hit if denied the reciprocal advantages of finance and trade with the Old World.It is safe to say that an economic boycott against a nation might in many cases be quite sufficient to enforce compliance with treaty obligations, for it would deprive that nation of the means of its normal life. The economic boycott would be the first weapon used against a recalcitrant nation.The Use op Armed Force. But there must be a provision made for the military weapon in the hist resource.   An economic boycott must have a backing of armed force.A nation might conceivably live on its vitals for a time in order to try and win its way through to the gain of aggression unless it knew that sure and swift punishment awaited it as a consequence of so doing.President Wilson plainly assumes agreement in regard to the use of armed force. Speaking the other day at Washington&apos;s tomb, he put as one of the great aims of the war on the part of the Allies the &quot; establishment of an organisation of peace which would make it certain that the combined power of free nations would check every invasion of right.&quot;Mr, Asquith has expressed himself in definite terms, for he has said that an international authority &quot; must be supported in case of need by the strength of all that is, in a last resource by armed forces.&quot; Air. Balfour, and, indeed, every responsible person who has given the matter any attention at close quarters, has reached the same conclusion.Armed force, then, is a necessary and indispensable complement of the economic boycott. The two together form the twin instrument for suppression of acts of aggression on the part of ambitious militarism.For my part T submit that the mobilisation and control of such a force cannot be safely left to chance when the time might come for its application.It should be pre-arranged, or otherwise there would be a danger of its missing fire in the clash of conflicting interests and ambitions which would then arise, Our experience in this war has shown how
of.it fcy ts 3din ofler it icelse heshe it3&apos;rylas ase led idio aedtime can be wasted in fruitless discussion of rival claims and interests. There has been sufficient force on the side of the Entente Powers to have brought victory to our side long ago, but it has been applied unevenly and without co-ordination, and some of it so late as to be, as yet, of little value in the common cause. These things iiould be arranged as a matter of international organisation before, and not after, the occasion for force being applied.The Question of Sovereignty.This raises the whole question of sovereignty. Contracting nations will, of course, be loth to surrender any part of their sovereignty. But there is no alternative. If the world is to become a civic whole, there must be subordination of the parts. And, indeed, if the nations will only face the alternative, the terrors of lessened sovereignty will be dispelled in the contemplation of the greater terrors of devastating war. There can be security by subordination, or there can be war without it, and there is no middle course consistent with freedom.Professor Ostwald, a German publicist, gave us fair warning in August, 1914, when he said &quot; that the principle of absolute sovereignty in individual nations was to be given up.&quot; And the German Chancellor has quite recently dotted the i&apos;s and crossed the t&apos;s of the professor, when he expressed agreement with the principle of a League of Nations, and said that Germany would take the leading part. She has already taken the &quot;leading part&quot; in Russia and Koumania. It is the part which she had set out for herself long ago, when at the Hague Conference she opposed obligatory arbitration and led Austria and Turkey with her in her opposition. Doubtless she acted on the assumption that the empire of the world would pass again in modern times, as it did in the Eoman period, to the nation best fitted to win war. Two ideas are really struggling for supremacy in the world. The one is &quot; Live and let live,&quot; the other &quot; Live as I let you.&quot; If the first is to survive there must be a I little less national sovereignty on the part of all the nations or none at all except on the part of one.Ouit Attitude to Gehmany.What is to be our attitude towards Germany in a League of ent (Nations?ent I   I was recently taken to task by numerous critics when I ventured ous to say that she should be included.  It was said that I-had proposed Ito confer a favour on Germany.  &quot; If the idea is carried out,&quot; says a )h a j well-known publicist, &quot; the League will clasp Germany to its bosom for land hail her as. a sister in the cause of peace.&quot;I This, of course, is all nonsense.ibrisl ^ decent, law-abiding citizen does not clasp the burglar to &quot;his k jbosom, although both are subject to the same law and both alike -hare in its protection.
1 would include Germany in a League, of Nations just us we include the thief and the burglar, as well as the decent, law-abiding citizen, in our national affairs. The laws of a nation cover all alike, good and bad. All are required to contribute to the maintenance of the policeman, the judges, and the jailers. And all are required to obey tho law or take the consequences. We must apply the same principle internationally.I would include Germany in a League of Nations all nations-because to exclude her would simply mean reversion to old dangers. There were two Leagues of,Nations before the war, but they didu&apos;t prevent it. On the contrary, they competed in such a way as to precipitate it. There was no option on the part of those who had to follow Germany&apos;s lead.  The world cannot return to that race again.The whole object of the war, on our part, might be said to be to prevent any Power again leading in such a race and falling on her neighbours as Germany did in the past; and I really don&apos;t see how it can be done except through an organisation of which she is part, and to the conditions of which she shall be compelled to subscribe.To speak, as some do, of the Entente Powers themselves forming an exclusive League of Nations, and leaving Germany, with her vassal States, to form a rival League of Nations, is merely to be blinded by the smoke of present battle and to be bereft of reason in contemplation of German barbarities.Reduction oe Armaments.   .In short, a League of Nations must be the League of Nations. It is the only way. Competition in armaments, with spasms of world war, must cease if there is to be assurance of peace in the world. There must be full knowledge of armament building by each on the part of all and limitation of each by all to the amount required for the maintenance of order.Regulation and restriction must take the place of competition. Experience has proved that the existence of the means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done. Nations in arms are inevitably tempted to use those arms, just as a little boy with a pop-gun develops a liking to practice with it.  It is human nature.But there is another reason for the reduction of armaments. A new situation will emerge after the war. Firearms have been dangerous in the past, mainly because of danger of external war. But, with the new ideas which are now surging in the minds of great masses of people, firearms will be a danger internally as well as externally. There must be a new order aiter the war. Labour is not going back to the old position of dependence and subordination. It will take its rightful place in the world of industry as a partner and sharer in the responsibilities of management in all that relates to its citizen rights and in the maintenance of decent standards of life. It is generally recognised that this will tend to the common good. All the best elements in the community are agreed on it. The Whitley Report and recommendations are the practical expressions of that agreement.  But the ideals will have to be worked
I out with great skill and much patience at a time of great stress due I to demobilisation, All classes will have to help in the creation : of a now world by way of peaceful and orderly evolution. And ] that is quite incompatible with the existence of great armies, j The existence of those armies would be a menace a danger. Their I ery presence would be provocative, their cost would be ruinous. \ They would inevitably land us into anarchic revolution by the impoverished masses of the people. There must never again be the j great armies of the past.  That way madness lies.Elimination of Private Profit.1 But let us look back a little. From whence come those I bloated armaments which weighted down the nations before thewar ? Mainly from the workshops of the private manufacturer, who I used ail the means open to him to push his wares and to create a ; demand for them, even to the extent of fomenting international j illwill to create that demand. There is no sentiment or patriotism ; in the quest of filthy lucre.  The lure of profit is stronger than moralscruple, and so one of the most sinister forms of profiteering in the I pre-war days was that connected with the building of warships andIthe manufacture of implements of warfare.   The manufacture of armaments had become internationalised in the hands of Krupp&apos;s, Armstrongs, Schneider&apos;s, and other large combinations, all jointly concerned in the promotion of companies, seeking orders wherever they were to be found.   Their commercial expansion was a source of pride to their owners; Krupps boasted that the Essen factories, which employed 20,000 workmen in 1887 and now no doubt I employ tenfold that number or more sprang from a tiny forge manned by three men which Alfred Krupp acquired in 1848.   That I expansion was clue to the development of Bessemer steel in the [manufacture of big guns for any country which was prepared to pay for them.   The incentive of private profit must, therefore, be removed and armaments produced only in national workshops.Practical Steps.I am in favour of the Entente Powers taking the initial steps at once in the formation of a League of Nations. Hitherto there has been but vague talk, which has been variously interpreted.; j The question of sovereignty has not been fairly and squarely faced, and it is safe to say will never be fairly and squarely faced by those I in the seats of authority, unless urged by pressure of outside public Popinion. The man in the street is thinking far ahead of Foreign $Offices and Governments on these matters, and will at once assert [himself if the question begins really to be discussed through the &quot;public Press and platform in the form of concrete, practical pro-Jposals. &apos; The peoples are not going to be content with mere rinsings gof historical dustbins, but will insist on a scheme based on present
needs. We have lived through centuries of pre-war experience during the last four years, and we must act upon that experience while it is vivid in our minds.For that reason I want the League of Nations idea to be brought down from the Olympian heights of eloquent rhetoric to the piano of matter-of-fact, practical proposition.An Inteh-Allied Conference.To help in that direction, I should like to see an Inter-Allied Hague Conference arranged by the Entente Powers, at which there should be representation not only of Governments but of peoples. This war is unlike any previous war in that it is a war of peoples. Every-body is in it, more or less. It is, therefore, most essential that the Entente Governments should be at one with the peoples.The Government has been compelled to refuse passports for a meeting of an international character, including the enemy countries, and there is a good deal of soreness on the part of organised Labour as a consequence. I believe it would tend to improve relations between the Government and the people if an Inter-Allied Conference were held.I should like to see at such a Conference representatives of organised Labour, and religion, and commerce, drawn from America, France, Great Britain, Italy, and the allied countries generally. It would have a most excellent effect in bringing together those who are engaged in a common struggle. Incidentally, the Governments might at such a Conference revise peace aims and interest their peoples in them ; but the main purpose of the Conference would be to agree on practical steps in the initiation of a League of Nations to safeguard the future peace of the world.I feel sure that such a Conference would never bar out any country except one in actual state of warfare against the allied nations; but would leave the door open for any people who would subscribe to the conditions and give the necessary guarantees for their clue fulfilment.A declaration, to that effect, embodied in practical propositions for the initiation of a League Of Nations, could not fail to have a great moral effect in enemy countries, and might induce the German people to reconsider their position in the world and their relation to their present taskmasters.a confeuence agenda.What, then, are the conditions that might emerge from such a Conference arranged and more or less led by Entente Governments on terms of reference carefully prepared?I have put what presents itself to my mind as the full ultimate solution, namely, a League open to all, based upon an economic boycott and armed force, reduction of armaments, and suppression of private profit in their manufacture.
But to attain that I realise that we have a long way to go. How best can we make a start? I believe in building upon, as far as possible, the commitments of influential opinion already formed and on record.Concrete Proposals. The American delegation to the Hague Tribunal in 1907 put forward a proposition for the establishment of a standing court for the settlement of such cases of disputes between nations as could be settled by reference to existing laws or covenants.This proposal was afterwards endorsed by ex-President Taft and by the American League to Enforce Peace.1. That court might be formed. It would at least carry us a little way in the substitution of law for war in international adjustments. Its very existence and activities would familiarise us with the idea of reason against force. And, as it got to work, it would enlarge the sphere within which law would operate, because its decisions would form a sort of common law of nations.2. A Court of Conciliation to deal, with questions outside the scope of the judicial body. This would be a. sort of Confer-ence in situ, ready to be called together on occasions of international tension such as existed in July, 1914. It will be remembered that Sir Edward Grey laboured hard to get such a Conference formed in the fateful days immediately prior to the war, but he failed. If the composition of such a body had been previously agreed to the course of events might have been different. Germany might still, of course, have set the world at defiance even if she had been previously committed to submitting her case to an arbitrament of reason, but if she had been so committed, and if the Conference had been already agreed to in composition as well as in principle, the fact of her breaking out against obligations of honour would at least have been made patent to all the world. Italy and the United States would have joined forces with the Entente Powers at the outset,3. There could be agreement in the establishment of a Research Commission. It should, I think, include a lay as well as a legal element; but that would be matter for consideration. International jurists might formulate proposals for submission to the contracting countries, so as to make provision for the settlement of matters not at present covered by laws or covenants. But its main function would be to examine what had been proposed or attempted in the way of settlement of international differences, to advise on the causes of failure and on ways and means of surmounting such causes of failure in the future. I do not think that the historical analogy should be conclusive, but it has a bearing on the present considerations, and the very causes of past failure might be found to be non-existent in the light of present-day conditions.For instance, the more open diplomacy to which we are inevitably tending might be found to be in itself a solvent of difficulties which
have been insoluble in the past. In any case, the setting up of such a body by the Allied Powers now might prepare the way for the time when, I hope in the not distant future, the peace terms terminating the present war fall to be discussed.The body in question might, for instance, examine the ground of limitation of armaments from a practical point of view, having regard to length of frontiers, extent of dominions, wealth, population, and other conditions.4. The appointment of an Inter-Allied Commission to examine the ground in regard to :  (a) Territorial   readjustment   on   the   basis   of   nationalunities, and(b) Administration of backward areas on a trustee basis.It is the second question which may well be the cause of future trouble, unless agreement is readied in good time by Allied Govern-ments and people. The question is going to figure largely at the end of the war because immense areas have been conquered by Allied arms, and there is as yet no Allied agreement as to their disposition.The British people did not enter into the war for territory, and although much territory has fallen to us during the last four years, I believe that our main interest in it lies only in the safeguarding of sea routes, and the development of the reservoir of raw materials for the use of the world.Administration of Central Africa, for instance, might quite con-sistently with our interest be placed under trust by a League of Nations. The nations which have already got control might be held responsible to the League, provision being made in each case for the protection of peoples, and for preventing their being used as military forces for ulterior aims. These things are now &quot; in the air,&quot; and are a positive source of danger to Allied unity and world-peace. They might well be examined by a commission not pro-occupied with the prosecution of the war, and which could examine them with a single eye to future peace rather than to imperial expansion. And they should be examined now, and not left for Germany to make them causes of conflict between the Allies later on.Conclusions.I put forward these four propositions as a possible programme for a conference such as I have suggested. They might, of course, first be discussed by the Allied Governments, who would be represented at the conference, and who would still be responsible to their respec-tive peoples for any action which might be taken on them. What I am concerned about is the practical steps which might be taken now to secure a lasting peace and a League of Nations.The two are bound inseparably together.If the war is not rightly ended there can be neither one nor the other. And I feel sure that nothing could more contribute to a right end than cordial relations between Allied Governments and peoples,
In the. lack of it is a danger which must be faced. There is no use trying to shirk it, because that would only be to put it off till a less favourable opportunity.I believe the Allied peoples are eager for a League of Nations; I oelieve they would gladly co-operate with Governments in grappling with the practical difficulties.There are many other difficulties besides those which have been Ihere mentioned.There are, for instance, the different degrees to which nations are called upon to defend territories separated from them. There is the :laim on the part of nations for room to expand. There is the ques-ion of the British Navy. All these difficulties must be present to he mind of anyone who has given close attention to the question of he League of Nations. But the difficulties must be surmounted. .&apos;he alternative is too dreadful to contemplate. We are faced with a risis in world history. We must either go on to finer things in life br again sink to barbarism.Friends, in the opening sentences of my address I quoted from a peech of the German Kaiser. I want now in closing to quote from a peech of President Wilson.Just a week or two ago that great man put in a single sentence he objects for which all good men and women are striving.He said:  &quot; What we seek is the reign of law, based upon the consent of he governed and sustained by the organised opinion of mankind.&quot;The Kaiser and the President are as wide as the Poles apart; he one speaks for the past, the other for the future. We are now ravelling from one to the other The world is rolling freedom&apos;s way and ripening in her sorrow;ut as between Kaiserdom and freedom there is no halting-place, o halfway house, and no compromise.] We are going right on to a world unity of the nations, based pon mutual respect for law, for right, and for the claims of umanity.Printed and Published by the Co-operative Printing Society, Tudor Street, London, E.C. from whom further copies may be obtained, 6d. each.
