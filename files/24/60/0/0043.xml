(This Document is the Propertyk \      CONFERENCE OF ALLIED FOOD CONTROLLERS.^EHXllW MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER.&quot;-WIIIIH&quot;1. I desire to report&quot;to the War Cabinet that during therecent Conferences of Allied Food Controllers certain decisions were taken with a view to co-ordinating the food programmes of the Allied Countries and so providing one general food programme and eliminating competition   in purchase and transport.*2. The Food Controllers have formed themselves into an 11 LaterAllied Food Council&quot; and have established a &quot;Committee of Representatives&quot; consisting of two representatives of each Controller, with an independent Chairman, and certain additional members, to carry out the work o  the Council in accordance with the powers delegated to it by the Food Controllers.Appendix A is a copy *f the Agreement made by the Food Controllers, which sets out the constitution and functioha of the Food Council, and the Committee of Representatives.3,. The main results of the agreement are that the FoodControllers, through the Committee $f Representatives, have made themselves responsible;for securing a co-ordinated programme for all food imports to the Allies in Europe.    The programme -/Till be settled by the Committee on the basis of the needs and resources of each Country subject to the&apos; limitations of finance, available shipping and supplies.   Instead, therefore, of separate programmes being put forward independently by different Countries and for different classes of foodstuffs, which compete among themselves for tonnage and finance, one complete programme will be arrived at which will take into account all the necessary factors.     It will be the duty of the Committee to secure that the programme is carried into effect.
It is intended that the various executives which are now in existence shall continue their functions of preparing the programmes for the principal foodstuffs, hut their work will he subject to the direction of the Committee of Representatives,I attach for tho information of the War Cabinet (Appendix B) a copy of the Resolutions passed by the Pood Controllers.In connection with the system of purchase an important reform has been decided on,    As will be seen from Resolution 8 it has been agreed that the purchase of all food commodities in North America should be unified under the direction of . Sir Guy aranet,I would draw special attention to the resolutions passed by the Conference on the subject of the milling of wheat.    As far as practicable it is proposed that one standard of wheat extraction (80$) should be established throughout the four Allied Countries and future programmes of requirements will be made up on that basis. It may be mentioned that a considerably higher ratio of extraction recently prevailed in this Country,It will be observed that the Conference was strongly opposed to the rationing of bread.Finally I would draw attention to the resolution  No. 2 passed by the Conference on the subject of railway material, This appears to be a matter calling for early consideration by the War Cabinet,J, R, CLYNES,MINISTRY OF FOOD,7th August, 1918,
APPENDIX A.AGREEMENT AS TO INTER-ALLIED POOD CONTROL.1. The Pood Controllers of Great Britain, Prance, Italyand the United States having met together to examine their respective requirements of food in   relation to the supplies available, are of opinion that the time has now arrived when further steps should be taken to co-ordinate tho food programme of each of the Allied Countries in the light of:-(a) Their import necessities^(b) tonnage available,(c) finance, and(d) elimination of competition in purchase andtransport.2, The aim of such co-ordination should be to preservea proper balance between the needs of the Allied countries not only in respect of single commodities or groups of commodities as has hitherto been the case, but in regard to their food supplies as a whole and to secure tho purchase and transport of overseas supplies.3. They have therefore agreed, subject to the approval oftheir respective Governments, upon tho formation of an Inter-Allied Pood Council which shall be composed of the Pood Controllers of the four Allied Countries above-mentioned, which shall meet every three months, or as often as may be necessary, and shall within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the respective Governments agree upon a programme and method of food imports embracing the needs of all the allied countries and determine questions of common interest and policy.v
They have further1 agreed that the four Pood Controllers should appoint two representatives each to form a body called the 11 Inter-Allied Pood Council Commit too of Representatives&quot;; having its headquarters in London,Tho Committee of representatives shall, with the approval of the Pood Council, elect an independent Chairman, from outside their own number:, who shall have no vote.The Allied Maritime Transport Council, the Inter-Allied Finance Council, and the Inter-Allied Scientific Commission will each be asked to appoint a delegate to assist the Com-mittee of Representatives.     When the Committee of Repre-sentatives finds that the Interests of other countries are involved they may invite representatives of these countries to attend.The functions of the Committee of Representatives shall be, subject&apos;to tho direction of their Pood Controllers, to secure and to co-ordinate the programmes of the various food executives (specified below) dealing with particular classes of food-stuffs, and   to consolidate these programmes Into a general food programme for all foods and all allied countries; to act as the sole channel of communication as to general policy between these executives and the Allied Maritime Transport Council and the Inter-Allied Finance Council, to adjust the food programme from time to time according to circumstances; to supervise and ensure the purchase and shipping programme and to generally carry on the work of the Council in accordance with the powers delegated to it by the respective Pood Controllers,
The following committees or executives are set up or continued:-A,    Wheat Executive.5V    Meat &amp; Pats - Executive.,C, Sugar Programme Committee,D. Oil-Seed Programme Committee,and such other Committee a as may become/necessary from time to time.These Executives and Committees shall from time to time formulate programmes for the equitable provision and distribution of imports among the different countries&apos;and shall co-operate in directing the execution of such programmes, subject to the policy set out by the Pood Controllers through the Com-mittee of Representatives.    These Executives and Committees are to be constituted of equal numbers of representatives from England, Prance, Italy and the United States,Confirmed,.   J, R , Clynes, Ve. Boret.

APPENDIX   B. RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE FOOD CONTROLLERSTrie Foo&apos;d uouncil hortioy oonrirs&apos;.s the principle irrficn was accepted by the United Kingdom, France and Italy, in November last, that the minimum requirements of Food must have priority in the general allocation of tonnage. (26th July)The question of railway trucks and other facilities is of primary importance for securing tho proper home distribution of supplies.The quantity of railway material now taken up for military purposes in each of the Allied Countries is so great and is so constantly on the increase, that the number of locomotives and trucks left for the carriage of civilian supplies has gradually sunk to such a dangerous level that economic life Is actually threatened with paralysis in some quarters.     This would be bound, In the long run, to paralyse military operations.The Food Council therefore calls the attention of the   Allied Governments to the necessity of;(l) Facilitating the contruction of railway material in all Allied Countries by allocating a greater number of men and a larger quantity of material for this purpose;(2) Allocating tonnage for the immediate transport of trucks and locomotives in all countries where they arc urgently needed;(3) The adequate provision of finance foi the purpose.(26th July) Resolved that while the increased production of the United States renders it possible to relax some of the restrictions which have borne with peculiar hardship upon all our peoples, yet it is absolutely necessary that rigid economy and elimination of waste in the consumption and handling of all foodstuffs, as well as increased production, should be maintained throughout the European Allied countries and in North America.It is only by such economy and elimination of waste that the transportation of the nocossary men and supplies from North
America to the European Front can he accomplished, and that stocks of foodstuffs can be built up in North America as an inouranco against the aror-prescnt danger of harvest failure and the possible necessity for large emergency drafts to Europe.fto cannot admii/stor the food problem on the basis of one year13 war-; wo must prepare for its long continuance if we are to ensure absolute victory. (26 July) (4)       Resolved that Sir John Boale be requested to take the office of independent Chairman of the Committee of Representatives to serve at the pleasure of the Inter-Allied Food Council, it being understood that Sir John Beale will resign as British Representative upon the Wheat Executive. (29 July) (5)       Resolved that tho Committee of Representatives he instructed to at once engage iffice quarters and the Shipping, Secretarial, and Statistical assistance necessary for the execution of the primary memorandum, it being agreed that the four Governments shall each undertake to pay one-quarter of tho expense involved ponding any further arrangement. (29 July) (6)       Resolvod that tho Committee cf Representatives should formulate-, not less than once monthly, a statistical statement showing as nearly as may be the stocks of the principal food commodities in England, Franco, Italy and tho United States., together with the arrivals of foodstuffs, with a monthly comparison cf theso arrivals with the programmes that may be agreed upon.   This Information to he for circulation to tho various Food Controllers and such othor agenciea as may bo indicated confidentially% (29 July)i(7)       Resolved that the proscnt Intention of the Resolution providingI - &quot;for a uniform bread throughout the four countries on the basis of 80$ wheat products and 20% other consuls is that the broad should actually bo dilutod to tho extent of 20^ with such cereals or in part an 1    increasod percentage of milling.   The Broad dilution to bo irrespective !    cf other cereals in the dioti (29 July)
i    Resolved that the Committee of hepresontatives should engage Sirly Granet to proceed to tho United States to tako charge and re-organiso1l? purchase af North Amorlean Food commodities on behalf of tho Europeanlliea, such re-organisation to be carried out In co-operation with thejilted States   Food Administration, the Canadian Food authorities, andlie high Commissioners of the various Allied Governments. (29 July).In the opinion of the Food Council the development of the variousjimmodity import programmes by the Committee of ^epresont&amp;tives   shouldh based upon the following priorities:-(1) Broad-Grains - Civilian and Army. (2) Army Supplies (Meat, Fodder, etc) ; (3) Civilian Meals and Fats. (4) Feeds for ^airy Cattle.    &quot; I (5) Civilian Cereal Diet outside. Bread.The relative position of tho following groups is loft for further jlscussion:-      - ...Feeds for draught animals.&apos;Civilian Comestibles (Sugar, Coffee, Tea, Dried Fruits.)Industrial uses of grain. Feeds for Meat animals.lie letter of the Allied Maritime Transport Council of to-day (urging thathe Food Import Programme should be en the basis of last yoar!a Imports,FoodjiBfi increase of production) having been laid before tho/Counoil, the kmc11 wishes to stato that while it agrees with the absolute necessity minimum use of tonnage and has In itself been created for this purpose,ii i the basis of calculation en imports to England, France and Italy uponio foundation of last year V imports, less increase of production, simply I ......Uns a repetition of tho food difficulties of last year.   We wish to stateiphatically that the morals of the people will be most seriously endanger-.1 by such a basis of Imports.   Tho Food Council      put3 forward as a moreinstructive basis the employment of tho same ship ton mileage during theffiiing year. (30 July)i the matter of broad-grains it is considered imperative th-;t such supolios iall be provided as will permit of broad distribution without rationing, i is considered however fundamentally necessary to maintain actual dilution i the bread to tho extent that, based on 8C,i milling of wheat, 20% of hor cereal diluents should be added to the bread.   If the milling ratio i any given country should excood &amp;Q%, then the proportion of diluents &apos;y bo ryducod accordingly.&apos; (30 July)
