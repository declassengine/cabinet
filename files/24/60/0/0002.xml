Confidential.Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office........________^MHEK1,777 ahX^^-Russia/011.MEMORANDUM.POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE UKRAINE.Two startling &quot;bits of news from Kiev - the assassination of Field-Marshal von Eichhorn and the arrival of Milyukov - make it important to review the development of the political situation in &quot;the Ukraine during the last few months.The German troops arrived in Kiev in the first days of April and were accompanied by the remnants of the Rada which, after the arriv.&quot;l of the Bolsheviks in Kiev in M-.rch, lu;d t;\ken refuge in Zhitomir.   Vinnichenko, the former Prime Minister of the Ukraine, hc;d disappeared during the Bolshevik regime end r, new Ukrainian Government wc^s entrusted to Golubovich, a young Ukrainian Social Revolutionary only 24 years of age who had been a member of Vinnichenko1s former Cabinet.   The new Government was chiefly composed of Ukrainian Social Revolutionaries who favoured a drastic programme of agrarian reform.   This Government was unable to exercise any real authority even in Kiev, much less in the provinces, and the German military authorities soon became exasperated with its incompetence and with its failure to persuade the peasants to part with their food.    Eichhorn, the German Military Commander-in-Chief, lost patience with ttee Rada and proceeded on his own initiative to issue an Order to the peasants ordering them to loso no time in sowing their fields, and threatening them otherwise with the Introduction of German colonists who would take their land from them.   This proclamation was posted up in the streets of Kiev and Immediately caused a great uproar in Ukrainian Nationalist circles.     The Rada protested, and Golubovich visited Baron von Kumm, the German diplomatic representative *in ,Kiev, but failed-to&apos;get any satisfaction.    Golubovich assured Mumm that the present Government
was only temporary and would hand over Its powers to the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly which was to meet in Kiev on May 12.     This Constituent Assembly would elect a new Government based on wide-spread popular support which would observe the terms of the Brest Peace and would endeavour to work in friendly accord with the German Government.   Baron von Kumm curtly dismissed Golubovich&apos;s assurances with the abrupt answer that they had come too late. Meanwhile a ccPup d&apos;etat in Kiev was being engineered by the German military authorities.   On April 29 there was a meeting in Kiev of a number of large peasant proprietors who denounced the Rada and proclaimed Skoropadski as Hetman of the Ukraine. At the same time German officers entered the building where the Rada was sitting and dispersed the meeting, arresting some of the leaders.Skoropadski proceeded to form a new Government under German auspices.   For some time he had considerable difficulty in finding a set of men who would enter his Government, and the first list, consisting chiefly of Cadets and Octobrists, caused great dissatisfaction amongst the Ukrainian Nationalists in Kiev. In addition to this, his first statements of policy seemed to show that he was relying almost entirely on the German military party and on the big land-owners.   Protests were immediately made by the peasant proprietors, who had originally been in favour of Skoropadski1s appointment.   After some time Skoropadski yielded to their pressure and made overtures to the Ukrainian Nationalist parties.   Now that the Ukrainian Social Revolutionary party, which had formed the backbone of the late Rada Government which had been dispersed, was discredited, the leading role amongst the Nationalist parties was played by the so-called Social Federalist party, the leaders of which were Doroshenko, Yefremov and Shulgin ( a cousin of the Shulgin who has remained a violent anti-Ukrainian and Russian Nationalist aid has repudiated all offers from the Germans).
pie Ukrainian Nationalist parties, headed by the Social Federalist party, laid a number of conditions before Skoropadski which were not accepted by him, with the result that they declined to have anything to do with his Government.    Doroshenko then proceeded to act on his own initiative and resigned from the Social Federalist party,     Shortly afterwards he approached Skoropadski and agreed to enter his Government, accepting the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs.   Since Doroshenko^ appointment Skoropadski, no doubt encouraged by the German Foreign Office, has been showing further favours to the Ukrainian Nationalist groups in Kiev;   for example, he has issued orders that all officials in the Ukraine who do not speak Ukrainian are to be dismissed.    This change in Skoropadski&apos;a policy has continued steadily during the last six weeks, and practically all the Ukrainian Nationalist parties are content to throw in their lot with Skoropadski on the basis of the complete independence of the Ukraine.The German Government appears to be doing its best to go back on the high-handed action of its military representative in Kiev and to be conciliating the Liberal and Moderate Socialist elements in the Ukraine,   For some time there was a strong difference of opinion in Germany as to the best policy to be pursued.   The military party were inclined to coquet with the Russian reactionaries and monarchists who had come to Kiev from Hussia, hoping that the coup dfetat in the Ukraine was to prove a stepping-sttne to the re-establishment of the Monarchy in Russia.   There is no doubt that German agents both in the Ukraine and in Moscow and Petrograd approached various influential Russians in this direction, but apparently the failure of the Cadet party in Moscow to respond and the enormous difficulties of reotoring order throughout Russia induced the German Government to renounce a monarchical policy md to return to the policy of Brest-LHovsk of conciliating Ukrainian Nationalism and maintaining
11X 14.peace with the Bolsheviks in Moscow.Meanwhile in Kiev a striking change of front had been shown by the Cadet party.   Before the arrival of the Germans in April, the Cadet party in tho Ukraine had held out strongly against the idea of Ukrainian independence and had denounced the Ukrainian Nationalist Movement as a mere Austrian intrigue.    After the formation of the Skoropadski Government the Cadets in Kiev held an important Congress at which they decided to go back on their old federal policy and take their stand on the basis of the complete independence of the Ukraine.     Vasilenko, one of the leaders of the Ukrainian Cadets, made the following statement: &quot;Ukrainian culture will have to enter upon a struggle with Russian culture which will facilitate its development.   The Ukraine can and must be organised as an independent State.   The fact that we rely upon foreign bayonets is neither dangerous nor abnormal, as is shown by the example of Bulgaria who organised hersear under the protection of the Russian Army.   If these foreign forces quitted the Ukraine a.t the present moment, it would be the Bolsheviks who would return and continue to bring destruction and trouble amongst the population&quot;.      Ryepetski, another leading Cadet who has also joined Skoropadski1s Government as Minister of Finance, explained the necessity for complete separation from Russia for financial reasons:-   &quot;The ruinous finance of the Bolsheviks would saddle Russia with a debt which it would be impossible to redeem in the future and for which the Ukraine should accept no responsibility&quot;.It was after the Cadet party in the Ukraine had come to this decision to accept the programme of Ukrainian independence and to break off direct relations with the Cadet party in Moscow that Milyukov arrived in Kiev.     It seems probable that Kilyukov, who had ,been for some time in chiding in the Northern Caucasus and
who had afterwards travelled through the Crimea, had come to the conclusion that the best hope for Russia in the future was a constitutional monarchy protected by the Germans.   He appears to have hoped that Skoropadskifs Government in the Ukraine, of which the leading Ukrainian Cadets were members, would be used by the Germans as a stepping -sibone to a great federal Russia. It was on this basis that he seems to have negotiated both with the Germans and the Cadets in Kiev, but, according to the meagre reports which have reached this country partly from German, partly from Ukrainian sources, he appears to have met with no success, and is now being kept under police surveillance with a view to his expulsion from Kiev.     If these reports about Milyukov are correct, his failure in Kiev is not surprising. The Ukrainian Cadets in Skoropadski&apos;s Government must rely entirely upon German support, and if German policy is at present opposed to the restoration of a federal Russia, they could not possibly agree to Milyukovfs proposals.   Milyukov, in making such a change of front, can only have been actuated by what he considers the only possibility for Russia in the future. He has always stood for Russian unity and has been violently opposed to the separatist programme of the Ukraine.   It would be difficult for him to believe that the Cadets in the Ukraine, who in this respect had entirely Shared his views, could abandon suddenly the most fundamental item in their programme.     Milyukov, even if at the last moment he has despaired of support from the Allies and has made up his mind to seek it from Germany, has been far more consistent in his political outlook than his former colleagues in Kiev.    Until more complete news reaches us regarding the actual motives which prompted Milyukov in going to Kiev, it is hardly fair to condemn him unheard.   But if he has despaired of help from the Allies, while the main body of his party in Moscow has resolutely held out against all overtures from the Germans,
4 &quot;&quot;5fne will have completely discredited himself with all parties in Russia.Since the coup d&apos;etat, which led to the formation of Skoropadski&apos;s Government, we have heard practically nothing of Eichhorn&apos;s activities in Kiev.    Whatever his policy may have been, he seems to have been recently over-ridden by the German foreign Office which has insisted on conciliating the Ukrainian Nationalists, but the attitude of the German military authorities both in Kiev and in the provinces has been the chief reason of the difficulties that the Germans have met with amongst the peasants.     Little or no attention has been paid in the villages to the edicts of the Central Government in Kiev, and so long as the German military authorities continued their high-handed action of seizing good from the peasants, there was .no hope of a con-cillatory policy in Kiev meeting with any real success.   There have been armed risings by the ^asants in almost every village and constant strikes, especially on the railways, which the Ukrainian Government has been unable to cope with.In these circumstances the assassination of Eichhorn is not surprising.   If it has been carried out by the Social Revolutionaries it is meant as a protest against the policy of the German military authorities who have been trying to seize the food from the peasants.   But it will not necessarily lead to reprisals on the part of the German Government;   on the contrary, it may serve as an additional argument for the German Foreign Office in insisting on their policy of conciliation in the Ukraine. Apart from this consideration, however, it will be an enormous embarrassment to the German Government, as once this policy of political assassination begins, there is no knowing where it may end,  end it may incite the peasants to take similar action against less important officials and German soldiers.1.8.18. ....................
