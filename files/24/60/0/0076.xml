I wish to endorse with all possible emphasis the views set forth in the above-mentioned memorandum, also the recommendations made by Admiral Sir Edmond Slade in his paper on the Petroleum situation in the British Empire, to Which the First Sea Lord refers.The whole future of air power is dependent upon adequate supplies of liquid fuel,   No other form of fuel is as yet in view.   Air power is still in its infancy. * Its development as a striking force is just beginning.&apos;Air force will in the near future be the first line of offence and defence.   Air warfare will clear the way for sea warfare and land warfare,   I do not think that it is an over-statement to say that the very existence of the Empire will depend in the first instance upon aerial supremacy.Admiral blade has shewn clearly in his paper that in Persia and Mesopotamia lie the largest undeveloped resources of liquid fuel in the world.   In view of the paramount importance of liquid fuel, both to the Eoyal Air Force and to the Uavy, it is essential that stops shall be taken to monopolise all possible supplies of petroleum and kindred oils,   Further, the areas in which it is contained must be safeguarded by a very wide bolt of territory between it and potential enemies,(Signed).
