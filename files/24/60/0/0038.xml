JPQJr: THE Di^RISiijIiT Off OYERStiAa TRAM.Memorandum by Sir A,Steel-Maitland. v.Lord R, Cecil,with covering note bysir H. Sankey.I venture to hope that the following matter may receive the early attention of the V.&apos;ar Cabinet,     It is very urgent.The following minute was submitted to the v7ar Cabinet on 28th June (paper Gr,T* 4921)&quot;The Department of overseas Trade which was created in the autumn of 1917 as a Joint Department of the Board of Trade and the foreign Office is at present housed in buildings in Basinghall Street previously occupied by the q1&amp; Board of Trade Commercial Intelligence Department which was incorporated in the Department of Overseas Trade. The work of the Department is so intimately bound up with that of the parent departments and in particular of the foreign Office, that inefficiency and the risk of serious mistakes are caused by the separation,    Mich delay and inconvenience is also created.    The Office of Works have undertaken to erect immediately, buildings on the Horse Guards1 Parade to accommodate the staff provided the sanction of the Yiar Cabinet is obtained, and this is now urgently requested,n    The number of the staff for whom provision is needed is 250.-The .ar Cabinet sanctioned the proposal subject to the approval of the Var Priorities Committee, \.-ho in turn approved it subject to the consent of the tforks Construction Sub-Committee,-    The latter, however, on the ground of shortage of labour and of building material have declined to give their approval.In view of the extreme urgency of the matter it is desired that the War Cabinet reouest the &quot;:orks Construction Sub-Committee to reconsider their decision.(Signed).
