Others, notably thes in paragraph 5 on Bomhinp. are perhaps t for the reasons -stated hsiow, themselves an involuntary&apos; reflection of Germaa propaganda. * Again it is possible that the comment in paragraph 1 is an echo&apos; of &quot;old controversies thrashed out in the press many 1 months ago when training methods were as yet in their infancy.But to deal seriatim with the points raised,, -PARASBA?As regards paragraph 1, the training of British pilots in not considered inadequate.    SJhe period of training- is now of nine to twelve months&apos; duration;   that is to say a Cadet who joins? the in January will not &quot;be ready to proceed overseas as.,afinished pilot before the following September at earliest.    An. indication of.the extent to which training has &quot;been extended and improved may be gathered from the&apos;fact that the average number of hours of solo flying carried out by pupils before obtaining their * pilot3a wings has risen from       hours&quot;in May 1917 to       hours in May 1918,    $hare is no doubt that in every respect our general $n&amp; specialised training is superior to that of the French, as is proved by the surest criterion - the results achieved.    Our schools of Aerial Gunnery, and the Wireless and Observers School supply typical instances*    An artillery pilot on joining a Corps Squadron in-France is able to carry out a thoroughly successful shoot In co-operation with the Artillery as soon as he has learnt the Ire of the lend;   this is an extremely difficult operation and .speaks volumes for the thorough training which pilots receive.The following figures show the results obtained on the Eastern Front by the-Royal Air J?oroe during the months of May and JaneEnemy aircraft brought down or drivendown out of control   . *,     , 0 * *,*    1089Kite Balloons destroyed *.*    ; 26Weight of bombs dropped, in tons,      *.*    ***    IG^lflumber of hours flora      ...     ...     ...     ,.*189f328

It has, however, been found impossible to procure the necessary figures from the French authorities without considerable further delay, since they are not at present available.
We have definite information that the German training is narrower in scope, less systematic and of considerably shorter duration than our own, a fact which undoubtedly accounts for their heavier proportionate casualties.The majority of German pilots ore M.0.0fa, the numbers of whom are steadily increasing,    Their moral and cepabili-ties compare very unfavourably with their own officer pilots and more unfavourably still with the pilots of the Koyal Air Force;   they lack the sense of responsibility and duty which is inherent in the British pilot and which is to a very great extent engendered by his training,:AG;R4PB 2. While it is true that the overage individual who enters&quot;&quot;the Air force is in all probability comparatively ignorant of geography and entirely ignorant of map-reading, every endeavour is made, from the beginning, to the end of his train- -ing to make good these deficiencies.    Moreover, cross-country flying forms today an important part of every flying officer&apos;a education.All the belligerents, however, suffer equally as regards the inevitable deterioration of the quality of their personnel, which has resulted after nearly 4 years of war. Our adversaries in this respect are admittedly in far worse case than ourselves as is evidenced, e.g. by the employment in the German Air Service of IJ.C.Q. Observers, owing to the shortage of officers.Occasional mistakes and, as a consequence, the bombing of a wrong objective are unavoidable, especially at night and on the part of pilots new to the front.    The enemy has the same difficulties and makes the same mistakes with even greater frequenoy.I IRA GRAPH g. The importance of reconnaissance work is fully realised?,% It is regarded as a matter for specialisation and it isexpressly to this end that the Branch Intelligence Sections with Corps Squadrons and Army Wings were created.    These organisations belong to, and are controlled by, the Army,Possibly the criticism in the paragraph under review may take its origin from the fact that our fighting largely outnumber our reconnaissance squadrons.    This is due, above all, to the realisation of the value of reconnaissance.   The l primary function of our fighters is to protect our reeonnais-sanca squadrons and, conversely, to harry those of the enemy.The weather factor plays an important part in reoonnaissance, end taking this factor into consideration, there have been no occasions when it has been possible.to supply accurate information on which it has not been forth-coming.    Whenever it is humanly possible to fly, our machines keep the whole of the British Front under observation through-out the 24 hours, as a result of which, despite the numerous artifices adopted by the enemy to deceive the reconnaissance pilot, no instances can be produoed in which the British General Staff has been taken by surprise;   the same, however, cannot be said of the French.As regards night reconnaissance, this type of reoona-aissance has of course its limitations.    Every endeavour is being made, however, to surmount the inherent difficulties ef this work by the use of parachute flares etc and in this respect we are certainly ahead of the enemy.
lIliGBJJ?! 5.All available information disproves the assertion the  erases make better use of smaller forces, anei are superior in air atrate$y.    In tactics;, low flyingI for example, they have been content to follow our lead 80 far 88 their resources admit.    Further, the bulk of our air work is carried out on the German side of the battle front, and though the enemy shows considerable initiative on occasion his tondenoy la still to confine himself to hie own. lines.Our reports and comparative figures show very cles: that the air work carried out from Dunkirk, although eacoellent, is not in any direction superior to.ths? of rsmaiaadsr of the Boy el Air Force,,&amp; comment seema to overlook the fact that bomb raids are carried out for moral, as well as for material effect * The latter is &quot;beat secured by concentration, 1 -former by dispersion of effort, and reports from German Bourses $how the extremely demoralising effect produced troops, particularly on those purposely dispersed by th? enemy over wide areas in rest billets.Any limitation  of our objectives would inevitably simplify the problem of defence ( including retaliatory raids) for the enemy, ewa diminish the very heavy drain his available resources from which, under present oondli end thanks to our marked aerial superiority he now suffe?a;It is undeniable that the enemy utilises all poseic material for propaganda with considerable skill.Bombing in occupied Belgium is, however, oonfined t objectives of Have! and Military importance, and cent1m anoe of raids on these objectives is essential to the success of our operations both by lend and sea. Attent is drawn to War Cabinet paper G,2.4946 of June  5th, 191 in which this aspect of the question is dealt with at greater lengths(signed)   F, H. QYUB &quot;Ma jor-General.
