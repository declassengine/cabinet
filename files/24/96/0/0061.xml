Afghanistan. Whole question has been very carefully reconsidered in light of your further representations. Viewof His Majesty&apos;s Government is that while, as before stated, they desire resumption of friendly relations with Afghanistan, they are not prepared, in order to gain thisobject, to take steps that would be misconstrued as weakness. They are of opinion,in these circumstances, that it will suffice at present juncture to warn him that we arenot satisfied with his conduct since Pindi Treaty, to intimate that we are prepared todiscuss misunderstandings, and, if this offer is not accepted, to do nothing furtheruntil he formally notifies intention to send mission referred to at end of your telegram.For this purpose letter to Amir might follow language of draft embodied in yourtelegram 13 S. of 5th January down to and including words. &quot; full and frankdiscussion by word of mouth.&quot; Then omit next four sentences and conclude as indraft from words &quot;discussion such as I have suggested,&quot; to end, Your letter shouldmake it plain beyond doubt that the discussion does not represent second stage of negotiations as provided for in Article IV. of Treaty. Subject to any furtherobservations you may have to offer, you may address Amir accordingly.
