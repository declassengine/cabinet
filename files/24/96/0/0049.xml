This Vozir&apos;-&apos;^ O Vii Property -Qf,f) 0 u\l KHtnn/tic t^lso^ Government, jgjFrom Secretary of State to Viceroy, 1th January 1920.Clear the line.Foreign Secret. Your telegrams of 5tli January Nos. 12 and 13 S. Afghanistan.I agree that no reply need be sent at present to Amir&apos;s letter to the King.As regards your own letter to Amir, 1 agree with you that opportunity should betaken to tax Amir with his failure to carry out proviso (of) Article 4 of RawalpindiTreaty. Terms of first part of your draft letter have my entire approval, but I feeldoubtful as to the latter part and particularly as to proposal to invite Amir to visitIndia. I fully agree that treaty of iriendhip with Afghanistan, if attainable, would beof great advantage to us. But would that object be furthered by proposed invitation,and if not, might not it be dangerous to express our desire for friendship ? I shouldbe afraid that however plain it is made to Amir that invitation is quite distinct frommission contemplated in Article 4 of Treaty, he will see in it a departure frompolicy of treaty which he will ascribe not to magnanimity but to fear. Have youconsidered what attitude is to be adopted in the possible event of Amir declininginvitation, both on his own account and. that of Taiijzi. It seems important to providefor this contingency before deciding upon action to be taken.There is doubtless, advantage in inviting Amir to explain why, it he reallydesires friendship with us as he says, he has failed to satisfy our tests. But I take itreal explanation of his conduct is that he is playing oil Bolsheviks against ourselves,and if this is so, question that arises for us seems to be whether we can hold outinducements to him that will suffice to turn the scale in our favour and againstBolsheviks. Any such inducement could, of course, only be offered upon conditionof Amir&apos;s good behaviour.Please consider the matter further in the light of above remarks and let me knowyour views, particularly as to the possible inducements to the Amir. Meantime, no reply to his letter should issue.
