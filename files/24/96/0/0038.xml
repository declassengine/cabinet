SOCKET. &amp;ADMIRALTY VIEWS OH SITUATION IN CASPIAN SEA.andum for the Wwr Cabinot by the First Lord of the Admiralty.n aocount of the failure of General Denekln, thothe Bolsheviks on Persia and thence on India hasimminent2,   The Viceroy of India, the Commandor-in-Chief, InJJfithe British High Commissioner in the Cauoasus and the british minister at Teheran have stated that the command oi the Caspianis the deciding faotor0 &apos; If the command of the Caspian is given up. it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible   toreoover it.   Failure to realise the urgency of the matter canbut eventually lead to embarrassments in the future and inwhich the Navy will be called upon to assist in removing; and ifwe are morally bound to assist Persia in maintaining the        (integrity of her frontiers, one of the most vulnerable is thax.of the Caspian littoral and Trans-Caspia, which are directlydominated by that power which has oommand of the Caspian.In addition, the importance of the direot results to mesopotamia and her oil fields cannot be too strongly emphasised3o   If the Bolsheviks obtain command of the Caspian, thelarge stocks of oil fuel accumulated at G-roznl, Petrovsk andBaku, amounting to over 4,000,000 tons will fall into their hands.   This oil, by utilising river and sea transport thussaving railways , will resuscitate all industries throughoutRussia and will thus give inore^sed power for production of warmaterial to oarry on their war against civilisation0   Thiswould give a new lease of life to the Bolshevik Baltiosquadrons, etc, and may neoessltate renewed operations next spring by the British in order to maintain Baltio trade,Large stocks of cotton in Trans-Caspia which are now with difficulty transported by railway via Orenburg, will be made more easy of aooess.4.   It appears probable that the Bolsheviks will effeota military concentration at Samara for occupation of Trans-Caspia with eventual penetration to Persia and via Afghanistanto India,   Their transport will be greatly facilitated andaccelerated by the use of Volga transport to Astrakhan and by sea to KraBnovodsk, thence by rail to Merv and Tashkent,Also the northern read to Teheran would praotically be open,any movement in this direction would destroy British prestige in Persia, where our commitments necessitate that this should always be maintained.     The moral effeot on Persia would beoverwhelming.,5.   Russian railways are in a very deplorable state soit is very certain that full advantage would be token of thepossibilities of river and sea transport.   Reports to hard statethat the Bolsheviks have promised Afghanistan the districts ofKushk, Merv and Khorassan in return for their assistance; theBolsheviks to obtain this assistance play upon their Asiatioorigin to form a brotherhood against assumed European penetration,6.   Russia in the past always considered it essential to dominate the Persian littoral, a position we wish to break andwhich has been started by transferring the &quot;Pereboinnia&quot; to persia under the Persian flag.7.   The command of the Caspian means the domination ofCaucasus Republios and holding of ooastal ports (BakuPetrovsk, etc), *^
and thus again isolating Persia through holding the essentiallines of oommuhlOatlon via the Black sea, etc. whioh, is our only means of heavy transport to Persia, v8.   The command of the Caspian would also greatlirfaoilitate the supply of v/ar material of all description, to afghanistan for use against India as pointed out inparagraph 3*    We have secret and reliable information 4hatartillery and munitions have already been prepared for transport to Afghanistan.    Previous to 1914 small amountswhioh filtered through the Persian Gulf past our Naval,Patrol embarrassed the Indian Government, therefore hoW muohmore will this direct supply affect them?.Under these circumstances, if it, is considered essential that the command of the Caspian should remain inout handBt or in the hands of those who are friendly to us,it is pointed out that this will involve the oooupation ofBaku, whioh entails operations by the military on a ,considerable soale,The alternative plan whioh has been suggested ofoocupying the Persian Coast Towns of Enzeli and Ashuitada andconstructing passive land and sea defences backed Up by quasipassive alroraft defence is considered undesirable as it iswrong in principle and Would probably entail in the long run the same military force as required for the oooupation ofBaku.Ifi however, the vessels of Derakin&apos;s Fleet are taken over, re-armed with long range gunsjand manned byBritish naval personnel, with Baku suitably defended, in our occupation as a naval base, it is considered that the navaloommand of the Caspian Can be disputed against ^the Bolshevikswith prospect of success, evert should they re-lnfotfoe their -Flotillas on the Volga and at Astrakhan by ships from theBaltic.Time, however, is everythingt and if. anything is tobe Buboesefully done an immediate decision is essential.(initialled) wi H.
