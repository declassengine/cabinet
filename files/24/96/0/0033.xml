January 9Th,19 0.That this masting welcomes the principle of standardisation--tien of railway work &quot;by tho elimination of a large number ofgrades and accept, subject to tho removal of anomalies in-the groups of Grades as shown in the Schedule submitted to thisCongress.That this Meeting approves of the principle of standardi-sation of railwaymans wages, but rejects the proposals sub-mi tted to us because of the basis of existing average wages * Weinstruct the Executive Committee to enter into negotiationswith the Government for standardise? mages based on the highestrate of wages plus war wage in each grade ooncorned.This Conference decides to rejoct the principle of asliding scale based on tho cost of living because the cost ofliving whilst being a very important factor is not the onlyfactor on which wages should be fired, and would tend to stereo-pf typo tho present standard of comfort and would further prevent any improvement being obtained no matter how the productiveforces, of society may be improved.This Congress decides that any increment accruing under thepresent wages negotiations shall operate as-from August 18th,1919..
Thi3 Congress, after oarcful consideration of the Govern-raenfs proposals, re&amp;Tt ts that a vary large number of our raem-bers art) excluded, &amp;nti demand that negotiations shall be openedfor those grades at once.We further request that a. reply from the Government besubmitted tb this Mooting which will remain in Session pendingtheir reply on the resolutions previously adopted dealing withthe grades for v/hora offers, hayo been made, and that whateversettlement is arrived at/8$ama&amp;a applicable to Irish Railwaymanin corresponding grades.
10th. JanuarXrJL9SO*Dear SirjI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of9th.. January, conveying certain Resolutions passed at a specialGeneral Meeting of the National Union of Railwayman an that day.I have carefully considered the terms of the Resolut-ions and I observe that in effect your Delegates, have thrownover the results of all the negotiations of the past months, andthat they now revert to the utmost limit of the demands whichthey put forward in the early part of last year.As you are aware, the Government decided that these,demands could not, in the national interest, be conceded, andthe result of our negotiations since the recent strike has beenthat the accredited representatives of your Union were able torecommend the Governments proposals to your members for accept-ance.The terms of the Resolutions now sent to me conflictfundamentally with the arrangements at which we arrived.    Theyinvolve matters of national importance affecting every sectionof the community.     In these circumstances it is plain that until], the Cabinet has again considered  .      the issues which theyraise it is impossible for ffie to give you an authoritativereply.I shall, however, t*tain a meeting of my colleagues atthe earliest possible moment and will then communicate to youan answer which will carry with it the sanction&apos; of the GovernmentI hope to be able to do this in the early part of next week..1 note that you do not ask for any opportunity of explaining the reasons upon which these Resolutions were based,find I infer that no new considerations have arisen as a resultof which you would desire an intorvi-i:; with me0     If, however,there are any such new considerations which your Delegates wishto adduce,- I am open to receive these in any form which theythink proper and will place them before the Government,.(Sgd) ERIC GKDDES.gj Whitehall Gardens, S.W.&quot;January l&quot;Oth&apos;..- 1920*REPLY   03?
