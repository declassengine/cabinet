This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;g Government ,/CABINET.AVERAGE GRAVITY OP BEER,Memorandum by the Pood Controller.1,     The decision of the 23rd June to remove all restrictionsas to the quantity of beer which might be brewed but tocontinue to restrict- the permitted average gravity of theoutput of individual brewers, has aggravated, the hardshipwhich control has caused to the brewers of high quality beers.So long as the output was regulated it was possible under asystem of transfer certificates for these brewers to transferpart of their rationed quantity to other   brewers who habitu-ally brewed low quality beerse with the result that theaverage gravity of neither brewery was exceedsdo     Mow thatthe total amount of beer brewed is unrestricted, the systemOf transfer certificates is.no longer-workable as the brewersof low gravity beer no longer secure any advantage by thetransfer of barrelage from the high gravity brewers.   In factno certificates have been issued sines the 1st of this month0The resultant, inability of certain firms to produce the pro-portion of high quality beers which they were enabled to brewthroughout the war constitutes an injustice which appears torequire prompt rernedyc2*     The present maximum average gravity in Ireland is 1051 asagainst 1044 in Great Britain,   This in itself has been opento grave objection as it has enabled the Irish brewers to capture the English market for stout and destroyed the tradeconnections of their English rivals.     Moreover, the restrict-ion of the average gravity In Great Britain to 1044 has des-troyed the special trade of these English firms, who &quot;before thewar produced high class beers, and in some cases brewed at evena higher gravity than the Irish brewers0     It is difficult tojustify at this time arrangements which differentiate unfairlyas between Great Britain and Ireland and arbitrarily penaliseone section of a trade as against another, ,*
1 713fl   Restrictions of gravity together with the restriction of thetotal amount of beer brewed were introduced in 1917 in order to conserve the supply of cereals, and on this ground their cqntinu-ance cannot be defended.    In -view, moreover, of the general Cabinetpolicy to restore trade to a condition -of pre-war freedom, I feel&apos;that it is difficult to justify the maintenance of restrictions which involve serious hardships to individual traders unless their maintenance is attended by compensating benefits to nationalsobrietya46    Owing to the removal of the restrictions on spirits, large supplies of rum and gin are now obtainable, and in the absence ofstronger beer, the consumption of these spirits is increasing.The weakest spirit now permitted to be sold contains 24 per centalcoholf while the strongest beer at present brewed contains only per cent,,     If the restrictions on the gravity of beer were abolition -shed, the average percentage of alcohol would still be below thelatter figure *    It would seem, therefores that it is plainly hene-flcial to encourage tho consumption cf a stronger beer rather thanthat of rum or gine.5*    Nor is there any likelihood of a considerable increase in theaverage gravity of beert,     The maintenance of the present rn.axire.umretail price together with the high beer duty and the &quot;increased costof raw material, labour - and transport constitute a definite restrict-ion on the production of high quality beers*    Although the permittedaverage gravity in Great Britain is now 104.4 the actual brewingaverage is less than 1040.     I am satisfied, therefore,, that beermay now be freed from control as to gravity without hurt and even with advantage to national sobriety,,6S,     1 understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is in accord with me in asking, that all restrictions on the average gravity of beer brewed in the United Kingdom may be removed&amp; ministry OF FOODa &apos; GEORGE * the ROBERTS,
