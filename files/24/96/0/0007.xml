 This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1920.SECRET.THE PEACE WITH TURKEY.to place on record my earnest and emphatic dissent from the decisionarrived at by the majority of the Cabinet yesterday in opposition to the advice of thePrime Minister and two successive Foreign Secretaries to retain the Turk in constantinople. I believe this to be a short-sighted and, in the long run, a most fortunate decision.In order)to avoid trouble in India largely manufactured and in any caseephemeral and to render our task in Egypt less difficult its difficulty being in realityalmost entirely independent of what we may do or not do at Constantinople we arelosing an opportunity for which Europe has waited for nearly five centuries, and whichmay not recur. The idea of a respectable and docile Turkish Government atConstantinople, preserved from its hereditary vices by a military cordon of the Powers including, be it remembered, a permanent British garrison of 10,000-15,000 men is in my judgment a chimera.Nor will it be found that the decision, if carried into effect in Paris, will eithersolve the Turkish problem or calm the Eastern world.The Turk at Constantinople must have very different measure meted out to him from the Turk at Konia. He will retain a sovereignty which will have to be a meresimulacrum, and those who have saved him will, unless I am mistaken, presentlydiscover that his rescue has neither satisfied him nor pacified Islam.But beyond all I regret that the main object for which the war in the East wasfought and the sacrifice of Gtallipoli endured namely, the liberation of Europe from theOttoman Turk has after an almost incredible expenditure of life and treasure been thrown away in the very hour when it had been obtained, and that we shall have leftto our descendants who knows after how much further sacrifice ana) suffering ? a taskfrom which we have flinched.I may add that the refusal of the Cabinet to endorse the scheme prepared byM. Berthelot and myself was resolved upon without any consideration by them of whatthe rival scheme will be, i.e., a Turkish State still centred at Constantinople but under international supervision.   When produced it may cause some surprise.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.Foreign Office, January 7, 1920.\
