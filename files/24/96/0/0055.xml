(CP. 45:5 This Document is the Property of 171__-*^&amp;/J        His Britannic M-ajasty&apos;3 Governm  &apos;*:)Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. 1 , c-. &apos; -&apos;/---&quot;--&apos;------ / i - -&quot;&apos;CONFIDENTIAL.With reference to Mr. churchill&apos;s paper CP. 412, I think my colleagues may be interested to see an extract from a telegram which gives the views of the Government of india on the proposals of their military advisers.E. S. M.13th January 1920.Future hinges largely on attitude of Afghanistan.   We gauge this broadly as follows: Amir and Mahmud Tarzi are dominated by&quot;ainbition to make Afghanistan strong, independent state and to enlarge its boundaries,&apos;but do not fully realise weakness of its resources norits&apos;economic dependence on India.   They regard our Pushto speaking tribes as Afghanistanirredenta which they hope ultimately to worry us into ceding to them, but at same time we believe they regard prospects of expansion in Central Asia as most immediately hopeful.They aim at securing this if possible by friendly agreement with Bolsheviks.   Latter appearanxious concerning Moscow, to have dropped their communistic principles for Central Asianpurposes and to be making hostility to British Empire sole condition of their friendship and support, and to be using pan-Islamism as their main propaganda.   This policy is helped byMahmud Tarzi&apos;s anti-British and pan-Islamic leanings.   In order to win over AfghanistanBolsheviks are believed willing to make considerable territorial concessions, but there are signs that Afghans may demand more than Bolsheviks are prepared to give and that seriousfriction may result between them.   Amirs policy aims at getting as much as possible out ofBolsheviks and British simultaneously and at playing British off against Bolsheviks.   Heprobably uses threats of British alliance and obstinate Turcomans as bogey to frightenBolsheviks just as he appears to be using threats of Bolshevik alliance and intrigues ofPathan tribes of North Eastern Frontier as bogey to frighten us.   In this situation there are undoubtedly two dangers.   First that the Bolsheviks may, for the purpose of diverting Amir&apos;sambitions from Central Asia and embroiling him with us, induce him to join in attack on   *Persia, which they profess to wish to liberate from British dominance; second, that any greatdevelopment or success of pan-Islamic movement might sweep Afghans off their feet and   Ucause them to attack us again with such aid from Bolsheviks as they can get.   If, for instance,recent events in Mesopotamia were to end in Sheriffian party definitely joining anti-Britishand pan-Islamic movement under Turkish suzerainty, and if announcement of Turkishpeace terms were to cause great excitement amongst Indian Moslems, then there might be riskof Afghan attack and of such widespread disorder on frontier and in Persia and Mesopotamiathat available troops would have greatest difficulty in coping with the situation.   Our military advisers are so seriously impressed with this danger that they urge us to make immediatedemands on Amir to expel Bolsheviks and cease intrigues with tribes, and, if he refuses, tobring military pressure to bear upon him.   They state that they are at present able to dealwith Afghanistan by itsel!: before Afridis have committed themselves against us, and whileIndian Moslems are quiescent, as they are confident that troops now in Peshawar neighbour-hood could hold that portion of the frontier, and that Amir would collapse under aerial attacks on Kabul and Jalalabad, &amp;c.   If, however, we miss this present opportunity of either stoppingAfghan intrigues or disposing of Afghanistan by itself, widespread Afridi rising and internaldisorders may, they urge, coincide with or produce next spring or summer open declaration ofAfghan hostility.   Indian units, already below pre-war standards owing to the officer difficulty&apos;will, owing to necessity of granting leave, be below strength for many months, and british units will not be fit for frontier service in hot weather.   Military authorities doubt whethertroops could then deal with situation thus aggravated at the worst season of the year fromclimatic point of vieAv, especially for aerial operations.   While admitting force of these arguments, we still consider that best chance of avoiding trouble is to continue our present policy.   We hope to have settled Waziristan by the middle of February.   This, we hope, maybring Afridis to their senses, and, in the meanwhile, friction between the Afghans andBolsheviks, prospect of which Malleson constantly alludes to, may have definitely developed.Its developments would almost certainly be stopped by our making sharp demands fromAmir now, even if he were ostensibly to comply with them, and would probably bring aboutvery results which we wish to avoid, viz., make him definitely join Bolsheviks and pan-Islamiccamp next summer.   On the other hand, if things move in contrary direction and Amir is bymiddle of February drifting into obviously more hostile attitude, there should still 1 be time to force him to show his hand before hot weather sets in and before Central Asian climate admitsof Bolsheviks helping him in Afghanistan or by serious movement in Central Asia.   If wewere then driven to hostilities, release of troops from Waziristan would place us in a bettermilitary position, but even then we could not, until autumn, undertake more than localoperations combined with aerial raids.
