His Britannic&apos;^^S^L92^QIB^^ -   &apos;SIuORiVNDDM BY TH3 MINISTRY OF SHIPPINGC * P 6 oO 6 *fThe Shipping Controller feels bound to offer some -observations on the memorandum (C*P,386) circulated to the Cabinetby the Food Controller and Lord Crawford,&apos;At the outset it should be stated that since the 50thJune 1919 the British Government has been under no obligation to either the French.cr the Italian Government as regards the provisionof British tonnage for their needs.   When the decision to continueco-operative purchases- was arrived at in August the Controller&apos;3acquiescence;(in si far as his acquiesoenoe was at all necessary),was subject to the express stipulation that the continuance involvednfr revival rf any obligation, in regard to tonnage in the late summer of 1919&apos; it appeared extremelyprobable that with.the aid of German shipping.the grain -and sugarprogrammes of the Ministry of Food could be met without serious difficulty,&apos;    This--hope was falsified by causes out3ide the controlof the Ministry of Shipping/mainly the congestion of the ports inthis.country and the waste of shipping thereby caused,I - At a much earlier period -fee French and Italian-GuvbriifliaatB had increased the large number cf British ,steamerstaken on time&apos; charter, in every case with the full lmowledge that -ithe vessels remained subject to diversion- by the Ministry ofShipping,- and with no. guarantee that that control would not requireto be exercised.      The liability-to this- control was the sole reason why the French&apos;and Italian Governments secured the charters of the sovessels at rates about 40% below the world&apos;1 s time charter marketoIt is not therefore the case that In any real sense .the French or Italian treasuries are making any- contribution to theBritish bread subsidy, . On the contrary on the average they have secured their freight at less than the world rate as a directconsequence of the control of British Shipping exercised by this &quot;Ministry,
The position      this Ministry is perfectly simple.The main justification for the continuance :f control overshipping is the desire of the Government to bring the Govern-ment &apos;cargo (now almost wholly whoatn main; a and sugar) atfreight rates far below . the world&apos;s marmotaPer this purpose the Shipping&quot;.Controller enteredinto an agreement with all the regular lines when their.ships were released from liner requisition whereby 50$ ofall their space was at the disposal of the Controller forthe carriage of Government cargo.at &quot;blue-book&quot; rates *In so far as the lines are not ablo to carry all such cargo and the requirements oannot be met by. German ships,tbe.Shipping Controller relies upon his power to direct trampsto charter to the Royal Commissions.    Every voyage of everyocean-going tramp registered in the United Kingdom is sub-id t ted beforehand to the,Licensing Committee of the Ministryof Shipping and by this means the requisite tonnage is ob-tained*There are, about 600 iramps over 5000 tons deadweighton the United. Kingdom register. ,   ,0f these about 06% are undertime charter to Allied interests (Fiance, Italy, and Belgium)12/y are en charter to, liner; companies and fall under the linerarrangement as regards Government cargo.,.Of the tramps hot on.time charter to either alliedinterests or liner companies slightly more than half are underdirection to load Government cargoes.      Of those on time charter to allies about one quarter are under such direction.When in the late Autumn of 1919 the Wheat Commissionrepresented to the Ministry that a.very large programme of wheat and maize shipments had ty be met it was emphatically pointed -out to thorn that compliance with their demands would involvediversion of tonnage from, the.French and Italians and it wasonly after the most explicit statement from&apos;the wheat Commission
that the consequent political friction with the allies must.be faoed that the Controller took the steps necess ary to divert this tonnage,Any policy which attempted to recognise aright on the part of Prance Or1 Italy to security againstiinterruption of the use of any British ships time charteredby them tiBuld mke the w^rk of this Ministry impossible4itie Shipping Control ler would deprecate stronglyany policy which would-involve the Tesumption of british responsibility for meeting allied or relief shipping pro-grammes.      Such a policy would involve the indefinitecontinuance of otntrol of British shipping for the benefitof the Foreign and to the detriment of British commerce.Two instances will show olearly the defectsin the present system of commodity control,(1)     It is understood that financial reasons makeit impracticable for the Government to buy sugar in Javawith the result that the needs of this country can only bemet on the Cuba market.     The rise in price in that market was so pronounced that the Sigar Ccmmi ssion refrained - frompurchases in December, in the &quot;hope of forcing a reduction.But they represented to the Controller that the sugar positionhere was such as to make It.essential that tonnage should beavailable in Cuba Ho load there the moment they bought.    this could only be&apos;&apos;achieved by sending vessels there in advance to wait until such time as the sugar was ready and ships werein fact kept idle, ,(2)   It is understood that the Vhoat Commission -made heavy purchases of maize in the Plate before the pricefell.     The position&apos;before the end of the year was that private grain merchants could purchase in the Plate ship to this country&apos;at freight about 80/-&apos;per ton above that
at which, this Ministry provided tonnage for the RoyalComnisaiori and still soil in this country at the Controlledprice of-maize*The last instance appears to the Controllorto demonstrate. conclusively that the decontrol of grainand the transference&apos; of the trade to private hands will result in a more efficient, maintenance of supplies and areduction in the real cost to the Co:m;:unity4There is one ether aspect of the shipping position whioh,,.calls urgently for attention.When, after the armistice, the G-overnmentdecided to reverse the policy of requisition, it was anticipated&apos; that 1919 would see a substantial fall in theworld1 s freight market,,      Although in particular trades,such as the Egyptian and Indian,, such a fall has takenplace, the hope of a general fall has been disappointed.The explanation is to be found not in a shortage of shipsthemselves - there is substantially more tonnage in theworld to -day - than there ever has been and far less to move -* ,but in the fact that ships cannot be&apos;1 effectively handled inthe ports.     This reduction in efficiency cannot be put at less than 40;.&apos;,      Every important port in this country to-da;:is congested with ships which cannot be expeditiously dis-&apos; charged and the inability to Discharge these ships createsa shortage of ships available for loading grain.in the onlymarket (that of the Plate) where financial reasons makes itprudent for us to buy. &apos;  -The Shipping Controller fears that unless a radical improvement in the condition of the ports can beeffected, the result of the action which he has been.forcedto take to fill the Wheat Commission Programme-will be the arrival in this country in February, March and April of largequantities of grain which it will he impossibly to discharge.
Inquiries made at the different ports all tendto show that the root of.all the difficulties now being exper-ienoed is to be found in labour and not in any lack of meohan-ical applianoo3,      IThereas before the war it was possible bymeans of shifts to carry work on through the whole 24 hours and so obtain the maximum advantage from machinery etc., now the unions will not allow continuous work,      This attitudeof labour affects every Unit in the chain from the chip to.the consumer, -slowing down the whole process of absorptionand increasing considerably the ultimate cost to the .comonmity,The Shipping Controller would urge on the Cabinetthat steps should now be taken to bring homo to the leaders oflabour themselves that the solution of. the country1 s: difficult!rests largely if not entirely with labour itself, that therestoration of pre-war commercial activity,without which the ..United Kingdom cannot hope permanently to maintain its presentpopulation, depends upon the readiness of the working man togive a fair day&apos;s work in return for a fair wage.(Signed) J. P, KACLAY.6th January,1920.
