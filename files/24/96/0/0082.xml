*MI* /j. WUMKDITEKRAKEM *Correspondence has recently passed between the GreekPrime Minister and the Bulgarian President of the Council onthe subject of Bulgarian aooess to the Mediterranean (Aegean Sea).Such access is represented on the Bulgarian side, as a political,geographical and economic necessitycMoVenizelos;, while pointing out that Dedeagatoh wouldbe insufficient as an outlet, expressed his willingness to allowBulgaria economic facilities under the League of Nations atCavalla.Tangier.&quot;&quot;&apos;The position is now reported to be normal. The Spanishcruiser &quot;Reina Regente&quot; has sailed from Tangier Bay and arrivedat Cadiz.   The gunboat &quot;lay a&quot; is now at Tangiero.Orders weregiven for a British destroyer to be held in readiness at gibraltar, in case the necessity should arise to shew the flag atTangier, hut it is not likely that she will be required The fact which gave rise to the reports in the French press of the landing of Spa/nish troops at Tangier was that a detachment of 50&quot;men,going from Ceuta to Regaia via Alcasar Seguir were prevented byrough weather from landing at the last-named place, and thereforelanded unarmed at Tangier, with, it is claimed, the permission of the Moroccan authorities *RED______SEA.&quot;CENTAUR&quot; with Field Marshal Lord Allenby on boardleft Jedda for Port Sudan on the 10th January.EAST   INDIES,&quot;TRIAD&quot;, for duties in Persian   Gulf arrived at aden on 14th JanuaryoNORTH AMERICA AND WEST INDIES ,Admiral Lord Jellicoe in &quot;NEW ZEALAND&quot; arrived at PortRoyal, Jamaicaj on 13th January and left again for Trinidad on14th January.SOUTH   AMERICA,&quot;YARMOUTH&quot; arrived at Kingston, Jamaica on passage to her station.)GERMANY,Sumender of Merchant VesseIs gOne additional German vessel has been surrendered to allied and Associated Management up to midnight, 17th January,bringing the total to 354, plus 9 tankers.The Navy Budget cBelow is given a detail of the personnel provided forin this budgetc For comparison, the numbers of the last pre-warBudget are also stated * *

Rear^Admiral Le Vavasseur,assistacn^&apos;6ro%.S. will leave1 soon after, but probably not  until al the Peace Treaties have been signed and ratified. Vice-AdmiralGrasset, at present-in-C at Cherbourg, has been suggested as apossible successor to Admiral Ronarc&apos;h but all depends upon who may be the new Minister of Marine.Before committing her to a definite programme shipbuilding, Italyrs naval advisers are waiting to see what effecthe League of Nations has on armaments. Should the League ofNations not come into, existence, Italy is likely to follow thecourse of events in France and model her navaij. policy in accordantwith the French programme. With the collapse of Austro-Hungarythe Adriatic has lost its military importance and attention isbeing transferred to the Tyrrhenian coast Instead.   Italy Is in-clined to reduce her naval forces proportionately to any similarsteps taken by France, but, at the-same time proposes to keep herfleet up to at least 60$ standard.Italian Kaval opinion has lost faith in the capitalsliip.    Italy will pay more attention to the construction of light cruisers, torpedo craft, submarines, aeroplanes andseaplanes, and will defend her coasts with batteries armed withlong-range guns, of which four have already been minted nearVenice, and preparations made&apos;,for mounting four more near Spezia,(15&quot; guns).The fleet, on a peace time basis, wijl most probablybe composed as foll&amp;ws2 Dreadnoughts in full commission^.3 Dreadnoughts in first reserve,All pre-Dreadnought battleships&quot; in &amp;nd and 3rd reserve1 Pivision of cruisers (4) in full commission.3 Scouts in full commission.3 Divisions of destroyers (4 in each) in full commissi..All other ships in reserve.
