Tina Pooiimetit is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.)Printed for the Home Ports Defence Committee. December 1919.SECRET.40-M.CHANNEL TUNNEL.Memorandum by the Home Ports Defence Committee.Part I.Main Conditions to be Satisfied from a Naval, Military and Air Point of View.THE War Office have referred for the consideration of the Home Ports DefenceCommittee the question of the conditions necessary from a Naval, Military andAir point of view to ensure the security of the exit of a Channel Tunnel.The War Office letter dated the 9th&apos; May, 1919, is reproduced as an appendix to this Memorandum.2. The question referred to the Committee does not involve the consideration ofthe general question as to whether the construction of a tunnel is desirable or not.The Committee have accordingly confined their remarks, sst forth below^ to dealingwith the actual conditions necessary from a Naval, Military and Air point of viewto ensure the security of the exit of a tunnel on the English coast; and the extent .to which they are of opinion that it is practicable to meet these conditions.3. During the various discussions which have taken place in the past on the advisability or otherwise of constructing a Channel Tunnel, one of the points onwhich there has been general agreement is that approval to carry out any scheme should be dependent upon its being possible to devise some easy means of blockingor destroying a tunnel in time of emergency; and on its being practicable to makethe means so devised reasonably secure at any time against damage or destruction bya potential enemy. *r 4. It has been argued with great weight by various eminent naval and militaryauthorities that, without some such easy means of blocking or destroying a tunnelin time of emergency, it is conceivable that, in certain circumstances, the British endmight be seized, and that with a hostile Power in possession of the other end it couldbe used as a means for invading the United Kingdom.5. The experiences of the war and the new conditions created thereby do not afford any grounds for modifying the views previously held, and in this connection it is necessary to remember that from time to time the political relations of countriesinevitably change, and that, although under existing conditions the exit of the tunnelon the Continental side would be in. the hands of a Power with whom England is on terms of closest friendship, there can be no guarantee that it will at all times in thefuture be in friendly hands. On the other hand the tunnel once constructed will bealways there until destroyed; and, even though great changes may take place in thefuture in the International situation, it is almost inconceivable that the destruction *of a tunnel costing anything from 30 to 50 million pounds to build, will becontemplated except in the last emergency, and when war with the Power inpossession of the other end is imminent, or has even broken out. It is essential,therefore, that means should exist for putting the tunnel both temporarily andpermanently out of service at a moment&apos;s notice.6. Further, the experiences of the last few years have shown of what great valuethe existence of a tunnel would have been for transporting troops and stores toFrance at various stages of the war, provided that it had not been destroyed in viewof the situation existing in the early Autumn of 1914, and these experiences haveconsequently emphasised indirectly the importance in certain circumstances ofbeing able to protect a tunnel against any attempt by an enemy to destroy it.7. The military members of the Committee now urge the importance of bearing that mind that once a tunnel is constructed it will become a leading factor in all military plans for war, that in all cases in which France is our ally, the assuredmaintenance of the tunnel will relieve the Navy of a certain amount of convoy andtransport work, and that consequently the arrangements for its efficient protection
M: iiagainst attempts to destroy it may be even more important than the arrangementsfor denying its use to a hostile Power. Further, it is argued that should the tunnelbe put out of action by an enemy the British Forces would be in a worse position than if it had never been constructed at all, since there would not be the same amountof cross-channel shipping immediately available to replace it as would be the case if it had never been made.8. This latter question is one which in the enquiries which took place previousto the war does not appear to have been regarded of great importance, and most ofthe discussions referred to were principally taken up with the consideration of how a tunnel could best be destroyed in order to deny its use to an enemy Power in possessionof the other end. This new condition will necessitate the revision of the safeguardsformerly proposed.9. In existing conditions, therefore, it appears that from a naval and military point of view the main conditions which must be satisfied, if the construction of aChannel Tunnel is approved, are: (a.) The English end of the tunnel must be so defended as to make it secureagainst capture by any form of raiding attack, which it is thoughtpossible may be employed with a view to seizing it.(b.) Some of the means provided for putting the tunnel out of service must be such as to make its repair either altogether impracticable, or at any rateimpracticable within such a period as it is thought possible that an enemyforce might be able to keep possession of the English end.(c.) Means for putting the tunnel out of service must at all times be capable ofbeing used at a moment&apos;s notice, and so guarded and protected that thereis no reasonable probability of their being put out of working order by enemy gun-fire, bombing, raiding parties or sabotage.(d.) The tunnel itself, its approaches and any machinery vital to its use must at all times be so protected and guarded that there is no reasonableprobability of their being put out of use by enemy gun-fire, bombing,raiding parties, or sabotage.10. It remains now to consider firstly, to what extent these conditions can becomplied with, and secondly, whether such measures as are considered practicablewill be adequate to meet the forms of attack considered possible^The Committee purposely refer to the forms of attack considered possible,although it is usual only to provide defences to meet such forms of attack as are regarded as probable; but in a case such as this where national independence mightbe at stake it is considered that all possible attacks must be taken into account. (Seeparagraph 12 below.)Part II.Possible Forms of Attack.11. The possibility of an attempt being made by an enemy to land a raidingforce on the coasts of the United Kingdom has been considered by the Committee ofImperial Defence on several occasions in the past, viz., by Mr. Balfour in 1905, by aSub-Committee set up by Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman in 1907, and presided overby Mr. Asquith, and again by a special Committee under the Chairmanship ofMr. Asquith in 1914.12. The Report of the Committee which sat in 1914 states: &quot;As pointed out by Mr. Balfour in 1905, it is justifiable, and indeednecessary, in discussing the problem of invasion, where true solution involvessuch a vital issue as national independence, to make a series of assumptionsunfavourable to this country.&quot; &quot;National independence&quot; he wrote, &quot;mustnot be staked even in appearance-on too nice a calculation of chances. Wecannot sleep secure with only a bare margin of probability in our favour.&quot;13. On this preliminary assumption the Committee of 1914 endorsed theconclusion of the Report of the 1907 Enquiry, namely : ;&quot; The Committee consider that the possibility of an attack being made upon this country during normal diplomatic relations is not sufficiently renfote to be ignored. They agree with Mr. Balfour that if the German Governmentbelieved that, the adoption of such a plan made a difference between failureand success it is conceivable that they might resort to it.&quot;
* Note. In this connection it must be remembered that with the great. improvements that may takeplace in the manufacture of lethal weapons, it is possible that in the no distant future the tunnel exit may-be well within the range of guns mounted on the French coast, or even the Belgian coast. Already Doveris within easy range of guns of the &quot; Big Bertha &quot; type.Again, in referring in their Summary of Recommendations to the steps to betaken to meet any possible raiding attacks, the Committee of 1914 stated: &quot; 10. Representatives of the Admiralty and War Office should reportwithout delay as to the object, strength and nature of the raiding attack to beprovided against at each port or locality on the coast of the United Kingdom,where such an attack may be deemed possible and probable.....  It may beassumed for purposes of calculation that the maximum reasonably probable scale of raiding attack at any particular point will be 10,000 men, and that the attackmay be made immediately on the outbreak&apos; of war .... The General Stallshould then reconsider the war garrisons accordingly, and submit their proposals to His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;14. It will be observed therefore that as late as April, 1914, the Committee ofImperial Defence, after an exhaustive and independent examination of the question^were of opinion that an attempt to land a raiding force on the coasts of Englandwas one of the forms of attack which ought to be provided for, and further refusedto rule out of consideration the admittedly remote possibility of such an attack beingmade during normal diplomatic relations.15. In the circumstances, the Committee are of opinion that the most importantform of attack which must be guarded against is essentially that of a raiding attackto seize the English end of the tunnel either after war has broken out, during the precautionary stage, or even during normal diplomatic relations.If an enemy can be prevented from seizing this end of the tunnel he cannot use it for invasion purposes, he cannot repair it if flooded or temporarily blocked, andhe cannot absolutely ensure (except by similar action on the French coast) the tunnelfrom being used as a means of communication to France.Moreover minor safeguards such as placing the power station and the ventilatingand pumping apparatus on the English side of the Channel, however necessary tomeet at a moment&apos;s notice certain emergencies, will all in the long run be of no availif an enemy in possession of the French end can seize the English exit, and hold it&apos;for a sufficient time to improvise these apparatus.16. The other forms of attack to which the English end of a tunnel, the tunnelworks, and the tunnel itself may be exposed are : Bombardment from the sea or from the French or Belgian coasts, * orbombing by aircraft.A surprise attack carried out by small raiding parties landed from the sea or from aeroplanes.Sabotage.Attempts to destroy the tunnel by means of explosive charges placed on thebed of the Channel or by boring.Attempts by secret agents to place explosive charges with clockworkmechanism in trains passing through the tunnel.One or other of these latter forms of attack is likely to be resorted to: (a.) By an enemy desiring to use the tunnel himself who might attempt thedestruction of the means provided for putting the tunnel out of service.In this case it is probable that an attack of this description might becarried out in conjunction with, or immediately preceding, a bigger orraiding attack to seize the end of the tunnel itself.(6.) By an enemy wishing to prevent the use of the tunnel, who might attemptto seize temporarily the means of putting the tunnel out of service withthe object of putting it out of service and preventing its use as a meansof communication with France. .(c.) By an enemy with the same object-as in (b), who might seek to destroy themachinery installations or other works vital to the working of the tunnelor the tunnel itself, in order to put the tunnel out of service.
Part III.Defence Measures Necessary to meet Possible Forms of Attack.17. Generally speaking, the defence measures which will be necessary to ensurethe tunnel against seizure by an enemy for invasion purposes will also provide forits protection against being put out of service as a means of communication with france.18. The possible forms of attack referred to in Part II and the defence measures necessary to meet them will now be considered seriatim: (a.) An attack by a raiding force such as that contemplated by the Committeeof Imperial Defence in 1914 (see paragraph 13 above).The Committee are of opinion that, since, as already explained, such vital interests are at stake, the possibility of a raiding attack with a view to seizing theEnglish end of a tunnel must be met by the provision of such naval, military andair defences as will ensure the success of an attack of this description being such aremote contingency as to make it extremely improbable that an enemy will everattempt an operation of the kind.At the present stage, and until such time as more definite information is avail-able concerning the exact site of the tunnel entrance, the Committee do not feelthat they are in a position to make any detailed recommendations as to the defenceswhich will be required, but these defences will, it is thought, have to include: &apos;(i.) An extended naval defence and land defences in order to deter an enemyfrom attempting to carry out a landing operation anywhere on the coastwithin striking distance of the tunnel entrance, or to prevent bombard-,ment of the tunnel works,(ii.) The garrisoning at all times of a mobile force of all arms in the near vicinity of the tunnel entrance of such a strength as will be sufficient, in theopinion of the Army Council, successfully to deal with a raiding force by sea or air, of a size which will vary according to the circumstances prevailing at any particular time and will have to be constantlyreviewed.(iii.) The provision of an efficient air defence and anti-aircraft defence to dealwith any enemy aircraft which may be used for reconnoitring purposes,observation of fire, or the direct support by bombing or otherwise of anyattack against the tunnel entrance.; -,: :(b.) Bombardment from the Sea or Bombing by Aircraft.Bombardment from the sea or bombing by aircraft will be met in the firstinstance by the provision of the defences referred to in the preceding paragraph.In order, however, to provide further safeguards, the following steps arenecessary: (i.) All the arrangements for putting the tunnel out of service- and all themachinery vital to its use to be duplicated and put, so far as practicable,underground, each installation being separate and guarded at all times,(ii.) The entrance of the tunnel on the British side to be: First. Duplicated.Second. So situated and constructed as to render its destruction from thesea or from the land on the opposite side of the Straits extremelyimprobable.Third. So far as practicable away from the coast and hidden fromobservation.(iii.) Important yards and junctions in connection with the tunnel to be sitedwell inland; and there must be two or more small yards rather than one large one, viz., one for up traffic, one for down traffic, and one forlocomotives.(c.) Surprise attacks by small raiding parties landed from the sea or from aircraft, or Sabotage.In addition to the defence measures already mentioned, the following safe-guards should be resorted to, in order to guard against small raiding attacks^ orSabotage: 
(i.) All the arrangements for putting the tunnel out of service and all themachinery to be guarded at all times and surrounded by obstacles, and electric lights to be provided for lighting up the ground in the vicinityby night.(ii.) The entrances of the tunnel to be guarded and protected by obstacles.(d.) A ttempts to destroy the tunnel by submarines resting on the bed of theChannel.Attempts to destroy the tunnel by means of explosive charges placed on the bedof the sea must be guarded against by constructing the tunnel so far below the bottom of the Channel as to render it immune from such attacks. The depth below the bedof the sea necessary to ensure this is an engineering question on which the Com-mittee are not in a position to offer an opinion, and they suggest that it should bedetermined by experiment.(e.) Attempts by secret agents to place explosive charges in trains passing through the tunnel.Attempts to place charges of explosive with clockwork mechanism in trainspassing through the tunnel can only be guarded against by a careful scrutiny of allpackages and luggage before loading. Assuming that the Continental end of thetunnel is in the hands of a friendly Power, such scrutiny will be an essential pre-caution at both ends during any period of strained relations.Part IV.Measures for Temporarily or Permanently, putting a Tunnel out of Service.19. As already explained, such vital interests are at stake that, in addition tothe actual defences to be provided to meet any possible form of enemy attack, it isessential that some means should exist by which, at a momenfs notice, the tunnelcould be put out of service temporarily or permanently, or both, as desired.20. Various expedients have from time to time been suggested with this object in view, and of these the following appear most worthy of consideration and will beconsidered seriatim: (a.) Methods for permanent or temporary flooding.Permanent flooding. The following arrangements have been suggested with aview to providing for the permanent flooding of the tunnel: (i.) The provision of sluices to admit the sea, the sluices to be controlled from afort on the English coast; or(ii.) Explosive charges placed in a chamber midway between the bed of the sea and the crown of the tunnel.As regards (i.) the Committee have been favoured with the views of the Ministryof Transport on this question, and are informed that that Department are of opinionthat, if provision were to be made for letting in the sea at short notice and that thepublic were aware that such arrangements were in existence, strong pressure mightbe brought to bear upon the Government to see that no undue risk was taken of thetunnel being accidentally flooded, and further that the machinery would have to be tested frequently which would not only dislocate traffic but might involve considerable risk.It is understood that for these reasons the Ministry of Transport are of opinionthat any arrangement for letting in the sea by sluices would become Ineffectual after a short time, and that it would be preferable not to have any sluices at all by whichthe sea could be admitted.As regards explosive charges the Committee are informed that it would be practicable to arrange for such charges midway between the bottom of the sea andthe crown of the tunnel, and by the explosion of these charges to admit the sea intothe tunnel.In connection with any proposal to rely solely on explosive charges for floodingpurposes the Committee feel bound to draw attention to the fact that numerousinstances have occurred in the past of the failure to fire explosive charges at the critical moment, or of their failure, when fired, to effect the purpose for which[&quot;18161 C
provided. The risk of such failures is greater in view of the possibility, eventhough remote, of a sudden coup de main against the English end of the tunneland the consequent possibility of the enemy being able to anticipate the laying ofthe charges.The Committee are, however, of opinion that, as a means for letting in thesea in the last resort, arrangements should be made so that charges such as thosesuggested could be placed if required.Until the plans of the tunnel are available, and the question can be considered in detail, as an engineering proposition, the Committee do not feel that any finaldecision as to the precise method of flooding the tunnel ought to be taken. Inpresent circumstances they cannot go beyond a general recommendation that someeffective means should be provided for flooding the whole of the tunnel in the lastemergency.Temporary Flooding. With a view to the temporary flooding of the tunnelit has been suggested that it should be constructed with a &quot; dip &quot; near both endsin order to minimise the amount of water necessary to block it and also the time taken to do this.It has been argued that either the French or English authorities could in thesecircumstances fill their respective &apos;&apos; dips&apos;&apos; either by means of sluices or fromreservoirs, if so desired, and that neither would be able to pump out the &quot;dip&quot;controlled by the other.While this may be true, provided that the English end of the tunnel does not fall into the hands of an enemy, it is not, in the opinion of the Committee, a sufficientsafeguard, especially since they are informed that a &quot; dip &quot; a mile long could bepumped out in one to three days with an ordinary 15in. sinking pump.The Committee consider, however, that in order to provide means for rapidlyputting the tunnel out of action, without entirely destroying it, a &quot; dip &quot; should beprovided. . It will be for consideration whether the arrangements for flooding the&quot; dip &quot; should not be capable also of flooding the whole tunnel if required.(b.) Facilities for bringing fire to bear on the exit of the tunnel.As a subsidiary means of denying at a momenfs notice the use of the tunnelto an enemy who has entered it from the other end, it has been suggested that afort with impassable ditches and drawbridges firing on the English exit should beprovided.    The Committee concur in this view.Again, it has been suggested that the railway line on emerging from the tunnelshould be so constructed on a viaduct or bridge as to be under the fire of ships ofwar in the Channel; and it has been argued that in such circumstances, if a hostilePower had seized the tunnel by a coup de main, the viaduct or bridge could be easily destroyed by bombardment from the sea.The converse of this argument is also true, and the viaduct or bridge might also be destroyed from the sea by an enemy raiding force. It may be argued thatwith the command of the sea such an operation is very improbable. With the advent, however, of submarines and aircraft and the experiences of the late war, itis submitted that the possibility of such an operation cannot be totally neglected,and, in view of the importance attached by the War Office to being able to keepopen a tunnel in time of war, the proposal that the line should run on a viaduct orbridge exposed to fire from the sea is one that cannot be recommended.(c.) Means external to the land defences on the English coast of admitting thesea into the tunnel in the last resort.It has been suggested that it would be well within the power of the engineerto construct close to the English coast a tower of lighthouse type which could beconnected with the tunnel by a shaft, and in the last resort destroyed by shells ortorpedoes fired from a warship in order to admit the sea into the tunnel.The Committee consider that for the same reasons as have been advancedagainst the proposal for a viaduct or bridge exposed to fire from the sea theconstruction of such a tower would be undesirable.(d.) Mechanical means of temporarily obstructing a tunnel.It has been suggested that, in addition to means for flooding, some subsidiarymeasure is necessary which would make it impossible for a train to complete itsjourney through the tunnel without the concurrence of the authorities on the Britishside.
It has been pointed out to the Committee in this connection that the provisionof means for flooding the tunnel would not guarantee security against its use by araiding force as a &quot;bolt from the blue,&quot; and that although this is an &quot;extremelyimprobable contingency,&apos;&apos; it would be necessary, in order to satisfy public opinion,to have some means of preventing at a moment&apos;s notice a train from completing itsjourney through the tunnel. It is further contended in the same connection thatthe flooding of the tunnel would do very great damage, and would not be resortedto unless the exit on the French coast was in imminent danger of coming under thecontrol of a hostile Power.For these reasons it has been suggested that some such precaution as thefollowing should be adopted: (i.) The weight of the train on entering a certain section to operate a stronggate closing the tunnel against further progress,(ii.) The mechanism for putting the gate out of action, or for opening it after it has closed, to be installed in a defended post some distance inland onthe English side.(iii.) A British examining post to be at the French end of the tunnel and to telegraph in code when each train leaves; and, in time of peace, on receipt of the code message the gate to be opened so that the passageof the train should not be delayed.It is argued that by these means any surprise attempt to send through a traincould be automatically frustrated since the door would shut against it if the codemessage clearing the train had not been received on the English side.The Committee are doubtful if complete reliance could be placed in all circum-stances on the system of receiving a code message from a British control at the otherend of the tunnel, which would be presumably in hostile hands if any attempt werebeing made to pass a force through; and again they are of opinion that any arrange-ment such as that proposed would, if in the centre of the tunnel, be liable to betampered with by secret agents entering from the other end.They recommend, however, that as a subsidiary means of blocking the tunnelat a moment&apos;s notice an obstacle should be provided on the British side of the&quot; dip.&quot; A blockhouse should be constructed immediately in rear of this obstacle,and an examining post should be provided at the British end of the tunnel.(e.) Siting of power station and the ventilating and pumping apparatus on theg English side.It has been suggested that, as a further precaution and with a view to preventing at a momenfs notice the use of the tunnel, the power station and theventilating and pumping apparatus should be sited on the English side.As another possible means of temporarily putting the tunnel out of service theCommittee concur in the desirability of the power station being sited on the Englishside, but at the same time they wish to point out that with the engineeringappliances of to-day they do not anticipate that any Power in possession of the other,end of the tunnel, and contemplating an attempt to pass troops through, wouldhave any great difficulty in making arrangements which would, when the time came, nullify the safeguard in question.Part V.General Conclusions./ 21. To summarise, the Home Ports Defence Committee are of opinion that thefollowing conditions should be complied with; (a.) The scale and forms of Defence (Naval, Military and Air) must be such asto deal effectively with a raiding, attack by such force as may from time toI time be considered possible,, and also other forms of attack to which theBritish end of a tunnel, the tunnel works and the tunnel itself may be exposed, i.e. : ......,.....(J.) Bombardment from the sea or from the French or Belgian coasts, orbombing by aircraft;[1816] &quot;D
(2.) Surprise attacks carried out by small raiding parties landed fromthe sea or from aircraft;(S.) Sabotage;(4.) Attempts to destroy the tunnel by means of explosive charges placedof the bed of the Channel or by boring;(5.) Attempts by secret agents to place explosive charges with clockwork^        mechanism in trains passing through the tunnel:- (b.) Means to be provided for putting the tunnel out of service temporarily, orpermanently, or both, as desired : i(i.) Permanent Flooding. Sluices to admit the sea and arrangementsfor quickly placing explosive charges in a chamber midwaybetween the sea and the top olf the tunnel have been suggested, but until the actual plans of the tunnel are available, and the questioncan be considered as an engineering proposition, no final decision as to the precise method of permanently flooding the tunneican be arrived at. Some effective means must, however, beprovided for flooding the whole of the tunnel in the last emergency,and in any case chambers for explosive charges must be provided.(ii.) Temporary Flooding&quot; dip &quot; in the tunnel to be constructedwithin three miles of the British coast, and arrangements to bemade for flooding this&apos;: dip&quot; either from the sea or from areservoir.(c.) All the arrangements for putting the tunnel out of service, either temporarilyor permanently, and all the machinery installations vital to its use to beduplicated and put so far as practicable underground; each installationbeing separate, guarded at all times, and surrounded by obstacles; and electric lights to be provided to illuminate the ground in the vicinity by night.(d.) The tunnel to be constructed at such depth below the bed of the sea as, will ensure its immunity from damage by explosives placed on the bottom ofthe sea.(e.) The entrance of the tunnel on the British side to be : (i.) Duplicated.(ii.) So situated and constructed as to render its destruction from the sea or from the land on the opposite side of the Straits extremelyimprobable.(iii.) So far as practicable away from the coast and hidden fromobservation.(iv.) Protected by obstacles as well as by armed troopp.(/.) Some guns to be so mounted as to be capable of firing on the tunnel entrances.(g.) Important yards and junctions to be sited well inland; and one or more: yards to be constructed in preference to one large one, viz., one for uptraffic, one for down traffic, and one for locomotives.(h.) An obstacle and a blockhouse in rear of it to be provided at the English endof the tunnel; and other simple methods (such as engineering science maydevise) for temporarily preventing, if necessary, the progress of trains inthe tunnel to be provided, e.g., taking up or short-circuiting rails,impassable ditch or drawbridge near the British exit and under gun fire.(i.) The power station to be sited on the English side.(j.) Arrangements to be made for the scrutiny, in times of strained relations, ofall packages and luggage before loading on trains about to pass throughthe tunnel; and also for an examining post within the British end of thetunnel where trains could be stopped.22. As regards the responsibility for putting into action any means for putting the tunnel out of service, the Committee are of opinion that it is of vital importance that this responsibility should be clearly defined. This would be simplified if thetunnel were Government-owned,23. The Committee are unable at this juncture to make any recommendationsfurther to those enumerated above for securing the safety of the United Kingdomagainst the use of the tunnel for invasion purposes, and for safeguarding the tunnel
itself against being put out of service. They are of opinion that the resources of engineering science may devise other methods, and, if so, that these should be care-fully considered and adopted if found effective.24. Whilst they are of opinion that the mechanical devices outlined above would ensure the security of the tunnel in theory, they recognise that in practice the personalfactor will always introduce a.certain element of danger.They accordingly desire to lay stress on the fact that the ultimate security against an enemy in occupation of the Continental end of the tunnel being able to use it for invasion purposes rests on the fundamental condition of its being possible toensure that the British end should not be seized by a raiding force. Only armed force can absolutely secure this, and it is consequently essential to provide for thegarrisoning at all times in the vicinity of the tunnel entrance of a mobile forcesufficient to deal successfully with a raiding attack, the strength of which will haveto be kept constantly under review.(Signed)     S.
