SUMMARY.The successes of the Red Army have produced a profoundimpression on the revolutionary bodies in the different countries,and there is a great recrudescence of propaganda. Delegates are proceeding secretly to Holland, where they will receive instructions as to the place of meeting for the Third (Moscow) International,probably in Germany and possibly in occupied territory. Earlyintimation as to the place is expected, and, if necessary, a warningwill be given to the authorities concerned. The Second Internationalwill soon lapse if the secessions continue. The secession of theGerman Independents has made it impossible for the ExecutiveCommittee to hold a Congress in February as it hoped. Probablythrough the influence of the Swiss Socialist Party a new Internationalwill be formed, holding more moderate views than the Third and more advanced views than the Second.In France the extreme parties are very active with propaganda,but they are nervous as to what will happen if M. Clemenceaubecomes President. /There has been little change in Switzerland.The recent disturbances in Berlin may extend, though the greatbody of the people is tired of war and disorder.The Austrian Communists are making little progress and arewithout funds. In a recent party meeting JRadek warned the delegates against immature revolutions.The storm centre at the moment is in Spain, where foreigners,and particularly Germans, have been active in furnishing money andprovoking discontent. The attempted assassination of the Presidentof the Employers&apos; Federation in Barcelona on the 6th January andthe abortive mutiny in the Saragossa Garrison have urged theGovernment to strong action. A number of arrests have been made,but PestaTia, the local leader, has disappeared.The Socialists in Italy are beginning to fear a reaction. they realise that the country is not yet ripe for revolution.In Greece there are no labour disturbances and no signs of bolshevism.The Polish Government is not strong. News of the recentoffensive on the Dvinsk front lias been received with great enthusiasm.There is good reason for believing that the United States Govern-ment will have no dealings with the present authorities in Soviet[2023] B 2
Eussia, and will not over-hastily recognise any Government that maysucceed it until it is clear.that it is really democratic and non-Bolshevik.In Finland there is a strong movement for intervention in Russia,unsupported by the Government.There is a possibility of a new &quot;Bermondt&quot; adventure underVassilkovsky, who is believed to be in the pay of the Germans andis endeavouring to organise an army of 100,000&quot; White&quot; russians to advance on Moscow.There are indications that Bolshevism is losing ground in scandinavia. The recent Scandinavian Bolshevik Congress in stockholm aroused little interest.In Egypt there are indications that the moderate elements of theNationalist Party may shortly negotiate with Lord Milner&apos;s Corn-mission.The situation in Central Asia is very disquieting. propaganda is active and troops are said to be concentrating in Turkestan. It isclear that the Bokharans wish to remain neutral, but the relationsbetween the Bolsheviks and the Afghans are still obscure.The great strikes in the coal and steel industries in the UnitedStates have both come to an end.. The arrest and deportation offoreign Extremists has caused considerable excitement, and willprobably have the effect of driving Communist activities under-ground.The first instance of international solidarity among Labour hasbeen shown in Belgium, where, during the moulders&apos; strike, Belgianmoulders who had worked in England refused to execute orders froma British firm, which they thought would be &quot; blacklegging &quot; thestrikeis.
CONFIDENTIAL.151A Keview of Revolutionary Movements in ForeignCountries, December 1919.PART I.Prance. The efforts of the Extremists to interest the people in the Russian revolution and to induce them to force the Govern-ment to recognise the Soviet Government in Russia have so farmet with dismal failure. This was confessed by speakers at an administrative Commission of the Confederation Generale duTravail, which was held on the 10th December, where it was statedthat the meetings which have been held to protest against Frenchintervention in Russia have been poorly attended. As a general rule, the recent efforts of the Extremists to induce the&apos; working (classes to strike have been unsuccessful. The manifestations,arranged for the 7th December, at which it is to be noted that neither Longuet, who is now accused of treachery at the recentelections, nor Verfeuil were asked to speak, were not at all suc-cessful. The attendance at each of these meetings was poor, themost complete fiasco being at a meeting where 2,000 people were expected and only eight persons appeared !On ihe other hand, there seems to be a renewed activity inrevolutionary circles possibly owing to the recent successes of theReds against Koltchak and Denikin and the Socialist Federationhas just voted the sum of 500,000 fr. for Socialist propaganda duringthe first- three months of the current year. The Socialist Party is anxious to form an alliance with the Confederation Gen^rale duTravail in preparation for an attempt at a revolution which is being planned for the 1st May. Jouhaux is not in favour of this alliance,and a deputation from the Socialist Party, headed by Cachin andSenibat, which put forward definite proposals to the ConfederationGenerale du Travail was not favourably received.Bolshevik pamphlets by Sadoul are being widely distributed, andTAssociation Republicaine des Anciens Combattants is also carryingon an active propaganda. Although the doctrines of this Associa-tion are mainly theoretical its leaders, many of whom are Jews,openly boast that their organisation will be the only one which willbe instrumental in bringing about a revolution. At a recent meeting a unanimous vote was given in favour of organising theInternational of ex-soldiers. A Congress is to be held at which thesoldiers of the various belligerent nations are to meet and to proclaim the reconciliation of the peoples in an imposing manifestowhich will denounce war and the organising of wars. An invitation to attend this Congress has been accepted by the National Union of ex-Service Men in the United Kingdom.The miners appear to be determined to push matters to extremes.At a recent meeting of the Federation des Mineurs du Centre et du
Nord de la France a vote was passed by a large majority in favourof a General Strike on the 18th February unless the government before that date agrees to the demands of the miners. these demands include State Control of the Mines, a minimum salary of25 fr. a day, and a pension of 1,800 fr. after fifteen years&apos; work. Inview of the coal crisis it would seem that the Government may be obliged to concede to these demands. The metal workers are also said to be contemplating putting forward claims of a similarcharacter, but do not propose to take any action for the next three or four months.The most dangerous movement, however, at the present timeseems to be the unrest among the French State employees. Theywere awarded an augmentation of salary fast July, but they are not likely to get it until next March. Should they decide to take actionto improve their condition it is quite possible that the ConfederationGenerale du Travail would join them in a general strike which wouldbe extremely embarrassing for the Government. In this connection the recent decision of the School Teachers&apos; Friendly Societies totransform themselves into Unions and to seek affiliation with the confederation Generale du Travail should be noted, as the adhesionof this large body of public servants, numbering 20,000, to an organisation with the political doctrines of the ConfederationGenerale du Travail cannot fail to have a considerable influence uponthe education of the rising generation in France.Belgium. The new Cabinet presided over by M. Delacroix isgenerally approved by public opinion. As regards the languagedifficulty, it seems probable that in the future candidates for adminsitrative posts will be obliged to qualify in both French andFlemish. There is a general desire for an alliance with GreatBritain and France.The Miners&apos; Strike in the Charleroi district, which was supportedby the Jeune Garde Socialiste and the Confederation des Combattants,but which was discouraged by the men&apos;s leaders, was terminated bya compromise arranged by an Arbitration Committee presided overby the Director of Mines on the 21st December..The arrest of Jamar, the newly-elected Socialist deputy forAntwerp, and of two other labour leaders who were accused ofspreading Defeatist propaganda during the war, led to a short general strike in Antwerp. This strike is said to have been organized byCamille Huysmanns, who was anxious to prevent legal proceedingsbeing taken against Jamar, as he feared possible revelations at the trial of the part played by him in the production of the SocialisteBeige,&quot; the Defeatist organ published by him during the war.It is reported that the moulders of a certain Belgian firm, whowere all Trade Unionists, recently refused to produce certain fittingsrequired by an English firm. This would appear to be almost thefirst evidence of the existence of any international solidarity amongworking men belonging to a similar trade. Possibly the reason forthis unwonted fellow-feeling may be due to the fact that some ofthese Belgian moulders may have been in England during the war.It is known that many Belgian workmen became ardent trade unionists while in this country.
2 % 3The newspaper &quot; L&apos;Art Libre,&quot; which now appears fortnightly,is the organ of intellectual Bolshevism in Belgium, Holland, andFrance. It is financed by Bernard Mayer, a wealthy Jewish businessman in Brussels, who during the war was a strong financial supporterof Jewish and Anarchist organizations.The Belgian authorities have been carefully watching the extremist movement in Belgium during the last few months. the extremists propose to establish the inevitable dictatorship of theProletariat, but so far it seems that they have failed to interest theProletariat in their aims, and they appear also to be short of funds.Secret meetings have been held under the presidency of a Belgian ofthe name of (Jordier, whose plan of action was to effect a union withthe French Association Republicaine des Anciens Combattants. Sofar no such union has been arranged.Switzerland. It has been decided to postpone the Conferenceof Independent Socialist Parties in Europe, which the Central Com-mitteeof the Independent Socialist Party proposed to hold at Geneva in February, until July. The object of the Conference is to foundan efficient Labour International, as there have been differences ofopinion within both the Second and Third Internationals. The SwissSocialist Democratic Party is reported to have taken the initiativefor the re-establishment of the Second International or of some other international to take its place (see also under Germany).The attitude of the Swiss Socialists and that of the GermanIndependents (see under Germany) would appear to indicate thatthere is some desire among the less violent Socialists for some new form of International, the programme of wliich should be a corn-promise between that of the Second International and that of theThird.The notorious Swiss Bolshevik, Flatten, appears to have addressedthe assembly at the Seventh All-Russian Congress of Soviets onbehalf of the Swiss Communists. The rumour of his death as theresult of crashing in an aeroplane while travelling from Moscow toTashkent would appear, therefore, to be unfounded. From a state-inent published in &quot; La Sentinelle &quot; in December by Graber, the leader of the Swiea Socialist Party, the programme of the Party hasbeen modified and violent revolution is not one of its planks.The Committee of the Pan-Islamic League at Geneva has been strengthened by the arrival of the Tartar delegate, MourtouzaKhesameth, who has travelled from Moscow via Roumania.&quot; La Feuille,&quot; John de Kay&apos;s organ, has recently published a more. than usually virulent article against alleged British oppression inIndia, Egypt, and Ireland.A Congress of International Socialist and Communist Studentswas held at Geneva a short time ago, which was attended bydelegates from Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Austria,Jugo-Slavia, Holland, Belgium, and Switzerland. A split occurred in the Congress with regard to adhesion to the Third International.The Communist section of the Congress has joined forces with theInternational Youug Socialist Movement, while the,anti-Communistsection has set up an independent organization for any Socialists whoare opposed to Bolshevism.
Germany.-In the course of an interview in December jDr. Kreuter, Director of the Economic Department, stated that there was a distinct change of feeling among the people in favour of the INationalists.    This did not necessarily imply a Hohenzollern Irestoration, which would not be popular, but a Nationalist Republic, Iwith Hindenburg possibly as President.   Colonel Bauer, a prominent Imember of the Monarchical Party, is reported to have said that his party aimed at the restoration of a monarchy on the British pattern,   \and that its programme included the election of Hindenburg as president at the next election.  The question of the restoration ofthe monarchy would then be submitted to a plebiscite.   Only a fewhotheads, according to Colonel Bauer, dreamed of restoring the monarchy by force.   In Southern Germany there is propaganda in Ifavour of the establishment of a South German kingdom, the crown Iof which would be offered to a Hapsburg.   This movement is being organised by Bavarian Catholics, who are concentrating their efforts Iagaingst Bolshevism.   There is evidence to prove that the japanese are in close touch with the Monarchist movement in Germany.Reports as to the position of the present Government in Germanyvary, but there are signs that Noske&apos;s position is becoming less j&quot;istrong, and it is possible that the elections will result in gains for the [ iNationalists and Independent Socialists, and in heavy losses for the 1Democratic Party and the Majority Socialists.The Communists in Germany, of whom the Communists in HHamburg are the most powerful, seem to be quarrelling among f-ithemselves, but the Independent Socialists are increasing in strength, jand are reported to have gained the sympathy of many of the Trade -Union leaders.  At a recent congress of the Independent Socialists itis interesting to note that Fries, the Cologne delegate, paid a tribute to the freedom enjoyed under British occupation, and suggested thatthere was more liberty in Cologne than under Noske&apos;s regime.The forgeries of German bank notes are reported to have beenenormous; it is said that no less than 250 clerks are employed in the &apos;lieichsbank continuously upon the examination of notes, and that jenormous issues of paper money are necessary to replace the forgeries.The Independents rejected  a  programme of  unconditionaladherence to the Third International at the recent conference at   ;Leipzig; but, in order to avoid a split in the solidarity of the Left   jWing Socialist Parties, a compromise resolution was passed which,although not openly declaring for the Third International, was 1distinctly in favour of a Communist regime. According to documents which have been found by the Lithuanian authorities, it is clear that 1the Independents in Germany were in touch with Moscow, and that jnegotiations were in progress between the Party and the GermanGovernment for a representative of the Party to go to Russia,ostensibly for the purpose of re-establishing trade relations.   Theindustrial situation in Germany is improving, and there seems to be Ban inclination to work, and not to strike.   The German MetalWorkers&apos; Union has sent a circular letter to all their district offices,giving warning against decisions for striking, and advising thesettlement of wage disputes by negotiation.   The workmen of all the great wharves in Hamburg have decided to return to the pieceworksystem, as they realise that without it the output capacity of the
wharves cannot be increased to the extent which is necessary in theinterest of German production. There is evidence that the germans are trying to break down the high prices, more particularly those for american goods, by refusing to take goods which are now stored atEotterdam until their cost has been reduced. They argue that theyhave done without many of the articles during the war, and areprepared to continue to do without them until they are cheaper.The present policy of the Inter-Allied Commission in refusing toallow the Customs Duties in the Occupied Territories to be paid ingold or the equivalent of gold at the time, is said to be shutting off from the German Government one of its most necessary sources of income.It is reliably reported that the Government have been obliged to print 6 or 7 millions of marks a day to replace counterfeit money which is being secretly printed by Sparticist Associations. Forty-fivedifferent kinds of forgery have already been discovered by a specialstaff at the Beicfobank which is dealing with the question. TheGerman Government finds itself unable to repudiate this counterfeitmoney for fear of the panic which may ensue among the Germanpeople.Austria. At the Congress of the Austrian Communist Party,which took place at Vienna on the 7th-8th December, only about200 delegates attended, and the tone of the meeting was one of depression and discord. (The Party has been reproached by the Central Committee at moscow for its inactivity. It is stated that several representatives from this Committee have been sent with funds to try and strengthen the Bolshevik movement in Austria, and that a specialcourier service exists from Russia to Austria via Bodenbach inGermany, Berlin, and Norway. In spite of these efforts, however,Vienna seems to have become a centre of secondary importance sofar as the Bolshevik movement is concerned, and the AustrianExtremists&quot; are meeting with considerable opposition from theSocialists.Professor Adler. who, on the motion of Trotsky, was recentlyexcluded from his honorary membership of &quot; The All-RussianCentral Executive Committee of Soviets,&quot; has published an openletter to Trotsky in &quot; The Kampf,&quot; in which he criticises the policy:of the Russian Soviet Government in Austria. He complains thatwhen the Moscow authorities provided money for the furtherance of communism in Austria they failed to provide political commonsense, with the result that it was not so much a question of a partylooking for money, as of money looking for a party.The Monarchist propaganda continues in Austria. It is mainlyconducted by senior ex-officers at Gratz, who seem to be wellprovided with funds.Hungary. The Monarchists appear to be extremely active in hungary, and, in reply to a Royalist deputation, the new PrimeMinister stated that he proudly confessed that he himself was aRoyalist, and that he was certain that a great majority of the people would declare for a Monarchy if a plebiscite were taken. The aims of the Hungarian counter-Revolutionaries are said to include, h\[2023] B 3
addition to the restoration of a Monarchy, the recovery of Slovakiaand the Banat.1 The Small Landowners&apos; Party has now become a political group of considerable importance in Hungary. The Party came into existence during the Karolyi regime, when a certain number of bigestates were split up into small holdings and given to the peasants.These small landowners, who are anti-Hapsburg, were bitterlyopposed to Bela K.uu&apos;s communistic experiments and foundFriedrich&apos;s policy too reactionary. The Party now appears to have found a capable leader in Szabo de Sokoropatka, and, as it is strong and united, may play a prominent part in the General Election thismonth.A Communist plot to blow up the army headquarters and thePrime Minister^ residence and to re-establish a Soviet regime was recently discovered at Budapest. Large quantities of arms andammunition had been distributed among the Extremists, and it isstated that there is evidence to prove that the plot was financed from funds emanating from Moscow. Ladislaus Szamuely, brotherof Bela Kun&apos;s adherent, Tibor Szamuely, and many others have been arrested as promoters of the plot.Italy. There is a general feeling that another General Electionmay be expected within a comparatively short time, when Triesteand the Trentino will be included in the electorate. It is anticipatedthat the former district would return a Socialist and the latter aClerical majority. Signor Mtti at present cannot obtain a workingmajority in the Chamber without the support of the Catholic Party,and he is not likely to retain this support unless he offers places inhis Government to that party.The middle classes in Italy are said to be beginning to realizethat they made a mistake in not taking a more active part in therecent elections, and there is evidence of a general reaction againstSocialism. The Socialist leaders probably appreciate the situation,and are becoming more moderate in their tone. There is no moretalk of an immediate revolution, although a great deal of propaganda is going on throughout the country. It is also reported that Socialist&quot;Red Guards&quot; have been formed, who act as a bodyguard to the extremist leaders at political demonstrations, and are employed to provoke riots and to go on picket duty at strikes. It is worthy ofnote that in Italy the Socialists, although as a rule they are anti-Clerical, are being careful not to outrage in any way Catholicsusceptibility. The Reformist Socialists under Bissolati and Bonomihave assumed the title of Autonomous Socialists, and a DemocraticLiberal group of about eighty deputies, including some Giolittians, isin process of formation.In spite of the fact that the Socialist Party voted for the ThirdInternational, there seems little likelihood of Bolshevism spreadingto Italy for. the present. The Extremists are in the minority, andthe fact that so many of them have succeeded in getting into theChamber has probably weakened their hold over the populace. the story of the Italian workman who is said to have complained that hewas still obliged to work although it was two weeks since theSocialist deputies had been elected is probably typical of the pre-vailing disillusionment. The Patriotic Revolutionaries are also reported- to have lost popularity with the working classes,
The Soviet Government in Eussia has proposed the immediateresumption of relations with Italy, pointing out that the recaptureby the Bolsheviks of the Black Sea coast makes this possible.,D&apos;Annunzio has become exceedingly unpopular at Fiume, whereit is reported that everyone is longing to see the last of him and hisArditi, although no one dares to say so openly. The poet&apos;s connec-tion with the Patriotic Revolutionaries seems superficial, and he issaid to have received almost all his funds from the Freemasons.It is reported that Germany is making determined efforts to cometo a new political agreement with Italy. Giolitti is probably theleading pro-German politician, and Prince Bulow, who is his personalfriend, is expected shortly to return to Italy. German commercialtravellers are said to be swarming over the country.A telegram from Rome states that strikes have broken out on therailway at Rimini, Turin, and other places. The Government regardsthe situation as serious.Greece. Everything is reported quiet at Athens. There areno strikes and there is no evidence of Bolshevism.So far investigations with regard to the recent Oonstantitrist plotin Greece show that the movement was arranged in Switzerland andthat a certain amount of propaganda was carried on in the Provinces,but with little success. The plot appears to have been entirelymilitary and to have depended upon success in the murder ofVenizelos. It was intended to kill that statesman whilst in Italy,and, upon the receipt of the news in Athens, a rising in favour of ex-King Constantine was to have taken place.Roumania. It is reported that under cover of anti-Bolshevik propaganda the Government is in reality carrying out a movementagainst the Jews.Czecho-Slcwakia. The Separatist movement in Slovakiaappears to be gaining ground and has found expression in smallsporadic revolts, for which the causes have been either the requisi-tioniug of property, food, and money, or the employment by theGovernment of Czechs instead of Hungarian or German officials. the czechs are beginning to realise the seriousness of the position andhave in consequence proposed certain conciliatory measures. Thepopulation of Slovakia consists of three races : First, the Slovakiansproper, who form the bulk of the population; they are mainlypeasants who are deeply religious and show little or no interest inBolshevism. Secondly, the Magyars, who constitute about a third ofthe population and whose sympathies are entirely Hungarian; theyare Royalist, anti-Semitic, and are anxious to unite with Hungary.Thirdly, the Germans, who are also Royalists, but whose tendency istowards a union with Austria. President Masaryk and the Govern-meut appear to have lost much of the popularity which they formerlyenjoyed, but the position of Benes, Minister for Foreign Affairs, issaid to be strong. He is practically the only man in the Governmentfor whom the aristocracy say a good word.At a meeting of the Czecho-Slovakian Socialist Democratic Partyheld at Komotan, Kohl, who is known to have Bolshevik sympathies,declared that the time had arrived for the Party to join the ThirdInternational.[2023] B 4
JugO-Slavia. There is evidence of a strong movement infavour of autonomy in Croatia, It is reported that there exists inVienna a Croatian Committee in toucli with the Italians who are believed to be mainly responsible for financing the movement. It ispossible that, as Italy obviously fears a Jugo-Slav bloc, she is doingher best to assist in the formation of small autonomous States on theshores of the Adriatic. Dr. Frank and Dr. Raclicz appear to be theleaders of the Croatian movement. They are said to be extremelyable men and to have influence with the populace. They areRepublicans and pro-Hungarian in their sympathies.A strong anti-Jewish movement exists in Jugo-Slavia at present,and many Jews who have been long resident in the country are beingexpelled.Poland. In spite of his resignation, Paderewski appears toretain his popularity.No reply has been sent by the Government to the Russian soviet governments offer of peace.There is reason to believe that the arrest of the whole of theExecutive Committee of the Communist Party, numbering fourteenpersons, has considerably disorganised the activities of the Bolsheviksin Poland. There has, at any rate, been a decrease in Bolshevik propaganda.A report from Lodz states that three Polish battalions desertedon the 21st November when ordered to fight against the Bolsheviks.The combined Polish-Lettish offensive which has resulted in the capture of Dvinsk tends, however, to show that the moral of thePolish army is better than was supposed.The Government is said to be surveying the position of the jews in Poland, and to be anxious to act justly towards them. Only about15 per cent, of the population of Poland is Jewish, and there appearsto be as many as nine different groups among the Jews, four of whichare in favour of autonomy for the Jews within Poland, while themajority of the remainder are Zionists.Russia. It is reported that Litvinoff during his stay in Copen-hagen has been carrying on a vigorous commercial propaganda.   Heis said to have promised concessions to all the Swedish bankers andto many Swedish and Danish firms, and to have undertaken that allSwedish financial claims on Russia shall be honoured.  His attempt,however, to sell Chinese Loan of 1913 to the value of 1,000,000 crownsfailed as the banks refused to buy it.  In connection with Litvinoff&apos;commercial activities, it is interesting to note that the &quot;Isvestia&quot; ina recent number proposed an offensive movement against Murmanskin order to open up commercial relations with Scandinavia, thus to acertain extent breaking down the present blockade.  The Red troops on the Murmansk front have also recently been reinforced.Lenin, Trotsky, Zinovieff, Kameneff, Kagusovitch and Bukharinare the most prominent Bolsheviks who were elected to the Presi-dential Body at the seventh AU-Russian Congress of Soviets at moscow. Almost all the members elected to the AU-Russian CentralExecutive, Committee and the great majority of the candidates for election were Communists,
The First Conference of Proletarian Authors, under the honoraryPresidency of Gorki, Lunacharski and Zinovieff was recently openedat Petrograd. Evdokiroff greeted the assembled authors in the nameof the Petrograd Soviet, and in the course of his speech said&quot; TheProletariat must learn to conduct public affairs; it must also possessitself of spiritual culture. We have much to learn before we candefinitely decide what of the old culture should be retained and what should be rejected as useless. This Conference and its successors willlay the foundation of a new Communist culture and will help to change the life of man into a really beautiful and hninan existence.. . . . The fight against the bourgeois poison .... will have to becontinued for a long time yet.&quot;Bolshevik propaganda continues as active as ever and no efforts are being spared to influence public opinion in Europe and the UnitedStates in favour of coming to terms with the Soviet Government.According to one of the official organs of the Communist Party inPetrograd, Russian workmen in that city are doing extra work onSaturdays without pay in order that the money which they would otherwise receive may be devoted to Bolshevik propaganda abroad.The Commune of Petrograd is stated to have appealed to all otherCommunes in Russia to follow this example. It is not stated whatthe response has been to the appeal. An organization named &quot; Yuka,&quot;based on the Boy Scouts&apos; scheme, has been formed by the Bolsheviks,and units of this force are now attached to the Red Armies in thefield. The Orient Department of the Commissariat for Foreign affairs in Soviet Russia has sent a mission to Germany, consisting of Ali SaidEd-Djafer, a Persian Nationalist, and Rechid Niasy Bey, a Pan-Islamist, to discuss with Mohammedans at Berlin a project for holding Mohammedan Congress somewhere in Europe. Arrangements are reported to be being made in Moscow for the opening of an OrientalInstitute for training Soviet Orientalists in the political questions ofthe East.The Bolsheviks appear to be endeavouring to overcome theopposition of the Orthodox Church by engineering a schism amongthe clergy and founding a new Russian Free Peopled Church.Vladimir, Archbishop of Penza, is said to be at the head of this NewChurch and to have declared himself opposed to the PatriarchTikhon. The New Church proposes to instruct the masses in respectof all measures taken by the Soviet Government, to work in close co-operation with the Soviet Government, and to carry on a campaign against the old traditions of the reactionary Church. The leaders ofthe movement also express their intention of restoring in its puritythe Christian and Jewish Gospel which has been perverted by the heads of the Church.According to a statement of an officer who has recently returned from Petrograd, the Patriarch Tikhon still maintains his formernegative attitude towards the Soviet Government.As a proof of the close attention which Lenin is paying to thepolitical developments in Great Britain, a statement which appeared in a Moscow paper is worthy of attention. In reply to a letter froma leading English Communist asking for advice on the politicalstrategy of the Party in England, Lenin wrote on the 30th ofAugust, 1919, that he considered it was a mistake for the Communist
Party to refuse to participate in Parliamentary Elections. If, how-ever, no agreement could be arrived at on this point, it would bebetter, in his opinion, to accept this mistake rather than to postpone the formation of a strong Communist Party in England. On theother hand, if, despite all efforts, combination was found impossible,two Communist Parties should be formed which should work for the transition of Bourgeois Parliamentarism to Soviet rule, as a usefulstep forward.The Soviet Government has sent a wireless message to theGovernments of Georgia and Azerbaijan containing proposals for a union between those countries and the Soviet Government of Russiawith a view to united action against Denikin.On the other hand, a strongly reaclionary Party is said to havebeen formed in Georgia. This Party is mainly composed from thearistocracy.Baltic States. A Bolshevik plot, which emanated from moscow, was recently discovered at Riga. It had for its object the overthrow of the Government and the establishment by force of a soviet regime. Several Bolshevik agents were arrested, one of whomwas in possession of a letter addressed by Bukharin, Chairman of theExecutive Committee of the Communist International, to a Bolshevikorganization in the United States of America. This agent also haddiamonds, valued locally at 500,000 roubles, hidden in the soles of hisboots, and a large quantity of paper money.The pro-German Generals in his army have now been dismissedby General Yudenitch, and in consequence it is reported that theGermans are looking round for some new way of maintaining their influence in the Baltic Provinces. For this purpose they areemploying the services of an ex-officer of the Finnish Army, GenerafVassilkovsky. It is intended that Vassilkovsky, with the assistanceof Balahovitch, should form the nucleus of a new Russian armed forcein White Russia, which the Germans have undertaken to supportwith arms, ammunition, equipment, and the assistance of their political organisations. It is proposed to find the necessary officers for this force from among the Germans who have been training theFinnish Army and from the Finnish Jaegars.Vassilkovsky recently stated that he intended to apply to theEntente for assistance, but that if this assistance were refused hewould apply to the Germans. He is said to have about 25,000 mendispersed over Latvia and Poland. His eventual aim is to raise a force of 100,000, which will operate in White Russia and possiblyagainst Moscow. Vassilkovsky appears to be an adventurer andprobably a tool of German intrigue.Finland. The general tendency of public opinion in Finland doesnot seem to be in favour of the conclusion of peace with Soviet Russia.Although Colonel Brumer, of the Finnish General Staff, stated com-paratively recently that the preparations for an offensive againstPetrograd were still being continued, it is fairly certain that no suchmilitary intervention is probable so long as the present Governmentremains in power. Meanwhile, there are unconfirmed rumours of a bolshevik rising in Finland, and considerable Bolshevik propaganda is being carried on among the troops in the Finnish regular army
and also among the members of the Sehutz Corps (see DecemberReport). This propaganda will probably gather strength as a resultof the passing of the Amnesty Bill, which involves the release fromprison of 3,000 lied prisoners, of whom 1,600 are well-known agitators.The Monarchist movement in Finland, the object of which is tooverthrow the present Government, is said to have been started bythe Swede-Finnish element, hut the German and Russian Monarchistsare reported to be implicated in the movement. Its adherents, whoare said already to number 30,000, are mainly drawn from the Armyand the Police, and it is alleged that the Governor of Viborg,Hacksell, is one of its supporters. The Government apparently doesnot view tne growth of the movement with any anxiety.. The toneof politicians on the Right is becoming more than ever pro-German;in the Centre the sympathy with Germany is less pronounced, andon the Left opinion is said to be in favour of the Entente. german propaganda is, active in Finland; it is strongly supported by theChurch.The Social Democratic Party in Finland, which is much inlluencedby the action of British Independent Labour Party, up to the present :- time appears to be working entirely on parliamentary lines; it isfirmly opposed to Communistic methods, and has affiliated itself withthe Second International. The Finnish Socialistic Congress recentlydecided by 94 to 5t votes to exclude from the Party Luoto, theBolshevik journalist, and carried a resolution condemning acts of terrorism. ^Norway.&apos; In spite of the difference in their respective politicalcreeds, the Communists and Anarchists in Norway have united andhave formed a single organization which, it is estimated, has about30,000 members distributed over the country. This party contains the most active and intelligent elements of labour, and must beconsidered dangerous, as it is in touch with the Extremists throughoutthe world and acts under instructions from Moscow.Bolshevism, however, does not appear to be gaining ground ins Norway, although undoubtedly great efforts are being made from; Moscow in the way of propaganda. The Norwegian Bolshevik,Tramel, stated at the Scandinavian Bolshevik Congress at Stockholmthat he had been promised 200,000 kr. from Moscow for thispurpose; - and Communist literature is arriving at Christiania mainly from Germany. The leaders of the Norwegian Extremists arecontemplating the establishment of a Socialist Party bookstall for! the sale of Bolshevik literature.There is a great desire for an anti-Communist union of all classesto fight the revolutionaries. The authorities are also taking strongmeasures to counteract Bolshevism. Most of the Russian Jews,with no settled work, many Germans, and some Dutch and swedish subjects have been ordered to report to the police, and some have been instructed to leave Christiania. A rigid postal censorshiphas been inaugurated.The recent municipal elections in Norway resulted in a decrease!of the Socialist vote and a marked increase in the Conservative vote.This was especially noticeable at Trondhjem, formerly the chiefstronghold of Bolshevism in Norway.
The Extreme Socialist, and also some of the Conservative, news-papers, have recently been carrying on mti-Entente and anti-british propaganda. Although there is no definite evidence, it is probablethat this agitation is the work of the small but extremely bitterpro-German clique in Norway. German influence is largely Clericaland Educational, as many of the professors of the Universityreceived their education in Germany. This form of propaganda,however, has little influence on the people as a whole, who remainpro-British.Sweden. A Congress of Scandinavian Workmen was held at stockholm from the 8th to the 12th December, at which werepresent 269 .representatives of the Scandinavian Socialist Parties andof the Extreme Left of the Syndicalist Trades Unions. Althoughresolutions were passed in favour of indirect support for the russian soviet Republic and recommending sabotage in labour disputes, thegeneral opinion of the Socialist Press seems to be that the conference has resulted in a defeat for the Extremists.It is reported that Hoglund, editor of the &quot;Politiken&quot; and one ofthe Swedish Bolshevik leaders, has secretly visited Copenhagen andconferred with Litvinoff and returned to Sweden with a supply of propaganda. There is also evidence to show that a courier from moscow will shortly arrive in Stockholm carrying correspondencefor the Extremists in Erance and Italy. Strom is to get in touchwith this courier and to provide him with a Scandinavian passportto enable him to travel to Switzerland.A report from Stockholm states that William Munzenburg, the leader of the Young Socialist International Movement, has been arrested by the Police and is to be deported.What appears to be a General Strike began at Stockholm on the2nd January, and has now spread to almost every industrial centrethroughout the country. The strike is connected with the demandfor increased pay and the regulation of the new law for an eight-hours&apos; day.Denmark. The economic conditions in Denmark may be saidto be good as compared with the conditions which exist in central and Eastern Europe. It is unlikely therefore that Bolshevism willmake much progress in Denmark, although labour troubles may beexpected owing to the prevailing demand for higher rates of wages.It appears that Ernst Christiansen and a certain number of his followers (see December Report) have definitely joined the DanishBolsheviks. It is anticipated that their work will be conductedmainly outside Parliament by means of propaganda among theworking classes, and that they will attempt to reorganise the TradeUnions on Socialistic lines. As usual, the aim in view is thedictatorship of the Proletariat. Christiansen has been in touch withLitvinoff during the latter&apos;s stay at Copenhagen, and has obtained a promise of the support by the Russian Soviet Government of a weekly organ which he is issuing with the title &quot; Arbejdet.&quot;Further information has been received with regard to theorganisation which recently existed in Copenhagen for the falsificationof passports and visas (see Denmark, Report 14). Two of theleading spirits in this business were Reinicke, a German, and
Martin Hanson, a Dane. The former perpetrated the actual forgeriesat Hansen&apos;s house in Copenhagen, borrowing authentic passportsfrom German travellers and copying them by means of a hectograph.The passports thus fabricated were then supplied to the SlesvigVoters&apos; Association in Flensburg to be given to political refugees from Germany. These refugees were usually of the Sparticists ofthe lowest revolutionary type. According to the evidence of a mannamed Kramer, who was formerly a Commissar in Hungary underBela Kun&apos;s regime and who was connected with this traffic inpassports, there was a Central Bolshevik Bureau at Copenhagenfrom which Hansen obtained funds to assist the German fugitives.Kramer was arrested in Norway on his way to Russia with importantdocuments lor the Bolsheviks. Reinicke has been sentenced toeighteen months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour, and on completionof his sentence he is to be deported,It appears that Tchitcherin was anxious for Strom, the SwedishBolshevik, to get in touch with Litvinoff during the latter&apos;s visit to Copenhagen in order that he might do his utmost to induce the Danish Press to start a propaganda in favour of peace betweenSoviet Russia and Great Britain and the Baltic States. Strom wasprevented from journeying to Copenhagen by the Danish authorities.Holland. The working classes in Holland are reported to befollowing with close attention the Labour movement in GreatBritain, and to have come to the conclusion that their objects canbe better obtained by means of strikes and increased demands thanby open revolution. It is unlikely, therefore, that they will becomeaffected with Bolshevik ideas, which in Holland seem to be confined to the intellectual and artistic sections of the population. Sometime ago Wynkoop expressed his opinion that the ground in Hollandwas not suitable for . Bolshevik propaganda, and dismissed theBolshevik agents. There is evidence, however, to show that theyare returning.An incident in a meeting of the Town Conncil of Amsterdam atwhich a member of the Socialist Democratic Party accused one ofthe Communist members of trying to sell diamonds which he hadreceived from a doubtful source, tends to confirm reports which havebeen already received to the effect that there exists at Amsterdaman organisation through which funds in the form of diamonds arebeing sent from Soviet Russia to finance the revolutionary move-ments in other countries  bureau, called &quot; Soodienst,&quot; is said to exist in Holland whicharranges for the hiring of seamen for spreadiig Bolshevik propaganda in the Entente countries. A certain Jan Bohn is the head of this organisation. .   .In a personal letter to Hermann Miiller, the German Minister ofForeign Affairs, Troelstra has complained of the conduct of theGerman Minister at The Hague. He states that the GermanLegation is the centre of German Counter-Revolutionary Movement,and that the Minister is in constant touch with the ex-Kaiser.It has been reported that Fokker, the aviator, has brought out alarge number of aeroplanes from Germany and painted over theGerman marks, in contravention of the Armistice terms.   .
Spain. Spain is going through a very critical time. The fall of Senor Toca&apos;s Cabinet appears to have been almost entirely due tothe efforts of the &quot; Juntas,&quot; or Military Civil Protection Societies,which were originally instituted to assist the army to secure theremoval of&apos; certain notorious grievances, but which, have now become a considerable force in Spanish politics. They are said to be opposedto the present Government, in which the Minister of War, GeneralVillaba, is one of their strongest opponents.There is abundant evidence to show that the succession of strikesall over Spain and the very threatening position at Barcelona have all been engineered by the same agency; that German propagandahas been at work, as well as other alien elements. The lock-out at Barcelona is an attempt on the part of the employers to break the [Syndicates once and for all; more than a hundred employershave been assassinated, and the employers are convinced that if theleaders were removed the great bulk of the labourers would go backto work willingly; that they are deterred by terrorism only. Onthe 6th January the attempted assassination of the President ofthe Employers&apos; Federation, Senor Granpera, brought matters to ahead, and the Government has now intervened to some purpose;the Syndicates have been closed, more than a hundred leaders havebeen arrested, and the attempted mutiny of the troops at Saragossahas convinced the Government that they must extend repressivemeasures far beyond Barcelona. It is significant that? Angel Pestana,a man, of great ability who is believed to be behind most of the unrest, has disappeared.- It is now intended to deport from Spainall the dangerous foreign elements, whatever it may cost. Lettershave been intercepted indicating that a secret Soviet has been formed in Barcelona with an extensive programme of sabotage and murder.How far the Government measures will allay the disquiet remains tobe seen. At a meeting held in Madrid on the 13th December, the moderate Socialists gained a victory in so far that it was decidedthat the Spanish Socialists should not adhere to the Third Inter-national. The National Federation of Young Socialists in Spain hasaddressed a protest to the British Ambassador against the policy adopted by Great Britain towards the Russian Soviet Government.It is clear that matters cannot go on as they are if the stability of the country-which has been going through a time of greatprosperity is to be maintained. Perhaps the greatest need of all ismore sympathetic treatment on the part of the employers in thematter of wages and conditions.Portugal. The mass meeting of Trade Unions which was tohave been held in Lisbon on the 27th December, as a protest againstthe high cost of living, was stopped by the Government, which,however, permitted various clubs and unions to meet separately intheir own premises. These meetings passed off quietly. Bombs andarms had been discovered in the city by the police, which may haveaccounted for the Governments action.The Socialists had engineered the prohibited mass meeting, anda motion censuring the Government settlement of the crisis was presented by a Socialist Deputy on the 7th January. Subsequentlya vote of confidence for the present Government was only obtained
by a majority of twelve, arid the Prime Minister, Cardoso, conse-quently resigned with the rest of the Government, owing to the attitudeof the Opposition which, he stated, rendered the action of theGovernment impossible.The Bolsheviks who have been returned to Portugal as unde-sirables from South America (see December Report) are beingdeported to the Cape Verde Islands.Gibraltar. With the arrest of two Labour leaders, Gonzalesand Diaz, the agitation in favour of a coal strike at Gibraltar liasdeclined. There is definite evidence to show that Gonzales was inpossession of considerable sums of money, which he confessed to havingreceived from the German Consulate at Seville. His instructions were to stir up labour trouble in Gibraltar in order to paralyseindustry and divert shipping and trade from the British port.A further report states that the secretary of the coal heavers&apos;Union was offered by a German agent 2 pesetas a day for each of hismen for as long as the strike continued.Egypt. Except for the demonstrations of students in cairo and Alexandria, the arrival of Lord Milner&apos;s Commission passed off&apos;quietly, and the general strike which was organised in Cairo for the17th December, the anniversary of the Declaration of the BritishProtectorate in Egypt, was only partially successful. It is fairlyclear that the better-instructed Egyptian Nationalists fully appreciate that to boycott the Milner Mission is likely to prejudice their case,but they are fearful of publicly recognising it owing to the threats ofthe Extremists. This view is borne out by a more recent report thatsome of the more responsible Nationalist leaders, including an ex-Premier, have expressed their wish to accept Lord Milner&apos;invitation for a frank discussion without prejudice. Some of theNationalist leaders, especially the Pashas, no doubt are beginning torealise that, in inciting the Fellah to riot and rebellion, they arerisking the loss of their own farms. The desire for small holdingsamong the Egyptian peasantry has recently been increased by italian propaganda and also by the record cotton crop which is nowfetching enormous prices. If the Fellah were to become convincedthat those who cultivate the land should have an equal share init as a national right (and Islam rather encourages this simpleeconomic ideal), probably the leading Nationalist landowners, which include men of the type of Zaghloul Pasha, would not be so anxiousto get rid of British rule. There are persistent rumours that theItalian newspaper &quot; Avanti&quot; is supporting the Egyptian Nationalistmovement by propaganda, and is assisting the Egyptians inSwitzerland to communicate with their friends in Egypt. TheSecretary of the Italian Socialist Party is said to have promisedsupport to Egypt in her struggle for independence. This is confirmed by a violent anti-British speech delivered by SignorCiccorri, a newly-elected Socialist deputy, in the Italian Chamber,in which the deputy sent the greetings of his party to the peoples ofIreland and Egypt. The Catholic Party in Italy also appears to be interested in Egyptian independence. Monsignor Bonainti, the vatican correspondent of the &quot; Temps,&quot; who is assisted in his
anti-British campaign .by students at the Irish College in Rome,has recently published an article in his paper which, it was alleged,had been sent from Cairo advocating the cause of the EgyptianNationalists.The appeal to the &quot; Egyptian Nation,&quot; issued a few days ago bythe Committee of the Students, to refrain from acts of violence and sabotage is a satisfactory development.According to reports from Switzerland that German and Russianmoney has found its way into the hands of the Egyptian agitatorswithin the last few months, and that the money was distributed inSwitzerland.It is shortly proposed to publish an Egyptian Nationalistmagazine in Geneva, of which Bahrair and Kamel will be theeditors.Mesopotamia. The recent disturbances caused by Arabs inthe Middle Euphrates district are said to be connected with theintrigues of Enver Pasha and the Turkish Nationalists, who areactively engaged in propaganda in Trans-Caucasia and Anatolia.Turkey. There are indications that preparations are beingmade for the Pan-Islamic Congress at Sivas. Representatives of the afghans and the Hedjaz Arabs are expected to attend the Congress,at which an appeal will probably be made in the name of allMohammedans for fhe maintenance of the integrity of the ottoman empire.Pamphlets written by Kidwai, with a preface by MarmadukePickthall, which have been published by the Central Islamic Society,158, Fleet Street, London, are being circulated in Constantinople.The pamphlets contain Pan-Islamic and anti-British propaganda.The existence is reported of a factory at Constantinople for themanufacture of bombs, and it is believed that it may possibly be theintention of Talaat and his associates to establish a reign of terror.Syria. The situation in Syria is unsettled. Riots have occurredrecently in Damascus, following upon a report that the french troops were about to advance to districts which had not beengarrisoned by them. The Syrian Congress proclaimed the EmirFeisul as King over a United Syria, and his Chief of Staff was at thesame time nominated Governor-General. The deportation of thisofficial from Damascus by the order of Lord Allenby caused furtherdisturbances.Central Asia. The activities of the Afghans and Bolsheviksin Turkestan continue. The latter are reported to be bringing twoarmies, each of 75,000 men, with the object of forcing a revolution inthe East, beginning in Afghanistan and Persia. The Emir of Bokharaand the majority of his people are opposed to the Bolsheviks and arealso disinclined to have any dealings with the Afghans. In view ofthe Bolshevik successes, the Emir is in a difficult position, and atpresent is adopting a non-committal attitude. The Bolsheviks are apparently in some difficulty, in dealiug with the Emir, because, ifthey use force against him, they run the risk of alienating Moham-medan sympathy which they are endeavouring so persistently to
obtain. They are contemplating sending an ambassador to Bokhara.Meanwhile, the Afghans are reported to be secretly urging the Emirof Bokhara to hasten the organisation of his military forces, and are said to have offered to help him in arms and instructors.&apos; It is not considered likely that the Emir will accept this offer. On his arrival at Tashkent recently, the Afghan Envoy is reported to have made a speech in favour of the adoption of the Communist programme, andto have announced that the Afghan people had decided to marchhand-in-hand with the Bolsheviks. At a meeting held on the 24thof November at Tashkent by the &quot; Alliance for the Liberation of theEast,&quot; which was attended by the Afghan Consul and a number ofIndian revolutionaries, the tone of the speakers was entirely anti-British, and the Afghan officers in Russian Turkestan are engaged invigorous anti-British propaganda. It is believed that they are actingupon definite orders. According to a statement which appeared in aTashkent newspaper, Aslani Khan, the Afghan Consul-General, has declared that the Armistice between Afghanistan and Great britain is only temporary, and was arranged by the Afghans to enable themto gather in their harvest and to reorganize their army. As soon asthey are ready, the Afghans will insist upon Great Britain settingfree India, Persia and Baluchistan, and upon her returning to afghanistan all territories taken by her in previous war. In orderto guard against possible treachery on the part of Great Britain, he added that the Afghans proposed to maintain a firm alliance withBolshevik Russia.The Bolshevik propaganda in Turkestan and generally throughoutCentral Asia is being pushed with the utmost vigour. During thefirst half of December a special train for propaganda material was runto Tashkent. There is evidence that the Bolsheviks are extendingtheir wireless propaganda to Samarkand and Bokhara, and telegraphagencies have been established in both these towns. Lying reportsof an anti-British character are being circulated on all sides. In thisconnection it appears that Arsene Voznieeenski, a former official inthe Russian Foreign Office, who knows the East, has recently beensent on a special mission by the Bolsheviks to Central Asia. It isstated that he has successfully linked up the Bolshevik organisations of Teheran, Herat, Kabul, Tashkent and Samarkand, and that at thesame time he has made the necessary arrangements for the futurepassage of mails containing revolutionary correspondence which is tobe used for Bolshevik propaganda in India. Vozniecenski is also stated to have settled recent difficulties which had arisen betweenthe Soviets of Tashkent and Afghanistan.A report from Moscow states that a Persian Consulate has beenestablished at Arenburg.At the recent sitting of the Seventh All-Russian Congress ofSoviets, Sultan Gali was elected a member of the Presidential Bodyas representative of the Nations of the East.China. The reconstruction of the Chinese Cabinet has at fastbeen effected. The majority of its members have been nominated bythe military party which appears to be more powerful than ever. Itis frankly pro-Japanese, however, and the Government may thereforefind itself in difficulty owing to the Japanese boycott movement,
which seems to be gaining ground and is supported by the students and political&apos;societies throughout China. In a recent proclamationof the students at Shanghai war against Japan was advocated, andriots have taken place at that town, in which stores were raided and japanese goods burned.According to Chinese newspapers the Japanese boycott movement is being used as a means of formulating demands for an improvementin the conditions of labour in China, and efforts are being made toorganise a Labour Party. Although the conditions of the workingclasses are bad and there is a certain amount of Extremist agitation,it seems unlikely that Bolshevism will make much progress amongthe Chinese.There are indications that negotiations are in progress betweenChina and the Russian Soviet Government for the withdrawal of theChinese at present in Russia..Confirmation has been received with regard to the existence ofof the German Propaganda Bureau at Tsing-tau (see DecemberReport).Japan. According to statements in the Japanese press theBolsheviks in Japan are kept in ignorance as to the reasons for themaintenance of the Japanese forces in Siberia. The Conservatives in japan recognise that it is the right policy for Japan to preserve thepeace in the Far East, and that therefore the Japanese government cannot allow it to be disturbed by the Bolsheviks. It is also hopedthat Siberia will be an outlet for Japanese emigrants. The population is reported to be increasing by 600,000 to 700,000 annually.Labour demands in Japan are being conceded, and consequentlystrikes are decreasing in number. Japanesebusiness men have made such large profits during the last five years that they can afford topay larger wages than formerly.The Committee of the Japanese Communist group in the UnitedStates of America recently sent greetings to the Russian SovietGovernment, thanking the Bolsheviks for their help to the proletariatin Korea and Japan. Further demonstrations in favour of theindependence of Korea, held at Seoul on the 3rd December, were followed by many arrests. The Korean delegate at the meeting ofthe Ail-Russian Congress of Soviets, however, described JapaneseImperialism as only a buglkiar, and as unstable as the Entente in theWest.West Indies.Jamaica. The Legislature has sanctioned increases in the salaries of public officers, including teachers and police. On the15th December the police at Kingston went out on strike, but itshould be noted that no native sub-officer of the force absentedhimself from duty and the men returned to duty immediately afterthe Colonial Secretary had assured them that their grievances wouldbe considered.Strikes have occurred among&apos; the dock labourers and the motor-men and conductors on the electric tramcars. The Jamaica Federa-tion of Labour is now threatening a General Strike, and troops have
been brought into Kingston, where, owing to the Dock Strike, fifteenvessels are waiting to unload.Trinidad. The strike of stevedores in the Port of Spain inDecember is attributed to the work of agitators, included amongwhom are American negroes. During the first few days of Decemberthere were somewhat serious disturbances both at Port of Spain and.on the island of Tobago. The help of British marines had to becalled in, and two rioters were killed. The position became socritical that finally the Governor induced the shipping agents tomeet the representatives of the men and to come to an agreement.An advance of wages was conceded, and the stevedores returned towork. These concessions, however, appear to have led to demands and threats of violence from other workmen, and there is generalunrest throughout the Colony, where racial feeling, largely stirred upby returned soldiers, is acute. In order to avoid a racial riot theGovernor has obtained the assistance of n company of white troops.Australia. The Australian General Election resulted in thereturn to power of Mr. Hughes&apos;s party.The Labour Government of Queensland has brought in a Bill toprovide unemployment doles by means of an annual levy onemployers. If the Bill becomes law, which is considered probable,an employer will be called upon to pay a specified annual sum foreach of his employees. For the present year this sum is fixed at 2 per head, and it is hoped from the money thus raised to payable minimum dole of 17s. m. a week and a maximum of 35s. Thewoikmeifs leaders in Queensland believe that the institution of thislevy from the employers will prevent over-production in that theemployers will be compelled to pay for their own reserve of labourinstead of throwing the burden of unemployment upon the coin-munity as a whole.Strikes in Australia are still prevalent. The strike of the gas-workers in Melbourne caused many factories to slow down, and thestrike of the brewery employees at Sydney greatly aggrieved theworking classes as beer became scarce. The general strike of theAustralian marine engineers, which has recently broken out, haspractically brought inter-State shipping to a standstill.Mr. Judd, a Socialist candidate for the Senate, has been fined  5for describing Australian soldiers as &quot; six bob a day murderers,&quot; andMessrs. Fraser and Jenkinson, two printers in Melbourne, have been committed for trial on a charge of seditious libel in connection withthe publication of literature regarding the Irish Pace Conventionheld in Melbourne during November.New Zealand. The General Election has resulted in a victory for the Reform Party, but an analysis of the votes castshows that the Reform and Liberal votes have decreased by 47,000and 55,000 respectively, whereas the Labour vote has gained by91,000. A deputation of returned soldiers urged the Governmentto deport all interned Germans, and protested against the importa-tion and sale.of German goods.
South Africa. In a recent address to the Congress of theSouth African Party of the whole Union, General Smuts stated thatthere was a wide difference in principle between the policy of theSouth African Party and that of the Labour Party. He appealed forthe support of all moderate men.Owing to the opposition of the Federation of Trades to the exportof foodstuffs from South Africa, a dock strike broke out in CapeTown on the 17th December, and the Federation threatened a general strike unless the Government prohibited the export of foodstuffs.The coloured workmen in the railway goods yards joined the dockers,but the Strike Committee failed to obtain further support, and thestrike was called off.Strikes have occurred recently at some of the gold mines and alsoin Rhodesia, but they have been due to local causes, and the differences between employers and employed have been speedilysettled.It is interesting to find, in an interview with Mr. ArchieCrawford, who was formerly a &quot;firebrand&quot; in South Africa, how theInternational Labour Conference at Washington has worked uponthe minds of some of the delegates. He is strongly of opinion thatthe cause of the League of Nations has been advanced, and that theLabour movement may prove to be one of the most potent factors insupport of the League. He has also come back impressed with thefeeling that Labour enjoys a greater degree of liberty under theBritish flag than in any other part of the world. His influence, notonly in South Africa, but upon extreme Labour in this country,cannot but do good.Canada. The authorities are endeavouring to prevent the immigration of revolutionary Extremists from the United States.Montreal, which has a hirge foreign-born population, provides afertile soil for &quot;Red&quot; missionaries, and it is reported that quantitiesof &quot;Reel&quot; literature are being displayed and distributed in the factories and bookshops in the foreign quarter of the city.The conviction and sentence to two years&apos; imprisonment of R. B.Russell, the leader of the. Winnipeg Strike,lias aroused some excite-ment in Canada, and it is reported that organised Labour is restless.Alexander Ross, a former president of the Alberta Federation ofLabour and a consistent opponent of the One Big Union, advocateda forty-eight hours&apos; General Strike.as a protest against Russelfsconviction.Mexico. The crisis with the United States has subsided as a consequence of the release of Mr. Jenkins, and Senator Fall, whowas authorised by the American Senate to investigate Mexican affairs,has admitted that there is no longer any chance of his resolutionrequesting President Wilson to withdraw recognition of Carranzabeing carried. The Senator complains bitterly that Carranza realisesthat he can insult the United States with impunity and that the mexican Government has got,(to wash its hands in invisible &quot;water,roll its eyes upward and proclaim &apos; Peace on earth good-will tobandits.&apos;&quot;The Mexican Government is carrying on a vigorous ariti-american and pro German and Japanese propaganda in the press.    The
Q (i eyc o c,United States Of America.-The Government continues toshow a determined front, against the attempts of the Russian SovietGovernment to establish diplomatic relations with the UnitedStates.The wholesale arrest of agitators . by the authorities is being conducted with much vigour, and it is evident that a determined effort is being made to rid the country of the foreign Extremists.Many well-known leaders of the &quot; Industrial Workers of the World&quot;have been convicted under the provisions of the Espionage Law, andsentenced to periods of imprisonment varying from 3^ to 9f years.The investigations of the Lusk Committee with regard to theproceedings of the prominent Communists who were arrestedduring the recent raids continue, and the attention of theDepartment of Justice is being directed to the work of the Unionof Russian Workers which is recognised as a particularly dangerousorganisation. The authorities are also beginning to take notice ofthe &quot; Parlour Bolsheviks.&quot; the name given to those who, withoutnecessarily taking an active part in Bolshevik propaganda, provide.the agitators with money. The first of these persons to be servedwith a subpoena is Mrs. Rose Pastor Stokes, the mill hand who marrieda millionaire. During the war this lady was imprisoned for herpacifist activities. It is now alleged that she has subscribed100,000 dollars to the Communist movement. That public opinion is considerably roused against the Extremists is proved by the attacks which are being made in various parts of the country on the officials and premises of the &quot; Industrial Workers of the World.&quot;Possibly the severity of the measures taken against the Extremistsmay defeat their object, as it is reported that the &quot; industrial workers of the World &quot; organisation is gaining ground. Its directinggenius is said to be Vincent St. John, who is now attempting to raise a fund of over 1,000,000 dollars for the defence of the arrestedmembers of his Association. The &quot; Industrial Workers of the World &quot;organisation has now given its official support to the Russianlabouring classes are made to believe that all their troubles are dueto the greed of foreign capitalists, mainly America, and it is con-continually pointed out that the United States intend to annex central and Southern America It is reported that the Mexican SocialistParty has now become Communist and has adopted the programmeof the Third International. Lynn A. E. Gale, publisher of &quot; Gale&apos;sMagazine,&quot; Mexico City, is the leading member of the CommunistParty&apos;s Executive Committee. He was formerly a German agent inMexico and, together with the German propagandist group, is nowshowing active sympathy with Soviet Russia.The press reports that an &quot; army&quot; of German commercialtravellers is now in Mexico, and a Hamburg organisation is said tohave chartered sixteen ships for the transport of Germans and austrians to Mexico. Two thousand German officers and non-commissioned officers have reached Mexico with Spanish passports.In this connection, it is interesting to note that the Dutch Govern-nient has seized three wagon-loads of machine-guns which had reached Holland from Germany and were awaiting shipment toMexico.
Bolshevik revolution, and has expressed its desire to join the ThirdInternational. In an address recently delivered to a small audiencen Wales, where he is now on a lecture tour, Hardy, the general secretary of the &quot; Industrial Workers of the World,&quot; stated that theorganisation had a membership of 300,000 and a press circulation of twenty-two publications. It is clear that the American-bornCommunists are working in close touch with the various foreignExtremist associations which exist in the United States. Of these,the Union of Russian Workers, so many of whose members havebeen recently deported, is considered to out Bolshevik the Bolsheviks.The Union, which is reported to have enrolled more than 7,000members, was founded in New York in 1917, by a group of Russianrevolutionaries, of whom tho leader was William Szatow, now chiefof the police in Petrograd. Its press stands openly for the forcibleoverthrow of the United States Government.With reference to the report that Marten&apos;s Soviet Bureau was in communication with many firms in the United States which were disposed to open up business relations with Soviet Russia (seeDecember Report), it is interesting to note that the representatives ofsome of the firms concerned have denied that they have anyrelations with Martens. The Jewish &quot; Forward,&quot; however, maintainsthat two large firms, the names of which are not given, are ready to ship foodstuffs and other supplies to Russia to the value of15,000,000 dollars. The arrangements, according to &quot; Forward,&quot; arebeing made by Dudley Field Malone.The American Legion of Returned Soldiers has held its firstNational Convention, and passed some strong resolutions demandingthe deportation of alien slackers and interned enemy aliens, opposing the release of political prisoners, asking that Victor Berger&apos;scertificate of naturalisation might be withdrawn, and urging thatsummary treatment might be meted out to officials who were responsible for the &quot; tender treatment of alien conscientious objectors.&quot;The Convention&apos; also approved a scheme for universal militarytraining with a small standing army. It is reported that the communists are attempting to undermine the loyalty of the army bydirecting certain selected candidates to enlist for military service.Strikes still continue, but, except in cases where foreignextremists have succeeded in engineering trouble, the generalbehaviour of the strikers appears to be good. In the steel workers&apos;strike, which has now been officially called off, the men&apos;s relief work has been managed by Robert McKetcham, President of the CentralStates&apos; Wholesale Co-operative Association, and that the assistanceof .the Farmers&apos; Co-operative Organisation and that of the AmericanSociety of Equity and of the Co-operative Wholesale Society were also promised. In this connection the proposals which have beenmade that the co-operative societies in Great Britain should assistthe Triple Alliance in the event of a General Strike should be borne in mind.It is estimated that during the past year strikes have costLabour roughly 145,000,000/. and Capital over 253,000,000/. the monetary loss, it is reported, is greatest in the Middle West, whichis the centre of the foreign-born population and where the &quot; industrial workers of the World &quot; organization is strongest.   The Reconstruction
6 ci o)Conference, held by the American Federation of Labour in December,appears to have been a triumph for Mr. Gompers and the more moderate elements of the Labour Party. The Conference refused tosupport the newly-formed National Labour Party, and denounced the attempt to &quot;inject a spirit of Bolshevism into the affairs of theAmerican Federation of Labour.&quot; Resolutions were also passedendorsing the steel strike, condemning the injunction of the FederalCourt against the coal strike, attacking the anti-strike provisions inthe pending Railroad Bill, and urging Congress to keep the railwaysunder Government control.The Second Industrial Conference called together by PresidentWilson began its labours at Washington in December. The Presidenthas announced tentative recommendations made by the conference for the establishment of machinery to prevent or to retard labourconflicts. These recommendations include the creation of a national industrial Tribunal, together with regional boards, whose duties itwould be to try and effect the settlement of industrial disputes.The recommendations also lay down that the interruption of certainpublic services, such as the railway service, is intolerable, and thatthe attempt by any persons to provoke a strike of government employees is not permissible.The newly created National Labour Party has adopted an organisation modelled on the lines of the Socialists. It includes theelection of a National Committee, to which each state is to send twodelegates-a man and a woman. A monthly contribution of 2 cents,is to be levied on each member of the Party. The newspaper, &quot; TheNew Majority,&quot; of Illinois, lias been chosen as the Party&apos;s officialorgan. Robert M. Buck is its editor. Among the names of personsmentioned as the Party&apos;s candidate for the Presidency are those ofGlenn, Plumb, Lynn Frazier, and Eugene Debs.The Hearst press and the Irish-German element in the populationcontinues its vigorous anti-British propaganda. The &quot; New YorkAmerican,&quot; while acknowledging the ample apologies which havebeen made to the accident to Mr. &quot;Pussyfoot&quot; Johnson&apos;s eye, takes the opportunity of reminding its readers of the incident of Jenkins&apos;sear, which led to the Anglo-Spanish War in 1739.The Irish Roman Catholic priests in the United States are reported to be in close relationship with the foreign Extremists, whoseobject is to bring about a revolution in Great Britain. the lithuanian Clerical Labour Party, which is largely controlled by theJesuits, is connected with the Irish priests.Signs are not wanting that responsible politicians, belonging both to the Republican and Democratic Parties, are tired of De Valeria,and that their only interest in the Irish question is due to theiranxiety about the Irish vote at their own constituencies.Apparently De Valera was well received in his second tour of the pacific Coast, and was accorded an enthusiastic welcome upon his return to Washington on the 7th of January. He is believed tointend to remain in the United States until after the presidential election.The Ulster representatives have been well received in Phila-delphia, where the audiences cheered themselves hoarse as the speakers denounced the Sinn Feiners.
Evidence continues to be received which confirms the impression that the negro agitation is being carefully engineered by the&quot; Industrial Workers of the World &quot; organization. Among theprincipal directors of this agitation are William D. Hay ward andJames Ward, who is Secretary for the I.W.W. in Omaha and a closeadherent of Ludwig Martens of the Soviet Bureau. As a result ofthe spread of radical doctrines teaching social and sex equality amongnegroes, serious trouble is expected in Chicago and in Omaha, whereattacks on white women have recently been frequent. MeanwhileMarcus Garvey, in conjunction with the Universal Negro Improve-ment Association, continues to prepare the way for the universalawakening of the Negro race. Other coloured organizations are equally busy, including the Friends of Freedom for India. The&quot; New York News,&quot; whose editor, George W. Harris, is consideredanti-British, is supporting a policy of Africa under the Americanflag. The plan is for the former German Colonies to be taken overby the Americans as a promised land for tbeir educated colouredfellow-citizens. A negro, Joe T. Thomas, has written an eloquentpamphlet on the subject, and has already designed a flag for the newrepublic, which is to consist of 19 States. The flag is to have19 stripes, 7 of which are to be red to represent the blood of negroes,6 black to represent their colour, and 6 yellow to symbolise their&quot; undeveloped brain.&quot; The flag contains many other symbols,including a cage, to represent slavery, and &quot; 9 angles, which representthe 9 countries that have put our race before the world as a GodlyPeople.&quot;South America.In order to decide upon some form of united action against bolshevism, a Congress of Police Officials representing the variousSouth American Republics is shortly to be convened. The Corn-munists claim that their creed is spreading rapidly throughout theSouth American continent, and state that quantities of literary propa-ganda, mainly printed in Barcelona, have been brought into thecountry.Peru. The National Assembly called to approve the reformsin the Constitution, before adjourning on the 27th December, hassanctioned a law authorising the confiscation of sufficient of theproperties of the supporters of the recent rebellion to pay all thedamages and expenses caused by the rebellion.Venezuela. The development of the country is largelyhindered by the dearth of population, and the Government is anxiousto encourage immigration. A Committee which includes members ofthe American, German, Austrian, and Italian colonies has been formedto look into the subject. The Government wishes for immigrants ofthe artisan class, but is alive to the danger of introducing Bolshevismand has passed legislatiorr which it is hoped will enable a propercontrol of immigration to be maintained.The Argentine.-There have recently been considerablelabour disturbances in the Argentine which are directly traceable to
Extremist propaganda. The agitators are calling upon the workers to strike for a wage of  2 a day, and it is rumoured that a generalrevolutionary strike may be called for the 20th February. In suchan event the Government is reported to be in a better position totake strong measures than it was last year.A representative of the German newspaper, the &quot;DeutscherArgentinischer Centralverband,&quot; who was sent last summer to see what chances there were for German immigrants to the Argentine,has reported that such immigrants would be generally welcomedexcept by the Germans who are already there. The press representa-tive considers that this unbrotherly attitude is due to the &quot; narrow-minded views&quot; of the Argentine German, who looks upon himself asthe sitting tenant and upon every new German as a dangerouscompetitor.PART II.Industrial Conditions in Russia.The following notes on the Industrial conditions in Russia duringlast Summer were received in a report from Warsaw, dated the21st and 25th November, 1919 ;-1. Population of Petrograd (based on statistics based on food cards on the 1st September, 1919), 954,204. Adults, 690,571;children, 263,633. &apos;Monthly average of birth a during the period January to August1919, 8,095, and of deaths during the same period, 49,519.2. Fuel for MOSCOW.-Light railways were being laid downto enable wood to be brought from the various forests near the city.3. Podolsk Coal Mines.-The quality of coal is poor, 30 percent, containing 25 per cent, humidity. The coal is no longer sorted.Machinery taken from Archangel before the arrival of the allied troops is being used to work the mines. The output of coal wasonly 20 pouds of coal a day per man instead of 100 pouds as formerly.4. Tobacco Factories.-Sixty-eight factories have beennationalised, of which thirty-two were working in August. the stocks of tobacco then in store were estimated to last for three orfour months, by when the new crops would be ready for the factories.5. Locomotive Works.-Output during August :-Works.EnginesConsbrnofced.EnginesEepaired.PutilovNevskiBalticIjerski

[the goods manufactured by him ] 117Kolomna...J is 1^89 kopeksThe average figure is 116 roubles worth of manufactured goodsper 1 rouble wages. 16 kopeks are left, therefore, to cover the costof production.7. Chemical Industry.-One hundred and sixty chemical works have been nationalised, nineteen of which are large ones andtwenty-four of medium size. At the end of the summer most ofthese works had sufficient workmen. It was estimated that therewere sufficient raw materials to keep up the output for about five months. The stocks of fuel were not plentiful. Shortage of alcoholwas a great hindrance to the output. Attempts were being made toget sugar out of lignine. The sugar was to be worked up intoalcohol. Benzine was being produced out of the worst qualities ofpitch.8. Dye and Potash Producing Industry.-As it is absolutely impossible to get any dyestuffs in Bolshevik Russia,the Soviet Government^built a factory near Saratoff where ochreousclay is to be found. The factory cost about 40,000 roubles to buildand equip. It employs only ten workmen. During August58 pouds of ochre and 65 pouds of other dyes were produced. Apoud of dye cost 200 roubles.The Russian-Baltic chemical works at Saratoff have he-o&apos;un toproduce potash out of sunflower stalks.9. Textile Industry.-There were 7,793,000 spinning loomsand 190,000 weaving looms in Russia before the war. All the spinning factories and 80 per cent, of the weaving mills have beennationalised by the Bolsheviks. The following statistics are availableconcerning these mills: In 1917 there were 6,084,000 looms working, i.e., 76 per cent.In 1918 there were 5,858,000 looms working. i.e., 73 per cent.On the 1st July, 1919, there were 2,224,000 looms working,i.e., 28 per cent.The main cause for the great reduction in looms working wouldappear to be the lack of cotton wool. In November it was estimatedthat the output of the mills was only 6&apos;5 per cent, of their outputbefore the revolution in 1916. Already in August, 1918, 149 of the172 mills were at a standstill, and more than 328,000 workmen were out of employment.10. Zarajskaja Boot Factory (near Moscow).1919.

The failure of Admiral Koltchak&apos;s regime in siberia.Admiral Koltchak&apos;s recent collapse in Siberia may be attributed to his own weakness and the extreme reactionary tendencies of his supporters. The latter, among whom the most prominent areZlokazoff, Kliagin, Sinkevitch, Vinokouroff, and Sterelny, are, in reality, little short of a band of old regime officials, speculators, warprofiteers, and adventurers, whose ultimate aims are self-advancementand the re-establishment of a Monarchist regime. Corruption inGovernment offices is rife, and there is ample evidence to show that many of the leading officials have appropriated large sums of money for their own personal use. In this connection it is significant that neither the railway employees nor the officers of Koltchak&apos;s armyhave received any pay for several months.There is little reason to disbelieve in Admiral Koltchak&apos;s personalsincerity; but he has realised his mistakes too late, and in spite ofhis promises of reforms and the establishment of a Democraticregime there is little chance of his being able to recover his position,since he appears to have completely lost the confidence of the siberian people. It would be true to say that not 5 per cent, of the siberian population are prepared to support, Koltchak&apos;s regime.Reports which have been current to the effect that the people areinclined to favour the re-establishment of a monarchy in Russia are entirely without foundation. The Siberians are colonists, with allthe independent instincts of such people, and since long before theWar, or the Revolution, have always objected to being interfered with by Petrograd. The majority of the peasants are unable to reador write, but nevertheless they have a strong desire for freedom, theestablishment of a Constituent Assembly, and the dividing up of thelarge estates. The nearest approach to such a form of Governmentis contained in the programme of the Right Social Revolutionaries,who so far have not been given an opportunity of openly expressing their views, either under Koltchak&apos;s or the Bolshevik regime. Itseems probable, however, that whatever Government other than a bolshevik one succeeds that of Admiral Koltchak, it will have thegreatest difficulty in maintaining itself without foreign&apos; support,owing to the present general dissatisfaction which exists throughoutthe country.The following information, supplied by a correspondent who hasrecently returned from Siberia, gives a clear picture of the hopelessnature of events during the last six months: &quot; Indescribable chaosexists both among the Red and White forces, and it would bedifficult to say that either side has an army in the true sense of theword, or that any serious engagements have taken place.&quot; During their retirement, the demoralised White troops have committed indescribable excesses, and there is little doubt that insome cases they have almost rivalled those committed by theBolsheviks. The most noteworthy instances are connected with theactivities of Semenoff, Kalmikoff, Krasilnikoff, and General Rozanoff.It appears to be almost part of the White&apos;s programme to loot eachvillage before abandoning it to the mercies of the Bolsheviks; and atEkaterinberg, Koltchak&apos;s troops systematically pillaged the whole
town, after assassinating the sentries who were guarding the shops.All the stolen goods were sold quietly along the lines of communi-cation, but no efforts were-made by the authorities to suppress suchexcesses. Large numbers of refugees are continually passing to the rear, and those who remain behind are completely bewildered byconstant invasions, first by the Whites and then by the Eeds, both ofwhom shoot, torture, and hang. General Gaida, the late CzechCommander, and General Pepelaieff have openly stated that thegeneral demoralisation of the White forces is mainly due to the factthat they are entirely ignorant of the purposes for which they are engaged in Civil War.&quot;A correspondent describes the situation as &quot; the phantom army of a phantom Government fleeing distractedly before the phantom of another army.&quot;His majesty&apos;s Stationery Ofpici
