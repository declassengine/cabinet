Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.China/004MEMORANDUMonOUTER MONGOLIA AND THE CHINESE EXPEDITION OF 1919.\ -THE statement given to Reuter&apos;s correspondent at Peking by the Chinese ForeignOffice on the 30th November aspires to place before the world the history of theMongolian question from the foundation of the Manchu dynasty, with the object of explaining the origin and objects of the Chinese expedition of 1919 to Urga. TheChinese Government have rarely thought it necessary to lay bare publicly the reasonsfor a new departure in such detail, and of course their case is stated in their own way.To understand clearly what has happened, it may be as well to give a more detachedsketch of the principal events of the last decade.The Manchu regime. The autonomous state of Outer Mongolia dates from theChinese Revolution. Before that the country had little political history for over200 years.. Under the regime inaugurated by Kanghsi towards the close of theseventeenth century the higher government emanated from Peking, and the Mongolprincipalities were supervised by Ambans and military governors, generally Manchus,whose seats were at Urga, Uliasutai, and Kobdo. But these representatives of theChinese dominion rarely interfered in internal administration, which was left almostentirely to the hereditary Mongol chieftains, mostly descendants of Jinghis. TheChinese authority over a considerable portion of the country was largely maintainedthrough the head of the Mongol Church, the Lama Pope, known as the CheptsunDampa Khutukhtu, who is an avatar chosen as an infant by lot after the manner ofthe greater Lamaistic &quot; incarnations&quot; of Tibet. The present Khutukhtu is of Tibetanorigin.Mongol unrest in 1911. The system had worked with remarkable smoothnessduring nearly the whole of the Manchu dominion until the Younghusband expeditionto Tibet stirred the Peking Government to take a more active interest in the outerdependencies. While Chao Erh-f&amp;ng campaigned with large forces in West Szechwanand the Tibetan marches, less obvious attempts were made to tighten the control of theAmbans and to reduce the Mongolias more to the status of Chinese provinces. the steps taken to effect this were not conducted tactfully, especially in the reign ofHsiian-t&apos;jung (1908-1P), and the mistrust aroused amongst the Mongol leaders came toa head only a few months before the Chinese revolution broke out. In 1911 a barracksfor Chinese troops was begun at Urga; numbers of Chinese military officers arrived there;the immigration of Chinese traders and labourers was encouraged; and the Mongolprinces were taken to task for their relations with Russians. Urga now became ahotbed of conspiracy against Chinese rule, and in July 1911 there was a surreptitiousconference of Mongol chiefs at Urga, over which the Khutukhtu presided, to oppose the new Chinese policy. Largely at the instigation of Russian agents it was decidedto appeal to the Russian Government for protection. A deputation went secretly toSt. Petersburg, and shortly afterwards (28th August), the Russian Minister at Pekingaddressed a note to the Wai-wu Pu calling attention to the measures which werebeing taken in Mongolia, and warning the Chinese Government that Russia could not remain indifferent to any violent change in the status quo. The Chinese rejoinder(19th September) merely said that the measures of reform in progress were directedsolely to the commercial and industrial development of the country, and that the UrgaAmban had been instructed to pay regard to Mongol feeling.Declaration of Mongol Independence, December 1911. The revolution of October1911 gave the Mongol princes their opportunity,, The independence of Mongolia was declared ; the Amban was forced to withdraw; and the Khutukhtu was appointedGreat Khan of the Mongols (1st December). When appealed to for support Russiacounselled moderation and advised the Mongols to find a basis of agreement with the[1998] B(11497)
Chinese. But they were not disposed to listen at first. Attacks were made on Bargaand Manchuria, and early in 1912 Uliasutai was seized. There were dissensionsamongst the leaders, some favouring a union between Outer and Inner Mongolia in viewof their common religion; others clamouring to return to the old allegiance; and a third group urging the consolidation of Outer Mongolia as a separate entity. TheChinese Government took advantage of these divisions of opinion to counteract theindependence movement, and succeeded in inducing the Inner Mongol princes to adhere to the Republic, with the exception of a Khorchin djassak, whose lands are aroundTaonanfu and who raised a revolt in that area in August 1912. This rebellion wassuppressed quickly and with much severity by the Chinese.The Russo-Mongol Agreement, 1912. The Russian Government meanwhile was taking a hand in the matter. Russia had no serious designs on Mongolia; she had anabundance of undeveloped territory of greater potential value in Siberia to occupy herattention without including Mongolia in her colonial programme. But looking to thefuture she desired to keep the long Mongol-Siberian frontier in its existing state of weakness, and she bad strong&apos; objections to the garrisoning of North Mongolia withChinese troops which could constitute a menace to the slender line of communications with Priamuriya and Vladivostock. Apart from these considerations she was underengagements to respect the integrity of the Chinese dominions. A Russian envoy,M. Korostovetz, who had been Russian Minister at Peking, was sent to Urga, and heconcluded an agreement (21st October/3rd November, 1912) with the Khutukhtu&apos;sGovernment by which Russia undertook to help in maintaining Mongol independence and in keeping Chinese troops and colonists out of Mongolia: In a protocol annexed tothis agreement elaborate arrangements were made giving Russian subjects completeliberty of trade in Mongolia free of &quot; duties, taxes, or other dues&quot; and other special privileges.Mongol-Tibetan Treaty, 1913. This Russo-Mongol Agreement was immediatelyfollowed by a Mongol-Tibetan Treaty of Alliance, also concluded at Urga by repre-sentatives of the Dalai Lama and of the Khutukhtu (29th December, 1912/11th January, 1913), which, though of no political importance, is interesting from thefact that the initiative in the matter is said to have come from the Tibetan side.The readiness displayed by the Urga Government to accept the Dalai Lama&apos;s proposal was explained by the great moral and religious significance attached to the benedictionand approbation of the supreme head of the Lamaistic Church. To the Khutukhtu,who stood lower in the spiritual hierarchy, a proposal to conclude an agreement on equal terms could not but be flattering.The preamble of the treaty asserted that Mongolia and Tibet had freed themselves from the Manchu dominion and had become independent States, and that the newalliance was formed in view of the community of religion.   Both States recognised theother&apos;s independence, agreed to work together for the advancement of Buddhism and ,engaged to assist each other against external and internal dangers.Russo-Chinese Declaration, 1913. The Korostovetz Agreement was much resentedat Peking. Moreover, it seemed to be hardly consistent with the pledges of thePowers to maintain the integrity of the Chinese Empire. The matter was taken up with the Russian Government, and a declaration and exchange of notes followed(5tp.November, 1913), in which Russia recognised China&apos;s suzerainty, and thatOuter Mongolia formed part of the territory of China; while China recognised theautonomy of Outer Mongolia, and undertook not to. interfere in the internal administration, not to send troops there, and to abstain from all colonisation.Autonomous Outer Mongolia was loosely defined to include the regions which hadbeen under the jurisdiction of the Urga Amban, the Military Governor at Uliasutai,and the Kobdo Amban ; and provision was made for further negotiations in which the outer Mongol authorities should take part.Russo-Mongol Railway and Telegraph Agreement, 1914.--Following the arrange-ments of 1912 and 1913, railway and telegraph agreements were concluded between russia and Outer Mongolia on the 30th September, 1914. In the railway agreementRussia &quot; recognised the right of the Outer Mongols to construct railways in their own.territory&apos;&apos;; but the Mongols had to consult Russia before granting a concession to aprivate person, and if they wanted assistance to build railways they had to apply toRussia.
Tripartite Treaty of Kiakhta, 1915. It took some persuasion on the part ofRussia to induce the Khutukhtu&apos;s Government to negotiate on the basis of the PekingDeclaration, and it was not until September, 1.914, that the representatives of Russia,China, and Outer Mongolia met in conference at Kiakhta. The discussions wereprolonged, but an agreement was reached and recorded in the Tripartite Treaty ofKiakhta (7th June, 1915), which settled &quot;the various questions created by the new state of tilings in Outer Mongolia&quot; in considerable detail. Outer Mongolia adhered tothe Peking Declaration and exchange of Notes of the 5th November, 1913, and recognised the suzerainty of China ; and Russia and China recognised &quot; the autonomyof Outer Mongolia forming part of Chinese territory.&quot; But Outer Mongolia wasdenied the right to conclude international treaties with foreign Powers respectingpolitical and territorial questions ; she could only conclude such treaties if they werecommercial or industrial. Neither Russia nor China were to interfere in the internal administration, and the military escorts of Russian and Chinese representatives werestrictly circumscribed. Article 11 laid down the limits of Outer Mongolia to be &quot; the regions which were under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Amban at Urga, or the TartarGeneral at Uliasutai, and of the Chinese Amban at Kobdo, and connects with the boundary of China by the limits of the banners of the four aimaks of Khalkha and ofthe district of Kobdo, bounded by the district of Hulun-Bouire on the east, by InnerMongolia on the south, by the province of Sinkiang on the south-west, and by the districts of Altai on the west.&quot; A formal delimitation was to be carried out by acommission of Chinese, Russian, and Outer Mongol delegates, which should have set towork within two years from the date of the agreement. It does not appear that anyattempt was made in that period to carry out this provision.Russo-Chinese Agreement relating to Barga, 1915. The district of Hulun-Bouireabove referred to is otherwise known as the Bargut country, or Barga. It occupies thenorth-east corner of the territory usually marked as Mongolia on the maps, in thevicinity of the two lakes Kulun (Hulun) and Buir, and contains two important stationson the Chinese Eastern railway, Hailar and Manchuria. Since 1906 the Chinese hadbeen introducing changes in the administration to bring it into line with that of regulation Chinese province; but in 1911, when schools were instituted to teach thepeople Chinese, the Barguts took alarm, and a congress of their leaders demanded theremoval of Chinese officials and troops and the cessation of Chinese colonisation. TheChinese revolution soon afterwards enabled the Barguts to turn the Chinese out of theircountry. According to Russian reports, the Barguts now applied to be annexed by russia, but, looking to the fact that Barga was considered to be Chinese territory, thelatter recommended an arrangement with China. This advice was not taken. Instead,on the proposition of the Barguts themselves, Barga was made part of the Khutukhtu&apos;snew State, and a leading Bargut was installed at Hailar as the Khutukhtu&apos;s Viceroy.After the Kiakhta Treaty was signed, Russia and China concluded anotherarrangement (26th November, 1915) &quot;on the subject of the Houlounbouir situation.&quot;By this Barga became &quot; a district under the control of the Central Government of theChinese Republic.&quot; The Governor, a Bargut, is appointed by the President, and wieldsthe powers of a provincial governor. China is entitled to send troops there &quot;in case of disorder&quot; on giving notice beforehand to Russia, and the troops must be withdrawnwhen order is restored. The effect of this arrangement was to remove Barga from Urgacontrol, and to restore the old Chinese connection, but also to bring it under the special protection of Russia.Japan and Mongolia. Japan did not figure noticeably in questions affectingMongolia until the appearance of the famous Twenty-one Demands, which were presented to China on the 18th January, 1915. Before that, in 1907 and 1912, therehad been secret arrangements between Japan and Russia which defined their respectivespheres of interest, and according to these arrangements a portion of East Mongolia fell within the Japanese sphere. The claims thus foreshadowed were advanced considerablyby section 2 of the chief of the Sino-Japanese covenants signed on the 25th May, 1915,in consequence of a Japanese ultimatum. In this &quot; Eastern Inner Mongolia &quot; was included with South Manchuria as a region in which the Chinese Government acknow-ledged the special position enjoyed by Japan, and granted special rights to Japanesesubjects. And China bound herself to obtain Japan&apos;s consent before granting to thesubject of a third Power permission to build a railway, or before raising u, loan with a third Power for the building of a railway, in Eastern Inner Mongolia ; and to consultfirst with Japan in case political, financial, or military advisers or instructors areemployed in Eastern Inner Mongolia.[1998] B 2
Beyond the abortive effort by the Khorchin djassak mentioned above, InnerMongolia made no serious attempt to sever connection with China after the 1911 Revo-lution, and, so far as we know, China as the dominant Power was juridically competent to enter into these engagements.Recently Japan has tried to secure recognition by the Allies of a special position inthis region by holding out for its exclusion from the operations of the new consortium.The Chinese Expedition to Urga, 1919. The revolution and civil war in Russiaand Siberia have altered the whole situation. During 1918, from being a protectingfriend, Russia, through the spread of Bolshevism and disorder, became the principaldanger of the Outer Mongols. Soon after the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks,Semenof, the semi-Mongol Ataman of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks, was assisted by japan and later by the Allies to stem the Bolshevik progress eastward, and for sometime he had to make Bargut territory his base of operations. Early in 1919 he seemsto have contemplated the formation of a Mongol State to include the Buriats (RussianMongols), Khalkhas (Outer&quot; Mongols), and Barguts ; and there is scarcely a doubt thathe sent delegates to IJrga for this purpose. But while the Japanese steadily supportedhim in opposing Bolshevism, it was given out that they were by no means favourable tothe formation of a new Mongol State; and it is probable that these views of theJapanese Government had some influence on the policy of the pro-Japanese militaryclique ruling at Peking.There is no reason to question the general accuracy of the statement of recentfacts given in the communique to Reuter&apos;s correspondent. According to this a telegramof the 19th March, 1919, from Urga-from the Chinese Resident presumably to theChinese Government, reported that &quot; the leader of the Buriats had despatched repre-sentatives to Urga with magnificent presents for the Khutukhtu, that many of his menwere proceeding to Urga on a seditious mission, and that, in order to counteract these movements, the Mongolian Government earnestly appealed to China to concentratesufficient troops in Mongolia.&quot; Again, on the 18th May, a telegram said that &quot; in three or four months&apos; time the Buriat leader would send the bandit chieftain Fucheno with3,000 men to invade Mongolia from Tsetsen (i.e., the Tsetsen Khanate which extendsfrom near Urga eastward to Barga) in league with 4,000 Buriats from Udinsk.&quot; Onthe 18th June another telegram stated that the &quot;Buriat leader was attempting to recruit men for his army in Urga in order to intercept communication between Kiakhtaand Urga, to expel the Chinese from Outer Mongolia, and to declare the independence of Mongolia&quot; ; and the Outer Mongol Government strongly urged. the despatch of chinese troops to save the situation. &quot; On the 23rd June the Outer Mongol Govern-ment plaintively reiterated its helplessness and invoked the assistance of chinese troops to prevent the crisis which was being created by these disturbing elements, theBuriats and their bandit allies.&quot; And on the 29th June the Premier of the UrgaGovernment, Prince Cheilin, stated that &quot; unless Chinese troops arrived speedily theMongolian situation could not be saved.&quot; Corroboration of some of these statementshas come independently from His Majesty&apos;s consul at Harbin.Contemporaneously with these telegrams from Urga, which we may be sure were largely the work of the Chinese Resident, an active propaganda was started in theChinese militarist press to show that Outer Mongolia stood in peril of attacks fromSemenof and the Bolsheviks. Hsu Shu-cheng, the most capable and unscrupulous ofthe Northern generals, was appointed commander-in-chief of the defence forces on theMongol frontier, an expeditionary force was collected at Kalgan, and by September3,000 of them had reached Urga. General Hsu followed in November, and, accordingto report, he obtained the consent of the Urga Government, except the Khutukhtu, tothe cancellation of the Kiakhta Treaty by means of an ultimatum.But the story in the communique is that in the autumn of 1919 the ChineseGovernment began to receive a series of telegraphic despatches from the Residentreporting on the desire existing in Urga towards a complete return to the oldconditions. These were followed by a special Mongol mission to Peking to express thewishes of the Khutukhtu and the Mongol dignitaries &quot; to cancel the arrangements which marred the tranquillity of what is an integral part of the Republic.&quot; Finally, inNovember, a formal memorial addressed to the President of China praying for the abrogation of autonomy was received by the Resident in Urga from the assembledMinisters of the Outer Mongol Government; and on the strength of this a Presidentialmandate was issued on the 22nd November at Peking repudiating all the Russo-Chinese and Russo-Mongol agreements concluded since the declaration of Mongolindependence, complying with the Mongol request, and promising the Mongol race thesame liberal treatment which had been extended to it under the Manchus.
* Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, Mohammedans, and Tibetans, which at the founding of the ChineseRepublic were all embraced in one unified dominion.The communique^ which is explanatory of this mandate, concludes on a lofty note,and the final paragraph is worthy of quotation in full: &quot;The Government of China, in complying with this earnest appeal to restore the old order of affairs, is moved by the heartfelt desire to assist in the establish-ment of general peace on an ,enduring basis, and it is impossible to continue thearrangements which have obviously lapsed owing to the dissolution of the EussianEmpire, and which were a constant invitation to unrest. The policy now beingcarried out is in strict agreement with the frontier principles established by thelate dynasty, for China sixty years ago anticipated the ruling of the recent paris conference that the fundamental necessity exists to give all nations access to thesea, and her cession of the&apos; left bank of the Amur, together with the right of navigation on&apos; that great waterway with continued frontier trade privileges,conferred on the Eussian people all they could legitimately claim beyond LakeBaikal. To-day, as in the case of Persia, where the arrangement made by the lateEussian Government has likewise automatically terminated, and has been replaced by a new treaty freely entered into and more in consonance with existing circum-stances, the frank appeal of the Urga Government to the public of the five races*marks a new stage in world reorganisation. It is now not too much to hope thatin the not-distant future general peace and tranquillity will reign throughoutevery district of the Chinese domain, and will promote all those high objects ofcivilisation which to-day are so constantly in the thoughts and declarations ofstatesmen and peoples alike.&quot;The reference to Persia is specially striking.Russian Ministers protest. In the Presidents mandate of the 22nd november the Chinese Government declared itself ready to enter into negotiations with a futurerecognised Russian Government regarding the position of Eussian merchants in Mon-golia; but this declaration, according to Reuter, did not satisfy the Russian Ministerat Peking, who protested against China&apos;s arbitrary cancellation of the various Mongolagreements of 1912, 1913, and 1915. The Minister pointed out that treaties cannot be cancelled by one of the contracting parties except in a case of war, and that Russia, farfrom being at war, had been in alliance with China.Chinese Garrisons in Barga. The Russo-Chinese Agreement of 1915 dealing withBarga is one of those cancelled by the mandate. His Majesty&apos;s consul, at Harbinreported at the end of November, L919, that a North-Eastern Defence Force GeneralHsu&apos;s is called the North-Western Defence Force under General Wu, Commander ofthe 29th Division, had been established, and that it had been arranged to strengthen the Chinese garrisons along the Chinese Eastern railway by 6,000 men. Most ofthese were being assigned to Hailar and Manchuria stations, which are in Bargutterritory. The latest information is that these reinforcements have reached their,destinations overland from Taonanfu, and that a public announcement of the cancellation of the Barga Agreement is imminent;Urianghai and the Bolsheviks. The Urianghai country lying between the Syanskand Tannu-ola Mountains in extreme North-West Mongolia has for long been penetratedby Russian settlers, over whom Russian jurisdiction has been exercised in the past.The November memorial of the Urga Ministers stated that &quot; the forces of the so-calledWhite Army have forcibly occupied Urianghai, an old possession of Outer Mongolia,and have attacked both Mongol and Chinese troops; and this was followed by the entry of the Red Army, making the situation unendurable.&quot;Objects of the Expedition. There has been some speculation regarding the motiveswhich have swayed the Mongols and the Chinese in the recent occurrences. We mayconclude that, if left to themselves, the Khutukhtu and the Outer Mongol Governmentwould prefer to remain undisturbed in the position created for them by the Kiakhtatreaty. But they see little chance of this, and they have been seriously alarmed bythe schemes of Semenof, who was believed on reliable grounds to be meditating a sudden descent on Urga from Kiakhta under pretence of outflanking Bolshevik attacks,and only desisted, it is said, because he was advised by the Japanese that the moment was not propitious for such a move.   All along it has been generally asserted that the
Japanese were behind Semenof in his schemes, and the Chinese have not been slow topoint out that the alternative to absorption by Russia or Japan is a return to theChinese fold. Again, there is the fear of the Bolsheviks, who are comparatively nearat hand and who really seem to have made their presence felt in Urianghai. Allthings considered, it is not difficult to understand why the Outer Mongols should prefer the easy-going Chinese control, which gave them peace for two hundred years,to domination by Semenof or the Bolsheviks or Japan, any of which would berevolutionary in Mongol estimation.The Chinese are naturally anxious to rehabilitate themselves wherever is is possible,and the disruption of Russia has given them their opportunity in Mongolia. There is usually a party in Peking who are ready to embark in enterprises to recover supremacyin the old dependencies, and at the time there were also internal reasons whyGeneral Hsu Shu-cheng, who is a power amongst the Northern military leaders, shouldfavour an expedition to Mongolia. He wished to retain in his own hands a strongmilitary force for his own political ends, and the despatch of an expedition to Mongoliagave him an adequate pretext; but in the exhausted state of the Peking finances it isunderstood that the necessary money or arms could only have been supplied with the help of Japan..January 12, 1920.o
