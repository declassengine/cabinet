circulated^^ne Secretary of State for India,TrjUTTFlDENTIAI,With reference to the Peace Delegation Meinoraiiduin on Arab Unity(section (j of CP. 391), 1 circulate to my colleagues a memorandum by theIndian Section of the Peace Delegation.1. The Peace Delegation propose that the Treaty should make no formal recognition of Arab unity, mainly because of anticipated French oppositionto the enunciation or fulfilment of such a policy. They conclude with theremark that if the movement has any real substance or vitality it will realiseitself irrespective of any formal recognition of the principle in the Treaty.2. An alternative suggestion Las, it is understood, been put forward by major Young, recommending that the British area in the hinterland ofPalestine, down to the conjunction of FeisaTs Syria with the Hedjaz, shouldbe given to the French. In return we will secure the modifications required on the boundary of Palestine and Syria, and at the same time we shall tiethe French down to a recognition of an Arab nationalist policy.3. Tt is assumed that the canon of our policy is the early developmentof a free people capable of self-expression. It is believed that the main-tenance of the British Empire is an important factor in this development.4. To adopt the views of the Peace Delegation would be to abandonwhat has hitherto been a point of accepted policy, and to accept diplomaticdefeat inflicted by the French in respect of a principle admitted to be soundin itself. In spite of their concluding paragraph, the Peace Delegationrecognise that their recommended solution would be a heavy, if not a fatal,blow to the cause of Arab unity.5. Major YoungV alternative has many immediate attractions. It isheroic. It contemplates the surrender of &quot; red &quot; territory to such an extent as to make the Haifa Railway an impossibility, for the sake of an ideal. Itis true that in case of a war in which there was French or Arab hostility tous, the railway would be difficult, almost impossible, to defend, but this must have been already recognised by the War Office, who are anxious tosee it through.It would materially assist our present relations with Feisal: and itwould give the Zionists the frontier they desire.10  769     150 1.20 . S. M.
But it is doubtful il&apos;, ultimately, it would secure the desired object.Its immediate effect would be to accelerate the transference of thecentre of gravity in Arab politics to Damascus. This will secure to theFrench what they are already claiming the preponderance of influence inthe Middle East, a preponderance which will be swollen by their securing to themselves all the credit for this cession of territory by us ; and with Frenchviews and the French political outlook as it is, it is impossible to believebut that, preamble or no preamble, there will be the gravest danger ofabsorption and annexation of the whole, instead of a part, of FeisaFs kingdomThe consequences will be unfortunate for Mesopotamia. Damascus willbe given a start which is unfair in her forthcoming rivalry with Baghdadwhereas Baghdad commercially and politically could probably become the better capital.Further, an immediate effect would be to stimulate the activities of, andpossibly to give power to, the Sharif parly in Mesopotamia. This is to bedeprecated. The result would be the government of the tribesmen by an arab EfTendi bureaucracy, incapable and corrupt, and fatal to the earlydevelopment of free democracy.In Palestine the effect would be to ring round the Zionist State with french influence, a heavy price to pay for the rectified frontier : and one inwhich the disappearance of the advantages calculated to be conferred by the bagadad-Haifa Railway is to be reckoned.6. I would therefore recommend that we press for the retention of the preamble as a statement of policy ; that we pursue our liberal intentions inregard to Mesopotamia, and build up a government which shall express the will of the tribes and races. Baghdad will then attain the pre-eminence shedeserves, at some later date unite with the Southern Syria which will also be under our control, and eventually effect Arab Unity by compelling FrenchDamascus to fail into line.This solution leaves untouched the rectification of the boundary ofPalestine, regarding which reference to arbitration is not impossible.
