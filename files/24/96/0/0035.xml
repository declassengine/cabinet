His Britannic Mafest^s CoyeVnment)THS jAIIiWAY LABOUR POglglglorandum for the Cabinet by the fleoretary Of the.If 5nfi;cry oflgf is&apos;orOotober 1914 it was agreed with the H.U.E. and^^JsTiTE.!&apos;. that the conditions of service then in.force shouldcontinue throughout the War, and that no alteration in theseconditions should be considered.     his arrangement was ^aiheredto until the end of 1918 (exoept that in August 1917 theA.S.L.E*F, demanded an eight hour day, and other concessions,when the then president of the Board of Trade promised that within one month of the cessation of hostilities a scheme fora shorter working day would receive the sympathetic considerationof the Government).Although the conditions of service remainedunaltered during the War various increases in wages weregiven to meet the increased cost of living, and at the endof 1918, these amounted in the case of men coming within theConciliation Grades, to 22/- per week.immediately after the Armistice the and theA.S.L.E.]?. put forward their respective programmes forconditions of service, and on the 6th Dec ember, 1916, ^agrsementswere signed with each Union providing that the principleof an eight hour day was to come into force on the 1st February,1919, and that all existing conditions of servioe should remain unaltered pending the decision of a Committee.   Overtime was toapply after the eight hour day, or 48 hour week, as&apos; the casemight be.The Government suggested that the negotiations as to conditions of servioe should be postponed until the Ministry ofTransport was formed, but eventually it was decided that theyshould commence earlier.   The first Meeting was held on the12th February, when, the two Unions again submitted their programmes,lt /whioh(
whioh did not agree in all reapeots.    Several meetings were held,but in March the men complained of delay, and after discussion withthe Cabinet it was agreed that the existing wages should be stabilised until the end of the year, and that negotiations shouldcontinue with a view to standardising rates of pay and conditionsof service on all lines.    Meetings continued to be held betweenthe E.E.Co and the Unions, and agreement was reached with regardto almost all conditions of service.   Under this agreement themen benefited considerably; they got a guaranteed week; a guaranteed day; time worked over 8 hours being paid for at therate of time and a quarter; payment at time and a quarter fornight duty, and at time and a half for Sunday duty and a week&apos;sholiday each year with pay.    The consideration of standardrates of pay was taken up although the difficulties of fixingpermanent rates in abnormal times are obvious.    Thewere dissatisfied with the   rates of pay proposed to Engine man,and on the 5th August a Deputation from the Society saw thePresident of the Board of Trade and disoussed the position.   Therates of pay for Engine men were further disoussed at a meeting atwhich both Unions were represented, and agreement was oome to at ameeting on 20th August, as a result of whioh new standard scales of pay whioh (exoept for cleaners) were somewhat higher than anyof the existing scales together with the war wage, were to beintroduced.The Government proposals in regard to wages of othergrades within the Conciliation Scheme were not at this timeready for submission to the H,U.R.t and on the 16th September,Mr. Thomas asked that they should be submitted as soon aspossible.   The proposals were submitted within a few days anddeolared by the M.U.R., to be unsatisfactory, and a Strike wasthreatened failing receipt of more favourable proposals by noon on the 25th September./UP
Up to this time the Jtord of urade had boon responsiblefor the Government side of the negotiations, but on the 23rdSeptember, this responsibility passed to the Ministry 6f Transport.Sir Eric Geddes&apos; interviewed the Representatives of the N.U.R. whosubsequently saw the Prime Minister.   They complained that theproposals submitted for the other grades did not carry into effect the principle which had been applied in the case of the Jln^irie jnen,that is to say, that the rates were not equivalent to the^existingstajjMrlTwage, plus war wage.   It was pointed out to them that ithad been clearly understood that in the standardisation of wages itwould be necessary to grant larger increases to the higher paidgrades in order to remedy the anomalies produced by the flat ratewar wage, and that the proposed minimum of 40/- per week was more thandouble the pre-war minimum, which was 18/- per week or less. In addi-tion to this a portion of the war wage would continue until the costof living fell,, so that as long as prices remained at the present level no man would receive less in total earnings that he receivesnow.The N.U.R. declared that the Government offers, which included a suggestion that present earnings should he stabilised at least until March 1920, and that no reduction in the war wage which re-remained as such would be made until the cost of living had fallen to and remained below a certain percentage, for a period of threemonths, were unacceptable and declined to continue negotiations, andthe Strike accordingly commenced at mid-night on the 26th September.A settlement of the strike was come to on October 5th and theterms of the settlement provided, inter alia, that on the fullresumption of work negotiations shaiAld&apos;be continued with the under-standing that they would be completed before the 31st December,1919.After the resumption of work by the railway^men arrangements were made, in accordance with the above provision, for a renewal of the negotiations which had been broken off, and a number of meetings were held at which the Pr^me Minister ,p**es44&amp;&amp;j or theMinister of &quot;Trans oort presided.-3- &apos;
It was agreed at a meeting on October/terd that new schedulesof standard rates should be prepared for the grades for whichschedules had already been forwarded to the representatives of themen, and that schedule should also be prepared for those gradesfor which they had not yet been got out, i.e. signalmen, signal and telegraph staff and carriage and wagon examiners.   These scheduleswere prepared and whilst retaining a minimum of 40/- a week as thestandard rates of some grades, in rural districts, improvements weremade in the rates hitherto offered, rising to a maximum of 65/- aweek in the case of passenger and goods guards after 9 years service.This compares with a maximum previously offered of 60/- after 11 years.The Schedule for the signalmen divided them into 7 classes,according to the nature of the work at the particular cabin, and thestandard Vates proposed ranged from a minimum Of 46/- to a maximum of 75/- per week.At a meeting on November 13th Mr. Thomas pointed out that it wasimpossible for the Prime Minister to go into the details of thoseschedules, nor were they suitable for discussion at a large meeting,and his suggestion was that departmental sub-committees should be setup consisting c*f representatives of the management and of the men inthe particular grades and these sub*-eommittees should discuss thedetails.The suggestion was accepted and it was decided that four sub-committees should be appointed to deal with the proposed rates of pay of goods workers, permanent way men, locomotive men (not coveredby the previous settlement), and the traffic staff.   It was understoodthat these Committees should deal with any hardships or anomalies thatmight be shown to exist ::in any of the grades, but the Prime Sinistermade it a condition on which the Government assented to the appointmentof the sub-committees that the limits of the scheme I.e. the 40/-minimum and the 65/- maximum (except in t ie case of signalmen), mustbe regarded as a second reading principle, and the&apos;Committees enuldnot widen these limits.
The Sub-CoFJitf.committees fot to work and practically settledall details of classification of the different grades, tut made no progress whatever as regards standard rates cf wage, and inDecember, the Government decided to approach, the question of standard rates from a new standpoint.The basis adopted was to ascertain the average weeklypre-war rate of a grade or group of grades, and add thereto :.35/-, this 35/- including the existing war wage of 33/-, wiuh an addition of 2/-, partly due to an increase in cost of living... andpartly to make up for the omission of fractions of a shilling inascertaining the average pre-war rate.    The amount thus aseer-tained was made subject to a sliding scale, giving a rise orfell of l/- for each full 5 points increase or reduction in thecost of living - taken at the time to be 125$ above the pre-warcost.This offer was made to the representatives of the union on December 4th, and Mr. Thomas declared that now he thoughtmatters were proceeding on the right lines, but he was dissatisfied with the figure of 25/-, and asked that this should be increasedto 38/-.   This meant an increase of 5/- in the existing war wage,which corresponds with the increase given by a Court of ArbitrationIto the men in the Engineering Trades on November 5th, and which applied to the Railway Shops.At a meeting on December 13th, Sir Eric Geddes, whilstinforming the representatives of the Union that he thought that astrong oase could be made out for no increase beyond 37/-, said he did not wish to haggle over the additional 1/-, and would therefore give the 38/- for which Mr. Thomas had asked.   It wasalso agreed, with regard to the sliding scale, that although anincrease should be given if the cost of living went up, thereshould be no decrease until after September 3oth, 1920.   It wasalso a part of the offer that however much the cost of living/fell,
fell, the wages of any grade should :iot fall below the ratesfor the grades contained in offers dated -November 5th and whichwere based, generally speaking, on an increase of at least 100$on the average pre-war rates of the respective grades.The menBs representatives agreed to recommend the delegates to accept the Government1s offer, which has been declared by Mr. Thomas to be a feir and honourable one, but inspite of this, the delegates have, by a large majority, rejectedit.(The points to whioh they object are principally:-(a) That the average rate of a grade has beentaken as a basis of calculation, and notthe highest rate paid by any Company inany grade, which was the original demand of the Union, and the principal question at issue in the Strike in September last.(b) The sliding scale.    The men olaim that therates now fixed should be permanent rates,however great a reduction there may be inthe oost of living.(c) That any increments accruing under thepresent wages negotiations shall operate as from August 18th,1919*(d) $hat a large number of their members are excluded from the present proposals, andthey demand that negotiations should be opened for these grades at once.As regards (c), the Government undertook, before theStrike, and during the settlement of the Strike, that any oon-oessions should date back to August 18th, when the settlement for the Locomotive Grades came into operation, but with theoffer made to the men in a letter dated  2nd December, thesuggestion was made that in place of payment back to August18th, a lump sum payment of 20/-   should be substituted foreach man coming within the proposals who was at work during themonth of December.   This was actually a suggestion made byMr. Thomas and he claimed in his speech at Birmingham that itwas more advantageous to the men than payment back to august 18th./The
The additional 5/-* included in the Governments proposal couldnot fairly be given for more than the month of December, as theEngineering Trades only received an additional 5/- from the beginningof that month.The grades referred to in (d) as not being included In theGovernments proposals include the men employed in the Shops. Theyhave been considered as coming within the awards given at differenttimes in the Engineering Trades, and at present receive the additional&apos;war wage of 33/6 per week, plus 12^ on all-earnings.   It is impracticable-cable to treat the men in the Railway Shops differently from men inthe gene al Engineering Trade, but although early in the negotiationsof last Spring,the Union fought hard for the inclusion of the Shopmen,It was made clear to t em that this could not be conceded!.It will be seen that the present demands of the men are practic-ally the entire claim put forward by them last Spring, with theadditional 5/- granted to the Engineering Trades and since extendedto other Trades.Sir William Plender estimated last April that the cost of themen&apos;s demands for the whole of the Railway Service would amount to anincrease of  104,000,000 on the pre-war wages bill of  47,000,000.To this must be added the cost of the additional 5/-, which would makethe total increased cost about  114,000,000 being an Increase of 243$9Sir William Plender also, in October last, edtimated thet        k-A ****additional cost involved in the Government s offer^ot that time tobe  61,600,000 - an increase of 151$ on the pre-war wage bill of 47,000,000.     To this must be added the increased cost due tothe additional 5/-, and certain concessions contained in the rates&apos;offered in November, which would bring the total additional costup to about  73,000,000, being an increase of 155$.The representatives of the men have asked for a meeting withthe Minister of Transport upon the rejection of the Government offer and he proposes to meet them on Tuesday afternoon, the 13th instant.He desires that the position arising out of the rejection ofthe Government offer and the present demands of the men shall receiveprior consideration by the Cabinet.Uth January,19&amp;0- R.
