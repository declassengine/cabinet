I do not see any escape from the conclusionthat the use of animals in these necessary experiments is unavoidable.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.5th January, 1920.MEMORANDUM BY THE MASTER-GENERAL OF THE ORDNANCE.In consequence of the Cabinet decision &quot; to continue our gas organization,&quot;estimates are being prepared for the continuance of chemical warfare research, which isby far the most important section of a gas organization during peace time. This raisesimmediately the question of the use of animals for experiments with toxic gases, asthe value and scope of chemical warfare research depends on the extent to whichanimals can be employed for this purpose. All such experiments on animals have beendiscontinued since May, 1919, as a result of representations made by the Home Officeto the War Office.*During the war the relative toxicity of different gases and the nature of the lesionsproduced by them were determined by exposing animals to gas in small experimentalchambers. The results of such experiments are of fundamental importance, notonly for the improvement of offensive and defensive appliances^ but also for the study ofthe pathology of gas poisoning and the development of therapeutic measures.Permission to expose animals to gas on condition of their being destroyed immediatelyafter they had been gassed, would not give the required information, as it is necessary,both for offensive and for therapeutic purposes, to keep animals under observation for acertain time after the exposure to gas, a type of experiment to which the Home office has made special objection.In addition to the so-called &quot; chamber experiments,&quot; animals were used during thewar in &quot; field experiments,&quot; in which they were exposed to gas liberated in the open by service methods (e.g., gas shell fired from a gun) in order to see whether the effectsobtained in the laboratory could be reproduced in the field, to ascertain the quantity of gas needed to attain a certain tactical result, and to study the influence of weather conditions. Experience has shown that without field trials the results of laboratoryresearch may be most misleading. For instance, the Germans used very large quantitiesof an arsenic compound which gave most promising results in the laboratory, but whenfired in artillery shell failed almost entirely to inflict casualties on us. Most field trials,if they are to be conclusive, involve the use of animals. The examination of a gascloud by chemical methods alone gives results of very doubtful value, and may yield no evidence as to the exact state in which a gas is present in the air and therefore as to itstoxicity.All these points were considered by the recent War Office Committee on chemical warfare Organization, which contained representatives of the Army, Navy and AirForce, and a number of scientists who had taken a leading part in chemical warfareresearch during the war. In their report the Committee emphasized &quot; the absolutenecessity of carrying out experiments on animals, as, otherwise, essential informationcan only be obtained by substituting men for animals. Unless freedom is given toscientists in this matter, the Committee is of opinion that our Research Department willbe very heavily handicapped in working against the scientists of rival nations, whererestrictions of this sort do not exist, and the safety of the Empire will be seriouslyimperilled.&quot;Further it is impossible to divorce the study of defence against gas from the study(B20/49) .80  1/20  H&amp;S  7849wo
of the use of gas as an offensive weapon, as the efficiency of the defence depends entirely on an accurate knowledge as to what progress is being or is likely to be made in the offensive use of this weapon.The Committee emphasized the necessity for making comprehensive provision for research in the following paragraph : &quot; When the study of chemical warfare in the fighting forces is being initiatedthe Committee wishes to emphasize the fact that if this study is to serve any useful purpose it must be recognized that the application of this weapon to war isas yet in its infancy and that in order to ensure that we do not fall behind any possible rivals, every arrangement must be made for the continuous investigation of this subject in the most thorough manner possible.&quot;The popular feeling against the use of animals in experiments is partly due to theknowledge that dogs have been employed for this purpose. It should be understoodthat in the opinion of experts the use of dogs from a scientific point of view is unnecessary and on general grounds is to be avoided. They were eventually used byus during the war solely because our results in which other animals had been used werein conflict with those of the French, who had relied entirely on dogs. It, therefore,became necessary to reconcile the two sets of observations. * In future such animals asmice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats, goats, &amp;c, would suffice; in short, a range ofdifferent types of animals is necessary.The question of the use of animals in the field and chamber experiments affects the programme of chemical warfare research so vitally that it is most desirable that adecision should be obtained on this point before next years estimates are submitted, as,other-wise, it is impossible to forecast the scale on which research should be carried out,and considerable expenditure might be incurred which would prove subsequently tohave been wasted. In this connection it must not be forgotten that other nations haverealized the need for research in gas warfare and are continuing their investigations onthis subject. The Americans have spent 7,000,000/. (85^- million dollars) on erectingand equipping Edgewood Arsenal, a comprehensive research and manufacturingexperimental station which is still in commission, and in France to-day a number ofconscripts with scientific training are being employed in various laboratories on researchconnected with chemical warfare problems as part of their military training.* The French by the use of dogs in their experiments found that hydrocyanic acid was highly toxicand produced most dramatic results. It was only when dogs and goats were exposed in pairs, when thedogs succumbed and the goats were unhurt, that the extreme susceptibilitj of dogs to this particular poisonwas discovered.
