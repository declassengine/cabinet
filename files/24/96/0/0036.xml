.13 DCOUMTCira IS THD PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTY1 S G0VERIIMBU5?).1&apos; OABIIMtProposal for the formation of jfcn Endowment for the enoouragement.      Live s&apos;tooic BreeltiTiffT     -435.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.During the autumn of 1919 the Ministry of Food haveaccumulated a surplus of between 2 and &apos;6 millions on the sale ofhome grown meat, having purchased from the farmers at a lowerrange of prices than corresponded to the price at which the meatwas sold to the public.   It was the intention of the Ministry ofFood to use this surplus in order to maintain a uniform, price pfmeat to the public throughout the period February-July 6th duringwhich the farmers wore to be paid higlier prices for their cattle-Not only would the whole of the accumulated profit have been required for the purpose of paying the highest prices promised to farmers, but a further draft would have been required from theTreasury, amounting to at least a million.:     If it is decided todecontrol meat on February 1st, the Ministry of Food will remain with this surplus in their hands and will/not require any subsidyfrom the Treasury.   Though the farmers who,, on the strength of theGovernment guarantee, have been making preparation to produce meatduring 19.20 at the higher rates would no longer be entitled to the promised prices, it would be administratively impossible to dis-tribute as compensation the surplus profit which the Ministry ofFood have made out of the sales of cattle bought from the farming community during the period of controlled lower prices.As the farming community are in justice entitled to this surplus I have to propose that it should be set aside for theirbenefit in the form of a fund to be devoted to tho improvement ofthe live stock industry in its widest sense.   This would deprivethem of the sense of grievance which they would legitimately feelif the money were withheld by the Government and devotepL to other,and non-agricultural, uses.1 need not enlarge upon the importance of the livestock business to the country.   According to the Census of
*Production for 1908 the value of the output of neat and neatproducts in the United Kingdom amounted annually to  86,500,000,riilk and dairy products were also produced to the value of 40,000,000 while the output of poultry and eggs was estimateda   10,000,000, all at pre-war values,The moneys voted for the improvement of livestock by the provision of better sires and the organisation of milkrecording amounted to approximately  24,600 in 1919-20 in Englandand Wales,  11,650 in Scotland.      21,600 was spent in ireland for the same purpose.     Research in these and cognate subjectsincluding also Veterinary Research was subsidised to the extent ofapproximately  12,500.The sums mentioned are much below the amounts expendedin our Dominions and other countries in which the live stockbusiness is of far less magnitude.In thus asking for the indirect return to the live stockproducers of the country of the money that has been derived from them have in mind the fact that I have been, most reluctantly, compelled,in response to the financial stringency, to abandon the extensive pro^gramme of live stock improvement which it v/as my intention to promoteas one of the main features of agricultural reconstruction policy.The live Stock Improvement Schemes which had been started in 1914have, already proved their value and have become the subject of intenseinterestamong farmers, especially among the smaller men and thesmall holders proper, who are not in a position to purchase for themselves bulls and boars of the most profitable class.     Thedemand upon the Ministry for the organisation of further societiesfor the purpose is far greater than can be met with the fundsat my disposal and will greatly increase as the new classof small holders is placed upon the land by the State.     Similarly,the demands upon the Ministry for the organisation of milk recording
societies, by far the most potent agency for the enlargement 6ihdcheapening of the milk supply, are overwhelming, and aconsiderable  campaign of enlightenment and advice is called forin order to secure the improvement in the cleanliness of milkwhioh the Ministry of Health are taking powers to enforce.   Thescheme whioh had been drawn up in my Ministry for the develop-raent of live stock and milk recording sohemes would entail theexpenditure of about  75,000 per annum.I should propose to devote the greater part of the appropriation for which I now aak to the creation of an endowmentfund of  1,500.000 for this scheme, the inoome from which wouldenable the Ministry to carry out its work without the sums atpresent asked for in the Vote.The rest would be applied to Live Stock research.   Theoountry possesses at present at Cambridge an Institute for the study of Animal Nutrition.   The work of this Institute is admittedly incomplete and I have before me a scheme for its development in order that it may deal with breeding and thephysiology of reproduction as well as nutrition, with in fact the whole field of the economio investigation of the production of animals and animal products including poultryo   Such experimentsare inevitably costly.. Allowing for the probable donations that could be obtained from the public when it can be made known thatthe State j  preparing for such a development, I estimate thatan additional income of  12,000 per annum will be required andthat the State must provide capital up to  60,000 involving inall an appropriation for endowment and capital of  300,000.Research into the diseases of animals is equallyundeveloped in the United Kingdom,   At present the only centresare the Ministry&apos; a laboratory at Addles tone and the RoyalVeterinary College.   Having in view the great annual losses that
that result from our comparative helplessness at present in dealingwith such diseases as swine fever, foot and mouth disease and con-tagious abortion, and the fact that human medicine is &quot;becoming moreand more   interrelated with certain problems of parasitic disease inanimals; also that the United Kingdom is the great source of supplyof the veterinary officers required in the public services of theEmpire, which officers have at present   no centre to obtain thenecessary post graduate training in research or the opportunity ofposting themselves in recent practice when on leave, I am of opinionthat there is urgent need for an Institute for Research into AnimalPathology, of the first grade, which should be associated with one ofthe great     medical schools.   Onothese very strong grounds I should therefore assign a portion of the fund to the endowment of an Insti-tute for fundamental research in Animal Pathology.   I estimate that such an Institute will require an annual income of  7,000, and capital expenditure to the extent of  60,000 for the erection and   &apos;equipment of laboratories.     ..The total appropriation for which I ask is thus  2,000,000 to be distributed as follows:-Endowment of live stock improvement schemes.   1,500,000&quot;        &quot;   research in animal husbandry 240,000&quot;        l!        &quot;        in animal pathology      ^^MQi.&amp;9il1,360,000Capital expenditure on 2 research institutes    . 120,OOP, 2,000,000This is considerably less than the surplus fundaccumulated by the Ministry of Pood and which would &quot;fee available if decontrol is sanctioned.The Beard of Agriculture for Scotland and the Departmentof Agriculture for Ireland would be entitled to their share cfthis money, but the two research institutes would,  I hope, beregarded as serving the whole United Kingdom.
In putting before the Cabinet this application forthe assignment of the sum accumulated by the Ministry of Food,I claim that the money, as a profit made upon pure&amp;ases from the farmers of the United Kingdom and not returned to then in furtherpurchases at the higher prices which were promised, is justly ow:n?to agriculture.    Further its application to the purposes I have indicated is an important measure of reconstruction which wouldrapidly prove remunerative not only to agriculturists,, but tothe oountry at large.1 of F.12. 1. 20.
