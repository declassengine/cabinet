This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.THE CABINET.MILITARY ASPECT OF THE TURKISH peace settlement.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the following Memorandum  prepared by  the General Staff in amplification of paragraphs 4 and 5 in CP. 342 of 24th December.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.6th January, 1920.1. Owing to  the  impotence  and  unrepresentative character of the Turkish W&quot;.Q. 0152Government it is obvious that the mere acceptance by it of peace terms will carry littleweight in itself, except in the unlikely contingency that the terms will be acceptable tothe Nationalist Party.2. This means that there must be very close consideration of the relation betweenthe actual decisions which it may be desired to enforce, and the means of securing their effective execution. Realization of the geographical features of the problem from thepoint of view of time and space is thus involved.3. It will then be apparent that a declaration of intention, except with referenceto areas immediately accessible such as Thrace, Constantinople, Smyrna or Batoum,may have the worst possible result if made before such time as some method is readyto give effect to it.4. Therefore, though main decisions may, and doubtless will, be arrived at quickly,the sensation caused by a general and premature announcement is to be avoided. for it is clear that before any announcement is made the decisions should be conveyed tothose principally responsible for their enforcement.   These will be : i (a.) British and Allied Military Commanders, including French, Greeks  and italians.(&amp;.) Embryo States such as the Arab, Armenian, Azerbaijan, Georgian, and possibly the Kurdish, who will all have their own political and defensive arrange-ments to make.(c.) Also time must be given for the Government of India and the Administrationsof Mesopotamia and Egypt to take such steps as may be necessary to counter the repercussion which is to be expected in those countries in case ofdisapproval of the Turkish peace terms.5. In fact, the Turks should be told last of all, and for them the word and the deedshould be simultaneous. The most satisfactory principle will be for the military commanders concerned to be left to time whatever announcement may be necessary attheir own discretion in accordance with military arrangements regarding their own forces and those of the Allies or small States concerned.6. To turn to the actual application of the above. The following are examples of potential decisions the effect of which must be considered : (a.) Cession of Eastern Thrace, including Adrianople, to Greece.  -(b.) Internationalization of Constantinople,(c.) Withdrawal of Greeks from Aidin Vilayet.(d.) Withdrawal of Italians from Southern Anatolia. y(e.) Creation of Armenian State.(/.) Penetration by French into the &quot; Blue &quot; zone in Cilicia and the ArmenianYilayets.(g.) Establishment of independence of Georgia and Azerbaijan.7. Taking the first of these, (a.) The French have a division in reserve which,together with the five divisions of Greek troops available on that front, shouldbe sufficient to establish Greek administration as required. It should therefore besufficient if General Franchet d&apos;Esperey is informed beforehand of the area which the greeks are to take over, so that he can make his military arrangements before theannouncement is made.(B20/54)   100 &quot;1/20  H&amp;s  7854wo
(6.) As regards Constantinople and the Straits the same precaution will benecessary for General Milne to make his preparations and for the War Office toconsider the necessity or otherwise for the provision of reinforcements,(c.) and (d.) As regards Smyrna and Adalia. If it is decided that the Greeks and italians, either or both, are to withdraw, it will lie a grave mistake to make any premature announcement. This question is necessarily interwoven with that ofArmenia, for if pressure is suddenly taken off the Turks in the Aidin or Konia Vilayetsthey will be free to turn on the Armenians. Neither Italians nor Greeks will probablyrelish having to remain in the Smyrna area when once it has been decided that theyare not to annex the country. But they have brought this on themselves by going, orconsenting to go, to Anatolia, and they should be given a fixed date, which should becommunicated to the Armenian Government, before which they must not withdraw.As regards (e.) If His Majestys Government subscribe to a Peace Conferencepolicy of creating an Armenian State, time must be allowed for the necessary practical measures to be taken.The relation between this and the Smyrna situation has been touched on in theprevious paragraph. As things stand it may be accepted that the Armenians can look after themselves during the present winter, i.e. : They can hold their own for the time being against Azerbaijan. Their refugeesare provided for by American relief measures, and their situation vis-a-vis Georgiais sufficiently satisfactory.Also Mustapha Kemal who, together with Raouf, is believed to have about 25,000men between Trezibond and Bayazid, will not be able to take any aggressive actionduring the winter.On the reopening of the Peace Conference the time available for making thenecessary preparations will, however, be very short. During this time the Greeksmust remain in Smyrna, if not the Italians in Southern Anatolia, and the necessary equipment should now be sent to Armenia for an army of 40,000 men under mandatoryofficers.The Armenians can find the men themselves, but they must have equipment.Whether this should be provided by France, England or America, or possibly Italy, orany combination of these Powers, must be one of the first questions to be settled at theforthcoming Conference. &quot;Here it may be said that previous objections to arming the Armenians appearuntenable if Armenia is to be formed into an independent State, and, incidentally, thisquestion is affected by the Bolshevik menace in Trans-Caspia, which makes the armingof the Armenians more desirable than heretofore.(/) It must be made quite clear to the French that certain Turkish organizedunits and sympathizers still remain in the &quot;Blue&quot; zone, and that it will be for theFrench Government to deal with these in case of opposition.((/.) Should it be decided to establish the independence of Georgia and Azerbaijan,the British Representative with General Denikin should be given timely warning toprepare the field and to make it clear to Denikin that he will lose Allied official supportif he resists the policy of the Peace Conference in this respect.It is for consideration whether the independence of these two States should be declared simultaneously with that of Armenia or whether this point is immaterial. Butat first sight it seems probable that if all three countries were given their independenceat the same time they would have less incentive to jealousy of each other and mutualaggression.8. The above can only be a rough sketch to illustrate the considerations involved.These will doubtless be developed during the process of negotiations, but it is hopedthat this explanation may provide warning against what is most to be feared,namely, a premature public announcement of the decisions regarding Turkey. If the argument is accepted as correct and reasonable, it would appear to be the best policy toto take the Press, as far as possible, into the confidence of the Peace Conference, but toput them on their honour not to divulge the findings. There is, no doubt, that theinformation would, nevertheless, reach the Turks by various channels, and this isprobably inevitable ; but information acquired by&apos;unauthorized disclosures has not thesame effect as an official announcement, and could not be turned to the same account by Islamic and other agitators.General Staff,War Office.
