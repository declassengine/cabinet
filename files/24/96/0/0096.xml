[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s, Government.]3 31)CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,- Foreign Office.(11501.)Germany/042.MEMORANDUMonTHE BERLIN DISORDERS OF JANUARY 13, 1920.THE immediate occasion of the demonstrations of strikers under the auspices ofthe Communists and the Independent Socialists which led to the shooting down ofthe mob by the military police (&quot; Sicherheitspolizei&quot;) in front of the Reichstag on tuesday, 13th January, was the debate on the second reading of the Factory CouncilsBill. This Bill had been under the consideration of a committee of the Reichstag duringthe Christmas recess with a view to reconciling the demands of the working classes withthe vital interests of the employers. In the committee a compromise had been effectedaccording to which (1) two representatives of the Workers&apos; Council were to sit on theBoard of Directors of each firm; (2) the balance-sheet was to be shown to these repre-sentatives when there were over 500 employees; (3) the Workers&apos; Council was to havethe right of intervention in cases of dismissal but not in cases of engagement of employees.This compromise is anathema to the Communists and to considerable sections ofthe working classes belonging to the Independent Socialist and even to the MajoritySocialist Party, being regarded as a fatal concession to the capitalist system and asfailing to, carry out. Article 165 of the Constitution.   Article 165 enacts that . Workmen and employees are entitled to co-operate on equal terms, togetherwith their employers, in settling the conditions of wages and work and also in thewhole economic development of the productive forces [of the country]. Theworkers and employees will receive for the purpose of maintaining their social and economic interests statutory representation in Factory Workmen&apos;s Councils aswell as in regional councils organised according to economic districts and in aWorkmens Council of the Empire.This Workmen&apos;s Council of the Empire, according \o the same Article of theConstitution, is to combine with representatives of the employers and of other sectionsof the community to form an Economic Council of the Empire which is to have theright of submitting economic measures to the Reichstag and of advising on such measures when proposed by the Government. The whole Article represents anattempt to &quot; anchor&quot; the Workmen&apos;s Councils in the Constitution, but it falls very far short of what the Communists and those Independent Socialists who are under their influence desire. At the Congress of the Independent Socialist Party at Leipzig lastmonth resoiutions were adopted which committed the party to pure Sovietism and the&quot;dictatorship of the proletariat,&quot; i.e., of a working-class minority of the nation.The political development of Germany under the new regime was decisivelydirected into quite other channels as far back as December 1918 a month after theRevolution when the representatives of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils of thewhole Empire met in Berlin and passed a kind of self-denying ordinance in favour ofthe election of a National Constituent Assembly and the exercise by that Assemblyof supreme political power. With this vital decision against Sovietism the Communistshave never reconciled themselves, and they have gradually succeeded in winning overto their side the majority of the Independent Socialist leaders, including some of thosewho at the Congress&apos;of December 1918 had declared against Sovietism.The excitement of the Independent Socialist Party in the Reichstag is due to theirindignation at seeing the majority of the National Assembly promoting legislationcalculated to lead Germany farther and farther away from Sovietism. At the decisivenational Congress of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils in December 1918, the communists tried to interrupt the proceedings and to influence the members bydemonstrative incursions of bands of soldiers and workmen into thw Congress Hall.They also organised- strikes and processions of workmen in the streets, and theyresorted to armed insurrection and street-fighting on a great scale until these were
finally put down by the energy of the Socialist Minister of Defence, Noske, andhis skilful organisation and management of the new military forces of the Republic.The demonstrations of the 13th January in the great square in front of the Reichstagand the attack upon the armed police guarding the building represent a freshresort by a minority to measures of intimidation. Evidence was given at the subsequent proceedings of the House by members by the Prussian (Socialist) Ministerof the Interior, Heine, among others that they had seen with their own eyesIndependent Socialist Deputies, particularly the woman Deputy, Frau Clara Zietz,gesticulating from the windows of the Reichstag and inciting the mob.The immediate result of the riot, in which some fifty people lost their lives, will beto strengthen the majority which supports law and order. A state of siege has beenproclaimed throughout Germany, with the exception of Saxony, Bavaria, Wurttemberg,and Baden. At present the Government has adequate forces regulars, reserves, and armed police to maintain order against the Communist minority. But the situationseems to furnish a fresh warning that, if the terms of the Peace Treaty are enforced andGermany&apos;s armed forces of every description reduced to 100,000 men, the prospects oianarchy will become very menacing. Any weakness on the part of the government must tend to increase the following of the Communists, who have already been gainingsome ground in consequence of the general distress and discontent and who areencouraged by the recent military successes of the Moscow dictatorship.It ought to be noted incidentally that among the Communists the beginning of a movement of aggressive hostility on Bolshevik lines towards the Entente has beennoted, particularly in Hamburg.January 1.9, 1920.e
