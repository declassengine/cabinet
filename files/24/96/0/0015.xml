I circulate for consideration &quot;by the Home AffairsCommittee a draft Bill to make a small amendment of theMerchant Shipping Act, 1894.This Bill removes an anomaly due to the fact that aprovision in an old private Act of 1822 regarding the remuneration of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity house was not repealed when the financial control&apos;of the GeneralLighthouse Authorities passed - in 1853 - to the &quot;Board ofTrade.     That provision does not apply to the two other general Lighthouse Authorities, which have much smallerresponsibilities and are differently constituted and unpaid.The effect of the provision in the 1822 Act has beenthat the remuneration of an &quot;activett Elder Brother has been 500, and that of the Deputy Master  1,000 per annum; amounts which were adequate at the time, but which having regard tothe vast increase in the work and responsibilities of theTrinity House and the higher cost of living are no longersufficient to attract the best men from the Hercantile and royal Naval Services,     The Board of Trade propose, if the Billpasses, to increase these amounts to  700 and  1,400respectively.     The total amount ( 2,200) is too insignificantan addition to the cost of the Lighthouse Service (about 700,000 per annum) to involve an addition to the light dues.As the expenses of the General Lighthouse Authoritiesare defrayed out of these dues, the proposal will not affectany parliamentary Vote.The Bill is not expected to be controversial.The shipowners (the only interest likely to raise objection)have been consulted privately and say they do not proposeto raise the general,questions of light dues and lighthouseadministration on this Bill.(ogd)   A.
