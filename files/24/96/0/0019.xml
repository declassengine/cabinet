CONFIDENTIALk: enquiry w*s received recently from the PrimeMini star cf Canada asking the oiact data on which ratifica-taons of the Tsaaty with Germanyjwould &quot;be deposited by three off the Allied Powsrs, and also wbatbw a Proclamation ofPv?acs woild ba issued at that dato, or if not at what latrrdate*It &apos;i&quot;s*understood that th* deposit of ratificationsr*f *.rr^d to at th* end of the Treaty is axpected within thenext few days, and the Canadian Government has been informed accordingly.   I am however in some doubt as to the answer tobe sent to the second part of the above enquiry,It will be remembered that a Proclamation was issuedby His Majesty the King on the 1st of July enjoining ohser-vance of the Treaty &quot;upon the exchen-,e of the ratifications.this Proclamation was telegraphed to On^d-i at the time, andwas no doubt published there.It is presumed that, in view of the Proclamation ofof Peacethe 1st of July, there will be no further formal Proclamation /with Germany hore.    The question, however, arises whether anOrder in Council will be issued undrr the &quot;Termination of thePresent War (Definition) Act 1918,&quot; section 1(3), declaring acertain date as that of the termination of th? war with germany as the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill hasnot yet been passed it is possible, of course. that there may be difficulty in passing an Order in Council with regard toG-u-raany in the form contemplated by the Act of 192/35 and Iunderstand the view of the Parliamentary Counsel to be thatno Order in Council under the Act should be issued at present.I should, however, he glad to know definitely what procedure is contemplated so that the Canadian Government may be informed.I would also ask that the CJol cnial. Off ice may receive as longnotice as possible, of the proposed date of the issue of anyOrders
Orders in Council under the 19.18 Act, as it is of impor-tance that the self-governing Dominions should he informed in advance of the action which His Majesty&apos;s government propose to take.L. 3. A*5/1/20.COLONIAL OFFICE,
