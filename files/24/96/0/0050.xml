General.Nil.Part II. Departmental.Notes on the Industrial Councils.Although during the past month no great increase has taken place in the number of joint Industrial Councils, progress continues, and the activities of the Councils already in existence have been of considerable interest as regards the future of the movement. Thenew Councils whose formation has been completed during the month are that for theentertainments industry, which covers all interests associated with theatrical, music halland kindred entertainments; the Council for the industrial establishments under thecontrol of the War Office ; and that for the file-making industry.
Prestige must count for much in the activities of the Councils, and this depends greatlyupon the extent to which the various departments recognise the policy expressed on behalfof the Government by Mr. Roberts, when Minister of Labour.  He pointed out that inorder that the Councils might he able to fulfil their duties, and might have the statusrequisite, the Councils should be recognised as the official standing consultative com-mittees to the Government on all questions affecting the industries which they represent,and would be the normal channel for seeking the opinion and experience of an industry on all questions with which the industry is concerned.   Though it has been felt necessaryrecently to remind Government departments of this fact, the experience of the past monthwill show that this function of the Joint Industrial Councils has been by no means over-looked.   It is hardly necessary to draw attention in this connection to the conference heldin December by the Prime Minister with the Building Trade Joint Industrial Council.The Minister of Health has since been in close touch with the Council on the housing problem.The Building Resettlement Committee of the Council had before them, for consideration,the Housing (Additional Powers) Bill, and at the request of the Minister of Health, have appointed two representatives, one from the employers&apos; side and one from the workers&apos;side, to act as expert representatives on the Central Tribunal of Appeal set up under theAct.   The whole attitude of the Building Joint Industrial Council in its effort to solve thedifficulties with which the industry is faced, is evidence of the recognition by one of themost important Councils that its functions go well beyond the settlement of small disputesor questions of wages alone.  Consultation by Government departments is likely to proveone of the most effective means of fostering this spirit.   The Board of Education aretaking active steps to enlist the co-operation of Industrial Councils in the developmentof technical education under the Education Act of 1918, and in conjunction with theCity and Guilds of London Institute special committees have been set up for the purpose,notably by the Silk and the Electrical Contracting Councils. The Joint Industrial Councilshave been consulted also by the Home Office Committee who are investigating the questionof workmen&apos;s compensation.   They have asked for expressions of opinion upon thedesirability of establishing a system of accident insurance under State control or super-vision, and the amount of compensation which should be given whether under the existing system or under a modified system.  This matter has already been considered by the council&apos;s for the Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, the music trades, the quarryingand spelter industries, and the needle, fish hook, fishing tackle and allied trades.  Con-sultation has also taken place between the Safety and Welfare Committee of the council for the quarrying industry and representatives of the Home Office, as to their mutualrelations, and a scheme has been suggested for the establishment of a liaison system whichshould make possible close co-operation in future.  The relations between the admiralty and the Joint Industrial Council for the industrial establishments under the control of that department have been defined on broad lines.  A resolution has been accepted to theeffect that it is in accordance with the spirit in which the Council has been set up that important questions affecting the general objections mentioned in its constitution should,wherever possible, be placed before the Council for consideration before a decision istaken, and that where, owing to the urgency of the occasion, this course is not practicable,the orders issued should be laid before the Council for its information at the next meeting.Four members of the trade union side of this Council also were appointed upon LordColwyn&apos;s Committee to investigate the question of utilising H.M. Dockyards for buildingmerchant ships.It is not to he expected that the application of the principles laid down by the &quot;WhitleyCommittee, especially in the early stages, should proceed in every case with completesmoothness. The last few weeks, have given evidence of the continuance of difficultiesalready encountered. The question of the position of members of organisations represented on the Council, in the face of competitors who refuse to accept the agreements reached bythe Council as to hours and wages, still in one or two instances continues a serious difficulty.The non-observance of such agreements has been complained of by the trade union side-of the Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services Council, where competition hardly entersinto the case. The Council haVe taken steps to collect evidence on this point in order thatthe chairman and vice-chairman may communicate with the local authorities in question.The same question has proved particularly disturbing to the Councils for the rubber manu-facturing industry, the sawmilling industry, and the made-up leather goods trade. Adeputation from the last of these trades was recently received by the Minister, when itwas explained that unless the wages agreements reached by the Council were given theforce of law, the employers&apos; side would refuse to continue on the Council. The suggestion was put forward that, if it was essential that these wages agreements should have com-pulsory powers, a Trade Board should be set up, at any rate for some sections of the
Part III. The Labour and Socialist Press.The Labour Movement.The election of a Labour candidate for the Spen Valley constituency, and the criticism of the Labour Party by the Secretary of State for War in the course of a speech at Sunder-land* these two events are the basis of the greater part of the discussion in this weekspapers on the political future of the Labour Movement. - The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; dis-cusses the meaning of the Spen Valley result in a somewhat incoherent leading article, inwhich the emphasis is put not so much upon the claims advanced that the election qiMr. Myers means the end of the Coalition and of the Liberal Party, but upon the claim thatit was peculiarly an I.L.P., as distinct from a Labour Party, victory. Mr. Philip Snowden,in the same paper, puts even greater emphasis upon this. &quot; Upon our success in thiselection depends our future position in the party.&quot; He insists that recent by-electionresults (Rusholme, St. Albans, Bromley and Spen Valley) show that non-trade unioncandidates appeal to a wider audience than those candidates who are nominees of a particularsection of the working classes, and the claim is implicit in his argument that only the I.L.P.can provide worthy Labour candidates of the former type. Except, however, forthe I.L.P. journals and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; which attributes Mr. Myers&apos; successto a reaction against the anti-Socialism of his opponents rather than to a movement infavour of his own &quot;reformist&quot; proposals, the Spen Valley election as such does not receive independent notice in the Labour and Socialist Press. The political future of theLabour Party as a Avhole is seriously considered in the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; &quot; Justice,&quot;the &quot; Clarion &quot; and the &quot; British Citizen.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; confesses to fearfor the future of the Labour Party, on the ground that, when in power, though it has a goodconstructive programme, it may lack the necessary Parliamentary ability to put that programme into force. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is, however, quite cold to the claims of theI.L.P. to be regarded as the school in which the parliamentary leaders of Labour shouldbe trained, and thinks the Labour party should make more use of its middle class &quot; individual members.&quot; With this object in view, it insists that steps should be taken to place theNational Executive of the Labour Party and the local Labour Parties on an independentfinancial footing as against the trade unions and the I.L.P. In &quot; Justice,&quot; Mr. W. Watsonwrites to refute the theory that the Labour Party, because it is the political expression ofthe organised working class, must eventually become the Socialist Party. Writing underthe inspiration of the so-called &quot; materialist conception of history &quot; he argues that thereign of the Labour Party would mark a further stage of capitalism rather than a,n early* Both events took place on Saturday, 3rd inst.(C 1954) C 2industry. Investigation on these lines by the department is in progress and a further conference will be held at a later stage. A similar suggestion was made to a deputation from the Sawmilling Council who also suggested that a compulsory basis, though it mightbe satisfactory in industries where large concerns were involved, was inadequate in thecase of such ail industry as saw-milling where thousands of small firms enter into coin-petition one with another. Difficulties arising from other causes have been met with inthe elastic webbing industry, where the divergence- of interest between the country manu-facturers and those working in Leicester, on the question of the employment of femalelabour on looms, has resulted in a deadlock and threats of withdrawal, and in the furnish-ing industry where the aftermath of the recent lockout has led the operatives to considerwithdrawal from the Council.Difficulties of this nature may, however, be taken as those normally incident to a movement still in its infancy, and should not affect substantially its prospects. good progress is being made in many directions with the establishment of the district councils and works committees necessary for the complete application of Whitley principles.The York agreement of May last, regarding the position of shop stewards and thecreation of works committees, has now been ratified by the Engineering Employers&apos;Federation and the trade unions concerned, and is having a marked effect in the develop-ment of works committees, in the creation of which the advice and assistance of thedepartment^ officers is continually being sought by both sides of the engineering industry.In general it may be stated that the councils are progressively recognising that their scope is not limited to the settlement of disputes or the determination of wage questions,but that they are concerned with mutual co-operation in the organisation and developmentof the industry in every direction.
stage of socialism, and makes a confident prophecy that the advent of the Labour Partyto power will be accompanied by the formation of a Socialist Party, more comprehensivein character and destined to supersede and destroy the present Labour Party. Mr. A. M.Thompson, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; thinks the evidence of by-election results clear enough to forecast for the next Parliament a Labour minority sufficiently strong to give the Parlia-mentary Labour Party the experience of &quot; active and effective opposition.&quot; He suggeststhat they should secure a change in the procedure of the House of Commons the estabhMi-ment, for example, of a &quot; Foreign Affairs Committee &quot; in order that they might receive more easily the training in Imperial affairs which he thinks to be their greatest need.The &quot; British Citizen &quot; devotes an article to the criticism of the Labour Party. Itis inclined to agree that it is unfitted to assume governmental responsibility, hut not somuch on the ground of incompetence as because it is &quot; divided against itself.&quot; The&quot; Nation &quot; discusses the matter from a purely personal point of view: Mr. Churchill isattacked, Mr. Clynes is praised and the claims of Messrs. Macdonald, Snowden, Webb,Cole, Brailsford, Tawney, Wallas, Mrs. Webb, Miss Macarthur, and Miss Bondfield are somewhat indiscriminately advanced. There is some agreement, however, in all these articles. It is recognised that the Parliamentary Labour Party, as it at present exists,does not contemplate any immediate assumption of government. It is recognised that before it can assume government successfully it must broaden its membership. Theclaims of the I.L.P., however, to consideration in this connection are voiced only by itsown journals the &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks the I.L.P. as narrow a body in outlook,policy and organisation as a great Trade Union, while &quot; Justice &quot; denies the genuineness ofits Socialism.Railwaymen.The General Meeting of the N.U.R. was still considering the Government&apos;s offer whenthe papers reviewed this week went to Press. Mr. Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;extends his sympathy to Mr. Thomas but blames the Government for not making more generous concessions, and ventures to advise the railwaymen to take ample time to disc assthe situation in all its bearings and aspects. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; suggests that theGovernment should drop the sliding-scale part of its proposals. il A hypothetical settle-ment, made to cover conditions which cannot exist for some years, is almost certain tobe upset long before it can come into operation.&quot; Such action on the part of the Govern-menib, thinks this paper, would make possible a compromise on the other points at issue.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; is concerned that the railwaymen should accept no responsibility &quot; for advising as to the management of industry run in the capitalistinterests,&quot; that they should not resign the power of declaring a sudden or a sympatheticstrike, and suggests, in conscious or unconscious ignorance of the way in which it is pro-posed to select the four representatives of &quot; users of railways &quot; on the National wages board, that this Board will be unfairly weighted against the railwaymen. Mr. W. A.Appleton, in the &quot; Democrat,&quot; earnestly recommends the railwaymen to accept the government&apos;s terms.Government Policy.Two points on which the Ministry of Labour meets with criticism may be noted. TheUnemployment Insurance Bill is discussed in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; and by Mr. Snowdenin the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; Mr. Snowden is critical. He does not see any reason whyagricultural workers should be excluded from the Bill, or why any workman should beasked to contribute under the scheme. He thinks the State&apos;s contribution should beincreased in amount in order to enable a larger benefit to be paid. The &quot; BradfordPioneer &quot; is more frankly hostile and describes the Bill as an attempt to buy off Labour&apos;demand for &quot; work or maintenance.&quot; This journal urges that the administration of thescheme will he costly, and fears that the Employment Exchanges may make use of it tosecure &quot; further control of vacancies which have previously been notified to the offices ofTrade Unions.&quot; In contradistinction to the Governmenfs proposals the principle isenunciated that &quot; the maintenance of the unemployed should, in part at any rate, be a charge on the particular industry to which the men in question belong,&quot; but no apprecia-tion is shown of the difiiculties in the way of an unqualified adoption of this rule. Withregard to the benefits proposed, the terms of the Bill are confused with those of the national insurance (Unemployment) Act, 1919.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; refers to the second issue of the Joint Industrial CouncilBulletin which it criticises somewhat unfairly, and takes this opportunity to depreciate thewhole Industrial Council movement. The &quot; Whitley scheme,&quot; in the opinion of this &quot;paper,has manifestly failed.
Part IV.-general Topics.The General Situation.The outstanding feature of the Labour situation this week continues to be the position with regard to the railwaymen&apos;s attitude towards the Government^ terms. The delegateshave during the week of conference opposed their leaders, and the resolutions in whichthey rejected the terms provisionally accepted by their negotiating committee conflictfundamentally with those terms. By far the most important issue is the question of thebasis of standardisation. On this matter the rank and file repeat the demand which wasone of the chief planks in their strike platform, i.e., that the standard wage should be basedon the highest wage existing in any grade, and not on the average&apos;wage, and the leaders have been forced to resile from their provisional agreement with the Government and tovoice the reiterated demand of their followers. The problem of the basis of the authorityof trade union leaders has become a very real one owing to the recent marked developmentof unofficial movements within trade unionism. In addition to the present manifestationsof the revolt of the rank and file of the railwaymen and ironmoulders, it may be rememberedthat in recent weeks, among the miners, the South &quot;Wales rank and file on a ballot voterevolted against their own executive and that of the M.F.G.B. on the question of oppositionto the payment of income tax, and in South Wales also small unofficial counter-campaigns,conducted by conservatives and syndicalists respectively, against the nationalisation ofthe mines have taken place. The unofficial elements among the tin-plate workers havebeen active, and in the engineering and shipbuilding trades the shop steward movementappears to be making progress. And the National Conference of Shop Stewards&apos; and workers&apos; Committees, dealt with elsewhere in this Report, made a vigorous protest againstthe constitutionalism of official trades unionism.The Railwaymen.The special delegate meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen which, when lastweek&apos;s Report was written, was still in session, decided on the 9th inst., after three days&apos;deliberation, to reject the terms offered by the Government for the standardisation ofwages. The meeting accepted the principle of the standardisation of railway work by the elimination of a large number of existing grades, but rejected the Government^ actualproposals because the standard rates were based on the average wage in each grade. Itinstructed its executive to enter into negotiations with the Government for standardised,wages based on, the highest rate of wages plus War wage in each grade concerned. It alsorejected the principle of a sliding scale based on the cost of living on the ground thatthe cost of living, while being a very important factor, is not the only factor on whichwages should be fixed, and would tend to stereotype the present standard of comfort andwould further prevent any improvement being obtained, no matter how the productiveforces of society may be improved.&quot; The Conference also demanded that the settlement should be retrospective to 18th August, 1919, and should apply to Irish railwaymen incorresponding grades, and urged that machinery should be set up to deal with the claims of. railway shopmen and others not included in the settlement. The Conference, in sending the terms back to the Government for reconsideration, announced that it would remainin session until an answer was received. On the 10th inst., Sir Eric Geddes sent a letterto Mr. Thomas to the effect that as the lines of the Government proposals had been laiddown by the Cabinet and the issues involved were of national importance it would benecessary for him to bring the whole matter before his colleagues. He also mentioned that if there were any new considerations which the delegates wished to adduce, he was open to receive these, and would place them before the Government. This letter wasconsidered by the delegate conference and it instructed the negotiating committee to meetthe Minister of Transport with a view to explaining the whole situation. On the 11thinst., the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour went to Paris and there met thePrime Minister and all the available members of the Government. Next morning the two ministers left Paris for London, and on the 13th they had an interview with the NationalUnion of Railwaymen&apos;s negotiating committee. At this conference the representativesof the N.U.R. explained fully the reasons for the rejection of the Governments offer. Atthe close of the interview the negotiating committee returned to Unity House and reportedto the delegate meeting, which later adj adjourned for the day.&apos; On the 14th inst., the negotia-ting committee of the N.U.R. met the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labourand received the reply of the Government.  They reported this to the delegates and it
formed the subject of deliberation. No decision was reached, and. the conference adj ournedtill the following day. On the 15th inst. the delegates decided by a narrow majority toaccept the settlement.Unemployment.&apos; Unemployment still continues to increase in the industries affected by the moulders&apos;strike. During the fortnight to 2nd January the number of ex-service men and women on out-of-work donation increased by 12,415, bringing the total number up to 383,095.In addition to this there were 4,500 ex-service men drawing donation on short-timepolicies, over 4,000 of whom Avere engaged in engineering and ironfounding. The numberof civilians on unemployment insurance has also increased by 15,629, bringing the totalto 133,299 at 2nd January, this increase being entirely confined to men, as the women onunemployment insurance have decreased by 2,000 during the fortnight.The live register for men, which for the first three weeks in December showed but aslight variation, has now increased by over 30,000. This increase is chiefly in the insuredindustries and is more intense in those directly affected by the moulders&apos; strike, engineer-ing and ironfounding having increased by 15,000. The live register for women continuesto fall, though the fall is confined almost exclusively to uninsured industries, particularlydomestic offices and services.The Nationalisation of the Mines.A new lease of life has been given to the Campaign in favour of the nationalisation of the mines, which showed marked signs of flagging, by the shortage of domestic coal andthe increased exports of industrial coal at high prices. The situation was considered by thenational executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, which met in london on the 8th and 9th January, and the decrease in supplies of coal for domestic consumption at home was attributed to the action of the owners in selling a larger volume of coal forexport than they did prior to the 10s. reduction. The Federation expressed its sympathy with the public in the matter and insisted that the situation was in no way due to reducedoutput. It was decided that an interview be sought with the Prime Minister in order thatthe situation, as regards prices and profits and shortage of domestic coal, should be placed before him, and a conference will be held on 29th January to consider the Prime Ministersreply. The miners maintain that their efforts to increase the output of coal are simplyresulting in the exploitation of the foreign market by the coal owners. In South Walesespecially the assertion is freely made that fortunes are at present being made from theexport of coal, and the resentment of the miners is intensified by the fact that, while greatquantities of coal are being shipped from South Wales ports, there is a shortage of domestic coal. This leads to the suspicion that, despite control, the coal follows the lineof highest profit to the coal owner. More than one threat of local &quot; direct action &quot; toprevent the operation of this apparent tendency has been reported. At Goole, forinstance, the Dockers&apos; Union announced on the 10th January that unless better supplies ofcoal for domestic purposes in Goole were forthcoming, they would instruct their members -to refuse to handle any coal for export to France or Belgium or for transport to London..The miners&apos; leaders are preparing to use the whole situation as a fresh plank in the nationalisation platform, arguing that only the complete nationalisation of the mineswill prevent the amassing of private fortunes by coal owners and secure justice for the consumers. In order to bring the nationalisation campaign home to the rank and file ina more intimate way, it is propable that new wage demands will also be made. In SouthWales the high price of coal for export encourages such a demand, and in the North ofEngland the view is maintained that if the sliding scale for determining the wage rate wasin operation coal hewers could be earning 6s. or 7s. per day more than at present. There isno doubt that the introduction of a wage demand into the nationalisation programme,however it might weaken it from the standpoint of logical consistency, would undoubtedlypopularise the campaign in the mind of the miner, to whom the theoretical principle of nationalisation seems very remote from his real life.Cost of Living Index Number.In view of the special interest which is being taken, in connection with the sliding scale which it is proposed to operate in the case of railwaymen&apos;s wages, in the figures withregard to the cost of living published monthly by the Ministry of Labour, it may be well tostate briefly how these statistics are prepared. The figures relate to working-classconditions, and include the prices of food, clothing, fuel and light, as well as rent and other items. Information as to the retail prices of the principal articles of food is collected at thebeginning of each month, by the managers of 660 Employment Exchanges and Branches,
who summarise the quotations obtained from the various retailers in their area. Thefoodstuffs included in the list of principal articles normally account for over three-quarters of the total family expenditure on food, and the inclusion of a greater number of articles of relatively minor importance would not materially affect the average percentage increase.The percentage increases for the separate articles are combined into a general figure to repre-sent the average increase in the level of retail prices by multiplying each percentage by a&apos;&quot; weight &quot; based on the relative importance of the several articles in pre-war working-classbudgets, and dividing the product by the sum of these weights. The pre-war conditions are regarded as the basis of comparison and the extent of the increase in food prices duringthe war is measured by the cost of maintaining the pre-war dietary.In addition to the figures representing the average increase in the level of retail prices, an estimate is made with regard to the average percentage increase in expenditureon the principal articles of food. This estimate is computed by multiplying the per-centage increases for the several articles by &quot; weights &quot; supplied each month by theMinistry of Food, based on the consumption statistics of that Ministry. This expenditureestimate adopts the principle of the &quot; Sunnier &quot; Report, but is seldom used in connexionwith wage adjustments.Information as to increases in rents and rates has been furnished from time to time by the town clerks of about 100 of the principal towns and urban districts. Returns asto the retail prices of articles of clothing and clothing materials are collected throughthe post from representative retailers (some with many branch establishments) in large towns. Statements as to the prices of coal and gas, are obtained monthly from localcorrespondents and checked by special inquiries at intervals. Estimates are alsoobtained from various sources (retailers&apos; public announcements, &amp;c.) as to the increasein prices of other times, including soap, soda, oil, candles, matches, domestic ironmongeryand pottery, newspapers, fares and tobacco, sufficient to enable the Department to judgewhat would be the effect of the increase in prices of these items, taken as a whole, on thegeneral percentage increase for all items.In order to arrive at a single figure representing the increase in the price of all itemstaken together, the percentage increases under each of the main groups of expenditure are combined in the following proportions:-food, 7-1; rent, 2; clothing, 1-1; fuel and light, 1. Allowance is also made for the increase in the price of other items referredto above. The comparison being with pre-war conditions, these pre-war proportionalweights are applied to the percentage increases over the pre-war levels of prices. Theinformation collected is sufficient for tracing the general course of prices from date todate, but is not designed for, and is not sufficient for, measuring the relative cost of living in different areas, which can only be effected by more extensive enquiries.Industrial Courts Act.With reference to the Court of Enquiry under this Act appointed by the Minister to investigate, the conditions of work of dockers and waterside workers, the Council of theLondon Chamber of Commerce at its meeting on the 8th inst., protested against the omission from the Court of representatives of traders, and resolved to ask that at leastfour representatives of trade should be added to the Court. A.meeting of Liverpooldockers has passed a resolution condemning this enquiry, but Mr. J. Sexton has described the meeting as unauthorised. The meeting was convened by a vigilance committee whichhas been formed as a result of discontent in the rank and file of the unions because theirofficials arrange matters of importance without their consent.Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill.A mass meeting was held at Cardiff on the 11th January under the auspices of theSeafarers&apos; Joint Council, and a resolution was passed protesting against the exclusion ofseafarers from the provisions of this Bill. Mr. Havelock Wilson, who presided, said thatthere was every prospect of an international agreement on the question of hours and wages for seafarers. Further meetings in connection with the campaign which the Seafarers&apos;Joint Council is conducting have been held recently at Glasgow and at South Shields.With regard to the position of agriculture, a meeting of the Glasgow District Committeeof the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture passed a resolution in opposition to the inclusionof agricultural workers in the Bill; and at a meeting of the Chepstow Farmers Union thechairman stated that the inclusion of agriculture in the Bill without a clause giving free-dom of contract between employers and men would make the continuance of agricultureimpossible. On the 7th inst. a conference called by the Workers&apos; Union met to considerthe position of agricultural labourers in connection with wages and horns of work.   A
resolution was passed protesting against the proposed exclusion of agricultural workers from the Bill, and expressing the opinion that the provisions of the Bill fully provided forthe circumstances of industry. Mr. Dallas, in the course of an address, stated that agri-cultural labourers wished to be included in the Bill, but did not necessarily want an actualworking week limited to 48 hours. They desired to be included in the Bill so that farmers would have no excuse for keeping men at work without paying them fully. After havingobtained a statutory 48-hour week, arrangements could be made to meet any points of difficulty that might arise.Unemployment Insurance Bill.It is reported that the Shop Assistants Union is obtaining expert opinion on thepossibility of arranging a special scheme for unemployment insurance under this Bill.London Traffic Combine&apos;s Bill.The private Bill lodged by some of the component companies of this Combine for thepurpose of securing sanction, for increased fares will, it is announced, be strongly opposed by Labour organisations. The London District Council of the National Federation ofBuilding Trade Operatives intends to resist in every way the proposal to abolish workmen&apos;sfares and a movement is on foot to encourage Metropolitan Borough Councils to take actionin the matter. The London Labour Party has resolved to oppose the threatened increaseof fares under this Bill.Wages and the Cost of Living.In view of the strong opposition expressed by the railwaymen to the Govern-menfs proposal for the establishment of a sliding scale of wages proportionate tothe cost of living, it is interesting to note that, from the side of the employers,the general system of sliding scales of wages moving in proportion to the cost ofliving is severely criticised in the current issue of &quot; Engineering.&quot; This trade journalmaintains that the artificial regulation&apos; of wages in terms of the cost of living would seriously hamper private industry. It points out that the working-classes with their opposition to piece-work and premium bonus systems seem to feel little enough incentive to increase their output and their wages. In view of the great importance of increasingproduction, this journal asks why we should remove one of the incentives which the work-ing man now has towards increasing production. It draws attention to the fact that manytrade union branches refuse to agree to piece-work or similar systems in which the harderworker is directly rewarded, and suggests that as a small substitute for a system of rewardfor harder work, there is at least the spur of rising costs to help the workman to a greateroutput. The journal continues : &quot; Put out of effect all rises in prices and what has the workman to care for ? So long as he keeps his job it is nothing to him if prices doubleagain. His wages also automatically double, and he is where he was with no effort of hisown. This would be a most unsound condition both from the point of view of the work-man and of the country. The country would lose in output and the workman would losein initiative. A strike is not a desirable social phenomenon, but it is far better that a workman should have to make an effort if he wishes to raise his wages, even if the efforttakes the form of a strike, than that he should simply have to do nothing at all, and thatwith a rise in prices, with no effort or thought from him, his wage would rise as the sunrises on each new day.&quot;Trade Unionism and the Co-operative Movement.There is evidence that a section of the co-operative movement object to the recentagreements which have been made between the co-operative societies and trade unions forthe supply of foodstuffs during strikes. The co-operative societies include a considerablenumber of members who do not belong to the working classes and. whose politics are notLabour, and these resent the tendency of the co-operative movement to become the toolof trade unionism. Thus, at a recent meeting of the Co-operative Wholesale Society at manchester, it was stated that no money whatsoever would be given during a strike fromthe Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s bank to trade unions or even to distributiveco-operative societies without good security. The Co-operative Wholesale Society isadvertising a forthcoming issue of  5,000,000 of Development Bonds bearing 5-g- per cent-interest for five years ana 6 per cent, for ten years, and special facilities are being grantedto trade unions to take up these bonds.   That the extremist section in the Labour
&quot;movement have an eye to the advantages that would accrue from the possession of controlover the Co-operative Societies may be gauged from the advice of Mr. J. Thurgood, a delegate of the London Central Council, to the national conference of the Shop $towards&apos;and Workers&apos; Committees on the 10th January, that all workiag men should get into theCo-operative movement, and thus secure a hold on it so that it might be used to theirliking when the time came.Russia.At a meeting in Sheffield recently under the auspices of the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot;campaign, Mr. Coates, the Secretary of the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committee, stated thatthe Committee had circularised 600 Trades and Labour Councils in the country with regardto the action to be taken in connection with the attitude of the British Government towardsRussia and that it had received 400 replies favouring direct action to secure immediatepeace with Soviet Russia.The&quot; Daily Herald.&quot;The circulation of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot;is increasing. It is stated that the certifieddaily sales from 31st. March to 27th September were 208,879, and from 29th September to 1st November, 290,595. The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; has stated that in all 250 committees are at work in connection with its Development Fund Campaign, and it has given a list of225 of these. The Central Committee for Manchester is inaugurating a big campaign to secure  100,000 towards the Fund required, among other things, to start a Manchesteredition. A deputation of the Directors of this paper met the Parliamentary Committeeof the Trades Union Congress on the 7th January, and invited the Committee to supportthe scheme for the development of the paper.Housing.It is reported that a special delegate conference of the/National Federation ofBuilding Trade Operatives is being summoned to consider the shortage of working-classhouses and the suggestion that dilutees should be introduced to augment the availablelabour. Discontent with housing conditions is specially prevalent among ex-Service men.These men, in many cases, have been unable to obtain houses since their demobilisation)and have been forced to live with their families in rooms, or to lodge with their own or their wives&apos; parents, and the resulting congestion has naturally caused much dissatisfaction, and,even where ex-Service men have returned to their homes, the unsatisfactory nature of the&quot;accommodation provided has been borne in upon them with a special force after the cleanand open-air conditions of army life. Also there is no doubt that, during the discomfortof active service, many soldiers idealised home life, and the apparent impossibility ofrealising their ideals in a large number of cases has embittered their outlook.Shop Steivards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committees.    iA two days&apos; national conference of Shop Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committees tookplace in London on the 10th and 11th January, with Mr. Arthur MacManus as chairman,and a large number of extremist resolutions were discussed and carried. The agenda ofthe Conference followed the lines of the issues discussed at the special Trades Union congress in December, but on most points the Shop Stewards went much further than the TradesUnion Congress. In place, of mere nationalisation, for instance, the Conference passed aresolution &quot; calling upon the organised Labour Movement to strive for the confiscation ofthe mines, railways, and other means of production and distribution in the interests of thecommunity,&quot; and declared that for the purposes of control of the forces of productionand distribution by the workers the Soviet or Workers&apos; Committee form of organisation is the best. On the motion of the West London Workers&apos; Committee, a resolution wascarried demanding a six-hour day, five days per week, so as to absorb all the unemployed in every industry, and also a minimum wage of  l per day. With regard to the cost ofliving, it affirmed that the scheme for Government subsidies adopted by the Trades UnionCongress was a &quot; vicious expediency,&quot; and called on the local and national organisations of the workers to prepare economic machinery and accept full responsibility for the welfare of society. The conference sent greetings to the Russian Soviet Republic andenthusiastically welcomed the &quot; splendid constructive work for Communism accomplishedby the Soviets.&quot;  It also advocated a general strike to force the Government to stop all
forms of intervention in Russia, and to establish peace with Soviet Russia. It was also decided to affiliate with the Third (Moscow) International. At the close of the conference the chairman announced that the 63 delegates present represented over 76,970 workers.This organisation is one of the most important, and certainly the most vigorous, of the rank and file movements which are in revolt against the constitutional methods of officialtrade unionism.Amalgamation.The amalgamation has recently been completed, under the title of the United VehicleWorkers, of the Amalgamated Society of Tramway and Vehicle Workers, the London and provincial Licensed Vehicle Workers, the Amalgamated Carters, Lorrymen and Motor-men^ Union, and the Halifax and&apos;District Carters, Draymen and Horsemen&apos;s Associa-tion. With reference to the projected amalgamation of the Amalgamated Union ofCo-operative Employees and the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Ware-housemen and Clerks, the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress is toreceive a deputation. In the negotiations for this amalgamation a good deal of difficulty has arisen from the peculiar position of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees.It is reported that the Portsmouth Tailors&apos; Cutters and Salesmen&apos;s Association and theChemists Assistants&apos; Association of Limerick, Cork and Waterford have joined the shop assistants&apos; Union. It is announced that the National Union of Government Employees,a dockyard organisation, is to amalgamate with the Workers&apos; Union and representativesof the National Amalgamated Workers Union and the National Union of General workers have also recently met to consider amalgamation. The scheme for amalgamation agreedupon by the representatives of the United Garment Workers Union and the ScottishOperative Tailors and Tailoresses&apos; Association is now before the members and will be finally voted upon during the present month. Negotiations are proceeding for amalga-mation between the Amalgamated Society of Pharmacists, Druggists and Chemical workers and the National Association of Chemists&apos; Assistants.National Union of Clerics.It is reported that in South Wales the local members of the National Union of Clerksare pressing for a complete reorganisation of the Union. There are three or four stapleindustries in South Wales, and it is claimed that unless the clerks are attached to theworkmen&apos;s organisation in these industries the value of the association to its members willbe limited. It is therefore being suggested that a series of industrial guilds for clerksshould be set up which would be affiliated to the appropriate trade organisation for theindustry and federated under a Clerks&apos; District Administrative Council. The impulse tothis suggested reorganisation came from negotiations with the South Wales Miners&apos;Federation which expressed willingness to enter into an alliance with a Guild of CollieryClerks, but would have no dealings with a general union of clerks. Similar guilds are proposed for the iron and steel trades, ship repairing, shipping, milling, brewing, &amp;c.The future development of organisation on these lines will be watched with interest.. Ex-Service Men.International Union of Ex-Service Men. Mr. James Cox, National Secretary of thisUnion, in a letter to the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; of the 3rd January, states that his union will be very pleased to participate in the &quot; International of Ex-Soldiers &quot; proposed by M.Raymond Lefebve, Vice-President of the French Republican Association of Ex-Soldiers.In his letter, Mr. Cox declares that his union is &quot; an out and out revolutionary socialistorganisation,&quot; and quotes from the published platform of the Union, according to whichit &quot; seeks to establish an industrial republic and to work in co-operation with the Workers&apos;Committees throughout the country, in order to form sailors&apos;, soldiers&apos; and workers&apos; councilswith a view to taking over the means of production, distribution and exchange and therebyfreeing the workers from wage slavery and exploitation.&quot; The extremist attitude of thisUnion has previously been referred to in this Report. It is, however, a small union, whose activities, in spite of its emphasis on internationalism, are largely confined to Scotland,and its importance is not likely to increase.

The employers&apos; federations representing,the North-Western and South-Western Areas, the Southern Counties and the london district have protested to the Department against the decision of the National Board of conciliation bringing into operation a 44-hour week from the 1st May, 1920. The protestwas. made mainly on the ground that the National Board had no jurisdiction on the matter.The federations concerned have been informed that the question of approval of the decision by the Department no longer arises and that the question as to the jurisdiction of theNational Board appears a matter for consideration in the first instance by the trade itself.The operatives coming under the South-Western Building Trades Area Scheme have applied for a further advance as from the 1st May, 1920. A number of the smaller masterbuilders&apos; associations affiliated to the South-Western Building Trade Employers&apos; Federa-tion are stated to be considering withdrawal from the federation on the ground that rateslaid down in the Area Scheme are not binding on non-federated employers. (See alsolast weeFs Report, page 6.)Joint Industrial Councils.Cable Making. On the 8th January, the Council discussed the position of non-associated firms in regard to wages agreements reached by the Council. The unions arebringing pressure to bear on these firms.Hosiery.-Ou the 8th January the Council renewed a previous decision refusing repre-sentation to general labour unions.Rubber Manufacturing. A deputation from the Council have pointed out the difficultyof enforcing on non-associated firms agreements made by the Council, which was leadingamong the associated firms to a tendency to break away from the association. It was.suggested that a trade board might be set up side by side with the Council and the suggestionis to be considered later.Trade Boards Division,Paper Bag Trade Board.-k notice of proposal has been issued to vary the generalminimum time-rates and overtime rates in respect of certain classes of male workers.

The followingnotes are based on the divisional reports of the work of Local Employment committees for the week ending the 2nd January, 1920.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. The gravity of the unemployment situation is being viewed withapprehension by many employment committees in this area, and as a result renewedrepresentations are being made to local authorities, urging them to begin road repairs andother public works. At Brighton, extensive work on road repairing is already underway and operations on the housing scheme and house refuse disposal works will shortlybegin.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Employment of Ex-Sewice Men. Bradford Employment Committee support theresolution of the Workington Committee in favour of the insertion of a compulsory clause in all Government contracts to the effect that all contracting firms must have their nameson the National Roll.Wagon Repairing Trade. An extensive enquiry into the conditions in the wagon re-pairing trade at Doncaster, Rotherham, Sheffield, Chesterfield; Long Eaton and LangleyHill indicate that there is in some cases an acute shortage of wagon repairers and that development is also prevented by lack of housing accommodation, It wouid appear,however, that work generally is being delayed, pending the declaration of the government&apos;s policy with regard to the ownership and construction and repair of railway wagons.Other Districts.There is nothing to report from other districts.Paet VI. Disputes.(a) Demands and Negotiations. -Building and Allied Trades.Brickniakers: Nottingham. Although a settlement on the wages question was reachedonly a few months ago, the men are now agitating for a further increase of 2d. per hour. Theemployers have agreed to submit the question to arbitration.Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding.Tinplate Workers: South Wales.-It is stated that the Welsh tin platers have put indemands for a 50 per cent, increase in wages.
(b) Strikes and Lockouts.Building Trade Operatives: Worcester. The expected strike in the Worcester building trade took place on the 10th inst., the number of men affected being between 500 and 700.The cause of the strike is the demand of Worcester operatives that the town should be placedon Grade B under the Conciliation Board&apos;s Scheme. This was granted, but the masters refusedto pay the increase necessary to bring wages up to the rate fixed for this grade on the groundthat they never acquiesced in the Area Scheme as a whole, and are, therefore, entitled to repudiate any particular decision come to with regard to it by the Board.Mining and Quarrying.Miners: Derbyshire. A lightning strike took place at the Pinxton Collieries on Saturdayover the refusal of the owners to allow the men to work three and a half hours on Saturdays, andto receive the full war wage for the day. Nearly 3,000 men and boys are involved. The menvoluntarily returned to work last Monday.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Ironfounders&apos; Strike.-An. attempt to overcome the position created by the adverse ballotof last week has been made on both sides. At the request of the Moulders Unions theGeneral Workers: Engineering Trades. An application has been made to the National and engineering Employers&apos; Federation on behalf of the members of the National Federation ofGeneral Workers for improved wages and hours. The representatives of the Unions and theEmployers&apos; Federation will consider this application at a conference at York to be held onthe 14th, 15th and 16th inst. The chief feature of these demands is the claim that all war wagesshall be merged into a standard rate, together with the 12^ per cent, bonus, while it is asked that district rates be levelled up. Under the head of holidays, there is a demand that &quot; MayDay be recognised as a general holiday &quot; and pay for all statutory holidays is asked for, as wellas pay for a continuous week&apos;s holiday, and double time for all work during recognised holidays.Textile Trades.Cotton Spinners: Holidays Negotiations. A conference between representatives of the master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation, the Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association andthe United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association was held on the 8th inst. at Manchester toconsider the operatives&apos; request for full pay during annual holidays. The employers decidedthat it was impossible to grant this. It is probable that the operatives&apos; association will not let the matter rest here, but will continue to press for full payment during holiday periods.Weavers: Bonus Question. It is now generally expected that operative weavers employed, in the spinning departments of mills owned by members of the Cotton ,Spinners and Manu-facturers Association will be granted bonuses on the same lines as those granted to cotton spinnersby the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners, but that the amounts offered will be considerably less.Transport.Railwaymen. See Part IV.Bakery Vanmen: Glasgow. A strike of drivers of bakery vans who are members of theScottish Horse and Motormen&apos;s Union is threatened in regard to a wages demand. It is hopedthat both parties will consent to take the case to arbitration, but at present the employers are opposed to this course.Vehicle Workers : Blyth. At a meeting of the National Union of Vehicle Workers and allied Workers held at Blyth on the 8th inst. a resolution was unanimously adopted deciding to demand advances ranging from 25s. to 30s. a week with Is. Qd. an hour overtime pay anddouble time on Sundays. It was also stated that the men would be prepared to withdraw their labour if necessary to enforce these demands.Paper, Printing, dc, Trades.Printers: Folkestone. In connection with negotiations for advances in wages, Folkestoneprinters have accepted, without prejudice, an offer of the employers to pay  3 a week.Negotiations are still continuing, and it is possible that a strike may take place.Miscellaneous.Waiters. The waiters&apos; dispute still remains unsettled owing to the attitude of the employerstowards the recognition of the Union. The latter has presented a petition to the Prime Ministerasking for a public enquiry into the wages and conditions of hotel and restaurant employees.
Engineering Employers&apos; Federation agreed to send representatives to a joint conference whichwas held at York on the 12th inst. It was decided at this meeting that the Trade union executives should convene a delegate conference.at Manchester on the 15th inst., so that thewhole position as it now stands may he placed before the various branches. The proposals put forward by the employers at the York Conference were not made public, but it is understoodthat they submitted fresh terms which will be considered by the moulders&apos; delegate meeting onthe 15th. . So far as the men are concerned, a proposal originally put forward by the BugbyJoint Strike Committee is said to have found considerable favour. This suggests the institution,of an impartial Court of Inquiry whose terms of reference should be as follows * (1) To enquire into the working conditions in foundries.(2) To enquire and ascertain the amount of profits made in the founding industry from august, 1914, to September, 1919.(3) On the findings of clauses 1 and 2, the Court to adjudicate on the justifiability ofthe men&apos;s demands for a 15s. per week increase in wages, the decision to be regarded as an arbitration award which shall be equally binding on employers and workmen.It is suggested further that a ballot should be taken on the subject and that, if this resultedin a demand for the enquiry the men should resume work pending the establishment andfindings of such a Court. There is evidence to show that the result of last week&apos;s ballot causedconsternation in some districts, and that a considerable number of men who voted in favour ofresuming on the terms arranged between the Executives and the employers have actually goneback to work. In view, therefore, of the general desire to terminate the dispute, it seems possiblethat further progress towards a final settlement will be made at this week&apos;s meeting.Cbthing Trades.Hosiery Workers: (Hawick). A strike of rib frame workers employed in the hosiery trade-at Hawick took place on the 6th inst. for an advance of 10s. per week.  The strike is unofficialand the men have ignored the suggestion of the employers that the latter should enter into negotiations with the Union.Transport.Dockers: (Barry).&apos; A strike of dockers took place at Barry on Friday over a refusal on thepart of the men to load a ship which was manned by German sailors.  The matter has had to-be communicated to the headquarters.of the Dockers Union in London.Leather Trades.] fjLeather Workers: (Glasgow). A strike of leather bag and portmanteau makers has occurred!in Glasgow on the question of wages and hours. The present minimum rate for men was fixed:by the Joint Industrial Council at Is. 5d. per hour for a working week of 48 hours. The men now demand a minimum rate of 2s. per hour and a 44-hour week. About 70 employees are affected.Insurance Agents Pearl Assurance Company, Ltd. It is reported that this strike has-extended during the week, and that the number of agents who are out is estimated at nearly3,000. The strike has the support of the Press, and the Workers&apos; Union has placed its offices,organisation and funds at the disposal of the National Amalgamated Union of AssuranceWorkers.  Among the offers of financial assistance is that of the &quot; Daily Mail,&quot; which proposes -to pay  1,000 a week to the Workers&apos; Union earmarked for the agents on strike.(c) Settlements.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Patternmakers: (Scotland). A&apos;strike of patternmakers at Kirkcaldy and on the Firth ofForth, which has lasted for six weeks, was settled on the 10th inst.  The strike originated through -the refusal of the employers to concede the terms^of the national settlement.  They have now agreed to this.Leather Trades.Leather Workers: (Nottingham). A strike of the employees at Messrs. Thomas Bayley &amp;:Co.&apos;s works which took place on the 5th inst. over the dismissal of one of the workers, was settled.on the 7th inst., when the company agreed to reinstate the man who had been discharged.
^       -Professional.\ Colliery Clerks: (Main Collieries, Neath). The strike of clerks employed at these collieries,which took place on the 5th inst., was settled on. the 7th inst. The management agreed to refer the grievances of the staff to a specially convened meeting of the Joint Wages Board, while thecase of the dismissed clerk, Mr. Llewellyn, is to be dealt with specially by a Court of Arbitra-tion. The men who struck allege that the discharge of this man was due to his efforts to get anew scale of salaries adopted for colliery clerks, and that it was a case of victimisation.R. S.
