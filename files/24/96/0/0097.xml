JDlllLPpcument is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.egypt&amp; I M f.....v., 1CBM0RAMDPM BY THE PRESIDENT OF TO BOARD OP TRADERfeHADCS*^Sn July 1917 my predecessor appointed a Committeeto investigate the host means of developing tho growing ofcotton within the Empire and to advise the Government as tothe necessary measures to he taken for this purpose&quot;.&apos;   TheCommittee, of which Sir Henry BirChenough is Chairman, consists of representatives of the Foreign, Colonial and India Offices,and the Governments of India, Australia and South Africa, ofthe Liverpool Cotton Association, the British Cotton GrowingAssociation, Indian Cotton interests and the principleassociations of employers and employed concerned in the industryin the  United Kingdom.    The Committee has appointed a numberof sub-committees including co-opted members, for theconsideration of particular aspects of the problem before it.2.    The Committee/has now presented an oxhaustive report which will ohortly^eotpublished, giving a comprehensivesurvey of the present position of Cottonsgrowing&apos;within theEmpire and of the possibilities of its expansion,with detailed recommendations as to the action to be tafcsn in each part ofthe Empire in win&apos;ch cotton can be grown, and the part to betaken by the Government of the United Kingdom and the cottonindustry there.3.    It is unnecessary for me to dwell on the importanceof the cotton industry or its present dependence upon non-British sources of supply of raw cotton.    Briefly the positionis that before the War the United Kingdom consumption ofraw cotton annually was about 4,000,000 bales, and four-fifths of this was of grades of which the United States has a practicalmonopoly.    The supply from the United States is likely to be adversely affected by (1) Increasing domestic consumption and&apos;(2) economic changes tending to check the extension and possibly even to cause a permanent reduction of cotton-growing there.The remaining one-fifth of the United Kingdom Consumption was of the finer grades, produced chiefly in Egypt, but also in theUnited States (Sea Island etc.) and to a limited extent in theBritish West Indies, the Sudan, and British Possessions in africa.    Of these finer grades the world1s production is comparatively small (only some if million bales out of a world1 total of all grades of over 25 million bales); and of thisworld&apos;s product ion Lancashire has in recent years taken nearly one-half, since the tondenoy of the British industry has been for a number of years to specialize in the finer and morovaluable branches of manufacture.    AH tho sources of supplyof the finer grades have suffered severely during the war, andthe immediate prospects are not promising.      Of the large Indianproduction of raw cotton, which is of a low grade, the UnitedKingdom takes practically nothing.4.    The Empire Cotton Growing Committee express themselves as confident &quot;that if proper measures are taken it would bepossible to grow within the Empire at&quot;any rate a vory largeproportion of the cotton it requires&quot;.    Elsewhere they state&quot;The problem of increasing the Yforld* s supply of cotton fromthe natural sources available in the British Empire is in no way insoluble.    Good beginnings have already been made.    future developments may be confidently expected, If our proposals are found to be acceptable;   and if adequate funds are provided by theImperial Government, the Colonial Governments, and the BritishCotton Industry.    In a few places no phenomenal incroasoin the cotton supply can be looked for.Progress
Progress, tftnigh it may aB a whole he great, will ho gradualand would depend on patient and persevering work in everysuitable locality&quot;.5.    The general recommendations of the Conriittoc, apartfrom those relating&apos;to the action to be taken in particularparts of the Empire, may be summarized as follows?-(1)   That the Empire Cotton Growing Committeebe authorised to continue its work on tho general linesof the present report, and that a grant bo made to it of a sum of not less than  10,000 per annum for 5 years,for secretarial and other expenses and any outlaynecessary for initiatory work in directions connectedwith theob3 sets of the Committee(2)   That to supplement the uresent knowledgeof scientific -principles rnc-on growing,a Central Research Institute bo established as soon aspossible in some central and appropriate position,,(3)   That provision be made for at least fourReaderships at British Universities in appropriatebranches of botany and that a system of researchstudentships be established - this in order todevelop an adequate supply of trained men for the Re-search Institute and for scientific posts connectedwith cotton-growing in various parts of the Empire..(4 )   That the Committee should establish a Bureaufor interchange of knowledge of cotton growing andfor the publication of a Quarterly Review devotedto this matter.(5)   That an agreement should be negotiated withthe   British Cotton Growing Association in accordancewith which that body would act as agent for theEmpire Cotton Growing Committee for marketing cropswhere this is desired by the Government of anyCotton Growing area within the Empire.(6)   That funds for the promotion of cottongrowing in the Empire&apos;should&quot;be provided from (a)the   British Treasury; (b) Local revenues of cottongrowing areas:   and (c) the Cotton Industry:be accepted and that the followinas a guide in discussion end negotiations as toallocation of financial responsibility;(a)   The   British Treasury may fairly be,looked to:-(i)   To provide for the secretarial and estab-lishnc-nt&apos; charges of the Empire CottonGrowing Committee ana for outlay forinitiatory work;(ii)   To contribute in agreed proportiontowards expenditure upon schemes approved,by the Committee which have for their object the -provision of the supply ofraw cotton;   and
(iii)   To assist the Governments of colonies and Protectorates either by grants or more probably by gasa?an$oe to provide funds&apos;for publio works nocessary for&apos;thedevelopment of their resources.(b)      That whero developments, although in theirinception connected with cotton growing, are calculated to extend the general prosperity of a colony or Protectorate, they should as a rale bofinanced by the local Government conccrno-d.(o)      That where tho growing of cotton ispormitted in preference to other profitable crops, andwhero pioneer work is undertaken in order to ascertain whether cotton   can be grown profitably, the con-sequential expenditure should bo borne by the CottonIndustry.6.    I strongly recommend that the proposals of the Committeeshould be approved generally by Eis*Ma3estyTs Government, and the requisite funds provided.    In this connection there liasarisen a grave question of Imperial policy, namely, that ofthe disposal of the surplus funds accruing under the eygptian cotton&apos;Control Scheme, which it is estimated will amount tosome 4,000,000 pounds sterling.7.    When the Egyptian Cotton Control Scheme was originallyunder consideration (in February and March 1918) it wasspecifically stated by the Treasury to the Foreign Officeand the Board of Trade that they would not agree to theprinciple that if any profits accrued from the scheme these should all go to Egypt.    The Treasury pointed out that.theUnited Kingdom was to bear half of any loss there might bofrom the scheme, and it would be inequitable if tho UnitodKingdom were to be excluded from sharing in any profit.    Whentho scheme was adopted a memorandum was furnished by theBoard of Trade to the Foreign Office (March 25th-, 1918),placing - on record the arrangement arrived at with theEgyptian  Government, one of the provisions being that should there be any eventual loss on the operation of thecontrol, such loss should be shared oqually between HisMajesty*s Government and the Egyptian Government, whilstany eventual surplus was to be disposed of ultimately byagreement between the two   Governments.    In July, 1919when the control was drawing to an end the Board of trade had under consideration the method of providing funds for the promotion of Empire   Cotton Growing on the lines already suggested and now definitely   formulated by the EmpireCotton Growing Committee, and it appeared to the Chancellorof the   Exchequer and myself that the establishment of somecapital fund analogous to that established for the purposesof the   Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,would be the most expedient course.8.     There were two sources from which such a fund might be constituted;-(a)    W
rj ti $(a)   The Burplus of the contributions of employersand workpeople to the Unemployment Fund Scheme in theLancashire Cotton Trade, established and operatedduring the war by the Cotton Control Board;(b) The surplus of the Egyptian Cotton ControlScheme,9,    As regards   (a) it is possible that some amount may be forthcoming from the fund in question, with the consentef the interests concerned (the fund ia not one over whichHis  Majesty1s Government have any control) and that furthersums will be provided,in some other way (e.g. by a voluntarylevy) by the Lancashire   Industry, but a practically essential condition is that a substantial amount shall also becontributed by His Majesty1 s Government.10.   As regards (b,)I consulted with the chancellor of theExchequer and it was agreed that in order to give effectto the principle laid down when the Egyptian Cotton schemewas adopted as to the sharing of any profit, the egyptian government might properly be asked that the surplus accruingfrom the operate ons of the Egyptian Cotton Control should be apportioned equally between the British and Egyptian Governmentsi.e. that the principle which has been agreed upon as to thopossible loss should be applied to the realised surplus.Out of its own share (about  2,000,000) the Egyptian government might reasonably be expected to devote one-half to thofurtherance of Egyptian  Cotton Growing.    Out of the sharewhich would accrue to the United&apos;Kingdom and bo paid intothe   isschequer as extra receipts, the Chancellor&quot;of the;E.;$ hequer undertook to invite Parliament to provide a sum of 1,000,000 for the purpose of promoting Cotton Growing throughoutthe Empire generally.    It was hoped that in this way, with the contribution from the industry in the United Kingdom, therewould be constituted a capital fund of at least  2,000,000available for carrying out the schemes of tho Empire CottonGrowing Committee, and we agreed that there should be no furtherclaim in this respect upon the -Exchequer.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer further undertook that nis promise to ask parliament to provide a sum of  1,000,000 out of the share of theEgyptian Cotton profits accruing to His Majesty1s Government wasnot contingent upon the Board of Trade succeeding in obtaining a contribution out of the surplus of the Lancashire UnemploymentFund.11.   The Egyptian Government and the foreign Office takestrong exception, however, to the proposal that any portion ofthe Egyptian Cotton Scheme surplus should accruo to the british exchequer.    In a telegram of the 1st August, Lord Allenby urgedthat the profit had been made at the expense of the eygptian cotton-grOwer and that consequently Egypt was entitled to thewhole sum, and that the action suggested would have a very bad effect in Egypt.    In support of this view the foreign office have stated,that one of the most serious alleged grievancesexploited by the Nationalists in Egypt was the constitution and operation of the Cotton Control Commission which was declared tobe acting solely in the interests of the British manufacturers, andthat this allegation was very generally believed in Egyptianagricultural circles.      The Foreign Office further argue thaton
on general grpunds of equity profits made entirely at the expenseof the Egyptian cotton-growers should he devoted to the furtherance of Egyptian interests.I must however, point out that the whole scheme was .jointly guaranteed by the British and Egyptian Governments;   thatthe British Government was prepared to bear half of any loosincurred fat one time such a loss appoarod probable) and thatthe principle that the oblication to&quot;share a possible losscarried with it the right to share in any profit has not beendisputed until now.    I cannot accept the view that the profitwill have been made at the expense of the Egyptian cotton growers,who throughout the period of control were guaranteed a goneroueprice which was fixed at the outset by agreement between the twoGovernments.      The contention also put forward by. the ForeignOffico that the effect of the control was to compel theEgyptian growers to dispose of their cotton at a lower pricethan that which they would otherwise have roalised may representthe view held in Egypt, hut it ignores the importance of theguarantee to the cotton growers at the time the scheme was established and tho fact that for a time the market price might have fallen to a figure below tho guaranteed price.I must also point out that the success of the Egyptianscheme has been due to a very considerable extent to the large amount of voluntary and unpaid work performed in this country by members of the Egyptian Official :Values Committee and thoCotton Control Board, and that a substantial sum - not less than 850.000 - should in respect of these services be debited tothe Egyptian   Cotton Surplus.12.   I understand that the   Chancellor of the Exchequer is infull agreement with myself on this matter J upon which I shouldbe glad of the earliest possible decision, as the report of theCommittee has now been published and arrangements have been made bythe Committee for an active compaign in Lancashire in supportof its proposals, and with a view to securing substantialfinancial assistance from the industry, and an announcement ofthe intention of the Government also to give financial support would have a very potent influence on this campaign.13.   The points on which decisions are necessary are accordingly:-1.   Whether the proposals of the Empire CottonGrowing Committee should be given the general approvalof His Majesty&apos;s Government.2.   The claim of the British (government upon ashare of the profits of the Egyptian Cotton Scheme.3.   Whether in the event of a sum less than one-halfof tho Egyptian Cotton surplus being&apos; obtained the amountgranted for Empire Cotton Growing should be  1,000,000or snme smaller amount.4.    In any event, will the Cabinet at once authorisethe grant of  10,000 a year for 5 years asked for by theEmpire Cotton Growing Committee to ertend its organiBa-tion  and work?    This, at least, is essential to enablethe campaign in  Lancashire to be starred with anannouncement of Government approval and support.A.C. GEBI33S.
