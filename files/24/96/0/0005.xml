The present proposal to pay ll/- represents anincrease therefore, of practically 50 per cent.     Beyond questionsof improvements to be required in the medical services it is claim that the Doctors will now be called upon to provide increasedservices for discharged and demobilised men.Medical Referees - Consultants ,. Proposals for a scheme of medical referees were made, so long ago as 1914 and provision was made in the estimates for the year1914/5 but owing to the War the scheme never matured.     It isproposed to revive the scheme for 192o/l.     The total cost forGreat Britain is expected to be approximately  180,000, of which not   ore than  75,000 can be charged to insurance Funds, leavingabout  105,000 to be provided by the Exchequer.-Special Note as to Sanatorium Benefit,It must be borne in mind that if local Authorities are tobe required to provide Sanatorium Benefit for insured      well &apos;asuninsured persons, they will demand a larger contribution to thei:y&quot;&apos;*&apos;&apos; - .-&apos;      &apos; . fund:^^^^^fibnua&apos; IncMttetf -hereitf- ta^-nofc-psid at a flat rate.
