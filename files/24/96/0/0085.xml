This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Grovenpem]confidential the CABINET.CENSUS OP THE POPULATION.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. I desire to support the proposal of the Minister of Health, circulated in CP. 309,that a bill should be introduced enabling censuses to be taken every five years.2. Correct vital statistics are essential to the proper solution of recruiting andman-power problems. During the war these statistics could be obtained as a result of theNational Registration Acts, 1915-1918, but the Registers instituted under these Acts,which only held good &quot; during the continuance of the present war and no longer,&quot; havenot been kept up since the Armistice. Consequently, the census is now the onlymachinery for obtaining the necessary statistics, and these would be secured with muchgreater accuracy by a quinquennial than by a decennial census, the statistics from whichwould be quite out of date before those from the succeeding census were available. Aquinquennial census would also largely reduce liability of error in estimates forintercensal periods.3. It is proposed in CP. 309 that the particulars of information required from the census returns should be settled by Order in Council after the principle of aquinquennial census has received Parliamentary sanction. The particulars essential froma military point of view are: Sex.Age.Whether married or single.Conditions of health (in so far as they are arrived at by statisticalpercentages).Areas of habitation.Occupation.With regard to &quot;areas of habitation&quot; the War Office would be glad to be consulted before any departure from the existing County basis is authorized.With regard to &quot;occupation&quot; it is desired that the particulars should be shown under a group system, on the lines adopted for demobilization purposes.4. The.se details, the inclusion of which can, if necessary, be justified on jion-military grounds, can be settled between the departments concerned when the orders in Council come to be drafted.5. In conclusion, I desire to point out for the information of my colleagues that should any Military Service Act be passed in a future emergency it will be impossibleto administer it until reasonably accurate vital statistics are available.WINSTON S.
