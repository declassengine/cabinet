Jus Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;&quot;3        Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.EXPORT PRICES OF BRITISH COAL TO FRANCE AND ITALY.THE points raised by the Secretary of State for Foreign&quot;Affairs in his memorandumunder the above heading are obviously of the first importance.I agree with him when he indicates that the present high export prices for coalare pregnant with unpleasant results. Unfortunately, these are to be anticipated notonly in our foreign relations but in our economic and industrial affairs at home. Iam afraid that a possible solution is hard to find.The position with regard to coal, which I inherited when I went to the Board ofTrade last May, was then, and is still, One of great difficulty. What is palled the CoalControl is really Control of Inland Distribution and Internal Price of Coal.-The export prices of coal for Allies were controlled during the war under a defence of the Realm regulation, but that power could not be relied on now.The new Coal Control, which has been created since August last, has not yet hadan opportunity of putting forward any policy which was not in fact imposed upon it by the actions of its predecessor. It is now becoming possible to pull out of themorass nr-tributable to a variety of circumstances, and I have some hope of the future,even whh regard to peace in the coal industry.Nothing less than the industrial stability of the country is involved in thesolution of the coal problem which is adopted, and I would urge the Cabinet not totake a decision on any part of this important matter until it has had an opportunity of considering proposals which I hope to be in a position to lay before it at an early date.The principal points made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his memorandum are as follows : 1. The export price of British coal is not at present a market price in the propersense of the word.My answer is that the price is as much the world market price for coalas the prices paid by us for commodities purchased in the world marketare market prices.2. The Government control the price of coal, and are under suspicion by theAllies of taking advantage of the situation to profiteer.My answer is that the Government do not in fact control the price ofexported coal. In May last, in pursuance of the general policy of removingwar restrictions in order to facilitate the return to more normal conditions,the control of export price was discontinued. A schedule of minimum prices was substituted for the schedule of fixed prices which had previously been in operation, but the minimum prices have no real relation to theprices actually obtained for coal exports.3. Italy has no source of supply except the United Kingdom.My answer is that the American returns for the month of Septemberlast showed that Italy imported 400,000 tons from America; and, no doubt,as soon as conditions again become settled in America, Italy will continueto import from America. Recently Italy has been taking no more than400,000 tons a month from Britain, but she could have more if she could find the shipping. *4. There is a threat of reprisals.   It is not thought that this is a serious danger.05. &quot; Under the Peace Treaty, Germans are to be allowed to charge for the coal which they have to supply to France and Italy a price as high (though itmay not be higher) as &apos; the pit-head price&apos; of British coal for export.&apos;&apos;
The foregoing is not a complete statement of the terms of the Peace Treaty onfEis^mafSraTandisapttoJeacTtomisunderstanding.The prices to be paid for coaldelivered are: (a.) For overland delivery. The German pit-head price to German^hatidilalsprovided it does not exceed the pit-head price of British coal ibr export.(b.) For sea delivery. The German export prices f.o.b. German ports, or theBritish export prices lo.b. British ports, whichever may be lower.It is not the case that the price which France has to pay for German coal must bethe same as the price paid for British coal.The average price for export coal during October and November may be takento be less than 65s. It is thought that the market is set for this year at an average figure which is somewhat similar, say 65s. France is particularly well-booked for coal ahead, and is obtaining more coal than she received from Britain in pre-wartimes. Some of the higher prices quoted within the last fortnight may be taken as&quot; holiday &quot; prices for &quot; spot&quot; lots, and are no true indication of the settled prices.It is understood that America has already taken off the. restrictions placed on export of coal as a result of the strike, and sooner or later the American; market will again become a corrective to the British market. I strongly recommend that nothingbe done at least until time has been given for the effect of this to be seen.A. C. G.January 6, 1920.
