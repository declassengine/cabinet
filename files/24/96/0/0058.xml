The shortage isoausing great bitterness, and the Transport Workers areinclined to refuse to handle ooal for export.The I&amp;ilwoymen aooepted the Government terms to-day.There is no doubt that the leaders fought strenuously forthe acceptance of the original Government terms, but theywere over-ruled by the rank and file.   It is, however,satisfactory to find that the rank and file are far lesssolid than was the case last September.It is necessary to report that distrust of the Governmentis increasing.   The ooal shortage and the high oost ofliving are doing muoh harm.Reports are given of the Conferences of the ScottishIndependent Labour Party and the Workers1 Committees.There is evidenoe that the Irish publican Brotherhood(the extreme seotion of Sinn Pein) is in direct touoh withthe Soviet Government in Russia through an address in Paris.Appended to this report are accounts of the GermanHousing Bill and the American Soheme for oo-operativesupplies, whioh arc interesting in view of the problems which press for solution in this oountry.
SHORTAGE OF HQTJBEHOXjD COAJj &quot;       &apos;&apos;&apos;. * *The shortage of ooal for household purposesthreatens to overshadow all other questions for the &apos;&quot;moment.   The shortage is, of oourse, being laidat the doorB of the Government.   Messrs. Smillieand Hodges are making the utmost use of it at meetings in.favour of nationalisation, and Mr. Bevin,of the Dockers&apos; and Transport Y/orkers1 Union, speakingat Bristol on January 11th, said that he was goingto ask the Transport Workers to refuse to handleexport ooal.   They did not want money from Prance,Italy or the Argentine to swell the Treasuryaooounts, they wanted their children kept warm.&quot;Let me say to the Government, I hope witha full sense of responsibility, they areheading direct for revolution in this country,First it is the people*s food they play with,then they play with ooal.   Their polioy is agame of shuffling in order to penalise firstthis Bection, and then that, who have the will to try to improve their position.&quot;Continuing Mr. Bevin said that if olass war broke into olass battle, it would be better than this perpetual penury and slave conditions.It is reported that tippers at Cardiff Docksthreaten to strike and so suspend the export ofooal until there is enough for home use.The Goole dockers refused to handle ooal for london, France or Belgium until the looal shortagewas remedied.The miners would seem to have some faith inprinted propaganda, since they are reported to haveissued 10,000,000 leaflets on nationalisation.PROFITEERING AND HIGH PRICESIty correspondents oontinue to report that thecost of living is the ohief oause of unrest intheir/
their distriots.   The reduction in the sugar rationis pro voicing much discontent, but it cannot be said ^that any one article is especially important,   Aslong as nothing can be done towards reducing the priceof food and clothing, the aooeosions to the Labourvoting power will continue, if,, indeed, the resentmentof the working class does not take a more unfavourableturn, for there is a dangerous feeling that the government is itself guilty of profiteering, and isshielding others who indulge in the same practice.It Is significant that a speaker at the NationalConference of Shop Stewards said that the more difficulit became for the working olassee to live, the nearer the possibilities of a revolution oame.   They shouldweloome the inoreased cost of living and hope that itwould go on increasing.THE CO-OPEMIVa) 800IBCTS. AND THE TBfeflB UNIONSThe Co-operative Wholesale Sooiety Committee&apos;sreport for the thirteen weeks which ended on September27th records a turnover of  22,095,887 for that periodThis is an inores.se of  6,03.9,987 or 37&amp;$ on the sales for the corresponding period of last year.   Thesupplies from the Society&apos;s own productive works forthe same period amounted in value to  6,632,557, aninorease of  2,306,964 or 724$v The deposits andwithdrawals in the Co-operative Wholesale Sooiety&apos;sBank for the thirteen weeks amounted to  126,357,321,an inorease of  26,6^1,843.   1,375 trade unions and friendly sooieties, and 879 olubs and other mutualorganisations have accounts with the Co-operative wholesale Society.It is interesting to note that purchases Hoontemplated by the Co-operative Wholesale Societyinclude/
Include the printing works of Messrs. Taylor, Garnett,Evans &amp; Company, Keddish, with land and oottages, price 129,000; Whitehall Cabinet Faotory, Bristol, prioe 27,000; lands and buildings for a clothing faotory atBrislington, Bristol, prioe  16,500; iiope Hall Farm,near Crewe, land for manufacturing developments atIrlam (Manchester) and land for the extension of milk production and distribution at Congleton and ^caster.It is reported that trade between the Co-operative societies in Russia and Sngland has begun,The ourrent issue of &quot;The Railway He view&quot; contains an article urging. Labour to invest in the Co-operative societies; the writer makes the significant suggestionthat savings should be withdrawn from the Post Officeand invested in the Co-operative Societies,The men have been getting up their case for theforthcoming enquiry for weeks, and their organisationarrangements are reported to be excellent.  &quot;unless there is a really efficient organisation on the same lines among the employers, the case may go by default,as in some instances it went during the Coal Enquiry.In Liverpool there is grumbling about the delay,and a.H. Parrah, of the National Union of general works, told my correspondent recently that he doubted whether he would be able to hold his men at Hull.ISy correspondents report week by week a steadygrowth of feeling against the Coalition Governmentand the aocession to the Labour ranks of many peopleof the middle olass, on the ground that things oouldnot be worse under a labour Government.
ANNUAL CONFiliPiSNCfl OF TO- SCOTTISH INDllOTPEINT LABOUH PAKTYSome interesting comments on this oonferenoe, ^whioh passed resolutions as oontradiotory as was itsagenda, mentioned in my report of Deoember 11th, havebeen reoeived.. liy correspondent writes:&quot;It was the largest Congress the IndependentLabour Party has held in Scotland, 210 delegatesbeing present from 110 branches.&quot;Chief among the subjects disoussed was thequestion of the Alliance with the Labour Party.A long and interesting disoussion took place.   the younger element in the party seemed to bedetermined on the withdrawal of the IndependentLabour Party from the Labour Allianoe, chieflyon the ground of the failure, as they alleged, ofthe Parliamentary Party.   The Parliamentary party was roundly denounced as reactionary to the&apos; &quot; -backbone.   The older and more experienced members,however, were strongly in favour of remaining inthe Alliance.   The motion &apos;that this Conferenceoonslders thevtime ripe for the Independent LabourParty to sever its oonneotion with the labourParty as the compromising attitude of the LabourParty is not in the best interests of Socialism&apos;was, on a division, defeated by 147 votes to 53.&quot;Another interesting discussion took plaoeon the question of whether the Independent LabourParty should join the second or third International.The Manifesto issued by the National AdministrativeCounoil, criticising the Soviet system, was loudlydenounoed, and by 158 votes to 28 it was resolvedthat the Independent Labour Party should affiliateto the third International at Mosoow,   This decision,whioh was somewhat unexpected, was received by its (supporters with fiuite a shout of joy.   TheIndependent Labour Party in Sootland is a veryvigorous and lively body but it seems that thereare strong disintegrating influences at work within,the party.   Another question, on whioh there wasacute division,. was on the question of Prohibition.Prohibition was oarried as against nationalisationby 97 votes to 58.&quot;I hear that, especially in the larger jbranches, this controversy is raging fiercely.&quot;There were times when temper threatened thewhole.Conference, and plain speaking and badmanners seemed to be the rule; it was evident fromthe beginning that dictation would only be tolerated from the bottom, and certainjy not fromthe top, ar.d this attitude was fait by the offioialsfrom beginning to end.   Indeed one of the newlyelected offioials dwelt on this phase of theConferenoe before aooepting offioe for the current year.&quot;twice during the day*s proceedings there      *were scenes of great enthusiasm, when the Conferenoevoted so decisively in favour of tho ThirdInternational as against the offioial view 1favouring/   1
favouring the Seoond International,   Then when theSpen Valley result waB announced the &apos;ited Flag&apos;was sung.&quot;A violent speeoh, whioh seemed to be largelysupported, was delivered against Mr, Kamsay Maodonaldro his activities in connection with theseInternationals.&quot;m pay,, w&amp;mnwIt is intended to hold a record oelebrationjnextMay Day.At a recent meeting of the London Joint AdvisoryCourioll of Trade unionists and Co-operators it wasdeoided that the oelebration of May Day, 1920, shouldbe run by a joint oommittee of co-operators, trade unionists and Labour men with a joint secretaryship.It was also deoided to approach tho London JointCommittee and the oo-operative societies with a viewof enlisting their support,    he Albert Hall has been provisionally booked for -tine evening of May Day, whenit is hoped to have a big meeting of the co-operativeand trade union foroes in the Metropolis.On January 11th a. seoond meeting of Trade unionistsand Co-operatives was held at Chandos Hall; a First ofMay Celebration Oommittee has been formed to whioh all workers&apos; associations are asked to affiliate.   As theBritish Socialist Party and the Herald Leaguewere strongly represented, it seems probable that agood doal of hot air will surround the movement.  A     rfurther meeting will be held on February 8th,A DEBATE ON THfi SOVIET SYSTEM Off GOVE^MBNTThe Sootoh extremist Press has devoted considerablespaoe and muoh acid oomment to a debate at Perth onJanuary 5th between the Solicitor General for Scotland -and William Gallaoher.   The debate waB the sequel ofa/
a challenge made to Mr.   Morison by a member of thePerth Independent Labour Party at a Coalition meeting and the result was a vote of 1016 votes to 590 againstGallaoher.   According to &quot;The Worker&quot;   the &quot;landedgently from all quarters of Perthshire,&quot; and &quot;the platform littered with knights, landowners and membersof the Churoh militant&quot; were responsible for this voteIt is, however, clear, even from the prejudiced aoooungiven, that Mr. Morison&apos;s brilliant indiotment ofSovietism nonplussed his opponent and, given debaters, of equal ability, there is little doubt that this formof propaganda would be invaluable.THE LABQfUa EXCHANGESMy, Newcastle correspondent reports that in hisdistrict there is considerable feeling against theLabour Exchanges.   Trade Unionists assert that theyhave failed and are run by an army of incompetentoffioials.   It is considered that the Trade Unionbran ones would make far more efficient Labour exchanges- Similar views have been expressed in other areas andthe UBual contention is that the exchanges fail tojustity the expenditure:whi ch they entai1.CONFEMfCE OP SHOP STEWARDS&apos; AND WjMj&amp;I COMMITTEE!On Januaiy 10th and 11th most of the leaders ofthe Workers1 Committee movement met in Conference atthe International,Sooialist Club, which has replacedthe Communist Club,   Arthur MabManus was in the ohairand there were present, inter alioa:,       J.T.

Administrative Committee  50 &quot;on oondition that theCommittee would ooneider arranging a map for the oomi; J: jKed Army.&quot;   The National Union of Ex-Servioe Men1arepresentative said that, in hoping for the supportof all revolutionary bodies, the Union would supportthe Workers&apos; Committees in whatever they undertook.An interesting light is thrown on the divisions in the International Sooialist movement by the reply of ,the British Sooialist Party to the invitation of theGerman independent Socialists.   The latter, who standbetween the Seoond (Berne) and Third (Moscow)Internationals, intend to hold a oonferenoe with a       Iview to the foundation of a new International.   TheBritish Socialist Party replied:nrShe B.S.P. itself now forms part of the- Third International (as do the diner Left SooialiaUgroups in this oountry, with whom we hope shortly Ito combine in a united Communist Party), and inour opinion those parties or&apos;groups who stillhesitate to join the Third International are either anti-revolutionary&apos;or lack the courage of   1their Sooialist oonviotionsI&quot;The B.S.P., therafore, must deoline to take ,ijpart in your proposed oonferenoe. and takes the    Iliberty of advising you to aot forthwith inacoordanoe with the last clause in yournew progrejamer whioh deolares that you will join the Third International in the event of thefailure of the Conference in whioh you now inviteus to take part,&quot;Tp &quot;HANDS OFF HJ3SIA,r MOVEMENTAs distrust of the Government grows, the workingolasses are inclined to demote more attention to theSoviet form of Government, whioh they regard as thealternative to the Parliamentary system.  The &quot;HandsOff Bussia&quot; Committee is taking full advantage of thisphase and has held meetings in various parts of thecountry at whioh Mr. Goode and Lieutenant-ColonelMalone have been the ohifif speakers.   In order,however/
however, to widen its sphere of aotion, the Committeehas decided that these two men shall in future speakseparately and has arranged meetings at Dundee.Aberdeen, Southport, Southwark, Bristol, Cardiff,Heading, Tunbridge, Bolton, West Ham, Glasgow, BritonPerry, Hathwaite, Bradford, Swansea, Woolwich, ipswioh,manchester, Blackburn, Edinburgh and Abertillery.There can be little doubt that in the presenttime of unemployment and high prices, these men are doing great harm.   Malone*s statement that he brought back from Bussia orders for millions of pounds worth of goods, whioh would employ thousands of workers,has met with general belief, and even moderately&apos; - 1  -.  $f$&amp;f&apos;i?4 Ji^e.to..io&apos;s?-.xs -vyy:\..:,minded wotfeing men speak of the Bolshevik regime witha certainty and admiration whioh are disquieting.W. Paul, the revolutionary draper, and J.T. Murphy,the Shop Steward, have also addressed meetings latelyat Warrington, Bolton and Leigh.   While they made fewnew points, their oontention that, in the event of acapitalist triumph, cheap Bussian labour will be usedto undersell British Trades unionists finds readyacceptance with the suspioiously^minded working classes.Considerable bitterness exists in the Arsenal*   .^ 1.:,&apos; :&quot;&apos;.&quot;t.. &apos;..fi   p,i.iv   wo-**.j.if5v vC   . ,ri-&apos;   ft*&quot;,.vbetween soldiers who are being discharged and &quot;WarHands&quot; whose services are being retained.

On January 11th strongspeeohes were made at a meeting of some 800.men; theywill probably not take action until. they * have seen thePrime Minister.  My correspondent states that the antiTrade Union movement in this district has subsided andthat they no longer sing the National in them as wasformerly done at all  heir meetings.Housing is still the ohief oauee of unrest inSouth Wales.Brighton ex-soldiers threaten to throw themselvejjon the Guardians unless work is found for themimmediately.The extremist National Union of Ex-Servioe Men,whioh is reported to he in financial straits, isappealing for funds.   The Union has formed a &quot;BackPay Committee&quot; and oontemplates a great nationalcampaign next month.On January 7th Mr. 0&apos;Brian stated at a London,meeting of the Irish Self-Determinattoh League thatthe League had obtained the Albert Hall for a massmeeting next month, probably on February 11th.   Hehopes for a good result from this meetinginternationally, believing that any press reportswill be copied abroad.

The number of Irishmen passing through the port who keep in touoh with the chiefmembers, gives the Sinn Fein movement an appearanoeof success quite out of proportion to the aotualposition. &apos; &quot;Manohesteron the other hand, has a fairly goodworking organisation, a clear check on accounts, nohampering religious opposition and a graduallyinoreasing membership.TOM MAM AND THE MiALQAMA!gSD SOCIETY OF ENGIMBSThe activities and speeches of Tom Mann are notmeeting with the unanimous approval of members ofthe/

On January6 th he was sentenced to three months in the SeoondDivision.   From documents found upon him he appearsto have trafficked in revolvers and ammunition withSinn Fein era, with which movement he takes an aoti^part.   In April, 1916,.Carroll married a woman whosefather/
S3father ia a naturalized British subject of Germanorigin, but he appears never to have provided herwith a home.IftHfrANDThere is evidenoe that the Irish HepublioanBrotherhood, the extreme aeotion of Sinn Fein, is indirect touoh with the Soviet Government in fiussiathrough an address in Paris.   It is also in touoh; with the Egyptian extremists, but it has a poor-  opinion of the Indian&apos; extremists and deolines to woxkwith them.There is a steady stream of arms going seoretlyover to Ireland, principally in the form of revolvers.An agent in London has recently purchased sixty Germanrevolvers with that object.There was no improvement to observe in the stateof the Provinoes during the past week and judged bythe number of indiotable offences reported during theperiod the spirit of lawlessness appears inclined to spread,   in County Clare especially, a state of absolute lawlessness prevails, and the Polioe in thiscounty are entirely boyoottod.   wather more than 150offenoes have been reported, of whioh the polioeconsider that about 40 are directly, and a muo^ larger number indirectly, attributable to Sinn Fein,   Thisis as against a total of 90 during the previous week,ulster remains quiet and of the offonoea reported fromthat Province more than half ooourred in the City of belfast, but were only of the nature usually to beexpected in large obmrounitiea.part from this there was no new development in-Sinn Fein aotivlty and the attention of the republicansis at present largely directed to the MunioipalHeotions/
Elections whioh take plaoe during the coning week.In some of the northern toes Sinn Pein and theHibernians have oome to terms as to seats hitherto    &apos;*Nationalist on the councils so as to avoid the risk of losing them to Unionists on a split vote.   Bight SinnPeiners have already been elected unopposed forKoBoommon Town Council and no efforts are being sparedto secure the majority everywhere.Sinn Pein in its Municipal Eleotion Manifestostates that it &quot;puts forward Candidates whose honestyof intent and straightforwardness in aotion isunquestionable and who possess the moral oourageessential to secure the sovereign authority of thenational will of the people as already established,&quot;and that &quot;in Munioipal affairs all Sinn Pein. Candidatesstand for Progress, Purity and Effioienoy ofadministration.&quot;Seoret efforts are being made in some plaoes, thepolice believe, to complete the collection for theIrish icepublican Loan whioh is apparently expected to close oh 1st proximo.   In this oonneotion the hoy andoorn staoks of a farmer who had refused to subscribe to the Loan were malioious3y injured near Westport,Co.

They are said to have been instructedto pey special attention to finding out the best means of spreading pro-Irish republican propagandaamongst tho British soldiers in Ireland.
APPENDIX   IAMERICAN LABOURS EFFORTS TO PEA.L WITH HIGH PRICESAmerican railwaymen have decided to take theirown constructive measures to deal with profiteeringand high prices, believing that increased wages will not affect their position.   They have aocordingly formedan &quot;All American Farmers and labour Co-operativeCommission&quot;, which has as its &quot;basic principle the alliance of the farmers as producers with labourersas organised consumers, and aims at direct dealingbetween the two.   The plan also embraces the establish-ment of a co-operative bank:.Following closely upon the railway-men1s scheme theAmerican Federation of labour announced that it intendedto institute co-operative buying and selling on a large scale, on the basis of the Rochdale system.   TheFederation has sent to every affiliated Union an appeal for funds with which to start the movement, togetherwith a oircular in whioh the following principles ofthe scheme are set forth:1.    Democratic Organisation.2.    One vote for each member, with equality inshare ownership.3.    Cash returns to members of the difference betweenthe amounts they have paid for purchases and thecost of these purchases to the Society afterdeductions for overhead charges and reserve fund.4.

APPENDIX   IITHE HOUSING question in view of the various plans for dealing with housing difficulties in this country, interest attaches to a Bill, drafted to meet a similar situation inGermany, by Dr. Kampffmayer of Karlsruhe.   Tho principlesof the Bill are as follows:The rents&quot;of all houses are to be based on theiramount in July, 1914, and the house-owner will only  ,be allowed to increase the rent in proportion as hisexpenses for keeping the houses in repair, theinterest on mortgagos, tares, etc, have increased.A tax graduated according to the letable value anddegree of luxury obtaining in them will be imposed on all houses, and the sum thus obtained will be spent On rent bonuses for new houses, improving oldhouseo, rent remissions for large families, and onthe gradual transference of the ownership of privatehouses to self-administrative bodies, which&apos;willadminister or become owners, where suitable, of allhouses in the possession of municipalities.   these bodies will have a right of pre-emption in the caseof all dwelling houses at a price based on the valueof the rents now paid for them, and of all settlementland, and a right of expropriation in oases wherethe owner evades the regulations laid down for theprotection Of a tenant, or in which land not yetbuilt over is required for settlement purposes.   Thebest shape which could be given to these bodies wouldbe that of a oo-operative society, half of whose members would be elected from the ranks of house-owners and tenants, while the communes and thebuilding trade should be suitably represented.   the self-administrative bodies in Provinces or FederalState8 should undertake matters beyond the capacityof the district bodies, e*g. the ereojion of a mortgage bank or the provision of building materialby carrying on brick kilns, saw mills, etc.   these bodies would &quot;be able to undertake the repair of buildings neglected during the war with far&quot;greatersuccess than any building control officials, andthey would also be able to effect economies inmanaging and keeping them in repair, which would tend to improve housing conditions.
