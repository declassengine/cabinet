of State for War in his Sunderland speech/15 The Spen Valley election has resulted in an appreciable movement of opinion in the several sections of the Labour movement, whichhas led them as a whole into a position much more favourable to political action, though their positions relative to each other have not changed. As an example, two opinions of contributors to &quot; Forward &quot; may be quoted. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald now thinks itnecessary to point out that the mere winning of Parliamentary seats is not sufficient;there is need, in his opinion, of hard propaganda aimed at the formation of a reliablepublic opinion in support of the Parliamentary Labour Party. The I.L.P., he claims,is the natural organ of such propaganda, and the natural centre of such a constant Labouropinion. Mr. William Stewart has always taken a more extreme attitude than Mr.Macdonald, but whereas before the recent by-elections he was doubtful of the utility ofany Parliamentary or political action, now he is advancing the argument that it may be expedient for the people to capture Parliament by constitutional methods as the easiestway of abolishing it. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; discusses the future of the Labour party on lines similar to its article last week. It attributes recent Labour Party successes tothe broadening of the political basis of the party, in that it has ceased to be purely a trade union party. It points out, however, that this broadening movement has not takenplace to the same extent in the Parliamentary Labour Party, and in order to secure agreater variety of type and diversity of experience among Labour M.P.&apos;s, insists that thecentral office of the Labour Party and the local labour parties must be put on a secureand independent financial basis. The ratification of the Peace Treaty has not caused a renewal of the discussion upon the provisions of the Treaty itself, but has introduced anew element into the articles appearing in the press on this subject. The &quot; Nation &quot;argues that Labour alone is capable of leading the way &quot; from the politics of the Allianceinto the politics of the League.&quot; Mr. H. N. Brailsford, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; putsupon British Labour the task of saving Europe. These statements are of interest in view -Of the opinions of Mr. R. Blatchford and Mr. A. M. Thompson, that it is in Foreign and colonial policy that a Labour Government will be most liable to err. The possible attitudeof the Civil Service towards a Labour Government is discussed in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;the &quot; Nation,&quot; and the &quot; New Statesman.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; Nation &quot;are confident that the bulk of the Civil Service will loyally assist a Labour Government,and Mr. H. N. Brailsford, in the &apos;&apos; Labour Leader,&quot; asserts that &quot; there are in the CivilService, especially in the Foreign Office, many capable experts who are with us.&quot;I.L.P. and the Third (Moscow) International.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald discusses in &quot; Forward &quot; the resolution of the Scottish Divi-sional Conference of the I.L.P. in favour of affiliation with the Third International. Heis disappointed with the resolution and fears, should it be endorsed by the NationalConference of the Party at Easter, that it may bring internal and external troubles uponthe I.L.P. He admits that in Russia, and possibly in Germany, political conditionsdo justify the Bolshevik methods, but in France, Italy, Switzerland and England he adheresto his opinion that the Socialist movement has no cause to desert political action. Inproof of this he states that our Russia demonstrations last July did as much for russians the Italian strikes. The failure of the Second International (and since the decision to postpone the Geneva Conference from February to July,! Mr. Macdonald has been leaningto the opinion that the Berne International is a failure) does not justify to him the prin-ciples and policy of the Third International. &quot; We cannot cheer Spen Valley and adhere to Moscow at the same time,&quot; and Mr. Macdonald prefers to cheer Spen Valley. The sameissue of &quot; Forward,&quot; however, contains interviews with Mr. P. J. Dollan and Mr. J. Maxtonon the subject of this Scottish I.L.P. resolution. Mr. Dollan states that the resolution was only meant to imply sympathy with the Moscow body and that it is too early to saythat the I.L.P. necessarily accepts the policy logically implied by affiliation with the ThirdInternational. &quot; The I.L.P. has not given up the belief in the possibility of obtainingSocialism by peaceful methods.&quot; Mr. Maxton doubts whether the affiliation of the I.L.P.would be accepted by the Moscow body and whether the Labour Party would allow theI.L.P. to take such action. He sees, however, no reason why the I.L.P. should not belongboth to the Third International and to the Labour Party. Such a position, he thinks,would put the I.L.P. in an exceptionally strong position in an endeavour to secure inter-national Socialist unity. Judging from these two interviews it would appear that theScottish resolution may not result in an important change of policy on the part of the I.L.P.but rather in a stormy discussion at the I.L.P. Easter Conference. &apos;y- Saturday, 3rd inst.t Cf. this Eeport, 31st December, pp. 506, 510.
Industrial Situation.The absence of discussion on matters industrial, as opposed to political, is a noteworthyfeature of the current Labour and Socialist press. &quot; Justice &quot; contains a somewhatdespondent and desultory article by a local Ironfounders&apos; secretary, who judges that thereal root of the trouble is a difference between piece-workers and time-workers. Mr. PhilipSnowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; regrets the result of the last ironfounders&apos; ballot, andsuggests that the National Industrial Conference should do something in the matter.He refers to the suggestion, current when his article was written, that a Court of inquiry should be appointed to investigate the conditions of the industry and the profits being-made, but his remark, &quot; This inquiry cannot be held under the Profiteering Act, whichis doomed to expire in May,&quot; shows a strange ignorance of the provisions and working ofthe Industrial Courts Act. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; discusses the terms of theprovisional railway settlement, the details of which it did not know. It claims thatthese terms would barely keep railway wages up to the pre-war standard. The railwaymenare warned that the hope that an early accession to power of a Labour Government mayimprove their wages is quite illusory. The men are directed to strike, if their demands be worth striking for. The references made by this paper to revolution are always the morenervous the nearer revolution is thought to be, and. it is feared rather than hopedthat such a strike might develop into a contest for power between the workers as a whole and the Government. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; is at great pains to explain the terms ofthe provisional agreement. The agreement is defended and the &quot; capitalist press &quot; isblamed for the repudiation of the agreement by so many N.U.R. branches on the 4th and 5th January. The recent developments in the coal situation also receive scant notice inthese papers. The allegations that the shortage of coal in the first ten days of the NewYear has been due to deliberate action on the part of colliery proprietors, are endorsed by Mr. Snowden, and by the &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; and &quot;The Call.&quot; The latter paperconcludes that the &quot; governing class &quot; is playing for a catastrophe, but views the prospectof revolution with more equanimity than the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot;Government Policy.The publication by the &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; of the proposals of the ManchesterBuilding Guild Committee * appeared too late for much notice in the journals reviewedthis week. The only article of note on the housing question is one by Mr. J. C. Wedgwoodin &quot; Forward,&quot; who devotes himself entirely to an advocacy of the taxation of the so-called&quot; unimproved site value &quot; of land. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; deals with the Un-employment Insurance Bill, and urges the workers in the cotton textile industry to take steps for the formulation of a special scheme under the Bill for their industry. &quot; TheGovernment are making an effort to meet the objection to State interference.&quot; The&quot; Railway Review&quot; contains a paragraph depreciating the work of Joint industrial councils. A fallacious agreement is advanced to show that the only real work theseCouncils are doing lies in the sphere of foreign commerce and trade protection, and it iscomplained that the recent issue of the Joint Industrial Council Bulletin does not make public the details of their activities in this direction.Part IV. General Topics.The General Situation.The general situation is more settled than it has been for some weeks. The railwaysettlement has been generally welcomed, though there is a tendency on the part of sectionsof the rank and file to regard it as merely a temporary adjustment, and the stability of thesettlement will be affected if the A.S.L.E. and F. advances fresh wage demands,as Mr. Bromley has suggested&apos; it may. The long-continued moulders&apos; strike has been settled by the acceptance by the men of the terms agreed on at the recent conference.In the case of both the railwaymen and the ironmoulders the rank and file movementof opposition to their accredited leaders has thus, after causing much trouble,been overcome. But in both cases a residuum of discontent and bitterness has been leftwhich may react unfavourably on the prospects of industrial harmony. The miners areprosecuting their campaign for the nationalisation of the mines with renewed vigour, andare making the most of the scarcity of domestic coal and the increased exports of coal at high prices. Strong opposition is being expressed by prominent trade union leaders tothe principle of determining Avages on a sliding scale in accordance with the cost of living.An interesting experiment in Guild Socialism is foreshadowed by the tentative offer of a building Guild Committee in Manchester to erect 2,000 artisans&apos; houses.* All account of these proposals is given in Part IV.fC 3 956) E?
Unemployment.Although unemployment continued to increase the rate of increase is considerably lessthan that previously recorded.During the week ended the 9th January the number of ex-Service men and women on out-of-work donation increased by 10,051, bringing the total up to 393,146. Therewere, in addition, nearly 6,000 ex-Service men drawing donation on short-time policies,over 5,000 of whom were engaged in engineering and ironf ounding. The number of civilianson unemployment insurance steadily increased throughout December, but for the weekended the 9th January there is a decrease of nearly 700, the total now standing at 132,605.The live register for men, which for the period the 19th December to the 2nd Januaryshowed an increase of over 30,000, records a further increase of 5,000 for week ended the9th January. This increase is almost equally distributed between the insured and uninsuredindustries, and is not so marked as hitherto in the industries directly affected by themoulders&apos; strike, but there is a notable increase of nearly 2,000 in building and works of construction. The continued fall in the live register for women has been arrested, andfor the week under review an increase of 2,619 occurs, almost exclusively in the uninsuredndustries and particularly in domestic offices and services.Railwaymen.As stated in last weeks Report, the offer of the Government was accepted by the railwaymen by a narrow majority on the 15th January. The Government did not departfrom the principles involved in the original offer. It adhered to the method of standardisingthe rates of wages on the basis of the average for the grade or group of grades, and main-tained the principle of the sliding scale based on the cost of living. The government undertook to consider any particular case in which individual hardship would result underthe proposed arrangement, and decided to extend the 5s. advance in the war wage to allgrades now receiving the war wage, except the locomotive and clerical staffs and certainothers who are dealt with separately. The Government agreed to extend the principle ofthe proposals to Irish railways for conciliation grades other than drivers, firemen andcleaners. The Government offered to carry out its undertaking with regard to making in-creases retrospective as from last August, although the labour involved in calculating eachcase would be great, and the total payment to the men would be less ; but the railway-men^ delegates decided to accept the lump sum payment of  l for each man employed inDecember in lieu of back payment to August where any back payment was due. On the18th inst. Mr. J. H. Thomas addressed a meeting of the railwaymen at Liverpool. He wassubjected to much interruption, hut declared that the only alternative to the agreement would have been a strike disastrous to the railwaymen and ruinous to the country. Onthe same day Mr. Cramp addressed a Labour Demonstration at Shipley (Yorkshire). he stated that the new railway settlement constituted a remarkable advance, and wouldbe a great advantage in the conducting of negotiations with the railway companies in thefuture. But what had been secured for the railwaymen was not something that would remain for all time. Rumours are current that the A.S.L.E. and F. intends shortly to putforward new demands in view of the increased cost of living. This was foreshadowedby Mr. J. Bromley in his speech a fortnight ago when he stated that his union was onlyawaiting a settlement between the N.U.R. and the Government before making its newclaim. There is stated to be much dissatisfaction in the railway clerical services at thedelay in the classification of different grades of clerical workers.The Nationalisation of the Mines.In virtue of the new life which has been instilled into the campaign for the nationalisa-tion of the mines by the new factors in the situation which were mentioned in last week&apos;sReport, vigorous propaganda has been carried out during the past week. Mr. FrankHodges has been particularly active. He spoke at Southampton on the 14th inst., atNottingham on the 15th inst., and at Leeds on the 18th inst., and the burden of his speecheswas the shortage of domestic coal and the excessive profits being made by the coal owners.He maintained that when the 6s. per ton increase was made in the price of coal, an injusticewas done to British workpeople and British industry such as could not be remedied, and claimed that he had proved beyond the possibility of arithmetical contradiction that theprice of industrial coal should be immediately reduced by 9s. 4d. per ton. This contentionwas explained in a statement which was issued by the Miners&apos; Federation on the 16th inst.Further meetings during the week have been held at Oxford, Coventry, Newport,Glamorgan, York, Barrow, Wakefield and Tunbridge Wells. Mr. Robert Williams, whoaddressed the meeting at Tunbridge Wells, said that the whole trade union movement wasbehind the Miners&apos; Federation and was prepared to take the most drastic steps in with-drawing labour and perhaps in promoting a universal general strike.
The emphasis on wages, which it was mentioned in last week&apos;s Report might beexpected in the campaign, has now become a feature of it. At a meeting of the wages board of the Northumberland Miners&apos; Association on the 13th inst. it was stated that ifthe sliding scale for regulating the wages of miners in Northumberland had been in operationan increase in the wages of hewers would have taken place to the extent of about 8s. pershift, and Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, M.P., in a speech at Coventry stated that South Walesminers could insist on 5s. Qd. to 6s. a day more if they had a fair share of the prices atpresent realised for coal. A recent meeting of the miners in the Rhondda district have called upon the Miners&apos; Federation to make application for a 50 per cent, increase in wagesfailing steps to prevent a further increase in the cost of living.Attempts are now being made to forecast the probable action of the special TradesUnion Congress next month if the Government still refuse to nationalise the mines. the belief is held that a demand for direct action would be strongly supported. In thisconnection it is interesting to note, however, that the annual conference of the GeneralFederation of Colliery Firemen, Examiners&apos; and Deputies&apos; Association, discussed thequestion, and by a large majority declared against direct action. It was decided thattheir delegates to the Trades Union Congress in February would not be granted plenarypowers on the question. It is suggested in some quarters that the Congress might decide,if the Government refuses to go to the country on the question, to take a plebiscite of every person on the Parliamentary voting rolls.Wages and the Cost of Living.A campaign against the principle of the fixing of wages on a sliding scale in accordancewith the cost of living is being engineered by the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; On the 16th inst.this paper maintained that Labour could not allow the principle of fixing wages accordingto the cost of food to go unchallenged, and suggested that to allow this principle to becomepart and parcel of ordinary wage negotiations would be to give the employers a weaponby means of which they could keep down the wages of the workers every time and forall time. The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; has been giving prominence to the opinions of prominenttrade union leaders on this question. It &quot;calls the attention of every section of the british labour Movement to the problem which it states to be as follows : &quot; Should any unionany longer accept agreements under which Wages vary with the cost of living?&quot; Mr.Ernest Bevin has expressed strong opposition to this type of agreement. &quot; I refuse,&quot;he says, &quot; to discuss wages on a fodder basis.&quot; &quot; Under the system of a sliding scaledependent on the cost of living, Labour is asked to recognise, and by recognition tosupport, the theory that in relation to an employer a worker is in the position of a horseto its owner.&quot; Mr. Bevin further stated that what Labour has got to recognise is thatthe present wages paid have no relationship to the measure in which wealth is increased!These wages ought, in fact, to have been operative in pre-war days. No one, he maintains,ought to accept a method of wage payment that involves automatic decrease when thecost of living goes down. &quot;That is asking for sectional strikes and break-aways, andaccusations by the capitalist press of broken agreements, for, whenever the reductionbecomes operative, you may depend that they will be resisted.&quot; Mr. A. Hendersonstrongly supports Mr. Bevin&apos;s views and argues that in some respects the principle of thesliding scale is a method of side tracking the workers, which is more fatal to the social and industrial ideals of Labour than any direct attack by Capital upon the working classmovement. The effect of a sliding scale, he maintains, would be to keep wages always onthe level of bare subsistence. Mr. John Turner, General Secretary of the shop assistants&apos; Union, in an interview with a representative of the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot;stated that the scheme of the sliding scale was directly opposed to the greatfunction of trade unionism. &quot; The progressive improvements in industrial processesare such that the production of wealth tends to become greater and greater every year. Consequently, if the wages of the workers do not steadily increase, their relative position will grow worse and worse.&quot; &quot; If the wages now agreed to canbe paid noAV, they can be paid later on, when production will have improved, andthe same or even higher wages should then be paid, even if the cost of living falls.&quot;Opposition has also been expressed to the sliding scale by other Labour Leaders. there appears to be some suspicion that the cost of living index number published by theMinistry of Labour is &quot;faked,&quot; and in some cases actual charges to this effect have beenmade. There is also a general belief that this figure represents only the cost of food and does not include such items as clothing, rent, &amp;c. This Labour criticism of the sliding scale should be compared with the criticism from the employers&apos; standpoint mentionedin last week&apos;s Report, p. 24.
Manchester Building Guild.An interesting scheme which, if it materialises, will be an important experiment inGuild Socialism, has been suggested in Manchester. A group, known as the BuildingGuild Committee, has sent a tentative offer to the Manchester City Council to build 2,000artisan houses. This Committee has not yet been completely constituted, but it is in-tended to make it representative of all the building trade unions. The scheme has beenheartily endorsed by the District Council of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society, and by a delegate meeting of the Manchester branch of the National Federation of Building TradeOperatives. Mass meetings of the various unions are to be held, in order that the scheme may be fully explained to the rank and file, and their intelligent and enthusiastic supportenlisted. The promoters of the scheme believe that the organised workers in the industry will erect houses more quickly and cheaply if the workers are under democratic control,and if they can establish conditions which exclude the profiteer. They will apply theprinciples of democratic control to the appointment of all the officials engaged in the enterprise from the chief director downwards, and anticipate no difficulty with regard todiscipline. They expect, however, that various practical difficulties will arise. Tradeunions, for instance, are under a disability with regard to engaging in trade, and it istherefore proposed that the Guild should tender through a nominee or should assume thelegal status of a partnership. Further, the Guild Committee will not give any financialguarantee, and maintains that all that it is necessary for it to guarantee is the supplyof labour. It will substitute, in the language of Guild Socialism, group credit, based onthe power to produce, for bank credit. The promoters of this scheme, if it is successful,intend to proceed with the formation of a National Building Guild.Trade Unions and Output.An interesting conference of working-class associations, arranged by the Councilof Ruskin College, was held on the 17th January at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street,to consider questions connected with increased production. Mr. Frank Hodges presided.Mr. J. T. Brownlie, in a paper on &quot; The Workers&apos; Interest in Output,&quot; pointed out thatthe war had emptied the larders and storehouses of the world, and that it was imperative that they should be refilled as rapidly as possible if humanity were to be saved from the mostextreme privations. Referring to restriction of output, he said that if &quot; Ca&apos; Canny &quot;were practised by the workers, it was certainly not unknown among the employers. Whohad not heard of short time in order to make possible the disposal of surplus stocks ?It would be easy to quote numerous cases where supplies had been held back in order thathigher prices might be realised. He drew attention to the lavish expenditure on luxuriesof all kinds since the armistice, and contended that the workers must have some guarantee hat the increased output for which they were asked should consist of the things that were most needed. He maintained that the Government and the employing classes should deal with the unemployment question, in order that every possible worker should beemployed on useful production, and asked, &quot; Why should not the trade unions use their power of bargaining to make stock-Avatering illegal, and to secure the limitation of profits and proper publicity with regard to them ?.&quot; He also voiced a demand that the workers should have a larger share in the control of industry, especially through the medium ofworkers&apos; committees. In the discussion that followed the point chiefly emphasised wasthe necessity for the workers to obtain control of industry, in order that they might ensurethat, if production were increased, it should be production of necessary things. At the afternoon session Mr. H. A. Grimshaw, of the London School of Economics, read a paper on &quot; The Influence of the Distribution of Wealth upon Production,&quot; in which he main-tained that the workers, Avhen asked to increase output, had the right first to ask, &quot; OutputofAvhat?&quot;In general, it may be said that the dominant note of this conference was a confirmation of the attitude which Labour is now adopting toAvards production. The opposition to increased production on the ground that it Avould be followed by unemployment is not now felt so strongly as it Avas six months ago. Labour is beginning to realise that, apartfrom making good the loss and deficiency of the last five years, a permanent raising of thestandard of production is necessary if its legitimate aspirations for greater leisure and improved conditions of work are to be realised. But it is gradually placing greater emphasis on the demand that, if production is increased, Labour must have a measureof control of industry, in order to ensure (a) that the right kind of commodities are produced,,,and (6) that excessive profits from the production of these goods are not obtained by theemployers.
Prices and Profiteering.During the week much attention has been paid to the statement of Mr. William*.Mackinder, wool top and noil warehouseman, Bradford, at a meeting of the CentralProfiteering Committee in London on the 16th inst., that the Investigation of PricesCommittee had taken six standard counts of yarn, and that the margin of profit betweenthe War Office profit allowed on the production of that yarn and the profit made nowwas from 400 per cent, to 3,200 per cent. This allegation by Mr. Mackinder, who is LabourCandidate in the Manningham Ward for the Bradford City Council, appears to have met with much credence, and it would seem desirable that an authoritative statement on the matter should be issued as early as possible. The Committee on Trusts appointed by the CentralProfiteering Committee, at a meeting on the 20th January, repeated its demand for thepublication of the reports it has drawn up and submitted to the President of the Boardof Trade, and the Labour members of the Committee even threatened to suspend workunless the reports were made public. Such allegations as those of Mr. Mackinder are accepted with avidity by a certain section of Labour and are, without examination, adducedas instances of the rapacity of the employer.Industrial Courts Act.The Court of Inquiry under this Act into the claim by the National Transport Workers&apos;Federation for a standard minimum wage of 16s. per day for dockers and waterside workers and into the conditions of the employment of dock and waterside workers in Great britain is as follows : -The Right Hon. Lord Shaw of Dun-     A. Pugh, Esq.ferinline (Chairman). Frederick Scrutton, Esq.Sir Joseph G. Broodbank. John Smethurst, Esq.Sir Lionel Fletcher. , Ben Tillett, Esq., M.P.Harry Gosling, Esq., C.H. Robert Williams, Esq.Secretaries-Mr. Norman Macpherson (late Secretary to the special arbitration tribunal under the Munitions of War Act); Mr. G. H. Ince (Ministry of Labour).The Court held a preliminary meeting in private on the 22nd January, and the hearing of evidence will probably begin in the first week of February.Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill.At the meeting held on the 11th January at Cardiff under the auspices of the Seafarers&apos;Joint Council Mr. Havelock Wilson stated in the course of his demand for the inclusion of sea-farers within the scope of the Hours of Employment Bill, that when a ship arrived in portthe men could have the time off which they had worked at sea ; if it was not possible to givethe time off, the men could be compensated in the way of overtime. On the 16th inst.a meeting was held at Hull which passed a resolution in favour of the inclusion of officersand men of the merchant service in this Bill.With regard to Agriculture, at a meeting of the Northallerton and District AgriculturalClub on the 14th inst. Colonel M. J. Wilson, M.P., Secretary of the Agricultural Committeeof the House of Commons, stated that the Committee proposed to try to get this Billre-drafted so as to secure the recognition of the need for overtime so far as agricultural workers were concerned, and the right of farmers individually or collectively to make their own bargains with the men and to provide for proper machinery for the working of overtime.Registration of Dockers.Consequent upon the recommendation of a Committee appointed by the Ministryof Labour, a Committee has been constituted under the name of the Port of LondonRegistration Committee to formulate and carry into effect a scheme of registration fordock workers in the Port of London. This Committee will commence its work immediately,under the chairmanship of Sir John Wimble.Overtime.Much discussion has taken place recently with regard to overtime in the wool combingbranch of the woollen textile industry. The Wool Combing Employers&apos; Federation havesuggested a ballot of the operatives on the suggestion that systematic overtime shouldcontinue for a period of four weeks, before the lapse of which it is hoped that a bonuson production scheme, which is now under consideration, will be completed and ready
for adoption. The executive committees of the Unions concerned have replied thatthey cannot entertain any application for a continuance of systematic overtime until thewhole of the operatives at present unemployed are absorbed in the industry. It is reportedthat one result of this attitude of the trade unions has been that many unemployed havebeen given work.Income Tax.At the annual conference of the General Federation of Colliery Firemen, Examiners&apos;and Deputies&apos; Associations at Cardiff on the 15th January, it was decided to support the-movement for the raising of the Income Tax exemption level to  250. The general labour movement, however, in this direction is at present in abeyance.Payment for Holidays.In the cotton trade, the employees have made an application for payment for holidays..This matter was recently discussed at a joint meeting of the Federation of Master CottonSpinners&apos; Associations, the Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association and theUnited Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association. The Employers refused the demand,but it will in all probability be put forward again in the immediate future.The &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;The &quot; Daily Herald&quot; continues to report trade union financial support for its development fund. A vigorous criticism of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; appears in the currentissue of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot; The latter paper maintains that the &quot; daily herald &quot; has no policy except that amid all its curious contradictions and vacillations,it is at present attempting to secure a coalition of bourgeois and trade union elementsto form a so-called moderate Labour Government. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;attacks the &quot; Herald &quot; for publishing advertisements hostile to Labour and maintainsthat it is not the business of a Labour newspaper to give space to the capitalists to put their case. &quot; Every time the &apos; Herald&apos; accepts payments for putting such advertisements,in its columns it is accepting a bribe.&apos;&apos;Part V.-Departmental and District Reports.(1) Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.Appointments. During the week ending the 9th January, 1,268 candidates wereavailable for appointments. The number of candidates known to have been placed duringthe week was 481, making a total to the 9th January of 20,417.Training Grants Scheme. The Grants Committee have received from the DistrictSelective Committee 14,887 applications for training, of which 11,419 have so far been sanctioned.Employment Department.Unemployment. On the 9th January, 508,879 men and 49,482 women were on thelive register. Vacancies remained available for 25,942 men and 45,946 women. Thenumber of juveniles on the live register was 28,139, and the number of juvenile vacancieswas 15,148.Training Department.Interrupted Apprenticeship Schemc-JJ-p to the 14th January agreements had been,received in respect of 25,456 apprentices from 9,089 employers. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 23,753 apprentices.Wages and Arbitration Department. (Training of Disabled Men. The Minister has decided that before future schemes forthe special trades, prepared by the National Trade Advisory Committees, are agreed toby the Ministry, they shall be submitted to the Wages and Arbitration Department fortheir opinion whether the learners&apos; wages proposed may be regarded as adequate.
The Industrial Court. The awards made during the week by the Industrial Court-include a national award granting to gas workers advances varying for different under-takings, according to their yearly production of gas.The 12  per cent. Bonus. A semi-official inquiry has been received from the treasury as to whether the 12^ per cent, bonus might now be regarded as a cost-of-living advance.A reply has been sent to the effect that the bonus has now lost its original character, and could probably be treated as a general advance of the same character as other general war advances.Industrial Councils Division.Baking (Scottish). At a meeting of the Council on the 13th January, the questionof female labour was discussed. A report recommending a return to pre-war conditionsreceived the support of both sides as lending itself to satisfactory local adjustment.Electricity Supply. At a meeting on the 16th January constitutions were approved for six district councils.Conference of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial ReconstructionCommittees. A conference of these bodies convened by the Pottery Joint IndustrialCouncil met on the 15th January. A resolution was carried expressing strongly the opinionthat legislation should at once be introduced, giving power to the Ministry to make binding on the whole of an industry any wages awards or agreements or arrangements for working hours and conditions made by Joint Industrial Councils.
