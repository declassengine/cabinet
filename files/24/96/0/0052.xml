j.......G, P E T,P.-452.0 A B.I H g T.AGREMMI WITH THE APHJ3BY IRON CO,Memorandum by ,then Acting Secretary, Cabinet.A Prime Minister^ Conference had under consideration onKovember 25th, 1919, a memorandum by the Minister of Munitions,Paper CP. 136, regarding the agreement which was entered intowith the Appleby Iron Oo., in September 1917.     The Ministerof Munitions in the memorandum referred to proposed that theGovernment should  agree to a settlement with the Appleby IronCo., in order definitely to limit the liability of theMinistry of Munitions rather than that the scheme for theextension of the proposed works should proceed under theoriginal agreement.    Under the settlement proposed by theMinistry of Munitions the sum of  2,539,337. 10. 0. would bepaid to the Company, made up as follov/s :- . 3.   d55$ of the approved cost of the proposedworks. (See CP.136 page III and appendix A paragraph 5 of letter fromthe Ministry of Munitions of September1st and letter from the Ministry ofMunitions of September 21st).  ,175,280.   0.   0An additional claim by the Companyunder paragraph 3 of the letter fromthe Ministry of Munitions ofSeptember 21st viz: one-half of theremaining 45$ in respect only of theincrease in cost due to wages awardsand additional interest.(The Company originally claimed thefull 45$). 364,057. 10,   0 2.539.357. 10.   0The Conference decidedThat the Law Officers should be asked to considerafresh the whole question of the contract with theAppleby Iron Co., and to advise whether, in theiropinion, it was so drawn that nothing short of theterms proposed by the Minister of Munitions waspossible.     In particular the law Officers shouldbe invited to consider whether the Minister ofMunitions was bound to award anjrtiring under theterms of paragraph 3 of the letter of September 21st,1917,from the Ministry of Munitions to the Appleby Iron Co.,if he thought that the Company was otherwisesuf f ici en tly rewarded or compensated .
The following opinion has now &quot;been obtained fr^m the Lawofficers of the crown&quot;We have carefully considered these papers and have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in the factstas placed &quot;before us to afford- a legal justification fora repudiation of the contract oy the Crown.If it oould be shown that by reason of any delay onthe part of the Company/ fst which the Company was responsible, the completion Of the scheme had been 93unreasonably prolonged as in effect to destroy the enter-prise it is possible that different considerations might arise.   We notice that it is now contemplated that so-far from &quot;being completed as was anticipated originally in about two years from the date of the contract thebuildings cannot be completed until late in 1921.   Suchan extension of the date for completion would in ouropinion if it could ,not be justified by the Company give some ground for contending that the scheme had proved^abortive but so far as we can gather frgra the documeritsno blame is imputed to the Company for this delay whiohwould seem to have teen occasioned by alterations and additions to the original scheme.   It might be worthwhile in view of the magnitude of the sum involved to havethe case considered by the Technical advisers of theDepartment from this point bf view unless those gentlemenalready know enough about it to say that there is in factnothing to be made of the point...We would add for the sake of clearness that we donet by our opinion of the 23rd October last intend to lay it down as a matter of law that the Company must bepaid some sum in addition to the 55^ unless the Ministercf Munitions is of opinion that some sum must be allowed in order to make the 55$ an adequate allowance..i(Signed)   GORDON HOTART.&quot; ERNEST M. POLLOCK.G.A.H. BRANSONIt remains to add that should the Cabinet decide notto authorise the settlement proposed by the Ministry ofMunitions it will be ppen to the Appleby Iron Company to insist that the scheme should proceed under the criginal agreement.It is stated on page III cf the Memorandum by the Minister ofMunitions (CP.136) that the figures on which the proposed settlement is based are those of January 1919, and that it isanticipated that in view of the rise in wages and cost ofmaterials since that date, should the original scheme beallowed to proceed the liability ef the Ministry of Munitionswould be considerably increased.(Sgd.)   THOMAS JOSTJiS,Acting Secretary.Whitehall G&amp;rtiens , 3.17./l15th January, 1920.
