Confidential,   &apos;.13th January 1920.-Political; Intelligence.Department,Poreign Office.Spain./Oil.onThe Grave Situation in Spain,.imiiiii i ii ww ii iin f i- mi r i &quot;mm wi i  m pw *i wiwia pi i-m moMttpmiflniThe condition of Spanish affairs has become profoundly O.M-plioatvd and anxious.    Tr/o grave dangers, which for a&apos;considerabIdtime past have obviously threatened the security cf existing insti-tutions and the general peace, havs? become conspicuously accentuated.Or.!, tiie one hand there has boon a marked development of. the activitiesof the irregular military organisations,known as the Juntas, fol-lewod by demonstrations in a debate in the Chamber,, of the absenceof nerve in facing them on the part of those politicians who do notsympathise with them^ as Senor la Cierva frankly does. .   On theother hand there has been and there-continues a very serious develop-ment at Barcelona and also to a considerable extent in Madrid; ofindustrial disputes on a larije scale\ and there appears to be avery distinct connection between those latter developments andthose of the activities of the JuntasiThe.Juntas are combinations of regimental officers, chiefly ifnot entirely, belonging to the Infantry, formed as it. would appearoriginally to a largo extent for professional purposes for whichmuch could be said, Ocg. improvement of pay and reform in that organisation of the Spanish Army which corresponds to our StaffCollege,     That ^organisation, known as the War School,, is&apos;not atall an up-to-date institution - on the contrary it is said to bedistinctly behind the.times, - so that when members of it are senton
on.active service they are-;feuxtfl to he out of. touch with the offi-core who may ho serving with or&apos; under&apos; thorn, &quot;and-wanting in tow-ledge as to modern, military theory and practice     Such a state ofthings is of course, in a high degree unfavourable to tho efficiency of the Army and it is difficult to say that offloors who recognise the evils thus involved are to blame for taking collective action with a view to removing those avilo so Ions? as such action is con-fined within due limits of militaryu subordination.     The proceedingsof the Juntas however are far from having been limited to pro-fessional questions such as the reconotitution and reform of theStaff College, or to the pursuit of those aims by moans which could.,by any stretch of interpretation, bo regarded as professionallylegitimate.     That such-objections to their proceedings are well-founded has been shown by a collective document of withdrawal fromthe Juntas, published in some of the Spanish newspapers, and signed by .25 ex-students of the Staff College:-, and still more decisivelyby the vindictive and highly irregular measure taken by tho Juntasagainst the signatories of that document, which was in fact thecause of the fall of - tho Cabinet of Scnor Sanchez de Toca.     Themoaoivr&apos;. in question consisted of the formation of a so-oailed Courtof Honour before which the signatories of the document&apos;referred towere summoned, and by which those offsers wore condemned to bo ox-pelled from tho Army.    The incriminated officers appealed to theSupreme Council of War and Marine against this sentence, and itwas set aside by that Tribunal,     The iiinistcr of War;, General Tcva,in the Cabinet of Senor Sanchez de Toca, naturally uphold the doci-sion of the Supreme Council of War and Marine, whereupon the Juntas. issued what was called an ultimatum to him, with the result that,,% apparently
apparnotly after ,roor*vtnan inclining to yield to the grossly irne-gular pressure thus brought&apos; to boar upon him, ho resigned and was followed into retirement by the Premier and the rest of tho Cabinet.Before this happened, however, an important debate took placein. the Chamber on a motion submitted by the Republican Boputy, SonoiDomingo, demanding that &quot;the Chamber should declare tho Juntas tobe constitutionally illegal.&quot;    The debate, as has been already ,indicatod, illustrated a very ftogrottable timidity on tho part of thopolitical.leaders in tho expression of any opinion hostile to thoJuntas. .  They wore actually dofendeu by tho Maurists, led by Senorla Ciorva (for Son or Maura&apos;-, since his retirement from tho premier--ship after the general election last oummor, has hold aloof from,the Chamber).     But son or la Cierva&apos;s vindication of the Juntasamounted, in fact, from the constitutional point of view, to a verydecided condemnation of them.     For ho contended that when ho wasMinister of War &quot;the Juntas had dissolved as political parties, but had remained only as. professional associations.&quot;-    Ec proceeded to contend that whether they were or were not declared to bo a danger to tho State, &quot;the revival of tho causes which brought them intob ing v^oulti produce their own revival&quot; and that &quot;to declare themillegal woul&apos;.! be to invite disastrous consequences.&quot;     Tho Premier,Scnor Sanahcz do Toca, took a singularly weak lino. .  lie doclinodto express his own opinion on Scnor Domingo&apos;s motion,, but said thathe should vote against it after the Chamber had expressed its views,which, ho hold, was tho object of tho debate.     Ho maintained thatthere wore in existence Jumtas which confined their action withinperfectly legal limits and affirmed that during his&quot;term of officehio Government had enjoyed the full exercise of it3 rights without interference from tho Juntas-     Any weight which oould have boonattached
looattached to this qualified defense of the Juntas by Senor Sanchezdo Toca has boon more than ncu.tra3.ised by his own subsequent resigna-tion under circumstances already referred to.Equal, if not rnoro  significant evidence of tho real characterof tho action of tho Juntas, -vas afforded in the aamo debate by the speech of Count Romanones who, aa will bo remembered, was the holderof the premiership from December 1918 to the middle of April last. .Count Romanon00 said that he had been blamod for permitting thoexpulsion from Barcelona during a great strike of tho Civil governor and the Chief of Police, which expulsion, as will be recalled,, wasnotoriously duo to the pressure exorcised by the Juntas.     But tohave done otherwise, Count Romanonea said, &quot;would have boon to (Sitailserious consequences for things which they all respected&quot; - an ob-sor&amp;p-tion which nuct reasonably be taken to have referred to the stability of the constitutional monarchy.     Count Romanones went onto ropoat the declaration which he had made at the time of his resignation, namely, that ho would never again take office so longas the Juntas continued to exist.     He maintained however, that parliament could not be called upon to pronounce the dissolution ofthe Juntas which, he said, was the function of tho Minister of War,and he therefore would vote against the resolution.     That resolution was in the end rejected by 72 votes to 1.1,, but. it is impossible toreal tho report of the Debate without feeling that the real propon-deranco of opinion was quite otherwise than is represented by thosefigures, and that if everyone had voted as he thought and felt,there would have been a combination of votes against the Juntas fromthe moderate C on s-rvs,tivo&apos;s under Sen or s Dato and Sanchez do Toca,from Monarchical Liberals of various shades under Count Romanonesand others, and from. Republicans, which would have thrown Son or laCierva
Cierva and the Maurists with a handful of the Extreme Right as sup-porters cf the Juntas^ into a clistinot, if not smalti minority.As things aro3 the Juntas must ho recognised as having gained a vic-tory.    Thus, as maintained in the Memorandum on the Situation in spain, of June 3rd, 1919, the Army is still seen to ho the mostimpvEfcant of the dominant powers in the country.    The only considera-ticn whicM can be advanced in mitigation of the extremely serioussignificance of that state of things is the fact than the Army is notunited,, as has been shown by the incident of the expelled officers,who had pasoed through the Staff College, whoso action even if, initself irregular - has issued in the present situation.It is however difficult to over-rate the risks to any State fromthe existence of a military organisobion which by its very essenceis destitute of responsible leadership but which has tasted the joysof practically supreme power over flic chief governing elements in theconstitution of the country concerned.     To a State in the condition of spain the risks so involved must be of a specially serious character.What could have been expected in England, supposing that a casualcombination of irresponsible Army Committocs had boon in the positionto bring pressure to bear effectively upon the Government and parliament on the one side or on the employers on the other, any time during thepast 100 yoars,, with a view to the drafting of legislation dealing withfactories and mines, or to the beginning and ending of strikes and lock-outs.     Our industrial problems have been and are difficult enough,as we have lately soon, without any such aggravation, notwithstandingall the training we have had, civilians and soldiers alike, in the considered and orderly treatment of such mattors.     There is no suchft ,ien.g tradition in Spain:   there, the Juntas, in touch with high Toriesliko
like son or la Cicrva, interfered irresistibly as has just been soonin tho spring of 1919, vitii tho administration of a Government like that of Count Romanones in regard to tho treatment of industrialconflicts in Barcelona.     And within tho last for/ weeks it is corn-monly beliovod that son or la Cierva has encouraged, if not actuallyinstigated, the enforcement by the employers of a general lockoutat tho same storm centre and(now in tho capital itoolf.     As this iswritten, there arc no reports of any improvement in the industrial situation thus created, and even if a lull should soon como about,tho future outlook cannot but bo gravely darkened by the bittermemories of the hardships caused by the stoppage of work in mostindustries, for several winter weeks.     The ground will thus havebeen only too well prepared for the sowing of the seeds of classhatred which are liberally provided, as is believed, by money fromabroad.     And when such crops boar fruit, as they are likely to do all too quickly, in revived conflicts, tho Juntas, wo may be prettysure,, will bo ready to back Senor la Ciorva again in encouragingtho employe.ro to plunge once more into wholesale industrial war.There seems to be little likelihood that the &amp;ew Coalition-Ministry under Senor Allendesalazar, himself apparently a ModerateConservative, will prove to have tho backbone necessary to onablothorn to deal formly with the Juntas and thus rebuild the foundation of a really constitutional government.It is impossible to avoid noticing the added danger, which has begun to show itself, of an&apos;extension of agitation among tho pcaoarrry of Andalusia. B1or some time past, the well recognised symptomsof a disposition towards revolutionary mpvemonts have peon observed
I in that great agricultural province.     In many directions thereN. ,iave heen incendiary fires on the estates of nobles who seldomirisit their provincial territories&apos;and live in luxury in palacesIn Ladrid.     It is to be feared that in too many cases a sense of. responsibility towards the peasantry on their great domains has notliescended to the grandees of Spain with their ancienjj and picturesqueJlineage.    probably in that respect, like landlords in other coun-trioo, they vary very considerably, but it is always the wealthyand inconsiderate proprietor whose conduct is treated as:typical byagitators and. from whoso neglect, or worse, tho kindly and consider-ate members, of tho class suffer not less really than the tenants ofthe heartless ownoro of neighbouring estates.    Andalusia may wellpresent before long a counter-part to the Irish land problem, whichit has -taken the British Parliament more, than a generation&apos; to solve,and we may bo quite sure that no good solution will be helped in Spaiiby Sen or la Cierva and the Juntas.
