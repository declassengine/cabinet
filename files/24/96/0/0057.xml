This    current is the Property of      aH&apos;.3      -,r..v.; MatesYo Government. . //f j) &apos;^^M jj, j &apos;C A B I N E T. &apos; r     vFOOD MINISTRY ESTIMATES 1920 - SI. 174MEMORANDUM by the Food ControllerCONFIDENTIAL,3(1)   I have stated In Parliament that the rationing of sugar andof butter would probably be necessary so long as these commodities were In short supply.   This expression of opinionrequires early ratification by the Cabinet in view of thenormal Treasury requirement that I should submit estimates tobe included In the Vote of Credit for the coming financial year*(2)   I do not imagine that there will be any difference ofopinion as to the necessity for the continuance of the rationing of sugar to individuals.   It will be remembered that in the early part of 1917 the Commission on Industrial Unrest laid specialemphasis on the necessity for equal distribution of sugar*   this need was ultimately met by the development of a scheme of local ,organisation comprising Food Commissioners who exert a generalauthority in their prescribed areas, while the enforcement orOrders and the organised distribution of foodstuffs is supervisedby Executive Officers of Local Food Committees,(5)    &quot;While it may fairly be claimed that the absence of anyserious trouble in respect of foodstuffs during the war was dueto the successful working of this form of local organisation(which was, moreover, responsible for the successful feeding ofthe people during the recent strike) it is in my opinion notpossible to justify Its continuance in its present form, havingregard to the substantial cost which is involved, and the improved position of food supplies in all hut a few commodities..One object of the formation of Local. Food Committees was to stimulate local Interest.   This purpose appears to have beenserved, as In the larger areas the Committees seldom meet anda        the work devolves on the Executive Officers.   I,, therefore, do not propose to renew the Local Food Committees after the 30th June,when their statutory existence terminates, and T am preparing a
substantially more economical scheme for continuing such parts oftheir work as must necessarily remain, in which I shall no doubt have the assistance of the Minister of Health.   Whether the fullnumber of Divisional Pood Commissioners should be retained, or their number reduced and their powers spread over wider areasdepends on the degree of preparation which is thought desirable for meeting emergencies such as strikes, and the settlement ofthis question can be deferred.(4)     As sugar is to be rationed, I am of opinion that butter,should be rationed too.   It is, I think, impossible to maintain that butter is a luxury, and the fact that the removal of themaximum price on home-produced butter will enable people withmeans to obtain a considerable supply renders it, to my mind, themore necessary to.maintain and distribute equitably the scantybut regular supply of Government Imported butter, to which the poorer classes have become- accustomed during the war, and towhich they ascribe enormous importance.(5)     If butter is to be rationed by the Government it must be purchased by the Government, and I feel bound to dissent fromthe limitations which have been set to my trading in thiscommodity.   Nothing has impaired the prestige of the Ministry of food in the eyes of the. public more than the recent refusals ofthe --Treasury to sanction the ourchase of substantial suppliesv. &quot;**    ravailable in the United States, the Argentine and Holland.   Withthese supplies the butter.ration could have been maintained at-ozs. per head per week.   Without them the ration has had to bereduced to 1-oz (as compared with a pre-war consumption of 4 to5-oss.) and I see no possibility of raising it above the present level unless I.have access to these forbidden sources of supply.Further, in the case of the Argentine Butter, the proposedpurchase price was low, and the profits made on this purchasewould have enabled me to avoid, or at any rate postpone, a risein the retail price of Government butter, which I must nowshortly announce. *
I fully recognised the difficulty of the exchange in thecase of these three ,sources of supply, and if all imports ofluxuries from countries in which the exchange is adverse wereprohibited 1 could recognise the financial logio of such adecision.   But to single out and subject butter to this embargoappears to me to be entirely indefensible, especially havingregard to medical opinion on the value of butter fat as a. food,and to the already stringent shortage of supply,.&apos; &apos; In one country where there is no question of exchange and where price is low. the question of the Ministry&apos;?, futurepurchasing policy is urgent.   The Australian and New zealand government are pressing for an immediate decision on the questionof the purchase of. their exportable butter surplus for the season1920 - 21.- Their butter is the cheapest in the world, and it is,in my opinion, plainly desirable that we should buy it, and, -further, that we should generally be at liberty to buy butterwherever we can withoi.it asking Treasury sanction to everyindividual purchase, subject only to the condition that we incurno loss upon the r,e**sale.(6) Cheese and Butter go more or less together, and. so longas we continue to buy butter we should, i think, continue to buyimported cheese *   The refusal of the Treasury to sanction thepurchase of Canadian Cheese at 25 cents during the summer of1919 caused us to acquiesce in private purchases of that commoditwith the result that the price was raised to 29 or 30 cents*- asum of about  600,000. (the difference between purchase at 23 andat 29 cents) thus went unnecessarily into the pockets of theCanadian producers at the expense of this country, and of course the effect on the Exchange was worse than if the Ministry hadbeen allowed -to purchase at the lower figure, because the bulfc &apos;of the cheese in any case came to this country..   Only when we obtained an overdue and reluctant consent was the price againbrought down to 25 cents.   Under the system of Government pur--chase and distribution we have provided a fair quantity of cheese
17.of good quality at the lowest price ruling in any Europeancountry.(7)   The advantages of centralised buying in the United states have further been demonstrated in the case of bacon.     Twelvemonths ago there was a general demand for decontrol and an assur-ance that if control were released and private enterpriseencouraged., prices would fall.     So far as bacon is concerned,precisely the opposite happened.   Prices rose and the qualitydeteriorated.     I was forced to resume control in August, and itis only now, after disposing of the inferior bacon imported by theTrade., that I am able to provide the public with a decent quality of bacon at a reduced price.     I have always proposed to continuebacon purchases, unless&quot;and until the trade can be induced to substitute centralised buying for sporadic competition, which,under present conditions, appears to mean worse quality and higher prices *     And this Intention has been fortified by a cablefrom New York indicating that packers are storing green bacon inthe hope of making higher prices in May when control is expectedto be removed j, and asking for an assurance that even if a nev/scheme is adopted, centralised buying may be continued8(8)   The detriment to the consumer which may be caused by the- &quot;&apos;.. -..abandonment of Government buying may be illustrated by an instancenearer homo.   In October, 1918, I asked the Treasury to sanction the purchase of the exportable surplus of Irish potatoes at aprice of  6.10s. a ton.     In deference to their representations Iadopted an alternative scheme of regulating private shipments, butthe result of this has been an increase in the price to the pro-ducers and a corresponding loss to the consumers in this- country.(9)   It will be necessary to maintain existing controls in thecase of wheat so long as the bread subsidy continues, In thecase of sugar so long as world supplies are short, and in the
case of imported bacon/ butter and cheese so.long as purchasesare effected by the Governments     It Is further desirable toretain maximum wholesale and retail prices of imported meat solong as the Government hold stocks of this commoditye   Other-wise, I propose to remove all existing controls at suitablepoints between the 31st March and the 30th June, and to substitutearrangements with the trade such as have proved successful In thecase of oils and fats.     I adhere to the view expressed at theend of my memorandum C*P.146 of the 18th November, 1919, as tothe necessity for the continuance of some degree of food super-vision for two or three years? and I shall submit alternative proposals on this point after Eastern    By that time the pro-gressive substitution of arrangements with the trade for control&apos;by statutory Order will have enabled me to effect considerable reduction of stall, and In this connection I would emphasizethe fact that the Ministry of Pood has hitherto cost the tax-payer nothing9(10)   I ask the Cabinet:-(i) to approve the continuance of a national scheme of rationing of sugar and Imported butter on a lesscostly basis than the present scheme;(li)   that, until further notice I may have liberty to tradeIn butterj cheese and bacon, subject only to therestriction that no loss to the Exchequer is involved&apos; &apos; GEO. H. ROBERTS *MINISTRY OF FOOD,15th January, 1920.
