CONFIDENTIALiiment is the Prooj^nj,From Viceroy, SObh December 1919.(Received 2 p.m., 5tli January 1920.)1777 S. Secret. Following from Kashgar, dated 15 th December, received27th December :-&quot;I have received reports from Ferghana as follows: 10th. December. mission of 16 Afghans arrived at Marghilan end of November from Oabul to interviewMahomed Emin Beg regarding pan-Islamic Confederacy which it is proposed to formamong Moslem peoples and States in Middle and Central Asia. Deputation broughttwo gold swords for presentation to Mahomed Emin Beg and Shermat, his cavalrycommander. A deputation has been sent by latter to Cabul this autumn with lettersigned by about 100 influential men in Ferghana soliciting Afghan aid againstBolsheviks. Letter contains undertaking to swear allegiance to anyone who would help them. Deputation was also sent to Constantinople with this view. Result ofthis deputation is being ascertained by me.&quot;All my agents report that Afghanistan wishes active intervention in RussianTurkestan, has hopes of expansion there and seems to be determined to eliminateBritish influence and to foster pan-Islamic movement. Mission from Cabul told.Mahomed Emin Beg that Bokhara had been occupied by Afghan troops and. that itwas futile to expect help from British, as Afghans had defeated them, they had suedfor peace and that British had been compelled to relinquish control over Afghanforeign relations, whilst they had also been forced to withdraw&quot; from Askabad andTranscaspia and would soon be evicted from Persia.&quot; Russian Turkestan Mahometans are adversely impressed at the British(? withdrawal) from Transcaspia when Bolsheviks were weak and isolated inTurkestan, and now that Bolsheviks have gained in strength and power, Afghanadvances and intrigues, as well as pan-Islamic movement, are appealing to thepeople.&quot;
