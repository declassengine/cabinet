OP PERSONNEL IN THE ROYAL AIR FORCE INRELATION TO ITS PRESENT LIABILITIES AS REGARDSDISPOSAL OP SURPLUS MATERIAL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air,The Royal Air Force ia faced with a serious shortage of personnel to meet the liabilities at presentresting on it in connection with the disposal of surplusstations and material.The curtailment of the current estimates and thenecessity for accelerating the progress of demobilisationhave entailed rapid and drastic reductions of personnel,which now consists almost entirely of men engaged on ordinary enlistments, all of whom are urgently&quot;requiredfor the purposes of the after the war Air Force as such.As a consequence, it is impracticable to provideany longer the large numbers required for the custody,storage&quot;and handling of surplus stores, responsibility forwhich functions at present rests with the service department notifying under the Far Cabinet*s decision ofthe 18th June, 1919.Trie labour involved is very considerable.The listing of the surplus stores in itselfoccupies a large strength of personnel, and is of necessitya protracted operation which is productive of lengthydelays in tho notification for disposal of stationssurplus to Royal Air Force requirements.The oustody and handling of these storesconstitute a still greater drain on Royal Air Forceresources, sinco parties are required to guard the stations and their contents for considerable periods afternotification, whilst in some cases it has even been necessary to draft extra personnel back to evacuatedstations, in order to pack stores and put them cn railafter a aale has been effected by the Disposal Board,-As a result of the difficulties above indicated,the Royal Air Force Is still in occupation of no less than106 stations in the ^nltod Kingdom which are not includedin the after-the-war programme for permanent retention,whereas personnel is only available for manning approximate-ly one third of this number.At these stations (many of which have already beennotified for disposal, whilst the work of listing the stores and their preparation for disposal is proceeding atthe remainder) nearly 700 officers and over 6000 other ranks are employed on duties which from the standpoint ofthe Royal Air Force are wholly unproductive.Further, 76 officers and 706 Other Ranks are stillengaged in clearing up evacuated stations in Fnm/je, whilst,the Army rn the Rhine absorbs another 71 officers ana&apos;   -804 Other Ranks.
In addition, a considerable strength both ofofficers and men is employed with the German Mission,although a certain number of the officers has been drawn from personnel otherwise eligible for demobilisation,who have been specially retained in view of the emergency.The above figures take no account of other commitments, such as South Russia, and it is computedthat at the present time upwards of 800 officers and8000 Other Rank3 in all are employed on duties for which no provision has beon made In the after-the-war establish-ment of the Royal Air Force,The inevitable consequence is that the permanentstations at Rome and Overseas are dangerously undermanned;,a state of affairs which gravely retards the work of re-organisation and reconstruction, and in especial, the carrying into effect of the essential programme for thetraining of the future Royal Air Force.Early action is necessary if a breakdown is tobe avoided,, and I would urge the Tar Cabinet either(l)   to give their general sanction to the proposalsfor the formation of Disposal Corps contained inthe resolution of an Inter-Departmental Conferenceconvened to discuss the matter which has been already submitted to the Cabinet or failing this(2)   to authorise the Air Ministry to enter a certainnumber of civilians forthwith to perform theduties which will fall to a Disposal Corps, if andwhen formed (ioC to undertake the storage,custody, and handling of material surplus to Royal&apos; Air Force requirements, and generally theirpreparation for disposal), and to engage sufficienttemporary officers to ouperviso the work with aview to its completion in the most economicaland expeditious manner practicable.fflNSTON S, CHTJRCHILL.The Air Ministry.7th January, 1920,
