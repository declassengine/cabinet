Sir Eric Geddes is considering this morning the question of Issuing it to the 0ress at once for publication.(Signed)   Thomas Jones.Act ing Secretary, - CabinetWh i t eha 11 Cs r d en s, 13.&apos;?,15th January, 1920.
I have new had an opportunity of discussing with my colleagues in the Government, including thePrime Minister and the other members of the cabinet who are now in Paris, the resolutions passed at theSpecial General Meeting of the National Union of Rail-waymen on 9th January*     I have further held a meeting with this delegation appointed by the IJnion for the purposewho explained the reasons which led to the rejection ofthe proposals made to them by the Government in regard to railway wages and recommended to them by their ownaccredited representatives*     The reply which I am now about to make is the decision of the Government, givenafter a careful consideration of all the points whichhave been stated.The issues which have to. be decided touch the life of every citizen of the country because the costs ofthe Railways are paid by all those who travel and.sendgoods by them&apos;    While, therefore, it is necessary tobe just and fair to the Railwaymen, it is essentialalso to take into account the capacity of the other sections of the community to bear increased charges.Having these considerations in view, the Government, in framing the present proposals, were animated by a desireto go to the limit of fair concession to those who work  the Railwayso     The fact that the scheme secured therecommendation of the representatives of the men with whom the negotiations were conducted, demonstrates thatthe proposals&apos;cannot be regarded as unreasonable,.Before proceeding to deal with the particular points raised in the resolutions, it is necessary to direct attention to a feature of the present position which cannot be allowed to pass without comments     Thenegotiations with regard to the conditions of Railwayservice have been proceedingt since February 1919c    Atthe outset, a demand was made to the effect that every/man
IB?man should receive as a minimum permanent wage thehighest wage of the grade to which he belonged, togetherwith the full amount of the allowances which had been added during the war owing to the increased cost ofliving.     This demand the Government found it Impossible,in the public interest, to concede.     As the result, astrike took place in the month of September, which ended in a resumption of work, without any concession beingmade in regard to the claim mentioned:-,     Following thestrike, the Prime Minister reiterated to the executive of the National Union of Railwaymen that this demand   ,could not be granted^     Thereafter negotiations were resumed which resulted in the adoption by both parties of the average wage of each grade as the basis of cal-speculation, and a sliding scale to meet changes in cost ofliving:   and the representatives of the men recommendedthis arrangement to their constituents as a reasonable *     The delegates of the men have now, inrejecting this arrangement, reverted to their originalclaim and have disregarded the effect of all thenegotiations which have taken place during the last ten months, as well as the recommendations of their ownrepresentatives.It is plain that if this method of conductingproceedings is to be followed, collective bargaining;upon which the Railwaymen laid so much stress some months ago, must be seriously jeopardised.     Negotiations cannotbe conducted with bodies which number hundreds of thousands of members, except through accredited represent-atives, and if protracted negotiations between theGovernment and such representatives are treated by theirconstituents as negligible, all collective bargaining willbe rendered futile and one of the most important and usefulfunctions of Trade Unions will come to an end.     Theposition in the present instance is greatly aggravated bythe fact that the employer is not a privste individual/ or
or company, but the State.No question of private profit at presentarises^.     The Community is already compelled to meet a large deficit on the current working of the Railwaysand although this is now about to &quot;be transferred to theusers of the Railways by increases in Railway rates,this only establishes a different method of making theCommunity shoulder the burden^     Incidentally anincrease in Railway Rates imposes a tax upon the industry of the Country and increases the financial burden on every citizen.\\\ h\\\\v\\\\\/The
The principal points raised by you yesterday were asIt was claimed that the standard rates should bebased on the highest pre-war rate paid in any gradeI and not on the average pre-war rates of the grade \as in the Government proposals.The application of any sliding scale based on thecost of living was objected to.It was pointed out that certain grades have notbeen dealt with, as they do not come under anyshop or dock agreements or within any grade coming within the conciliation scheme, and it was asked that the case of these grades should be dealt with.Attention was drawn to individual cases of hardshipin which under the Government proposals men would suffer in their weekly wage after the 30th&apos;September next, even if oost of living remained atthe same levelsIt was claimed that the advantage which mightaccrue to any man through standardization shouldhave retrospective effect from August 18th,1919.It was urged that the case of Ireland should bemet, the Government proposals relating only tomen employed on the controlled Railways in GreatBritain,
jUpon these point I have the following observationsto make *Standard rates of^jmgeStWhile the Government would be prepared to .deal with cases of individual hardship in the way which will be mentionedlater, they cannot depart from their attitude which they have throughout adopted of refusing this demandfAs already explained the negotiations since the strikehci&apos;7e proceeded upon the basis of the average rate of wage ineach grade/, and to grant the claim now again revived would adda greatly increased cost tc charges which are already veryburdensome to the country and its industry.Sliding ScaletWith regard to the objection which is taken tc theapplication of a sliding scale based on cost of living, theGovernment consider that any attempt to standardise wages underthe present abnormal conditions must necessarily be accompanied&apos;by such a -scale; future variations upwards or downwards in thecost cf living can be met In no other satisfactory way.In dealing with the question cf a sliding scale itshould be noted that such scale only becomes operative on sums which are in excess of a minimum rate of wage which averagesdouble the pre-war rate./war
War Wage for. Wages grades not included In the Proposalsnow under consideration!If the settlement which I am now suggesting is accepted in its entirety an instruction will be given thatthe sura of 5/-* contained In the proposals for adult men in&apos;the Conciliation Grades shall be extended as an addition tothe war wage of women and of all adult men (in grades otherthan those embraced in the Conciliation scheme) to whom, thewar wage of 20/6d for women and 33/- for men applies inaccordance with previous agreements entered into with theN.U.R. and A.S.L.E*&amp; P.An ino3c5ease of 2/6 shall similarly be made to boysand girls under 18 years of age.An increase in the war wage will be given to men andwomen in other wages grades who do not now receive the full war wage referred to above which shall be relatively comparable towhat they now receive.This arrangement will not apply to the drivers, firemenand cleaners in the locomotive department (whose rates of payhave already-been agreed)/ to clerical staff (male and female),to men who are in receipt of the or l\% fconus or to men employed in the Bocks and Marine Departments where such menbenefited by awards given through other channels,(Cs Individual/

It is &quot;beyond doubt that this alternative would give the men,in the aggregate, a considerably larger amount than, they would receiveif retrospective pay were given under tho arrangement confirmed by the Prime Minister,.    At the same time it is realised that,whereas the great majority of the men would benefit by the newoffer, some few men would not obtain the full advantage whichthey would have obtained under the Prime Minister ls undertaking.If desired, the Government are prepared to adopt the more? detailed and laborious method of calculating each case separately.     Thelabour involved will be grea . it cannot be accomplished promptly,nor will the total payment to the men be so great.   , nevertheless it is for the men to decide,,IrelandcThe Government are willing to extend to Ireland theprinciple of tho proposals now made for/grades other than drivers,firemen and cleaners, that is to say the average pro-war weeklyrate of a grade or group of grades on the Irish Railways, shall boascertained and the cum of 38/-! shall be added thereto to form therate for that grade or group of grades as long as the cost of livingremains at 125;; above the pre-war cost&apos;,    These rates shall besubjoct to the operation of the sliding scale as proposed for GreatBritain, with &quot;stops&quot; formed on the same principle as in the offer of December 22nd.The Government are prepared to agree that rates fixed fordrivers, firemen and cleaners in Great Britain shall be extendedtc tho broad gauge railways in Ireland with the exception of roadrailways&apos;, and that a lower scale of rates shall be set up for the narrow gauge and road railways:^;The settlements for Ireland shall apply as from the same datesas operate in Great Britain so far as is administratively practicable.In the event of difficulties arising the subject shall be discussed between the men&apos;s Unions and the Ministry of Transport.
