From Brevet Lieut.-Col. A. T. Wilson, C.S.I., C.M.G., C.I.E., D.S.O., ActingCivil Commissioner in Mesopotamia, Baghdad, to the Secretary of State forIndia, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.1.I have the honour to enclose herewith an interesting and valuable note by MissG. L. Bell, C.B.E., entitled &quot; Syria in 1919.&quot; l&quot; &apos;A few comments thereon in so far as it directly affects these territories areperhaps called for from me.2. The fundamental assumption throughout this note and, I should add,throughout recent official correspondence which has reached me from London, isthat an Arab State in Mesopotamia and elsewhere within a short period of years isa possibility, and that the recognition or creation of a logical scheme of Governmenton these lines, in supersession of those on which we are now working in Mesopo-tamia, would be practicable and popular; in other words, the assumption is that theAnglo-French Declaration of November 8th, 1918, represents a practical line ofpolicy to pursue in the near future.3. My observations in this country and elsewhere have forced me to the convic-tion that this assumption is erroneous, and though I am aware that in holding thisview I differ from authorities and observers both at home and abroad who possess abreadth of vision and a wealth of experience to which I can lay no claim, I venture,probably for the last time, in my present capacity, to lay before His Majesty&apos;s-Government the considerations which have led me to this conclusion.4. I believe it to be impossible in these days to create a new sovereignMohammadan State by diplomatic or administrative means out of the remnants ofthe Turkish Empire.5. On local grounds because I believe the sentiments of the majority ofMohammadans in this country to be hostile to any practical interpretation of sucha conception that we can devise. The warlike Kurds in Mesopotamia, who numbernearly half a million, will never accept an Arab ruler, and they are potentially a powerful disruptive force. The Shiahs of Mesopotamia, who number aboutIf millions, will accept no form of Arab Government based upon Sunni domination,and no form of Arab Government has yet been envisaged, except the Divisional and provincial councils provisionally approved and now in process of formation, whichwould not involve a practical monopoly of power by Sunnis. As far as I know the Young Baghdadi party in Syria does not include amongst its members a singleShiah.The Shiah Community would be reluctant to see the Turks return but a turkish Administration would have less difficulty in asserting itself in the provincesthan an Arab Government; the tradition of the past 200 years and the prestige ofthe Sultanate and Caliphate are still strong.6. If an Arab Government were constituted by decree of the League of nations or by other extraneous authority, and maintained for a period by our arms and ourmoney, it is my belief that the Arab public at large would after a very few yearsactively favour the return of the Turks to the continuance of an amateur ArabGovernment. The Jewish and Christian Communities, who number about 200,000,but have an influence disproportionate to their numbers, would probably adopt asimilar attitude; such a demand would be most difficult to combat and might spread to practically the whole of the former Turkish Empire. It is not improbable thatthe British commercial communities in Mesopotamia would lend such a movementtheir support, in their own immediate interests.Sir,No. 344436/75/19.Office of the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad,15th November 1919.10  615  75,100 &apos; 1/20  f.o.p.   t1925]B
7. Three-quarters of the population of this country are tribespeople with noprevious tradition of obedience to any Government except that of Constantinople,and with an almost instinctive hostility to Arab &quot; Effendis&quot; in positions of authority; this hostility has been repeatedly demonstrated during the past two years in Mesopotamia.I therefore regard the creation of an Arab Government on the lines advocated by Yasin Pasha and Naji Bey as inconsistent with effective British Administrationor indeed with effective control of any sort. For some years to come the appoint-ment of Arab Governors or high officials, except in an advisory capacity, wouldinvolve the rapid decay of authority, law and order, followed by anarchy, and disorder, and the movement once started would not be checked; fanaticism notnationalism would become the ruling motive. Our financial stability depends onour ability to collect taxes, and if revenue-paying districts do not accept theGovernment that we set up we shall at once be bankrupt. We must, therefore, goslowly. Effective British Administration is vital to the continued existence ofMesopotamia as an independent State or administrative entity.8. The disruptive forces at work all over the world are not less active in theMiddle East than elsewhere; if we raise members of the Sharifian family topre-eminence in the Arab countries we shall have before long to support them by force of arms against a formidable group of dissentients. Bin Saud, Bin Rashid,The Imam, The Idrisi, and other Arabian potentates will never recognise theirsupremacy and within a few years will be in active opposition; nor can theSharifian family reckon on popular or democratic support.9. To sum up, I believe that any form of Administration that we adopt basedupon the conception of an Arab State is bound within a few years to result in theretrocession of a considerable part, if not the whole of Mesopotamia to the oneIslamic Power which still commands general respect, viz., Turkey, unless we areprepared to utilize our armed forces to support an ineffective and unpopularindigenous administration against its internal and external enemies.10. The probable effect of the creation of an Arab State on Persia also meritsconsideration. The fresh responsibilities which we have recently assumed in persia depend in my view for their successful initiation and execution upon theexistence of an effective British Administration in Mesopotamia.&quot; . 11. To revert to the all-important Kurdish question, which fills much of ourlocal horizon at present.It is very noticeable that Turkish propaganda during the past 12 months has been little in evidence amongst the Arab elements of Mesopotamia, but has beenexceedingly active amongst the Kurds, who number approximately from one-fifth of the total population of the three Wilayats.The repatriation of Christians, the repeated announcements of EuropeanStatesmen regarding an Armenian State, the action of European Powers at Smyrnaand elsewhere, are all subjects which Turkey has not failed to turn to our disad-vantage. The fresh graves of 5 Political Officers scattered along the NorthernBorder of the Mosul Wilayet testify to the success of this propaganda, nor have weyet seen its full development.12. The atmosphere of resentment thus created has been favourable to the spread of Turkish pan-Islamic doctrines against which we have no effectiveantidote; our promises to Armenians, the arrests of Kurds by British military officers in Syria, Aintab, Urfa, and elsewhere, Greek aggression in Smyrna, theseare facts which our qualified assurances to Kurds do not go far to counterbalance.More recently the behaviour of French troops in Syria and elsewhere, and the pro-Armenian attitude of United States&apos; representatives, have tended to harden popularfeeling against us as the representatives of an anti-Moslem League.In this atmosphere it is difficult if not impossible to create the fringe ofautonomous Kurdish States which has been authorised, and indeed until theNorthern Boundary of Mesopotamia has been decided on, it is difficult if not impossible to give the local Chiefs such assurances as will justify them in throwingin their lot with us.13. Our financial stake in this country is now so great that we are, it seemrto me, committed, in our own national interests, to a degree of responsibility inrelation to its affairs which must inevitably conflict sharply with the early creationeven in name of an Arab Administration.
British capital sunk in this country at the end of 1919 may be estimated asfollows:  Miscellaneous assets, including Port (Hewetfs report),to be transferred to Civil Administration      ...   2,000,000Railway (excluding assets of Baghdad Railways) ...   8,500,000Road to Kazvin ...............     500,000British Commercial capital at present locked up in country (shipping, banks, and trade)    ......   5,000,000The above estimate takes no account of military expenditure.14. The capitalized value of the oil-fields may be taken as 50,000,000Z. at a low valuation. Other minerals, coal, copper, iron, &amp;c, are known to exist inKurdistan (Sulaimaniyah region).15. Imports, uncertainty and shipping difficulties notwithstanding, havetrebled since 1913 and now stand at 16,000,0002. per annum, of which 10,000,000/.is from the United Kingdom. Shortage of shipping and high freights have prevented the growth of exports which stand for the last 12 months at  ,000,000Z.These figures include transit trade.16. At the present moment there are in Mesopotamia about 200 British Officials of Civil Administration of whom 60 have their families with them (excluding Railways and other quasi militarydepartments).120 British-born subjects belonging to British commercial firms of whomabout 40 have their families with them.200 British-born subjects in subordinate positions in the Civil Adminis-tration (excluding Railways and other quasi military departments).80 ditto with commercial firms.50 European Foreign subjects.4,000 to 5,000 Indians drawing over Rs. 200 in the employ of the civil administration or of British firms or in business on their own account or in the employ of native firms.This excludes Labour Corps personnel.The presence of this large body of British and foreign subjects in the countryinvolves His Majesty&apos;s Government and its representative on the spot in greatresponsibilities, and cannot be without effect upon the attitude to be adopted towards constitutional experiments.17. The currency of this country consists of Indian Currency Notes to the valueof about 20 crores of rupees and current rupees and small coin to the value of about crores, together with about 4,000,000Z. in Turkish gold which is scarcely in circulation.The reserve of coin which is,held in Mesopotamia against the local currentIndian Currency Notes is about ^ crore of rupees, a figure considerably below thesafe minimum.Any diminution in the authority of Government would shake the local financialedifice to its foundations and would involve widespread disaster to British andlocal trade interests.18. I readily recognise that there are many other factors besides those referredto above requiring the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government, many of whichare necessarily beyond my purview.I have nevertheless ventured to place the foregoing local aspects of the question before Government in the hope that it may yet be possible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment not to commit itself to a policy which must in the practicallyunanimous opinion of its Officers in this country and of the local public operatedisastrously to the interests of this country.19. I believe that the Divisional and Provincial Councils provisionallysanctioned and now in process of formation, if allowed to develop and assisted toassume a due share of local responsibility, will in a comparatively short space oftime give the public at large that measure of participation and control of their localdestinies which is necessary to ensure stability of the administration, and will serve
as a training ground for the development of administrative talent which may fit thepeople of these countries ultimately to control their own destinies. Many years will not elapse before the people of this Country will be at least as well equipped asthe people of Egypt or India now are for Western forms of Government, but forthe present the population is so deeply divided by racial and religious cleavages,and the Shiah majority after 200 years of Sunni domination are so little accustomed to hold high office, that any attempt to introduce institutions on the lines desired bythe advanced Sunni politicians of Syria would involve the concentration of power inthe hands of a few persons whose ambitions and methods would rapidly bring aboutthe collapse of organized Government.20. Finally, if I may be permitted to make a personal reference, I beg leave to assure Government that by birth, by training and by temperament, I am in sympathy with a democratic as opposed to a bureaucratic conception of Government,and if I find myself unable to advocate the immediate introduction of a logicalscheme of Arab Government into Mesopotamia it is because I believe that the results would be the antithesis of a democratic Government and that the creation andmaintenance at.this stage of an indigenous Arab Government is inconsistent withthe changes which we are now endeavouring to introduce into the Governments ofIndia and Egypt, changes the necessity for which I fully recognise and with whichI am broadly speaking in sympathy.1 have sent a copy of this letter with enclosures to the Government of India.I have, &amp;c., A. T. Wilson, Lieut.-Col., Indian Army,Acting Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia.ENCLOSURE.   &apos;Syria in October 1919.From an official report of the Peace Conference:1st Statesman: The Country will be very badly governed.2nd Statesman: Why should it not be badly governed \3rd Statesman: It ought to be badly governed.The fortnight which I spent in Syria (4th October to 20th October) fell at a timeof acute political uncertainty and apprehension. Although preliminary evacuationorders were received by the British Military Authorities two days before I leftAleppo, no official communication on the subject had been made to the people of thecountry. There was nowhere any real belief that the British Army of Occupationwould be withdrawn from O.E.T. East, West and North, still less that it would be withdrawn immediately, and there was the same refusal to credit that France would receive the mandate for Syria.&quot; Nevertheless, dismay had been aroused by thepublication in the &quot;Temps&quot; of the gist of the agreement arrived at byMr. Clemenceau, Mr. Lloyd George, and Lord Allenby on the 16th September, andthe effect of a possible withdrawal of our troops was being anxiously discussed.The organisation established a/ter the occupation of the country was still inforce, and to a Mesopotamian Officer it was somewhat bewildering to find that it was based upon a sharp differentiation between Administrative and Political functions.In the roughest outline it was as follows : In charge of Administration were four Chief Administrators, a British general in O.E.T. South with headquarters at Jerusalem, a Syrian magnate in O.E.T. Eastwith headquarters at Damascus, and Frenchmen in O.E.T. West and North withheadquarters at Beyrut and Adana. The Administrative staff was respectivelyBritish, Arab, and French. Each C.A. was directly responsible to the G.O.C.-in-Chief of E.E.F. A British G.S.0.1 was entrusted with the task of co-ordinating,as far as it was possible, the different and divergent administrations. This officer,originally attached to the G.O.C.-in-Chief&apos;s Headquarters when they were at Haifa,remained at Haifa, though the Military Headquarters had been removed to Cairo.The Political Officers off E.E.F., unlike those of M.E.F., had no concern withAdministration, but may be described as Political Intelligence Officers.   At their
head was a C.P.0 responsible to the Foreign Office much in the same manner, in hislimited scope, as the Mesopotamian Civil Commissioner is responsible to the IndiaOffice. His Headquarters were the Military Headquarters at Cairo, and he wasserved by Political Officers posted in the four divisions of O.E.T. All four divisions were in British Military Occupation, but the French had in the two Divisions whichthey administered a small force under the supreme command of the G.O.C.-in-Chief,and the Arab Government in, O.E.T. East was permitted to maintain an armylimited to 8,000 men and in fact somewhat below that figure.The task of administration in O.E.T. South, which had fallen to our share andis likely to remain on our shoulders, is complicated by the Zionist question. without exception, the Moslems and Christians, who together form nine-tenths of thepopulation, are opposed to the claims of the Jews. They fear that Jewish immigra-tion cannot fail to rob them of the lands which they have inherited from their fathers,and the Moslems are not unnaturally suspicious of projects which promise to alter the numerical balance of the population in favour of the Jews. The acquisition ofland for purposes of colonization is the corner stone of Zionism. The Jews do not contemplate the eviction of existing proprietors; they propose to achieve their aimsby buying from the British Administration all State lands, by taking up andcultivating waste lands, and by a law obliging landowners to sell any portion oftheir estates which they have not brought under cultivation. By these means they hope to find room for about 2,000,000 settlers, and as the present population ofPalestine does not amount to more than 1\ millions all told, Jews would be largely inexcess of Moslems. Moreover,&apos;the Moslems are at least very doubtful whether smallproprietors will be restrained by patriotic motives from selling land to Zionists ifthe price offered be sufficiently tempting, more especially as the war has brought them into great straits. In order to enable cultivators to tide over the next two or threedifficult years, the British Administration advanced agricultural loans through the medium of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank. The arrangement/gave great satisfaction to the moslems, but the Zionists objected to it on several grounds. They feared that itwould give a footing in the country to the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, which, togetherwith all other Egyptian Institutions, they wish to exclude from Palestine. Theycomplained that Jewish cultivators were unable to take advantage of the loansowing to technical difficulties in&quot; establishing their title to the land. UnderOttoman law, no Jew, unless he had been born in Palestine, could hold land; a non-Palestinian Jew would therefore hold in the name of a Palestinian co-religionist,with a resulting confusion in land records. They urged, further, that Moslem titledeeds were equally uncertain, but that the fact that we had given loans on existingtitle deeds would make it difficult in future to dispute them. The second objection is not valid, as Jews can obtain Agricultural loans through the Anglo Jewish Bank,and it is probable that the Zionists were mainly actuated by a wish to take advantageof the exceptionally favourable opportunity offered by the, indigence of Moslemproprietors. Their protest was effective; the loans were discontinued, to the bitterdisappointment of the Moslems, who saw in the action of H.M.G. confirmation oftheir dread that Moslem interests would always hold an inferior place in our councils.A permanent and increasing source of controversy is the language question.English, Arabic, and Hebrew are all three recognised as official languages in O.E.T.South, and all proclamations and regulations emanating from the central administra-tion are issued in triplicate. This is strongly objected to by the Moslems, who holdthat Hebrew should have no official recognition.The Zionists have recently demanded that orders issued by the JerusalemMunicipality should be in Hebrew as well as in Arabic. The municipal body, notelected but appointed by the British Administration, is composed of some 12 to14 members, of whom only two are Jews; the Mayor is an Arab notable. TheChief Administrator requested him toi comply with the demand of the Zionists, andthe Mayor, with the municipal body almost solidly behind him,, refused to do so. no solution of this deadlock had been reached, nor did either side show signs of givingway.If both parties would exercise forbearance, it is conceivable that the Zionistsmight obtain a good deal of what they want without forcing the Moslems to relinquish much of what they have got, but I could see no tendency to moderationamong the latter, and no intention among the former to go forward with caution.Mr. Weizmann&apos;s representative in Jerusalem, Dr. Eder, rejects the idea that Zionismcan be allowed to proceed slowly. It will be necessary, he maintains, to impress uponthe Arabs that the Zionist regime can effect without delay great improvements in the
country, by which Arabs will benefit no less than Jews. The increase of materialwell-being he regards as the most persuasive of arguments, and no doubt up to apoint he is right. He relies upon the close affinity of the two civilizations and seesno reason why races so nearly akin should not merge completely. The immigrantJews will bring with them the advantage of Western culture which, by the fact oftheir being orientals, they are better fitted than Europeans to impart to the Arabs.They will not attempt to turn their Arab fellow citizens into a bad imitation ofOccidentals, and by working, hand in hand with them along familiar lines they will ultimately extend a common civilization from Palestine to Mesopotamia.It is easy to criticize the exponent of such an ideal, not the least among obvious objections being that the Western Jew does not as a rule set much store on thementality of the East or wish to maintain it, but it would be correspondinglydifficult to deny the enthusiasm and the high hopes for the realisation of a nationalexistence which inspire men like Dr. Eder. He is himself an interesting, if perhaps a rare example of reversion to type. Though a Jew by birth, his father was a Free-thinker, and the son received in youth no religious training, nor any instruction inHebrew. Not being endowed with a gift for languages, he has no intention oflearning either Hebrew or Arabic. He has never previously been in the East, yet heand his wife have left their home in London and propose to settle permanently inJerusalem. Already Dr. Eder says that he feels at home among Arabs, admirestheir virtues and would be content to be as oriental as they.Every Moslem with whom I conversed touched on one of the points of Dr.Eder&apos;s argument, but in a different spirit. Their chief pre-occupation is that theywill be unable to compete with the better education and greater skill of the Jewishimmigrant from Europe. Some of the old-established Jewish families share thisfear. Of the local Jew the Moslem is not afraid, nor would he refuse to him ashare in Palestinian administration, always provided that the Jew held office in virtue of his being a Palestinian and not in virtue of his being a Jew.The Christians will be as little pleased as the Moslems at the advent of aZionist State. A combined society has been formed with a Moslem president inJerusalem and a Christian President in Jaffa to oppose the absorption of thecountry by the Zionists.   Anti-Zionism is the only bond which holds it together.There is one point on which Zionists and anti-Zionists are in agreement. Bothare dissatisfied with the part which the British Government has played in the controversy, the Zionists because we have not given their cause sufficient support,the Moslems because we have supported it too much. This sentiment amongPalestinian Moslems, coupled with a universal dislike of the partition of Syriabetween different mandatories, for which they hold us to be largely responsible, has given their opinions an anti-British tinge from which Faisal has benefited auto-matically. Union with an independent Arab State would be preferred to a british mandate burdened with obligations towards the Jews, and it is significant that among Faisal&apos;s followers the Palestinians at Damascus are the strongest advocates of an Arab State without foreign control of any kind. But not even to avoidpartition,- nor as a possible escape from the threat of Zionism would a Frenchmandate be acceptable to Mohammadans, either in Jerusalem or in Damascus.T reached Damascus about midnight on the 7th October, after a railway journeyof some 16 hours from Ludd. Early next morning I walked through the bazaarsto the Mosque of the Umayyads and received my first impressions of the Arabadministration which had been in existence for 11 months. The most salientfeature was that the town was many degrees dirtier than it had ever been in Turkishtimes. The bazaars were littered with vegetable and other refuse and secludedcorners were no better than receptacles for filth of all descriptions. Not quite soeasy to define was the sense that the political atmosphere had changed. Underthe Turks every foreigner was a potential consul, and as such worthy of respect;under the existing regime he is an equal who, lest he should suppose himself to beanything better, must be kept in his place. In crowded quarters I found this process to be attended with inconvenience.The Chief Administrator of O.E.T., East, Ali Ridha Pasha Rikabi, is aDamascene. He is an ex-Turkish Official and has held posts of importance inBasrah, Baghdad, and elsewhere, but at the beginning of the war the ottoman government regarded him with suspicion as a member of the Young Arab Party.He maintains unimpaired, as chief officer of the Arab State under the Amir Faisal,the traditions of the Turkish service. He is inefficient, corrupt, and courteous.He is believed to be an upholder of complete Arab independence, but except for an
ardent hostility to the French, he appeared to me to have no fixed politicalprinciples. He counts for little and holds his position on an extremely uncertaintenure.His junior by ten years, and a man of very different calibre, is Yasin Pasha,Chief of the Military Council. Yasin Pasha is a Baghdadi of the lower middleclass. His family came originally from the neighbourhood of Kirkuk, and he may therefore be of Turkish, though not of Ottoman descent. His father was in theemploy of Muhammad Pasha Daghistani. Yasin, who is between 35 and 40, hasbeen absent from Baghdad in Turkish military service for the last ten years. Heis a late adherent to the Arab cause. He was serving in the Turkish army untilthe occupation of Damascus, and was left behind wounded when the Turksretreated. He is now one of the extreme exponents of Arab independence asagainst a French mandate or any other form of foreign control. He is in touchwith the C.U.P. and with Mustafa Kamal, and his personal sympathies are probably Turkish. If the Arab State collapses, I should say that he would seekand find his fortune with the Ottoman Government. Meantime he has influence with Faisal and dominates Zaid who acts for Faisal during the latter&apos;s absence.Yasin is the moving spirit of the Ahd al &apos;Iraqi, the Mesopotamian League,composed of Mesopotamians, of whom there are about 300 in Faisal&apos;s service.With the exception of Yusaf Beg Suwaidi and a younger member of the BaitShawi, I know of none who belong to one of our influential families; they are in syria the counterpart of our local group of advanced young men whose claim to consideration is not necessarily that of birth. They were almost all in Turkishmilitary employment, and joined the Sharif after having been taken prisoners byus in the course of the war. Partly because of the positions they held in the Arabarmy, and partiy by reason of a native virility which distinguishes &apos; Iraqis, theyare the leading personalities in the Arab State. They hold all important militaryposts and therefore control the army, while in Aleppo the Governor and Deputy-Governor, Ja&apos;far Pasha al &apos;Askari and Yusuf Beg Suwaidi, are members of theAhd.The League is working nominally against the French mandate, actually forArab independence without foreign control both in Syria and in Mesopotamia.Some of its more moderate adherents may not be in full accord with its policy, butI doubt whether their views, even if they were freely expressed, would carry muchweight. As regards Syria, hatred of the French has given the inspiration to anti-foreign sentiments, and a wholly independent Mesopotamia is the natural corollaryto a wholly independent Syria. It is the object of the League to unite the twounder a single Arab Government. The extremists are convinced that british administration in the Traq is and must remain the opponent of political liberty andthat under a British mandate no attempt will be made to set up responsible Arabgovernment. They say that they receive innumerable complaints about existing conditions from correspondents in Mesopotamia and from Mesopotamians who,according to them, are coming over in great numbers in order to escape from thetyranny of British Rule. The more moderate members of the League are equallycertain that grave discontent exists among all the classes in the &apos;Iraq and theyassured me, in particular, that the Shi&apos;ah tribes were bitterly hostile to us, but inconversing with me they laid the blame on our native officials and police.When I asked what kind of people were coming from Mesopotamia to Syriain the numbers described I never elicited any definite answer. It is probable thatthey are chiefly ex-Government employes who have not found a place under theexisting administration, and that their number is exaggerated. As regards the allegation that the Shi&apos;ah tribes are disaffected, it is universally denied in Baghdadand by the local officers who are in touch with the tribes in question. I understoodthat the charge made against our native officials was due to a desire on the part ofmy interlocutors not to wound my susceptibilities by attributing blame to british officers. If it is true that the native officials are at fault, it is difficult to see howany relaxation of direct British control can mend matters.Chief among the grievances which were cited to me is the continuance of amilitary form of administration, which is indeed at the root of all complaints. A&apos;good deal of capital is made out of the retention of commandeered houses&apos; in baghdad, as well as out of the banishment last February of certain persons whowere sowing- dissension in the interests of the Turks if I remember rightly these were 7 in number and all but one were Turks and ex-Turkish officials, but when
I mentioned that the banishments had been made at the direct request of Baghdadmagnates, I was met with the rejoinder that families like the Naqib Zadah andthe Jamil Zadah are of no account with the younger group of politicians.There has recently been a split in the Ahd al &apos; Iraqi by three baghdad is, all of whom I met. Isma&apos;il Haqqi, a man of about 35, was a divisional commander in the Arab army and is now head of the Technical Department. Subhi Halim,who may be 5 years younger, is Mudarris al Mukakim al &apos;Askariyah, Safar alDin of the Bait Mamun, aged about 25, is in civil employment in Damascus. these three told me that they deeply regretted the universal discontent with British rulewhich they believed to exist in Mesopotamia. They recognised that the countrycannot do without our help and protection, and they offered to come themselves toBaghdad to serve as intermediaries between ourselves and the inhabitants. Theywould expect to be given office as they would be obliged to reliquish the positionsthey hold in Syria. They expressed a hope that Sir Percy Cox would return to mesopotamia as High Commissioner when civil government was instituted. I was told by all Political Officers in Syria that they believed from what they heard fromthe Traqis who are with Faisal that the appointment of Sir Percy would do morethan any other measure to allay their mistrust. The Amir Zaid said the same thing. He too spoke to me with great earnestness of Mesopotamian grievances,his chief source of information being the reports brought back by Naji Beg Suwaidi.I do not think that the Mesopotamian League is a negligible factor. As longas the Arab State continues it will carry on an active propaganda which might atany moment raise difficulties in our path, and if, on the withdrawal of troops fromSyria, disturbances occur in that country it will be the first object of the more extreme among i/ts&quot; members to advertise their grievances by inciting Mesopotamianmalcontents to open revolt against a British mandate. Judging by the experienceof last January it would be impossible to say with confidence that efforts in thisdirection would meet with no success in Baghdad, Karbala, and Najaf. It must always be remembered that in the rural districts it has not up to now produced anyapparent results. At the same time I feel certain that the propaganda proposed bythe cave would be of no use to us. I was favourably impressed by Isma&apos;il Haqqi,but, to the best of my belief, neither he nor his friends have any personal influence in Baghdad, while if they took office under us their opinions would at once be discounted.With Yasin Pasha I had two long conversations. I asked him to explain to mewhat his programme would be for the future government of &apos;Iraq. He replied thathe would give me his personal views, but that he thought we should find it necessaryto consult all leading Arab politicians, especially those who had had experience ofself-government in Syria. It was obvious that; Mesopotamia could not for the next10 years be left without foreign guidance, and equally obvious that no foreignnation except England had any claim to act as adviser. In that respect the country had a great advantage over Syria. No one gives anything for nothing, and if weprovided for immediate requirements we should ask for guarantees. This is to say,we must for the present control the administration. Economic developments wouldbe easy and rapid. He refused to believe that Great Britain would not be in aposition to furnish unlimited capital, and he brushed aside the objection that thelocal population was not sufficiently numerous to carry out the vast scheme which he contemplated. An Arab Amir must be set up as head of the State and whateverexisting opinion might be, Abdullah would sweep the board the moment he appeared in Mesopotamia. It was true that Sir Percy Cox was at present better known therethan any of the sons of the Sharif, and even possible that he had a greater name,but that was only because he had lived and worked in the country for 3 years,He should be appointed High Commissioner. The Amir would be assisted by an advisory council appointed by himself with the advice of the High Commissioner.This council would consist mainly of British officials, but there was no reason whysuitable Arabs, if such were to be found, should not find a place upon it. Theministers would all be Arabs appointed by the Amir with the advice of the council.The country was not ready for representative institutions; nevertheless in theprovinces an Arab Wali, with a British Adviser, might well be assisted by an electedmajlis, it being clearly understood that the powers of the majlis were strictly limited to local matters. These councils would train the people in the uses of repre-sentation and in time lead up to a central elective assembly. It was probable thatthere was not yet in Mesopotamia a sufficient number of trustworthy and capablemen to fill the high- offices of the State, but that difficulty would be met by calling in
men from outside. It was clear that Yasin alluded to the Baghdadi group in Syria,Close administrative union between Mesopotamia and Syria was essential. It wouldhave been better if both countries had been placed under a single mandate, failingwhich similar judicial and educational systems must be established and no commer-cial restrictions must be imposed between the two provinces. A British army ofoccupation would be needed at first, but as long as we were in military occupationthe sovereignty would remain in our hands, whatever professions we might make tothe contrary. An Arab army could be created in six months and would be capableof replacing British troops. Yasin accused us of having purposely neglected educa-tion, which was a matter of vital importance. He went so far as to say that hewould be content to leave both sovereignty and administration in our hands if wewould provide the young men of the &apos;Iraq with a sound education, which wouldmean that in a generation they could and would replace us. There were plenty of schools in Turkish times; no matter how bad they were, we should have continuedthem and sought to improve them gradually. Without waiting to establish a goodsystem of primary and secondary schools, it was our duty to found and endow (withfunds the origin of which he did not specify) a college which would provideuniversity training. For this purpose technical schools had little value. &quot; you may possibly create through them good farmers and good engineers, but in fifty-years&apos; time we shall be no further forward in obtaining a class of highly educatedmen fit to take over the government of the country.&quot;I have given a full summary of Yasin&apos;s views because, in the first place, he wasthe only man who gave me anything like a connected scheme for the Government ofthe &apos;Iraq, and in the second place, they appear to me to be in general outlinesound and reasonable. His educational programme I believe to be wide of the mark;as regards the preservation of public security by an Arab army got together in sixmonths, the best comment is supplied by the Arab army in Syria which as it now stands is largely Yasin&apos;s creation. It contains no natives of the Hijaz nor anytribesmen of the desert; such of the latter as accompanied Faisal to Damascushaving melted away shortly after the occupation. A large proportion of the officers are baghdad is. Some 7,200 is the present strength, out of a permitted 8,000, andthis includes 400 officers above the prescribed number. It is an open secret that these additional officers are to be used to raise levies for guerilla warfare if resistance isoffered to the French, but no protest against this breach of regulations has beenmade by us. Conscription was abolished when the Arab Government was estab-lished; nevertheless the Arab Military Council recently drew up a conscription order,including a six-monthly exemption fine of 36Z., which would have fallen heavily onChristians and Jews. A delay of three weeks on our part in paying the monthlysubsidy to the Sharif brought the Military Council to heel and the order did not take effect. There is no punishment for desertion. The troops are paid about 31. amonth, and it is not unusual for men to desert in handfuls, whole villages at a time,after every pay day. No one supposes that the Arab army would face regular troops;it is not even believed that the Damascus garrison, 2,000 strong, would stand up tothe Beduin if they were to come in force after we withdraw. It is a reflection uponYasin&apos;s administrative capacity that he should not have done better with the army.He has had large sums of secret service money at his disposal, but these he has usedin propaganda, reserving a heavy percentage for his own pocket. The Arab leadersknow that the army will be no good to them against the French, and they rely onguerilla warfare and local levies. The whole country is armed to the tune of anaverage of two rifles per man, with ammunition sufficient to last a year. At a moderate estimate there are 75,000 rifles in Damascus alone, but in and round Aleppoarms are said to be less numerous.Damascenes are exceedingly anxious at the prospect which lies before them. Atthe end of the year the subsidy to the Sharif will cease and the financial position ofthe Arab Government will be extremely precarious, but even if it can contrive tokeep itself in existence and succeed in preventing open disorder it is anticipatedthat the French in the coast provinces will foster disturbances, either by the con-tinuance of propaganda within the Arab State, or by provocative acts towardsMoslems in the area under their administration, and that on the first breach of thepeace their troops will cross the frontier on the plea of restoring order. Christiansof all sects believe that massacre is inevitable, and their fears are shared by most ofthe British officers in Syria. During the last 50 years the breach between Moslemsand Christians had gradually closed; *since 1860 massacre had been unknown in syria until the 28th February of this year, when some Armenians were massacred[1925&quot;! - 0
in Aleppo. But Moslem fanaticism has been excited by recent events, especially bythe obvious preference which the French have shown to the Maronites, from whomall their staff of interpreters and native officials is drawn. The Amir Zaid said thatthe Maronites of the Lebanon were being systematically armed by the French, whilefrom the local Druzes arms were being corespondingly called in. He also made apoint of the rapid repatriation of Armenian refugees from Aleppo so as to diminish the number of Christians who would be in danger if disturbances broke out. He isnot, therefore, without apprehensions. It is impossible to deny that the atmosphere of nervous expectation in which Christians and Moslems alike are living is thatwhich invariably accompanies religious conflict. The Greek Catholic Patriarch,Monseigneur Qadhi, a man whom I have known and trusted for years, told me that inthe Christian Quarter only the presence of British soldiers kept the people fom thoseattacks of panic which spread like a contagion to the Moslems and bring the latter toarms in self-defence against the imagined danger. No one who is familiar with thegrim insanity of massacre can fail to put an ominous interpretation upon the signsof the times, and if it is true, as I believe it is, that the initial incitement must always be supplied from outside the populace itself, there are grounds for sharing Mon-seigneur Qadhi&apos;s conviction that it will not be lacking. &quot; The chord of fanaticism,&quot;he said, &quot; has a greater resonance than the chord of.nationalism. The extreme party will reach the time when they can no longer play on nationalist sentiment; already itis almost worn out. Most Damascenes are tired of the long uncertainty whichdirectly affects their prosperity. When they refuse to respond to the demands madeon their patriotism, no alternative will remain but to revive the old religious hatred.&quot;I did not add that Faisal himself, in one of his less responsible moments, had declared that if the nations of Europe attempted to separate Palestine from Syriahe would proclaim a Jihad.The Patriarch^ description of Damascene feeling was confirmed by all the localmen with whom I conversed. Comfortable, ease-loving Damascus is tired of aGovernment which is perceptibly worse than that of the Turks. Under the Arabregime there is less public security; the law-courts are a trifle more venal, the highofficials no less corrupt than their predecessors, though this is not a source of seriouscomplaint, for nothing else is expected of high officials. Worst of all, trade lan-guishes. In the mists of personal inconvenience Faisal&apos;s romantic halo is growingdim. It is quite possible that Damascus if left to itself would accept the hatedFrench mandate if it would bring with it an assurance of peace and quiet andreviving prosperity. Indeed in the safe seclusion of the haram I was told as muchby my old friend the head of the noble and wealthy Kilani family. The moreambitious among the magnates have another grievance. They dislike the upstartband of baghdad is and Palestinians who are in authority over them, partly no doubtfrom a natural desire to share in such spoil as may be available, partly from an uneasyfeeling that the aliens for at this point the. conception of Arab unity becomesobscured are in fierce pursuit of an exaggerated political ideal for the attainment of which, or on the off chance of its attainment, they are prepared to set the Syrianprovince in a blaze. &quot; Death rather than the French,&quot; is not a sentiment which findsan echo in places like the Kilani haram. It is true that the fervent Baghdadi isequally prepared to set his own province alight, but that does not convince theDamascenes of his political devotion. They observe, not without some justice, that/the baghdad is who are with Faisal are not men of wealth and position in Meso-potamia, while the greater number have been absent from their own province since they reached manhood and cannot be expected to have local interests at heart.Members of some of the leading families of Damascus, &apos;Ayyubi or Mu&apos;ayad, refuseto believe that such a disaster as a massacre of the Christians a thing which they themselves have never witnessed is possible under modern conditions, but they ownto another cause for alarm. They fear the Beduin, especially their near neighboursthe Ruwallah, grown more powerful on Hijazi subsidies and encouraged by the per-sonal favours which Faisal dares not withhold from their Shaikhs. Either Nuri or his son Nawwaf are always in Damascus and always have the ear of the Amir, whodepends on them for levies if it comes to war with the French, and meantime pre-serves through them his hold on the desert. When our troops leave Syria theDamascenes fear that the desert will overflow its borders and come looting into -thetown. Anarchy will break loose, for no one looks on the Arab garrison as a safe-guard. Even now the Damascenes say that Beduin marauders are treated with far too much leniency. &apos;Abdul Rahman Pasha Yusuf, the richest man in the town,complains bitterly that his outlying flocks are not safe from their camels and that hecan get no redress.
I had an interesting talk with a friend of many years&apos; standing, Dr. &apos; AbdulEahman Shahbandar. Educated at the American College at Beyrut, he has alwaysbeen a convinced adherent of the Young Arab Party and is now an ardent Nation-alist, but even he admitted that the Baghdadi and Palestinian group were indifferent to the true welfare of the country and that their expenditure was so extravagantthat it must lead to ruin. He maintained that there were plenty of Syrians betterqualified to hold office than the present incumbents, and instanced Rushdi al Safadi,Kamil Qassab, Khalid al Hakim and Hashim al &apos;Atasi, the two last of Horns. I sawRushdi Bey at Aleppo, where he commands a division. He is a young man who waseducated in Germany and speaks excellent German. He served in the Turkish armytill the armistice, and having been before the war a member of the Young Arab Party,he stayed on in Constantinople as the representative there of the Arab Governmentand returned to Syria some 4 months ago. In his opinion the Damascenes whoobject to the Baghdadi group are those who covet but do not merit office. KamilQassab and Hashim al &apos;Atasi called on me in Damascus; the former is an &apos;italian with no administrative experience, the latter a capable looking man who was a Qaim-maqam. under the Turks. . Both are violently anti-French and both, like Dr. Shah-bandar, expressed their conviction that a native government, different from thepresent one,.could carry on administration; but not without foreign advice in finan-cial and technical matters. I should judge my friend Dr. Shahbandar to be a wiserman than any of these, the more so because he conceded sorowfully that an Arabgovernment such as he had in mind must at the last resort accept French assistancerather than fall into the bottomless pit to which its unguided steps would lead it.&apos;Abdul Rahman Shahbandar has not given up all hope that America could be induced to accept the mandate, and this was the general delusion among those Syrians whohad definitely made up their mind that we should refuse it if it were offered to us;in the first fortnight of October they were not very numerous. He thought that heand his friends had an untried arrow in their quiver, and he intended to go to theUnited States with two others, one of whom was a Professor at the Beyrut College,and lay the Syrian case before the American nation. I gave him a private letter of introduction to Senator Lodge, together with my blessing both for what they wereworth and after he had left I devoted some moments to considering whether the tourof the American Commissioners last July had not been on the whole the most criminaldeception which had been practised on the Syrians.My Damascene friends were anxious to show me some of the things which theyhad made themselves that phrase of one&apos;s childhood exactly fits my impression oftheir gratification at seeing institutions grow up under their own hands.. I wastherefore invited to inspect the Madrasat Banat al Shuhadah, the School for theDaughters of Martyrs, where orphans are educated whose fathers fell fighting inFaisal&apos;s army. It is run on private subscriptions by a committee of ladies preside over by nazi bint al &apos;Abid, a girl of 21 belonging to one of the best families of damascus. She is a niece of &apos;Izzat Pasha, who was the all-powerful Secretary of&apos; Abdul Hamid for a period of years, during which he earned great wealth and thebitter recriminations of the C.U.P when it came into the saddle. In spite of theirthreats &apos;Izzat managed to escape to Europe, where he had already lodged a respect-able part of his fortune. Sitt nazi was educated in a mission school at Beyrut,speaks English, and is the most advanced lady in Damascus. She and her mothersat unveiled among a company of men, a select company, but none of them related tothe &apos;Abid family. Another Mohammadan lady of the committee was present, and she also was unveiled. The school building was admirably clean and airy, the sani-tary arrangements left nothing to be desired, and the teaching, so far as I could judgefrom listening to a lesson in each class, was cheerful and intelligent. The mistresseswere mostly Christians educated in Beyrut and speaking fairly good English.Besides the orphans there were an equal number of girls of good Damascene familieswho pay for the education they receive. These girls 16 to 18 years old, were not seen by the men of the party. Girls and children were brought out into the large gardenwhich surrounds the house to sing patriotic songs. In one of them a chorus of theelder girls addressed the orphans, reminding each one that her father died in thecause of liberty and bidding her never to forget that she was &quot; bint ul &apos;Arabi,&quot; whilethe children replied that they would never forget their birth, nor King Husain whofought for their race, nor finally (this stanza was specially prepared for the AmericanCommission) President Wilson who laid down save the mark the principles of freedom. -The next show place was not quite so satisfactory.    It was the municipal
museum, which is in process of being installed in the Madrasat Malik al &apos;Adil. Therepairs to the building had not been completed or the exhibits arranged, nor didanyone, not excepting the curator, know anything about them, though they werefamiliar local finds, some of which were of merit. Across the street is the libraryof the Malik al Dhahir, one of the most beautiful monuments in the town. It alsois to form part of the Museum buildings. The pages torn from Kufio Qurans, solerelics of the treasures of the mosque, which were rifled for the German Emperor in1898, were still, as I remembered them before the war, folded across and stuffed intoa corner of one of the bookshelves. But if Mithraic reliefs, Roman glass or Kuficparchments were not receiving the care which a European curator would havelavished on them, the pride and joy of the exhibitors could not have been surpassed.The institution was, as they said-and in more senses than one genuinely Arab.Far more remarkable, to my mind, than any Arab institution was the existenceof the committee of ladies which directed the school. Damascus, up to the time ofthe war, was very backward as regards the position and activities of women, andnothing resembling a philanthropic committee of this kind would have been con-sidered within the bounds of possibility, either by the men or by the women them-selves. Even now the Moslem women of Jerusalem hold that they have advancedfurther along the path of emancipation than their sisters in Damascus. During last winter a society of ladies, under the presidency of the wife of the Mayor, Kadhim alHusaini, and of the Sitt Nasirah Haddad, has organized relief work among the poorin Jerusalem. The Bait Husaini is one of the best families in the town, while theSitt Nasirah is the widow of one of the Khalidis, a family as respectable as theHusainis, and on his death married a well-known barrister. She has been assiduousin paying personal visits to the houses of those who were in need of relief, and herexample had been followed by the daughter of the Mufti. It is a New Jerusalem inwhich well-born ladies visit the poor. The Sitt Nasirah complained of the greatdrawback of not being able to interview men freely if her work required; in thisrespect she was somewhat more restricted than the Sitt nazi. The next genera-tion, she said, would never wear the veil. Although she disclaimed any wish to take part in politics, she had just come from Damascus, where she had presented the AmirFaisal with a small gift, a picture of the Haram, on behalf of the ladies of thesociety. The episode is not without significance, for it shows that Faisal is thenatural recipient of homage in the eyes of Palestinian Arabs, and&apos;also that Moslems,. in respect of their womenfolk, have embarked on the slippery slope which admits ofno halting-place between domesticity and active participation in politics. Thepassage will be rapid, though it will not be completed without a period of greatdiversity. It so happened that the very next woman I saw in Jerusalem after theSitt Nasirah was the wife of one of the notables (the Bait Nashashibi), sister-in-law of an ex-deputy. She had begun a perfectly respectable career as a slave girl in theharam of 5 Abdul Hamid, where she had spent ten years, to which she looked back asthe happiest she had known. It would have been little short of an insult to suggest to her that she should visit a starving peasant, and she would have been overcome byunforgettable self-reproach if a strange man had seen her unveiled. Midwaybetween the two stood the sister of one of my Damascene friends, Izz-ud-DinSarujiyah, who is betrothed to tjhe Sitt nazi. I went to a small luncheon party athis house, to which were invited nazi and one or two men. The sister, a stout lady,well over 35, had never appeared unveiled in company, but after much coaxing shewas persuaded to sit down to table with us, in my honour. Giggling and with manycoy snatches at the discarded veil, she was at length wooed to forgetfulness of heranomalous position by the excellence of the repast. Like an elderly chick emerging all too late, poor soul! from the egg, she chirped in the sunshine of a mixed society.The political atmosphere of Damascus is of such vital importance to Baghdad,until the time when Baghdad takes the place of Damascus as the centre of the arab world, that I make bold to describe further the principal persons whom I met there.At the head of the State, representing his brother Faisal, who was in London, wasthe Amir Zaid. A boy of 21, looking rather younger than his age, he is blest with anengaging diffidence of address. He takes his position with a rather nervous earnest-ness, but when he gets on to terms with his interlocutor he loses the official manner and falls into a humorous appreciation of men and affairs. A conversation on thesubject of a Shammar Shaikh, &apos;Abdul &apos;Aziz ibn Farhan, who with his brothers hasbored the life out of us in Mesopotamia, was very typical of Zaid&apos;s attitude. Hebegan by detailing to me solemnly the exalted attributes of this tedious rogue, andvYitb equal solemnity recommended him to our solicitude.   I replied that I knew him
-only too well and had grown old listening to him, whereupon Zaid burst into sympathetic-thetio laughter and admitted that whenever &apos;Abdul &apos;Aziz came to see him he sentword that he was unfortunately asleep. We dismissed the matter with an easyfeeling that the Syrian and Mesopotamian administrations were not likely to fallout over the sons of Farhan; Sidi Zaid is malleable, much influenced by his surround-ings. I should doubt whether years and experience will give him independence ofcharacter; that is to say, that skilful hands would not find it difficult to keep him in the right path. He has a great capacity for devotion. He is the staunch adorerof his brother Faisal, and expends a good deal of his surplus affections on Mr.Hogarth and Mr. Lawrence. His eager ambition is to go to college at Oxford, where he would be near these two. He is very conscious of his own ignorance and over-burdened by the anxieties of his present position, which he will be glad to resign whenFaisal returns. I should judge him to have a more solid intelligence than Faisal,though faisals wits were sharp enough to enable him to hold his own when he wasbadgered last spring in Paris by the officials of the Quai d&apos;Orsay. Zaid has a fairknowledge of English, but he is shy of speaking it; Faisal knows no languages butTurkish and Arabic. If in the future the Mesopotamian State were to require an arab Amir, Zaid, in preference to &apos; Abdullah, would be a candidate well worth con-sidering. As I saw him in Damascus he was good material for the psychologist.More Turk than Arab in appearance and possibly in mind it was not for nothingthat he was born of a Turkish mother he has been caught up by Faisal&apos;s ardentspirit and shares his patriotic ideals; surrounded by staff officers, mostly baghdad is,whose common link of experience with this Arab Prince is a Turkish training; witha sharply contracting background of tall negro eunuchs from the Hijaz palaces, theonly Hijazis now in Syria, except for his own family; conscious that the next fewweeks may decide the fate of a nation, an infinitesimal nation, it is true, but, beinghis own, it fills the prospect; and young enough to be half afraid, yet glad, to inter-rupt official business with a laugh, and half ashamed to recognise how much relievedhe would be to exchange his very grave cares and his very simple military state forthe irresponsible amusements and the unparaded comfort of the Oxford under-graduate.Yasin Pasha comes next, for he is second only to Faisal in significance. HisTurkish training has stamped him Turkish, the military. Teutonized Turk, not theefiendi He speaks moderately good English, but prefers to talk in Arabic. He istrenchant and dogmatic in giving expression to his opinions. He met me at thepoint of the sword, but when he found that I wished to play audience, not adversary,he became rather more expansive and ended by being almost cordial. It was not,however, a genuine cordiality, nor would it be safe to say what aspect or mood of hisis genuine. Wary, aggressive, and alert, he was the most forcible personality Iencountered. He is a self-made man. but he has by no means completed a task whichis also his first preoccupation. There is no room for his ambitions in any Arab pro-vince unless, as would probably meet his views, it were to remain an integral part ofthe Ottoman Empire. If, or when, the Syrian State founders, Yasin will betakehimself elsewhere, carrying his bat. But wherever he goes it will not be to Meso-potamia under a British mandate, nor, with the best will in the world, could we make use of him.Next to Yasin comes Ja&apos;far Pasha al &apos;Askari. He is Governor of Aleppo, but hehappened to be at Damascus while I was there. A Baghdadi, he has about the samesocial status as Yasin; his father was Mukhtar of one of the quarters of the town.He was educated partly in Germany and speaks seven languages fluently Arabic,Turkish, Persian, Kurdish, German, French, and English. He was taken prisonerin the Western Desert of Egypt, and has fought with the Sharif&apos;s Army from a very early stage of the rising. He has run Aleppo since the beginning of March and done it well, though the moving spirit of his administration is said to be Naji Beg Suwaidi.He is a man very little over 30, tall and fat, genial, jovial, excellent company, and asbitterly anti-French as Yasin, to whom in other respects he bears no resemblance.He has the singular merit of honesty. I cannot call to mind any man of his calibrein Mesopotamia, and it is my belief that we ought to be able to find a place for him;but, like all &apos;Iraqis who might come to us from Syria, he would have to be handledwith great tact, for in Aleppo he has had complete independence. As Governor ofa big Mesopotamian district, if such posts were subsequently to be created, he should do well. My impression is that he would be amenable to control if it were exercisedwithout too much show of authority.I did not see Nuri Pasha Sa&apos;id, who, according to report, is on the same level as[1925] &apos; D
Yasin and Ja&apos;far. His father was an accountant of Baghdad. He was in Basrahat the time of the occupation of that town, volunteered for service with the Sharif,and was one of the earliest of his adherents. He is said to be the best of them, a moderate man of considerable ability.   He was in Europe with Faisal.Mahmud Pasha Mukhlus, divisional general, has the reputation of being an excellent soldier, but is without other attainments. He comes of a small Mosulfamily, but his mother was of the&apos; &apos;Ubaid tribe. He was an officer in the Turkisharmy and gave himself up after the battle of Shu&apos;aibah. He arrived in the Hijazimmediately after the rebellion began and boasts that he and Mr. Lawrence werethe first officers of the Sharif&apos;s army. He is about 30. I found him friendly andpleasant, but he is said to be fanatical, and he belongs to the extreme group of theAhd al &apos;Iraqi. He would be difficult to use here, but I had the impression thatit would be worth while to make the attempt, if he would come to us. For he is aman, and the sex is less numerous than is commonly supposed.&apos; Abdullah Dulaimi, another Mosuli of about the same age and social standingas Maulud, is a colonel in the Arab army. He also belongs to the extreme party.He is a great friend of Zaid, but Faisal does not like him and thinks that he hasa bad moral influence over his brother. He has been given permission to visit his family in Mosul and at Zaid&apos;s request I offered to take him with me from Aleppo,but though he expressed great gratitude, he did not join me there.I had several visits from Ibrahim Hilmi, a Baghdadi of 25 or rather younger,editor in Damascus of a paper called &quot; Lisan al &apos;Arab.&quot; His knowledge o  Arabicis so scholarly that Pere Anastase, one of the best judges, tried to induce him toreturn to Baghdad to assist him when he was editing our vernacular paper. He ispro-British, and has published in the Lisan a number of articles favourable to our administration. He discussed the possibility of his paper&apos;s obtaining a circulationwith us and urged that such advocacy as his, coming from Syria and not from theGovernment press in Baghdad, would make an impression. He is probably not without hope that we would ultimately subsidize the Lisan, He hinted that hewould be willing to undertake editorial work in Baghdad if we would offer himhigh enough terms, but his requirements would not be modest. He is however acapable young man.I sent for a former Baghdad acquaintance, Rashid al Hashimi, who left usabruptly last autumn. The reason for his departure, he explained, wasthat one of his brothers was arrested by G.H.Q. on a suspicion, which provedgroundless, of connection with the Turks. Rashid took alarm and made off. Heand another brother, Muhammad, belong to the violently anti-European section ofthe Ahd al &apos;Iraqi. Rashid is a secretary of Yasin&apos;s, and is said to be in the confi-dence of the latter. Some weeks ago, in a public speech, he prophesied that the tigris would run with blood; whose blood was not specified, but since it could onlybe Arab or British, &apos;Ali Ridha Pasha Rikabi judged the phrase to be inexpedientand condemned Rashid to a short term of imprisonment. His.connection with usbegan in 1916,* when he came to us in Basrah as a Nationalist fugitive from theTurks. We made him an allowance till after the fall of Baghdad, in spite of thefact that he had, under pressure from the Turks, written a violently anti-Britisharticle in a Baghdad paper before he fled to Basrah. He subsequently failed toobtain an appointment under the British Administration. Never of stable mind,he appeared to me to have become scarcely responsible.I met other Damascenes who had been fugitives with us in Basrah. Faiz alGhusain, for whom Sir Percy Cox had a great liking, is now practising as anadvocate. He is a reasonable and a moderate man. &apos;Izz-ud-Din al Sarujiyah,who for some months edited the vernacular paper in Basrah, holds a post in theDepartment of Public Instruction in Damascus. He is engaged to the Sitt Naziqal &apos;Abid. The British I.O., Captain Brunton, considers him to be untrustworthy.He was used for intelligence purposes and was found to be intriguing with all parties and furnishing intelligence impartially to all, including the French. i cannot set this information aside, though I should have thought, from what I know of him, that &apos;Izz ud Din could not hope to find sufficient scope under a Frenchregime.    His interests are, however, mainly literary and scholastic.Another Damascene, Muhammad Kurd &apos;Ali, whom I have known for ,a great&apos;number of years as a prominent member of the Young Arab Party and Editor of the&quot;Muqtabas,&quot; a paper which was constantly being suspended, has an unpalatablewar record. He carried on a violent anti-Arab and anti-British campaign in the*&apos; Muqtabas &quot; until the fall of Damascus, when he became as violently anti-Turkish.
It is only fair to bear in mind that he is the sole member of the Young Arab group,of which I knew all the leading men, whom the Turks did not put to death. Hebought his life by his subservience. He is now in the Department of PublicInstruction and his brother Ahmad edits a &apos;&apos; Muqtabas &apos;&apos; which is adorned withunimpeachable Arab sentiments.Muhammad Bassam, familiar before the war to all British travellers as adisinterested friend and counsellor, has made a large fortune partly by smugglinggoods from the Gulf a process which we were never able to prevent and partly by juggling with exchanges, a fertile source of profit. He is now worth half amillion. He is not very well satisfied with the Arab Government, which has ratherunjustifiably demanded from him monies on account of an unfulfilled contract whichhe made with the Turks. He takes no part in politics, and would be content withany administration under which he could add peacefully to his wealth. He is alittle ashamed of the part he played as a blockade runner, and explained that in his view to sell goods at very high prices to the enemy was, if rightly regarded, a friendly act.       sThe Amir Zaid asked me to see Nuri Sha&apos;lan, the Ruwallah Chief, and discuss with him the possibility of a permanent agreement between his tribe, and the&apos;Amarat Zaid urged that it was in the interests both of Syria and Mesopotamiathat the tribes on either side should settle down peacefully, and added that theRuwaliah would gradually relinquish nomad life and raiding if they knew that their government would protect them from their enemies. Nuri complained to me of&apos;Amarat raids, the last, according to him, having been led by Mahrut ibn Fahadabout the end of August. He said that Mahrut had carried off a number of camelsand that these must be returned by Fahad before any definite negotiations couldbe begun. It was unseemly, he observed, that tribes in alliance with the Englishshould be at enmity with one another, and he thought that we should force Fahadto keep the peace. He added that we had no reason for gratitude to Fahad, whohad not done a hand&apos;s turn for us, not even in the simple matter of dislodging&apos;Ajaimi, and he hinted that we had supplied him with money and arms to attack the Ruwallah. I replied that subsidies on our side of the desert fell far short ofthose given by the Arab Government (Nuri gets 2,5002. a month), and that I didnot believe that official intervention could stop raiding until the Beduin turned intocultivators, a period which was still some way off. At which Nuri laughed and said it was about as near as the end of the world, and that if we could do nothingwith Fahad he would organize a combined raid of Ruwallah and Huwaitat whichwould settle the score. The turn of affairs at Jauf may delay this project, and Iunderstand that Fahad &apos;s account of the raids of the last few months bears noresemblance to that of Nuri. If, as I believe, we should maintain a strictunconcern with desert warfare which we are unable to prevent, and desert frontierswhich we cannot delimit, neither should we use desert quarrels to serve our aims in the long run it will not pay, for we shall involve ourselves in responsibilities which it must be our object to avoid. Nuri was right in thinking that Fahad hasnow little hold over the sections of his tribe. Incidentally Jazza&apos;ibn Mijlad ofthe Dahamshah is now in Nuri&apos;s tent, but with few followers.The Beduin have never held so high a position with the Government of Syriaas they hold now. Faisal dare not deprive himself of their support. Hesubsidizes the Ruwallah and the Huwaitat heavily because of their fightingqualities; to the Bani Sakhr he gives nothing, although they hold the first desertstretch of the hay Railway, because he does not think that they will provide him with men. I should say that from the Ruwallah he will get nothing for which he does not pay exorbitantly, and the Huwaitat are too far off to be of much service.Nuri has a life-long experience in the arts of self-protection, the only arts to whichhe has devoted his attention. In these he excels. When the subsidy diminishesNuri&apos;s enthusiasm for the Arab cause will melt aWay. That period at least cannotbe deferred till the end of the world. It will occur when our subsidy to the Sharifis discontinued, i.e., at the beginning of next year.I have already mentioned the Greek Catholic Patriarch, Dimitri Qadhi. In along and confidential talk he spoke very frankly about the French. He has livedfor many years in Paris and speaks French admirably. He said that his own leaningswere towards the French Government, since his community had in the past receivedinnumerable benefits at Its hands, but he greatly blamed the conduct of the Frenchduring the last eleven months, and was unsparing in his criticism of M. Picot, whom he pronounced to be wanting as much in capacity as in tact.
With the recall of Picot and the appointment of General Gouraud the old order should be fundamentally changed; it is regrettable that it should have lasted so long.A year ago practically all the Christians, Orthodox and Catholic, were pro-French,together with 25 per cent, of the Moslems. At present all Moslems and Druzes, and40 per cent, to 45 per cent, of the Christians, are anti-French, the Moslems becauseof the open preference which has been shown to the Christians, the Christiansbecause of the entire absence of orderly administration. The police service isinfamous and so ineffective that the streets of Beyrut are not safe at night; no attempt has been made to deal with questions of land tenure and taxation, nor hasany preliminary study of these matters been undertaken; the Administration ofJustice has been used to subserve political ends, and not infrequently to satisfy theappetites of officers whose private life is a bye word. The Chief Judicial Officerhas recently been deprived of his civil, as apart from his military functions, onaccount of scandals which the French local authorities could not overlook. all available funds have been used for propaganda, which goes far to explain the short-comings of the administration. The arrival of the American Commissioners gave a fresh impetus to political reward and punishment, and their departure was thesignal for reprisals against all who had favoured a mandate other than that ofFrance.A well-known Beyruti Christian of the Orthodox Church told me that at thebeginning the French had very fair cards in their hands, not the worst of thembeing the natural jealousy of Damascus which is felt in Beyrut. Beyrutis have no desire to be ruin by Damascus they consider themselves far more advanced sociallyand economically. An independent Arab State offers them no particular attractions,nevertheless propagandists of the extreme Damascene party are now getting ahearing.I travelled from Beyrut to the Raiyaq junction with some French officers, oneof whom I discovered to be the Arabist, Dr. Mardrus. They all, and Dr. Mardrusmore emphatically than the rest, condemned the policy which had been pursued by france. There was scarcely a French officer in Syria, they said, who did not wishto leave the country and never return to it; they failed to understand what their government was about. Dr. Mardrus observed that if France hoped to make profitout of Syria she would be disappointed the Arabs would see to that.The political colour of Aleppo struck me as being somewhat different from thatof Damascus. There is something of the same tinge of jealousy of the Baghdadgroup in the mind of the local magnates, but at least the Arab Administration,however composed, has done better for Aleppo than for Damascus; to the casualobserver the greater cleanliness of the town is at once evident. The Aleppo districthas had since the beginning of March, when, after the Armenian massacres of the28th February, Ja&apos;far Pasha succeeded the valueless Shukri Pasha al &apos;Ayyubi, thebest administrators whom the Arab Government have produced, Ja&apos;far and NajiSuwaidi. Within the last few weeks the town has been blest with an active andcompetent Mayor, Ihsan Beg al Jabari. Moreover, the Political Officer, ColonelBrayne, who was under the impression that his duty was to give the Arab adminis-tration every assistance in his power, helped the Baladiyah in small but importantdetails, such as inducing the military authorities to lend transport. In the summerhe found that lie was going beyond his terms of reference and desisted.The net result of better government is greater confidence and a solider sense of security, but in Aleppo, as in Damascus, the local population does not contemplateor think possible a native administration without foreign advice. This was theview, for instance, of Mur&apos;ai Pasha al Mallah, Mudir al Quqaf. He belongs to oneof the leading families and is one of the richest men in town. He held variousofficial appointments under the Turks and it was he who was despatched to Dair alZor on behalf of the Arab Government in January of this year. He did not appearto be particularly remarkable intellectually I recognised in him the familiarOttoman official type, and it was not surprising to hear him declare emphaticallythat he would a hundred times rather see the Turks in authority than the French.Ihsan Beg al Jabari spoke very clearly. The settlement which he would prefer and his opinion was echoed by several others, &apos;ulama and ashraf, who werepresent at the Baladiyah would be a nominal Turkish suzerainty over all Arabprovinces, combined with decentralized Arab administration under British protec-tion. The possibility of the return of the Turks under Mustafa Kamal is more frequently in the minds of Aleppines than of Damascenes, owing to his greaterproximity. It would probably be welcomed by Moslems, but whether it would not be
followed by a recrudescence of fanaticism would seem doubtful. Nevertheless, andin spite of the example of the 28th February, the Christians do not feel anxiety, andArmenian refugees who have got work in Aleppo are indignant at being repatriated.Ihsan Beg is a man under 30 belonging to a large and important Aleppinefamily of Albanian origin. His blue eyes betray his descent. He remained in constantinople for several months after the armistice. The talk at the Baladiyahwas concerned almost entirely with the prospect of a French mandate and the futureof the independent Arab Government. The question most anxiously debated was whether under a French mandate free access to the port of Alexandretta will begranted Damascenes are correspondingly anxious as regards Beyrut. Ihsan Begenquired under what control the Baghdad railway, when it was completed, would fall. He feared that there would be a section of the line in French hands betweenthe western frontier of Mesopotamia and the eastern frontier of Syria, Like allNationalists, Baghdadi or Syrian, he insisted on the paramount importance ofuninterrupted relations between the two Arab provinces. All Nationalists regard the splitting up of Syria into three zones the British mandate in Palestine, theFrench on the coast, and the Arab Government in the interior as disastrous, but none would consent to a French mandate for the whole. The cutting off of Meso-potamia by placing the province under a British mandate is, in their eyes, equallyunfortunate; their ideal is to unite the two under a single Amir, nor should this berelegated to any very distant future. Ihsan Beg declared that the Turks and theArabs had come off worse than anyone in the war by reason of the division of their countries, and he added that the Arabs were more to be pitied since they had been drawn in against their will.  Ihsan Beg speaks fairly good German.I spent an hour with another very wealthy Aleppine, Fuad Bey al &apos;Adli. his political views were not of great interest, being highly coloured by a personalgrievance. He is hostile to the Arab administration because he is being turned outof certain Waqf lands, wrongfully seized by him during the war. A national, no less than a foreign government does not acquire unmitigated merit by acts ofjustice.The famous &apos;italian, the Shaikh al Zarkah, on whom I called, expressed hisindignation at our having given the Arabs so little help. Our obligations towardsthe French in this respect weighed for nothing with him, nor do they weigh withany Syrian. The Shaikh al Zarkah, now an extremely old man, has been treated with great consideration by Faisal, who holds his reputation in high esteem. Hewas the first Qadhi after the occupation, but quarrelled with Shukri &apos;Ayyubi andresigned.I saw too Rauf Bey, Commandant of Gendarmerie, who is a Baghdadi of aKubaisah family. He came with other Baghdadi officers, and the talk was toogeneral to be interesting. Captain Sir R. Paul, who has been lent to the ArabGovernment to organize Gendarmerie and police, speaks well of the former and cannot condemn the latter too strongly. Sir Robin&apos;s immediate superior in Aleppois a pro-Turk, who allows him no hand in executive matters. The head of thedepartment is Haddad Pasha, a Christian, of whom everyone speaks well he wasnot in Damascus when I was there, having accompanied Faisal to London butorders from Damascus are apt to lose efficiency before they reach Aleppo.With Naji Beg Suwaidi I had long conversations. He explained his reasonsfor resigning the post of Mayor of Baghdad, which he held for a few days in July.He said that he had been treated with great courtesy by those in authority, but thathe had perceived at once that the time had not arrived when he could profitably to himself or to us work under the Mesopotamian administration. As long as military rule obtained, the government of the country must be out of focus. He hadtaken advantage of the postponement of his scheme for an elective municipality tooffer his resignation, but his underlying feeling was a conviction that we could not as yet put real responsibility into native hands, and without it he would not hold office.&quot;When Civil Administration was instituted he would be delighted to come back ifwe desired, and he expressed a fervent hope that Sir Percy Cox would be in charge.He did not mention that his wish to meet the American Commissioners had anything to do with his resignation; it is however the general impression in Baghdad thatthis was its primary cause a specific instance of the disturbing hopes which theCommission aroused.It was also a misrepresentation of facts to describe his scheme as having been postponed. A Committee to consider his proposals had been sanctioned by the civil commissioner, although these proposals were drawn up after a very inadequatestudy of the subject.   Naji left Baghdad before the Committee had had time to
meet. Naji Beg assured me that all classes in the &apos;Iraq are now against us. I am not now concerned with the truth or falsehood of this view, but merely with the factthat it is held in Syria, and has created there a feeling unfriendly to us. Naji is strongly in favour of an Amir of the Sharifian House for Mesopotamia and lookson &apos;Abdullah as the obvious selection. He thinks some form of elective assemblyessential and dismisses Yasin&apos;s objections to it on the ground that Yasin hasscarcely any acquaintance with the &apos;Iraq. His own suggestion would be an assemblycomposed partly of elective native members and partly of British advisers appointedby us. The idea does not commend itself as a general proposition but I do not knowhow Naji Beg would work it out in detail. The object at which he would aim inconstructing a Civil Government was that it should always be the native official whodealt directly with the native and for the present, always the British official who hadttie final control, and though I am fully aware that in fact the native, when it is aquestion of official business, prefers to deal direct with the Englishman, nevertheless it is difficult to see how an indigenous Government can be set up except on the lines indicated by Naji. He is pleasant and outgoing, a good talker, with, excellentmanners. He hasthe confidence of the British Political Officers in Aleppo who have seen his work. They say that he and Ihsan are by far the most capable and hard-working men in the district, and that if Ja&apos;far&apos;s administration has been more successful than any other it is because he has had Naji behind him. Naji Beg neverspares himself, is at his office morning, noon, and night, and shirks no expenditure ofpains.Before I left Aleppo, I had a long talk with Dr. Altounyan, whom I knew fromof old. He is an Armenian doctor of considerable reputation who owns a smallhospital besides having a large private practice. He remained in Aleppo duringthe war,, and did useful medical work for the Turks. He laid before me the armenian programme for the future of their race. He regarded it as representing a simple piece of justice and has no doubts as to the possibility of carrying it out.He looks forward to the provision of a national home for Armenians which may or may not cover all the wiiayats in which Armenians are, or were, to be found. Asa beginning, the district from Cilicia to Sivas would be sufficient, and over thisrestricted area he hopes that France wll be induced to take the mandate if Americarefuses. Already expectation that the U.S.A. will be responsible for the welfare of the whole of the Armenian wilayets is fading. In the republic of Van he thinksit is our duty to leave British troops, or if we cannot do that, to supply the localArmenian population with plentiful ammunition. He did not seem to have anyrecent information from Van. If the French take the mandate up to Sivas theymust send troops into the country, but in any part of Armenia which may fall undera, foreign mandate he believes that foreign troops would be needed only for the firstyears, after which time Armenians would be ready to defend their own rights and preserve order. He reckons that 2,000,000 Armenians now in South Russia and the balkans, or refugees elsewhere, would return the moment a foreign mandate isarranged. These immigrants would alter the balance of population and put thoArmenians in the majority. The government must be entirely in their hands; forthe first decade no Moslem must be allowed office. Armenian must be the officiallanguage and if subsequently Kurds or others are permitted to hold office they mustlearn that tongue. The standard of education is much higher among Armeniansthan among Kurds, thanks to the instruction which almost all Armenians havereceived at Mission schools; they are therefore more fitted already to take charge ofthe Administration. If neither France nor the U.S.A. will accept themandate, he would be content with any Christian Power, however feeble Italy orGreece rather than the Turks. The one thing that is excluded is that Armeniashould be placed again under the Ottoman. He laid stress on the point that north of Diyarbakr the Kurds are mostly Qizil Bash, not Moslems, and that they have always shown themselves friendly to Armenians. If there must be a Kurdish Pro-vince, let it be a strip from east of Urfah running south of Diyarbakr. He said alsothat local Armenians felt very bitterly that we have not fulfilled our obligations towards them since the occupation. Refugees who are repatriated to &apos;Aintab orMar&apos;ash find that all their possessions are in the hands of the Turks, and are given ,no help towards getting them back. Nor have any steps been taken to punish thosewho were chiefly responsible for the massacres, though this point formed a provision in the treaty. - It is interesting, but not encouraging, to compare Dr. Altmrnyan&apos;programme with the reports of Major Noel.I have attempted to give a picture of the Syria which I saw in 1919. No doubtit is a very summary outline, for one cannot see much in a fortnight, but I had at
least the advantage, of having had a fair acquaintance with the country before thewar. Since 1900, when I was first in Damascus, Arab Nationalist hopes havesprouted and withered more than once. They went through a period of rapid growthafter the Constitution of 1908, followed by a decay almost as rapid. In spite of much talk and a mushroom crop of patriotic organizations and societies no real progress had been made, and I remember hearing from Muhammad Kurd &apos;Ali in May1914 that he despaired of achieving any form of decentralization under the ottoman government. Possibly Syria, if it had been left to itself, would have remainedstationary for decades, but the forcing-house atmosphere of the war, and still more ofthe period since the armistice, is producing a remarkable crop. It is open to doubt whether it springs from seed grain or from dragon&apos;s teeth; if from the latter, veryinadequate provision has been made for the harvest. Rightly or wrongly, I came toa sharply defined conclusion that the chapter of Arab history which comprises the last twelve months is not one in which we figure with credit. The initial mistake forwhich we were responsible I will not waste words in observing that my judgmentmay be in error was the setting up of an Arab Government in Damascus, with theaccessory corollary of French administration in Beyrut and Adana. The french would now be in a much better position if the provinces which were placed under their direction had not had a year&apos;s experience of the misrule they have applied tothem. An inadequate British military administration, which is all that we could have supplied, far from winning the native population towards us, would haveinclined them to a French, mandate. The Arabs themselves would have been lessdifficult to handle. A year of irresponsible authority has not benefited the countrynor made it easy for those who have been in powrer to accept such control as many ofthem recognize that they need. Here the Arab Government is not entirely to blame.Faisal has repeatedly asked Lord Allenby for advisers, and Lord Allenby lias as often been obliged to refuse on account of our agreement with the French. If we have held to the letter of our contract in this matter, in other respects the French have justgrievances against us. The vigorous anti-French propaganda carried on by the ArabGovernment has been paid for by the subsidy which we are still giving to KingHusain; it is no justification in French eyes that the anti-British propaganda inMesopotamia has been supported by the same funds. Until recently we were sellingsurplus arms to the Arab State, and in early October we were still selling equipment;the French are right in thinking that arms and equipment have been acquired for use against themselves. Still greater is the blame which attaches to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for not having made it clear to the Arabs from the first that we wereabsolutely debarred by our engagements with France from accepting a Syrianmandate. I can testify that in March, when I had frequent conversations withFaisal in Paris, he had had no official information on this head. It was not conveyed to him until July, and he expressed the greatest consternation on receiving it. TheAmerican Commission did nothing, and could do nothing, but encourage vain hopes.The result has been a disastrous prolongation of unrest and intrigue on the part bothof the Arabs and of the French, and increased bitterness on either side. It is alsodeeply to be regretted that our officers in Syria were left in doubt of the ultimateintentions of the British Government. It was not until the summer that they received definite instructions. In May Colonel Cornwallis and Colonel Brayne,independently reviewing the situation, assumed the acceptance of the mandate by ourselves as a possibility. With whatever sincerity they and those under them mayhave played the game of temporary neutrality, it was inevitable that their attitude tothe Arab administration should have been influenced by the uncertainty, which theyshared with the Arabs, as to what the final status of the country could be. All uncer-tainty helped to strengthen Arab hopes.The oysters have been eaten and put down in the bill; it is useless to speculateby whom and in what proportions the bill will be met. A more profitable line of thought lies in the direction of considering how the twelve-month existence even ifit fail to exist longer of an independent Arab State has affected and will affectMesopotamia. It is true that the Arab administration has left much to be desired,and equally true that it has been, artificially financed by our subsidy to the Sharif; butit has presented, nevertheless, the outward appearance of a national Government;public business has been kept going, tramways have run, streets have been lighted,people have bought and sold, and a, normal world has been maintained. british officers in Aleppo consider that Ja&apos;far, Naji, and Ihsan have run a very creditableadministration, and their opinion cannot be set aside. Whether it could have goneon indefinitely or not, for a year it has actually gone on, and if it crumbles under
the present arrangements its failure will be attributed, not to inherent defects, butto British indifference and French ambition. When we set up civil administration in this country, the fact that a responsible native Government existed for a year in syria will not be forgotten by Mesopotamian Nationalists, and if we seek to make useof those Iraqis who have done best in Syria, they will claim great liberty of action and they will expect to be treated as equals. Moreover, the example of India and ofEgypt will be before the eyes of the Arabs of Mesopotamia. In both countries it is safe to predict that the advance towards responsible native government will be rapid,and it will be the more noticeable because it will be accompanied by a correspondingwithdrawal on our part from the position of authority which we have occupied&apos;hitherto, a movement almost impossible to effect with perfect preservation of dignity.I was deeply permeated, during the week I spent in Egypt in September, by a sense of the unpalatableness of the task which, lies before us, and I. regard that country asan object-lesson to us in Mesopotamia. Looked at purely from our point of view, itseems to me to be preferable to take up from the first a position from which we shallnot be called upon to&apos;retreat. An advisory power to which the native administrationcomes of its own free will, and urged by its own necessities, is on safer ground thanone which is forcing guidance and instruction on reluctant subordinates.We have stated that it is our intention to assist and establish in Syria and inMesopotamia indigenous governments and administrations. As regards Syria the promise has now materialized, but if it had not yet taken form I believe that the events of the past year in Syria and Egypt have left us no choice with regard to mesopotamia. Local conditions, the vast potential wealth of the country, the tribalcharacter of its rural population, the lack of material from which to draw officialpersonnel will make the problem harder to solve here than elsewhere. I venture tothink that the answer to such objections is that any alternative line of action would create problems the solution of which we are learning to be harder still.G.L. B.November 15,1919.
