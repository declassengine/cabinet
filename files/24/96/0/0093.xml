A 33 /4Military Secret. 1265^       ) cojFrom Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,.......     ^ &amp;J) &apos; I6t/i january?-?/ 1920.Gii^^ (Received 20th.)568. 15th January. Continuation of our telegram of the 7th instant, 189. Inaddition to aeroplanes or possibly in lieu of them we strongly urge provision of armoured cars for Malleson&apos;s force. Rolls Royce cars alone would be suitable andthey could move from rail head under their own power between April and December.. Essential that spare cars should be provided and suggest organisation in units of fourcars, three with personnel and one spare car.Two such units should suffice in first instance.&apos;We have only 17 effective Rolls Royce cars in India, but owing to shortage of personnel we can with difficulty man only nine cars. These are in constant use onthe frontier and cannot be spared.We hope therefore that you can arrange to send out some cars with personnel and requisite repair unit.,  &quot;If experiments with tanks prove successful we may send them up in which,case we would probably ask you to replace them.
