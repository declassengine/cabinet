CONFIDENTIAL.^gL^^p^v I&apos;1&apos;3 D^cument is the Property or JVl\      ili. Jli^^nJP-M^J^sty^s government cp.   40^      JgjJ prom Viceroy, bth January 1920.ij^y--(Received 6th, J0 a.m.) 29^^ssJ-^^ S.   My immediately preceding telegram.   Afghanistan,   Following issummary of suggested letter to Amir:-&quot; Request for cessation of hostilities against our tribes seems to show that AllAhmad has not explained to him purport of Grant&apos;s statement at Rawalpindi that wecannot allow any.suggestion regarding the management of our tribes with whom wemust deal in our own way, and at our own time, and that discussion of any minor -frontier readjustments desired must be postponed until time arrives lor negotiation of friendship treaty. Tribes of Waziristan have persisted in rebellious conduct and present operations will continue until they have received punishment and givenguarantees. Letter then recapitulates detailed stipulations made by Grant regardingAfghan conduct of foreign relations, dismissal of hostile foreigners, &amp;c, duringprobationary period, and asks Amir to reflect whether he has taken steps to carry outstipulations:-(I) Foreign relations. Amir knows bitter hostility of Bolsheviks notonly towards British Government, but towards all forms of civilised government in asia or Europe. Result is that no civilised country will admit Bolshevik repre-sentatives. Yet first use Afghanistan makes of freedom of foreign relations is to admit Bolshevik missions and to send missions to Bolsheviks. Afghan mission to moscow hate proclaimed admiration for Bolsheviks and hatred for British. AfghanConsul-Gen era! at Tashkend has published violent&apos; anti-British articles. Bolsheviksconstantly proclaim their main object and condition of their friendship is hostility to -Britain, and that they are assembling in Central Asia trained agitators to proceed . -through Afghanistan to make , trouble in India. I will not dilate on hatred ofBolsheviks for all religion and order which must make allegiance with them fatal to interest of Islam, but must, ask Ainir whether open and demonstrative friendship of afghanistan for them does not make it very difficult for Great Britain to believe thatAfghanistan sincerely desires her friendship.&quot;(2) Indian seditionists  have uew-been expelled from Afghanistan,  e.g.,    /Obeidulla.&quot; (3) Afghan intrigues with tribes have continued witness presence and activityShah Daula at Wano. We hoped at first, owing to statement of Afghan Envoy, thatShah Daula was not acting with consent of Afghan Government. But since thenrations and money have twice been sent him from Afghanistan, which seems sign thathe receives official Afghan support. Amir himself is reported to have received andinterviewed large number of our tribesmen at Kabul, to have praised and rewarded-them for having fought against us, and to have distributed medals which they haveworn in presence of our own officers. Border filled with reports that peace treaty wasonly six months&apos; truce,&apos; at the end of which Amir would demand British retirementto Indus. After this review letter continues: I am confident Amir will admit thathe has not fully carried out proviso in Article IV., and that it has become difficult forBritish Government at present to contemplate renewed negotiations for permanenttreaty of friendship. At the same time&apos; I feel since Rawalpindi negotiationscessation of intercourse on basis of established friendship, together with course ofevents in world, may have given rise to misunderstandings on both sides. If thereare any such misunderstandings I am sure Amir will share with me desire to removethem so that way may be cleared for later negotiations and permanently friendlyagreement. I have come to conclusion that best hope of discovering any misurider-standing which may exist and clear them away lies in full and frank discussion by-word of mouth. Obviously preferable that such discussion proceeds between Amirand myself direct, and it would give me the greatest pleasure, if this coursecommended itself to Amir, to receive him at some place in India near the frontier forthe purpose of making his acquaintance and of considering with him relations of our two Governments. But I recognise he may find it difficult to accept invitation Ifhe cannot I woidd suggest as another way of paving the way to friendship that heshould depute Mali mud Tarzi to visit India to discuss with my Foreign Secretarypreliminaries of understanding. . For as he is, under Amir, director of Afghanforeign policy, it seems essential that he should himself be present at such a discussion so as to avoid possibility of subsequent misinterpretation. Discussionsuch as I have suggested would not, have as its aim the immediate conclusion of adefinite treaty of friendship, for which conditions, as I have pointed out, have not yetbeen fulfilled, but would be designedly merely for the purpose of frankly examiningany obstacle which may now exist to a good understanding, and to prepare a firmfoundation on which a treaty of friendship can be erected at later date. I trust Amir^ will consider this suggestion in the same friendly spirit in which it (? group omitted),and will understand that I have no other object than advantage of both ourGovernments.&quot; .
