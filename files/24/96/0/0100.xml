IK 113 fflCUMENT IS THE PHOggBTY OP HIS BR1T ANN IC MATE ST V&apos; S CrQTON^NT..,)ti    S E ORE T., CABINET,c. p., 5QQ.&quot;IKrtJSTBIAL IsISTtJRBANCES n.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, and Fisheries.The Cabinet Papers (CP.. 472, 475, 490 and.49l)Circulated by the Secretary of State for War, the Minister ofTransport; and the Home Secretary respectively, reveal a state ofaffairs which,, unless promptly remedied (or unless we may assuraethere, is no risk whatever of another great strike), may not onlyinvolve the Government in ruin but bring down with it the wholefabric of society,    There can.be no duty, national or inter-national,, which is more pressing than the maintenance of theinternal stability of the United Kingdom, and yet we appear to bedrifting, with our eyes open, into a possible disaster, in afew weeks * time, without making any serious effort to organiseagainst it.,--   The matter has been referred to, in a desultoryfashion, at- one or two Cabinet Meetings since the railway strike, but, beyond reminding the Cabinet of the existence ofa &quot;Strike Committee,&quot;   which seldom meets owing to the other pre**occupations of its members, nothing appears to have been done tomeet the approaching menace.    Whilst our b&amp;et brains andenergies have bean concentrated upon such admittedly importantproblems as the future of Fiume, Constantinople arid Azerbaijan,the revolutionaries in this country have been pushing tholrpropaganda, unhindered and unanswered, and perfecting their arrangements for a trial of strength in March or April,   It istrue that threatened men live long, and that the mountain in labour may produce a ridiculous mouse, but it appears to beeaually true that if there should be an upheaval - even on a scale no greater than the Railv/ay Strike last Autumn - neitherthe Military nor the Civil Authorities   vcould be in a position tograpple with it..    Nothing could be mere definite or disquieting
than the warnings of the War Of fine, Air Ministry, Transport&apos;Ul&apos;&apos;Ministry, and Home Office, with regard to their presentimpotenoe, and, without imputing blame to anyone aonoeroed, thonet result appears to be that we are drifting to what may be a supreme crisis in a spirit of almsst Oriental fatalism,The only constructive proposal, submitted to tho cabinet is that of Sir Eiward Troup (c.P. 490),&apos;. for, the enlistment ofa temporary volunteer force of 10,000 men.    This does not carry conviction as being either adequate or very practicable,but 1 trust that it, and all possible alternatives, may be examined by the Cabinet at the very earliest opportunity.I also venture to suggest that the last Report of the&quot;Directorate of Intelligence&quot; (CP* 491) indicates the vitalimportance and urgency of counter-revolutionary propaganda onthe largest and moat vigorous scale that can be organised bythe Government,    So far, we appear to be merely ignoring thepoison whioh is being distilled in our midst, and leaving the masses at its mercy without providing any antidoteX cannot too Strongly support the plea of the Secretaryof State for War and the Minister of Transport that this wholequestion should be taken up by the Cabinet, as a matter of great,urgency, without a moment&apos;s further delay.(Xntd.)      L of P.26.1.20,
