Museum, to . theeffect that Edinburgh Castle should.be.utilised for the. purposesof a national War Memorial for Scotland,.&apos; due. regard/being had tothe general interests .tff the Imperial. War Museum, and to theauthority of the Jlrst commissioner.-c&apos;f.&apos;-Works,&apos; cyer&apos;,the Castle aean historical and architectural monument. &apos;l,,:was. authorieed totake such steps as i considered desirable &quot;for announcing thedecision of the cabinet, for discussing the best methods ofenlisting Scottish interest and support, for colTecting..exhibitsand relics, and for formulating a general policy to ,deal,with theCastle buildings in conjunction with the/First commissioner of. Works*.jxi accordance with the above decision I appointed a committee with the Duke of Athoii,&apos; to.whom the&apos;inception of the scheme was mainly due, aa chairman.   Tfre Committee reported in July,.. 1919,with specific recommendations to. the effect that no surroundingmore worthy than the Castle could be found for. a National..; Memo rialto Scotsmen killed in the.:war;   that the actual Memorial-shouldtake the ftxra of a dedicated bullding/or shri&amp;-e.-.&apos;.e.reoted ..on theapex of t&amp;e Castle rock-;   that. th.e names of-the.; ^11 en should be recorded In a permanent manner, .if not.within- the&apos;-shrine at l$astin an adjacent building; and -that ,.i?oom,, ehpul d be found.adjoiningthe shrine for memorials to Scottish divisions or. brigades orspecially distinguished Scotsmen, who, had.... given their lives in-thewar. . The Committee further recommended that if the Castle were&quot;devoted to the purpose proposed,,, existing buildings,,within itsarea should &quot;be adapted to prcyi.de aecommodation. fpr housing therelics and trophies of Scottish regiments ,and. o.ther-hietoricalfellca of special value to the nation; and that the barracks onthe castle site, now superseded by tfte new-barracks at Bedford&apos;v^hould\\e. adapted to house.and develop the collection of the 1&quot;Scottish national Museum of Antiquities. -They annexed a reportby sir Robert ^primer, the distinguished arch-itoot*   incorporatinga design for the proposed shrine.   They rec emended the scheme as a whole but considered that precedence should be given to suchparts of it as are commemorative.,in character.   Finally, -they\statev what if they are continued-for&apos; the purposes of precedingwith the scheme, their Intention is to deal with the whole matter in a spirit of the utmost architectural restraint and reverencefor historical traditions.The Committee estimated that for the -/whole scheme a sumef  250,000 or if the State,were to contribute the. 65,000 requiredfor adaptionsto house the.National Museum of Antiquities a sumof  185,000) would be required.   They felt that if.a strongappeal were made to the public it should not be.difficult to collect this amount.I now lay the matter before the .cabinet with a.request that, aa recommended by the Duke of Atholl, I may receiveauthority to continue the Committee with powers to make an appeal for funds for the purposes enumerated in the Report, but primarily for. the purpose of the central shrine..
It i3 probably unnecessary to&apos;commit the Government atpresent to mere than a general &quot;approval of the architectural andether proposals in the Report, or at this moment to promise any government contribution to the housing of the National Mu3euu&amp;. ofAntiquities.   I should add that the Office of Works has been and.will be kept in touch with the proceedings) and reference willbe made to that Department in all architectural matters.As the matter is pressing, I fequest the favour of anearly decisi on..(Initialled)   R.M. -13th January.,,,,192.0.
