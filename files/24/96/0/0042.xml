JQl!gJ^&quot;mgnt is the PrCDertyj^HtgBrttannij MaJestVa ^^ment1252rom Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,4th January 1920.&apos; (Received 10th.)71. 4th January. Malleson wires 1st January, repeating Teheran : &quot; Pan-Islampropaganda. During many months I have made careful and detailed enquiries in whole area to which I have access. I am convinced that in spite of efforts of KazimBeg and others there is not the slightest enthusiasm for the Khalifa or for Turkey.None of inhabitants of Central Asia would be willing to risk their skins on their behalf. Western Afghanistan is equally apathetic, and Persians regard Turkey ashereditary enemy. Whole agitation so far as this area is concerned is absolutelyhollow, and the loud beating of Pan-Islamic drum is so much sound and fury,signifying nothing. All my information goes to show that if Turks are turned outof Constantinople news would leave Central Asia cold. Whole business, in this area at any rate, is purely political agitation run by Jews and infidels in interests ofBolshevics and Young Turks and with no flavour of real religious feeling about it.Moreover, agitation has fallen singularly flat. It probably has not produced a singlerecruit.&quot;
