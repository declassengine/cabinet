With regard to questions affecting the transfer of labour^to and from agricultural employment, the administration of thetemporary out-of-work donation scheme and of the contemplatedpermanent unemployment insurance scheme, in so far as these schemes affect agricultural labour, it, was agreed that the respon-sibility for such work should rest, as  hitherto, with theMinistry of Labour acting through the national system of Emoloy-raent exchanges.   It is desirable that further special arrangements should be made for linking the Employment Exchanges with thelocal agricultural bodies for which the Agricultural departments are responsible, and further consultation is taking place betweenthe Departments with this object. ,3.    With regard to the responsibility for dealing with disputes in which agricultural employers or work-people are involved, theIndustrial Courts Act provides that in any oase in which agri-cultural labour is affected, action taken under the Act by theMinistry of Labour shall be taken in conjunction with the appro-priate Agricultural Department.   There is no reason why theagricultural industry should not, independently of the machinerycontemplated in the Act create any machinery of conciliationwhich the,industry may find convenient.   &quot;When, howr- *r, action is desired under the Industrial Courts Act it will be takenby the Ministry of Labour after full consultation wi&apos;. and inconjunction with the appropriate Agricultural Department, andthis will be made clear in the formal letters of Appointment ofArbitrators and similar documents issued by the Ministry ofLabour.   Applications for the appointment of Arbitrators addressedto the Agricultural Departments will normally be transferred tothe Ministry of Labour for action in accordance with this arrange-ment.4*    The above agreement is accepted by, the Ministry of Labour,the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Board ofAgriculture&apos;for Scotland.
