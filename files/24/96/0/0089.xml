ggJDOOggg^ 0 7C i B IBBI,average  gravity : w&apos;&apos;: mm. S jLS^NiulSlSSi from the Secretary of ihe Brewers1( 3ftg also CP. 456).&apos;The Broweirs* - Society,Queen Anne1 a Chambers,Westminster, 8.W.January 2lst, 1920,The Secretary ofThe Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens,S.W.1.Sir,&quot;Your letter of Deoember 29 wag considered at a meeting of myGeneral Committee held yesterday, when extreme disappointment wa$expressed that our request for an increase in the permittedaverage gravity of beer has so far only been met by your statement that &quot;the Cabinet is at present engaged in the preparation tf ameasure to deal with the whole question of liquor restrictions71.If the measure referred&quot; to is the Bill whioh the Prime Minister,has said is to be introduced &quot;to perpetuate- the powers of theCentral Control Board&quot;, whioh powers do not. necessarily terminateuntil some time in 1921, my Committee would once more press fora more definite decision at the earliest possible data.The position at present ia that brewers in Great Britain arevery seriously handioajppod in the&apos;production of higher gravitybeer, especially&quot;stout, whioh has for very many years formed animportant part of the trade of many of them, particularly *fbrewers in London.    Their hands are moat unfairly tied by cXelimitation of average gravity to 1044 , while Irish brewers;, wboare permitted to brew to an average gravity of 1051*, are thus&apos;given an undue preference and day by day are oapturing this,particular trade from the brewers in Great Britain.My
My Commit;too, as they have      before urged, feel most strongly that tho handioap imposed upon brewers In OreatBritain ought in common Justice to be removed at once, andthat an intimation that the matter is to be dealt with insome measure to be Introduced at some future but unknown datedoes not in any way meet the real grievance.,    $he matter^relatively is one of minor detail whioh, they venture reapeot-fully ta suggest, the Food Controller might be permitted todeal with now so that the concession asked for should be applicable to the present quarter.trusting that the question will onoe more be brought before the Cabinet for Immediate consideration and decision,I am,Yours faithfully,(Signed) P,C, MORGAI.Secretary.
