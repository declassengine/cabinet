January 1920, 2f(^Capacity of the Eoyal Air Force to assist the Civil Power in IndustrialDisturbances.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN connection with the memorandum on the Capacity of the. Army to assist theCivil Power in Industrial Disturbances dated 7th January, .1920; I circulate below amemorandum on the Capacity of the Royal Air Force to assist the Civil Power in industrial Disturbances which has been prepared by the Chief of the Air Staff.. WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.January 19, 1920.Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff.The Air Council desire to associate themselves generally with the view of theArmy Council, set out in the memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staffwhich Was circulated to the Cabinet on the 7th instant.2. The numbers of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom are so small that theirdispersal throughout the country either as volunteer workers in maintaining essential services or in local guards as a preventive measure would throw severe difficulties inthe way of subsequent concentration for the duty which they share with all the armed forces of the Crown, viz., the enforcement of order when the resources of the civil power have failed.3. (i.) The personnel of the Royal Air Force has been reduced from approximately60,000 to 30,000 men since the Railway Strike in September last, and forthis reason alone it would be impossible for the Royal Air Force to givethe same amount of assistance in semi-industrial services if the occasion for such assistance again arises in the near future,(ii.) Employment on work of this kind, which would test severely the steadinessof Regular troops with long-standing tradition and ingrained habits ofobedience, is likely to be gravely injurious to the morale and discipline ofa service which consists at present almost entirely or young anduntrained men.(iii.) Any extensive drain upon Royal Air Force personnel for industrial purposeswould materially affect the capacity of the Royal Air Force to maintaincommunication by air, a service which could be undertaken by them without dislocation of their main duties.4. The Air Council trust therefore that no measures will be adopted which will involve the intervention of the Royal Air Force for maintaining industrial services,except in an emergency threatening the overthrow of the State, until after theresources of civil organisations, both permanent and emergency, have been drawn uponto the fullest possible degree.H. TRENCHARD,Chief of the Air Staff.January 14, 1920.
