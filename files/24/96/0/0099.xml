CONFIDFNTMf   JS!i 2Sffi!2 rtiS J?.?  SE23L2L 549^J^-&apos;&quot;&quot;ll:J:&quot;x\      THE BLOCKADE CF SOVIET RUSSIA.      ffh. L[^jkiiift^0.1?.       *Me^^andum by the Admiralty for the ggg Cabinet.(&quot;lALt.^,^The Supreme Council have decided to re-cpen tradingrelations with the Russian people, but without any change In allied policy towards the Soviet Government.Although this decision does not necessarily imply the raising of the bloelade, Bolshevik W/T messages indicate that theSeviet Government intend to take advantage of the situation topress for this.2.-    It appears from Lcrd Acton&apos;s.telegrams No.756 of 16thDecember and No.9 of 4th January, and from a letter dated 50thDecember from the British Commissioner for the Baltic Provinces(copies attached), that the Bolsheviks are extremely anxious toobtain the removal of the blockade and were prepared at that   timeto make considerable sacrifices in return.5.-    According to the letter above quoted, the followingconcrete proposal was put before the Esthonian delegates at theDorpat Conference by M.Joffe, the Bolshevik delegate:   &quot;If GreatBritain en her part were to guarantee the neutrality of the GulfCf Finland, thenSoviet Russia would be prepared to sink all hernaval forces and to allow a British Commission Into Soviet Russiawith the object cf satisfying themselves that this undertakinghad been completed.&quot;-  M.Joffe also stated that this proposal didnot include the dismantling of the fortresses of Kronstadt orKrasnaya Gorka.4.-    In these circumstances, tho Admiralty are strongly ofopinion that the blockade should not be raised unless the BolshevikGovernment agree to the complete destruction of all their naval forces under the supervision of a British Naval Mission.5.-     If this proposal were made by the Allied   Governments and accepted by the Bolsheviks, the Admiralty would be relieved of theprospect of keeping a considerable!orce in the Baltic next spring.It is known that the Russian naval dockyards are beingworked at high pressure to get their ships ready by the spring; andthe work is probably being carried cut under efficient Germansupervision.A statement is attached, showing the strength and conditionof the Bolshevik naval force which are expected to be available for&apos;service in the Baltic next spring.   It would be necessary to maintain a British force at least equal tothese forces, to deal with themsatisfactorily.6.-    In order to maintain this force in the face of mtdern formsof attack from sea and air, a secure base In the Baltic is essential;and if Esthonian and Finnish ports are closed to our ships, asseems to be probable, it will be extremely difficult to find a base.7.-    Although there is every indication that the attitude of theBolshevik Government will stiffen considerably in v) ew of their recent successes, their most urgent present need is still the raising of the blockade for the purpose of reconstruction,* and the Admiraltyconsider it most advisable that the destruction of the Bolsheviknaval forces should be demanded before any steps are taken to giveeffect to the recent decision of the Supreme Council/.(Intlld.)

Secret.dy tele^r^n ilo* 751 par^,;-raph 3*It h-^s been confidentially su^ested to me froma British official source which I am not at present at liberty to quote that it might be possible   in exchange for release for Petro. rad or the foodstuffs lyinr- at Viborgand amounting I believe to some 30*000 tons that bolshevikswouL\ be willing to destroy their remaining n&amp;vul units.I need hardly point out $litthat would be rainedfrom the point of view of the naval situation in the Balticif the menace which could become actual next sprinp, of the activity on the part of the Bolshevik ships of war, oould bethus definitely removed.   Although I understand that atthe present moment only --ev^stopol nlfht be in a positionto nut to sea there are sorn^ ten submarine -craft in Fronstadtwhich vith G:erman help this winter could be made availablefor the spring&apos;,Foodstuffs in question at Viborg are property ofthe American Pood Relief Committee; in the event of the abovesu(.; ;estion receiving favourable consideration it would therefore be necessary that some arrangements should be cone to between His Britannic Majesty&apos;s and United states Governmentsby which we should take over stores as soviet would certainlyderand delivery of the foodstuffs concomitantly with sinking offleet which would have to be controlled by the Senior l^avalOfficer Baltic.I am not in a position to judge that the effect ofthp release of such a lur%:e consignment of foodstuffs mighthave on the military situation on the Bolsheviks or whetherIt -would be possible to arraive for the control of thedistribution in Petrograd. .FlflluiKD..POLITICAL.De cypher from Lord ^oton (Helsingfors) December l6th.Di 4.18 *p ^December 16th, 1919.Ra2.45.pi:-.     &quot;        17th1-TO.i 756 4.
RUSSIA.POLITICAL.Decyphor.   Lord Acton (Holsingfors)*   4th January 1920D. 5.20 p.rn.   4th January 1920R. 10.0 p.m.nV. g.CONFIDENTIAL.British Senior Naval Officer who is now returning to England and who Is author of suggestion made in my telegram756 Informs me that atmosphere of Dorpat conference inducesbelief that Bolshevisms would be ready to destroy fleet in exhange for modification of blockade and admission intoPetrograd of controlled supply of food, locomotives, etc..Admiral considers proposal should be made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to Bolshevik Government that blockade will be released as soon as a commission of British Naval Officersproves that every Russian warship in Kronstadt Petrograd andLake Ladoga has been destroyed.     Time limit for destructionto expire on 1st February without alternative such as Internmentor sale.   In Admiral1s view return of fleet of White russians would be almost as dangerous as their seizure by Germans.Bolsheviks fully realised that fulfilment of bargain as todestruction of vessels In exchange for raising of blockadestands between them and peace.   They would (?be) ready toaccept British direction alone.   I agree with Admiral&apos;s views which he will lay before His Majesty&apos;s Government on his return.Admiral further considers Finland need have noanxiety lest %rcup undecypherable) as to Policy&quot; should escape.(5.1.8-4),
I have the honoufc to be, etc,(sd.)     ..... W.SMYTHIES.Commander R.N.British CommislonNo. 15/14 for tho(167624). Baltic Province.REVAL. 30th December&apos;1919.My L*rd,1,      The peace negotiations at Dorpat between Esthonia and SovietRussia have been advanced a further stop.2.      I am informed that a sitting which took place on December 23rdand agfcin on December 24th, the Soviet delegates exhibited a consider-able change of front.   They agreed to practically all the armisticeproposals put forward by tfre Esthonion delegates and the outstanding points which now remain to be settled would not appear to be verynumerous.  X x x7.      Another point which considerably exercised the minds of theEsthonlan delegates was the question of the naval forces of SovietRussia.       * YuPoska, the senior Estnonian delegate, stated to methat M.Joffe put before him the following concrete proposalIf Great Britain on her part were to guarantee the neutrality of theGulf of Finland, then Soviet Russia would be prepared to sink all hernaval forces and to allow a British Commission into Ssvlet Russiawith the object ofl satisfying themselves that this undertaking hadbeen completed.   M.Joffe also stated that this proposal did not include the dismantling of the fortresses of Kronstadt or KrasnayaGorka.BtMRfska evidently attached considerable importance to thisproposal put forward by M.Joffe and ondeavcured to sound me regardingthe attitude which I considered the British Government wculd adopt towards it.8%      In my reply, whilst giving M.Poska evory assurance that theproposal would be forwarded by me to His Majesty&apos;a Government, I felt obliged to point out that the questions raised by this propositionwere ofl so wide and varied a nature and embraced so many politicalfactors and interests, many of which lay outside Great Britain herself,that I could not feel myself qualified in any way to hazard aprediction as to what decision would ultimately be arrived at., 9.        The ice has now formed in the Gulf of Finland.   For a periodof four months the menace occasioned by the Stviet fleet has, by this factor, been at rest.   When, in the course of ordinary clroumstancesthe ice thaws out this menace will recur anew and, as in the past year, will extend not only to Esthonian but also to other countries whose seamen go down to tho sea in ships.X X X X
