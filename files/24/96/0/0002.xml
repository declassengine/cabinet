From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 5th January 1920.(Received 11.30 p.m.)Clear the line.12 S. Secret. Afghanistan. We have considered in Council situation arisingfrom receipt of Amir&apos;s letter to me of 9th December, reported to you in our telegramof the 22nd December, 1737 S., and your telegram of the 29th December fore-shadowing reply to Amir&apos;s letter to the King subject to King&apos;s approval. As tolatter we fear that if acknowledgment goes from me, Amir, who is - very sensitive,may interpret it as sign that King refuses to regard him as brother Sovereign and torecognise his full independence. Whereas there would not be the same objectionto King not replying at ah or waiting a long time before acknowledgment. Further,assumption that there will in any case be meeting witii Afghan representativesaccording to treaty seems to ignore basis oil attitude which we propose to adopt towards his (? him), namely, that proviso in Article IV. has not been fulfilled, andmeeting for definite negotiations for friendship treaty cannot take place whether atclose of six months period or later (corrupt group) fulfilled. Lastly, reiteration ofreproaches for unprovoked war might revive unprofitable controversy, which has now only academic interest. We advise, therefore, that no reply should go at presenteither to Amir&apos;s letter to the King or to Mahmud Tarzi&apos;s letter to Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs. Afghan envoy has already been informed that both letters havebeen forwarded. Regarding AimYs letter to me and his letter to Grant, 1 amsending ad interim reply to Amir, pointing out that matters of such importance as(2 corrupt groups) must obviously be discussed between him and myself direct, that question has been referred to His Majesty&apos;s Government and reply will be sent assoon as possible. In considering nature of reply, Ave feel that situation has beenradically modified since signing of peace treaty by notable strengthening of Bolshevistsin Central Asia, and evidence received that they have definitely ceded certainterritories to Amir, and that friction between them and Afghans, which seems stillprobable, may take long to mature. Policy of complete indifference wdiich might in former circumstances have been continued with good hope of success might now lead to misunderstanding and to Amir drifting into position of dangeroushostility. While, therefore, it seems still essential to insist that Amir&apos;s failure to fulfil stipulations must postpone definite negotiations for treaty of friendship, wethink it equally essential to regain close touch with him and to create opportunityfor frank discussion of our respective attitudes. Such discussion, which wasdeliberately and rightly staved off in different conditions at Rawalpindi, might, we hope, end in more genuinely friendly attitude and might pave the way for later regularfriendship treaty. If it failed, we should know what to expect, and valuable time would have been gained. Amir and Mahimid Tarzi are both practically unknownquantities, and discussion with lesser lights would fear be infructuous or misleading.We attach great importance therefore to meeting either Amir or Mahmud Tarzi or both face to face. It seems unlikely that Amir would consent to visit India, but hewould probably interpret invitation as sign of friendship, and he might let MahmudTarzi come. In following telegram we forward (? summary) of letter which wesuggest on foregoing basis, if accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.
