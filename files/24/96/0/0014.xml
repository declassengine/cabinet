Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma,jesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1920.*15SECRET.      0[161315]EXPORT PRICES OF BRITISH COAL TO.FRANCE AND ITALY.IN circulating the annexed memorandum from the Italian Embassy, I think it myduty to call the attention of the Cabinet to the serious effect which our present coalexport policy, however good a case can be made for it from the British point of view,is likely to have upon our foreign relations.The French, as well as the Italians, regard our policy with a dismay which is notunintelligible when it is remembered that we are for the moment in the position ofmonopolists who control a commodity which Europe is prepared to buy at almost anyprice. The export price of British coal is not at present a market price in the propersense of the word, since there is no effective competition, and, in practice, foreigners,including our Allies, have to pay whatever price we choose to ask. Rightly or wrongly,our Allies are convinced that His Majesty&apos;s Government, who control the price of coal,are taking advantage of the situation created by the war to profiteer on a vast scale,i.e., to charge a price out of all proportion to the cost. The recent speech of thePresident of the Board of Trade when announcing the reduction of 10s. in the price of household coal here has not tended to dispel this conviction. It is impossible foranyone outside the Coal Controllers office to know the exact position. But the broadfact cannot be disputed that our Allies, while receiving an amount of British coal farbelow their urgent needs, are being made to pay a huge price, which is in effect a subsidy to the British householder and manufacturer. The Italian grievance is evenstronger than the French, since Italy, with no coal of her own and with a worseexchange than the French, has no source of supply except the United Kingdom, while.France, in addition to her own resources, is drawing on Belgium and Germany as wellas on the United Kingdom.In general the danger is that this policy will lead to reprisals, by which we aloneshall be the losers, both politically and commercially. It will be observed that there isa threat of reprisals at the end of the Italian memorandum. Italian import duties maybe raised against British manufactures, and the possibility of reprisals has been mentioned in French Government circles. This would be a serious matter to usfinancially if it were applied, for example, to Algerian phosphates or Sicilian sulphur.A war of economic reprisals might imperil the alliance, and would make the work of theLeague of Nations impossible. The natural trend of our policy on the League ofNations will be towards the open door as against the French policy of exploitingcolonies and mandated areas, and our present coal policy will seriously handicap us inargument on these matters.Moreover, the preservation of close and cordial relations between ourselves andFrance and Italy must depend on the success with which we can help those countries to regain industrial prosperity. From this point of view our present policy hampers usnot merely morally, but materially. It hampers us materially by keeping French andItalian manufacturers, who feel that they may be even further undersold at any moment, in a state of uncertainty and discouragement, and by preventing an improve-ment in the value of the franc and the lira, which is surely more to the advantage ofour export trade than any possible profit on coal. We place ourselves in an ambiguousposition morally, because our action cannot but appear to the French and Italian public to be dictated by the selfish interests of British manufacturers. .For these general reasons I cannot -regard without serious apprehension theembitterment of our foreign relations, which our present policy seems likely, if a loneview be taken, to entail. . &apos;Two particular points of some importance may be mentioned in conclusion : (a.) It is evident that in the near future there will be much friction between theAllies over reparation questions.    On these questions,it is financially
important to ourselves that wo should be in a strong position to resistextravagant French claims. But it is difficult to see how we can do this,without grave danger to Anglo-French and Anglo-Italian relations, if weare at the same time exacting from the French and Italians the highest possible price for our coal.(6.) Under the Peace Treaty (Part VIII, annex 5, clause 6) the Germans are tobe allowed to charge for the coal, which they have to deliver to France andItaly, a price which may be as high as (though it may not be higher than)&quot; the pit-head price of British coal for export.&quot; Consequently the Britishexport price will in fact continue to fix the European price under the peace treaty, and the French and Italians will have to pay as much for german coal as for British coal. It is evident that, if our present policy be adhered to, the above-mentioned clause is pregnant with further potentialities of friction between ourselves and our allies.0. of K.Foreign Office, December 31, 19191. The Italian Government views, with deep anxiety, the rise in the prices ofBritish coal, which now exceed 90s. per ton.The largest proportion of the coal imported into Italy well Over two-thirds-isBritish, and Italy has no means of reducing this cost, either with cheaper imported coalor with home-produced fuel.The jjresent prices have reached a point which constitutes a great obstacle to theeconomic recovery of the country, which is so necessary not only for Italy, but for thewhole of Europe. Such prices also threaten the lite of various industries, especially those which are the largest consumers of coal, the stoppage of which would be highly dangerous to everybody, because increased production provides a means of savingEurope from the present dangerous position. Finally, this rise in the price of coalfurther increases the cost of living in Italy, where it has already reached an almostunbearable limit, and in this unfortunate aspect our country ranks prominent amongstthe countries of the world.2. Such a position is especially regrettable, when it is considered that such prices are the result of the present policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that, accordingto the explanations given by the President of the Board of Trade, in the House ofCommons on the 28th November, 1919, the export price gives enormous profits destined,first of all, to cover the loss sustained on the large proportion of coal used in this country.Therefore, the position is the result of a deliberate policy of discrimination, by which avery wide difference of 50s. per ton exists between the price of coal for internalconsumption and that for export.As a consequence, we are facing a situation which is not only materially unbearable,but also profoundly unjust. The President of the Board Of Trade stated, with absolutetruth, that the rich profits on exported coal are only possible because of the extraordinaryand abnormal condition of the world.The Italian Government were under the impression that it was intended,particularly among the Allies, to co-operate for the relief of such situations to thecommon good. The Italian Government, on their part, have done everything possibletowards such an end. It should not be necessary to recall that, notwithstanding herlimited resources in stocks, finance, and tonnage, Italy has considerably assistedGerman-Austria with food-stuff supplies. The policy of the coal prices can hardly be reconciled with any elementary principle of inter-Allied or international co-operation.3. The Italian Government also see in this situation a further reason for anxietyand danger. The subsidy on the prices of coal for domestic and industrial uses in GreatBritain finally breaks the pre-existing equilibrium in Great Britain on the one side, andin Italy on the other, particularly of those industries which are large consumers ofcoal.In view of this state of affairs only two alternatives are possible both extremelydetrimental at the present moment. One of these is to stop the activity of those industries of which the cost of production, as a consequence of this discriminatingpolicy in prices, exceeds all possibilities of the workfs market, but such coursewould entail an enormous amount of unemployment and social unrest and the loss ofa large amount of capital invested in these industries, and finally, restriction&apos; in industrial production, which is a fundamental necessity, in order to improve theexisting disastrous economic situation in Europe.
The other alternative would be the rearrangement of import duties in Italy insuch a way as to cope with the situation. It is quite clear that this second solution would also entail a large measure of loss and danger.The Italian Government feel it necessary to call the attention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the very heavy responsibility involved in the adoption of either of theabove alternatives if a change in the actual policy in regard to coal prices should befound to be impossible.London, December 12, 1919
