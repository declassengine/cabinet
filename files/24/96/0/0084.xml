Unless this is achieved itis feared that the effect of price changes will be to create a considerable revulsionin public feeling. The success which has attended the policy of supervision in thecase of oils and fats, with its effect on the price of margarine, endorses the belief that relations of a somewhat similar character should be established in other trades, and itis hoped, for instance, that thereby the difficulties which have been and are being experienced in the case of fish may be overcome.Within a reasonable time de-control of Home Agricultural Produce should beachieved, the date of the de-control of home meat being a matter of negotiation,and any measure of control as to the price of potatoes, should such be required, beingobviously temporary. The de-control of imported supplies is being taken in hand,though in the case of two, sugar and butter, control must continue for some time,while action with regard to wheat is bound up with the bread subsidy.But if supervision is to play an effective part in minimising the difficulties inherent in a change of method it must be recognised as a definite function in foodpolicy and provision must be made for carrying it out.General changes during the past month other than those connected with pointstouched on above have been few. Enforcement tends to diminish with the progressof de-control.Total arrivals of the principal foods and feeding stuffs in December were againbelow the level of the preceding month, though still above the average for the year,and the general stocks position remained satisfactory. Net imports of cereals were generally smaller than, in November, but the movements of stocks, though at a lower level than during the critical period of the war, were not abnormal for the season.Meat continued to arrive in large quantities, bringing stocks in store to the recordheight of over 130,000 tons, and after two months of negligible imports a substantialimport of bacon was recorded. Arrivals of butter remained below the ration require-ments and stocks showed a further decrease, as did also those of cheese. Imports of sugar were fully up to the pre-war seasonal rate, but the outstanding feature of themonth was the extraordinary import of tea which represented about 10 weeks&apos; supplyand brought the bonded stocks to a record height of 31 weeks&apos; supply.Supplies of home-grown butcher&apos;s meat in December were marked by a slightseasonal decrease, and total consumption so far shows little tendency to rise above thelevel reached in the last few weeks of rationing. The decrease in the deliveries of flour is normal at the Christmas season. There has been a steady upward movementin the consumption of margarine since the butter ration was reduced, the increase inthe demand being met by the home supplies, which reached 27,500 tons in December.The statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour as on January 1st show a slight increase in the average retail food prices, the percentage increase on July 1914 rising from 134 &quot;3 on December 1st to 135 &quot;9 on January 1st. Comparing the prices withthose of a month ago the differences are small. Tea advanced about per lb.,potatoes about \d. per 7 lbs., and cheese about l\d. per lb. Fish is the only foodwhich has fallen in price, and this only fell 1&apos; 3 per cent. The total weeklyexpenditure on principal foods by the average family for January 1920 exceeds thatof January 1919 by Is. 5-fd.Regarding wholesale prices in December, home-grown cerealsj with the exceptionof barley, show little alteration. Canadian bacon remained at 192s. per cwt., and canadian cheese rose from 144s. Sd. to 150s. lid. per cwt. Sugar, both Englishrefined and granulated, is unaltered. Indian tea fell from Is. 9d. to Is. 1\d. per lb.,and Ceylon tea from Is. Qd. to Is. 5d. per lb. The upward trend of the prices ofoilseeds continued, but the prices of oilseed cake showed a tendency to fall.
