TheCommittee was appointed to consider possible methodsof effecting a saving in the Bread Subsidy.I should add that I am in agreement with the      0*Jconclusions arrived at by the Committee.GEO. H.

BREAD SUBSIDY COMMITTEE.....MO,2.REPORT *The effect of the present system of administra-tlon of the subsidy is that the State subscribesa sum which varies with the rate of foreign ex-changes and at present is approximately 25/- persack of flour (280 lbs,) or about 4d. per 4-lbloaf of bread.    This enables bread to be soldat 9jd and the subsidy also effects a reductionin the price of all flour used for other thanprecluded purposes.Possible methods of effecting a saving In thesubsidy based on two different principles havebeen suggested.-(a) The restriction of the subsidy to bread only and(b) The placing on the market of two differentgrades of flour differently priced.The first basis could be given effect to(i) Either by the issue of subsidised flour tobakers for sale as bread, and to housewives^baking bread at home, or(ii)By the guarantee to every person of a ra-    *tion of subsidised bread or flour.A Scheme on the basis of 3 (i) was considered bythe Committee in Spring last, but the FoodCouncil in April of this year came to the con-clusion that the objections of the Scheme out-weighed any possible advantages.     The SelectCommittee on National Expenditure in their re-port of the 18th July 1919 strongly recommendedhowever, that the Scheme then put forward shouldbe re-considered with a view to its being adopted.As a result of this recommendation the bread subsidy Committee No.2 was appointed in orderto consider again and report upon this Scheme,as well as on the two other Schemes which have since been suggested, based on the principlesindicated in 2 (b) and 3 &apos;(ii) above.The restriction of the subsidy of flour for breadonly could be effected by requiring the millerto sell his flour at the full economic price thesubsidy being paid to the user of the flour.Insofar as concerns flour used for bread by bakersthere would be no insuperable administrative dif-ficulty in paying a rebate to the baker.The number of,bakers however, is very large andwould involve the making of approximately 40,000payments monthly. (Administrative difficulty arising, however, asthe result of the custom, common in certain partsof the country, of making bread at home fromflour bought from retailers,     This Custom is most prevalent in South 7/wales, Lancashire, YorkshireDurham and Netthumperland, but it prevails to someextent almost throughout the country.
In the counties where it is most prevalent tho num--ber of Home bakers is between 30$ and 40$) it is notless than 7$ in any County^ and in London, Home bakersform 9$ of the householders.    Home baking householdsin the country are estimated to number ij millionscorresponding to about 6 million persons,     Itwould not be feasible to limit to certain areas onlythe operation of any special arrangement made to-meetthe case of the home bakers,(7)    To require the home baking housewife to purchase allher flour at the full price of 4/- per stone and to claim a rebate of 1/4 per stone for flour used forbread would be administratively impracticable, andeven if practicable would be extremely unpopular..Machinery must, therefore be devised to enable thehousewife to purchase her flour for baking bread atthe lower rate on production of some document?eri3 for^the (8)    The most complete machinery at the disposal of theXo^tng 63T^ Ministry would be the registration of the general&apos;iZ&quot;&amp;^To&apos;ov public with a baker or flour retailer.     purchases of bread from a baker and of flour from a retailerwould have to be rationed and a Scheme of Supple-mentary rations to meet the case of miners, agriculrtural labourers, and other heavy bread eaters, couldnot. be avoided.   The question arises whether rartionlng of bread at the present juncture for tho pur-pose of effecting an unascertainable reduction inthe bread subsidy would be advisable.(9)     If every registered person were entitled tOj say, 4lbs., of flour (now equivalent to about 5f lbs of bread) per week at the subsidised price, buying inaddition quantities at the full economic price., thiswould involve tho consumption of about 180., 000,000lbs* of subsidised flour per week   (including Ireland)or 82$ of the amount of 220.,000?000 lbs.per week ofthe subsidised flour now used.If supplementary rations to heavy workers were al-lowed an additional consumption of 20, 000.. 000 lbs.and 25.,000.,000 lbs respectively per week, might be involved giving a total consumption of 200*000*000lbs., and 182,500.,000 lbs or 90$ and 83$ respectivelyof the present consumption of subsidised flour*If the ration were fixed at 3j lbs., of flour perweek the consumption of subsidised flour would amount to about 137.5 million lbs per week or 71$of the present consumptions     Assuming that theScheme were absolutely watertight, the possible savring would thus amount to 5 or .10 million pounds only.(10)    If the allowance were too high, very little savingwould be effected, while if it wore too low --therewould be a risk of an outcry from the poorer sectionof the community which subsists largely on bread es-*peclally in periods of unemployments   The necessityof devising some Scheme of supplementary allowance
. for industrial and other heavy workers&apos;seems&apos; unavoidableespecially if a ration of 3?r lbs were fixed.    The difficultyof determining the proper amount of supplementary rationsfor tho different classes of labour which could claim to be,entitled to them is well known.    The experience&quot;derived fromattempts to determine.supplementary rations for meat- and cheeseis not encouraging.-&apos;&apos;--- (11) So long as the machinery at the. disposal&apos; of the &quot;Ministry of food continues, no insurmountable, administrative, difficultycan be urged against the adoption of a scheme of rationing of bread. - - The objections on general grounds however, to a rationing: Scheme for Dread at any time are obvious and the- Committee do not consider&apos;that such a Scheme should be entertained.I of   &apos; (12) If general rationing is. ruled out, we must- fall back on alaration &quot; - declaration&apos;to be made by the home baking housewife to the9meT^*&quot;*&quot; -&apos;. effect -that she bakes ;bread at home.    This declaration could- - be&apos;&quot;made to the Food Committee on a form to be issued by the&quot; -Ministry.     On this form the applicant would give particularsas to her household.     A statement of the number of&apos; persons in;-&apos;&quot;-  the household alone &quot;would not be sufficient,&apos;&apos;it would be essen-tial to require the names of the members constituting the-household so that the information given might be checked-against the&apos; register in the possession of the Committee.     The.&apos; applicant would also have to apply for a definite amount of flour not exceeding the maximum permitted. - Before grantingthe application,- the Committee would make such investigationsas they might consider necessary.    The scrutiny would be more effective if the public were-required to give the informationwithin a given week or fortnight and if during that week or fortnight the general public:could obtain bread from a&apos;bakeronly if.they had deposited a counterfoil - with him and- applicants for home baking&apos;flour were then required to produce the counterfoils-in:support of their declarations.    This -appears&apos;to be the only sound way of ensuring that applicationsare bona fide*(IS) On having been granted the-application, the applicant must be-put in the way of obtaining flour at the reduced price by being given some-document which he could produce or depositwith the retailer.  &apos;-This would be effected by making the formof declaration itself the title to flour at.the reduced price.The form could be printed on ordinary paper, it would bear all information relating to each-householder, -would be dated,would contain the signature of the householder, and the stampof the. Pood Office/ and also the name&apos;of the retailer with whom it had been deposited.1    Having once been lodged with aretailer, it would have &quot;-continuing effect and so long as it remained with the retailer the householder could obtain the-        amount of flour - stated thereon at the reduced price. &apos; - The&apos; - -ration card of each member - of the-household, -would be - stampedby the Pood Committee across the. front page with the
9 3 9(y; U fje* 4**words &quot;Home Baking Flour&quot; or some similar words *The retailer would collect the forms, keep a        ofthe householders, and quantity of flour used per-- :week to which each of them was entitled at the reducedprice and at regular intervals (of at most a month)would forward this claim to the Divisional Accountantthrough the Local Food Control Committee.. &quot;It- shouldhe noted that in addition to the 40*000 bakers re-ferred to above this would involve the checking ofmonthly claims by over&apos; 10,000 flour retailers %    Theright of the public to make a declaration for subsidy-dised flour could be restricted to a given week orfortnight..    Persons who failed to apply within the spe-cified period would lose their right.(14)    Other administrative complications which this method would involve&apos;are those of dealing with:-(a). The prompt cancellation of declarations in respectof persons who have died, emigrated, or of house-holders who have given up baking at home*(b) the transfer of declarations from one retailer toanother of persons who have removed. &apos;(,c) the amending of declaration forms in respeot of births and(d) the adjustment of retailers%. claims in accordancewith these fluctuations. &apos; -(15)    In addition to the above mentioned objections it hasbeen urged that:-(a), there would be a strong temptation to make fraudu-&apos;&quot; lent declarations and the consequent possibilityof any anticipated saving would be materiallyreduced.(fc) there is a possibility of the declarant buyinghis bread from a baker and using the subsidisedflour for other purposes than home-baking.    Itis thought that this type of fraud would be par-ticularly easy in those counties (which form amajority) in whioh home-baking is the exceptionand where the existing bakers&apos; shops would suf*fice to meet the demands of the public-.    Asmuch as 50$ of possible saving on the subsidymight be lost in this way. -  \(c) Considerable difficulty H anticipated in fixing the ration of bread sufficiently low to ensureany substantial saving and at the same time suffi-ciently high to ensure a fair average weekly sup*-ply of bread for the poorer classes of the public.(16)    On the scheme outlined in paragraphs 12 to 15 above theCommittee have no data on which to form any reliableestimate but it is doubtful whether in any case the
saving effected would exceed V or 8 million pounds,The Committee also feels that it would be undesirable to inaugurate any fresh Scheme of registration at the presenttime, unless it is certain that the bread subsidy will becontinued for a considerable time and that the machineryat the disposal of the Ministry of Food will likewise becontinued,   They also feel that the advanced cost of ?.13.those articles which are now so largely used as substitutesfor bread would lead to a general demand for increased wages, I(17)   The Committee have also considered the possibility ofeffooting economise by some simpler method such as permit- ;ting home-bakers to make a declaration to that effect --;whioh would entitle them to obtain any flour they required   Iat the subsidised rate, but they have not found it possible Ito frame any simple scheme that is not open to the doubleobjection that it would operate unfairly as between differ-ent parts of the country where home-baking is not commonand would open the door to fraud among the rest of thepopulation.The Committee is also unable to seo how under any Schemeof this kind the allowance to the retailor in respect of flour alleged to have been sold to home-bakers could be checked in any wayeI(18)   The suggestion of the Select Committee on national expenditure that a saving of 14-J million pounds might beeffected by means of some schemeog differentiation betweenflour used for bread and flour 3$w for other domestic purposes has been fully considered but as paragraph 0 aboveshows the greatest possible saving even under a completesystem of rationing is estimated not to exceed 10 millionpounds and it might fall as low as 5*bone     (19)    We have further considered a Scheme suggested byScheme    Mr* Rathbone, a Member of the Wheat Commission for the placing on the market- of two grades of flour at differentprices..   Mra Rathbone suggests that a coarser flour milledto, say, about 00% should be sold at a subsidised price,and a finer white flour sold at the higher price, andalleges that the purchasing power of the Community is so high that there would be a possibility of practically nosecond grade bread being bought which would result in thewhole of the subsidy being saved.(20)   The scheme involves the sale at a slightly enhanced price&quot;which would yet leave bakers a margin in increases in costs actual and prospective&quot; of Subsidised flour andbread the quality of which must be markedly inferior tothe present quality, while at the^ same time flour andbread of the same or even better quality would be obtalna-ble at a higher price.     Moreover the quality of thesubsidised flour would be
such as to make it quite unsuitable for use in  makingcakes, pastries and puddings and in fact for all domesticusea other than breadmaking, and the housewife would con-sequontly be virtually compelled to purchase either flouror flour confectionery of the uncubsidised quality.   Tothis Committee it appears inevitable that the objectionwould be raised that the State&apos;was providing good breadfor the rich and bad bread,for the poor.(21)   As regards any possible reduction in the amount of subsidyMr. Rathbone?s scheme may appear attractive from the&apos;Treasury1s point of view but this Committee has no dataon which to form any estimate; as the saving to be effectedwould depend entirely on the percentage of unsubsidisedflour used.   In view therefore of the highly problematicaleffects financial and social that would follow the adopt-Ion of any scheme, based on.the principle suggested byMr, Rathbone this Committee is unable to recommend theFood Controller to risk-, such an experiment, &apos;&apos;     &apos;   . .(22)   Various modifications of the principle suggested by:    .Mr. Rathbone have been considered by the Committee, but toall of those there is the paramount objection that in thepublic mind a coarser flour would besupplied to the poorerclasses, and the finer for the richftnat any fraudulentlyminded person oould profiteer to the detriment of the ,consumer by mixing the two grades in such a manner that it -would be impossible with the machinery at the disposal ofthe Ministry to detect the adulteration..,ous     (23)  The original decision of the War Cabinet in August 1917 vjlons of       that the Subsidy should in effect be a subsidy on flouraBlhetwas confirmed on the 20th June, 1919, when although th*&apos;        Chancellor strongly urged that the subsidy should belimited to flour used in the manufacture of bread, the  -Cabinet decided against the proposed restriction.   On the- .28th October last, the Finance Committee of the Cabinetmade a further decision that although the present condi-tions were unfavourable for immediate action, the principleof abolishing the Bread Subsidy should be adopted and assoon as there is substantial improvement in the price offood, it should be removed. ..conclusion (24)   The Committee are unable to,recommend the adoption of any ,;of the schemes examined by them, or; any modification ofthose schemes.It might be possible at some future date substantially toreduce the- subsidy by raising the price of bread and flourgenerally,:If a fall in the price of other foodstuffs:   ..should afford compensation to thr householder, otherwise /any saving on the subsidy would probably be more than -offset by demands for increased wages.We recommend no&apos;change at the present time, &apos;inlstry of Food,Palace Chambers, CHARLES A, MC CURDY.   &apos;5th January, 1920fCHAIRMAN.
