Appreciation of the German forces, 1st January 1920.A. General Organization of the Armed Forces in Germany.The armed forces in Germany can be roughly classified under two headings : (i.) Forces under the Federal Ministry of Defence (Reichswehr Ministry): (a.) The Regular Army (Reichswehr).(b.) The Regular Navy (Reichsmarine).(ii.) Armed forces under the Ministries of the Interior.B. Organization and strength of the Reichswehr.1. Organization and expansion, March to August, 1919. The. Reichswehr was originally formed from the volunteer units, hastily raised by the German Government,with the aid of the old army leaders, to combat the serious Spartacist revolution in(B20/56)   100  1/20  H&amp;s  7861wo
January and February, 1919, subsequently the forces on the Eastern Front(Grenzschutz), consisting of volunteers and undemobilized men of the younger classes,were incorporated in the Reichswehr.The new voluntarily enlisted German Reichswehr was constituted in March, 1919,and by August, 1919, had reached its maximum strength, estimated at approximately500,000.This force was organized in mobile brigades composed of all arms, mainly, based onthe old territorial system of the former German Army, except that all control hadnominally become centralized under the Federal Ministry of Defence. Actually thecontrol over the local commanders by the central authority was often feeble.The former War Ministries of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and Wiirttemberg ceased to exist as such.In August, 1919, the Reichswehr consisted of 43 Brigades. These variedconsiderably in strength, discipline and moral, but a large proportion of the Reichswehrunits have been proved trustworthy in suppressing local, disorders. The value of theforce was depreciated by the continual change of personnel, duetto the short periods ofenlistment.A comprehensive survey of the Reichswehr as constituted in August, 1919, wasgiven in a publication issued by the General Staff, War Office, in September, 1919,entitled &quot;Composition and Distribution of the Provisional Reichswekr in Germany,September, 1919.&quot;2. Reduction and Reorganization, September to December, 1919. (a.) Scheme of Reduction. In August, 1919, a scheme was issued by theReichsivehr Ministry providing for the reduction of the Reichswehr to 200,000 men,in accordance with the Peace Treaty.This scheme was originally to have been carried out by the 30th September, butthe period for its execution was considerably extended, owing to the long delay in the ratification of the Peace Treaty, the unsettled state of Germany, and the desire of theGerman authorities not to increase unemployment.At the same time, a comprehensive scheme for the reduction of the active officers to the numbers required for the provisional army of 200,000, and for the final peacearmy of 100,000, was issued.Certain administrative orders preparing the way for the reduction of the army toits final peace strength have also been published.A full description of the &quot; Proposed German Scheme for the reduction of theGerman Army (Reichswehr) in accordance with the Peace Treaty,&quot; was issued as anannexe to the War Office Confidential Summary of the 7th October, 1919.  .(b.) Progress of reduction. The reduction of the Reichswehr is now in progress,although at a slower rate than originally contemplated, owing to the reasons give above.It is estimated that the present strength of the Reichswehr is about 400,000.This includes troops evacuated from the Baltic States, demobilization staffs of the oldarmy and troops employed in guarding Russian prisoners of war.C. Organization and strength of the land forces of the Reichsmarine(Regular Navy).During the disturbances in Germany early in 1919, three marine brigades were raised and formed into a division under Major-General v. Lettow-Vorbeck.Subsequently these brigades were included in the Reichsmarine Establishment,but remained employed in conjunction with the Reichswehr troops ; v. Lettow-Vorbecksdivision was broken up during the summer.There are at present three independent Marine Brigades, stationed at Hamburg,Berlin and in Upper Silesia. The brigades consist each of four infantry battalions, anassault detachment, three field batteries and technical troops. These brigades are about 3,000 strong. Frequent appeals are issued for volunteers for these formations.The appeals state that men enlisted will be given a [through training on land, and will then be detailed for service on board ship.In addition there is a Kiistenwehr Regiment, employed in the North Sea defended,ports.It is estimated that the strength of the marine fighting troops in Germany,independent of the Reichswehr and the men employed on minesweeping, is about12,000.
I). Aimed Forces under the Federal Ministry of the Interior.1. General. It is believed that the armed forces controlled by the Federal Ministryof the Interior are being grouped in a uniform organization for.the preservation of lawand order.This organization comprises the following forces : (a.) The Sicherheitspolizei (Armed Constabulary).(b.) The Zeitfreiwilligen (Temporary Volunteers or Reichswehr Reserves).(c.) The Einwohnerwehr (Civic Guards).(d.) The Technische Nothilfe (Technical Volunteers).(e.) The following special local police formations are probably also under theMinistry of the Interior : Grenzschutz Polizei (Frontier Protection Police).Hafenschutztruppe (Harbour Guards).Wasserschutz (Water Guards).*Eisenbahnwehr (Railway Guards).(f.) Gendarmerie and Civil police.2. Command of the Forces under the various Ministries of the Interior. (a.) General. A German Army Order of the 23rd October states that the control ofthe following forces is entirely vested in the civil authorities and that they are iu no way under the Reichswehr authorities : (i.) The Sicherheitspolizei.(ii.) The Einwohnerwehren.(iii.) The Technische Nothilfe.A Reichswehr Ministry Order of the 7th November states that the provisionof arms for Zeitfreiwilligen no longer concerns the troops, as the Zeitfreiwilligen are*now dependent on the Federal Ministry of the Interior.A German Army Order of the 22nd November, 1911, states that the supplyof arms, ammunition and equipment for Sicherheitspolizei, Einwohnerwehren,Wasserschutz and other organizations not subordinate to the Reichswehr Ministry, hasbeen taken over by the Federal Ministry of the Interior.(b.) The Chain of Command. The chain of command of the forces under the ministries of the Interior is organized as follows : .   (i.) Under the Federal Government.Federal Ministry of the Interior.Zentralstelle fitr Zentralstelle fur Zentralstelle fiirSicherheitspolizei Einwohnerwehren Technische Nothilfe(Berlin). (Berlin). (Berlin).The above are the central organizing headquarters for these forces throughoutGermany, it is not known to what extent the work of these organizing departments isco-ordinated.(ii.)

(Civic Guards).f This force may be under the Reichswehr Ministry or the Ministry of Transport.(7s61) &apos; a 2
The Police and Civic Guard Organization in Wurttemberg is the most completeorganization of its kind in Germany. In Prussia and the other Federal States the organisation of command is not, as yet, so clearly defined; it is believed that theWurttemberg organization will be adopted throughout Germany.(c.) Military control. Although the forces under the Ministries of the Interiorare in normal times quite independent of the Military Authorities, it is most probablethat in times of serious disorder these forces - would automatically come under military control.A Prussian War Ministry Order of the 14th July states that in case oftroubles the police in any town will come under the orders of the garrison staff officer.The mobilization of the Einwohnerwehren in the districts north of the RiverMemel was recently ordered by Reichswehr Wehrhreis Kommando I (East PrussianArea Command) for the period of evacuation of German troops from the Baltic States.3. Strength and Organization of the Sicherheitspolizei [Armed Constabulary). (a.) General. The Sicherheitspolizei is mainly recruited from officers and non-commissioned officers of the former German Army, the officers in particular are very carefully selected. All subordinate officials in this force rank as non-commissioned officers.The force is chiefly required for employment in the large towns and industrial areas, with the object of dealing with organized disturbances, and also to combat theoutrages committed by large bands of armed criminals, which are so prevalent inGermany at the present time.With the compulsory reduction of the Reichswehr under the Peace Treaty, theGerman Government considered a force of this nature to be necessary to preserve order.This force is especially trained for street and house-to-house fighting. The menare quartered together in barracks and are armed with all modern weapons such asmachine guns, trench mortars, flammenwerfer and a few light howitzers. TheSicherheitspolizei has also a limited number aeroplane flights. The official designationof units in the Sicherheitspolizei have been chosen so as to vary from the normalmilitary designation of units.In normal times the Sicherheitspolizei carry out patrol duties, and provide bodies of men held in readiness in case of emergencies. They are also occupied in training and organizing Einwohnerwehren. They are not to interfere in the functions of the criminal or civil police. The need of a force of this type was emphasized during therecent Spartacist disorders in Berlin, Leipzig and Hamburg, and throughout the indus-trial districts in Germany. The civil police, armed with sabres only, were quitepowerless to cope with armed Spartacists.(b.) Command. Normally the Sicherheitspolizei are under the Polizeiprdsident ofthe town in which they are garrisoned. A War Ministry Order of the 14th July, 1919,stated, however, that in case of troubles the police will come under the senior garrisonstaff officer of the town.(c.) Sicherheitspolizei Organization in Bavaria. The composition of the BavarianPolizekvehr (Sicherheitspolizei) is given as an example of the organization of this force in Germany : (i.) Higher Command. The Bavarian Sicherheitspolizie is under a Major-general who has a considerable headquarters staff at his disposal., (ii.) Establishments. The force comprises the following staff and units : 	Total establishment.	Total units.	Higher officials (officers).	Subordinate officials (non-commissioned officers.)-5 Abteilung Staffs 27 Hundertschaften (Centuries) 2 Communication Units        ............ 1 Ammunition Park......      ........ 1 Police Hydroplane Plight............ 1 Streifstaffel (Mobile Echelon)       ..........	19 26 51 81 20 9 7 &apos;9 36 3 3 6	56 76 130 2,997 712 301 67 39 234 42 59 &apos;   142	270	4,855-.. *! , t      -   - - *     ^A&amp;iM^^ iff tW^^r-Miaaril
(iii.) Arms and equipment. The subordinate officials are armed with rifles, bayonetsand hand grenades.The Bavarian Polizeiwehr is provided with the following equipment: 8 light field howitzers (2 per technical century).16 guns mounted on lorries (4 per technical century).4 medium Minenwerfer (1 per technical century).8 light Minenwerfer (2 per technical century).The number of machine guns allotted to the force is not clear, but each century hastwo ammunition wagons for machine gun ammunition.Two of the four technical centuries have one tank on their establishment.The force lias a total of 44 aeroplanes and hydroplanes. This figure includesmachines in reserve.Infantry centuries have practically no transport; the technical centuries areequipped with a few light lorries.(&apos;/.) Strength of the Sicherheitspolizei. It is estimated that t&apos;he Sicherheitspolizeiforce in Germany is to be about 70,000 strong. Of these 10,000 are allotted to the berlin area. As appears from the preceding paragraph, Bavaria, with over 6,000,000inhabitants, is to have just over 5,000 Sicherheitspolizei,The formation of the force is not yet complete, and it is reported that it is intendedto reduce the ordinary civil police in consequence of its creation.The Sicherheitspolizei wear a green-grey uniform, very similar to the Reichswehruniform4. Strength and organization of the Zeitfreiwilligen formations. --(a.) Command and Organization.   The Zeitfreiwilligen organization appears tohave orginally arisen on the initiative of certain local Reichswehr Commanders, who wished to ensure a reserve for their units in lace of the reduction of the Reichswehrand the troubles expected during the present winter. Subsequently the movementreceived official recognition.A Reichswehr Ministry Order of the 6th December, 1919, lays down the guidingprinciples for the organization of this force.Zeitfreiwilligen units have normally been raised and organized by the localReichswehr units within their garrison areas; in certain parts of Germany, notablyWiirttemberg and Saxony, however, the Zeitfreiwilligen organizations appear to bemerely a branch of the Einwohnerwehr (Civic Guards) (see D. 5 below) and of theTechnical Volunteers (see D. 6 below).- A circular issued by the Federal Ministry of the Interior and republished inGermania of the 30th October, stated that the Zeitfreiwilligen organizations were to be incorporated in the Einwohnerwehr.Appeals for Zeitfreiwilligen have recently been issued by large numbers ofReichswehr units.(b.) Duties, training and pay of the Zeitfreiwilligen. Zeitfreiwilligen are primarily recruited for the preservation of order in Germany and to act as reserves forthe Reichstvehr for this purpose.ZeitfrekviUigen will only be called up in the case of serious disorders beingimminent. When called up the Zeitfreiwilligen serves under exactly the same conditions as the Reichswehr soldier as regards pay, rations, compensation in case ofinjuries and pensions. Zeitfreiwilligen are to be disembodied as soon as the emergencyfor which they were called up is over.Zeitfreiivilligen are normally organized in companies, squadrons and battalions,and these units are affiliated to the local Reichswehr units. A certain amount oftraining is carried out, and roll calls and inspections are held.Arms, and in some cases uniforms, are kept in stores by the affiliated Reichswehrunit.(c.) Strength. The Zeitfreiwilligen are estimated to be between 150,000 and200,u00 strong.5. Strength and organization of the Einwohnerwehr (Civic Guards). (a.) General. Einwohnerwehren were originally local forces raised to protect the civilian inhabitants and their property against Spartacist outbreaks and against crimesof violence. They are practically Civic Guards, liable for service in their own communes,only in the event of local disturbances.The Einwohnerwehr is organized in companies under leaders elected by the menthemselves.   The chiefs of districts are apparently appointed by the civil authorities.The men are.armed with rifles and revolvers; some units have machine guns at
their disposal, the scale of issue being in some instances as high as five machine guns perhundred men.   Arms for the Einwohn&amp;rwehr are supplied by the various Ministries ofthe Interior in &quot;Wurteinberp&apos; through the Polizeiwehr.    The rifles of Einwohnerwehrenare nominally kept in depots under a guard, the men being issued only with the bolts.Men of the Einwohnerwehr are not provided with uniforms ; they are issued withbrassards and passes only.Special sections (Hausivehren) are organized in certain localities for the protectionof important State and public buildings.Einwohnerwehren consists in the main of the stable elements who have a stake inthe country. The organization has been continuously attacked by the Extieme Left asa powerful monarchist and counter-revolutionary organization. Recently appeals havebeen issued by the Majority Socialist papers, calling on Socialist workmen to join theEinwohnerwehr as a non-political force raised to support law and order and the existingRepublican regime.(b.) Command.-r-Einwolinerivehren are being raised by each commune or munici-pality. The general organization is being administered by the ZentraUtelle furEinwohnerwehren through the Landeschutz office in each state, and the variousOberprclsidenten and Landrdte. Propaganda and press work in connection with this force are controlled bv the Zentralstelle.The local commanders are elected by the units ; when&quot; called up they will carryout their duties under the orders of the police authorities. Doubtless in case of serioustroubles the command would pass to the military authorities.(c.) Duties, Training and fay. (i.) Einwohnerwehren will only be called up ifserious troubles are imminent. Under normal conditions they carry out their civilianoccupations.Normally members of the Einwohnerwehr receive no pay, except when actuallycalled up in case of an emergency. They then receive pay and allowances at IieicJmvehrrates ; they also become eligible for pensions, insurance, &amp;c.(ii.) In Wiirttemberg the Einwohnerwehr is composed of the following three categories: 1st Aufgebot (Levy). Provided with uniforms.   Liable for service throughoutWiirttemberg.This category appears to be the same as the Zeitfreiwilligen organiza-tion in other states.2nd Aufgebot. Provided with brassards.   Liable for service only in theirown commune.This category corresponds to the normal Eimvohnerwehr organization.The Ililfsdienst (Auxiliary Service).This category corresponds to the Technische Nothilfe in other states.It appears probable that the Wiirttemberg organization will be adopted through-out Germany; the decree of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, stating thatZeitfreiwilligen are to be absorbed in the Einwohnerwehr, bears this out. It is also incomfbrmity with the general policy apparently at present pursued by the GermanGovernment of trying to relieve the R&amp;ichsuehr of the duty of preserving local order.(iii.) The Charlottenburg Municipality has recently voted a credit to pay for the keeping up of a permanent fbrce,of 100 men of the Einwohnerwehr, to carry out guardand patrol duties.This provision of a permanent nucleus for the Einwohnerwehren does not appear tobe generally adopted as yet. In certain localities volunteers from the Einwohnerwehrenperform daily guard and patrol duties.(iv.) A large number of notices appear in the German Press relative to musketrypractices and roll calls of Einwohnerwehren.An official order of the Zentralstelle states that this headquarters suppliesEinwohnerwehren with financial aid for musketry practices. &amp;c.(v.) The Einwohnerwehr in the districts north of the River Memel have beenmobilized in order to reinforce the frontier troops and frontier police, in order to preventincidents during the retirement of the German troops from the Baltic. This is thefirst occasion on which this force has been employed for this purpose.(d.) Strength of the Einwohnerwehr. The strength of the Einwohnerwehr isdifficult to determine.   It is estimated at between 300,000 to 400,000.A very large proportion of this force would probably not be available or willingfor service outside their own commune,
(j. Organization of the Technische Nothilfe (Technical Volunteers). The TechnicalVolunteers Organization is intended to ensure the continuance during any strike of thetechnical services and means of communication which are vital to the life of diecommunity. The Technical Volunteers have already frequently been employed on such work during various strikes.The Technical Volumeer Detachments were originally organized by the lieichswehrauthorities and expanded from the Technical Volunteers attached to certain Reichsivehrformations. Technical Volunteers will normally be called up when a state of siege isproclaimed by the reichswehr authorities. The organization is now under the uniformcontrol of a staff in Berlin ; the whole of unoccupied Germany has been divided intodictricts provided with Technical Volunteer Organizations. -The Technical Volunteer Organization is to work in close co-operation with theEinivohnerwehr. Men may belong at the same time to the Einwohnerwehr and theTechnical Volunteers.   Technical Volunteers cannot, however, be Zeitfreiwilligen.It is estimated that there are about 30,000 to 40,000 Technical Volunteers inGermany.7. Special Police Forces. The following special police forces are known to exist : (a.) Grenzsch:&apos;tz (Frontier Protection.) Police. These are being raised in the UpperSilesian and East a id West Prussian plebiscite areas. They appear to be formed orexactly the same lines as ordinary Sichersheitspolizei units.fb.) Hafenschutztru/upe (Harbour Protection Force). Such a force exists inHamburg. It is probably merely a, small armed police force for protection of the harbour, but may be only the name of the Harbour Einwohnerwehr.(c.) Wasserschutz.- This force is mentioned in an official order of the ReichswehrMinistry as being under the Ministry of the Inferior.No details are known regarding this force which is presumably a river or coastguardpolice force.(d.) Eisenbahnwehr (Railway Guards). This is a small force of 350 all ranksrecently raised in Silesia from railway personnel.This is probably a reichswehr organization.8. Gendarmerie and Civil Police. (a.) The Gendarmcrie.-The TerritorialGendarmerie, formerly partly under the military authorities, was entirely handed overto the Ministry of the Interior in July, 1919. The men of this force are, however, stillarmed and trained as soldiers. the force has been considerably increased since thearmistice, partly as: a result of the prevalence of crime, and partly owing to the adoptionof the eight-hour da\.(b.) The Civil Police (Schutzmannschaft). The civil police force has been cou-siclerably increased since the revolution, mainly owing to the adoption of the eight-hourday. This force, which is entirely under the various Ministries of the Interior, is to bedecreased when the Sicherheitspolizei is fully organized. It is reported that in future the civil police are only to be armed with a truncheon in place of a sabre.E. Appreciation of German forces on the 1st January, 1920.The following is a summarised estimate of the present strength of the german armed forces : (a.) Reichswehr (Regular Army)............       400,000(b.) Land forces of the Reichsmarine (Regular Navy)   ...   &apos;     12,000*(c.) Zeitfreiwilligen approximately        ...      ...   150,000 200,oOO*(d.) Einwohnerwehr (Civic Guard) approximately     300,000 400,000(e.) Sicherheitspolizei (Armed Constabulary)     ...     40,000  50,000Of the above, the Reichswehr and Reichsmarine alone are under the ReichsivehrMinistry, the remainder being under the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Under theterms of the Treaty of Peace Germany is permitted to retain the following armed forces and police : (1.) A regular army of 100,000 men.   The reduction to this number to be complete by 31st March, 1920.(2.) The number of gendarmes, police, custom officers, coastguards, &amp;c, shall notexceed the numbers functioning in these capacities in 191a.* These estimates cannot be considered of any real value.
The German organizations under the Federal Ministry of the Interior, viz. (c), (d\and (e) above are undoubtedly a contravention of the terms of the Treaty, and this facthas been, notified to the German Government by the Supreme Council.As matters stand at present, assuming that the Treaty of Paris is finally ratifiedbefore the 31st March, 1920, and Germany carried out her obligations according to theTreaty, she will have at her disposal at that date, forces to combat internal disorderamounting to an army of 100,000 men, and a police force of a similar size to that inexistence in 1913.The question arises whether in view of the disordered state oi the country, theincrease in crime and widespread feeling of unrest which exists in Germany, a force ofthis size will be sufficient to maintain order.   There is little doubt that the late winter and early spring will be a critical period, when the shortage of food will make itself&quot;most felt, and for this reason considerable disorders are to be expected.General Staff,29th December, 1919.
