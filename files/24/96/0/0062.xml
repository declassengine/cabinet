Directorate of IntelligenceA SURVEY of revolutionary feeling in THE YEAR 1919special report-No. 13
A Survey of Revolutionary Feelinin the Year 1919In looking back over the twelve months succeeding theArmistice it is interesting to note the fluctuations in revolutionaryfeeling. There is no subject on which it is more unwise to baseforecasts : societies and individuals who are a menace to thecommunity in one month may have been swept away by a newwave of opinion three months later, and the whole current ofworking class thought may be turned into a new channel by anabortive strike which boils up quite unexpectedly. Events inforeign countries have exercised a steadying influence on theLabour &quot;mind in England, though a dwindling minority of extrem-ists still believe that a violent revolution can be achieved bymeans of a general strike ; but every strike which fails has tended to discredit them, and the experience of the past year has shownthat, while working class opinion is tending slowly but surelyto the left, the belief in the possibility of violent revolution haswaned and the mass of working men have shown themselves, inthis as well as in other matters, to. be sane and sensible&apos; whenever they understand all the facts. Unfortunately, they understandvery few of the facts about elementary economics ; they aresuspicious of what they call the &quot; capitalist press &quot; ; they haveocular proof of the fact that the employer class spends moneylavishly and that the price of everything which the working manbuys has risen enormously ; and they have as yet been unable tosee that every demand which they make for increased wagesresults inevitably in a rise in the cost of living.There can be no doubt that International Labour Conferencesabroad do good in this country.   A few days ago Mr. Crawford
once a fire-brand in South Africa, whence he was deported,returned from the Labour Congress in Washington, and in thocourse of conversation said that his observations on the conditionof Labour in the United States had convinced him that trueliberty for Labour was only to be found under the British flag :it was, he said, only in England and he even included Ireland that working men could meet employers and members of theGovernment and discuss a dispute &quot; as man to man.&quot;Extremist speakers are under the illusion that the employerclass is a small minority for which the manual labourers are compelled to toil as &quot; wage slaves.&quot; As a matter of fact, thoughan accurate census is impossible, the persons liable to Income tax and their families in this country probably outnumber the non-Income Tax payers and their families : in other words, if thepolitical line of cleavage were ever to be drawn between the&quot; Haves &quot; and the &quot; Have Nots,&quot; the latter would be slightly in a minority.November 1.1th, 1918, was a sinister date in more than oneneutral country, for on that day there were attempts at revolutionboth in Switzerland and Holland, and there were many people inthis country who thought that the weeks following the Armisticemight be very critical for the stability of England. It is character-istic of Englishmen that the forebodings, in which many of usseem to take so much pleasure, are always far worse than theevent itself, and there has been nothing more satisfactory thanthe admission of Communists in other countries that the british public is too far sunk in apathy and in acquiescence with itscondition of slavery to Capitalism to make it worth while to spendenergy or funds in attempting to convert it to the gospel ofRevolution.The number of British-born persons who desire a violentrevolution is apparently stationary, but the number who are determined to have a revolution by constitutional means iscertainly increasing and among them are those who are lickingtheir lips at the idea of obtaining control of the Navy, Army and police Forces through Parliament as instruments for overturningthe present social organisation. Every act of foolish ostentationon the part of the well-to-do is fuel to this smouldering fire.The causes which contribute to revolutionary feeling may begiven in the order of their importance as follows :1. Profiteering and high prices.2. Insufficient and bad housing accommodation.3. Class hatred, aggravated by the foolish and dangerousostentation of the rich, the publication of large dividends,and distrust of a &quot; Government of profiteers.&quot;4. Education by Labour Colleges, schools and classes and better circulation of literature on Marxian economics.5. Influence of extremist Trade Union leaders Mann,Cramp, Smillie, Hodges, Bromley, Hill, Williams,Turner.6, Unemployment,
7. Labour press, particularly the &quot;Daily Herald,&quot; &quot;TheWorkers&apos; Dreadnought&apos;&quot; and &quot;The Worker.&quot;8. External influences Russia, Ireland, Egypt, India.The steadying influences are :1. Popularity of the Royal Family.2. Sport.3. Poverty of revolutionary organisations.4. Jealousy between Trade Unions and their leaders.5. Return of saner Labour elements from the Forces andill-feeling between them and shirkers.6. Increase in the amount of money handled by the Avorkingclasses.JANUARY.Important Dates.January 1st   47 hour movement takes effect in engineering and (Shipbuilding industries.ii    10th   Military Riots at Folkestone.ii    14th   Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of GreatBritain at Southport.ii    17th   Conference of Workers&apos; Committees ; inceptionof &quot; Hands Off Russia &quot; Movement.ii    19th   Meeting of Policemen decides to insist onrecognition of National Union of Police andPrison Officials.ii    27th   Strike on Clyde.The year opened ominously, for the defeat of the pacifist andrevolutionary candidates in the General Election brought into being an underground movement for Direct Action, on the pleathat the House of Commons had ceased to represent the country as a whole.   There was a determined attempt to undermine the morale of the Army, which had been weakened by irritation atthe delay in demobilisation.   There was some ground for believing that enemy propaganda had been at work : however this may be,the riots at Folkestone and at Calais proved that insubordinationhad made some progress.The miners&apos; programme of immediate nationalisation, a six-hours&apos; day and an advance of 30 per cent., which was formulatedat Southport, contained a threat of industrial action if it was notconceded.Widespread demands were made for shorter hours, especially on the Clyde, and the Workers&apos; Committees seized upon these asan excuse for fomenting revolution. At that time the Workers&apos;Committees, composed of the unofficial Shop Stewards, otherwiseknown as the Rank and File Movement, had a good deal of power in London, Sheffield, Coventry, Wales and the Clyde district.The distinction between the unofficial and the official movement
is that in the former there is no elected body with executive powers, and all questions of policy have to be referred to the rank and file. The introduction of a forty-seven hour week in theengineering and shipbuilding industries, in both of which theWorkers&apos; Committees were powerful, brought affairs to a head,and at the end of the month there were extensive strikes on the clyde and elsewhere.   These were revolutionary in character.In this month the British Industrial Workers of the Worldheld their first meeting for many years, and Trade Unionists andCo-operators met to discuss a plan for a joint control of industry.FEBRUARY.Important Dates.February 1st Eight hour day for Railwaymen takes effect.ii      5th   New Defence of the Realm Regulation makesstrikes at Power Stations illegal, and causescollapse of projected general strike.Railway Clerks&apos; Association obtains recog-nition.ii      7th   Edvard Soermus (Russian Bolshevik) arrestedfor deportation.ii      8th   Large   &quot; Hands   Off   Russia&quot;  meeting   atAlbert Hall.ii     12th   Clyde strikers resume work.ii    27th   National Industrial Conference met.The month opened with a strike on the Clyde. The Workers&apos;Committees were now at the height of their power They demandeda thirty hour week and a minimum wage of  1 per day, and decided, to make Glasgow a touchstone for a General Strike, whichwas to be followed by revolution. Misled by initial success,Shinwell, Kirkwood and Gallacher called out the London elec-tricians when the strike was already on the wane, but when they found that the Government had taken measures for carrying on work at the Power Stations, the electricians declined to come out.There was an attempt to seize the Town Hall in Glasgow, but theriots were quelled with comparatively little damage, and theleaders were arrested. this   month marks the beginning of serious industrial unrest inthe Triple Alliance. The Miners were beginning to press their demands, the Transport Workers claimed a forty-four hour weekand the consolidation of war wages, the Railwaymen were dis-satisfied with the eight hour day, and at the beginning of the month lightning strike occurred on the Underground Railway. TheCotton and Building Operatives claimed a forty-four hour week,and the Bakers demanded to be relieved of night baking.The morale of the Army, both in England and France, wascausing considerable anxiety. Branches of the National Federationof Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers were also res-tive, owing to a feeling that they were being badly treated. TheSailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Union, supported by the &quot; Herald,&quot;
came into the open as a revolutionary organisation in close touchwith the Workers&apos; Committees. Revolutionary literature was distributed by the Army letter bag, and a determined attempt wasmade to corrupt the morale of troops landing from abroad.The &quot; Hands Off Russia &quot; movement gained strength, and ata meeting at the Albert Hall every section of the revolutionary movement was represented on the platform. The working classeswere urged to arm themselves, and people who had not been follow-ing the movement began to betray serious alarm. A hundredSocieties affiliated themselves to &quot; The People&apos;s Russian Informa-tion Bureau,&quot; a revolutionary organisation founded by Miss SylviaPankhurst.MARCH.Important Dates.March 4th   Coal Mines Commission begins&apos;sitting.it    5th   Ex-Service men participate in demonstration ofunemployed .at Manchester.ii     6th   First Conference of National Advisory Councilof Trade Unionists and Co-operators in Londonii 8th The Commissioner of Police issues order that recognition of the National Union of police and Prison Officers has been definitely refusedby the Government.David Ramsey sentenced for seditious speech atCroydon. W. F. Watson arrested for speech at Albert Hall on February 8th, 1919.ii   20th   Cabinet adopts Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s Report.ii   31st   The &quot;Herald&quot; (weekly) becomes the &quot;daily herald.&quot;Revolutionary feeling had spread widely, but the storm centrehad shifted from the engineering industries to the Triple Alliance.Towards the end of the month, however, the coal miners agreed tohallot on the Sankey Report, and the unofficial strikes called inprotest against the attitude of the Government were not represen-tative. The Railwaymen and the Transport Workers had alsoleached a basis of agreement with the Government.This month marks the first signs of co-operation between theex-service men and Labour. The Sailors,&apos; Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;union claimed from their members that they should not interfere in industrial disputes. The branches of the National federation in South Wales began to consider affiliation with local Trade unions and threatened to support the Miners who were on strike. Asdemobilisation proceeded, the shortage of houses became moreacute, and even steady men became unsettled by this and theshortage of beer.In this month the Trade Unions and Co-operators came to anarrangement for mutual assistance, especially in regard to banking.Towards the end of the month it became evident that the
Workers&apos; Committees were losing power. The propaganda forshorter working hours failed : the Electrical Trade Union ballot ona strike to secure a forty-hour week did not yield the necessarymajority. As a sign that revolutionary feeling was declining maybe cited the Report of the Joint Committee on the Industrial Con-ference, which proposed to inaugurate a National Industrial Coun-cil as a step towards an understanding between Capital and Labour.APRIL.Important Dates.April Kith      Miners&apos; ballot on Sankey Award.Tor : 693,684Against :     76,992it 20th ] 27th Annual Conference of Independent Labourii 21st y Party at Huddersfielcl rejects amendment minister   22nd J     favour of Soviet Government for England.The most disturbed bodies during April were the Triple alliance and the ex-Service men. The Southport Conference of the triple alliance was important, for the principal of industrial action for political ends was accepted for the first time by the most powerfulTrade Union body in the Kingdom. Its principal demands werethe abolition of Conscription and the abandonment of intervention in Russia.There were frequent demonstrations on the part of ex-Servicemen, who appeared to believe that the employers were attempting to re-engage men on pre-war rates.During the month the storm centre shifted to South Wales,where the extremists were urging the Miners to oppose the SankeyAward.The revolutionary agitators now began to prepare for a twenty-four hours&apos; strike on May Day, in concert with the extremists inFrance and Italy.After the arrest of the strike leaders in Glasgow, the demand forshorter hours subsided. As is generally the case, the abortive strike had let off a good deal of bad blood. On the other, hand, the SinnFein movement became active, and a branch of the Irish Volun-teers was formed in Glasgow.There was a wide extension of Craft unionism during the month.Agricultural labourers, shop assistants, policemen and actorsbecame Trade Unionists.MAY.Important Dates.May   1st   Orderly May Day celebrations in many towns.ii    4th   Large Police Demonstration in Trafalgar Square.ii   11th   Attempt to brine; out attested soldiers.
May 13th   Publication in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; of the &quot; SecretCircular.&quot;ii 23rd Sir Auckland Geddes stated that it was unlikelythat railwaymen&apos;s new standard wages wouldequal war wage plus 33s. bonus.n 25th Trafalgar Square demonstration against peace terms.ii   26th   Fracas between police and disabled men trying toreach House of Commons.Contrary to expectation, the twenty-four hours&apos; strike, called for May Day, did not take place.Conscription, intervention in Russia, liquor control and un-employment were the matters that most affected Labour at thebeginning of the month.   Some impetus was given to the solidarityof Trades Unionists by the publication in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; ofwhat is known as the &quot; Secret Circular,&quot; a document issued byG.H.Q., Home Forces, and stolen by a N.C.O. employed on cle-jicalduties in one of the Commands. The publication of this document,which related to the use of soldiers during the strikes, provokedgreat resentment against the Government, which has scarcelyyet died down : in the West Riding, only those speakers whocondemned the Government could obtain a hearing.The discontent about pensions and unemployment among ex-Service men culminated in a disorderly procession of disabled mento the House of Commons. This procession came to blows with thepolice in Parliament Square. The &quot; Daily Herald&quot; had beenfostering the view that May 11th six months after the Armistice--was the date on which enlisted men could claim their discharge.May 11th was therefore a critical date, but the announcements ofthe Army Council frustrated the attempt, and the influence of theiSailors,&apos; Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Union, which was practicallybankrupt, began to decline. At this time, another organisation with revolutionary tendencies was founded- the National Unionof Ex-Service Men.During this month the morale of the Police began to giveanxiety. The Police Union was threatening a strike, and therewrere secret negotiations with the Triple Alliance to issue ballot papers on the question of a strike for the reinstatement of ex-PoliceConstable Spademan, who bad been dismissed for circulating strikepropaganda among his comrades.During this month, there were demonstrations against thePeace Terms by supporters of the Independent Labour Party.Classes were instituted for the teaching of Marxian economics.The resistance to payment of income tax on incomes less than 250 spread from Wales to the Midlands.On the whole, the situation was less satisfactory than in April.Revolutionary propaganda was fostered by the fine weather foropen air meetings.Mr. John McLean, who was conducting a campaign in SouthWales, announced that Lenin and Trotsky had appointed him thefirst President of the Soviet Republic of England.
JUNE.Important Dates.June   1st   Disturbance  amongst  ex-soldiers  at  Wolver-hampton.ii    0th   First Income Tax strike at Pontypridd.ii 8th Annual Conference of the National Federation of discharged and Demobilised Sailors andSoldiers decides not to amalgamate with anyLabour body.ii   10th   Annual Delegates Meeting of National Union of railwaymen at Plymouth.Conference of London Workers&apos; Committee reintervention.ii   17th   Epsom Riot.ii 23rd 10,000 Doncaster- miners strike for 24 hoursagainst intervention in Russia.ii 24th Executive of Triple Alliance consider attitude ofParliamentary Committee of Trade Union Con-gress to Southport Resolutions.ii   25th   Annual Conference of Labour Party.ii 30th Miss 0&apos;Neill, Sinn Fein agitator, fined for insult-ing behaviour in Hyde Park.The refusal of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade UnionCongress to support the Southport resolutions in favour of direct action for political purposes was less important than it seemed atthe time, for it had now become evident that the important unions were passing into the hands of extremists. At the Annual Con-ference of the National Union of Railwaymen, power was given tothe Executive to call a strike without a ballot, and the annual conference of the Labour Party elected many extremists.The temper of the discharged soldiers culminated in disturb -ances at Wolverhampton and at Epsom. There were also ColourRiots at Liverpool and Cardiff, which were partly ascribed to thepresence of American and Colonial troops. The riot at Epsomresulted in the death of one policeman and injuries to twelve others.During this month a small body, called the International Union of ex-Service Men, became violently revolutionary,Feeling against intervention in Russia, which had been zealouslyfanned by extremists, found expression in innumerable resolu-tions, which were found to have only paper value when the attempts to call a general twenty-four hours&apos; strike on June 23rd we^ehastily abandoned.During the month, owing to the high cost of living, there was an access of revolutionary feeling in London workshops. At Wool-wich the Soviet system was openly advocated, and the BritishSocialist Party was re-organised on a revolutionary basis.The agitation among the police began to revive, but as theTriple Alliance had refused its support a strike was deferred. Itwas noticeable that ballot papers had not been sent to members ofthe Force who were known to be loyal.
JULY.Important Dates.July   3rd      Annual Council Meeting of the General Federa-tion of Trade Unions at Scarborough.ii    4th      Deputation of Triple Alliance to Chancellor of exchequer re Income Tax question.Triennial delegate meeting of the Dock Wharfand Riverside and General Workers&apos; Unionseverely criticises mismanagement of trans-port industry.Police Bill passed.&apos;Government Announcement that price of coal would be raised by 6s. per ton.ii   12th      Report of Committee of Enquiry into NightBaking issued,i!   loth      Yorkshire Miners&apos; Strike.M 15th to 1  Conference of Miners&apos; Federation of Great18th   J    Britain at Keswick.n   23rd      Full and secret Delegate Meeting of triple alliance.During this month, profiteering and the increase in the price ofcoal, together with the question of Direct Action, were the prin-cipal causes of agitation among the working classes. The PeaceCelebrations provoked riots at Luton, Coventry, Bilston, Swindonand Fareham. It was clear, however, that irritation with high prices, rather than revolutionary feeling, underlay most of the unrest. It is always noticeable that the approach of the summerholidays is a palliative to discontent.The Miners&apos; Conference at Keswick rejected the Governmentoffer under the San key Award, but at the same time declined togive its Executive plenipotentiary powers and condemned un-authorised strikes. The keynote of the Conference was suspicionand mistrust of the Government. The Yorkshire Miners&apos; strikewas perfectly authorised under the rules of tho Miners&apos; Federationof Great Britain, which allows autonomy So its component sections..The &quot;Daily Herald &quot; campaign against the use, of Naval ratings as&quot; blacklegs &quot; failed.In this month, Lord Desborouglrs report on the police and thePolice Bill, prohibiting members of the Force from belonging to a union, were published. This steadied the loyal element in thePolice Force, which was greatly in the majority, but drove the smallrevolutionary, minority to extremes. Feeling among policemenwas particularly bad in Liverpool.Agricultural labourers were affected by general unrest, and inNottinghamshire, East Riding of Yorkshire, Warwickshire andOxfordshire there was a talk of Direct Action.In this month evidence was obtained that revolutionary leaders in England, France and America were in touch with one another and with Moscow.   Nevertheless, the international one-dav strike
was a fiasco. The London Workers&apos; Committee had circulated a programme, drawn up by the Clyde Workers&apos; Soviet Committee,which advocated inter alia : Disarming of all non-proletarian soldiers ; seizure of armsand ammunition by Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils ; armingof entire labour population as a Red Army ; expropriation ofall property, mines, banks and commercial establishments.Sheffield now became the storm centre, and ex-Service men inthat district were particularly restive.   On the other hand, middleclass feeling crystallised against nationalisation, and in Wales thereAvas a temporary counter-revolutionary movement amongst ex-Service men.AUGUST.Important Dates.August 1st Police strike for &quot; full and frank recognition &quot;of the National Union of Police and prison officers.ii      2nd  Bakers&apos; strike in London and Provinces.ii      4th   Lightning strike of railwaymen at Nine Elmsin support of Police.ii      7th   Virtual collapse of Police strike.ii 9th Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federationinstruct members to vote against direct action.ii     11th   Majority of Bakers resume work.ii 12th Conference of Triple Alliance Executive decide to postpone ballot on Direct Action.ii     18th   South Yorkshire miners resume work.ii 22nd 200 men of Gloucestershire, Warwickshire andBerkshire regiments refuse to embarkSouthampton.ii 23rd Conference of National Union of Ex-ServiceMen at Caxton Hall.On August 1st a lightning strike of the police was declared. Thepolice authorities were well informed of the plan and were quite prepared to meet the emergency. The publication of the enhancedwages of policemen had quite altered the position, and the greatmajority of policemen, except in Liverpool, were determined to stand fast. The strike was not industrial but revolutionary,especially in Liverpool, and it was really an attempt to revive thedeclining fortune of the Police Union officials, who had all declaredthemselves as revolutionary in sympathy. A large number ofwarders at Wormwood Scrubs Prison and a few at Birminghamcame out in sympathy, but when it became evident that the strikewas doomed to failure, reinstatement became the cry.   The strikers
were bitterly disappointed with the attitude of the Trades Unions,whom they accused of making promises which they did not intend to fulfil. &apos;The air was cleared as regards Direct Action, for leaders, suchas Mr. J. H. Thomas strongly opposed it, and at a Conference of theTriple Alliance Executive it was decided to postpone the ballot.On the industrial side, however, the National Union of Railwaymenbecame very restless, on the ground that negotiations were undulypostponed.The increase in pensions relieved the tension among ex-Servicemen, who were much more concerned with their own interests than with revolutionary views. The holidays also tended to allay dis-content. There were, however, during the month a number of unofficial strikes, and in some districts, such as Somerset, there wasa marked increase in revolutionary feeling. The IndependentLabour Party began to concentrate on their organisation for the municipal elections in November, and Mrs. Besant and her support-ors were touring the country in a national campaign for India.The feeling regarding intervention in Russia had practicallydied out, but in Southampton some 200 soldiers refused to proceedto France in the belief that their destination was Russia.During this month, ex-Service men began to agitate for back&apos; pay on the Colonial basis for British soldiers, a scheme which hadbeen put forward by Mr. R. L. Outhwaite in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot;of June 9th. .  .A feature of the month was the flowing tide of amalgamationin many important industries. There was also great opposition tothe employment of non-Union labour in the Dockers&apos; Union.On the whole, the extremists received a severe blow during themonth by the failure of the police strike, which they had countedupon as the beginning of a revolution. Labour generally was in asteadier mood, &apos;u anticipation of the annual Trade Union Congress.SEPTEMBER.Important Dates.September  2nd &quot;Meeting of Executive of Miners&apos; Federationof Great Britain.ii 3rd   Conference of Delegates of Miners&apos; Federa-tion of Great Britain,ii 4th   Full Delegate Conference of Triple Allianceconfirmed decision of Executive to post-pone ballot.ii 5th   Lieut. Colonel Sherwood-Kelly&apos;s letter on russia in &quot; Daily Express.&quot;ii        8th   51st Annual Trades Union Congress.ii 14th 28 ex-Service men start march from Man-chester to London.it 18th Amalgamation of Postmen&apos;s Federation,Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Associa-tion and the Fawcett Association.
The outcry against profiteering was the feature of the month.The cost of milk particularly exasperated Labour and the public at large, and over half a million people demonstrated in Hyde Parkagainst the high prices.The miners&apos; delegates decided to proceed with the ballot on direct Action, but this decision was reversed at the Triple Alliancemeeting on the following day.   It was evident at the Trade UnionCongress that a revolutionary minority had captured the organisa-tions and was at the bottom of the resolutions on nationalisationand. Direct Action.There was a march of discharged men from Manchester to Lon-don to protest against their treatment, but on. the whole the dis-content among ex-Service men was less acute.The agitation against intervention in Russia was revived, partly as a result of Lieutenant-Colonel Sherwood-Kelly&apos;s letter in the&quot; Daily Express.&quot;During this month the extremists made the best use- of thehousing difficulties.The curricula of the Labour Colleges were revised in order tofurther revolutionary propaganda.The City of London Branch of the Independent Labour Partyjoined the Third Moscow International.The ferment among the Railwaymen resulted in a national strike on September 26th. This strike was political rather thanrevolutionary. Mr. Cramp, wh o is fixr more revolutionary thanMr. Thomas, forced the pace, apparently in the belief that theGovernment would collapse and that a Labour Government would come into power under the cegis of the National Union of Railway-men. It failed because of the admirable organisation of the Pro-tection Committee and the Ministry of Food, and it showed howvast was the majority of people who declined to be starved by arevolutionary minority. The strikers counted, on the reservesupport of the Transport Workers and the Miners. When thisfailed, their leaders had to adopt the distasteful role of mediators,and it became evident that the great menace of the Triple Allianceto national stability was a bogey which might never become serious.The settlement of the strike was hailed by the Railwaymen leadersas a victory, and was condemned by many Englishmen as a sur-render : in fact, it was the wisest decision that could have beentaken, for while it saved the face of the moderate leaders such as,Thomas, and kept the extremists out of power, it proved to the september   20th   50,000 Iron Moulders strike.ii 21st Enormous anti-profiteering demonstrationin Hyde Park.ii 26th Strike of National Union of railwaymen and Amalgamated Society of LocomotiveEnginemen and Firemen;ii 27th Workers&apos; Committee Conference at Farring-don Hall discusses re-organisation to faci-litate Direct Action.ii        29th   W. T. Coode arrived from Russia.
extremists that the Government could defeat even a national strike,but would not trade upon its power. The Government organisa-tion was a great surprise to the extremists, and its influence hasbeen so good that even the Coal miners, whose place it would be most difficult to fill, have hesitated to strike for fear that theGovernment has some secret organisation by which it could carryon their work.OCTOBER.Important Dates.October   Gth   Railwaymen resume work.ii Oth Prime Minister informs deputations fromMiners&apos; Federation of Great Britain thatGovernment cannot accept Trade UnionCongress resolution regarding nationalisa-1 ion.ii      11th   Nationalisation meeting at Albert Hall.ii      13th   Goode&apos;s pro-Bolshevik articles started to ap-pearin &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; and &quot;daily express.&quot;ii 16th Sub-Committee of a Glasgow Soviet Com-mittee attempt a run on Greenock Provi-dent Bank.ii      20th   Miners&apos; propaganda campaign for nationalisa-tion opens in Provinces.ii      22nd Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain decidesin Conference to await report of Income TaxCommission - before taking further &apos; actionin the matter.Tom Mann elected General Secretary of Amal-gamated Society of Engineers.ii      23rd   First Meeting of Sub-Committee appointed toconsider formation of a &quot; General Staff for labour.&quot;ii      28th   Lieut. Colonel Malone, M.P., arrives fromRussia.The attempt to form a Civic Guard during the Railway Strikeawakened widespread suspicion and resentment, and there was aproposal to form a &quot; General Staff for Labour,&quot; and to achieve a working arrangement between the Trade Unions and the Co-operative Societies, by which, in a future General Strike, the strikerswould be supplied with food while the rest of the community wouldstarve.Though a good deal of class hatred seems to have found ex-pression during the Railway Strike, the attempt to represent theGovernment attitude as an attack upon Trade Unionism as a wholefailed to secure support in spite of the efforts of the Labour Press.As might have been expected, the abortive strike resulted in per-sonal jealousy between the leaders.   Both Mr. Smillie and Mr,
Robert Williams condemned the policy of the National Union of railwaymen, on the ground that it should have notified the othercomponents of the Triple Alliance before a strike was called. Therewas also dissension between Messrs. Thomas, Cramp and Bromley.The British Socialist Party joined the Third Moscow Inter-national.Generally speaking, there was keen disappointment with theprofiteering tribunals, which failed to allay the unrest caused byprofiteering.The Police strikers were depressed, and the small donationsthey received from Trade Union contributions failed to alleviatetheir financial straits.NOVEMBER.Important Dates.November 4th Special General Meeting of National Unionof Railwaymen to receive report of Ex-ecutive on progress of negotiations.ii    7th &amp; \ Meeting in various towns to commemorate10th J    Russian Bolshevik revolution.ii 7th Special Delegate Conference of NationalUnion of Railwaymen to consider revisionof rules, particularly the division of secre-tarial duties.ii      24th   Unemployment donation to civilians ceases.ii 27th Secret meeting of Triple Alliance to settlematters relating to the Railway Strike.The important event of the month was the sweeping victory ofLabour candidates in the Municipal Elections. Many of the cand-idates were frankly revolutionary, and aimed at converting Muni-cipal organisations into local Soviets. They appear to have beentamed by their success and it was reported from more than onecentre that they seemed to be more concerned with the socialstatus of their wives and with payment for their municipal servicesthan with revolution.During this month the miners&apos; leaders conducted a great pro-paganda campaign for nationalisation, but without any markedsuccess.Profiteering and the housing difficulties became acute, especiallyamong ex-Service men. The announcement that the Unemploy-ment Donation was to cease was a great blow to the Trade Unions,who regarded it as subsidiary finance for strikes.Lieut.-Colonel Malone,M.P., and Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy,M.P., engaged in lecturing tours throughout the country as apolo-gists for the Russian Bolshevik Government. Both expressedsympathy with the Industrial Workers of the World, an organisa-tion which devotes itself to sabotage in America.Leeds had become the storm centre, owing partly to the Muni-cipal campaign and partly to the long drawn out moulders&apos; strike.The Co-operative movement among Trade Unions was growing
very fast. Trade Union funds were transferred to the Co-operativeBanks and arrangements made for the supply of food and clothingto strikers.Dining the month very violent speeches were made, and it was evident that working class opinion was moving to the Left. Everyeffort was being made by extremists to fan class hatred, and itwas a sinister phenomenon that some of the Trade Union Reportsrecited class grievances to the exclusion of Union affairs.The moulders&apos; strike began to paralyse other industries and toswell the ranks of the unemployed.DECEMBER.Important Dates.December   8th   Hands Off Russia meeting of 1,000 peopleat Holborn Hall.ii    9th to \ Special Trade Union Congress on nationali-ii      10th /   sation and high prices.ii      12th   Kyriakos Mikhail, a British protected sub-&apos; ject, was deported to Egypt for stirringup trouble amongst Egyptians and forcirculating libellous statements regardingBritish troops.ii      14th   Liverpool police strikers re-started cam-paign for reinstatement.ii      16th   Building Trade Conference attended by prime Minister.The month opened with rumours of lightning strikes among the railwaymen and Dockers. The latter were claiming 16s. a day,which was net in the least likely to be conceded. The abolition ofthe Unemployment Donation to civilians was causing widespreaddiscontent, and in towns such as Barrow, where the West of Scot-land Soviet has a branch, the situation became menacing.There was a talk among the Sinn Feiners in England, who arestrongest at Manchester and Liverpool, of armed outrage.The Special Trade Union Congress, convened to consider thequestion of nationalisation of the coal mines, decided to deferaction. It was evident that they had no hope of obtaining their demands except by a strike or by an election.Throughout the month there was great discontent amongst ex-soldiers, who now began to claim that the National Relief Fund andthe Canteen Fund should be used for their benefit.The cry against intervention in Bussia, which had died down,received a fresh impetus from the speeches of Messrs. Malone andGoode.A curious movement called &quot; The Catholic Crusade &quot; came intoprominence on account of its &quot; Sixpenny Sermons,&quot; which preachedrevolutionary doctrine.There was a split among the extremists owing to a manifestoby the Independent Labour Party against Soviet Government inEngland.
The year closed with a prospect of a settlement of the IronMoulders&apos; strike, but with the threat of strikes in the Transport and mining industries early in the year.A forecast of the events of 1920 is impossible. All that can besaid is that class prejudice and ignorance of elementary economicshas a firmer grip upon the working class of the country than ever before, and that the Labour vote has greatly increased and is increasing. The signs are against any violent revolution, but infavour of a gradual evolution through the ballot box. The greatneed for the moment is instruction, and unfortunately almost theonly agency is the Labour Colleges, which are imparting instruction in false economics. Nevertheless, it may confidently be said thatin the violent dislocation of the social machinery, caused by the war,England is readjusting herself more smoothly than any other country in the world.
