SECRET.Ho.580. &quot;DELHI&quot; at COPENHAGEN.31st December 1919.Sir,I have the honour to forward herewith this myreport on my yearTs Service in Command of His Majesty&apos;sNaval Forces in the Baltic, where I relieved Rear-admiral sir Edwyn S. Alexander-Sinclair, K.C.B., I/..V.0., on the6th January 1919.2.- &quot;When I arrived the German situation was as followsGerman Troops were nominally in occupation of Latvia,with Headquarters at Libau.The Bolshevics were in Riga, and gradually advancingSouth and west.The German Troops were of low morale, and inrporrrstate of discipline - and wherever the Bolshevics advancedthe Germans fell back, in many cases handing ever arms and munitions to the Bolshevics on their retirement..3.- The re edy for this state of affairs was, either forthe Allies to insist on the effective occupation by theGermans of this Province with reliable Troops under theTerms of Article XII of the armistice, - or for allied troops to take this duty over, - or to send Allied officers to organise, amalgamate and lead the various fighting forces,other than German, belonging to these Territories, namely :-LETTS, LITHUANIANS, BALTIC-GERMANS,its-RUSSIANS and    ESTHONIANS,with various volunteer detachments ofSUEDES,        FINNS,     and DANES.All these were willing and anxious to resist Bolshevism,but none trusted the other; all, however, admitted thatthey would fight under the orders of a British Officer.A few cargoes of equipment and munitions were also necessary.4.- These alternatives I repeatedly urged in my letters and telegrams to Their Lordships, but received no definitereplies/SECRETARY OF TEE ADMIRALTY,THEC Oldk AID ER- IN-CHIEF,H..k.

Force being raised,and constant cases of friction, oppression and disarmament ofLettish. Troops began to occur,.8o- The climax was reached on the 16th April, when at theNaval Harbour    where the headquarters of the Lettish troops were - German droops raided these Headquarters, arrested anddisarmed all the Officers and looted money and documents,killin.&quot; and wounding several Lettish soldiers *Simultaneously with this, in the to- n of Libau itself,Baltic-German Troops arrested those members of the LettishGovernment who were unable to escape them - whilst the resttook refuge on board His majesty5s Ships, and to, Ulmanis, the acting Pre si-, ent, with the British mission, which consequentlywas surrounded by Baltic-German Sentries.9.- That night two young Baltic-German Officers came off tomy Ship, and announced that they were the Beads of the Commit-iee of Safety until the formation of a new Government     and asked me   if I could guarantee them the support of His majesty&apos;sGovernment in this movement *I pointed out to them that until I had some satisfactoryexplanation for the events of the day I could listen to andrecognise no such proposals.I then sent them on shore again and heard nothing more of them.

That the Commanding Officer of the offendingBaltic-German unit should be relieved, of hisC ommand:Ve also gave him the time and date by which we required thefulfil sent of these demands *19*- Both were complied with within the time, but Von derGoltz stated that as he considered the Lettish Government tobe Bolshevic, and a danger to the District he was administer-:ing by order of the Allies, he could not agree to their release from arrest, or the continuance of their functions.13.- This state of affairs was reported to Paris according-ly, and a very few da$s afterwards, owing to the melting ofthe ice, and signs of activity by the Bolshevic Fleet, I hadmyself to proceed tc the Gulf of Finland, and CommodoreArthur A .M.. Duff, C.B., arrived on the 29th Itay and tookcharge of affairs in the Western Baltic : and thereafter,by his quick and accurate grasp of the whole German situation there, freed me from a very considerable portion of mypr e o c cu p a t i ons .He at onvre astablished a dominating influence over theother Allied Officers and missions, and controlled them allwith the utmost decision and harmony.    It is hard for me todo justice on paper to the adequacy and effectiveness ofhis administration, until he laft for England again on the28th September *I have now transferred to him the duties of senior naval Officer in the Baltic *14;- On arrival in the Gulf of Finland and reviewing thesituation, my hope and intention was - as soon as iceconditions allowed it - to move as far East as possible, inorder to support the Loft Flank of the Esthonian  &quot;rent, and toprotect it from any attc.pt at being turned from the Sea.15.- After getting into touch with the Estonian Naval andLilitary authorities, I went over to Helsingfors to call onthe Regent (General G.Ivia.:.nerheim) , and also to congratulatethe Finns on the recognition of their Independence, whichhad been announced the previous day.   Circumstances then&apos;obliged, me to return to Libau for a day on the 12th hay.
( BALTIC LETTER No. 580 - 31 December 1010 - tc ADMIRALTY andCOfcikANDER-IH-CKIEF, ATLANTIC -)16.-        I had previously - on the 7th Lay - shifted my Flagfrom &quot;CALEDON&quot; to &quot;CURACOA&quot;.On returning from Libau to Reval on the 13th May&quot;CURACOA&quot; struck a mine, whioh disabled her from fartherservice and occasioned eleven casualties amongst her Personnel.17.-        I therefore shifted to &quot;CLEOPATRA&quot;, and left Revalthe next morning for the Eastward, and, from the 14th Mayonwards, I lay - first in Narva Bay for a few days,reconnoitring as far as Eaporia whilst the Estonians were&apos;landing and operating between there and Louga - and then, asthey established themselves further East, I moved forward toSeakar, from which place, with the very good visibilityprevailing day after day, I was able from the kasthead tokeep an effective w/tch on Pctrograd Bay.18.-      . The situation then was somewhat of an anxiety to me, .as the strength of the Bolchevic Naval Forces was known toinclude Armoured Ships - the Estonians were&apos; lying in Ksporiawith unarmed Transports, (including the Nekmangrund LightVessel, so hard up were they for ships), an old slow ex-Russian Gunboat &quot;BOBR&quot;, and one ex-Russian Destroyer, depend-ent on ne for fuel of which I has then only a limited supply-and, my own Force consisted only of &quot;CLEOPATRA&quot; and four destroyers, the Seventh Submarine Flotilla arriving shortly,afterwards at Reval.19.-        From then onwards I maintained a .atch on the Bay,whilst the Estonians were constantly in contact with theBolshevic Troops, bombarding and pushing forward here andtheref and landing more men, whilst relieving those whoneeded refit, always under the direction of Admiral JohnPitka who, before the \!ar, was a Shipowner of Reval andDirector of a Salvage Company, but who assumed command of theEstonian-Naval Forces last Winter, and has always shown a mostcorrect instinct for i&apos;.ar, both on Land and Sea.20.-       On the 17th Lay a great deal of smoke was observedover Cronstadt, and on the, 18th vessels were seen coming Westclose under the land and evidently with the intention of attacking the Estonians.The driving back of these vessels was the subject of myletter No. 54/525.A. of 20th kay 1919. (Copy attached).21.-        On the 24th Lay, General Sir Hubert Cough arrived in&quot;GALATEA&quot; on a special Lission to Finland and the BalticStatest and I accompanied him over to Helsingfors to assistat his Ceremonial Landing, and to salute him there, and wentwith him to interview the Finnish Authorities, thereafter ..leaving again for the Eastward, leaving &quot;GALATEa&quot; atHclsingforc.22.-        On the 31st Lay, further movement of ^hips from&apos;Cronstadt was observed, and the Dreadnought Battleship&quot;petro pavlovsk&quot;, with some small craft, came out to the Easternedge/

(Copy attached.)23o It now became apparant to me that with the smallForces at my disposal it would be necessary, in order to keepan effective watch on Bolshevic Naval movements, and inparticular to, if possible, ensure that no lv-ines were laid tothe Westward of the existing Fields across the entrance toPctrograd Bay, that I should have a base nearer to Cronstadtthan Revalj and I therefore asked the Finns to allow me touse Biorkol24-j-        This they were most willing to do, and I thenestablished Patrols consisting of two Submarines (workingfrom their Base at Reval) in Kaporia Bay watching the South-ern exit of tho swept channel, and two or three Destroyersoff Stirs Foint watching the Northern exit - I also put aWatching Post of an Officer and three men in the Stirs PointLighthouse, (afterwards Increased to throe Officers and nineother ratings with a Portable wireless Telegraph set.)25.-        Ao my Force consisted of Light Unarmoured Vessels only,my desire was to attempt nothing in the nature of a forlorn-hope, which by its failure would be likely to encourage theEnemy, and therefore I did not permit - what every SubmarineOfficer was on fire to essay - namely, an attack on theAnchorage and Port of Cronstadt through the Minefields, butset myself to keep as Close a watch on them as the minefieldsand Forts allowed, in order to loam their intentions, theisisKpsffiittx composition of their Naval Force, and to prevent anyfurther Uino laying to the- Westward *It was evident by then that their Active Squadron    -- .consisted of :-2,   Battleships, (h Dreadnought &quot;petro pavlovsk&quot;)1.   Cruiser *and 5*   Large Destroyers.26*-        Up to about the end of ,June there were constantattempts by Enemy Light Craft to break out on the Northernside at Night, and both to sweep and lay Mines - and a gooddeal of shooting, though little hitting, went on between thePatrols - also, there is no doubt more Lines were laid by theBolshevics to the Southward of Stirs Point, and to the East-ward of the existing Line Barrier.27^-        On the 13th June, very heavy firing broke out betweenFort Krasnaya Gorka and the Forts and Ships at Cronstadt, -Fort Krasnaya Gorka having suddenly turned over to the Whites&apos;who however wore not strong enough to hold It - the forcesimmediately available being only a hundred or so of badlyarmed and much exhausted Ingermanlandors, who, owing to the fire from the Bolshevic Heavy Ships, were unable to occupy the fort long&apos; enough either to effectively man the guns, ordestroy them - and so, after changing hands twice, KrasnayaGorka remained in Bolshevic hands.
(BALTIC LETTER No.580 - 31 December 1919 - to the admiralty and C O&amp;iiiANDER-IN-CEIEF, .-TLABTIC .)26*-       These Ingermanlanders were fighting under the directionof the Estonian Command, and were armed, and equipped by them,chiefly from supplies captured from Bolshevics, and had donevery well ever since these operations under Admiral Pitkastarted, and were fighting with more enthusiasm as itwas their own country they were freeing.&apos;Apparently however their successors aroused the suspicion and jealousy of the Russians of the Northern Corps,who - equipped and. supported in every way by the Estonians -had by then begun to become a considerable fighting force,and were holding the line on the Right of the Estonian -Ing erman3.and Force - whose Left Plank rested on the Sea andhacf^pushed forward as far as Krasnaya Gorka *29c-        These Russians decreed that the Ingermanlsnders wereplotting to form a Republic of their own, to the detriment ofthe Greater Russia they hoped to re-establish - and on thisplea they required the disarmament of the Ingermanlanders,and that they should be sent back to their villages, andcease to form part of the advance to retrograde     This was done in spite of the strong protest of the Estonian Command -and the immediate consequence of this vns the driving back bythe Bolshevics and partial collapse of that Plank to about twenty miles Westward so soon as it was taken over from theIngermanlanders by the Russians - who then began a series of daily appeals for Bombardments by my Ships, but for whichthey would have been annihilated and the Bolshevics againover-running Estonias30t-        This was the beginning of the friction and distrustbetween the Estonians and the Russian Army commanded byGeneral Yudenitch - which has unfortunately increased to an acute stage.31. I pointed out in the strongest terms - as also didGfeneral Sir Hubert Gough - that if this sort of intrigue, tothe detriment of Military operations, went on, they must not expect any more help from me, and I insisted on the reinstatement of the Ingermanlanders as a condition of myfurther action on that Flank - and this has now been done -but had the Russians supported, instead of disarming   themwo might well have taken and heId/lirashaya Gorka and Jronstadt.32c-        As I had not sufficient Ships to deal with any EnemyForce - should it break out - as well as to maintain an effective patrol on the entrance to Petrograd Bay, I consider-ed it advisable to lay Mines so as to restrict the movements of the Enemy - and this was done by &quot;PRINCESS MARGARET&quot;,(Captain Harry H.Smyth, C.L.G., D.S.O.) and the TwentiethDestroyer Flotilla on six dates between July and November *I also laid mines in the Bolshevic Swept Channel, tothe Eastward of their own Linefields, on five occasions bythe Costal hotor Boats.

Thereafter continued a close watch on Petrograd Bay -with frequent Bombardments by us of Bolshevic Positions on theSouthern shore, and occasional she1lings by Fort KrasnayaGorka and other guns - varied by incidents reported from timeto time, such as the sinking of &quot;OLEG&quot; by LieutenantAugustine W .S. Agar, V.C., D.S.O., - attacks by enemy submarines on our vessels, and intermittent activity byBolshevic Destroyers and Line-sweepers   - with occasionalappearances outside the Harbour by larger craft - until the, attack by the Coastal Iviotor Boats on the 18th August, after which nothing bigger than a Destroyer ever moved again - buta certain amount cf both Line Laying and Sweeping was observednear the approaches to the Harbour.35*-        The Incident of lur Goode of the Manchester Guardian&apos;Their Lordships will recollect was reported in my lettersNos. 566/520 and 576/620 of 7th and lGth September respectively.36Early in October the long talked of advance againstPetrograd by General Yudenitch began -   but, as he insisted on advancing straight up the Railway to Gatchina before making his Left Flank secure, by making the capture of FortsSaraia Lqt^Qhard and Krasnaya Gorka his first objective - asmyself aild^mher British Officer   connected with him urgedhim to do so - the attempt failed,- and he retreated evenmore rapidly than he advanced.37o Unfortunately the &quot;EREBUS&quot; arrived only after the attempt was doomed to failure, and by that time also the weather had broken, making It very unsuitable for Fliring, inorder to direct the firing of &quot;EREBUS&quot; - also oui? Machinesfand many of the Pilots, were from hard service through theSun-oner, rather past their best - the type of Machine too,(Short Seaplane) was unable to get sufficient height toavoid the very severe and accurate Anti-Aircraft fire fromthese two Forts.38. All that could be done by our Ships - (Light cruisers and Destroyers) besides &quot;EREBUS&quot;, in the way of shellingpositions and covering the advance, was done, - and always-within the range of Fort ^rasnaya Gorka&apos;s twelve inch guns,

(Copies ofmessages attached.)42. This, Commodore Brisson most faithfully and effectivelydid at Noon on the 15th October - apparently much to thesurprise of Bermont - who had, in reply to my Ultimatumstated that he was friendly to the Allies and was wnly resist-ing Bolshevism, and disowned all connection with the Germans -and whose forces were in position, and with little shelter,in some places less than one thousand yards from ours and theFrench Ships - Bermont having evidently assumed that hisstatements and arguments were sufficient to hoodwink me and delay our offensive act ion.43.-        This enabled the Lettish Troops to cross the River in strength, and with great enthusiasm, and after twenty-six daysfighting to sweep away all these Rusio-German Forces from within striking distance of Riga, and out of Mtau - which hadbeen the German ha In Base,and Headquarters throughout the year -Tukkum and the Windau district *44.-        On about the 30th October the threat to Libau by german Troops became serious, and I sent directions toCaptain Lawrence L.

224Krasnaya Gorka. This however was not done, and there wasno liaison between the Estonians and the Russians.50*-       The Estonians, so long as their advance was such thatthe gund of the Light, Cruisers and Destroyers of the BiorkoForce could support thorn, went forward - but thereafter theymet with strong and effective resistance and much barbed wire,and were held up within four miles of the land approaches toFort Krasnaya Gorka and suffered very heavy losses - equalto nearly one third of their Force, which did not at thebeginning exceed two thousand men.51*-        It was after this check that &quot;EREBUS&quot; arrived, (24thOctober), which encouraged Admiral Pitka, who was in command of the Estonian Forces, to try again - but by then theRussians had begun to fall back, thereby uncovering theEstonian Right Flank and causing thorn further distress, anddispersion of their few remaining effectivesjTho Russians and Estonians then fell back with considerable rapidity as far west as the Line Narva - Peipus Lake,and I devoted myself to endeavouring to ensure that, from theSea-, no further attempt was raade to further harass these verywar-weary and dispir&amp;ed Troops.52o-        I had constant fcumours that the Dreadnought Battleship&quot;SEVASTOPOL&quot; had been prepared for, and was In every way fit for, serviced- and by my reckoning there were still two largeDestroyers available as well, though tuo had been destroyedby our kinos during the operations in support of Yudenitchwhilst attempting to come out and attack our Patrols at night *53,-        The work of the Destroyers was as ever tireless,dauntless and never ending, and with never the relaxation oflying in a Defended Port with fires out and full rations -and all their work in cramped Navigational Waters necessitat-ing the almost constant presence on deck of the Captain -and, in the case of the Petrograd Bay &apos;Biorko1 Patrolalways within range, and often under fire, of the twelve Inch guns from Fort Krasnaya Gorka.54.-        This patrolling of Petrograd Bay, though generally insmooth water, was arduous and anxious always, because therewas no room to manoeuvre East or West - there were Mines ineach Direction - much foul ground, unindicated by the Charts -and the Charting of the Southern shore disagreed by a mile ofLongitude with that of the Northern - also for that smallspace (6 by 20 miles) bounded on the West by Scskarand on the East by the Linefields, three Charts had to be in use *55o-        In the whole of that Area, no shcals, (and there are *many), were marked by anything better than a Spar Buoy.When the Winter came on, with incessant snow and fogthroughout/(BALTIC LETTER No. 580 - 31 December 1919 - to the ADMIRALTY andCOLLIER----IN-CHIEF, ATLANTIC .)

The failure of the Allies to insist on the removal ofYon dar C-oltz after the occurrences of the 15th April - andtheir condonation of his defiance of their orders&apos;.(b) Their failure to supply Munitions and Military Missionswhen first recommended - i,,e&quot;, ,&apos;from January onwards - and askedfor by those on the spot, and who were therefore in the best position to judge of &quot;the need of them - or to support wholehearted!?; and in time for decisive results to be achieved beforethe weather broke, either Estonians or Russians.(c) Their failure to give any sort of definite pronouncementas to whether, or not, and in what degree, the Independence ofEstonia was to he hoped for by that Mation - and from results,and trend of events/it has seemed to me throughout the year thatthe;wrong sort of fianaaa Russians have had the&quot;ear of theAllied Governments and Councils,57.- The atmosphere of the Negotiations now going on between theEstonians and &quot;the Bolshevics at Dorpat is that the Bolshevics are anxious to secure the Neutrality of the Finnish Gulf, and thereby anamelioration of the Blockade conditions, i.e., that Allied WarVessels should not enter Petrograd Bay.In return for this they are prepared to destroy their wholefleet, and probably to also&apos; submit to controlled Imports of Loco-motives, Machinery and foodstuffs, and to exclude War Material,58.- It is probable that the French and Americans may not agree tothis - but,&quot;as neither of these Nations has taken any hand incontaining the Bolshevic fleet during the past year,&apos;&apos; I do notconsider that they have a right to interfere with, - or question -any decision that the British Government may come to regarding thedisposal of that Fleet.59.- The Bolshevics put forward alternatives - such as selling thisFleet to the British&quot; Government - interning H ht British Ports -oi% being; allowed to remove it to &quot;/ladivostock.      I couldnot.

A.Sir,I have the honour to report having been engaged with    iBolshevic Forces on the 18th May.2.-   I had, since the 15th May, been patrolling and lyingoff Seskar Island, whilst the Estonians ware&apos; landing troops and operating against the Bolshevics in Louga and Kaporskaya Bight3;so as to prevent Bolshevic interference with these operations.3.-   On the morning of the 18th May, I was lying to the eastward of Seskar Island with &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, talker&quot; and &quot;Scout&quot;ob&amp;^rving the entrance to Petrograd Bay in which there had been agood deal of smoke the day before and early on^ this morning.4.-   At 0845 the Fore Top reported craft coming out to the westward past Grey Horse Fort and keeping under the land, (GreyHorse Fort had at this time a Kite Balloon up). I weighed andremained stopped so that these craft should not see me againstthe land, and hoping that they would stand on clear of and beyondthe minefields. The S3tonian vessels were at this time moving out to the Westward.5.-   When the Bolshevic craft (five in number), led by alarge Destroyer of the &quot;Avtroil&quot; type got out as far as the Dolgoittos, five miles clear of the Petrograd minefields and still closeunder the land, they turned back, so I went ahead full speed onan Easterly course, closing the range rapidly from. 20,000 to 16,000yards when fire was opened, the Bolshevic Destroyer, flying a verylarge Red Flag, firing the first shot.I stood on, on this easterly course, till half a mile from themined area, passing two miles to the Northward of the unmarkedDiamond Bank Shoal, the range then being 12,000 yards, then turned to the Southward passing one and half miles Hast of the DiamondBank Shoal, and eased to twenty knots, closing the range to 10,000yards, then turned together to East, then to Forth and North NorthWest easing to ten knots as by that time the range was openingand we were a mile within the mined area.The Grey Horse Battery was also at.this time firing 12&quot;guns at us.6.-   The speedThe C0MMAN DSR- I1T - CHIEF,ATLANTIC AO HOME FLEETS.gncloBure 2jTo*l to Baltic Letter No.$SO dated 31st December 1919.

One good hit at any rate was observed.7.-   Under the circumstances. I did not consider it advisable to run in over the minefields, and under the guns of the Grey HorseFort,  in order to obtain a decision and so these craft made goodtheir escape,8.-   To the Eastward,- but not taking part in the, action, was.&apos;athree funnelled Cruiser, possibly the &quot;Oleg&quot;^and to the Eastwardof her again was smoke,&apos;and the Estonians reported that theBolshevic Battleship &quot;petropavlosk&quot; was also out.9.-   The fire from the Bolshevic Destroyer was fairly steadilymaintained, but ineffective; the other craft appeared to heminesweepers.10.-   I remained off the Bay until all were out of sight to theKastward, then closed the Estonian ships, discussed matters with admiral Pitka then anchored for the night.11.-   A Track Chart is enclosed.I have the honour to be.Sir,Your obedient Servant,(sgd) WALTER COWAN.KSAR ADMIRAL COl&amp;IANDINGFIRST LIGHT CRUISER SQUADRON.(83HI0R NAVAL OFFICER, BALTIC).

The Destroyer was engaged by &quot;Walker&quot; at about 3,000 yards and chased Eastwards, the Battleship opening a heavy and well controlled fire at the same time.3,-   On the fir^t report, I weighed and steamed east at 25knots, a Bolshevic aeroplane appearing overhead and dropping bombsamong my force as we advanced,&apos;but it flew off eastwards on beingfired at. The Destroyer fell back on the Battleship, whichmanoeuvred on a North West and South Easterly course behind theminefields, and kept up a heavy and well disciplined fire on&quot;Walker&quot; as she fell back to meet me, the Tort having a Kite Balloonup and firing also. I stood up and down the edge of the minefieldsbut the Bolshevic Force showed no intentions of coming on andretired eastwards after a fe\- salvoes had been fired.4.-   Submarine &quot;L.15&quot; reports having fired two torpedoes atthe Destroyer at a range of 4,000 yards and Submarine &quot;38.27 &quot; one at a range of 4,000 - 6,000 yards. &quot;Walker&quot; wa3 hit twice but no appreciable damage was done - there was one casualty only -Edward Ignaciou3 (hiinn, Able Seaman, O.N. J.51000.5.-   If, as seems likely, their heavy ships intend keepingbehind the Minefields, it seems an ideal opportunity for action by coastal iiiotor Boats and Torpedo Carrying Aeroplanes, as theBolshevic Ship was only attended by one Destroyer and two other small craft, and her speed did not seem to be above 15 knots.6.-   The fact that they are now employing aircraft and thewell-disciplined rapid fire the Bolshevic Battleship kept up, showsthat their Naval efficiency should be taken seriously; the nextdevelopment will probably be the appearance of their submarines.The Destroyer, I judged, reached a speed of well over 25 knots.I have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servant,THE SECRETARY OF THE ADMIRALTY (Sgd) WALTER COWAN.THE COIvDvlANDER- IN- CHIEF ,ATLANTIC FLEET.
