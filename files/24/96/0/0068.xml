9 4 0  1. dSBCR3T.CP. 458   . WBIIH,. &quot;Tits   CENOTAPH&quot;.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.How that the work -of replacing the temporary Cenotaphin Whitehall by a permanent replica is actually, in hand, I wishto call the attention cf my colleagues to the rumour that anattempt is being made to reproduce the national flags which nowdecorate the structure in carved and dyed Portland st-jne .Anything.less calculated to inspire reverence or emotion thana petrified and raddled imitation of free and living bunting,which responds to every breeze and mcod of nature, it is diffi-cult to imagine, whilst one can easily foresee what its colourswill be reduced tc after one *r two winters of London grime and fog.It lias &quot;been suggested, I &quot;believe, that in no other waycould the flags be made &quot;permanent&quot;.    But is it necessary crdesirable that they should be?     The staffs could be as permanentas desired, but surely the bunting could be renewed,  once amonth if need be, at quite insignificant cost.I am aware that Sir Edwin Lutyens originally favoured the idea of experimenting with dyed stone, but I discussed thematter with him before he left for India and. he told me that hewould, be quite content to have real and renewable flags    .- - -affixed to the permanent structure if they were consideredpreferable.The cult of &quot;Strawberry Hill Gothic&quot; demanded that-every material should be outraged to represent something different;thus stucco was made to imitate wallpaper, wallpaper to imitatestucco, and metal coal-scuttles to resemble the stone capitals ofcathedral columns.     I venture to plead that our national flagmay be spared from any such misplaced ingenuity - which&apos;, in the.
special circumstances, would be almost an act of sacrilege.In any case the War Cabinet definitely decided (T7.c.634, Minute6) that the Cenotaph was to be reproduced without any avoidable4alteration. If the Office of Works desires that this decision should be varied, I claim that it should be referred back tothe Cabineb.L of P.19th January, 1920.
