MURRAY for permission TO PUBLISH HIS DESPATCH OF 28thJUNE, 1917.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR.1. General Sir A. J. Murray, formerly General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,_121Egyptian Expeditionary Force, has applied for permission to make use of, for purposes Meditof publication, his original despatch from Egypt, dated 28th June, 1917.2. The despatch in question began with a section dealing with alleged changes ofpolicy by the War Cabinet, and this is printed as an appendix to this Memorandum.In view of its nature, Lord Derby, then Secretary of State for War, asked for thedirection of the Cabinet in regard to its publication, and the War Cabinet decided, on17th August, 1917 (W.C. 217 (18)), that &quot;in any case the first part of the despatch,dealing with policy, could not be published.&quot;The despatch was, accordingly, published without the section.3. There are also certain appendices to the despatch containing accounts of thewater supply, transport and labour arrangements for the campaign. They were omittedwhen the despatch was published on the grounds that they would convey informationof value to the enemy.4. Sir A. Murray, at the time, asked that a note should be prefixed to thedespatch, when published, that it had been abbreviated because the original mightconvey valuable information to the enemy. It was decided, however, that as it wasnot in accordance with precedent, or the principles laid down for the compilation and publication of despatches, the request could not be granted.5. Sir A. Murray again asked, on 20th October, 1918, that his despatch should bepublished in its original form, but the Army Council were not prepared to republishthe despatch in any form.6. Sir A. Murray was informed on 11th December last that sanction could notbe given for the publication of the first paragraph in any circumstances and he nowenquires the reasons of this refusal. The decision not to make public the despatch inits original form rested on two grounds, the one political, the other military, and the objection on the latter ground is now obsolete.7. In view of the previous reference to the War Cabinet, I now ask for Cabinetdirection as to whether permission is to be given to Sir A. Murray to publish the first^section of his despatch of 28th June, 1917.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.s-The War Office,17 th January, 1920.
APPENDIXFirst section of General Sir A. J. Murray&apos;s despatch, dated 28th June, 1917..1. Before entering into a detailed account of the operations during this period, themain events of which were the enemy&apos;s voluntary retirement from his position atWeli Sheikh Nuran and the two battles in front of Gaza, I think it necessary to pointout that the policy of the War Cabinet, as communicated to me in instructions from theWar Office, underwent several changes between the end of 1916 and April, 1917.   in w.o. letter   October, 1916, I was informed that the policy in Egypt was to be mainly defensive,4^10 le1&apos;    though it was hoped that all preparations were being made for an advance on El Arish.My letter,    With this policy, including the plan of occupying, if possible, El Arish, I agreed, though no. G-.s.z./  I stated at the same time that my previous estimate of the number of troops necessary.21. lb. 16.    for holding and operating from El Arish namely, five divisions and at least fourmounted brigades still held good, but that with the four divisions then at my disposal,the 42nd, 52nd, 53rd, and 54th, I was prepared to defend Egypt and undertake the advance on El Arish.   This advance, as I reported in my despatch of 1st March,1917, was successfully accomplished by the end of December.w.o. tele- Meanwhile, early in the month of December, I was asked by telegram to send mylem, ripher proposals for action beyond El Arish, and to state the additional troops which I should9.12.16.    &apos; require to carry them out; and it was pointed out to me that the gaining of a military -My telegram, success in this theatre was very desirable.   In my reply I asked that two divisionsi38oA&apos;M&apos;    might be sent to me, and, if possible, some more mounted troops.   A further telegramio.i2.i6.    was sent to me on 12th December, instructing me to make the maximum effort possiblew.o. tele-   during the winter, and inquiring when the two divisions for which I had asked would26289^her ^e squired.   I replied that, while I was prepared to attempt the advance to Bafa with12.12.16.   &apos; only four divisions, I considered that one additional division was now necessary toMy tele.     ensure security and to hold, and operate from, El Arish thus once more repeating mya&apos;Il&apos;1389,   original estimate that five divisions would be required for this purpose and thatis. 12. i6.    another division would be needed, not before 15th February, for a further advance fromnJgITz/   ^&apos;a^a towards Palestine.   At the same time I forwarded in detail the plan on which I33/i,  &apos;     have since worked for my further advance along the sea coast into Palestine.   The nexti3.i2.i6.    communication which I received (dated 15th December) indicated that the War Cabinetgram No     were not   prepared to give me the troops asked for.   I was informed that, notwith-26624, cipher, standing recent instructions to make the maximum effort possible during the winter,15.12.16.    my primary mission was the defence of Egypt, and that I should be notified if andwhen the War Cabinet changed this policy.   I was further informed that no moremounted troops could be sent, and that the possibility of my getting two more divisionsdepended on whether they could be released from another theatre of war.   No furtherindications of policy were given me till after the occupation of El Arish, but early inJanuary it appeared that the War Cabinet had decided to make everything subsidiarywo. &apos;ele-   to the concentration of strong forces in France.   A telegram of 11th January informedfmi, cipher, me that the War Cabinet had decided that, as the general situation would not permitn.1.17.     of sending out the reinforcements for which I had asked, the undertaking of anyoperations in Palestine on a large scale should be postponed until the autumn, and that,while preparing for this campaign during the summer, I was to be ready to release onew.o.the-    0!. tw0 divisions for France.   A few days later definite instructions arrived to send a28V97, cipher, division to France, acting on which I withdrew the 42nd Division then the best in my22.1.17.     force forthwith, and it sailed early in March.   This indication of a changed policy was$ous/isf81&apos;&apos; connrmed by a letter of 11th January, in which I was informed of the acceptance byiLi.17.&apos;    the War Cabinet in principle of an autumn campaign in Palestine and instructed that my letter,    my primary mission after the occupation of Rafa was the defence of Egypt during the33/1 f S      summer months and the preparation for an offensive campaign in the autumn.   In reply30.1.17.     to this, I again stated that I adhered to my estimate of the need of five divisions tosafeguard Egypt, hold El Arish and protect the Suez Canal.Between the end of January and the end of March, though I was now reduced to three infantry divisions, I made every effort as far as possible to keep up the offensive.Owing to the satisfactory state of affairs in the Canal defences and in the West, I was now able to employ all three of my divisions on the Eastern front, to- concentrate all my mounted troops in two mounted divisions, and to commence the formation of the74th Division from the dismounted Yeomanry brigades in the force. Several months,however, were bound to elapse before this division could be completely equipped,efficiently trained and supplied with its full complement of divisional troops. Early inMarch, to my disappointment, the enemy, whom I had every hope of successfully
attacking in his position at Weli Sheikh Nuran, evacuated this position before our troops were within reach of him. It was to prevent a repetition of these tactics and tobring the Turks to fight that I determined to attack the Gaza position as soon aspossible, considering that the advantage of thus exerting pressure on the enemy andpossibly taking Gaza by a coup de main would outweigh the risk of making the attack in a waterless country considerably in advance of railhead.Though the coup dc main just failed, the military results of the first battle ofGaza, in my opinion, justified my anticipations.   The enemy was brought to fight,losing heavily in killed and wounded, and the advance of the railway to Wadi Ghuzzewas assured.   It was at this time, the end of March, when the hitherto adversesituation in Mesopotamia was rapidly changing in our favour, that the War cabinet again changed the policy in this theatre.   In a telegraphic communication, dated ,30th w\o. tele-March, I was instructed, in view of the altered situation, to make my object the defeat timi, cipher,of the Turks south of Jerusalem and the occupation of Jerusalem.   I replied, drawing 30-3-attention once more to my never-varying estimate of the troops required, that a rapid My telegram. advance could not be expected unless I were fortunate enough to inflict a severe blow ^10,^&quot;r7&quot;1749&apos;on the enemy, and that heavy fighting with considerable losses would have to beexpected if the Turks held, as I anticipated, a series of strong positions between theGaza Bir Saba and the Jerusalem Jaffa line.   After consideration of this reply bythe War Cabinet, I was informed that the War Cabinet relied on me to pursue the W.O. tele-enemy with all the rapidity compatible with the necessary progress of my communica- f^&apos; f^er,tions, and was anxious that I should push my operations with all energy, though at the 1.4.17, No.same time no additional troops were to be sent to me, since it was considered that, in ^^^piier,view of the military situation of the enemy, my present force would suffice.   At thattime, as always, I had fully appreciated the importance of offensive operations in this theatre, and, having failed to take Gaza by a coup de main, I was anxious to take it,if possible, by more deliberate operations before the enemy was further reinforced,chiefly on account of its water supply.   I was therefore ready, as I stated at the time,to attack Gaza with my present force before the end of April, and had good hopes,provided the enemy was not heavily reinforced, of capturing that town.The second battle of Gaza took place between the 17th and 20th April. Isucceeded in pushing on to Avithin a mile or two of the town, but was unable to takethe key of the position, Ali Muntar. The enemy force in front of me was then five divisions, with considerably increased numbers of Austrian and German gunners and machine gunners, and it was abundantly clear that, owing to the relaxation of pressurefurther east, the Turks had been able to reinforce their units heavily from depots in thenorth of Palestine.When, therefore, after the second battle of Gaza, I was asked to state my require- w.o.ments for a continuation of the offensive, I replied that my estimate of five fully ^0^33191equipped and complete divisions still held good, whereas at present I had only three cipher,considerably depleted by recent fighting, one just formed and incompletely trained, and21&apos;4&apos;17,six battalions the majority far from fit towards the formation of a fifth division.  My NJ oUlT^&apos;requirements therefore Avere two complete divisions and enough field artillery to22-4.17.complete all divisions to normal scale.   With the troops which I had at the time I could hope for no more than a local success.   In view of this position and the inability of the prussian Army in the Caucasus to relieve the pressure, the War Cabinet decided to change the policy, and at the end of April I .\vas informed that Jerusalem was no longer w.&apos;o.my objective, but that my mission for the present was to take favourable opportunity of ^eggg^&apos;4defeating the Turkish forces opposed to me and to follow up any success gained with all cipher,the means at my disposal.   To this task I devoted my energies throughout the month25,417,of May, during which time I was engaged in broadening my front by laying downbranch railway and pipe lines from Rafa eastwards and south-eastwards to the WadiGhuzze, so that I might eventually effectually threaten Bir Saba and the railway north of that place.   Thanks to the unremitting labour of all concerned, in spite of immensedifficulties, these preparations are iioav well advanced, and we are now in a position totake the offensive in any part of the line from Gaza to Bir Saba. though the date of the offensive must depend upon&apos;when my deficit of about 9,000 infantry can be made goodby drafts, and when reinforcements can arrive from Salonika.It aa7ou1c1 be of interest, as this is my last despatch, to review shortly here bow theEgyptian Expeditionary Force has varied in strength between the beginning of 1916 andthe present time. ,At the end of January, 1916, besides a small portion of the 46th Division, therewere in Egypt, either in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force or in the Force in Egypt,the Australian and NeAV Zealand Mounted Division, three mounted Yeomanry brigades,
-the Imperial, Service Cavalry Brigade and three double companies, Bikanir Camel Corps,,.11 infantry divisions (including the Australian and New Zealand troops), one Indian-infantry division, three dismounted Yeomanry brigades, two Territorial infantry brigades,,two brigades of 60-prs. and the equivalent of three brigades of siege artillery, besidesgarrison battalions and other minor units. The South African Infantry Brigade-subsequently arrived in this country.Between this time and the end of May, 1916, six complete divisions at full strength,three infantry brigades and nine batteries of heavy and siege artillery, besides certain...signal, engineer and medical units, were embarked for service in other theatres.Meanwhile, the 4th and 5th Australian Divisions had been formed, the dismountedYeomanry organized in four brigades, six companies of the Imperial Camel Corps raised and trained and the Camel Transport Corps raised to a strength of 18,000. So that inMay the Force in Egypt having now been amalgamated with the Egyptian ExpeditionaryForce, the following were the principal components of the force: One mounteddivision, three mounted Yeomanry brigades, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade (less -one regiment), six companies Imperial Camel Corps, six companies Bikanir Camel Corps,seven infantry divisions, four dismounted brigades, seven battalions of Indian infantry,three batteries of 60-prs.During June and July, 1916, the 4th and 5th Australian Divisions, and the11th Division, embarked for France, thus bringing the total number of troops sent out ofthe country since January to 232,000, not including medical units. Between this timeand the end of February, 1917, no material change took place in the composition of theEgyptian Expeditionary Force, save that three further companies, Bikanir Camel Corps,arrived ; additional companies of the Camel Corps were raised (the total number of companies is now 18), the Camel Transport Corps was also considerably increased, andthe Egyptian Labour Corps, the recruitment of which had begun early in .1.916, had.reached a total of nearly 50,000.During the period covered by this report the 42nd Division has sailed for France,the 74th Division has been formed from three of the dismounted brigades (one havingbeen previously disbanded), with the necessary divisional troops; the 75th Division hasbeen formed from battalions that have arrived from India and elsewhere and Indianinfantry battalions. The arrival of an additional mounted brigade from Salonika has enabled me to reorganize my mounted troops into three mounted divisions, each of threemounted brigades. One more mounted brigade and the 60th Division are in process of arrival from Salonika, and reinforcements of heavy artillery (some of which have alreadyarrived) are en route. So that at the present the composition of the EgyptianExpeditionary Force, allowing for reorganization now actually in progress, is: Threemounted divisions (each of three brigades), four infantry divisions, one further infantry division in process of formation and one division en route, 18 companies Imperial CamelCorps, nine companies Bikanir Camel Corps, with a tenth now in process of formation;.six batteries of 60-prs., two siege batteries and a prospective total of 7\ siegebatteries of heavy howitzers. In other words, the present fighting units of theEgyptian Expeditionary Force, when all advised reinforcements &quot;have arrived, will formthe equivalent of one cavalry corps and two infantry corps, with the necessary artillery.Having thus summarized these main developments of policy and variations of strength, I now proceed to the more detailed narrative.
