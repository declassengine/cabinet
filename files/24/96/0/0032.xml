Tills Document is the Property otCirculated by the Secretary- of State for India. r,,:, -,HE TURKISH PEACE.I CIECUL^PE in the extracts below some of the evidence I have received asto the probable effect on Indian opinion of a Turkish settlement which will be regardedas unfavourable by Mohammedans.E. IS. M.i)th January, 1920.1. Memorandum by Sir Hamilton Grant, Foreign Secretary to the Governmentof India, dated December &apos;20, 1918.As I may be unable to attend the next meeting of the Eastern Committee, i venture to submit the following note on the future of Constantinople. This question,I must mention, has not been fully or finally considered by the Government of India,and the following views, though I believe they represent generally the views of theGovernment of India, are not to be regarded as the considered opinion of thatGovernment.So far as India is concerned, the future of Constantinople is a question of the first importance, as affecting Moslem feeling not only in India itself but in the surroundingcountries of Afghanistan, Persia, Turkestan, &amp;c. There is no doubt that the Moslemcommunity especially of course the more educated classes-are profoundly anxiousregarding the future of the Turkish Capital. Throughout the war our Moslemsubjects have behaved extraordinarily well considering all things. They accepted thefact that the war was in no sense a religious war ; that Turkey had foolishly beendragged into it against us; and now they realise that Turkey must pay the price ofher folly. Their one hope, however, is that the price will not be too high. They stilllook on the Sultan as their Khalif; they still regard Constantinople as the nucleus ofthe Faith; they still admit the spiritual sovereignty of the Ottoman. They will accept, sorrowfully but without lasting rancour, the severance of Arabia and Armeniafrom the Turkish Empire as part of the penalty due. But they will not accept in thesame spirit the expulsion of the Turk from his European Capital. They will not onlyresent this as a political catastrophe, but they will construe it as a clear indication thatthe struggle has after all, and in spite of our protestations, been between the Cross andthe Crescent; and that our real policy all the time has been to blot out Islam from the face of the world. The feelings so engendered will be a heritage of hate against us tobe passed on from Moslem father to Moslem son-and there may be a reawakening ofthe Pan-Islamic spirit such as might seriously embarrass the Great Moslem Powers,particularly ourselves. In India the Moslem will be driven into the arms of the hindus; and the cleavage which now makes our administration there comparativelysimple may give place to a formidable union.On political grounds, therefore, there are grave objections to the expulsion of theTurks from Constantinople, and on sentimental and equitable grounds there arereasons for dealing generously in this matter. We owe a good deal to our Moslemsduring the war, not only for what they have done, but also for what they haveabstained from doing. They are a worthy community on the whole, though sore at-present, and easily won back by considerate treatment. If they could be made tounderstand that the Great Moslem Powers, particularly ourselves, had, in deference tothe feelings of our Moslem subjects, agreed to the retention of Constantinople by theTurks, we should regain the trust and confidence of our Moslem subjects to a verylarge extent.Further, if in the future we could establish close relations with Turkey, chastenedand reduced, but with her Capital still intact, we should establish a formidable Moslembarrier against the attempt of any European Power to move tow ;ds India. Constanti-nople in the hands of any European Power might prove the focuci of trouble for us inthe East once more. If Greece, for instance, have it, what guarantee have we thatGreece may not hereafter prove the tool to some greater Power or group of Powersdesirous of disturbing our great Eastern dependencies ? The same objection would notdoubtless apply to an internationalised Constantinople.    But what do we gain byi.o.  693   100  1/20  f.o.p.   [1942] b
internationalising Constantinople, except further to damage Turkey, whose punishmentwill surely be sufficient if we dock her of all the territories proposed ? Does Turkeydeserve heavier punishment than Germany ? And if she gets it, is it not merely because she is weaker ?2. Private Telegram from the Viceroy, dated 23rd March, 1919.The prospect of the dismemberment of Turkey naturally continues to excite thesusceptibilities of Indian Mohammedans^ though so far violent utterances are confined to Extremist leaders who would like to stir up unyielding fanaticism.It is obviously most important that we should know confidentially as early aspossible the broad lines on which Peace terms with Turkey are likely to be cast, so thatwe may know what to expect.   Propaganda may have to be considered specially.If there should be anything in the settlement for which the British government can take credit vis-a-vis our Mohammedans, you will doubtless see that the opportunityis not wasted.3. Private Telegram from the Viceroy, dated 30tli April, 1919.Everyone to whom I have shown confidentially your* minutes on the position ofTurkey regards them as admirable. Is it possible to allow us to publish the gist ofthem ? I realise the difficulty of this, but it would give great satisfaction if we could show Moslems that their case was strongly represented.*(P. 91 and W.C..P. 660.)4. Official Telegram from the Government of India, dated 3rd May, 1919.Probably most serious element in existing political situation is anxiety and alarmamong Mohammedans as to Peace terms with Turkey. This was largely responsible forMohammedans taking part in recent risings in Punjab, and we have further evidenceof it in reports from various quarters and in public press. We have also just receivedpassionate letter from Mohammed Ali, reciting at length wrongs alleged to have beendone by British Government to Moslems, making widest demands for restoration to turkey of all occupied territories and Egypt, and declaring finally that this Govern-ment has no claim on the allegiance of good Mohammedans, who must declare a Jehador perform Hijrat. We know that this letter is already in surreptitious circulation andthe publication must be expected. The effect on inflammable material of such amanifesto, cleverly worded and making question purely religious one, may be very serious.On all grounds it is essential to deal with situation at once, and we are instructingLocal Governments urgently to use every effort to steady Mohammedan opinion. Ourendeavours, however, are terribly handicapped by want of information about theforthcoming conditions of peace with Turkey. Whatever the difficulties in the wayof confidential communication to us we must press for these to be overcome. Moham-medan opinion in India as a whole is utterly unprepared for terms such as we ourselvesexpect. It anticipates that Great Britain, having defeated Turkey in the war, will deal generously with her as a disarmed opponent, and it does not realise either the limited voice which our representatives have at the settlement, or the force of opinion which Turkey&apos;s misconduct has aroused against her in the world at large. Without somepreparation, such as we are not in a position to make so long as we are ignorant, as, proposed, the Peace terms may come as a bombshell to our Moslems, with consequences of a very grave kind. We urge on you earnestly therefore that you forecast at once and communicate to us the most accurate estimate you can of the Peace terms so far asthey concern Turkey, and the probable date of their publication, and give us discretion to communicate them confidentially to Local Governments for use under our directionsand as circumstances dictate. We do not know if it is still possible to affect the termsthemselves, but any arrangement by which Constantinople, the Holy Places or newterritories occupied by British, could be placed under nominal suzerainty of turkey would have a good effect in appeasing Moslem sentiment. This would be particularlyvaluable in connection with Holy Places or Constantinople, even if no other concessionis feasible. You will remember also that we have suggested that decision as toKhalifate should be purely one for the Mohammedans themselves. We desire also to publish, though without referring to details, the fact that you and the Indiandelegates have made every effort to obtain lenient terms for Turkey, and we should beglad to know how far His Majesty&apos;s Government were able to support these representations.
5. Official Telegram from the Government of India, dated ISth Ma;/, 1919.Continuation of Home Department telegram dated the 3rd May. Advices fromBengal, Hyderabad, and Bhopal, confirm our previous information as to the serious effect of Peace terms in relation to Turkey, and render it essential that we should beable to publish official statement showing in detail what efforts representatives ofGreat Britain, not merely Indian representatives, made to secure lenient terms for turkey. Mohammedan opinion will not be satisfied with account of Indian delegates&apos;,measures, though official detailed statement of these should also be sent for pub-lication. In any case Indian delegation is looked on as subsidiary, while our Moslemsregard Great Britain as the vanquisher of Turkey and in a position to dictate theterms to be imposed on her, and also by reason of its large Moslem population asunder an obligation to safeguard Moslem interests.Moslem feeling already deeply stirred. Educated opinion probably prepared forextension of territorial losses, but not for loss of Constantinople, especially in view ofpronouncements by the Premier and Lord Robert Cecil. Still less are they preparedfor total extinction as nation or preservation of a fragment under mandatory.Great mass of people probably expects Turkey to be treated easily and again admitted to British friendship and protection.We would impress upon you the necessity for an official communication of theattitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government. If Turkeys fate approximated to worseanticipations we warn you that the results may be very grave. You know Indianoi union at the present time is unusually excited and adversely affected : partly owing tostrain of war and high prices, partly to world wide disturbances of public opinion, andverv largely to persistent and virulent campaign of misinterpretation under the guiseof constitutional agitation which has had the worst possible effect in poisoning mindsagainst Government and Europeans. Already Hindu intrigue has successfullyexploited Mohammedan soreness, and the results are to be seen in the Punjab,Bombay, and Calcutta disorders. Now we have war on the frontier waged by aMohammedan Kingdom and proclaimed by the Amir as Jehad. At present India isfrightened by the prospect of invasion and disposed to sink grievances and stand byauthority. But if hostilities are prolonged we cannot say how the additional blowof Turkey&apos;s ruin may affect our Moslems including those in the army, and anyreverse would make the position still more serious. We have informed you thatMohammed Ali is advocating Hijrat as the only possible alternative to Jehad.Shaukat Ali is using his influence to dissuade a section of Mussulmans from assisting the Government against Afghanistan and clearly hints at Jehad as a duty. We donot think stable Mohammedan opinion will accept these counsels, but it will be verysorely tried by the Peace terms and may find it difficult to resist religious appealssufficiently to restrain the masses. Spectacle of Turkey completely dismembered byChristian Powers may conceivably make Moslems turn to the Amir as waging Jehadon behalf of Islam. A Mohammedan religious rising is a contingency not to be ruled out of account.Therefore with no alarmist purpose, but as a measure of prudence, we press upon HisMajesty&apos;s Government the extreme expediency of proving that the British Governmenthas done its best for Turkey. A categorical statement of efforts made and results achieved is needed.   The points about which the deepest concern is felt are : (1.) However small the area left to Turkey, the Sultan should remain anindependent sovereign, any dependence on another Power being inconsistent with his position as Khalif.(2.) He should retain some suzerainty, however nominal, over the Holy Places, ifnot over Arabia, Mesopotamia and Palestine. We know how difficult ofattainment this is in view of pledges, but we feel bound to place Moslemfeeling upon this point before you.(3.) His seat should remain in Constantinople even though this is unfortified. Wehave clear evidence that complete subjection of the Sultan to a mandatorycould not be accepted by our Moslems as consistent with these objects. Itmust be remembered that these considerations apply not only to India butto all Mohammedan countries in Asia whose retrogression from GreatBritain must be affected in a like manner. We are anxious to show Moslemopinion that in spite of Turkey&apos;s conduct the British Government did itsutmost to refrain from participation in the supposed anti-Moslem campaign.Above all it is necessary to prove to Indian Moslems that the KingEmperor&apos;s Government made determined effort on behalf of his Moslemsubjects.[1942] . - B 2
tg. Extract from Private Letter from the Viceroy to the Secretary of State,   ,dated 2nd July, 1919.As I have told you before, we have, through the Local Governments, preparedleading Moslems throughout India for the worst, and, if it eventuates that the Turksshould be left in nominal control of Constantinople, it will be a very great relief, notonly to us who have to bear the burden of responsibility, but to Moslems throughout India.7. Private Telegram from the Viceroy, dated 28th July, 1919.Turkish Peace terms. I am grateful for your appreciation of what we have donehere. On our part we fully appreciate all that you and the Indian Delegacion havedone on behalf of the Mohammedan cause. I quite realise that it may be some weeksyet before the Peace terms are finally settled, and I note what you say about thepossibility of saving Constantinople. I am of course saying nothing about this, although I fervently hope that your anticipations will be realised. The present position so far asit can be gauged is that our Mohammedans w-re a month or two ago prepared for, ifnot reconciled to, the worst. The lapse of time has at least in some quarters raised orrevived hopes which can have no chance of being fulfilled. Although therefore any material mitigation of the terms originally forecast will be accounted unto us forrighteousness, it would be the gravest mistake to arouse or encourage expectations asto fulfilment of which there is the least doubt. I believe it to be more or less commonknowledge out here that you and the Indian Delegation, as well as my Government,have done everything they could on behalf of the Mohammedan cause.8. Private Telegram from the Viceroy, dated 12th December, 1919.Anything that can be done to make the Sultan&apos;s status in Constantinople asdignified and favourable as possible will be useful.9. Note by Mr. C. C. Garbett, I.G.S. (Punjab), and lately of the Civil Administrationof Mesopotamia, dated Jannary, 1920.The position is very different from what it was in December, 1918. There is not an educated Moslem before whom the Turkish point of view has not been set and thecause of his religion pleaded. His interest may have been recently awakened; it isnone the less deep.That many Moslems fought the Turk does not show that they were indifferent tothe fate of Constantinople and the Sultan. They admitted that the Turk deservedpunishment; but they were able to detach in their mind the agents of Government the average Turk is a bad Mohammedan from their spiritual leader, the Khalif, theguardian of the Holy Places, a fact which was remarkable to anyone visiting Najd orKerbala in company with Indian Moslems.They have always looked to us not to interfere in matters religious. It is now in contemplation to take away their Holy Places and destroy the sovereignty of the onlyremaining Moslem Power. I cannot see how the Indian official can find an explanationthat will satisfy his Indian enquirers. I consider that not only will the confidence ofthe Moslems be lost, but that active resentment will take its place; and with all the elements of disorder that are now loose in the East to tempt him, I would anticipateopen rebellion as soon as the first opportunity serves.10. Note by Sir George Roos-Keppel, lately Chief Commissioner of the North-EastFrontier Province, dated January, 1920.I left India in September last, coming home from a Mohammedan province wherethe main topic of conversation and interest was the fate of Turkey. On my way toBombay, and in Bombay, I met many Indians, all of whom discussed this topic with me with every sign of interest.I formed the opinion that any settlement of the Turkish question which wouldpublicly humiliate the Turk would be most bitterly resented and would be looked upon as a personal grievance by every thinking Indian Mussulman.Since my return I have had letters from many friends in India Indian and european and from them I gather that the Turkish settlement is awaited with thekeenest interest and anxiety by both Mohammedans and Hindus, by the latter becausethey hope that the decision adverse to the claims of Turkey will throw the Indian
oMussulmans into the arms of the Hindus in Indian politics. Among my correspondentsI may mention Sir Harcourt Butler and Sir Abdul Qayum.In the North of India certainly, and probably throughout India, public feeling ismuch stirred, especially among Hindus, by the revelations of the Hunter Committee.The Mussulmans who suffered less than the Hindus have hitherto remained steady, but with a real and popular grievance and cry, they will join the Hindu politicians and theconsequences may be serious.Any harsh treatment of the Turk will produce great bitterness in India; it will be felt from Egypt to Surinan, and will be a powerful weapon in the hands of theBolsheviks; religious questions have little popularity in Afghanistan, but even therethe chance of the Afghans joining the Bolsheviks will be greatly increased if the latterget their war cry.
