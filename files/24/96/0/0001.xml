The recent successes of the Bolsheviks in South Russiahave profoundly changed the situation since the decision wasreached last summer to evacuate the British naval personnel inthe Caspian 3ea*20    Denikinfs prasent situation in the Caspian is serious *He.has lost Tsaritsin and Erasnovo&amp;sk and the Bolshevik9s fleet inthe Volga was reported on December 27th to he only prevented bylack of fuel from coming South.     Denikinfs fleet, which is atPetrovsk, is reported as unsatisfactory end likely to turnBolshevik (vide statement by Colo Stokes in 3?el*254 from Ik,Wardrop Jo3.   At the same time there are indications, according to admirality information, that the Bolsheviks are turning their eyesto the Middle East ana particularly to the Mahommedanpopulation there.We have also assumed responsibility for Persia, whoseinterest in the Caspian is great.4.   British control of the Caspian will be an essential condition of any military operations that may become necessaryfor the defence of Persia,-Mesopotamia or Indian or for theprotection of the Trans-Caucasian Republics if the Bolshevikscontinue their advance southwards.5.    In these circumstances the Admiralty consider that itis of great importance to regain control of the Caspianimmediately.    In their view the quickest and most effective wayto do so is to take over at once as many of Denikin*s ships ashe will agree to turn over and man them wMh British crews fromthe Mediterranean.6,    In view of hie critical situation it is anticipatedthat Denikin may be prepared to accede to this proposal if onlyto save his ships? but for the same reason the Admiralty considerthat the matter will have to be carried through at once? if it isto be done at all.     Hhej therefore consider the question asurgent.7*    If General Denikin is either raritiling or unable to handover his ships, the Admiralty would be prepared tc put forwardalternative proposals, which would, however, require time to putinto effect.It is to be understood that any proposals for the Navalcontrol of the Caspian are dependent on the use of Baku as abase.     No other port has the necessary facilities orcommunicationsc     This entails military occupation of Baku byBritish troops.(Signed)..  BBATTI.! 6. 1. 20.I or wardedW.H.L.
