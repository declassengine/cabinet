On the contrary, there has never beona time within the last nine months when the extremists were soill equipped to bring about a sudden ooup a.&apos;state.   It is truethat the great mass of the people, including ex-soldiers and members of the lower middle class upon whom high prices are pressing heavily, is discontented and angry with the Government,and inclined to favour any charge as being likely to be betterthan the present situation.   But the minority that would liketo see a sudden and violent revolution is ridiculously small.The tendency is all towards a desire for a General Election inorder that labour candidates may be returned.The railway settlement has stabilised the labour worldfor the moment, but the men are by no means satisfied.   Theywill probably remain quiet until direct action is called forin one of the other big Unions.   The opinions of labour leaderson/
on the settlement are given in this report, together with thenew movement on the railways for &quot;working to Rule Book,&quot;It is not yot possible to judge what&apos;effect Jthe partialresumption of trade with Russia will have, but the announoemenhas &quot;been well received by Labour,Special attention is oalled to the secret negotiations noproceeding on the Continent between adherents of the ThirdMoscow International,   British subjects are taking part in itand there is an intention to transform the British SocialistParty into the &quot;Communist Party&quot;.   The money has beenfurnished by Theodore Rothstein, a Russian Jew journalistformerly employed in the War Office: he is believed to havereceived it by courier from Moscow,   Quotations are given from a letter written by Lenin to a British Communist, inwhich he declares that the cause of Communism will be bestserved by using the parliamentary machine.- The flow of Bolshevik propaganda,which is very ablywritten, will inevitably be greatly increased when trade isopened with Russia, and there is no way of stemming the flowwithout legislation.Appended to this report is a summary of:-&apos;1,    Anti-revolutionary legislation in theUnited States. .S,  &apos; The organisation of loyal citizens during theWinnipeg strike last May,3,    A specimen of what is believed to be an anti-Sinn IPein leaflet, now circulating inNewcastle.
9 4 Ad i aLABOgg IiBADBRS ON THE RAILWAY gggffllThe comments of prominent Trade Unionists on therailway terms aro an instructive indication of the trend of feeling.On. January 18th, Mr, Thomas., M.P., defended thesettlement before a large and hostile audience at Liverpool.He said that a strike would have boon disastrous, butadded:   &quot;Thi3 is not the last word.   You will be able toimprove upon this in the future, If only you have the common-sense to keep united.&quot;On the same day-Mr. Cramp said at Shipley that thesettlement would not remain for all time he sinoerelyhoped that the other side did not rely upon it as apermanent settlement, because if they did, they would receive a very great shock in the future,   3?rom the point of viewof negotiation, the settlement was a very great achievement.Mr. Henderson, M.P., has expressed his opinion asfollows:&quot;I dislike and suspect this-new method of wageagreements governed by a sliding-scale arrangementbased on fluctuating food prices.   It i3 a subtlemethod of stereotyping existing conditions.   In some respects it is a method of side-tracking the workerswhich is much more fatal to the social and industrialideals we have In view than any direct attack by capitalupon the working-class movement,&quot;To allow wages to be governed by food priceBis to rob the wage-earner of every advantage he might hope to set from the concessions wrung from theemployers.   The fluctuations are entirely beyond theworkers1 control and if the trade unionist consents tohave his wages raised or lowered in response to themhe practically makes it impossible to raise wagesabove the existing level.&quot;The trade unions themselves must realise thatthis sort of agreement makes national wage settlementspractically impossible.   It tends to divide the organised working class movement,1 and enables theemployers to fight one section after another in detail,without any ohejice of effective resistance on the part (of the workers.   That means a continual disturbanceof industry by sectional strikes instead of a steady progress in an upward direction.Labour/
*&quot;   -&quot;Labour must realise that there is no hope ofja permanent elevation of the workers1 status onthese terms, jMr, Tom Mann prefers to consider the question from fthe standpoint of food:&quot;I refuse to accept the principle that theworker1s inoome should be regulated by the cost it Itakes to keep him,&quot;It i3 a case of giving the donkey his thistle!with an occasional carrot.   If the owner can knockoff the carrot so much the better for him, and if by chemical treatment he can reduce the thistlesby half, he will do so,&quot;I have heard that practically all theconstituents of proper nutriment for the human body!oan be found in sawdust, and if we accept the the&apos;that wages should properly be on the * fodder basis&apos;!it simply becomes a question of making sawdustsufficiently palatable.   And then sawdust, will be tjdeciding factor in the price to be paid for thelabour of a human being,   Once regulate wages andthe basis of physical maintenance and it requiresno further comment as to the glorious standardsthe workers will soon be permitted to enjoy.. Mr. Bevin of the Dockers1 Union &quot;cannot accept&quot; theterms and says:&quot;I refuse to discuss wages on a fodder basis.Under the syotem of a sliding scale dependent onthe cost of living Labour &quot;is asked to recognise, andby recognition to support, the theory that in relatlto an employer a worker is in the position of ahorse to its ovmer.   Decrease the prico of food andthe cost of keeping both animals will decrease too,To such a theory I cannot assent,&quot;The truth is that the sliding scale system is all to the advantage of the employers.   Theycontrol prices and can afford to smile if Labourwalks into their trap.   And it is not now a questionof meeting one employer or one section of employers;it is a question of meeting all every time.&quot;What Labour has got to recognise is that thepresent wages now paid have no relationship to themeasuro in which wealth has increased.   Those wagesought, in fact, to have been operative in pre-wardays.*&quot;No one ought to accept a method of wagepayment that involves an automatic decrease whenthe cost of living goes down.   That is asking forsectional strikes and breakaways and accusations lythe/
the capitalist Press of broken agreements; forwhenever the reductions become oporative, you may dopend that they will be resisted.&quot;The vicious circle of prices and wages will -be cut whoa Labour utilises its powor of control,&quot;RESTRICTION Og OUTPUTThe policy of restriction of output, popularlyknown as &quot;ca-c&amp;nny&quot;, is boldly advocated in a recentissuo of &quot;Solidarity&quot;&quot;The answer to the &quot;Industrial Efficiency andMore Production&quot; cry lies in an immediate agitationfor a shorter working day, combined with the &apos;intelligent adoption of 1 oa canny1, !go easy&quot;, andother methods of sabotage on the job.   This isvitally necessary for all workers, irrespective of their beliefs as to methods of organisation,their ideas on politics or religion.   The surplusvalue of the capitalist class must be curtailed,for by its every increase the bonds of slaveryarc strengthened,&quot;The effect of this attitude on various industrieshas beon touched on in previous roports, but in view ofthe suggestion made by Mr, Cramp and other railwaymenthat &quot;working to rule book&quot; is preferable to and aseffeotive as a stoppage, an semination of. theapplication of cal canny to the railways is opportune.It may be mentioned that oases have already occurred at Clapham, Edgo Hill, Oarston and Y/olverhampton inrespect of minor grievances.A Standard Book of Rules and Regulations is issuedby all railways for the.guidance of their men; andin most ceses the rules have been formed to prevent are currence of aooidents which have actually happened:nominally they are reasonable and necessary, but inpractice, if oarried out systematically to the letterby all ranks, they would undoubtedly result in delay and/
and congestion throughout the service and eventually ina condition bordering upon chaos at the larger sidingsand goods depots.If the men carry out their duties as laid down,stupidly, with the deliberate intention of causingdifficulties, the vagueness of some of the rules andthe constant use of the words fmust! and 1 shall enablethem to find legitimate excuses for their delaying tacticslRule 23 a/h forbids men to couple waggons, etc.until buffers h;.ve touched, or to go between them until they are at rest.   If this rule were carriedout the delay would be considerable as it means thatengines must slowly push their load till they touohthe other waggons and then hold them there.   a&quot;great deal of time in shunting operations is savedby the practice of the engine giving its load ashort run and then stopping, leaving the vehicles to run forward;&apos; the couplings are caught on the movewith a shunting polo and hooked on to other standingwaggons as they meet, before they have time to partagain.Rule .17 A/]]! stipulates that ever,? man mustobtain and have with him &quot;on duty&quot; certain books and notices.   If by some chance these papers werenot available, a driver, etc., could refuse to take his train out even though working on a local linewhere he v/as well accustomed to the conditions.Rule 67 A. states that signal lamps are to belighted &quot;in&quot;foggy weather or during falling snow&quot;. &apos;Carried out, this would mean considerable delay asRule 99 B (Page 65) states that &quot;oil lamps offixed signals must not be trimmed at signal post3but must be taken to Station, Lamp Room or SignalBox&quot;&quot;and cleaned and trimmed there.   During this work, or even if lamps&quot;were ready and only neededlighting, all signals in the section would be at&quot;danger&quot; holding up traffic, and there is nothing inthe Rales to prevent a signalman doing this for a mere temporary haze or slight snow squall.Rule 109 A/3 states that signals are to be against all traffic on the running line if &quot;by any possibility a crane can project over it.&quot;   This ifinsisted upon could block a line for hours.   If acrane is being used in a way likely to bring any portion of it over a running line the methodusually employed is to send a man some distancedown the line interrupted or likely to beinterrupted to signal the approach of any train;as cranes loaded or unloaded can be &quot;swung clear Infractions of a second little risk to traffic iscaused.Rule/
Rule 113 D,   Vehicles are not to be&apos;moved byprop or pole or towed by an engine, etc, whichmoves on an adjacent line,.  If carried out thiswould increase the engine work in sidings and delaywork,Rule 206 A.   A Guard of Goods train &quot;mustsatisfy himself&quot; before starting that vehiclescomposing his train are properly loaded, marshalled,ooupled, greased anfl sheeted,&quot;have proper number ofbrakes which must be in order, and that the train isin an efficient state, to travel,   as one guard put it, &quot;If I really did that it would take me half aday,&quot;Rule 110,   Horses&apos; heads are to be held duringthe passing of a train.   As trains pass sidings fairlyoften and shunting is continually going on there wouldbe little horse hauling if this rule were obeyed.RHVOLUglO^l^Y TEAGHIKSAttention ha-a frequently been drawn to the increase ofLabour Classes and their pernicious teaohingc   Probablythese arc potentially the most dangerous revolutionaryinstruments at the moment.   During January meetings oftho Peopled League were broken up in l^insbury Park,E?jnmersmith and 3?nlham, their speakers were ridiculedand threatoned -and the &quot;R$$ Flag&quot; and the &quot;International&quot;were sung,Host to the Central Labour College, the LVbourResearch Department seems to be the fountain head of the teaching of class hatred.   fflie Csntral Labour Collegeis starting outside classes at Fort Ro.-&apos;.d, Battersea,Heasden, Hornsey and Commercial Road; Toynbee Hall is.........starting classes for &quot;economics&quot;,   37he Socialist SundaySohools are also doing much harm.   The Manchester&amp; District Labour&apos;College resumed work on January 9th;one week 1a lectures cover the following subjects;Analogies in History* Co-Operative and Social Problems;Labour and Education; Soviets or Parliaments.On the same date a speakers Class was started atthe/
the Socialist Labour party&apos;s headquarters, Glasgow; nofees are charged, the lecturer is Tom Clark, and the clasis arranged by the &quot;Convener of Propaganda&quot;.   At Aberdarea &quot;Proletarian School&quot; ha3 been opened by Tom Anderson;at Bothwell Haugh a new branch of the Socialist LabourParty started a class for Economics within a week offormation; at Coalburn a Study Class is also being organised.The decision to re-open trade with the Russian. Co-operative Societies has been cordially welcomed by mostsections of Labour in this country.   The extremists hope for easier communication and for financial assistance on amuch larger scale than has hitherto been possible, and itis difficult to see how this can be prevented, since thelaw provides no penalty for preaching revolution or for financing revolutionary propaganda.FORMATION OF A NSW COMMONIST PARTYAs indicated in my last Foreign Report, delegates axeproceeding secretly to Holland for a meeting of the Third]Moscow International,   F, Willis has alroady reached Holliand Miss. Sylvia Pankhurst sailed yesterday; a man namedt*.Hodgson is to follow.   It is now believed in Communistoirolea that the secret meeting will be In Copenhagen orHelsingfors.Meanwhile, the plan for forming a new Communist Part,has received a check, because Miss Pankhurst is determineto oppose the formation of any body which contemplatesParliamentary action.   It therefore seems likely thatRUSSIAthe/
the British Sooialist Party will ho made the rallying point for the extremist forces of this country and it is nowpreparing for a propaganda movement in favour of Communism,with the view at the $aster Conference of the Party totransform it into the &quot;Communist Party&quot;.   Appeals are to&quot;be sent out to all the &quot;Left Wing&quot; elements in the IndependentLabour Party, the Sooialist Labour Party and other extremebodies.   The finances are to come from Russian funds whichhave been finding their way into the hands of Lenin1sRussian Jew agent   here.The British Socialist Party intends to organise a bigdemonstration for March 13th to celebrate the founding ofthe Third International.ICBNIWS ADVICE TO INVOLUTIONARIES IN BRITAINThe current issue of &quot;The Socialist&quot; contains a replywritten by Lenin to &quot;a leading English Communist&quot;, whorequested in a letter published in the &quot;KommunisticheskyInternational&quot; advice as to what political action, if my,should be adopted by revolutionary socialists in Brifein whohave affiliated to the Third (Moscow) International.   TheEnglish Communist had apparently objected to the action ofthe Independent Labour Party, British Socialist Party andSocialist Labour Party in running parliamentary candidatesand thereby losing the support &quot;of the revolutionaryIndustrial workers who recognise the necessity of direct0action&quot;:   Lenin replied&quot;The question of Parliamentarism is only a partial,secondary question.&quot;I personally am convinced that a refusal toparticipate in Parliamentary elections is a mistakeon the part of the English revolutionary workers,but it is better to accept this mistake than to postpone the formation of a strong Communist Labour Party in &quot;England/
m     0    &quot;*England among all the elements and groups youenumerate, which sympathise with Bolshevism and aresincere&quot;advocates of a Soviet Republic.   If, forexample, in the ranks of the British SocialistParty there should be found sincere Bolsheviks who,in consequence of a difference of opinion on thequestion of participation in Parliament, should refuse to combine at once&quot;with the other groups to form&apos;a Communist Party, these Bolsheviks, in myopinion, would have committed a blunder a thousandtimes worse than a refusal to participate in an election to a bourgeois Parliament.&quot;The critics of Parliamentarism in Europe and america who belong to the Aaarchists and Syndicalist!-often show themselves in error in so far as theyreject all participation in Parliamentary affairs.In this they simply show their lack of revolutionaryexperience.......   It is the absolute duty of everyworker who wishes to be a revolutionary in practice to assist in the systematic preparation of the masses to this end. ...... Soviet propaganda can and ought to be carried on from within in the bourgeoisParliaments.&quot;If, despite all, any combination of the supporters of Soviet rule was shown to be impossiblejust on account of a difference of opinion on thequestion of Parliamentarism, and only on this account,, then I should regard.the immediate formatiorof two Communist parties, which should work for the transition from bourgeois Parliamentarism to Sovietrule, as a useful step forward.   Though one of theseparties may approve of participation in the bourgeoisParliament and the other reject it, this difference of opinion is now so immaterial that it would be mostreasonable not to split on account of it.   but even the existence of two such parties .at the sametime would be a great step forward in comparisonwith the present situation; it would most certainly be a bridge leading to complete unity and the speedyvictory of Communism,&quot;The fact that Lenin1s letter is dated &quot;The Kremlin,Moscow, August 30, 1919&quot; shows the difficulty ofcommunication between the Bolsheviks and their supporters in other countries; both letters have apparently beenreproduced via the revolutionary &quot;Folkets DagbladPolitiken&quot; Stockholm, the editor of which i3 FrederikStrom, Bolshevik representative in Sweden.THE/
m  &apos; 9 &quot;mm(PHIS HOUSING question on January 17th a conference of delegatesrepresenting some 80,000 Monmouthshire workers andco-operators was held at Newport.   In the course of themeeting it was stated that South Y/ales needed 55,000new houses, hut no constructive plans were made.The Birmingham Housing Committee hope to complete1,000 houses by July; the &quot;Birmingham Ma^l&quot; gave adecided fillip to* the scheme by erecting six houses infifty days at Kingfs Norton, in order to demonstrate thepossibilities of rapid house building by privateenterprise.In Manchester an ambitious programme has beenadopted by a &quot;Building Guild Committee&quot;, whioh has madea definite offer to the local authorities to erect 2,000workmen1s houses by direct&apos;labour.   The local branch ofthe Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society was originallyresponsible for the scheme, Which has not &quot;been definitelyaccepted.   Similar schemes are being forwarded in Rotherhamand Wrexham,PROFITEERINGOn January 19th Mr, Hodges delivered a speech atWakefield in which he made serious accusations againstthe woollen magnates and the Government whioh are bestgiven in his own words:&quot;Only to-day I have heard the first rumblingof a movement which- will 30on find expression inour political life,   I have heard woollen spinners,directors of important woollen concerns, aisousainga proposition to-day in my hearing - fortunately myfaoe is not so well known - and I heard themcongratulate themselves upon the fact that they were a great woollen federation in whioh there was plenty of money, even to oppose the Government if theGovernment should publish those reports in referenceto the 3,000 per cent increase In profits.These/
&quot;These people proposed to at once take legal proceedings to obtain an injunction against theBoard of Trade to prevent the British publicknowing the real facts; and they congratulated them-selves that in their strong federation there is plenty of money to enable them to carry out such a proposal,and money talks,&quot;Even tho Labour members who threaten to publish the reports on their own initiative will find an injunction against them doing so,&quot;NATIONALIZATION OP THE MIKESThere is little fresh matter in connection with theuampaign for nationalization, which is being vigorouslyconducted all over the country.Wot for the first time, Mr, Smillie iras expressed hisfears that Indian coal might be used /to obstruot Britishminers1 demands.   Addressing a large meeting at Dundee onJanuary 20th he said that during the past few months, assoon as there was likelihood that the miners might becomeuneasy, enquiries had been made as to the extent to v&amp;iichIndian coal might be exported to the ports we supplied withcoal from here, and might perhaps be brought into thiscountry to take the place of British coal.   He was all for organising the Indian mine workers up to the condition ofthe British mine workers, and would be prepared to urge thatit was the duty of the Miners1 Federation of Great britain to send organisers to India to organise Indian labour,FEELING AMONGST US-SERVICE MSN   - &apos;Further light is thrown on the proposed International .Congress of Ex-Service Men by an interview with Mr. JohnBeckett, Chairman of the national Union of Ex-Service Men,in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; of 16th January,    A passage from a,letter sent by the Republican Association of Ex-Soldiers in france runs as follows:We/
9 9 16 L1&quot;Wo wish to organise a great InternationalCongress in Switzerland of ex-soldiers of allthe belligerent countries.   It will be an imposingprotest of all the heroes&apos; -&apos;of all the victims of the war - against Jingoism, against NationalHatred, against War.   It will be a repudiation ofthe &quot;glory&quot; of War, a condemnation of militarism,and a clear affirmation - formulated for the first time since wars bogan by the actual oombatants -that they have&quot;no quarrel with One another; butthat they have, on the contrary, the same interestsin the same fight against the same masters,&quot;The Congress further proposes &quot;to take steps inall countries, at the time when the soldiers4 prestige for*glory1 is at its height, to teach the children to despisewar and armies.&quot;The General Conference of the National Union of Ex-Servioe Men has been postponed until the 28th-29th February.Ex-Colour Sergeant Major C.E, Leatherland, Chairman of theCentral Branch, who has been nominated for the office ofGeneral President of the Union, told my correspondentrecently that the Union was determined to obtain itsdemands by fair means or foul, and added, &quot;We are going tothe Government with a whip in our hands.&quot;The Labour Party is working energetically to capture the votes of ex-Sorvice men and has allotted twenty seatsfor contest by the National Union of Sx-Service Men.   Theleaders of the National Union declare that it is useless to expect justice from their Government if unaided by theLabour Party.3x-Lieutenant Nicholson, to whom I referred in my lastreport   in connection with the &quot;Red Army&quot;, is dangerouslyactive.   It is reported that in Reading, where he has been only a few months resident, he has collected some 300-400ox-Service men to whom he consistently preaches revolution.He is probably boasting when he says that he has a battalion of men ready to join the Red Army in&apos;London and Reading,that/
that their arras will he obtained after the manner ofSinn Feiners and that he has in his possession plans to throw barricades across roads and railways.Another correspondent reports that sweepstake tickefor the Lincoln Handicap are bein^ sold to raise money ftho Red Army; the man who sold him the tickets producedNicholson^ card and said that he was &quot;pulling the striRs-Service men are awaiting with keen interest theresult of the deputation to the Prime Minister. Varioujthreats of demonstrations have been made, in the event the deputations not being received. A Woolwich officialhas stated that the members of twenty London branches of-the National Federation of Discharged and DemobilisedSailors and Soldiers have received instructions to holdthemselves in readiness for 24 hours notice of the demonstration.NATIONAL COK^KSNCE OF FORKING CLASS ASSOCIATIONSAt this conference, which was held under the auspiof Raskin College on January 17th, Mr. Brownlie, Chaiof the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, read a paper Ion &quot;The Workers1 Interest in Output&quot;.   This was issued!to delegates in the agenda and has been disoussed in 1Press.   The main point of interest is that his contentthat the workers must increase production has arousedless opposition than was the ca.se with his letter ofAugust 25th, 1919, to the Trade Union Congress.THE SHOP STSVfARDS MOVEMENTAt the recent conference, mentioned in the lastreport, the following National Council was ejected:
(&apos;/.&apos; H hA, MaoManuB, Central London Council, President.George Boot, Ci*ayford, Secretary,J.T. Murphy, Sheffield Workers1 Committee,Kiytst.

The first named,who was appointed organiser at  5 per week when released from prison, drew his full salary for two weeks only.MNIYBRSABY Off THE DEATH Off &amp;IRL LIEECTBCHT MD ROSA LGXBMBI3RGOn January 16th London&apos;extremists met, to the numberof some 250, to coiaaemorate the death of their Gorman&quot;Comrades&quot;.   The speakers were Mrs. Walker and MissPankhur3t, Workers1 Socialist federation; W, Ifrde, DritishSocialist Party, and Eden and Cedar Paul, who eulogisedthe &quot;martyrs&quot; and compared conditions obtaining to-day in britain and Germany.   There was some talk of perpetuatingtheir memory and tactics by demonstrations in trafalgar square.Articles on the two Germans have had prominentplaces in the current issues.of extremist papers.PHILIPS . PRICE MD CHARLES TKEVELY.AKPhilips  Price sent from Berlin on December Slstto the workers of Gloucester an apologia which disoloseahis mentality and emphasises the deterrent value of theDefence/
Defence of the Realm Aot.   He writes:&quot;On the day you and the rest of British Labour,either by your votes at the ballot box or by any otheimeans drive out the Churchill-Lloyd George-Hortholiffeloligarchy, which has usurped power at Whitehall in yoilname, in that day will it be possible for me to returnto &quot;England under a guarantee of my personal safety. !As you know, the Defence of the Realm Act still existJin England.   Cjuite a number of its articles have neveJbeen ropoaled, and under their operation- a man canbe arrested and held in custody without trial, or if tried can be brought before a drumhead court martiJfor speaking and writing things which are unpleasant jto the Churchill-Lloyd George-Northcliffe iron heel. IHow, until the Act, which is nothing else but the     jinstrument of the V&amp;iite Terror in ;Sngland4 is repealed!all its provisions, I believe I can be of more use tojyou outside England.   Therefore my advice to you is, jget Dora repealed and Churchill hoofed out.   In the  jmeantime I can asTWS&apos; you that I am not wasting my tilI believe I can do more good in informing Labour in IEngland about the Labour and Socialist movements on t!continent than in returning to England,   For theproblem, as I conceive it, of the immediate future is!to establish a sound, efficient&apos;Labour International,!freed   from all Social Patriots, pseudo-socialists ailweak-kneed compromisers.   In doing my little bit to I&apos;   help in forming thii, I believe I am serving yourinterests.&quot;Let me,however, say that when I do return to your midst; it will not be as 1 Squire Price ofTibberton1, nor as &amp; director of Price, Walker andCo., but as your fellow worker in the cause of LabotH&quot;The properties left to me &apos;are so hedged about [by laws and .customs that I am forced to become a p&amp;rlof the exploitation machine.   As you will readily seflit is-impossible to change this one instance without!altering; the whole system.   The trustees of theTibberton estate are bound by the law to run the     jproperties on the old lines ...... &quot;No reforms from Habove, but.action from below, can alone make the worjj.of Gloucester docks and factories and the agriciiltur!c      labourers of the Cotswold and Tewkesbury vale free men and worthy heirs to the inheritance of British ILabour, I&quot;I wish it therefore to be publicly known that II am no longer responsible for the management of the!Tibberton estate, nor have I any voioe in the affair!of Price, Walker and Co,   Those revenues which under!the capitalist system come to me automatically I ini!to use and am using for the purpose of helping in Inter-gfoundation of a strong independent Labour Press in ;England.   This is the best instrument I can oonoeiva!for helping. British Labour in its struggle,   Meanwhi! ;as I earn my own &quot;living as a press correspondent inl European capital, my thoughts are always with theworkers of the British Labour movement, and-not leem .with you in Gloucester.   I watch with indescribable!fjoy the victorious march of the Labour party at thel;;,:munioij*
mmunicipal elections, the ever-growing power of thegreat trade unions,&apos;the magnificent fellowship ofthe Triple Alliance, and I see in all these signsthe Mene-Tekel handwriting on the wall, the down-fall of the Northcliffe-Churchill oligarchy.   Iwatch the same signs in Germany, 11&apos;rance, Italy anlPoland, and send&quot;messages of comfort to ourRussian comrades, those war-tried veterans of theproletarian revolution, that they may know that&apos;the workers of the West are coming to their aid.&quot;Price1s love of a   whole skin is matched by thatof his coxisin, Charles Trevelyan, who wrote to Berlinon January 15 th:&quot;I want to come out to see somethins ofGermany as soon as it Is suitable to come.   Ishould have decided to come at once but for t henews of disturbances in Berlin and the railwaytrouble.   I don&apos;t want to come over and be unableto move,   Nor do I come for the purpose of beingmowed down by NoskeTs maxim guns&quot;as soon as Iarrive.   But if you can advise that I should probably reach Berlin in the next three weeks and.  should not find much more than a normal state of- civil war. I of course will gladly take the riskof any average amount of discomfort.   Will youtherefore wire or: receipt of this your view,without indicating in the wire that.the questionis of a visit by me.   The word TsoonT would conveythat you thought I might come at once.   rMonthrwould suggest that it would be really advantageous to delay that length of time.   I may&quot;say it wouldsuit my plans better to come at once, if conditionspermitted of it.&quot;LIEUTENANT comaftder kctorter.

THE BAICUNIN PRESS AGENCYAnarchists and pro-Bolsheviks in this country, asabroad, have hitherto been antagonistic; efforts are,hov/ever, nov; being made to fuse the two movements;ireland there has beon no fresh development in the generalsituation during the past week, but the wave of lawlessnegains in intensity and the murder of the Deputy assistant commissioner Redmond on Wednesday night is the high wateimark of Sinn Fein in its campaign of murder.   About thesame number of Sinn Fein outrages took place as wereperpetrated last week but the police report an increase o60 indictable offences.   How far these offences can be directly attributed to Sinn Foin.it is difficult to say, ialthough the Irish papers are greatly exaggerating thesituation, crime has, undoubtedly, also increased in Englduring the last few months.The Royal Irish Constabulary report that several atton police barracks were in contemplation in County Clarewere stopped by the intervention of the Roman Catholic clThe Motor Permit agitation still continues, being toalive for Sinn Fein interests.   No attacks upon cars in dublin are reported but several cars have been upset or damaged in the country.Reports chow that a good deal of apprehension existsas to the next move on the part of the Government.   the extremists on the Sinn Fein Executive fully expect drastiiaction and are reported to be plotting retaliatory measitfas a reply.   One report states that arrangements have beeimade /
d 4mado to seize electric power stations and gas works anato out main lines of communication by telegraph and telephone in the event of.concentrated action by theIri3h Government.   The extremists are of opinion that this can be easily done through employees in such places withSinn Fein sympathies.The final results of the Irish municipal electionare not yet completed, but it is reported that if SinnFein get a large majority they may refuse- to pay compensation for Sinn Fein outrages.Ihi

3 f;l   lAPPENDIX   IIORGANISATION Of LOYAL CITIZENS- IK ,WINNIPEG DURING__THE STRIKE IN 1919,__________On May 17th, 1919, the General Sympathetic Strikebroke out under the subterfuge of &quot;Collective Bargaining&quot;,ultimately involving, beside Municipal affairs, theProvincial Government by calling out the Telephone Operatorsand the Dominion Government by disrupting the Post Officeand Mail Service.It has been disclosed that this strike was not an industrial dispute but really an attempt to overthrowconstitutional government and to replace it by a form of soviet Government planned and fashioned by the industrial workers.of the World.   The strike petered out in about six weeks and became a failure owing to the public-spiritedaction of the citizens in quickly getting together and baok-ing the authorities.   This action is best illustrated by theattached chart, which gives the organisation of the CitizensCommittee of 1,000 and the various activities of theDepartments.It is interesting to note that almost the entireVolunteer Special Police Force was composed of returnedofficers and men of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, ar&amp;that a great mny of the 30,000 workers on strike werealiens.   There were about 37,000 registered alien enemiesin the Winnipeg district.   The Volunteers supplied by theCitizens1 Committee of One Thousand to carry out any workdid not take over and. administer, but in every case wentitin and. assisted only.   The duties of Department 400 (public safety) were to patrol all streets, fire alarm boxes andhydrants.   To guard private and. public properties and assist/
assist the authorities in maintaining law and order,   Theobject of this Department was to mould public opinion andcorrect wild rumours, etc., with the result that there wasa material reduction in the number of false alarm,  callsfrom signal boxes, a general feeling of safety and secirritestablished, especially amongst the women, and a fullerresponsibility of citizenship awakened.
