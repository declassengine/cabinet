This Document is the Property ofHis cfntannr: Majesty^ Government.)From Viceroy, 11th January 1920.(Received 12th, 1.0.30 a.m.)No. 0.   Foreign Secret.   Afghanistan.   We read position as follows:Firstly. It is possible that Afghan Government now genuinely suspect our intentions and mistrust our motives, and believe that we are inspired in our. dealingwith them by imperialistic and expansionist policy, and so threaten their integrity and independence. Amir is surrounded by secret enemies, who seek his destructionthrough embroilments with us, and by flatterers who exaggerate his power, and liehas also listened for some months to unoontradicted arguments and misrepresentationsof Bravin, and of emissaries from our own frontier tribes. Simultaneously all touchwith us has been lost, except through infrequent letters and through not veryintelligent Afghan Envoys. Until this atmosphere of probably genuine suspicion isdispelled, no policy, concession or threat can win more than temporary success, and fresh dangers will arise whenever Afghans think themselves strong enough to attackus in conjunction with frontier tribes, or bluff us into additional concessions. only hope of dispelling this atmosphere seems to us to lie in frank personal discussion withreal directors of Afghan policy Amir and Mahmud Tarzi who are to ns at presentquite unknown and incalculable factors. It is even not impossible that such discussionmight, without our having to employ either threats or offers of concessions, convince the Afghan Government of disadvantages and clangers of drifting away from us and towards the Bolsheviks, and such discussion seems hi any case essential preliminary to any definition of our future mutual relations. &apos; Let ns get over stage of recriminations,and before we set out to negotiate.Secondly. If we are ultimately to negotiate on basis of appeals to Afghan fears,cupidity or ambition, we ought obviously to try to do so at period of oar greateststrength so far as possible, whereas time from now until about next October willprobably he period of our greatest weakness, both internally and externally, and during this period we would wish to bring about detente without committing our-selves to final negotiations.Thirdly.-It would be a great advantage to discover, before any pretence atnegotiations, real scope of Afghan aspirations, and to let them know in friendly waylimit up to which we can go to meet them, so that negotiations when they come maynot begin under shadow on both sides of unknown and impossible demands, largeportion of which may have to be jettisoned with consequent soreness.Fourthly. Preliminary explanatory discussion not specifically undertaken withfinal treaty as its immediate aim is likely to be much more frank, unconstrained andilluminating.    Participants are not bound to make concessions, concealments orreservations in order to come away with treaty of some sort in their hands, and failure to obtain treaty does not constitute diplomatic breakdown.We admit that there might be some danger of his temporarily misinterpretingour suggestion of conference as sign of weakness, but even if he did we hopefirmness and frankness in discussion would dispel this illusion, and we think it more likely that he would construe it as obvious diplomatic move. To hold outinducement to him to abandon Bolsheviks without first satisfying ourselves of hisbond fides would surely be. much more open departure from policy of treaty andmore likely to be ascribed to fear than offer of preliminary exploratory discussion which we have suggested, since former would be practically indistinguishablefrom policy of ignoring altogether Amir&apos;s breaches of stipulations and engagingforthwith in negotiations for definite treaty of friendship. As regards attitude tobe adopted in the event of the Amir declining the invitation, both on his own andon Mahmud Tarzi&apos;s account, this would depend upon the tenour of his reply. Ifit were blank refusal, or recriminatory, our obvious (? course) would be to persistin present policy of aloofness and watchfulness, and to hope for favourabledevelopments while preparing for trouble. If it contained some plausible attempt at denying or explaining away his failure to satisfy our test, there might then beopening for us to admit Afghan Mission for negotiations. In the last resort we might possibly suggest to you despatch of small British Mission to Kabul tocarry on explanatory discussion on lines above suggested. We do not wish to put this forward as definite suggestion at present, but we would remind you peculiarconditions always make it really difficult for either the Amir or his chief advisers to leavethe country, especially when their position is precarious, or to trust fully to delegates.In consequence it is, and has always been, inevitable that important negotiations
shall be conducted either by letter, which is unsatisfactory, or by discussion at Kabul, and despatch by us of missions to Kabul has not in the past been taken as confession of weakness.. Despatch of .l)ane&apos;s Mission was opposed to the refusal of Habibulla to meet Lord Curzqn in India, One advantage of . suchmission would possibly be that our representative might be on the spot tocontradict Bolshevik emissaries&apos; allegations; or to put the most favourable (corruptgroup) on Turkish peace terms. As regards inducements to be offered to the Amir inreturn for sincere friendship when negotiations take place, we should have&apos;preferred to defer consideration of these until our immediate policy is settled, but, in&apos;rep1y to your enquiry, we can now mention following possibilities: Payment of arrears of subsidy due to late Amir, including one crore of rupees finally promised; renewal of subsidy; rebate of Customs on re-exports to Afghanistan; re-establishment of AfghanAgencies in India in such places as Peshawar, Karachi, Bombay, under Consulardesignation, which Amir seems to desire (this would be subject to promise of reciprocity), with right to fly Afghan flag, for which his envoy has asked ; some formof -representation in St. James&apos;s, provided this did not clash with the present directdealings between the Viceroy and Amir ; better postal arrangements ; grant of title of &quot;His Majesty&quot; ; restoration of the privilege of importing arms, provided this doesnot infringe the Arms Convention; loan of officers and materials for improvingcommunications; irrigation; manufactories; and education. We think, afteratmosphere had been cleared by preliminary discussion, something might be done with (corrupt group) offer, although we&quot; doubt whether Amir could, in any ease, be induced at present to break openly with Bolsheviks from whom be is now to receiveterritorial concessions. These are always prized by an Asiatic ruler above all also,-and we cannot offer him the like. But if we can regain tolerable friendliness withAfghanistan, without insisting on absolute breach with Bolsheviks, this last is almostsure to follow in course of time. Meanwhile latest news from authentic source is thatAmir is serenely preparing to send a mission to Rawalpindi on 8th February, quiteignoring the possibility of our refusal to receive it, and is even considering nomination of B ravin as one of the Afghan delegates.   Necessity for decision is therefore urgent.
