General.Nil.Part II.-Departmental.Unemployment and the Out-of-Worh Donation.No very appreciable alteration in the unemployment position occurred during the-last quarter of 1919. Some little increase as regards men may be detected, but is not as yet very noticeable. The general position, if measured by the number of applicantsregistered at the Exchanges, stands for the moment at substantially the same level asin the middle of September. On the 19th September, immediately before the railway strike, the total number of workers of all categories on the live register slightly exceeded530,000, of whom a little over 407,000 were men and a little over 96,500 were women.(O 1951)  255  1/20  H &amp; sA
On the 19th December, the total on the live register was, in round j umbers, 541,000, ofwhom 473,000 were men and a little over 48,000 were women. This figure may be taken as giving, for the whole of the workers of the country, an approximate unemploymentrate of 3&quot;4 per cent., as measured by the Exchange Eegisters.From the beginning of September to the end of October there were indications of aslow rise in unemployment, the highest point reached being during the week ending the31st October, when the live register for the United Kingdom stood at nearly (500,700,.ofwhom 479,500 were men and a little over 89,000 women. The decline which, in spite ofthe increasing effects of the moulders&apos; strike, has taken place since that date cannot betaken in every case to imply reabsorption in industry. The cessation of out-of-workdonation for civilian workers on the 24th November was marked by an immediate declinein the numbers registered at the Employment Exchanges, and the decline has since con-tinued. The number of workers remaining on the live register on the 21st november was nearly 592,000. On the 28th November it had decreased to a little over 575,000, andthe decline in subsequent weeks reduced the total to 541,000 in the middle of December.The fall has been much more marked in the case of women and juvenile workers thanin that of men. The number of men registered on the 21st November was 490,251, andthis number had fallen by the 19th December to 473,000, a decline of roughly 4 per cent.In the case of women, the fall during the same period was from 73,925 to 48,126, a decreaseof over 35 per cent., and in the case of juveniles from, 27,763 to 19,881, a decrease of 28per cent. This difference is to some extent accounted for by the fact that women andjuveniles have been more represented than men in the uninsured trades and have not,therefore, the alternative of drawing unemployment insurance in place of out-of-workdonation. In fact, the increase in the number of unemployment insurance books lodgedsince the stoppage of donation, though considerable, has so far affected male workersonly. The total number for males has risen from roughly 67,900 during the week ending the 28th November to 87,301 on the 19th December, while the number lodged for femaleworkers fell during the same period from 34,790 to 30,369.Unemployment among ex-members of the Forces may still be tested by the statistics of out-of-work donation policies lodged ; for ex-Service men the out-of-work donation schemestill stands in its entirety. From a purely numerical standpoint, there is some slight in-crease of unemployment. The policies lodged at Employment Exchanges by men from theForces began to increase in number after the railway strike, and with some slight fiuctua-tion, this increase has since continued. The total stood on the 5th September at 324,800.On the 19th December it had risen to nearly 365,500. But demobilisation is still adding to the number of ex-Service men to be absorbed into industry, at a rate varying duringthe last few weeks between limits of 1,340 and 2,350. Allowing for this fact, the proportionof ex-Service men still without employment has if anything declined slightly. The numberof women from the Forces in receipt of out-of-work donation has, however, increased substantially since September, demobilisation having proceeded rapidly during thisperiod. The number of policies lodged on the 5th September was slightly under 2,000,but had risen by the 12th December to nearly 5,600. The reabsorption of these workershas not quite kept pace with their demobilisation, the proportion reabsorbed at the beginningof September being estimated at 77&apos;6 per cent., and the proportion on the 12th Decemberat 70*1 per cent.Slight modifications of the scheme for out-of-work donation made during the past week may add somewhat &quot;to the number of ex-Service men receiving donation. At thetime when out-of-work donation had ceased, a special extension of the scheme for ex-members of the Forces permitted the payment of donation at the rate of 20s. for men,and 15s. for eligible women, for a period of nine weeks up to the 31st March, 1920, in caseswhere policies under the normal scheme had been exhausted or had expired. Nearly24,000 ex-Service men have already qualified for this extension. Applicants had, underthe original terms, to show to the satisfaction of a Local Employment Committee that,except in cases of sickness, accident or disability, they had been employed in each of no less than 10 weeks since leaving the Forces or since the date of the armistice, whicheverwas the later date. These conditions have now been modified so as to permit the pay-ment of donation to an applicant who can satisfy the Local Employment Committee thatthe reason for bis non-fulfilment of this condition arose directly from service with theForces, that he had no control over these reasons, and that before he joined the Forceshe was normally in employment, a fact which 20 weeks&apos; employment during the 12 months before enlistment was considered sufficient to prove. This special nine weeks&apos; extensionof the out-of-work donation has also been granted as from the 1st January, ,1920, to merchant seamen, who thus become the only class of civilian workers entitled to out-of-work donation.
Part III. The Labour and Socialist Press.The Labour Movement.A number of articles appear in the papers reviewed this week which are recapitulations;of the events of 1919 or else forecasts of those of 1920.   The bulk of these articles are not sufficiently interesting to be worthy of review.   The &quot; British Citizen &quot; announces that-an attempt is to be made within the next few months to overthrow democratic governmentand to set up some form of &quot; Soviet &quot; rule, by means of a &quot; general strike,&quot; and anticipatesthat this strike will be accompanied by an upheaval in Ireland.  The Government issummoned to take action, and not only by making these &quot; facts &quot; public, but also by putting forward a bold industrial policy in. general and a coal policy in particular.   Theother papers, however, are remarkably free of any discussion of the coal mines nationalisa-tion problem and its allied issues.   The subject that arouses the most intense discussion is rather the more domestic matter of the future of the I.L.P.   The &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought &quot; discusses the memorandum on &quot; Socialism and Government &quot; prepared^ by this body for submission to the conference of the Second (Berne) International which was tohave taken place in February.   From the recent history of the Socialist movement in finland, Russia and- Germany it endeavours to refute the contentions of the I.L.P.   Itis maintained that the position, taken up in the memorandum towards &quot; direct action &quot;for political purposes is purely one of opportunism, which cannot be permanently tnain-tained.    The argument is put forward that any adherence to the political strike shouldlogically be followed by a declaration for the &quot; Revolution &quot; and for the &quot; dictatorship ofthe proletariat.&quot;  In conclusion, it is hinted that the executive of the I.L.P. is now outof touch with its branches and these branches are recommended to signify their disapprovalat the annual conference of the party, which will be held at Easter.   Similarly the incidents-connected with the abortive selection, of a Labour candidate for the Nelson and ColneDivision receive full notice in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot;   It is claimed that the situation inNelson is one of great seriousness for the Labour Party.   The question must be put to the test &quot;whether the political Labour movement is to continue to be dominated by readiness-tionary Trade Union officials.&quot;   Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot;  promises a fuller discussion, of the matter at some future date, but he describes the claim of the UnitedTextile Factory Workers&apos; Association as being that &quot; certain seats are to be pocketboroughs belonging to certain interests.&quot;   In the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; a review of the Parlia-mentary session is made the occasion of criticism of the Parliamentary Labour Party, asat present constituted, for its lack of men &quot; of real debating ability,&quot; and the poor attend-ance achieved by its members.   It is asserted that Mr. Adamson has not the capacity to lead a party, &quot;which is the official opposition and which is nearing power.&quot;  The &quot; British.Citizen &quot; praises the &quot; leaders of Labour on the industrial side &quot; at the expense of the&quot; political Labour leaders.&quot;  Apparently this paper does not count the N.D.P. as contain-ing any leaders of Labour, for it devotes a laudatory article to a discussion of the merits,of each of the members of this party.   In the &quot; Clarion &quot; Mr. A. M. Thompson gives a fullsummary of the ironmoulders&apos; dispute and suggests that the history of this strikeshows the need of a &quot; general staff&quot; for the Labour movement.   &quot; There are not morethan two or three unions united enough to carry a strike of their own industry to a success-ful issue.&quot;  It may be noted that &quot; Justice,&quot; in remarking upon the need of the Labour&apos;Party for funds, does not show any pleasure at the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; publicity campaign and fears that this campaign may result in a diversion of money from the party.   &quot; If the&apos; Daily Herald &apos; had a hundredfold the circulation it has, it would still be quite useless to turn out the Prime Minister.&quot;Second (Berne) International.Last week, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; deplored the decision of the so-called Acting Committee of this body to postpone the Geneva conference, and suggested,that some attempt should be made to bridge the gulf between the Second and Third Inter-nationals. His remarks are echoed this week by Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour-Leader,&quot; who announces that the German Independent Socialists have issued invitations.to the Left parties in the Berne International to meet, in order to attempt to unite with.; the Moscow International upon a constructive policy. Mr. J. T. Walton Newbold, in&quot;Forward,&quot; indulges in a rabid attack upon the Second International and outlines the considerable change in outlook that the English Labour movement must undergo before,it is fit to ally itself with the Moscow International.* Of. Eeport, 17th December, p. 492.
Ireland,The proposals outlined in the House of Commons on December 22nd, by the PrimeMinister with regard to the future government of Ireland, are dealt with by the &quot; BradfordPioneer &quot; in a leading article. The article is occupied mainly in establishing the right ofthe Irish people to self-determination and in developing the implications involved in this principle, but no attempt is made to meet the difficulty of Ulster. The &quot; Labour Pioneer &quot;insists that Ireland&apos;s only hope lies now in Labour. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and&quot; The Call,&quot; on the other hand, are somewhat doubtful as to the intentions of the Parlia-mentary Labour Party. Mr. F. Willis, in the latter paper, shows more hostility to them than he does to the Government. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; wholeheartedly praises thePrime Ministers solution of the Irish problem.Unemployment Insurance.In a somewhat confused article, the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; discusses the reversion,on the cessation of the civilian out-of-work donation, to Part II of the Insurance Act, 1911,and in particular the payments which may be made to trade unions under sec. 106 of thatAct. It doubts whether the repayment to trade unions of one-sixth of their expenditureon unemployment benefit is a sufficiently great attraction to compensate the trade unionsfor the additional administrative expenditure involved, but draws attention to the factthat applications may be made for modifications in the administrative details of thescheme. This paper has always been hostile to the Exchanges and takes this opportunityto insist that the trade unions provide ample machinery for the administration of unem-ployment insurance and that the Employment Exchanges are not really needed.Part IV.-General Topics.The General Situation.The outstanding feature of the Labour situation this week is the attitude of the railwaymen towards the Governments offer for the standardisation of wages and thecontrol of the industry. At the moment it is uncertain what decision will ultimately bereached by the special general meeting of the N.U.R., which is at present in session, and itwould be rash to predict. It may, however, be said that it seems unlikely that the railway-men will take immediate drastic steps. It is more probable that they will instruct theirnegotiating committee to endeavour to obtain certain amendments of the terms in specified-directions. One consideration which suggests that in the meantime at least further negotia-tion will be preferred to a strike is that a resolution passed at the meeting of the triple alliance on the 27th November, 1919, provides that in the event of a failure of any of thethree bodies to secure their demands, a full meeting of the three executives should be summoned to consider the matter. Now, both of the other two members of the Alliancehave in the meantime chosen negotiation rather than striking with a view to the attain-ment of the objects of their respective programmes. The miners will take no drasticsteps to secure the nationalisation of the mines unless their present campaign of propagandafails to convince the country, and in any case nothing will probably be done until the specialTrades Union Congress about the end of February. The Transport Workers&apos; Federationhave just referred their programme to a Court of Inquiry, and it must be some weeks untilits decision is known. In the circumstances it seems rather unlikely that the two bodies which are at present treading the peaceful paths of negotiation and propaganda would lendtheir support to the N.U.R. in an appeal to the harsh decision of industrial action. TheTransport Workers&apos; Federation especially have also probably other good reasons for notdesiring to be involved in a strike.Another feature of the situation is the growing tendency for the rank and file to decline to accept the recommendations of their leaders. In the case of the railwajTnen,the leaders&apos; recommendations in favour of acceptance of the terms were very strong;yet these have apparently carried comparatively little weight with the men. And thefigures of the ironmoulders&apos; ballot show that a large majority of the men refuse to accede to their leaders&apos;.appeal to return to work, although that appeal is hacked by the authorityof the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress.
5 ? IUnemployment.During the week from 12th to 19th December unemployment was still further accen-tuated through the continuance of the moulders&apos; strike. The numbers of ex-Service menand women on out-of-work donation increased by 9,045 while the numbers of civilians onunemployment insurance increased by 2,210, bringing the total numbers under these two categories at the latter date to 370,680 and 117,670 respectively.Unemployment among the uninsured members of. the working community cannot beas definitely ascertained, as there is not the same inclination to register at an employment exchange when the worker is not entitled to draw payment. During the week underreview the new registration fell by 8,802 while the numbers on the live register fell by 4,762.The total live register for men remains practically the same, though there is an increasein the insured industries, and a decrease in the uninsured of nearly 5,000 ; but there is anet fall of over 4,000 in the live register for women, almost entirely confined to the unin-sured industries. This fall on the live register in uninsured industries may be partiallydue to an increase of employment, but is also partially due to the tendency indicated above to discontinue using the Exchanges when the necessity to do so in order to draw benefithas ceased.The Railwaymen.The Governments offer for the standardisation of the wages of railwaymen and forthe provision of conciliation machinery for the settlement of future labour questions onthe railways was announced on the 4th January simultaneously by the Ministry of Trans-port &quot;-and the National Union of Railwaymen. This offer includes a classification of abnormal standard rates and permanent standard rates which have been determined asfollows : To the average pre-war weekly rate of pay to the men in a grade or group of gradesthe sum of 38s. is to be added. This combined sum will form the present abnormal standard rate, and it is to be subject to a sliding scale whereby there is to be a reduction or increaseof Is. per week for every fall or rise of a full 5 points in the cost of living as shown by theMinistry of Labour&apos;s figures. No reduction of this abnormal standard rate can take placeuntil after September 30th, 1920. The permanent standard rates for the various gradesare contained in offers dated November 5th and involve in general an increase of 100 percent, on the average pre-war rates of the respective grades. The rates for any grade will. not fall below these permanent standards, however much the cost of living may comedown. The conciliation machinery which will be set up was explained in this Report forthe 10th. December, p. 472.In various centres this offer has been considered by the railwaymen, and hostile reso-resolutions have been passed by a large number of branches.The number of resolutions in favour of acceptance of the terms was very few. three main reasons seem to be responsible for the opposition to the terms. Most of the branchestake their stand on the original demand that the principle applied to drivers and firemenin the separate settlement for the locomotive staff shall be extended to other grades.That is to say, the basis of the new standard wage shall be the highest rate and not theaverage rate of any grade. In other words, they demand &quot;standardisation upwards&quot;instead of&quot; average standardisation.&quot; Further complaints are made that the permanentstandard rates are insufficient and that the sliding scale for the adjustment of wages inaccordance with the cost of living is objectionable. Mr. J. H. Thomas, in announcing these terms at Birmingham on the 4th inst., described the settlement as honourable and advised the railwaymen to accept. Mr. Bromley, addressing a meeting at Newport at the sametime, declared that since the locomotive men had had their increase the cost of living had increased by 17 points and Ms union therefore felt entitled to a further increase. Heintimated that after the settlement with the N.TJ.R. they would make farther claims. Onthe 7th January a special general meeting of the N.U.R., summoned to consider the Govern-departments offer, began at Unity House. The delegates considered the proposals, and receiveddetailed explanations from the members of the negotiating committee. No decision was arrived at and the conference continues.The Nationalisation of the Mines.The campaign in favour of the nationalisation of the mines continues.  Mr. Brace hasaddressed a number of meetings in South Wales, and Mr. Frank Hodges and Mr. James .Winstone and others have also delivered addresses in various parts of the country. ^ Itwould appear, however, that some of the more advanced miners fear that the nationalisa-tion campaign will be killed by &quot; tactics,&quot; and it is already apparent that the enthusiasm
which was behind the nationalisation crusade a few months ago is waning. In SouthWales it is reported that the campaign has been on the whole a dull and listless affair, andthe rank and file have been apathetic. All this suggests that a tendency may manifestitself towards industrial rather than political action, and a demand for a return to the direct action policy may be made. The whole situation will be discussed this week by a special meeting of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.It is reported that the Coal Association is preparing for an extensive propagandisteffort in order that the case against nationalisation may be fully set forth. This campaignwill extend over the whole country, and will consist both of the holding of meetings andthe distribution of literature.Building Trades.Unrest in the building trades with regard to wages is growing more marked. In theSouth-Western area a good deal of trouble has arisen. Both the employers and the tradeunions who are parties to a recent agreement are endeavouring to bring all building tradeemployers in the area, whether they were parties to the agreement or not, into line withthe wages grading of the area scheme. It is stated by the South-Western Building TradesEmployers&apos; Federation and the National Federation, of Building Trades Operatives thatat the time the area scheme agreement was submitted to the Ministry of Labour theyunderstood that it would be extended generally under the Wages (Temporary Regulation)Act. As that was not done they are now evidently campaigning with a view to extending,it generally themselves. Some local disputes in this area arising from this cause have beenreported. A dispute with regard to wages has also arisen in Worcester. Under theMidland Area scheme the men succeeded in being raised from Grade C to Grade B, but theemployers have refused to pay the rates of this grade. It is also reported that the building,operatives of Kidderminster threaten to migrate to adjoining districts unless they are paidhigher wages than the)&apos; are entitled to under the Midland area scheme. There appears to-be every likelihood that wages rates in the building trades generally will go higher. Inaccordance with the provisions of the South-Western area scheme agreement an applica-tion has been received by the employers&apos; federation from the operatives that, as from the1st May, 1920, Cfrade A towns shall pay 2s. per hour, and whilst it is possible that thedemand for building may induce employers to grant such a rate, there is no doubt that, in.some of the smaller districts, any further increase would lead employers to look askanceat the whole principle of the &quot;area &quot; agreements.Welsh Iron and Steel Trade.In view of the fact that the sliding scale agreement in the South Wales and Mon-mouthshire iron and steel trade comes to an end on the 31st December, improved machineryfor the settlement of disputes and the calculation of wages has been agreed upon by theSouth Wales and Monmouthshire Iron and Steel Makers&apos; Association and the Iron andSteel Trades Confederation and other Trade Unions. The new agreement provides forthe direct representation of the Trade Unions in arbitration proceedings, and for the suspension of strike action during the period of the negotiations. Machinery has also beenprovided for the purpose of dealing with local matters by the appointment of a committeerepresentative of employers and men, charged with full powers to bring about a settlement.In case of disagreement this Committee will decide what form the arbitration proceedingsshall take. The principal interest of this agreement lies in the recognition of the rightof Trade Unions to act on behalf of the men whereas hitherto the men were represented indisputes only by individuals from the firms concerned and not by the union.Shop Assistants.The important award of the Industrial Court with reference to the pay of shop assistants and others employed by the Army and Navy Co-operative Society, Ltd., seems likely to set a standard to which other large department stores will conform. Storeswhich have already agreed to accept the award or have intimated their intention of paying the scale it sets up are the Civil Service Supply Association, the Haymarket Stores, the junior Army and Navy Stores, and John Lewis, Ltd. The National Amalgamated Unionof Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, to which most of these shop assistants belong,held a large meeting at the Albert Hall on the 3rd inst. and reported large accessions ofmembers.  Mr. John Turner, general secretary of the Union, stated that nearly  3,000,000
was secured by increases of wages to the members last year. It was mentioned some weeks ago in this Report that there was great unrest in the distributing trades generally, and indepartment stores particularly, and it is clear that if this unrest had not culminated in the48-hour strike at the Army and Navy Stores, it might have found expression in a similarway in any of a dozen large establishments in the West End. As it is, the reforms desired by the shop assistants are being obtained largely automatically in accordance with theaward of the Industrial Court.&apos; Courts of Inquiry.In response to the request of a deputation from the National Council of Port LabourEmployers and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, for the appointment of aCourt of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act into an application by the workmenfor a standard minimum wage and improved conditions of dock employment, the minister has decided to appoint a Court of Inquiry to consist of four employers&apos; representatives and four Labour representatives, with an independent chairman. The two parties suggestedthat the Court should consist of three representatives from each side with an independent chairman, but the scheme finally agreed upon provides that, in addition to the membersnominated by each party, the Court shall include one representative employer and one representative Labour man, neither of whom will be connected with the dispute. Theterms of reference which have been drawn up instruct the Court to consider the question- of a standard minimum wage for dock and waterside workers, the problem of overtime andthe Conditions of employment at the docks.The Court of Inquiry appointed by the Minister to inquire into the question of thehours of labour of men employed in connection with the tipping and trimming of coalmet on the 1st inst. at Montagu House, under the chairmanship of Mr. Rigby Swift, K.C.A preliminary statement of the case of the men was made by Mr. Robert Williams.Mr. J. T. Clatworthy has taken, the place of Mr. J. Wignall, M.P., as a member of the Court.The next meeting of the Court will be held at Cardiff and has been provisionally fixed forthe 2nd February.Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act.Two cases under the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act have recently been heard by Munitions Tribunals. The Leeds Munition Tribunal heard a complaint that Messrs.R. W. Crabtree &amp; Sons, Leeds, had failed to restore the trade practice of a workman enter-ing his total daily time in a time-book irrespective of the actual amount of work done insuch time. The firm has retained a method introduced during the war Avhereby workmenshould &quot; clock &quot; the time of starting and finishing a job. The Court dismissed thesummons. The Glasgow Munitions Tribunal recently sustained a complaint by the: Scottish Brass Moulders&apos; Union that Messrs. William McPhail &amp; Sons, Glasgow, had failedto restore the pre-war practice of their establishment whereby light core work was doneby apprentices, and that they still retained three of the women who, during the war, hadbeen employed on this work. It is interesting to note that the Glasgow interpretation ofthe Act is that the trade practice means the practice of a particular shop. This is directlycontrary to the Leeds decision which was that a trade practice must be a generally acceptedcustom in the whole of an industry.Non-Unionism.The members of the National &quot;Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union employed atMessrs. Lever Brothers have decided to suspend their recent resolution not to work with non-unionists after the 31st December.Trades Union Congress.With reference to the Special Congress which it is proposed to hold in February,&apos;Mr. J. Bromley has circularised the branches of the A.S.L.E. &amp; F. Secretaries of branchesare requested to get their members to decide by resolutions whether they are preparedbo strike with all other trade unionists in the country to enforce (1) mines nationalisation ;(2) the ending of war with Russia ; (3)&apos; the abolition of conscription. The&quot; secretaries of other unions also are, it is understood, taking steps to consult the rank and file of their members on these questions.
Independent Labour Party.The Annual Conference of the Scottish Independent Labour Party was held at Paisleyon the 3rd January ; 218 delegates were present, representing 110 branches. The affiliationof this body to the Labour Party was endorsed and, by a largo majority, it was recom-mended that the I.L.P. should sever its connection with, the Second (Berne) international and affiliate with the Third (Moscow) International. The latter decision will be discussed by the Easter Conference of the Party.Amalgamation.The tendency within the Trade Union movement towards amalgamation continuesto be marked. The Amalgamated Society of Steel and Iron Workers of Great Britainhave decided to join the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, and it is expected that theTin and Sheet Millmens&apos; Association in South Wales will also join the Confederation.The merging of these unions will result in complete industrial unity in the iron and steeltrades throughout the county, with the exception that the National Federation of Blast-furnacemen still remains outside the Confederation. The Amalgamated Association of iron and Steel Workers and Mechanics of South Wales and. Monmouthshire has ceased to exist as from 31st December, 1919, and its work has been taken over by the Iron and SteelTrades Confederation, the National Federation of Blastfurnacemen, and the Workers&apos;Union. The Executive of the Amalgamated Union of Engine and Cranemen, BoilerFiremen and Wire Rope Workers are taking a ballot of their members on the question ofamalgamating with the National Union of General Workers. It is announced that the liverpool and Birkenhead Ship and House Painters&apos; Benefit Association has amalgamatedwith the National Amalgamated Society of Operative House and Ship Painters andTrade Union Friction,The friction that had occurred between the National Association of Theatrical Em-ployees and the Electrical Trades Union with regard to demarcation has been removedas a result of a conference with the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress.The Electrical Trades Union had made attempts to enrol theatrical electricians and cinemaoperators, and this was resented by the ISIational Association of Theatrical Employees.The agreement that has been reached provides that the two unions recognise each other&apos;s membership card in the entertainment industry ; that each union, undertakes not to inducea member of the other union to leave one union for the other, and that with regard to members of either union, employed in the entertainment industry, joint action should betaken to promote a joint programme for all members of both unions in any area and that immediate steps should be taken to provide a joint programme for those employed inpicture theatres.Labour and Russia.In accordance with the decision of the recent special Trades Union Congress, theParliamentary Committee has been endeavouring to obtain passports for a delegation to-&apos;visit Soviet Russia. It is understood that a reply has been received that the BritishGovernment cannot grant passports for a country with which it has no diplomatic relations.It is stated in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; that the &quot; All Russian Council of Trade Unions &quot; haswelcomed the proposal of a British Trade Union Delegation, and has assured it in. advance that every facility for its inquiry will be granted to it. The National &quot; Hands Off Russia &quot;Committee, at a special meeting on the 3rd January, expressed its approval of the idea ofa special national campaign for immediate peace with Soviet Russia. It was decided totake steps to obtain an immediate meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the TradesUnion Congress, the Executive Committee of the Labour Party, and the executives of thelarge trade unions and of the socialist parties, with the object of starting such a campaign.Labour and Ireland.The Parliamentary Labour Party&apos;s deputation to Ireland will leave for Dublin on the19th inst. It will consist of Messrs. Henderson, Adamson, Clynes, T. Wilson, W. P. Smithand J. A. Parkinson, and its intention is to discuss Irish political matters with, repre-sentative men of all shades of political and public thought. The deputation will visitBelfast, and m&amp;y also go to Limerick and Cork.
Labour and Austria.Representatives of the joint committee of the Parliamentary Committee of the TradesUnion Congress and the Management Committee of the General Federation of TradeUnions met in London, on the 5th inst. under the presidency of Mr. J. H. Thomas, toconsider the attitude of Labour towards the famine in Austria. It was decided to ask theassistance of the Co-operative Movement and. to make arrangements for sending necessariesto Austria.International Labour Office.The next meeting of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office will takeplace in Paris on the 26th January. M. Albert Thomas will act as Provisional Director ofthe Labour Office until the Governing Body has been fully constituted.Trade Union Topics.Manchester Unity of Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society. A protest appears in the currentissue of the report of this society from the Altrincham Lodge against the scheme for train-ing partially disabled soldiers as bricklayers.Association of Shipbuilding and Engineering Draughtsmen.
