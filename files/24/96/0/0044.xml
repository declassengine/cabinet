o a. b i a aA *SIIQRTAG3 0-&apos;1 &amp;R30IIN2ii iii IJOY^L air F0RC3.?:1S:10PANDUM 3Y TH3- HIlIIo-USR OF LIUITIHONS.With reference to the memorandum (G.P.413)by Itr, Churchill dated tho 7th instant, regarding&quot;the shortage of personnel in tho&quot;Royal Air Force in relation to its&quot;present liabilities as re,cards&quot;disposal of surplus material&quot;,it is to be observed that proposals are already beforethe Cabinet regarding the provision of personnel forthe custody guard in,?, and handling of surplus stores in(a) theatres of war overseas(b) at home.As regards (a), the proposal before the Cabinetsuggests the formation of a Disposal Corps on a Militarybasis for France, Italy, etc.As regards (b), it is proposed in the,scheme now before the Cabinet, to utilise civilian personnel.The numbers required for tho Disposal Corpsoverseas have been very fully considered.-   The Ministryof Munitions are in a, position te proceed with the schemeif the Cabinet decide that such a Corps shall be formed.It may here be remarked that the total personnel whichthe.Ministry propose to provide for the jar Office&apos; andAir Force requirements overseas (tho Jar.&apos; Office material
be in?; at least ton times as .?rec.t as that of the Airtforcs) do not amount in all to 6,000 men.   The Ministryof Munitions have already had occasion to point out tothe War Office that tho Army numbers stated to be employedon disposals work were largely in excess of the.numbers required for, and actually employed on, that duty.Similarly this Ministry are unable to accent the numbersnentiohod in memorandum C.?. 413 as being necessary tocarry out Air tforce work in connection with the disposalof surplus stores.Already the Ministry of munitions have taken over four large Depots of surplus stores from the AirMinistry and have thus afforded considerable relief tothe lattor in tho matter of personnel.It also may be observed that the Ministryof Munitions have for some time past been negotiatingfor a block sale which includes the Aircraft, Sngines,etc, now reported surplus, and any future similarsurpluses.   This proposed sale has been before the AirMinistry since November last, but the formal concurrence(subject to certain conditions) of that Ministry wasonly given on the 8th instant.It should further be observed that a fvreatdeal of the material thrown up by tho Air- Ministry assurplus is more or less unsaleable on ordinary commer-cial lines, and it is quite impossible to expect theDisposal Hoard, or any other body, to sell such material, .except at grave loss to the publio immediately it isthrown up.
So far as the Ministry of Munitions are concernedthey would -welcome a; Cabinet decision that all;depots,whether &quot;-belonging to the ,ar Office or the -Air JPorce which contain only surplus -stores, should bo handed over tothis Ministry.   The Ministry.are prepared to undertake the work now. done in this matter oy the ^r-my and AirForce, and will, for this./purpose ask for the provisionof a personnel that will not ewceed a tenth of the personnel which the Army and the Air Ministry M:;vestated at various times are boin^&apos; employed by thorn onthat duty,  - -I.14,It 201
