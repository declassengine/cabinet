Thelooomotive men in large oitiesr suoh as Bristol, are speoiallypersistent.   As there is dissension in the Union itnelf aKailway,Strike is oonsidered unlikely.In Labour oiroles it is believed that the Moulders willnot give way even if they have to seek other employment.There are rumours that the miners are losing faith in astrike as a means of foroing nationalisation.   They are moreinclined to trust to the ballot box.   The signs are against theoomponent parts of the Triple Alliance working together, and though a strike of the Transport Workers appears to becontemplated, it is more than likely that better counsels willprevail when it is found that they cannot count upon a sympathetic strike on the part of the Miners and .*ailwaymen.The most serious factor of the moment is unemployment, whichis/
is driving many of the more moderately-ajjinded ex-Servioe meninto the revolutionary oamp.There is abundant evidenoe that the great mass of labourio drifting steadily to the Left.   One sign is the inoreasedmembership of the Independent labour Party whioh, in Sootlandis becoming more extreme in its programme.   a serious factoris the inolination of the lower middle class towards Labour,The most urgent need at the moment is a solution forunemployment and better housing conditions.A closer oo*-operation between British Labour and SinnFein seems probable, but the Irish leaders are so muohdivided that the oo-operation is unlikely to be translated into action.   It is thought that the Sinn Feiners in Englandmay have reoourse to outrage before long.The shortage of household ooal in Jtenoashire willoause very serious industrial trouble in the immediatefuture, and on a large scale, unless something is donequickly to remedy matters.
THE CHANCES OP A NATIONAL STxtfKflSome interesting conversations with Ijabour leadersbearing on the Triple Allianoe and the chances of a DookStrike have just been reoeived.k leader of the (lookers said:&quot;So far as help from the Triple Alliance isconcerned, it is dead, buried and done for, and the sooner we realise that we are the poor relations,only to be used when it serves the purposes of theother Unions, the better it will be for us.   TheGovernment transport scheme was tested during thei&amp;ilway Strike and since improved, and if anybodyhere wants to strike against those odds withoutsupport, then they had better take our job.   Whensail Hie turned down the transport men, he said,* Paddle your own oanoe.   We have bitten off alreadyas much as we can chow.   You can get no help from us at all1, and Thomas said muoh the same thing.&quot;The soheme of the Transport men at present is to force the Government to have a sort of Coal Commission,and they are working hard in getting up their case,believing that, with the usual laok of organisation, theemployers will be caught unready.Both Smillie and Hodges seem to be very muoh afraid of a big strike happening before the next General Election,for they fear that it might prejudice the ohanoes of a labour majority.   Thomas and Cramp seem to be of muoh thesame opinion, and their polioy will be &quot;Work to duleBook, but no stoppage&quot;.   The mutual jealousy between theleaders of the Triple Allianoe seems to be growing,-iobert Williams ts particularly inoensed with Thomas andSmillie, who, he complains, treat him like a ohild.
1*1 ni 6wnmmmgim Mlbb -mmon the.whole the attitude of the miners regardingnationalisation is lees bellioose.   there is dertainlyno indication that they would refuse to strike at the command of\-their leaders, but, on the other hand,there seems * to be a growing conviction that they will obtain nationalisation by peaoeful means.   ho doubtthis view is the result of the labour suooess atbye-elections and my liverpool correspondent sends someilluminating reports of the miners&apos; conversationamongst themselves.*at a reoent miners&apos;&apos; club meeting at wigan thesuccess of the labour candidates at the recentbye-jhlections was discussed and one miner said theresults showed that trie publio generally, although&apos; not.perhaps in favour cf nationalisation of the mines-,.were sick and tired of both the liberal party and the coalition government, and were only.&apos;. &quot;*   waiting an opportunity of pitting a labour; government in power. :. the labour party wore pledged, in favour,of nationalisation of the mines and it looked.as.if the vei-y people who were opposed to\ nationalisation would be instrumental in bringing&apos; &quot;it about by voting labour.   that&apos; would be a bettorway than striking.   he did not believe they wouldever get nationalisation by striking for it.    hatwould oause great suffering to the general public and to the workers in particular beoause there was already, a serious shortage of household ooal beingfelt all over, the oountry and it would put thepublio more against it than ever.   besides if astrike took plaoe, the government would fight themand beat them and then have a general eleotion andthey oould say good-bye to nationalisation.*inother miner said that the best oase fornationalisation was made by the government them-eelvee.   everything they controlled they bungled,not beoause they were incapable, but because they knew the miners, rtailwaymen and transport workers were going to demand the nationalisation of those services and they bungled in order to put the publioagainst state control and the publio, as always,. were taken in.   the miners&apos; campaign itself he didnot think would do a &apos; damned bit of good.1   asfar as the general public are oonoerned the experiment of state control of iteilways, of thecoal trade and the telephone service have not given them&quot;muoh to enthuse about and at any ratethey oonsider the nationalisation of any industryis a matter for the nation itself to decide and-not for any one section.*at. a private oonoert and party at athertonrecently a oollier, who appeared to be-particularlywell/
we*   Informed, said &quot;This oampaign business&apos; waala gr^at joke.   The object apparently was to try^;Land &apos;kidT the oountry that it was in its own   lf interest that the mines should beoome national ?!property.   All kinds of fairy tales were toldabout ooal being oheaper and more plentiful with!consequent reduotion of the prioes of various otlcommodities, but he did not think the public woil*bite.&apos;   Ho said whether the oountry appeared to Ibe in favour of nationalisation or not, when the jMiners&apos; Campaign was over, the Miners&apos; Exeoutivegwould say it was, and then the Government would mto bring in a Bill to dispossess the present ownland if they refused, a general strike of the MiniKailwaymen and Transport Workers would probably lioalled.   Personally he thought the Triple Allianciwould commit suioide on this question, beoause hJLdid not believe the publio generally wanted it ailthey would want it still less if they had been tog -the truth, whioh was that the Miners wanted the flownership and oontrol of the Mines for themselves!whioh was not nationalisation at all, but syndioal&quot;Another collier here interposed and said there was no doubt that the majority of the mine:were in favour of nationalisation beoause they thought it would be of benefit to them, although there were plenty of oolliers in Lancashire whothought they would be worse off with it than withiit. Men who thought like that argued that it woube more difficult to force their demands when the,was in power, if it found itself unable to grant&apos; the&apos;demands of the oolliers, it would be oompelledto use the whole resources of the State in resist!!them.   He did not think the general publio wantedit.&quot;The first speaker said he knew a lot ofoolliers were against it, but it was as well to remember that the discipline of the Trade union movement was as perfeot as the discipline of the 1.British Army.   That had been proved by theRailway strike, for instance.   He believed thatat a given word of oommand by the Miners&apos; Exeoutivthe majority of the oolliers would &quot;down pioks&quot; antthe rest would follow - they would have to.&quot;Sinoe the reduction of the prioe of household ooal Ithere seems to have been a general shortage.   In Lancashlthe position is acute and Blackburn ooal. dealers re dentilorganised a demonstration to show that they were not responsible for the shortage; between 50-60 ocallorries piled with empty saoks were driven round thetown.   It is alleged that the colliery owners aredeliberately ourtailing the supply of household ooalas their profitsvon industrial ooal are so much higher.State was master,, because evenTttANSPOBT/
A meeting of seventy delegates was held on December30th at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street.   Theobject of the meeting was io reoeive reports on thequestion of a minimum daily wage of l6s., and to deoidewhether there should be a general enquiry or a stoppage of work/lie Executive Committee recommended an enquiry.Mr, Bobert Williams stated that he had put the matter before the Triple Alliance and had had a oonferenoe withMr. Smillie.  Mr. Smillie was of opinion that it wasa very inopportune time to oall a strike and the minerswould not help as they were at present engaged in the fight &quot;of^ their lives.   Mr. Williams oonsiders that thepresent bongestion&apos;of traffio is due, not to Dock andWaterside labourers, but to the ineffeotiverailway system, and in view of the enormous profits of the shipowners it would be advantageous to have an enquiry when the figure oould be made known,.,, It is thought that the Coal Commission inquirywas so valuable as propaganda for the miners that asimilar public enquiry for the Transport Workers, withthe ^Daily Herald&quot; as publio chronicler, would be,,equally advantageous.   The president, the General..- Secretary, and Mr. Ben Tillet would aot as the TransportWorkers&apos;federation representatives, and Messrs. Sextonand Bevin would conduct the case before the Court ofEnquiry., -... ,,,, , :the hottsinq gpastionThe Annual Conferenoe of the Soottish LabourHousing Association, held on January 2nd, showed the increasing discontent on the:housing difficulties.Several speakers advocated Direct Aotion, especiallyduring a disoussion upon the acquisition of land.Aooording to a oiroular distributed during theproceedings/
9i- 4 *proceedings, the land was to be taken from the landjowners; the State would provide material and moneythe workers would provide the labour.In South Wales the ex-*3ervioe men are beomingrestive.   Although their wages are good, they areoompelled to live under conditions which they desoriias &quot;appalling,&quot; and even moderately-minded men aretalking of revolution as the solution.During a disoussion of the Birmingham City Counon the question of dilution of labour for the ereotiof houses, a strong opinion was expressed that theon factories and luxury buildings should oease untilthe shortage of dwelling houses was remedied.   TheLabour Councillors were against dilution.   One of threcommendations to the Ministry of Heoonstruotion wa(that the Government should veto any oonstruotlonalwork on luxury buildings.UNEMPLOYMENTViolent language was used at a small meeting heat Newcastle-on-Otyne on the 20th December, when Mr.Ben Spoor, M.P., accused the Government of negleoti.ilto produce necessaries in Government faotories.  Mr,ftobert WilliamB oompared the Soviet Government inHussia with that in England, and Mr, J.T. Grinton,Seoretary of the Discharged Soldiers, called theGovernment murderers,.and cited the case of a soldlel, who was alleged to have, committed suicide owing tostarvation.  He suggested that on Christmas Eve theunemployed should raid the bhops and take what they required, and he offered to lead them.   It issignifiornt that a local J.P.

Co-operative Wholesale Sooiety at Manchester, however,that Co-operative funds could not be used freely on,,the oooaeion of every industrial strike and that nomoney whatsoever would bo given from the Co-operative wholesale 3ooiety&apos;s Bank to Trade Unions, or * even to.distributive Co-operative Societies, without goodsecurity.The Leamington branch of the National union offiailwaymen have requested the Exeoutive Committee towithdraw all money invested in War Loan and put it into the Co-operative wholesale Sooiety.The comments of my Leeds correspondent on theSpen Valley Qye-Eleotion are an interesting reflex oflabour feeling in his district.   He writes:&quot;Twelve/
&quot;Twelve months ago Jdyers and his people we:so poorly organised and &apos;financed that they werethe point of not fighting, but the 8,000 votespolled surprised them as to the amount of unexpeisupport in the division,   Since then they have worked steadily but not in any great dimensionand the death of Sir Thos.

The greatest w--rk hasbeen done by Wallhead, $nowden and his wife,Maodonald f and local I ,L.P. people, Outhwaite,Trevelyan and Colonel Wedgwood.   Offioial labourleaders subh as Henderson and Walsh have done veilittle.   Myers of course has had a very hostilepress locally and his war attitude was made the- most of on polling day; the other candidates hadbetween them 200 motors, whilst idyers had 9.&quot;The 11,900 votes represented the bulk of tlmale workers of the division for Myers, the womenoountered the votes of their men folk.   The baitof a ride, in one of the sumptuous motors was a  Jgreat draw to the bulk of the politically ignoraiwomen electors. .&quot;Myers1 supporters and workers are espeoialoonoemed about the women.&quot;The Bromley Eye-Eleotion must be gratifying tothe Labour &quot;Ifr-rty; it shows the instability of the electoral mind, whioh still requires a lot of spadework in the way of propaganda if the middle olass isnot to be won oVer to Labour,   The ever-inoreasingcost of living probably accounts for the turnover of votes.FEELING AMONGST EX-SOLDIEtiSMy correspondent reports grave unrest amongstex-Service men in Wales, due principally to inadequatpensions and gratuities; many have had to seekadmission to the workhouses.   The coalfields&apos; extremishave not been.slow to exploit this disoontent and theresult has been, latterly, a steady growth in the membership of the National Union of Ex-Servioe Men,whioh has now 12 branches and about 5,000 members inthe area.   The organiser and secretary of the Newportbranch, Leonard G. Telling, is the leader of themovement.   The strongest branoh is at Treherbert,rihondda/

THE ASSOCIATED SOCIETY OF LOCOMOTIVE ENQINEMEN AND FI^MSNAooording to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;;of Deoember 31st,every branch of the Associated Sooiety of LooomotiveBnginemen and Firemen has received a letter from. Bromley, the general secretary, regarding theSpeoial Trades Union Congress which is to re-assemblein February.The oiroular points out that before this Congresswill come the question of the nationalisation of mines,the withdrawal of troops from Russia, and the abolitionof conscription; it recalls to the members the faotthat their own annual assembly has already passed aresolution framed in the strongest possible terms onthese three matters.The secretaries of the branches are requested tomake their January branch meeting a speoially summonedone, and they are asked to get their members to deoideby disoussion and resolutions whether they are preparedto strike with all other trade unionists in the country the Labour Exoh&amp;ngo I have notioed how energetloand persistent a oertain class of men are inadvocating doctrines whioh are closely allied toBolshevism.   These men have been more in evidenoesinoe the out of work donation oeased and in myopinion trouble will ensue unless steps are taken,to combat the influenoe they possess.&quot;In my mind is not the least doubt that duringthe ooming winter there will be praotioally anupheaval if not a revolution engineered by thesehotheads, and many otherwise harmless men may oedrawn into it by the speoious argument I have heard repeatedly used, &apos;We have got nothing atpresent, so we ooVt lose anything and we may getsome, any way they oanrt take anything from us.1This is dangerous doctrine but it appeals to menrespeotable and loyal to King and Country who areout of work and brooding over the sight ofwealthy people going shopping in their oars andthey see the big display in all the shop windows,olothing, food and toys they would love to purchase for their wives and ohildren but have not the means.&quot;No words oould adequately oonvey the seriousness of the situation to you.&quot;

Delegates of theIrish Labour party have formed a District Committee,under the supervision of William A.

EXTRACTS FROM RECENT VIOLENT SPEECHES

On January 4th J. Bromley at Newport stated that he believed wholeheartedly in direct action when necessary; industrial and political action must not be divided. Unless they had strength they would never get justice. They had received an increase in wages but they had to remember that whatever they, as ? received, the capitalists never lost, and so long as the system of capitalism remained they had to fight it. Evidence of capitalists&apos; methods was already forthcoming in their sphere. London Tube fares were to be advanced 50% and freight rates were to be raised Capitalist "blood money" had to be paid first. They would not lose one ? of profit, interest or dividend. Political action, backed by the requisit? industrial strength, was the only way to alter it.

"I am not one to preach a bloody revolution but only for one reason, because, unfortunately the people of this country are not ripe for ? the law into their own hands. It would mean ? rising of the people being quelled as in Ireland because they would not be united. I am for a revolution that will remove capitalism at all costs. I believe that there is going to be a chance for labour, politically. If ever we get power, politically, to begin to make a way the other people will show you whether they believe in direct action or not."

At the annual dinner of the Woolwich Arsenal Shop Stewards Committee, Tom Mann stated that his election to the secretaryship of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers meant that his members were in favour of nothing less than the complete abolition capitalism. "If there are any men in the A.S.E. who don&apos;t  
don&apos;t want that done, for God&apos;s and my sake throw moout...&quot;  They were not oonceined as to yjhether theindustry would pay oh capitalistic lines, and said&quot;Damn^the capitalistic) system; we are out for theco-operative one.&quot;Speaking at a &quot;Hands Off Ireland&quot; meeting atGlasgow, on January 4th, J. Kerr bald that he did notbelieve resolutions would do any good - too long theyhad believed in passing resolutions.   They must beprepared to support all revolutionary movements.   If. *u I in -.r;-! e;:- ul \ tfioll     :;&quot;    -v ;their oomrades in Ireland had to adopt guerillawarfare as tfcey are now doing it was beoause the BritishEmpire compelled them to do so,   He would like toknow when the British working men, were ooming out asBolsheviks.   They had.to follow,men like John McLean.He asked those who were not linked up with revolutionary.organisations to join at onoe.At the same meeting Sean,McLaughlin said:&quot;What we want to see is Ireland freed and-when it is freed we will attempt to free every other country.   We are well aware that Ireland--:,--.:-;OouId not maintain&apos;her&quot; freedom one hour while there is a capitalist nation in Europe.   We havemade up&apos;our minds &quot;that the time is oome when we must bring about a workers.&apos; .republio, not. only in Irolandy&apos;but:in Groat Britain ......Itis the duty cf every irisliaan to get into everyrevolutionary movement in &apos;Gr;3at Britain to bringabout the overthrow of the. capitalist system.:..-ThefBritish^vo^^rs&quot; iiuVtrwatce up to the fight .if they aro over to be, freehand it must be throughthe Irish people.&quot;1THE INDUSTRIAL woigcbss op THE wofflfp      . .,,On January 4th an Industrial Workers of the Worldmeeting was held in Trafalgar Square at whioh GeorgeHardy, Tanner and riamsay spoke.

Mr. Lansbury visited Manchester on Deoember 30th, as.. stated that the inoreasid circulation had had abenefioial effeot on the advertisement revenue and while he oould not guarantee interest for the first three or four years, he oould absolutely guaranteeinterest on the 5$ debenture stock.On Deoember 26th, the Executive of the Lanarksh!Miners agreed that they had no power to give monetary,  aid to the &quot;Daily Herald,&quot; although they stronglyrecommended that all members should purchase at least one oopy daily.The oertified daily sales of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;from Maroh 31st to September 27th were 208,879 and.  between September 29th and November 1st 290,595.   Thirate for advertisements is being increased on february:1st by 5s,, making it J0&amp;. foT Bingle column inoh.-There was no apparent change in the oondition 0affairs in the Provinces during the past week.   Thegreater part of the oountry remains fairly quiet,though, with the exception of some of the.Ulsteroounti*
counties, disloyalty and unrest exist beneath thesurfaoe.the state of cork,&apos;clare and in a lesser degreo theother munater counties and pajway remains most unsatisfactory and amongBt property owners and quiet lawabiding people a feeling of great inseourity prevails.During the week about 90 offences of an indictablenature were reported, Of whioh tho polloe offioersconcerned consider that some 30 are direotly attributable to Sinn Fein, but when the faot that in six of the nineUlster Counties no lndiotable offence of any kind was reported is taken into consideration, it is apparent that Sinn Fein is responsible for a state of lawlessnessthat oohduoes to orime of whioh it may not itself be thedireot inoentive.Nothing has reoently occurred to indicate any fresh development in the Sinn Fein position.   Bxoept forattacks on police barracks and other offences traoeableto the Volunteers and a certain amount of organisingwork in connection with elections none of the suppressedsocieties are openly active,Attention is mainly direoted at present to themunioipal and urban Counoil elections for whioh pollingwill take plaoe on 15th instant.   In some plaoes the sinn Fein candidates have issued eleotion addressesand in Cork Sinn Fein and Labour have issued a jointaddress, but in smaller plaoes it is believed thatthe elections will lead to friction between these two parties.No Sinn Fein meetings took plaoe during the week,and no speeohes were delivered.The tone of the &quot;Watohword of Labour&quot;&apos;, the officialorgan of the Irish Transport and General Workers&apos; Union,in its issue of 27th instant was so outrageously badthat/
that orders were given,, to seize the copies of this number and its producers could scarcely have expectedanything else,   The paper is printed now in Salford,The issue of the &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; dated 3rd insis again most objectionable in tone and the police inthe Provinces ars seizing any copies exposed for sale,The current issue of &quot;Old Ireland&quot; contains whatpurports to be the Sinn Pein resumS of the presentsituation.   It refers, to-the,. Lord Lieutenant and thegovernment of the oountry in abusive terms.   The who]tone of the article is decidedly objectionable and -&amp;paper unquestionably doos harm.   The paper renews itsappeal to its readers to &quot;kick moderate English Lacoand remarks &quot;the.: e is a section of Labour in Englandwhioh deserves our respect and-whioh means what itsays, but it is not the kind,of Labour led by  tendersand Company.&quot;   Sinn Fein is no doubt anxious to allyitself with th$ extrrae elmexit- in English Labouroiroles and in some places the polios consider thatthe movement is inclined to become Bolshevist in towThs agit-afcion against the motor permitsrestrictions still continues :on. e small scale.   Thintapparently, tbat, the strike cannot be maintained asfunds are running low and some drivers       inclinegivo in, recourse -has been had to violence andintimidation: in seme plaoes,.   The ocouports in thr$motor oars were, fired on near Mullingar on 1st inctlbut no one was injured.   A threatening circular hesbeen issued,and some-picketing and assaults have teWplaoe in Quean&apos; s&apos; County.   In County Dublin a driverwas severely beaten and hib oar overturned.
