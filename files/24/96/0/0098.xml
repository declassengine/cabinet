PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM: From the Secretary of State for theColonies to tho Joveinors-Seaeral of Canada, theCommonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union ofSouth Africa,&apos;(Sent 6.5 p.m.   22nd January 1920)^^^^iji?^       Now that the League of Nations has been formally constituted a qu&amp;stion of great importancearises, viz:-   how correspondence between various british members of the League and the Secretariat General on matters connected with business of League should be conducted.     It seems to us essential that without delayarrangements should be devised to ensure that we should present a united front on doubtful and controversialissues, and that any differences of point of view suchas on first consideration of-any question naturallypresent themselves should be discussed and harmonisedbetween ourselves previously.    There.is otherwise aleal danger that separate views once communicatedto the Secretariat General direct will tend to be sustained and that when a crisis arises we may find that we have drifted into divergent and even incompatibleattitudes on some issue the seriousness of which wasnot realised when first it was raised.    Such a result would weaken seriously influence and position of BritishEmpire in international affairs and would hardly fail to react unfortunately on its internal relations.Against such contingency an obvious initial precautionwould be an arrangement that all communications from and to League should go through some common channelor clearing house.    Such a clearing house is beingconstituted as far as various British Governmentdepartments are concerned in the shape of a branchof
of the Cabinet Secretariat,    It is suggested that this branch might bo similarly made use of ad interim byDominion Governments if or all communications oither waywithout prejudice to future arrangements.    This would ensure at any rate each part cf the Empire being fully informed of policy of other parts before its own views are formally communicated to Secretariat General.Something further would seem to be required however tofacilitate arrival at agreement on common policy by providing some method of personal exchange of views and discussion so helping to mitigate some of the delay and difficulty involved in endeavouring to deal with this problem purely by separate correspondence between sixor seven separate Governments.    This requirement wouldbe mot it is suggested if each Dominion appointed arepresentative here for purposes of League of Nations.Such representative need not necessarily be a Minister,as was contemplated in Imperial Cabinet Resolution, buta responsible person able to form judgment on points a tissue and make recommendations to his Government with aview to securing common caurse of action after consulta-tion with his fellow representatives.Should be grateful for expression cf yourMinisters&apos; views cn above suggestions as early as possible and for any additional or alternative suggestions theymay desire to make&apos;.
