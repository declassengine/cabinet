(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BEITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)6SECRET.CP.416.        ................. CABINET.MINORITY REPRESENTATION.Memorandum by Sir A, Mond.To the Cabinet,The Spen Valley Election is another instance of what has now become more a rule, rather than an exception, of thereturn of the Labour candidate, who has polled a minority vote.With the obvious increase in the number of candidates to three or more for every election, it is&apos; quite clear that, unless theGovernment introduces legislation which will enable the majorityof electors in a constituency either by Proportional Representationor by the Alternative Vote to express a definite final decision,the country will run the risk of being governed by members repre-aenting a minority of the electors in a constituency.   This is entirely incompatible with any true view of democratic government.To my mind, it is a really very grave and serious danger to theState.   &quot;We run the risk of either being governed by Labour, orof Labour obtaining so great a representation in the House ofCommons as .to practically control any Government in Office,   jifLabour obtained representation directly through a majority of votes in each constituency, however disagreeable it would be, noexception can be taken, but when, election after election Labuarobtains election in the constituencies simply because no machineryhas been created by which a majority of electors can return amember who does not agree with the Labour Party, a most seriousnational danger arises.It may be argued that the proper method for dealing withthe problem is for the Anti-Labour Party in the country to unitein a definite new Party,   As a.1 of us with any practicaly exper-ience of the present electoral position in the constituenciesrealise   it is practically impossible to hiring this   a boat suffi-ciently soon to avert the danger in the immediate future.   Itwould be much easier for the Coalition to arrange for its members to support each other either by Alternative Votes or proportional representation thun to abandon either their own organisations orcandidates in favour of some new form of Party.   People in thiscountry are extremely tenacious of old Party associations and theonly tendency in the constituencies now is for both the conservative and Liberal working men to swing over to Labour if their ownPaity candidate is not in the running.   If flome system of alterna-tive choice is created, by which Liberals and Conservatives willhave satisfied their desire to try and get their own man in, itwill be much easier to come to some kind of arrangement.The rejection of the Alternative Vote was largely dueto a mistake in tactics, just as the rejection of proportional representation was c blunder of the first magnitude.   Personally,I believe Proportional Representation is the onlj real solution &apos;of the political problem of to-day and it is being rapdily adoptedin all other democratic countries.   The objections to Proportional
Representation are largely found in the imagination ofPolitical Agents, who are the worst guides in any bigpolitical principle, and by members of Parliament who willnot understand that our political life has changed and thatthe old two Party system has ceased to exist and will neverreturn.   The whole trend of the present electioneeringis more and more to drive the older and more experiencedmen out of political life.   Proportional Representationcreates a form of political stability, by which the exper-experienced men of established position can be reasonablyassured of a continuance of political existence.   Propor-tional Representation creates a wide   field   of appeal andwould make trie possibility of a now Coalition Party muchgreater than it can be under the present system.   It wouldgive electors over a wide area - of whom there are a good many, especially outside the strong Party Caucuses, whowould like to soe a form of Coalition Government continued -the chance of selecting members who hold the same views.In my opinion, the influence of the local caucus would bemuch diminished and this is of particular importance toLiberal Coalition members at present.   I would very stronglyurge upon my colleagues that this whole question which,to my mind, is the key-stone to the future political stability in this country should be thoroughlyexplored with a view ofurgent legislation being carried through during the next session.(Sgd)   ALFRED MOND.H.I.I. Office of Works,7th January 1920.
