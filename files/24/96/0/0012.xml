This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET. \ i ^to. (V r ..THE CABINET.SITUATION IN THE NEAR EAST.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.      -I circulate to my colleagues the following telegram received by, the Chief of theImperial. General Staff from the Commander-in-Chief, India.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.7 th January, 1920.-1-Telegram.From the Commander-in-Ohief, India, to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Despatched 1st January, 1920.Received 2nd January, 1920.1. We consider it desirable to give you our appreciation and obtain your views on situations in Near East as it contains so large an element of uncertainty and appears tobe developing so rapidly to our disadvantage.2. Following are disquieting features of the present: (i.) Growth of Pan-Turanian movement and its alliance with Bolshevism. Thereis evidence that German brains are behind this alliance.(ii.) Turkish animosity. Much power still exercised by the CUP. Mustapha-kemal commands large army in Anatolia and is in constant communication withEnver and Nuri in Azerbaijan. Admission of Greek and Italian claims in Smyrna, &amp;c,has hardened Turkish feelings and failure to support Armenians has further strengthenedtheir hands.(iii.) Unrest among Arabs. This seems likely to develop further, contributingfactors being Emir Faisal&apos;s attitude towards cession of Syria to French, and fact thatDeir-es-Zor incident immediately followed our withdrawal from Syria. Incursion ofImams troops into Aden Protectorate and imprisonment of Jacob&apos;s Mission are alsoindications that Turkish influence is still existent in Arabia.(iv.) Continued failure of Denikins operations and risings in Georgia, Daghestanand Azerbaijan.(v.) Approach of Bolsheviks towards Krasnovodsk which threatens to give themaccess to oil fields, direct communication with Azerbaijan Republic and facilities forattacking Denikin in rear and for entering Persia.(vi.) Afghan intrigues with Bolsheviks.3. Regarding (vi.), following results have been produced as far as we know : (a.) Reception of two Bolshevik Missions at Kabul and Afghanistan Mission at moscow.(6.) Appointment of Afghan Consuls in Russian Turkestan.(c.) Some form of agreement to hand back Panjdeh Kushk area to Afghanistan.(d.) Promises of arms, aeroplanes and an armoured car to Afghanistan.(e.) Some form of military and political agreement, details of which are at presentunknown, but which is believed to include permission for Bolshevik forces to move through Afghanistan. ,(/.) Presence of Afghan troops on Merv Kushk line.(g.) Rapprochement between Afghanistan and Turcomans.(/.) and ((/&apos;) have led to Bolshevik apprehension of intentions (?) of Afghanistan,and to ideas in Turkestan that British are inspiring Afghan activities.    We have(B20/50)  70  l/20  H&amp;S  7850wo01601124
against this, public statement of Afghan Consuls in Turkestan that in order to freeAsia from British yoke Afghanistan is now ready to join Bolsheviks.4. Anglo-Persian agreement has committed us to support Persia; owing toindifferent and lengthy communications, Persia is ill-adapted to military operations, andour forces at Meshed and Kasvin are too small to repel Bolsheviks incursions in forceand too widely separated to combine. For a considerable time Persian military forces will not be organized.Recent decision to suspend payment of, Persian Cossacks may mean further anti-British movement. Attitude of country (?) itself is satisfactory at present and reports indicate the presence of British and Indian troops is generally welcomed, but should we prove ourselves incapable to cope effectually with Bolshevik invasion Persian feelingmight readily change.   In this lies our danger.5. Bolshevik intentions are not yet clear, but they have announced intention of driving us out of Persia and attempt may be made with or without Afghan assistance.The rich food supplies of Khorassan are in any case a tempting bait to starvingTurkestan. Mallesons force is inadequate and badly placed at Meshed to resistcombined Bolshevik-Afghan attack, and would probably have to retire to Birjand orNeh (?) that is even further south; It is 600 miles from railhead, is maintained by1,000 (?) Persian hired camels and difficult roads necessitate reinforcements moving upin small echelons only. We could not at present maintain aeroplanes there, and secretary of State informed us that sanction for supply of necessary personnel andequipment for this purpose from home had not been obtained. Largest force ofregulars we could maintain at Meshed is one mixed brigade, all arms. situation would improve by extension of railway to north of Neh Shusp, and we would againurge importance we attach to this.6. Bolsheviks would have great facilities for invading Persia given control ofCaspian. Transport and supply difficulties attendant on advance by land would ,be avoided; (one group undecipherable) would assist disembarkation ; Persian Cossacksmight join them; line of advance to Teheran would be shortened: and our /force atMeshed and Kasvin would be neutralized by subsidiary movement from Tabriz andKhorassan border respectively. Length and difficulty of communications prohibitprovision of adequate military reinforcements. Therefore, unless General Denikinretains control of Caspian and part of Caucasus or our treaty of peace with Turkeyis such as attracts Turks to our side, only possible solution appears to be to assumenaval control of Caspian ourselves ,by sending naval personnel and guns throughMesopotamia to Enzeli as was done in 1918. You can say whether our control of black Sea would enable us to send aeroplanes, airships or seaplanes to co-operate.We have no sufficient information here to say whether it would be possible to sendforce to Baku, via Batum and Tiffis, but after capture of Krasnovodsk main Bolshevikeffort may be directed against General Denikin&apos;s force, via Baku, on line Petrovsk Vladikavkas.7. Waziristan is being settled with on North-West Frontier, but Afridis still holdaloof, and Afghan intrigues are rife amongst frontier tribes with apparent object of keeping unrest alive, strengthen Amirs hands in negotiations with us or even possiblytill Bolshevik Pan-Islamic schemes have further developed towards a concerted anti-British rising. Question of Afghan policy of mediation before Government of Indiaand General Staff have submitted note urging advisability and danger of delay insevering with A.mir and of early action to detach him from Bolshevik andPan-Islamic alliance. The majority of Afghan nation, they consider, could only be induced by wave of religious feeling such as Pan-Islamic rising to acquiesce in warwith us, and they think that Amir in meantime is merely trying to bluff us; in thatif he were given clearly to understand now that war with us means gas and aerial bombardment, followed in our own time by advance into his country and rectification offrontier as we desire it, he would be forced to submit by public opinion. Steps wouldbe taken to acquaint Afghan public with our intentions by aerial propaganda, andit is believed that we should receive support from strong anti-Amanulla factions in country.8. For operations on all areas likely to be effected, War Office is in great partresponsible, and we should like early indication of plan contemplated should situationdepicted above take a turn for the worse. We are particularly anxious to receivewarning now of what assistance India is likely to be called upon to provide, as government of India are pressing for early disbandment of surplus units now returning from overseas. You will realize that Indian Army is war weary and that few units areup to pre-war standard owing to almost total absence of British officers of between
5 and 15 years&apos; service. Officers of 5 years&apos;service and under are not trained up topre-war standard for open warfare, and this accentuates our difficulties greatly indealing with frontier tribes, while 2 or 3 senior officers per unit are insufficient to counter balance disadvantages. If Indian personnel are to remain contented leave isessential. As you know, British troops are inmature and untrained, and are not likelybefore next autumn to be fit for frontier campaign. Whole army requires rest forrecuperation and reorganization.9. You will understand Government of India have not as yet come to any decision inparagraph 7 and 8 above.
