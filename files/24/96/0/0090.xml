(THIS TjOGUH^PT IS THfl PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAW1IC MAJESTY1?. GQirRM).[To ;t .CP,490.CABINET,,PROTECTION-..Memorandum by the Chairman of the Supply and.Transport Committee.,I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to theserious position in regard to protection, which was discussed at the last meeting of the Supply and Transport Committeeon January 15th.The Committee had before them a report of tho ProtectionSub-Committee which had been brought to their notice bythe Home Secretary* and a memorandum by the Chief of theImperial General Staff whtoh had been circulated by theSecretary, of State for War (CP.472)*    The former documentdealt in detail with the police and special constables,and its conclusions were, briefly, that while in certainrural and residential districts a sufficient number ofspecial constables could be obtained to afford fairly cod protection, it would be impossible elsewhere in theevent of industrial trouble to induce men of the working class to serve as special constables even i$ enrolled now^The number of special constables would therefore be. smallin.those areas in which the need for them was greatest.The. protection which could be given by police and special constables was thus considered to be for short of ?hat ircasdesired, and likely to prove far less effective than that given by the police and military during the Railway strike in September 1919 and tho Sub-Committee recorded theirstrong opinion that in the event of a similar or largerstrike arrangements for protection, which depended fortheir efficiency upon the police and special constabulary,would be dangerously Inadequate, and that even in the case
of a localised strike, tho assistance given by tho special constabulary would not meet tho situation.The memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff (CP.478) pointed outfc among other things,, that the weakness of the Army prohibits its employment except as amilitary force to he used in the last extremity, and thatany premature dispersal of it on protection duties would seriously weaken its capabilities in this respect.At the meeting of tho Supply and Transport Committee,particular emphasis was laid on the weakness of the army to deal with any trouble which might arise.     It was stated that there are at present only two battalions in thewhole of Scotland, although eight battalions were stationed in Glasgow alone during the rioting there last year.     Thereare only throa battalions for the Yorkshire district.These five battalions consist chiefly of young andinexperienced boys.    The Committee entirely agree withthe contention of the Chief of the Imperial General staff that the Army should not be dispersed, but should be held as a central reserve ready to deal with definiterevolutionary outbreaksj   although the latter policy willnot preclude the use of such troops as are available indistricts whore rioting occurs.    These, however, will notbe many.    Iff therefore, the bulk of the Army Is holdan a central reserve the duty of maintaining civil ordergenerally during a large strike will rest with the police and the special constabulary, and it is clear that thepolice and special constabulary are not sufficiently strong for this purpose.In considering this matter, the Cabinet will nodoubt boar in mind the possibility of a coal strike thisspring.     I understand that the coal miners are makingcareful preparations for such a strike through their Co-operative Societies, which aim at feeding their members
for a considerable period, and whioh are accumulating stocksof food-    The Minister of Labour has reported that there Isa possibility of a revolutionary outbreak in Glasgow,Liverpool, or London in the early sprang,, when a definiteattempt may be made to seize the reins of Government.    in normal circumstances the chances of success of such anattempt would probabiy be small, but the danger would, inmy opinion, be serious if the attempt were made when thecountry1s resources had already been taxed by the strain ofa great industrial crisis, such as a strike of coal miners.It is not inconceivable that a dramatic and successful coupd^etat in some large centre of population might win thesupport of the unthinking mass of labour, exasperated as thelatter is by the increasing cost and difficulty of living.What measures should be taken is a question which shouldreceive the most careful consideration.    I am not preparedmyself to make any definite proposals but the question has been examined by the Home Office and I attach a memorandum by sir edward Troup which the Home Secretary has. approved, suggesting the creation of a temporary volunteer force, of at least10,000 men for a period of, say, six or eight months.     Ibring this suggestionj with the permission of the HomeSecretary^ to the notice of the Cabinet, and request that thewhole matter may be discussed at a very early date aI should add that before any public steps are takento deal with the matter, it might be well to summon ameeting of Mayors of provincial cities and ascertain from them how far they are prepared to create skeleton organisationslocally for dealing with civil disturbances when they occur,such skeleton organisations to be of a secret nature.(Sd)    Eric Geddes.Ministry of TransportsJanuary 23rd 1920*
Enclosure *SECRET *PROTSC T I 0 H.The Home Secretary submits for consideration the suggestions contained in the following memorandum.They proceed on the assumption that the position is so serious that, in the opinion of the Government,measures to meet the danger must be taken openly.Memorandum by Sir T. Troup.As a result of the discussion on&apos;Protection inSupply and Transport Committee last Thursday, it appearsthat the weakness arises, not from any failure on thepart of the civil authorities * the&apos; police are strongerand the Special Constabulary better organised and morecapable of expansion than before - but because the army is so reduced that It cannot give the support which it has given In every big strike since 1911.This Is In present circumstances inevitable.Conscription cannot be re-introduced and without it theArmy must remain weak until its numbers are brought upby voluntary recruiting, as they may be (it was stated)towards the aid of the year.In these circumstances it is suggested that duringthe period of weakness the military forces in thiscountry might be- strengthened by a volunteer force,recruited expressly for the purpose of the maintenanceof internal peace.     If a mobile force of only 10,000infantry, composed of men who have already served,could be raised, it would be of material value.    Thereis prestSnably a sufficient supply of competent officersnow demobilised who would be available for such a force:and, if it were made clear that services limited to(say) six or eight months and to this country, probably319
ten thousand men could be raised - possibly a much larger number.    The Chief Constable of Cornwall in a recent report said there were 1,000 ex^aoldi^rs in Cornwalldrawing unemployment pay, who, if paid sufficiently, wouldsmake good Special Constables,   and no doubt msny of them would serve for a few months in a Home Army.There are objections of course -(1)   It might be regarded as a provocative measure,and would be attacked by the Labour Press.    ThatIs an objection to any Scheme that may be adopted to meet the danger if it goes beyond secretpreparations.     It is understood that the committee thought that this position should bo faced.(2)   It might to some extent draw on men who wc-jldotherwise be Special Constables-    But such men would be of much more use in an organised and armed force than as mere specials.(3)   It might affect recruiting to the Army.    But itis not likely to do so if it were confined to menwho had seized and had not volunteered for furthergeneral service.(4)   There would be some danger that It would containmen who would not act against     . Trade Unionistsbut probably men of that class would not wi sh tojoin, or, if they did, could be eliminated.The advantages of such a force over the abandoned civicguards are that It would be (1) armed, (2) availableanywhere, (3) organised and controlled as a military force,(4/ not recruited, as the civic guards inevitably svouldhave been, exclusively from the &quot;middle classes&quot;.    Therewould be no question of &quot;military taint&quot; - the cry used against the civile tfuardc^   it would be avowedly a military force to supplement the reduced Home Array for a limited period. &apos;% -2-As special constables they could only be employed inCountv,, not where needed?. -
Such a force should not interfere in any way withthe further efforts which must be made to complete theorganisation of the Special Constabulary, and prepare fortheir expansion when the actual outbreak of trouble gives the necessary stimulus to recruiting(Initialled)    E, T.19.1*20,General Macready has seen this Memorandum and concurs.!
