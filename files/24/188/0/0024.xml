Printed for the Cabinet, August, 1927.SECRET. &quot;........ein    - Gopy-iNo.     3 0p.P. 226 (27)THE CABINET.REDUCTION OF FORCE IN THE FAR EAST.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1 circulate a note by the General Staff on the reduction of the British forces in the     120 Far East!&apos; Far East616L. W.-E.The War Office,19$ August, 192;Note by the Genekal Staff.1. In CP. 216, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff recommended that our Forces in the Far East should be reduced by 5 infantry battalions, 1 field artillery &quot;brigade, and such portions of the divisional troops transport company and other administrative services as were&apos; not required for domestic purposes. He also pointed out that a considerable reduction in staffs could be effected if his&apos; recommendations were agreed to.2. In telegram No. 5 dated 5th August, 1927, these proposals were referred to Sir Miles Lampson. &apos; At the same time the&apos; policy of His Majesty&apos;?&apos; Government regarding the use of troops was set out as being :  (a) The mission of the Force is solely protective and for this reason, only, we retain troops in China.(J)) From a political point of view, they see no advantage in maintaining a number of troops in China in excess of military necessity.3. Sir Miles Lampson in his reply to the above telegram stated that both the Naval Commander-in-Chief and General Duncan considered that, after the reductions had been made, the force remaining would be sufficient to secure British lives and property. Sir Miles Lampson, however, deprecated any reduction in excess of 2 battalions, on the score that it would weaken his hands diplomatically.4. Since the recommendations contained in CP. 216 were discussed by the Cabinet and referred to and a reply received from Sir Miles Lampsou, two fresh points have arisen : (a) The Colonial Office wish to be assured regarding the safety of Wei-hai-Wei.(b) The Admiralty ask fKiit&apos; tne^witTidrawal oT&quot; the Marine battalion should have priority over that of other troops.5. As regards Wei-hai-Wei, the battalion was sent there, in place of the normal garrison of one platoon, at a time when the wave of the Nationalist armies was sweeping northwards through Shantung, and it seemed possible that this wave might stretch into the leased territory- This danger no longer exists, neither is an organized attack on the part of a Chinese army to be anticipated. According to the Naval Commander-in-Chief, a whole battalion, with the co-operation of a few seaplanes, is the maximum number of troops that is necessary to hold the leased territory against any force that is likely to attempt to break through. The retention of a whole battalion at Wei-hai-Wei can therefore no longer be justified from a security point of view.(b27/17)   100  8/27   w.o.p.   3238
Although the recommendations contained in CP. 216 advocated the withdrawal of the battalion from Wei-hai-Wei, it was not intended that that place should be entirely denuded of troops but that the battalion should be replaced by a smaller garrison. The size of this garrison cannot definitely be estimated without reference to General Duncan at a date when the witiidrawal of the battalion is imminent, but, whatever the size advocated, there will be sufficient troops remaining in the Far East after the reductions have been made to provide it.The indifferent accommodation and intemperate climate do not admit of a whole battalion remaining at Wei-hai-Wei during the winter months.6. As regards the withdrawal of the Marine battalion, the recommendations made in CP. 216 were not based on the availability of this battalion for security purposes. Although the General Staff have been confident that the Naval Commander-in-Chief would place this battalion at the disposal of General Duncan for purely army purposes should a situation arise demanding immediate reinforcements, they have always realised the possibility that the Naval Commander-in-Chief might be employing it on other duties, and that it would be unsafe to calculate on its always being available.The General Staff would, however, be averse to the withdrawal of all Marines from China as they are invaluable for minor amphibious operations such as have recently been carried out at Nanking and for which soldiers are less fitted. The General Staff can offer no opinion as to the number of Marines that might be retained; they hope, however, that unless there are sufficient naval ratings, belonging to rhe 1st Cruiser Squadron and other ships now in the Far East, for such amphibious operations as the Naval Com-mander-in-Chief considers he may be called upon to carry out, a portion of the Marine battalion may be retained in China for these purposes.7. To sum up, the General Staff consider that neither the security of Wei-hai-Wei nor the withdrawal of the Marine battalion affects the recommendations put forward in CP. 216, which were subsequently concurred in by the local naval and military authorities, and to which the General Staff still adhere. They request that, as the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to use troops for security purposes only and to maintain none that are in excess of military necessity, authority may now be given to withdraw five infantry battalions, one field artillery brigade, and such portions of the divisional troops transport company and other administrative services as are not required for domestic purposes. They also request authority to reduce and reorganise staffs consequent on the proposed reduction of the Force and to use the &quot; Herminius &quot; for the conveyance of the troops that are to be withdrawn.The War Office,August, 1927.
