SECRET. soO.P. 231 (27.)ADEN HINTERLAND :  OBLIGATIONS TO TRIBES.(Memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.)1. AT the meeting of the Cabinet held on the 6th July, 1927, it was resolved &quot; that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should circulate to the Cabinet a summary of our obligations to the tribes in the Aden hinterland.&quot; The required information is summarised in the following paragraphs : 2. The treaty engagements entered into with the tribes of the Aden hinterland are generally of three types.3. The first contains a provision extending the gracious favour and protection of His Majesty to the territory of the ruler, and an undertaking by the ruler to refrain from correspondence or treaty relations with any foreign Power and from ceding, leasing or mortgaging territory to a foreign Power. This type of treaty was entered into with the rulers of the following tribes : Name.	Date of Treaty.	Position of Tribe.	Alawi       . ...	1895	In occupation of Imam.

The second type is a treaty of peace and friendship, and provides for the protection of the trade routes in return for a stipend, in addition to the provisions included in the first type. [16600]

The treaty concluded in 1849 with the Sultan of Lahej, the most important of the rulers in the Protectorate, is a treaty&apos; of peace and commercial intercourse, and contains no promise of protection from His Majesty&apos;s Government; but a subsequent agreement, entered into with the Sultan in 1882, provides that the territories of the Sultan, his heirs and successors Bhall remain under British protection as heretofore.Colonial Office, August 30, 1927.W.
