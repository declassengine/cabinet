aegis DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVBRIgJBMT):RET Copy No. 30P, 216     &quot;   (27) CABINET.TROOPS    IN   CHINA. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for -7ar.I attach a note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff advising that the Force in China may now be reduced byjagt       5 Infantry Battalions and 1 Field Brigade Royal Artillery and,5some ancillary units.I ask for Cabinet sanction to the proposed reductions in the course of the autumn.27th July, I927.
H0TE BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GEESRAL staff.     I have further considered the number of british reinforcements now in China and have come to the following conclusions, whioh are based on military considerations only.2.     At the 299th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Foreign Secretary suggested that the danger to &quot;be assumed should, be oommensurate with that which now obtains, i.e.   mob violence but no organized opposition on the part of a Chinese Army.3.     Acting on this premise, there seems no reason to retain units which are primarily of use for field operations but of less value for the purpose of keeping law and order among a mob.     My first recommendation, therefore, is that the Field Artillery Brigade, and suoh portion of the Divisional Troops Transport Company as is not required for domestic purposes, can be withdrawn.     The former can go to India.in the Autumn in the ordinary course of relief.-   4,     When the Shanghai Defence Force was first despatched with the primary object of defending Shanghai, opposition on the part of a Chinese Army was anticipated. One of the duties allotted to this force was, therefore, to protect our nationals against this danger and prevent .any Chinese Army from entering the Settlement.     For this reason, the perimeter had to be defended, entailing the employment of a considerable portion of the force.     The danger to whioh our nationals are now expoaed is mob violence from within the Settlement only;   the occupation of the perimeter is, therefore, no longer necessary.5*     In the above remarks, I have made reference to Shanghai only, but they apply also to ITorth China, where mob violence is, eo far as one can anticipate, the only danger that need be apprehended.
.6.     Reviewing the two areas which are our prime responsibility as regards protection, i.e. Shanghai and Tientsin, I aa of opinion that the garrisons for -(a)    Shanghai can now be reduced to a maximum of 5 Infantry battalions and 1 armoured car company, and that in order to give greater defensive powor to the infantry battalions, the machine gun platoons should be increased to 12 guns.C9)   North China should remain at 2 infantry battalions one of whioh forms the normal peace garrison, and their machine gun platoons should be similarly increased.In view of the everchanging situation in China, it would be unwise not to retain a reserve. I reconnend that this should be constituted and located as under:-Hong Kong ...... 2 battalions and 1 light brigade, R.A.7.     Exclusive oS the normal garrisons (and also of the Indian Contingent which it has already been decided to withdraw), there are now the following British troops in the Far East:-13 infantry battalions. 1 field brigade, R.A. 1 light brigade, R.A. 1 armoured oar company.If my recommendations are agreed to, these numberscan be materially reduced and the number and location of our troops in the Ear East, including normal garrisons, wouldthen be:-Shanghai...... 5 infantry battalions and 1 armoured car company.Hong Kong ...... 4 infantry battalions and 1 lightbrigade, R.A. including one Indian battalion of the normal garrison.Tientsin...... 2 battalions.8,     Our troops surplus to the above requirements would amount to 5 infantry battalions, 1 field brigade, R.A, and suoh portions of the divisional troops transport company and other administrative servioos aB are not required for domestic purposes,
I recommend that authority be given to withdraw this surplus, the withdrawal to bo gradual and completed by the end of this year.9.     As regards the various headquarters now in the Par East, I propose that General 33unoan with a modified staff should continue for the present to command the forces at Shanghai and in North China.     The G.O.C.Hong Kong and the Colonel Commandant, North China, will continue their normal duties, their forces being au^aented to the strengths given in paragraph 7,     One Brigade Commander and staff will remain to command the troops in Shanghai, whilst the withdrawal of the 13th Infantry Brigade and of the surplus troops from hong Kong will admit of the reduction of 2 infantry brigade headquarters.10.     So far I have treated the subject from the purely General Staff point of view.     The financial state of affairs is wall known to you.     Prom the administrative point of view it is essential to know, at a very early date, the number of battalions we have to retain in the Ear East. This is due to the presence in large numbers of Section &apos;A&apos; Reservists in the 15th Infantry Brigade.     If this Brigade is to be retained in China beyond tnis year, these reservists must either be replaced or the battalions left at so low a strength as to deprive them of much of their military value.     Although a bounty has been offered to those who volunteer to remain on, I doubt this inducement being responded to to any appreciable extent, as &apos;life&apos; in China is peculiarly unattractive.Prom all points of view, therefore, I consider the reductions rscommended in paragraph   should be carried out beforo the end of this year, and that the battalions to be withdrawn should be those of the 13th Infantry Brigade plus ons extra battalion to ho selected.27th July, 192?.
