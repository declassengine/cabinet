24UPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1927.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 238 (27).CABINET.30THE FUTURE OF BRITISH COMMERCIAL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1.   A NUMBER of factors point to the need for an early review of our present Need for an early civil aviation policy not least the dynamic state of commercial air transport        of abroad under progressive (I might almost say aggressive) direction and the fertilis- aTia 10n po lcy&quot; ing influence of a stream of subsidies which, even in those countries whose finances are most straitened, are being largely augmented from year to year.   Our own commercial air services have indeed made steady, if modest, progress in certain directions in recent years.  In comparison, however, with developments abroad, there is no doubt that they have been held back, despite technical and commercial management of the first order, by a stringency of finance which is intensified by our present diminishing subsidy scheme.   They are in consequence, if this handicap is not removed, likely at best to remain in a relatively static condition, the continuance of which we can hardly contemplate with equanimity.I am therefore anxious to place the facts of the position before my colleagues and take their advice. For whilst I am satisfied that the broad lines of our present policy are sound, I am equally clear, in the light of the events of the past three or four years, that, if we are not to be left hopelessly behind in one of the most striking departments of twentieth century progress, some modification of this policy is essential.2. The Cabinet will recollect that our cardinal objective has always been to Outline of existing place civil air transport on a commercial basis and make it self-supporting as early i^periarAiJwaygi as possible. In pursuit of this objective we are to-day subsidising a single company Imperial Airways which was brought into being in 1924 by the amalgamation of the four independent air transport undertakings which had previously existed. This amalgamation was effected in pursuance of the recommendations of a committee presided over by Sir Herbert Hambling, whose report was presented to Parliament in 1923 (Cmd. 1811). I may mention that Germany has recently followed our example and instituted a similar merger, the product of which is the highly efficient and successful organisation known as the &quot; Luft Hansa.&quot;There are two main agreements current with Imperial Airways. The first covers the operation of services in Europe and provides for payment of a total subsidy of  1,000,000 over a period of ten years. This subsidy is on a tapering scale, decreasing from  137,000 in the first year to  32,000 in the tenth year. It is contingent on the completion of a specified minimum annual mileage, and is repayable out of profits. This agreement has been in operation for just over 3i years, and the first of the progressive diminutions in the subsidy is due to take place next spring.The second agreement was concluded in October 1926, and provides for the operation of a service (fortnightly in the first instance, though the company under-takes to use its best endeavour to establish a weekly service in due course) between Egypt and India. This agreement covers a five-year period, and the maximum annual subsidy payable is  93,600. As my colleagues are aware, I made what was to have been the opening flight of this service from Cairo to Karachi in January this year. Unfortunately, however, it has proved impossible to put it into regular operation, owing to a sudden volte-face by the Persian Government, who have repudiated a provisional agreement made with them, and refuse to allow our aircraft to fly over or land on Persian territory. The first section between Cairo and Basrah is, however, being operated weekly with regularity, and traffic returns to date are satisfactory and augur well for the future. I am investigating a possible alternative route for the section Basrah-Karachi along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf.[16663]
Services subsidised by the Imperial Exchequer at pra-sent in operation.Comparison of British, French and German commercial air serrices, routes, mileage, &amp;c.Comparison of British, French and German expenditure on oivil aviation as a whole and on subsidies.3. Such, in outline, are the present agreements governing British civil aviation in so far as concerns services subsidised by the Imperial Exchequer. The maximum , total subsidies payable to Imperial Airways under both agreements in 1928 will be in the neighbourhood of  205,000, and this amount will, under the provisions of the first agreement, diminish annually thereafter.In return for these subsidies Imperial Airways are at present operating the following services: 	Frequency.

Closed down. Dailv.     &apos; Weekly.Outside Europe.		Cairo-Basrah	Weekly	Weekly.Services in the Dominions and Colonies not subsidised by the Imperial Exchequer.4. These represent the sum total of regular British commercial air services at present in operation, apart from local services being run in and at the expense of the Dominions or Colonies. The only items worthy of note under this head are the very successful services being operated in Australia and an experimental service between Khartoum and Kisumu. As regards the former the Australian Government is, in view of the striking success which has attended the existing services, embarking on a bold and progressive policy of expansion, in pursuance of which they have recently decided to expendji further  200,000 annually on the establisnment and operation of additional services to cover new routes extending. over some 4,500 miles. The Khartoum-Kisumu service is being financed jointly by the Governments of Kenya, Uganda and the Sudan on the one hand, and the operating company on the other; no part of the cos,t is being borne by the Imperial Exchequer. It is to be limited in the first instance to 12 experimental flights&apos; in each direction, and the service, which had to be postponed owing to some initial mishaps, has just been resumed.5. The services detailed in paragraph 3 represent routes of a length of about 2,300 miles; they employ some 20 machines, and the average weekly mileage is in the neighbourhood of 21,000 miles.The corresponding figures for France and Germany are in striking and some-what depressing contrast.  For convenience I set them out below in tabular form.Length of    Mileage flown     Aircraft routes. weekly.        employed.Great Britain ... ...      2,300       21,182 2*france ... ...      8,304       74,944       300Germany        ... ...     14,000      180,000        1676. The figures for the sums voted annually for civil aviation generally and in particular for the subsidising of commercial air services are equally striking, as is shown in the subjoined comparative table.Civil Aviation Expenditure and Subsidies voted for Commercial Air transport in 1927-28.Civil Aviation Expenditure as a Whole. Subsidies.Great BritainFranceGermany 481,100  1,571,157 ( 7,724,960)*  2,136,756Great Britain France ... Germany   ... 230,600i.&apos;634,274 ( 3,118,557)*  963,415f&quot;The sterling equivalents of the French and German figures are at current rate of exchange. Owing to the wide divergence between the current rate and par in the case of the franc, the par figure is given in brackets; a figure about half-way between the par and current rates would probably give a more accurate idea of actual French expenditure. &apos;     &apos;      &quot;t This figure represents subsidies payable by the Reich alone, and is exclusive of financial assistance given by&apos; local Governments and municipal authorities, which appears to amount to upwards of  350,000 per annum.
Ambitious character of the civil aviation policy of foreign Powers.&apos; British air estimates alone have been reduced in reoent years ; the estimates of foreign Powers havo tended steadily upwards year by year, both absolutely and in relation to Govern-Government expenditure as a whole the total sums voted for subsidies by France and Germany since 1919 are also largely in excess of our own expenditure under this head.I refrain from quoting figures for the United States in view of the great difference in economic conditions in America, but they also indicate a determination to ensure an early and vigorous development of this new form of transport.7. The above comparative figures show the extent to which foreign Powers have already pursued a progressive policy and that without stinting finance.Nor are they content to rest oh their laurels, but further&apos; ambitious projects are germinating on every hand, and in some cases have already matured. For example, a few days ago I received official information that the French Govern-ment have decided on the payment, subject to Parliamentary sanction, of a further subsidy of  314,500 per annum (at current rate of exchange) for the operation of a service between West Africa and South America-aw addition which in itself repre-sents a sum 50 per cent, in excess of the total maximum subsidies payable next year from the British Exchequer under present arrangements.Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity of drawing my colleagues&apos; attention to the fact that alone of the Great Powers we have in the past year or two curtailed our air expenditure as a whole. Recognising the stringency of our economic position, I have, though not without misgiving, by dint of paring and pruning in every direction, effected reductions on such a scale that gross air estimates for 1927 are no less than  1,350,000 below those of 1925. There has been a good deal of public criticism of these reductions, but I have felt able to make them in the confidence that our sj&apos;stem of air organisation with its concentration of all air activities (service and civil) in the hands of one department, so that there is no overlapping or dissipation of effort, has enabled us to produce so good an article that the Royal Air Force makes up in quality for what it lacks in &quot;quantity. The time has come, however, when I must warn the Cabinet that I do not see how this retrograde movement in British air expenditure can continue, when the air estimates of every other first-class Power are progressing steadily upwards, both absolutely and in proportion to national expenditure as a whole. In the past two years we have, as above stated, reduced our air expenditure by 6 per cent.; very different are the figures for the two principal continental Powers. Thus the French are budgeting for a 26 per cent, increase next year on top of an increase of 37 per cent, in 1927, as compared with 1926, whilst in the past three years Italian air estimates have risen by no less than 75 per cent.8. To return, however, to the immediate problem of civil aviation, the figures Recognition of the I have cited show conclusively that, unless we bestir ourselves, Great Britain is, as ^SSS^flw^ I have said, in danger of being left hopelessly behind. British Empire by it seems to me that this is not a state of affairs which we can allow to continue  conference^f 1926 above all when the British Empire, with its possessions scattered the world over, affords a more promising field for air transport, and stands to gain more by its development, than any other Power, a fact to which, I may remind my colleagues, the Imperial Conference of 1926 gave express and emphatic recognition in their published Resolutions.9.   There are, however, other features in the problem, quite apart from the internal considera-march of events abroad, which would in any case, in my judgment, have necessitated ev^ts^broad^nt the reconsideration of our present agreements with Imperial Airways, whose  1 to the need for an shares (15s. paid), despite a very competent management, now stand at between 5s. Briu8h8civu aviation I and 6s.   The principal of these factors are as follows :  policy.(a) As already pointed out, our cardinal objective has throughout been to get civil aviation on a commercial footing as early as possible. This is the end to which the recommendations of the Hambling Committee were directed, and it is on this that my advisers and I have concentrated our efforts during the past four years.I am sure that this policy is sound and in the long run the objective Our present policy attainable.   It is, however, now clear that the Hambling Committee were unduly t^ne^a&quot;10^^ optimistic in their estimates (a) of the amount of Government assistance necessary iight&quot;TTuTthorndata and (b) of the time (10 years) during which such assistance would be required. &quot;&quot;^TaUablf This is no reflection on the foresight and capacity of Sir Herbert Hambling and his fow^wn!0 &amp;S colleagues, to whose labours, indeed, we are greatly indebted.  It was inevitable four years ago that forecasts and estimates should be of a very provisional character owing to the almost total absence of reliable data due to a variety of causes, such as
j Importance of I Imperial routes, as i opposed to restricted I continental semces.Proposal that a small Cabinet Com-mittee be appointedll to consider the problem.Suggested terms of reference.the entire novelty of commercial air transport, which did not come into existence until 1919, and the difficulty of getting reliable financial statistics from companies, some of which combined the manufacture of aircraft with their commercial operation. s Imperial Airways now at last have the requisite operating experience, technical data and traffic statistics to enable us to take stock of the position and frame our future policy in the light of reasoned calculations.(6) Another substantial point which has emerged in recent years is that the future of British commercial air transport lies rather in the development of great trunk lines (with, of course, subsidiary &quot;feeders&quot;) throughout the Empire e.g., England-Egypt-India, England-Egypt-South Africa, rather than in the narrowly restricted field of services upon the continent of Europe. As a result of the unremitting attention which Sir Eric Geddes and Sir George Beharrel have given to the somewhat thankless task of directing the affairs of Imperial Airways, and the efforts of the company&apos;s administrative and technical staff, it has built up on such services as that between London and Paris a valuable goodwill; passengers of whatever nationality show a flattering preference for &quot;travelling British,&quot; and in 1926, for example, despite our small fleet, we carried 61 per cent, of cross-channel passenger traffic in the teeth of keen French, Dutch and Belgian competition. It is, however, clear in the light of experience that it is no more possible to build up a prosperous civil aviation industry on a basis of services to the continent than it would be for cross-channel steamer traffic to maintain our Mercantile Marine. We must, therefore, look further afield. I should perhaps here remark in passing that the &apos;&apos; trunk &apos;&apos; aeroplane lines will not compete with, but be complementary to, the airship lines which I hope to see inaugurated within the next few years. The airship will run non-stop services in stages of 1,000 miles or more, e.g., there are unlikely to be more than two intermediate halts at most between London and Bombay; the aeroplane will stop as and where traffic offers and will operate in stages which may vary accordingly from 100 to 500 miles.10. In the light of these few paragraphs I feel sure my colleagues wall agree that an immediate review of the position and our present policy is called for. We cannot surely rest content with routes whose length is about a quarter and a sixth of those operated bf&quot;Franee and Germany respectively, with a mileage which is in roughly the same ratio, and last but not least, with a commercial air fleet which, however excellent in quality, is quantitatively negligible.I do not wish at this juncture to recommend any specific course of action. Ways and means of improving this state of affairs present a difficult problem in the solution of which I invite my colleagues&apos; advice and co-operation : this could, I suggest, be most helpfulhy forthcoming in the shape of a small Cabinet Committee.I ask the Cabinet, then, to approve the immediate setting up a committee to bring the whole question under review with some such terms of reference as the following : &quot; To review the present position of civil aviation in the British Empire with particular reference to recent developments abroad and to consider and report what modifications of our present policy are desirable and practicable.&quot;I shall be ready to lay before the Committee further data and statistics with which I have not thought it necessary at this stage to trouble the Cabinet.S.
