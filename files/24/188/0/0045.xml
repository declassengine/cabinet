TRADES UHIOK G-CGGRES3 EDINBURGH,  5TH 20 10TH SEPTEMBER, 1927.Questions of general policy, and the attitude of the British trade union movement towards general questions of moment are more and more occupying the time of the Annual meeting of Congress.     This year the first four days were largely taken u;, by a oonaideration of these matters.The most important questions discussed were perhaps:-(aj    The British trade union attitude towards the Russian Trade Union movement.(b) The Prime Minister1s appeal for peace and oo-opera-tion in industry.(c) Methods of Organisation (Industrial, Craft or General).(d) The Trade Union and Trade Disputes Act.(e) Blanesburgh Report on Unemployment Insurance.(f) Question of Tariff on imported goods made under conditions inferior to those existing in this country.(g) The development of International Trusts and Cartels.(h) Factories Bill and the ratification of the Washington Hours Convention.With respect to (a), a special Supplementary Statement was issued to the delegates during the sittings of the Congress which reviewed the negotiations the General Council had had with Russian Trade Union representatives, through the medium of the Anglo-Russian Joint Advisory Council.The Statement showed that two years of patient and earnest striving to bring about an understanding had convinced the General Council that it was impossible to carry on under the present conditions.     The Russian representatives appeared utterly unable to oonoeive of any policy except their own; they made no allowance for difference of national traits, outlook or methods, and resorted to abuse and vdolent dis-agreement if other nations failed to accept their views.     It/was
was necessary to make It clear and definite that, while the British movement would still strive to maintain friendly and mutually helpful relations with the movements in all ether countries, it would insist upon conducting its own affairs in its own way under a policy and aiming at an objective decided by its own people.She acceptance of the Statement was moved by Mr.Citrine, the Seoretary to the General Council, who made a strong and effective speech.     The reference back was moved by Mr.Brown of the Civil Service Clerical Association and seoonded by Mr. Collick of the Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen.     Both made telling speeches and the debate was of a high order. She National Union of Railwayman^ support of the reference hack was voiced by Mr. Cramp and the Miners urged a delay until they could consult their members.     She vote, however, proceeded and was:-Ehe Report was adopted.So outward appearance this rather spectacular decision was momentous as seeming to show a definite break from the aims and policy of revolutionary Mosoow,     In reality, it simply means that British offioial trade-unionism is coming into line with the vast majority of its members, who are in no way revolutionists.     British Trade Unionism is now much where it was before the glameur of Moscow caught a few &apos; prominent leaders.     On the general subjeot of relations with Russia, the Congress carried unanimously a resolution proposed by Mr. Harry Pollitt and seconded by Mr.John Hill, deploring the breaking off of diplomatic relations with Russia and instructing the General Council to press for a Select Committee of the Houso of Commons to investigate tho facts.For the reference back Against620,000 2,551,000/Closely
Closely allied with the decision concerning Russia, as Indications of the generally hostile feeling among trade unions towards the minority and communist movement, was the defeat of proposals to refer back the section of the General Councils report relating to .the circular sent to Trades Councils stating that Congress could not approve affiliation to the Minority Movement, to permit Trades Councils to affiliate to the Trade Union Congress, to oall a joint oongress of the Moscow and Amsterdam Internationals, and to appoint a Commission to consider, inter alia, future methods of trade union organisation, including the question of workers&apos; control, all of whioh were moved by delegates associated with the left wing.On the subject of the relations between employers andemployod the President*s speech, in its support of the methodof conciliation, received much public notice.   Mr.Hicksdevoted much time to a description of the failure of theoapitalist system, to the necessity of greater solidarity inthe organised labour movement to meet the closer organisa-tion of employers, and to the strengthening of their politicalforce with a view to securing a Government which would havethe duty of changing the present state of affairs as regardsthe control of industry and the Forces.     Side by side withthis political development he indicated that the constructiveside of Trade Unionism must be developed, that more and more the workers are.aiming at obtaining a share in the controland administration of industry through Trade Unions and that not until the workers had, by training, fitted themselvesto deal with the problems of management and the conduct ofindustry would they be oapable of controlling Industry.He then added -&quot;And here I should like to say this;   we all know -employers as well as trade unionists - that the/vexatious\-1 ............_______________..._________^^^^^^i^^rM^llllllM^^
vexatious, toilsome, ana diffioult period through v/hioh we are passing is a transitional period.     Much fuller use can be made under these conditions of the machinery for joint consultation and negotiation between employers and employed.     We have not reached the limits of possible development in this direction.     It is more than doubtful whether we have seen the fullest possible development of machinery for joint consultation in particular industries. And practloally nothing has yet been done to establish effeotive machinery of joint conference between the representative organisations entitled to speak for industry as a whole.     There are many problems upon which joint discussion would prove of value at the present time. Such a direct exchange of practical views between representatives of the great organised bodies who have responsibility for the conduct of industry and know its problems at first hand would be of far greater significance than the suggestion which has been made in certain quarters for a spectacular national conference under Government or other auspices to discuss a vaguo aspiration towards &quot;industrial peace&quot;.    Discussion on these lines would bring both sides face to face with the hard realities of the present economic situation and might yield useful results in showing how far and upon what terms co-operation Is possible in a common endeavour to improve the efficiency of industry and to raise the workers1 standard of life.     It is important that our movement should frame a clear-cut and coherent policy on practical lines.     itle should not be deterred by allegation-tions that in entering into such discussion we are , surrendering some essential principle of Trade Unionism. On the contrary, they will lead to a much dearer under-standing on the part of our own organised movement of the immediate practical objectives at whioh we ought to aim and for whioh we are entitled to use the Influence and power with which this Congress is invested&quot;.These words, which are understood to have been drafted in association with other leaders, give official recognition to a policy of settlement of industrial problems by joint discussion directly between organised employers and workers in contrast with more forceful methods.     The reference to the applioation Of this method during a &quot;transitional period&quot;, that is, until by politioal means the unions are given a greater control over industry may be regarded as a concession to those who are hostile to constructive work under a system of private ownership but, taken in oonjunotion with the general tenour of the speeoh, the statement of the President will doubtless be examined in the light of future aotion by those on the other side to whom his words were partly addressed.      It is important, however, to note that the policy suggested was obviously well received by the majority of delegates present who largely consisted of officials in daily contact with industrial problems. /The
The official resolution on the subject of peace In industry was of a less satisfactory character.    This was as follows:-&quot;This Congress, having noted the repeated appeals of the Prime Minister to the leaders of labour on the subject of collaboration for industrial peace, points out that no section of the community is more desirous of industrial peace than the workers.    It Is compelled, however, to inform Mr.Baldwin that the greatest hindrance to a response to these appeals is the legislativo and   Industrial policy pursued by him and his Government and especially their attacks on the wage standards and liberties of the workers, and the deliberate class bias displayed in the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act.    The immediate repeal of such repressive legislation would be the best evidence of the sincerity and honesty of Mr.Baldwin and his Government.    Failing, this Congress declares that the country should be given an immediate opportunity of pronouncing a verdict upon the present Governments policy.&quot;It was moved by Mr.E.Bevin whose remarks were tinged with the hostility In the resolution itself.    In the course of his speech, however, he referred to the faot that while the Press gives great publicity to strikes, for every strike, there are thousands of disputes settled around the conference table which pass unnoticed.    The resolution was seconded by Mr.Thomas and carried by acclamation.The general impression left was that, while due regard was had to the support of the political ends of labour, there was a lead given towards the concentration of trade union effort on the solution of the industrial problems in the various industr5.es by the familiar methods of negotiate::, and that,, for the time being, a halt was called to those who had pursued w5.der and more spectacular policies which had led to dissension and bewilderment.    In other words the ordinary official recognised that the greater national leaders were returning to the realities of the day-to-day/problems
e. 275problems of membership and working conditions In which he was most interested.    The atmosphere created gave clear evidence of the essential soundness of the average trade union leader which is a reflexion of the character of their constituents.The above applies to the whole of the later proceedings of the Congress.     Resolutions, moved on behalf of the Transport and General Workers1 Union, instructing the General Council (a) to prepare a report on the development of international trusts and cartels, their financial policy and wages paid, the restriction of output and the organisation of markets and (b) to advance by means of International organisations a policy aiming at the education of European public  pinion in favour of Europe becoming one economic unity.    The latter which was carried by 2,258,000 to 1,464,000 was proposed by Mr.Ernest Bevin who, as a member of the Government Delegation to the United States and Canada, was personally greatly impressed by the variety of the resources and the great internal market created by the combination of the 48 States%     A resolution moved by an official of the same union directed the General Council to prepare a report on the effect of tariff restrictions on trade and the general effect of dumping in all countries.    A resolution demanding the ratification of the Washington Hours Convention was again passed.    It was also resolved tbat the General Council, in conjunction with the Labour Party, should hold an inquiry into the importation of sweated goods into this country with a view to having a common policy for the political and industrial movements and that they should send a deputation to India to investigate and report on trade union conditions there and to assist in organising the Indian/ Trade
Trade Union Movement.   The evidence of a desire to accumulate facts concerning matters which closoly affect the competitive position of this country is of considerable importance. Individual unions have sent representatives abroad to study industrial conditions and there is no doubt that a stimulus to the collection of more information concerning the position abroad was given by the Government Mission to the United States.      It is. felt that the attendance of delegates at various conferences and conventions abroad has not, in fact, resulted in the collection of the Information concerning foreign conditions which .is now seen to be necessary.There was a considerable debate on the subject of the methods of organisation of workers in trade unions.    In accordance with a decision of the Congress In 1924 that the General Council should examine the problem of organisation by industry the Council made an enquiry and presented a Report to Congress.    This Report referred to the five general classes of organisation (a) craft organisations,  (b) industrial organisations,  (c) occupational organisations,  (d) employmental organisations and (e) general workers1 organisations..    Reference was made to the various opinions as to what determines the boundaries of industry such as (1) the commodity produced or the service rendered, (2) the tool operated,  (3) the employer or group of employers and to the constant changes arising from such causes as technical advances and combinations of undertakings.    The Council found-it impossible to formulate a scheme to take the place of the complex forms of organisa-tions which were the growth of generations-     The Council recommended, however0 that greater co-ordination was essential and that, pending voluntary amalgamations and/other
other methods of consolidation, the necessary co-ordination should he in the hands of the Trades Union Congress through the medium of the General Council.     A motion to refer the Report hack was moved by Mr.J.Tanner of theAmalgamated Engineering Union supported by Mr.Doonan and i&amp;r.A.J.uook of the Miners&apos; Federation both of whom wished to have early and definite unification of industrial organisation and objeoted to leaving developments to proceed gradually-     In support of the Report,, Mr.E.Bevin said that the conservative instincts of the men would not allow any power to determine the union to which they should belong;   the problem could not be solved by framing four-line resolutions.    The reference back was defeated by 2,062,000 to 1,809,000.Opinions of trade union officials which have been heard since the Congress indicate that it is regarded as the most useful Congress of recent years mainly because the discussions had appeared to cloar the way for a closer attention to actual facts and for the operation of a policy of co-operation which is more in keeping with the relations between employers and men In the workshops.    There is also satisfaction that a lead was given for the settlement of industrial problems within the industries themselves.
