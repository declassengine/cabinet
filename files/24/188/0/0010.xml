[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]! 8SECRET. Copy No.       QCP. 210 (2,7).NAVAL CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.BEING unable to attend the Cabinet, I think it right to record my view upon the Geneva Conference for the consideration of my colleagues.1. We should adhere, with more publicity than we have hitherto attained,-to our battleship proposals.2. We should accept parity proposals in the 10,000 tons cruiser class. The lower, of course, the better.3. We should admit the theoretical parity claim of the United States of America in the light cruiser class. But while we admit this we must most resolutely refuse to tie our hands. In this case ostensible parity is actual disparity. If America builds in light cruisers upon a scale which challenges the arteries of this Empire we must respond without examining our financial situation. For, anyhow, that situation will be far worse if America, at a given moment, with (a) a parity in battleships, (b) a parity in 10,000-ton cruisers, (c) a parity in light cruisers, can say to us in a diplomatic quarrel: these are our terms; take them or leave them. In such a situation we become the vassals of the United States of America.I would have nothing to do with aggregate tonnage; it is a dangerous snare. The only safe and sane course is for us to remain faithful to the maritime traditions of our people. These traditions demand that if war break out between ourselves and any other country in the world, or any other reasonably conceivable combination of countries, we shall prove able to maintain the vital arteries of the people whose trustees we are.I should not be in the least alarmed if the Americans made a break on this issue. The conference was their child, not ours. If it fails it is their failure, not ours.And I would add that they cannot exploit that failure much if we can establish common ground with the Japanese. The Japanese ask nothing better. But they have formed the view that we will in no circumstances stand up to the Americans.In my opinion the moment has quite definitely come when we must stand up to them. There are pacifist and Nonconformist forces in America which will not stand for a race in naval armaments if our case is adequately projected over the footlights.Anyhow, the maintenance of our claim to complete freedom in the construction of light cruisers conceding the like freedom to the United States of America is in my judgment essential; and by that I stand or fall.B.[16437]
