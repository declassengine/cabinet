Grant Duff, as I think the Cabinet will be interested iii this vivid picture of actual conditions.A. C.Foreign Office, July If), 1927.(1-)Extract from a Letter from M. de Heidenstam, Siccdish Minister in Moscow, to M. Westman, Head of the Political Department in the Swedish Ministi-y for Foreign Affairs, dated Moscow, June 22, l&apos;J27.(Private.)If I should characterise the situation, here at present I would say that it is scare that iB the most typical feature ; the fear of the Government for the future and for the conseqxiences of the policy that has been inaugurated against S.S.S.JR.; the fear of the arrested who, more or less innocent, await their sentences in the prisons or simply wait without ever being sentenced ; the fear of those of the population who have not yet been arrested but owing to their personal circumstances await such a calamitj^; the fear of all employees that they shall lose their situations and their bread as a result of the financial difficulties; the fear of the peasants for the possibility of a war and, lastly, the fear of G.P.U. that they shall not detect all conspiracies, imaginary or real, and thus not fulfil their enhanced activity for their own ends. As a big black cloud fear is suspended over the whole society and paralysing everything. G.P.U. makes it no secret that in case of new attempts twenty-five hostages, now arrested, will be immediately executed, and if the attempts continue nevertheless, that thousands of men and women will be shot in order to deprive the bourgeoisie of the inclination to repeat the attempts. There is certainly a great amount of exaggeration in this, but such events have evidently their psychological importance and nourish hate that can easily bring about the catastrophe one wants to evade. The Jewish psychology that is reigning here in the highest circles makes the fear express itself in insolence and defiance. They believe that if they are only insolent and audacious enough they will be able to scare the adversary and make him believe that they are real bouncers. This and the lack of sensitiveness to the value of the words, which has been created and enhanced by the incessant jargon, explain the coarse and insolent wording of their official notes. Remembering that such official notes in the last instance must be approved of by the Politbureau, where the fast-coloured Communists nominate the chiefs, one understands that the notes which are signed by Litvinov do not conform with the ordinary usages of the international society. The famous painting by Repin : &quot; The Saporog Cossacks writing an insolent letter to the Sultan &quot; could be put as vignette on the official correspondence. It is just this situation of uncertainty and fear which makes it so difficult to judge how things will develop, and it is therefore not possible to hazard a prophecy on that subject.An incident can bring about Gehenna. In the party there is discord, but how strong the opposition is or its programme nobody knows hardlj&apos; the opposition itself. The economical situation is precarious. There is therefore reason for our business men not to devour the offers to take over the English orders with too voracious an appetite or at least to be careful with the credits.404G [16415J
Extract from a Despatch from M. von Heidenstam, Swedish Minister at Moscow, to the 71 on. E. G. Pettersson, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs at Stockholm, dated Moscow, June 28, 1927. -(Private.)If we now ask ourselves what the consequences of this policy of bloodshed will be, it seems to me not only probable but certain that with regard to the Soviet Union the people will yield and with humble resignation submit to everything. The Tartaric strain, the feeling of the small value of human life, the indifference to the suffering of others and the absence of all sense of justice is the inheritance of the Russian people, and the moral and ethical development during the last ten years has certainly not contributed towards a strengthening of their characters or an enhancement of altruism. They will all sit in their corners trying to evade the attraction of the authorities. Even if hatred is glowing in their minds, there will probably be no expressions of hatred from the masses, though possibly occasional outbursts. The ability to organise and men to make a resistance are lacking.What the consequences outside Russia will be for the Soviet Union depends, as far as I can see, on the reaction of Europe and the United States against the develop-meut of the events. If the public opinion outside Russia docs not react, but accepts everything as a sensational novelty, that soon loses its attraction as a novelty in comparison with Atlantic flights, football matches, scandals from Hollywood and crimes passionnels, then the Politbureau will reach its aims. But if the civilised world with one voice clamours for the salvation of those arrested in masses, if the press of the whole world in a controlled but insistent way and on a foundation of facts takes up the fight and publishes protests full of resentment, thus creating a feeling of indignation, they will give way. They will understand that it does not do to claim equality in political and commercial relations and at the same time at home violate the simplest principles of humanity and right in the most revolting way. And not only the Great Powers can bring pressure to bear upon this, but scientists, authors, artists and politicians from all parts of the world, not least from the smaller States, can make an important contribution. The Komintern has itself shown the way through its world-wide endeavour to save Rakosi, Sacco aud Vanzetti. If a world-wide action were brought about in order to save the arrested in S S.S.R., the Soviet Government would certainly draw in their horns.The development here has been in the form of a slow evolution to normal conditions, with frequent relapses. It is of importance that, the present relapse, perhaps the most serious in the history of the revolution, will not be decisive as to the future bent of the developments. And to this effect the public opinion of the whole world can actively contribute, because, when it comes to realities, the Soviet Government, in spite of all the nice phi-ases, is pretty sensitive to the voices from the West. It is practically certain that the terror will continue and that G..P.U. does everything to persuade the leading men in the Politbureau and the Government that it is necessary that the full powers of the G.P.U. be maintained and that the surety of the State requires that G.P.U. also in the future have their hands free. The more considerate elements should therefore be encouraged in their fight in order to show that the terror will involve serious consequences to foreign countries and that these will not allow themselves to be scared to silence by the terror.
