y-&apos;ItHIS DOCUMECT  IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOvTiiNMSNT ) .EGRET.&apos; lc.F. 249 (27),COPY NOCABINET.CONTRIBUTION OF IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT TOWARDS TRANSPORT OF BRITISH TROOPS BETWEEN ENGLANDAND INDIA.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor,AWARD .:   30At their meeting on the 16th December, 1926, (Cabinet 66 (26) Conclusion 4 (b)) the Cabinet discussed a joint memorandum as to the control and maintenance of Aden which had been submitted by the Secretaries of State for the Colonies, War, and India (CP. 414 (26)) and agreed that as from the 1st April,  1927, a larger share of the cost of Aden should be borne by the Home Government.      Paragraph 15 of the memorandum was in the following termsnThe War Office attach as a condition to these increases in Imperial charges that from the date (1st April, 1927) on which they come Into force, the payment to India of the subsidy of  130&apos;,000 for sea transport out of Army Funds, which, like the present flnanoial arrangement as regards Aden, had Its origin in the recommend-atlons of the Welby Commission, should be dls-   . &apos;  . continued.     The India Office demur to this condition.wIt waa agreed that the claim of the War Office set outin this paragraph should be referred to me for arbitration.. The recommendation of the Welby Commission (1895-1900) on which the subsidy of  130,000 was baaed arose out of a claim by the India Office that the capitation rate charged by the War Office to the Indian Government as representing the home charges in respect
of recruits sent to India, namely,  7.10s a year per man of the British forces in India, should be reduced, the claim being based chiefly on the contention that the introduction of the short-service system had put India to the expense of bringing out a larger number of recruits than would otherwise have been nocossary.     The V&apos;elby Commission was of opinion that the capitation rate should remain unaltered, but added the following recommendatIon (paragraph 335 ): -&quot;Attention must, however, be paid to the allegation that tha term of service in India is less than what a consideration of the interests cf India   would prescribe, and that soldiers are sent home a year too soon in order to meet the exigencies of the conditions of recruiting in England.   - This would indirectly affect the rate of the capitation grant, which we have recommended, should not at present be disturbed.     Y?e have, however, pointed out that short-service will eventually relieve9 not increase, the charge on the Indian taxpayer: but that result Is not yet attained.      In the meantime we recommend, as a measure justifiable in the circumstances, that half the cost of the transport of troops to and from India should he defrayed by the Imperial GovernmentaaThe Report included the following table shewing the estimated financial effect of the short-service system, (paragraph 368):-Increase of expenditureSaving of expenditure,Increase of pay, formerly deferredEventual saving on pens ion list., . . ,&apos;:&apos;&apos;pay 810,000 S. 43&apos;., 000Increased charge of transport...Increased charge of recruiting, over that of the 10-year system, say...  150,000    or200,00073,000 433,000    or   483,000Total 643,000
In the summary cf the Report (paragraph 353) the proposal took the form of a recommendation that &quot;pending tho revision of the capitation rate&quot; the United Kingdom should undertake half the coat of the transport of troops to snd from Hi die,.     D/he contribution so to be made was fiiced at  3.50,000 per annum, and that sum has since been paid.ilho contention of the War Office is that the subsidy was recommended temporarily for a specific reason namely, because the eventua3. relief to the Indian tax-payer result.ring from the smaller charge for pensions under tho short-service system had not at tho time beon attained and would not be for some years;    and thai, as the pension list In 1926 consisted predominantly of men enlisted under tho short-service system, the subsidy under the terms on which it was granted ceases to be payabio aAfter considering this contention and the statements and documents put at my d.Ioposal by the two departments concerned I have cone to tha following con clue i ens; -I read the *;or&amp;s &quot;in the meantime&quot; contained In paragraph 335 of the Welby Report as meaning &quot;until-short-servioe shall have reduced or not increased tho charges on the Indian taxpayer13&apos;;    and on a consideration of the figures submitted to rac by the two departments I am not satisfied that this result has yet been reached. She charges classed in the above table under the heading &quot;Increase of Expenditure&quot; have grown;    and, while the saving on the pensions list^due to short-service is considerable, it still falls short by about  160,000 of the amount estimated by the Commission.      If so, it
follows that the condition on which, according to my-view of the meaning of tho Welby Report, tho subsidy was to ceaso, has not yet been fulfilled.If instead of tho words which are found in paragraph 335 (&quot;in the meantime&quot;) the language of; if: &apos;i&apos;i ; &apos;ii . &apos;  . ;   &apos; &apos; i:  &apos;&quot; &apos;   :        i      : i !; -   i &apos;   - :l i::iii   Hi        &apos; j   i&apos;  : &apos; .... -!&apos;::!       : :paragraph 363 (&quot;pending the revision of the capitation rate&quot;) is to be taken as a guide, the result is the sane.      In the year 1907 a Committee, over which Sir Robert Borner presided, was appointed to consider tho apportionment of charges for the maintenance of theBritish Army in India between tho Hone and Indian-: i        &apos; ii       i   i -&apos; &apos;  :   &apos;        ,    i :   : :&apos;v   &apos;i. : : &apos;      .Governments, more particularly with regard to the capitation rate;    and, as a result of the discussions before that Committee, the Secretaries of State for War and India (Sir R. Ealdane and Mr.  John Morley) on the 1st May 1908 agreed to settle all claims which had been brought before the Committee on the following basis, namely, &quot;that India should (as from the 1st May 1908) pay to the War Office a sum of  300,000 per annum in addition to tho sums due to capitation rate at present in force, all other payments by the India Office to the War Office or the &quot;War Office to the India Office remaining as now, including tho arrangements as to transport&quot;.      The effect of the final words of this agreement  (&quot;including tho arrangements as to transportT&apos;) was to continue the subsidy now in question;    and if that subsidy is to be discontinued, it would seem that the India Office should he at liberty to reopen the wholo agreement.My conclusion,, therefore...is that a case has&apos;. 1    ii .:.     in.; - &apos; &apos;  &apos;&apos;&apos;       iii i inot been made for the immediate discontinuance of the subsidy of  130,000 per annum.      But I should add that it.    .&apos;: &apos; . ^ &apos;       . : &apos; &apos;  : i &apos; : &apos; !&apos;    &quot; i&quot; 4 1111- \ifti!. ,   .. 1 .       - f. ;. . i1 in - \M &quot;i ;.&apos; i   i    .1 i. 1       . . ii&apos;   i        &quot;   1    .&apos;i i -:i
is admitted by the India Office that, owing to imp rovers en ts in pension rates and conditions introduced in and sines 1913, the annual saving on pension rates may shortly bs greatly increased;    and this heing so, I think that, the quo at ion of the continuance of the subsidy should be further considered in fiv9 years1 time.fSgd.)    06.VE.
