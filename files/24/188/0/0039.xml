Printed for the Cabinet, October, 1927.SECRET.Copt No. 3 QCP. 240 (27).THE CABINET.APPOINTMENT OF A CANADIAN MILITARY ATTACHEAT WASHINGTON.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. In October, 1926, the question of the appointment of a Canadian Assistant     091 Military Attache to Washington was discussed between the War Office, the Dominions     2839 Office and the Foreign Office, as it was considered possible that the question might be raised by Canada at the Imperial Conference.As a result of these discussions, and of a reference by the Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, it was agreed that there would be no objection to having a Canadian officer as Assistant Military Attache attached to the British Embassy at that place provided he worked under the British Military Attache. The question, however, was not raised at the Imperial Conference in 1926 and was dropped.2. Last July, however, the question came up again, but in a different form. A Canadian Minister has been appointed to Washington and there is a United States Minister at Ottawa. The Canadian Minister at Washington, Mr. Vincent Massey. is believed to be desirous of having attached to his Embassy a Military Attache of his own. I am not quite certain what his motive is, but such an appointment would lead naturally to a request by the United States of America for the appointment of a United States Attache at Ottawa. One obvious objection to this arrangement would be that it would open the door to the American Military Attache at Ottawa endeavouring &quot; to obtain information, through the Canadian General Staff, which has been refused to the American Military Attache in London. But in any case, it would be clearly objectionable to maintain in a foreign capital two separate Military Attaches representing different armies of the British Empire. It must also be borne in mind that the acceptance of a separate Canadian military attache at Washington might quite conceivably lead to an exchange of Military Attaches between that place and Dublin.3. It appears from reports recently received from America that Mr. Massey is seriously thinking of making this suggestion ; and, if he makes it, there is little doubt but that the Canadian Government will support it on political grounds. On the other hand, it is known that the Canadian General Staff are very much opposed to Mr. Massey&apos;s proposal, and that they prefer the present arrangement under which all Canadian military business is transacted through the British Military Attache.Seeing that, if Mr. Massey makes this proposal, it will in all probability be adopted, possibly without even reference to the Foreign Office in London, I suggest that it might be advisable to forestall him by reverting to the original suggestion, namely, the appoint-ment of a Canadian officer to succeed the present British Assistant Military Attache in Washington when the appointment is due for replacement. I think it would be worth while paying for the Attache&quot; from Imperial funds.4. I should like an early decision in the sense I suggest, in order to anticipate Mr.- Massey&apos;s possible proposals by making a definite suggestion of our own to the Canadian Government.L. W.-E.11th October, 1927.(b27/17)   100   10)27   w.o.p.   8294
