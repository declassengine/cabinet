(THIS DOCJDkgNT IS THE PRCPEkTY OF HIS&apos; BRITaNNIO i/iaJESTYrS GOVERN, .ENT). S  C R B T. CP.  211 (27).CABINET. THE REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF NaVAL ARMAiiENTS. Note on the present position of the Geneva Conferencec1.     By request of the Prime minister a meeting washeld this afternoon (Thursday, July 21st), toconsider the present position of the Geneva Conferenceand the best course to be pursued.      The following were presentThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,(In the Chair). The Lord President of the Council, The Lord Privy Seal, The Chancellor of the Exchequer, The First Lord of the Admiralty The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, The First Sea Lord,Sir Maurice Hankey (Secretary).2.      It is necessary to have clearly in mind the circumstances in which the British Delegates were asked to return for purposes of consultation.     After the Conference had failed, through its normal machinery, to reach agreement on the question of cruisers,  (which was partly due to the difficult personality of one of the Foreign Admirals), certain junior members of the Naval Staffs of the three nations were placed informally in contact to see if they could find some basis of agreement.    They pnndUEed a scheme, which was felt by the Senior Delegates to be worthy
of careful examination.    That&apos;&apos; scheme was transmitted to London in Geneva Telegram No. 194 L, N. of July 17thj and is attached hereto fcr convenience of reference.3. When this scheme was examined in theAdmiralty it was found to be open to objection.Lord Beatty reeled to the Prime Minister and soiteof his colleagues that -(i)     It gave the United States by Treaty the right to parity in all olasses of&quot; ships /&quot;which was contrary to the policy of the Cabinet as set out in earlier telegrams to Geneva (e. g. , No.. 125 of July &quot;15 tht(ii) Japan was given the right by Treaty to a ratio of 5 : 3j in Cruisers and Destroyers, which was considerably higher than the Admiralty could assent to, the present ratio in Cruisers being 2*1 vis-a-vis^ Japan.Lord Beatty was anxious to have Admiral Field home for consultation, and the Cabinet Committee thoughtit advisable, in order- to remove any possiblemisunderstanding, that their colleagues should alsoreturn, in order to explain the exact positionreached at Geneva, the alternatives open to us and what their effect,, both political and naval, wouldbe.4. An adjournment of the Conference was accord-ingly arranged, and Mr Bridgeman, Lord Cecil and Captain Egar-ton, the Director of Plans in the ISaval Staff (in place of Admiral B^eld, who was indisposed) returned to London.5. Y/hen the Cabinet Committee met this afternoon Lord Beatty reported that he had not modified his objections to the scheme now under consideration at Geneva. He had been informed that the British Naval Officers who were ooncerned in drawing it up had put it forward as the best plan they oould arrive
at as a basis for discussion, but without expressing their approval to it.    On the other hand, the British Delegates stated that Admiral Field has recommended the scheme.    Lord Beatty added to his previous objections that this scheme, if adopted now, would undoubtedly be used as a precedent when the question came to be re-considered before the expiration of the Treaty in 1936, and that, by adopting it, now, we should be adopting for an indefinite time the principle of parity with the United States in the numbers and tonnage of the smaller Cruisers, which in fact, owing to our peculiar conditions, spells inferiority, as well as accepting a ratio for Japan which exceeded that which the Admiralty had from the first declared to be the limit of safety.6. After an exhaustive discussion of the whole situation with their colleagues who are Delegates to the Geneva Conference, the Cabinet Committee are agreed in rejecting the idea of breaking up the Conference forthwith. That would be a counsel of despair, the possible evil consequences of which are too obvious to need recapitula-tion.    Agreement must be reached if agreement is possible consistently with security and economy.    Two alternatives appear open to us, which the Cabinet Committee submit for consideration by the Cabinet.7. THE FIRST ALTERATIVE is that our Delegates should return to Geneva and announce that the scheme now under consideration, as set forth in the Appendix (commonly known as the Japanese proposal), is not acceptable to His Majesty5 s Government in Great Britain, and that we cannot pursue it any further.    They should then make a comprehensive statement of our policy covering the whole field of naval reduction and limitation of ax^maiuents, and submit it as the basis of the
future discussions at the Conference.   this statement would have to &quot;be drawn up with theutmost oare j. and it is impossible, in the short time at our disposal, to do raoro than set out themain headsj which are as follows:-Cl) At the outset of the statement it would .be explained that our plan is drawn up in accord with the principles of the Washington Treaty of 1922, as well as with what we believe to have been the objects which President Coolidge had in mind in srgunonlng the Geneva Conference,  hose objects are, economy combined with national security   two essential oonditions which would be emphasized at every point in the statement.(2) It would be recalled that the Washington Conference had secured economy and national security mainly by a soheme of limitation applied to Capital Ships, these being the naval units in regard to which the maximum economy oould be achieved.   Our proposals for extending the provisions of the Washington Confer-enoe in regard to Capital Ships would then be announced, and it would be emphasized that eoonomy would be promoted thereby while leaving national security intact.(3) Next we would announce our willingness to promote economy by extending to the large fighting Cruisers which accompany the Fleet the principle of a ratio, thus extending to these vessels the principles adopted at Washington in regard to Capital Ships.   As these ships home second only to Capital Ships in their cost, economy would be promoted and no sacrifice of national security would be involved.(4) The statement would then point out the marked distinction between the large fighting Cruisers which accompany the Fleet and the smaller Cruisers used to polioe and patrol the trade routes, and insistence would be laid on their being dealt with in two separate classes. It would be explained that a general and undifferentiated limitation of Cruiser tonnage would (so far as Great Britain is concerned) oause a great increase of expenditure, and if made (by Treaty) a permanent part of the international system of the world, Involve a dangerous- diminution of national security.&apos; &apos;* That system would promote (for Great Britain) neither eoonoiqy nor ra-tional security.
(o) As regards the smaller Cruisers required for police and patrol work, the statement should mention the difficulty of calculating pre-cisely the numbers required, but it should be made clear that we intended to build as few as possible consistently with security.    It should be stated that if the United States of America choose to build small Cruisers up to numerical parity with Great Britain we shall not quarrel with them, hut v/e should not conceal that this appeared to us difficult to reconcile with the objects of the Conference and the declared principles on which it has been called together. Fighting ships, which accompany the Fleet, can be dealt with as the Capital. Ships have already been, by a simple mathematical formula, but when calculations have to be nade as to other classes a variety of circumstances have to be taken into consideration, such as (in the case of the British Empire) the length of the trade routes, the extent of our commerce, the geographical situation of Great Britain in relation to Europe, its dependence on sea ooimaunications . for food and the means of existence, the position of the Dominions, etc.    No such simple mathematical formula is possible in the case of these vessels, since equal numbers with unequal needs do not give equal security.    Consequently we could not assent to any Treaty which implied that numerical tonnage meant, as between Great Britain and the United States of America, anything that deserved to be called equality of sea-pcwer.(6) The statement would conclude with the following definite proposals (which were suggested to the Cabinet Committee by the Chief of the Naval Staff at a recent meeting under the title Scheme &quot;B&quot;) as a basis for the future work of the Geneva Conference
SOHS:::S 5.1.     That the Conference should ratify what has already &quot;been agreed to by the Technical Committee, viz.(1) That Destroyer Leaders and Destroyers should be limited in size and armament:-viz. to 1850 and 1500 tons respectively with 5 inch guns.(2) That the age limit for Destroyers should be 16 years.(3) That the proportion of Destroyer Leaders to Destroyers should be fixed.(4) That the maximum size and armament of submarines should be 1750 tons with 5 inch guns.(5) That the age limit of Submarines should be 13 years.2.        That as no true basis has been discovered on which the numbers of small cruisers required by each Power can be composed that this question should be left to a future Conference.That as the proposals which have been considered in re-lalion to the total numbers of or total tonnage for these cruisers would not, however, have resulted either in reduction of Armaments or relief of Taxation, the failure to reach agree-ment is consequently less regrettable.g.        That similarly the question of total tonnage for destroyers and submarines should be left to a future Conference should a basis satisfactory to all parties not be found. 4.       That the Conference should also reach agreement on the following points each of which would result in great economy.(a) Division of Cruisers into 2 Classes, viz.10,000 ton Cruisers and small Cruisers.(b) The number of 10,000 ton Cruisers to be retained to be 12. 12. 8. and their age to be extendedto 20 years.
(c) Small cruisers to be limited to 6,0o0 tons and 6&quot; guns.(d) To further limit the size and armament of capital ships and aircraft carriers and to extend their age oIf the United States Delegation (notwithsxanding the emphasis laid in this Scheme on its continuity with the Washington Conference and its close adherence to the principles on &quot;which President Coolidge had summoned the Geneva Conference) should reject it, the Conference would be allowed to breal-down.
8. TETB SS00M3 ATiTORN&amp;TIVB is that the British Delegates should return to Geneva and he gin &quot;by a statement on the same lines as that adumbrated in the first alternative.    When that plan was rejected by the United States Delegation (as it almost certainly would be) they should announce that, sooner than allow the Conference to break down, they would be prepared, as a working expedist for the next nine years, to state that we intended to build (x) Cruisers of the smaller t,ype before 1936;   that if the United States choose to build an equal number (and Japan an agreed number (y)) we should not object.    Our Delegates would make unmist akeably clear that this offer is made without admitting any principle that can be quoted as a precedent in any renewal of the Treaty, and that after 1936 we reserve the right to approach the question with complete freedom. The Conference could then take up its work on the basis of the plan now under consideration and set forth in the Appendix, i.e. , &quot;the Japanese plan&quot;9. Should either of these alternatives commend itself to the Cabinet, the next step will be to formulate the statements to be made by the British Delegates on their return to Geneva.*      a      *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, July 21, 1927.
APR-KDIX.Prom Switzerland.Decypher.     H.Mrs Consul (Geneva)16th July, 1927.D.    12,25 a.m. 17th July, 1927.R.    9.00 a.m. 17th July, 1927.No. 194 L.N.Important.Following from First Lord for Prime Minister.My immediately preceding telegram.Following are lines on which it is hoped agreement may be reached as a result of discussions between British and Japanese delegations on cruisers and destroyers.Begins.British and Japanes delega-tions have discussed question of surface vessels and though Japanese delegation would have preferred to adhere to figure of 315,000 tons, they are ready in order to meet British view to transfer from 70,085 submarine tonnage for which they have asked 10,000 tons to tonnage of surface vessels.     British delegation are in the same spirit and subject to following conditions ready to reduce their surface vessel tonnage from 550,000 to 500,000 tons;     The two delegations could therefore agree to a total tonnage of surface auxiliary combatant vessels.(1) For British Empire 500,000, for Japan 325,000. (2) Retention .of an additional 25$ of total tonnage in old vessels.
(3)   10,000 ton cruisers to be limited in numberj for British Empire and United States each 12, for Japan 8.(4)   Retention of under-mentioned vessels; for British Empire &quot;York&quot; four cruisers of &quot;Hawkins&quot; class. For United States 10 cruisers of &quot;Omaha&quot; class.     For Japan 4 cruisers of &quot;Furutaka&quot; class.(5) Other cruisers.     Japan having no intention of laying down any other 8&quot; gun cruisers before December 31st, 1936, will not object to a clause that no other cruisers shall be constriicted in excess of 6,000 tons disolacement and to mount a gun exceeding 6&quot; before Decemt-r 31st, 1936.(3) That within total tonnage figure for cruisers and destroyers there shall be a definite agreed percentage allocated to cruisers and destroyers respectively.Ends.
