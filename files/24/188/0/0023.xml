208Printed /or the Cabinet, August, 1927.SECRET.CP. 224 (27)THE CABINET.REDUCTION  OF  ARMIES   OF  OCCUPATION.MEMORANDUM BY THE WAR OFFICE, PREPARED BY THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I. Proposkd Reductions.The composition of the Allied Forces on the Rhine is regulated by an Inter Allied 0154 Agreement and the present basic numbers are  6819France      ...       ...       ...      ...      ...      *&quot;     60,000Great Britain       ...      ...      ...      ...       ...      7,900Belgium    ...       ...      ...      ...      ...       ...      8,900Total        ............     76,800The actual strengths are below these maxima, as follows France      ...       ...      ...      ...      ...       ... 54,900Great Britain       ...      ...       ...      ...       ... 7,300Belgium 6,300Total        ...      ...      ...       ... 68,500At earlier stages in the present negotiations for a reduction of the Allied Forces, it was proposed that France should reduce by 10,000 and Great Britain and Belgium by 1,500 each on the basic numbers at present in force.In reply to these proposals, the French Government in a Note dated 10th August, 1927, stated that they were not prepared to contemplate a total Allied Force of less than 60,000 effectives on the Rhine and that they considered that of these not less than 50,000 should be French Troops leaving a total ot 10,000 for Great Britain and Belgium. They suggested that, in determining how any agreed reductions should be allocated between the Armies of the three Allied nations, all financial considerations should be put aside.Following upon this reply from the French Government, the Treasury and Foreign Office have formulated revised proposals designed to achieve the reduction of the total to 60,000 which the French have conceded while at the same time meeting the French condition regarding the number of French effectives. On this basis, working on present strengths, and not upon the basic numbers referred to above (upon which is based the present allocation of Germany&apos;s payment out of the Dawes Annuities on account of the costs of the Armies of Occupation), the Foreign Office propose to negotiate for reductions as follows : France to reduce to (?.e., by 4,900)        ...      ...    50,000Great Britain to reduce by 2,000 to       ...      ...      5,300Belgium to reduce by 2,000 to    ...      ...      ...     4,300They propose to attach certain financial conditions (dealt with below). &apos;. iThis proposal puts an undue share of the reduction upon Great Britain and Belgium. On the basis of, present strengths, if France reduces her force to 50,000, i.e., by 4,900, proportionate reductions by Great Britain and Belgium would be 660 and 570 respectively.(B27/1T)   100   8/26   W.O.P.   3234.
But this would only achieve a total reduction of 6,130 whereas a total of 8,500 is required in order to bring the total of the Allied Forces down to 60,U00. A division of this&apos; 8,500 between the Allies in proportion to present strengths would give : France to reduce by ...       ...       ...       ...    6,800 to 48,100Great Britain to reduce by ...       ...       ...       ...      &amp;u0      6,400Belgium to reduce by       ...       ...       ...       ...      800      5,500Total reduction of     .........    8,500 to 60,000This basis, which the War Office consider should be adopted, could be met, so far as the British force is concerned, by withdrawal of one battalion and certain ancillaries. It involves a larger reduction on the part of the French than the French Government has already offered ; but not more than is reasonable in the circumstances&apos;.The War Office are concerned in the first place with the military aspect of the suggested reduction of the British Army of Occupation. In the second place, in so far as the British share of Germany&apos;^ payments on account of the cost of the Armies of Occupation is taken as an Appropriation in Aid of Army Votes, the War Office are also concerned with the effect of these proposals on the amount by which this shave will be reduced.II. Military Aspect.From the point of view of reductions generally, the General Staff consider that so long as British troops form part of the occupying forces on the Rhine, the British Army of Occupation should be sufficiently strong to form a self contained force capable of acting effectively as a unit. and of fulfilling adequately the duty of defending the area allotted to it. x^From the point of view of internal security the British Army of the Rhine requires 3 infantry battalions to ensure the safety of its own barracks and quarters at Wiesbaden, and 1 battalion&apos; is also necessary at Bingen to secure the Kempten Bridge over the Rhine. It is obvious that some reserve over and above these requirements must be kept in case of unrest in the industrial centres or of other emergencies.The proposed reduction by 2,000 men would entail the withdrawal of 2 infantry battalions and certain personnel of ancillary services. If these troops were withdrawn, there would remain as reserve-3 batteries of artillery. 1 infantry battalion. 1 cavalry regiment. 1 section, armoured cars.Tvhichj in the opinion of the General Staff, would be insufficient; to meet the emer-gencies which it is necessary and reasonable to contemplate. Moreover, any such reduction would make it impossible for the British Force to carry out efficiently the duties which have been allotted to it by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chiet&apos;, Allied Armies of Occupation, and would seriously affect the general efficiency of the force by preventing adequate training.A reduction of 900,- in the form of 1 Infantry battalion plus ancillaries, would reduce the efficiency of the British Contingent to carry out the military role allotted to it.by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Allied Armies of Occupation, but would still permit of adequate internal security measures and would have a less detrimental effect on training and prestige.III. Financial Aspect.Receipts from Germany in respect of the Armies of Occupation have been divided as follows under an inter-allieaagreembnt dated 13tK January,! 1927 :-p-(^rMaVkB.1-Fra&apos;h&apos;discussion.For^^abasib strbhgtH of 60;000       .vr 100&apos;mfflibn.-    -.vTPri--  :/ -BritalhV-&apos; For a Ha^sHirehgt^Of 7,900&apos;       .v; v t&amp;timW) &apos;   -IBelgium. For a basic strength of 8,900 . 16   . ,(Y i(
The amounts are subject to proportionate reduction if the strengths fall below the above basic figures, but the agreement permits an alternative basis (which takes into account variations of French cost of living) which the French Government have reserved the right to use and which would enable France to reduce her numbers without reducing her i*eceipts.The Treasury propose to attach as a condition of making any reduction of the British Force either : (a) That the French should abandon their alternative basis and that Army ofOccupation receipts should be reduced pro rata in relation to reduced strengths.Or(b) That the British share should remain fixed at 25 million gold marks irrespective of strength but subject to a maximum of the full cost of the British Force not being exceeded.With the reductions proposed by the Foreign Office the strength of the British Force would fall to 5,300, i.e., 2,000 below present strengths but 2,600 below the basic strengths on which the present payments are fixed.   The financial effect of this would be: Under (a) above.  Army Funds would lose receipts amounting to  -112,000*, but the Treasury would receive more than this sum in additional Reparations pay-ments : in other words the British Exchequer would gain slightly while the War Office would receive less than the cost of the Force. But if this course is adopted it would be reasonable for the War Office to claim re-imbui-sement of their loss from the Treasury and the War Office must press that this claim should be admitted.Under (b) above. Owing to the condition that the receipts should not exceed the maximum cost of the Force (which for 5,300 effectives would be about  1,000,000) Army Funds would be faced with a probable loss of some  250,000, against which the Treasury would not receive an equivalent in extra Reparations receipts.   The British Exchetfjgjer would lose on this basis.For the reduction of 900 proposed by the War Office above the effect would be : Under (a) above. Army Funds would lose receipts amounting to  237,000 while the Treasury would receive something more than this sum in additional Reparations payments, from which the loss to Army Funds could be made up.Under (b) above. No loss would occur as the cost of the force remaining, viz., 6,400 is estimated to be slightly in excess of  1,250,000 (25 million gold marks).* This is exclusive of a special amount of  250,000 transferred to Army Funds from Reparations receipts in 1927, the loss of which will have to be faced in 1928, making a total increase on Army-Estimates on account of the Army of Occupation of  662,000.The War Office,22nd August, 1927.
