They admit the grievance of the House of lords, and in effect 1 suggest no remedy.      Only one remedy was considered, namely, thu carrying-over of Bills to a second Session, but is that the only possible thing that can be done?What is the grievance?     It is not that the House of lords is deprived of its power to reject a Bill;    there is always time to do that.    The real grievance is, particularly when a Conservative Government is in office,  that the majority of the House of lords are practically precluded from making any effective suggestions for the amendment of a Bill und&apos;er conditions in which there is any ohance that they will be fairly considered.    It is not a question of the House of lords insisting on their amendments - in existing conditions they are very unlikely to desire to do that - but, particularly in certain questions, they are experts whose suggestions ought to be treated with respect, not only out of regard for the House of lords, but also in the interests of good legLslation.Is there then no method by which the House of lords will be enabled to make suggestions as to legislation in plenty of time for the House of Commons to be able to consider them before the end of the Session?     T venture to suggest a possible1see Cabinet 39(27) Conclusion 5.COPY NO.^
plan.   Whey should not important Government measures he introduced into the House of lords concurrently with their introduction into the House of Commons?     The house of lords would then he able to consider them as they went along in the House of Commons and make proposals upon them which the House of Commons would or might consider.     When the Commons Bill came up to the Xords these stiggestions could he, if necessax-y without debate, embodied in the Bill and sent down immediately to the Commons and that would ensure some consideration- even if it had not already been gjven in the earlier procedure.let me make my suggestion precise by an imaginary illustration.     An Agricultural land Bill is introduced into the House of Commons and read a second time there on the 1st May, the Committee stage being fixed for a y/eek later, the 8th May.    In the meantime, on the 2nd and 3rd May the House of Lords has&apos;the same Bill introduced and read a second time,  the Committee stage on the lord Bill being postponed until after the Committee stage of the House of Commons Bill has been concluded.    If that is con-cluded on, say, the 22nd May, the House of lords on the 23rd would go Into Committee on its own Bill.     The Govern-ment would no doubt move to amend it in accordance with what had taken place in the House of Commons.   Meanwhile, the members of the House of lords would be at liberty to move any further or other amendments as they pleased. Similar procedure would be adopted with regard to the Report stage.     Owing to pressure of business in the Commons, let us assume that the Bill is not read a third time there until the 20th July, the Session being planned2c
Geneva,7th July, 1927.3.tc come to an end on the 1st August.    The House of Lords would not read their Bill a third time at all, hut the House of Commons Bill would come up to them on the 21st July.     Either it would have been amended In accordance with their suggestions curing Its passage through the Bouse of Commons or It would not, and in the latter case the House of Lords would have the opportunity of inserting immediately the amendments it really thought important, which it would already have had full opportunity to consider, and the Bill would then he considered in the House of Commons in the ordinary way-It is possible that this suggestion will be regarded as so much  outside general Parliamentary procedure as to be impracticable.    All the same, I cannot help feeling that it would give a real value to the deliberations of the House of Lords aid would give them a real opportunityof utilising their special knowledge on such matters as agricultural land or the like.      I venture, therefore, to hope that it might be considered by the Cabinets(Int) R.Co
