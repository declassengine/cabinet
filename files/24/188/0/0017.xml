II POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES. COAL MINING.The increase in unemployment which normally takes place in this industry during the summer months was accentuated in the last quarter by other difficulties. Under-employment was very prevalent in most districts, but some improvement can be looked for in the near future with an increasing home demand for coal.IRON AND STEEL.The improvement in these industries was not maintained during the last quarter. Production began to show signs of slackening off towards the end of March, as the arrears of work accumulated during the dispute period were completed and a slight increase in unemployment occurred towards the end of the quarter. The tin-plate industry suffered a severe set-back, the percentage of unemployment rising from 5*5 to 22&apos;5 per cent, during the period.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.A considerable amount of new tonnage was commenced during the last quarter, and the position of this industry showed an appreciable improvement during April and May. This recovery was not, however, maintained during June, and at the end of that month the percentage of unemployment was still 22*9 per cent. [ENGINEERING.On the whole the engineering position improved throughout the quarter. Employment in general engineering was fairly good, while a substantial improve-ment took place in marine engineering and in constructional engineering. The electrical section continued to be active, and in motor engineering employment was also good, although signs of seasonal slackening were apparent towards the end of the quarter.TEXTILES.Cotton. Comparatively little change occurred in the employment position of the cotton industry. In-the Egyptian spinning section employment remained good, but a considerable amount of short time was worked in the American section. Prospects are still uncertain.&quot;Woollen and Worsted. Some improvement took place in these industries in the beginning of the quarter, but a decline took place, particularly in the heavy woollen section, in June.Other Textiles. With the exception of jute and carpets, a slight improvement has been shown in all other branches of the textile trade.BUILDING. BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.The activity which is normally experienced in this industry during the second quarter of the year was more pronounced than usual during the period under review. In June there was some slackness in the deoorating branch, ohiefly owing to inclement weather, but the improvement in the brick and tile industry was well maintained.
clothing trades.Following the termination of the normal seasonal activity in these trades, employment showed a falling off in June. Unemployment at the end of the month was, however, lower than at the end of last quarter.pottery.The employment position in this industry continued to remain unsatisfactory, unemployment increasing in April and June.transport, dock labour and shipping services.A general improvement took place in all sections, and in particular at the London Docks.
iii. work instituted for relief of unemployment.numbers employed.[see note on page 1 of november 1924 report (op. 541 (24)).]the table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the exchequer or the road fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of liable. the schemes included are those undertaken by local and other authorities and public companies with a financial contribution from the state with the object of relieving unemployment; and works in respect of Avhich guarantees have been given under the trade facilities acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. schemes to which state financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., housing schemes), and works put in hand by local authorities without state assistance are not included. certain other schemes involving government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the export credits scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by government contracting departments.Method of Compilation. the figures for the road and bridge schemes assisted by. the ministry of transport and for schemes assisted by the unemployment grants committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the ministry of transport) obtained from returns received at employment exchanges from local and other authorities and public companies. those relating to schemes assisted under the trade facilities acts are compiled by the trade facilities act advisory committee from returns received from companies to whom guarantees under the acts have been given.Works assisted bj 	Number of -Men employed at 				June 25,1927.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t These figures indicate meu employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.Note. No distinction is now made between the Forestry Commission^ normal and relief work, and grants for afforestation form part of the normal programme. The average number of forest employees engaged on the Commission^ operations (including Crown woods) during the quarter ended June 30, 1927, was 3,023 as compared with 2,6S7 for the corresponding quarter of 1926.
IV.- OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Dominions Office,)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British, settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been.agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison with the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of April, May and June, 1027 (with the corresponding figures for the year 1926), and for the three months ended the 30th June, 1927 and 1926, respectively, are set out in theait        * m   i ifollowing Table :-Quarterly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.(1.)

Expenditure by Poor Law Authorities, A (England and Wales), B (Scotland).These Statistical Tables have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

Unemployment Insurance.(Estimates, Class V, Vote 7.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924, the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, since extended by the Act of 1926 to the 31st December, 1927, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to July 2, 1927.   301,532,000 29,424,0002,906,0001,765,000 739,000 -   336,366,000113,150,000 101,851,000 77,104,000 3,839,000 --   295,944,0005,825,000 5,825,000 3,884,000-     15,534,00023,970,000918,000336,366,000* Note.-The old Fund at November 8th, 1920, had reached a total of  22,210,000.Estimate of Benefit payable from Armistice to March 31, 1928,  336,870,000.Expenditure  -Benefit paidAppropriation for AdministrationSection 9 Unemployment Insurance Act (No. 2), 1924, and Section 25-Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;c.....Interest (Net)Income Contributions  Employers Employed ExchequerExchequer (for ex-Service Men)Balance of Old Fund at Armistice (excluding Interest accrued) *  Employers Employed exchequer loans from Treasury (Net).... .... ....Miscellaneous Deposits in respect of future Contribu-tions, &amp;c.....

land settlement.In England and Wales the provision of small holdings under the Land Settle-ment (Facilities) Act, 1919, and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs and (6) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Settlement through Local Authorities. The net capital cost of these schemes up to the 31st March, 1926, when the Land Settlement Scheme came to an end, is estimated to be  15,250,000, of which approximately  14,050,000 (net) was loaned by the Public Works Loan Board. Interest in respect of such loans is payable by Councils. Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, the Exchequer bears the loss incurred up to the 31st March, 1926, on the Councils&apos; Small  holdings  account (e.g., due to charging a fair as opposed to an economic rent), so far as such loss had been reasonably and necessarily incurred.As from the 1st April, 1926, the Exechequer assistance takes the form of annual contributions to meet the difference between the loan charges and the estimated net income from the Councils&apos; estates. These contributions did not commence until the year 1927 and their total capitalized value cannot at present be estimated.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders is being borne by the Exchequer. Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not involve an appreciable cash call upon the Exchequer, as additional capital expenditure is met from the surplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property. - -   &apos;land settlement.(A.) england and wales.

Juveniles.After the Armistice, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in certain localities to deal with the problem of unemployed juveniles. After a period of closure centres were again established, and the cost, which was originally shared by the Board of Education and Local Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the 31st March, 1924, partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to 75 per cent, in respect of approved schemes, the Local Authority providing the remaining 25 per cent. From the 1st April, 1924, the Exchequer Grant was, as an emergency measure, for so long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains acute, raised to 100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local Education Authorities.From the 1st April, 1926, the Exchequer Grant was revised as follows : (1.) To Axithorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles exceeded 6 per cent, during the twelve months which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.A per capita grant fixed by the Minister for each Authority separately equal to the approved average weekly cost to the Authority of each Juvenile in average attendance, taking into account recurrent expenditure only, during the twelve months which ended on the 30th June, 30th September, or 31st December, 1925, whichever was the latest period for which consecutive claims had been received. If complete figures for one year ending on one of the above dates were not available, or if the Authority had not previously opened Centres, the per capita grant was fixed by the Minister on such information, including the Authority&apos;s proposals for 1926, as was available to him.(2.) To Atithorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles was not less than 3 per cent, and not more than 6 per cent, during the twelve months which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.Either (i) a per capita grant calculated as in (1) above, but equal to three-quarters only of the approved average weekly cost, or (ii) a grant of 75 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by the Authority during the financial year 1926, as the Authority chose.schemes for training women and juveniles and young unemployed fit men.(Estimates, Class V, Vote 8.)(a.) Women.The following table aggregates: (i) the expenditure incurred wholly by the Ministry of Labour in connection with the Registered Unemployed Women&apos;s Scheme which operated from 1919 to 1921; (ii) the expenditure on schemes for training women in Domestic Service, &amp;c, under the auspices of the Central Committee for Women&apos;s Training. Up to the 31st July, 1924, the cost of this scheme was met partly from Exchequer Grants and party from other sources, but, as from the 1st August, 1924, the whole cost has been borne by the Exchequer.
(3.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles was less than 3 per cent, during the year which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.Normally no grant is payable, but if in the case of a County Council the Authority can show that there are clearly defined districts where the average percentage of insured juveniles unemployed during the year was definitely abnormal, the Minister is prepared in approved cases to sanction grant as in (2) above in respect of expenditure on Centres serving these districts.In the case of approved Centres established by Authorities who are Authorities for elementary education, only grant is paid under (1) or (2) above, according to the percentage of unemployment among insured juveniles in the area of the Authority for elementary education only, provided that the proposal of the Authority has received the concurrence of the County Authority concerned.From the 1st April, 1927, the Exchequer grant is payable under terms similar to those in force for the financial year 1926, with the exception that, to qualify for grant under paragraph 1, the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles in the area of an Authority must have exceeded 7 per cent, for the calendar year 1926. Further, per capita grants were revised so that the maximum rate of grant is 5s. for boys and 4s. 6d. for girls per week of 15 hours instruction.Estimated Net Expenditure from Armistice to March 31,1927.

Young Unemployed Fit Men.The Ministry of Labour is conducting, as an experimental measure, a scheme of training for the benefit of young unemployed men between the ages of 19 and 25 (up to 29 for ex-service men) of a class who, owing to the prolonged trade depression, have had no opportunity of learning a skilled trade. Two urban and two rural centres have been established.  The length of each course of training is six months.Estimated Expenditure to March 31. 1927.Estimated Total expenditure to March 31, 1928.
