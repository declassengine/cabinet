221S DOCWa7f  IS 0?HE PRO-PERT/ OP HI 3 BRI2AK2IC MaJ^3EYT 3 government A B I IT E 2.T/ASEBSrGJCffl&apos;     HOURS     CONY SENIOR. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,330 E ICT?T22.T06(27).Copy go ^ti1,    On the 4th May the Cabinet authorised me (Cabinet Conclusions 30(27) 3) to consult the Employers1 representa-tives privately in order to ascertain their views upon the way in which we propose to deal with the Hours question;     I undertook then to report further to the Cabinet.     I accordingl sen-!; to Sir David Milne sZatson (President of the Jimployers1 Confederation) a few days later a memorandum embodying our proposals.     ITailst these were under consideration it became known thai; the Hours question would be debated on the Motion for the Adjournment on the 2nd June, and on the previous day the Confederation circulated to Members and to the Press a lengthy printed statement of the case against the ratification of the Washington Convention.      (In this document the Employers dealt, not with my private memorandum, but with the Convention&quot; itself).     I have since had from the Confederation a further communication, in which they again state the grounds for their opposition to ratification,     These doouments are so lengthy, and the matter is so involved, that I do not propose to trouble the Cabinet with copies.2,    It is plain that dislike of the Convention itself has stiffened and that a considerable number of Employers&apos; organisations are in a mood to initiate a compaign against it. &apos;Uhey do not attach so much importance to the Conclusions of the London Conference (which removed many of the difficulties/in
in, tiie Convention itself) as those Conclusions merit or to the possibility   of the two documents being read together; but I do not feel confident that refinements of this kind would be appreciated in the country generally if a campaign were once begun,3,     Che main reasons why the Confederation concentrate upon opposition to the Washington Convention seem to be:-(1)   they fear that although a &quot;sensible&quot; Hours Act might be passed now, the Washington Convention would still be in existence and might be used later on as a reason for modifications in the law;   and(2)   they do not regard the Washington Convention as a suitable basis for an attempt at securing international uniformity of Hours, 4,      I have always foreseen that in the end we might find it necessary to construct a fresh international instrument which would in effect be a new Convention, taking the place of the Washington Convention, i,e, an instrument which, while embodying the principles of Washington, would be free from its embarrassing details,     There are considerable diffioultie in the way of securing a new Convention, and it would have been easier if we could have proceeded by means of oome supplementary Convention, for example, on the lines of the London Agreement, which could have been conjoined to the original Convention,     The opposition of the Employers to the Convention is, however, so pronounced that I am doubtful whether it would be possible to prevent an open oampaign, unless we can indicate that we are prepared to try to work towards a new Convention.
5.     Accordingly, the proposal that I have to put to the Cabinet is that I should see the Zfrployers and tell them that it is the view of&quot; the Cabinet that, having; regard to the history of the maiter since 1919, the Hours question must be dealt with and that the Government invite the Employers to co-operate in the framing of proposals which will be governed by two main considerations:    (l)   that, while embodying the principle of the 48 hour weeh, they should follow in the main the existing industrial conditions in this country and should be calculated to interfere as little as possible with those conditions;    and (S) that the proposals should form a suitable basis for a Convention designed to secure greater international uniformity of hours,6,     If the Cabinet will authorise me to intimate that this is the view of the Government, I am not without hope that the Employers may be disposed to adopt a more helpful and constructive attitude.     If this should prove not to be the case, I would report a^ain to the Cabinet.(intd.) A..S.-M.Ministry of Labour
