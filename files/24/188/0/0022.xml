SECRET. Copy No.  30CP. 223 (27).CABINET.DEFENCE CONTRIBUTIONS BY COLONIAL AND OTHERGOVERNMENTS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE herewith a note by the Air Ministry on the question of defence contributions from Colonial and other Governments in so far as concerns the Royal Air Force.S HJuly 26, 1927.Note by the Air Ministry on Colonial Defence Contributions.1. The contributions which have been obtained from Colonial or other Govern-ments in respect of Air Force units stationed in their territories have up to the present been confined to India, the Middle East and Aden. In the latter two instances the matter is merely one of adj ustment between Imperial votes, and no relief to the Home Exchequer results, except in so far as India contributes towards the cost of the Aden Garrison.No steps have so far been taken to formulate any claim in respect of the Air Force units stationed in Egypt; the matter would naturally come up for consideration in connection with any new proposals put forward by the War Office.The question of a contribution by the Sudan towards the cost of the Air Force unit stationed there has recently been discussed, and it has been accepted in principle that the Sudan Government should meet at any rate the extra cost of maintaining this unit in the Sudan instead of at home.At Singapore the Air Force will be essentially a component in a general scheme of Imperial Defence, and the question of contributions (hitherto solely towards the capital expenditure involved) has been dealt with on this basis.At Hong Kong the question of sharing with the Colony the cost of preparing an aerodrome is under examination. At present there is no project for stationing air forces at Hong Kong otherwise than in connection with the Fleet Air Arm or as an emergency measure.2. In the view of the Air Ministry, the Royal Air Force must necessarily be considered first and foremost as an Imperial Service, and the tying up of its units permanently at specific points in response to local needs and under obligations to local governments should therefore be avoided so far as possible.3. The Air Ministry would accordingly propose to pursue the present policy of considering ad hoc, on each occasion when an Air Force unit is to be stationed in a, colony or dependency, the most favourable arrangement which can be made from the point of view of the Home Exchequer according to the circumstances of the particular case.Air Ministry, July 26,1927.[16462]
