Paper No. 299-C.)(Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 226th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Secretary reminding them that in accordance with the Conclusions reached by the Committee at its 199th Meeting on the 2nd April, 1925, the development of the Naval Base at Singapore was to be reviewed annually in the light of the international situation.LORD BEATTY explained that at the 215th Meeting, a year ago, the Committee agreed that, although preliminary arrangements for establishing docking facilities for our largest ships at Singapore and for developing gradually the necessary oil fuel installations on our Eastern routes should proceed, there was no necessity to make preparations involving additional expenditure for placing at Singapore for a decisive battle in the Pacific a British battle fleet, with cruisers, flotillas, and all ancillary vessels, superior in strength or at least equal to the sea-going navy of Japan. It was also agreed that this decision should be reviewed by the Committee of Imperial Defence every year in the light of the international situation. The question therefore arose whether anything had happened in the international sphere during the last 12 months which would tend to modify this opinion.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said he saw no reason to modify the conclusion reached last year.SIR GEORGE MILNE mentioned that he had recently sent General Sir Webb Gillman to inspect the defences of Singapore and to render a report, and he suggested that when General Gillman returned, which would be shortly, the Committee should reassemble to review the question of Singapore in the light of his report.THE PRIME MINISTER concurred, and said that this could be done after the summer recess.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a.) To report to the Cabinet that, in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on the 6th May, 1925 (Cabinet 24 (25), Conclusion (3) (a) (iii)), the Committee of Imperial Defence have reviewed in the light of the inter-national situation the conclusions in regard to Singapore reached at their , 199th Meeting, held on the 2nd April, 1925, and reaffirmed at the 215th Meeting on the 22nd April, 1926, and are satisfied that the general policy then laid down is still sound and should be adhered to.
