&quot;&quot;234&quot;which I propose to write to Mr, calder, and I should.like to have the approval of my oolleagues before sending it,L.W.E,27th July, i927.Samuel Allsopp &amp; Sons, Limited,Burton.-on-Trent. July 25th 1927,The Rt,Hon,Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Minister of War, . War Office, London, S.W.Dear Sir Laming,Some years ago I was approached at short notice to provide some money for the purchase of Hill 60 which was wanted for a British War Memorial, and a small portion was used for that purpose.The title was in the name of the officer, (Col. Cawston) who approached me and my own name.I have now made arrangements with Col. Cawston whereby I become sole owner of Hill 60 and propose presenting it to the Nation as I feel that suoh an historic site should not be sold.As to the use tho War Offioe wish to make of this ground I leavd it entirely in your hands and shall be glad to do anything I can to assist.Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) John J,Calder,(TJIIg &quot;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.P.215 (27) Copy No, 3()CabinetSECRET Offer of &quot;Hill 60&quot; to the Nation.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I subjoin a oopy of a letter I have reoeived from Mr. John Calder of Messrs S.Allsopp and Sons, limited, offering aorlala    &quot;Hill 60&quot; to the Nation.   I also subjoin a draft of the reply
War Office,Whitehall, S.W.1.July, I927.Draft.Dear Mr,Calder,I thank you warmly for your generous offer to present to the Nation &quot;Hill 60&quot; where so many soldiers of the British Empire lost their lives,I proposet if you concur, to ask the Imperial War Graves Commission to accept transfer of the land and in future to maintain it.You probably know that the Imperial War Graves Commission is a body incorporated by Charter and consists of representatives of all the nations of the British Commonwealth.    The Commission has an organisation in Belgium which administers and maintains the existing Memorials and Cemeteries and it would be better to vest &quot;Hill 60&quot; in that organisation rather than to set up an organisation ad hoc.Moreover, the memories of &quot;Hill 60&quot; belong not to the British Army alone, but also to the soldiers of the Dominions, and it would be fitting, and I feel sure in accordance with the spirit of your kind offer that the Imperial War Graves Commission should accept charge of the sacred ground.John J,Calder, Esq.
