Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1927.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.     30CP. 244 (27).MEMORANDUM RESPECTING THE EFFECT ON PUBLIC OPINION IN THE UNITED STATES OF LORD CECIL&apos;S RESIGNATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT.(Circulated by Direction of the. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.)IN a despatch dated the 12th September last Sir Esme Howard, after quoting a number of American press references to Lord cecils resignation, concludes that this event &quot; has not made any serious impression on public opinion here with regard to the conclusion of the Geneva Conference.&quot; As a corrective of the above inference, Sir Esme quotes a statement recently made to him by Sir Arthur Willert when passing through Washington, to the effect that several financial gentlemen of Sir Arthur&apos;s acquaintance, who, before the statement issued by Lord Cecil on his resignation, had been of opinion that His Majesty s Government had probably had a good deal of right on their side, now believe that the United States Government were justified in the line they had taken. While admitting that this may be the attitude of certain individuals, the Ambassador is, nevertheless, inclined to think that public opinion generally regarding the Geneva Conference will not be greatly altered by Lord Cecil&apos;s statement.Sir Esme Howard&apos;s above conclusion is not altogether shared by the department, judging from the material at its disposal, nor by Sir Arthur Willert, who has just returned from the United States. As examples of the revival of American self-righteousness to which Lord Cecil&apos;s resignation has given rise, the following American press references are quoted at random : 1. The &quot;Philadelphia Public Ledger&quot; (an influential newspaper) published an article on the 31st August containing the following paragraph : &quot; Lord Cecil&apos;s letter of resignation was a stinging rebuke to the majority in the Baldwin Cabinet. It seems definitely to prove that the British entered the Geneva Conference only to wreck it. This naturally suggests a little further consideration of the British Navy, of what it has meant in the past and what it may mean in the future.&quot;Summarising press opinion on the 9th September, the British Library of Information in New York declared that large sections of Middle Western opinion interpreted Lord Cecil&apos;s resignation as a confession of Great Britain&apos;s fault at the Naval Conference, and a clear vindication of the American position. It also served as an occasion for much venting of the obvious dislike in which His Majesty&apos;s present Government is held.2.   The &quot; St. Louis Globe Democrat &quot; stated on the 31st August: &quot; He (Lord Cecil) will dispel the prevalent notion in England that the failure of the conference was largely due to American stubbornness.&quot;3.   The &quot; Pittsburgh Post Gazette,&quot; writing on the same date, stated :  &quot; Lord Cecil has done a service to the Kellogg administration of our State Department &apos;&apos;;while such phrases as &apos;; a rebuke to British Toryism&quot; are typical of American editorial comment.4150   [16685]
4. The Liberal Scripps Howard Alliance newspapers are so confident that the resignation of Lord Cecil will prove a deadly blow to the Government that they are already counting the seats in the next general election.5. Southern opinion may be summed up in the words of the &quot; Memphis Commercial Appeal &quot; of the 31st August: &quot; Another jolt like that of the resignation of Lord Robert Cecil from the Baldwin Cabinet may open the eyes of the British people as to where the blame must be placed for the failure of the Arms Limitation Conference at Geneva.&quot;The above quotations appear to me to be representative of most of the American press comment on this question.Finally, Mr. Coolidge&apos;s own view is worthy of note. It is summarised as follows by the correspondent of the &quot; New York Times &quot; at Rapid City, in a message dated the 6th September : &quot; Unless Lord Cecil&apos;s retirement from the British Cabinet as a protest against Great Britain&apos;s attitude on limitation of auxiliary cruisers . . . . causes a decisive reaction against the British Government&apos;s position, there appears to be little hope that the movement for reduction of naval armament will succeed in the near future, perhaps not during President Coolidge&apos;s term of office.&quot;In other words, the President, who had originally been reported as still hoping that an agreement might eventually be reached, now considers it a waste of time for him to talk of another Disarmament Conference since Lord Cecil is no longer in the Cabinet.Foreign Office, October 11,1927.
