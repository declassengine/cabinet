Rote by the Secretary,  Cabinet.On the Uth April,  1927,  the Cabinet had before them memoranda by the First Commissioner of Works, (Paper CP. Ho. 119 (27)) and the Minister of agriculture and Fisheries (Paper Bo. CP, 124 (27)), in regard to the desire of the City Corporation to obtain the site of the Custom House with a view to extending the buildings of Billingsgate Market in return for rehousing the Custom1s headquarters staff on a suitable site and in a suitable building.     After a short explanation ox the First Commissioner of iaForks the Cabinet agreed to postpone the question until after the Easter Recess,   (Cabinet 27(27),   Conclusion 6).Che Prime Minister has recently received a letter from the First Commissioner of Works, a copy of which is attached, from which it will be seen that Lord Peel no longer feelt able to oppose the wishes of the  Corporation and that he proposes to proceed with negotiations with that body for the disposal of the Custom House on suitable terms.The Prime Minister proposes to invite the Cabinet to take note of Lord Peel^s letter on an early occasion.(Signed) M.P.A. HA1IKEY.Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. September 29th, 1927,
E.LI. OPFIOn 0? V/ORKS,Stcreyrs Gate-, 231)Westminster,  S.W.17th September,  1927.My dear Prime li*.nister.You. will remember that I submitted a memorandum to the Cabinet on the 8th April last - CP. 119(27) - on the subject of the acquisition of the Custom House site by the City Corporation for an extension of the Billingsgate Market,drawing special attention to the possibility of a public outcry at the threatened destruction of a notable building, and that the Minister of Agriculture supported the case for the Market extension in a memorandum dated 12th April - CP. 124(27).You subsequently expressed the wish that the Royal Pins Art Commission might be consulted and I have now been favoured with their views.    The Royal Commission cannot advise that the building in itself possesses exceptional qualities although it is a well-proportioned building, notable alike for its prominence and scale, and undoubtedly confers distinction upon an Important section of the Pool of London. They would regret its disappearance as reducing the already small number of surviving examples of its date but recognise that its demolition may he necessary if it stands in the way of an important public improvenont if no alternative exists.The Minister of agriculture has produced a vary strong case for the retention of the market on the present site and also for its extension.    I have consulted the Minister of Transport who is satisfied that, from the traffic point of view,  an extension of the Market eastwards over the Custom House site would undoubtedly be the most satisfactory method of providing additional accommodation.
In these circumstances I do not feel able any-longer to oppose the wishes of the Corporation and I propose to proceed with negotiations with that body for the disposal of the Custom House on suitable terms.    It is essential, however, that if and when terms (which will-, of course,  be the subject of detailed discussion with the Treasury) are arranged, no question of the retention of the building on architectural or other grounds of a similar character will be allowed to interfere with the project, and I take it that I shall have the support of the Government in resisting any outcry that may result.Yours sincerely,(Signed) PJJL.The St. Hon. Stanley Baldwin, McP,\
