SECRET.CP. 222/27.MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.I LEARN from a person who ought to be well informed that M. Briand&apos;s proposal for a Franco-American Pact to outlaw war is very brief and merely amounts to a mutual promise not to resort to war for the settlement of any dispute between the two countries. M. Briand does not specify what machinery would be set up to obtain this result and the Department of State in Washington consider that the draft pact, while unobjectionable in itself, adds nothing to the Root and Bryan Arbitration Treaties. Indeed the fact that the French proposal contains no plan for the settlement of disputes has resulted in its receiving rather a cool welcome at Washington. The Department of State are believed to feel that, although there might be no objection to the conclusion of such a treaty with France alone, there would be serious objections to negotiating similar treaties with Great Britain, Japan. Germany, &amp;c.At the moment it would seem that Mr. Kellogg is merely marking time.From the same source I gather that the Japanese are much interested in the proposed Franco-American Pact with a view to some similar agreement being arrived at between Japan and the United States by expanding the existing Arbitration Treaty. I am told that there was some mention of the matter in conversations between members of the United States and Japanese delegations at Geneva.A. C.Foreign Office, August 9, 1927.4073   [16512]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1927.
