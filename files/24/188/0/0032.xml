On Friday the 29th July, I was eisked by the Governor of the Bank of i&amp;igland whether I was in a position to give the views of His Majesty1s Government upon Sir William Pleader&apos;s memorandum of the 22nd June relating to the armament business of Vickers aid. Armstrongs, As the Committee knows it vv&amp;s not found possible to hold a meeting before the recess but the views of the three service departments upon the proposals contained in the memorandam had been very clearly expressed in the memoranda iLFoC (27) 2,  3 and 4.     It was obviously undesirable that the authors of the scheme should be completely held up over the holidays and I therefore took the responsibility of sending to the Governor of the&quot; Bank the following letter which certainly represents my ovm views and I think is not inconsistent with those of the service departments as expressed in the memorandr referred to above.W.S.C.Treasury Chambers, So&quot;?- 1.10th August,   1927.SHIS JOCTCtSST If* :-TLZ FROSTY GF EI3 3RITANUI0 IIAJE3TYr5 SOV^RN^BKT) .S 2 C R JS I.

CRBASuTt? CHAMBERS,Whitehall, 3.W. 1.29th July,  19 27Dear Mr. Governor,With reference to your letter of the 22nd Jane forwarding a memorandum on the subject of the armament business of Viewers and Armstrongs, the Government would in general be anxious to encourage am.aigam.itions such as&apos;that proposed between the companies in -uestion, and as regards the Stamp Duties on such amalgamations they have already taken such steps as &quot;were open to them in passing Clause 53 of the Finance Act.     They fear, however,  that it would net be possible for them to agree to either of the alternative proposals put forward in paragraphs 5,  6 and 7 of the memorandum.Yours very sincerely,(Signed) WIJTST-from S. CHURCHILL.
