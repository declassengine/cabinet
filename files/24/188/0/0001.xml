SECRET. . 201(27).THIS UOOUii&amp;MT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Copy No..CABINET.Position of the Heavy Steel Industry.Note by the  resident of the Board of Trade.I must ask for a Cabinet decision on the reply I am to make to a renewed application which haB been made by the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers for a safeguarding duty.I attach (Appendix A), the application which I have received with a request that it shall be laid before the Government.     I set out at the end of this memorandum the reply given by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 21st December, 1925.     The federation claim that the answer meant that If circumstances changed for the worse the Government would reconsider the claim to a duty.     But the statement that the Government would keep the industry under observation was made&quot;with a view to promoting its well-being should any other measures be deemed desirable&quot;.   The Federation on the other hand contend that the sentence &quot;in all the circumstances of the present time we have come to the conclusion that the application cannot be granted&quot; meant that the question of principle was not finally decided.If the Cabinet hold that their decision was intended definitely to rule out any duty on iron and steel   in the life-time of the present Parliament I think the industry should be so informed once and for all.In that case I hope nothing will be said about other measures.   We have introduced in the Finance Bill this year a remission of stamp duty on amalgamations.     Beyond this no other measures are possible except (l) direct financial
assistance, which I assume to be definitely ruled out, and (2) prohibition and licence which is ruled out by our declared policy, in all international affairs since the war, and incidentally by several of our commercial treaties which give effect to that policy.The figures whioh are set out in the memorandum of the Federation are rather difficult to follow as in several cases they do not compare like with like.     For example, where the imports and exports in Table A of the memorandum are comparable with one another,they include a much wider range of articles than are contained in the figures of production of steel ingots and oastings.     The fairest picture I can give of production of iron and steel in this country, and of the imports and exports of iron and steel, is set out in Appendix B to this memorandum.    I have also set out in Appendix 0 the production of iron and steel in the principal foreign countries in 1913, and in the last three years.I find it very difficult to forecast the future.   No steel maker will venture to do so.   All are pessimistic.   I think it is certain that the rate of production of the first half of this year will not be maintained.   But I can offer no-view of any value as to the extent to which it will contraot. I think the majority of large steel makers are losing money at the present time.      It is impossible to say what the position would be if amalgamatiorswere effected which enabled a smaller number of works to work something like full time.   Several prominent people in the industry are trying to arrange amalgamations, and I have urged all the firms very strongly to join in these amalgamations, but the prospects are not very hopeful.Amalgamations would certainly not wipe out the difference in cost between British and foreign production.The following figures, I believe, give fairly the oharges which British firms have to meet in exoess of those
&quot;borne by their foreign competitors: -(1) Rates 4/7 per ton. (2) Social services 4/3 per ton (3) Debenture charges 6/3 per ton.I cannot estimate corresponding foreign oosts under (1) (2, and (3); but they are of course substantially lower,(4) Extra wage cost in this country, assuming wages to be 20 per cent of total oosts:-(a) 10/- per ton more than Germanyj(b) 13/- per ton more than Prance.(5) Difference between 3-hour day (or less) in England and German hours, 10/- per ton.I believe these figures to be substantially correct, and they undoubtedly confirm, what indeed v/as admitted in the Prime Minister&apos;s answer in the House, that, if the Iron and Steel industry be considered on its own merits, its claim for a duty is established.The Federation in para. 3b of their memorandum state that the prices quoted in the British market for Continental products are at or below their cost level, and that this Is admitted by Continental countries.    I very much doubt whether a case could be made under the permanent anti-dumping provision of the Safeguarding of Industries Act.    In order- to establish such a case the applicants must prove that goods are being sold here 5fo below the wholesale price charged at the foreign works.    If, however, the industry could show a prima facie case on dumping alone, I must ask for a decision of the.Cabinet as to whether such an application should be granted or refused.    I attach for convenience,  (Appendix D) -a copy of the relevant sections of the Safeguarding of Industries Act.P.C.L.Board of Trade,15th July, 1027.
HOUSE     OP      COMMONS Official Debates.21/12/35.    Col. No. 1947.IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY. Government Decision.Captain Arthur Evans asked the Prime Minister if he 13 yet in a position to state whether any decision has yet been arrived at by the Civil Researoli Committee in respect of the iron and steel industry?Mr. Remer asked the Prime Minister if he can new state the decision of the Government as to the application of the steel industry for protection under the Safeguarding of Industries Act; and if he has received a memorandum from the leading steel manufacturers to the effect that unless something is done quickly a financial crisis will arise?The Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin): The application of the iron and steel trades to the Board of Trade for the appoint-ment of a Committee under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure was referred to the Committee of Civil Research, and its Report has been received by the Cabinet.    The Civil Research Committee   has given the subject prolonged and detailed consideration, and has heard a large number of witnesses, representing employers and employed, engaged in the iron and steel industries and in allied trades.    The evidence revealed a serious situation.   The pressure of foreign competition, aided by long hours, low wages and depreciated currencies, is being severely felt by cur-manufacturers, and had His Majesty5s Government been able to deal with the iron and steel industries in isolation we might have regarded the case for inquiry as complete.    It-became clear, however, in the course of our investigations, that the safeguarding of a basic industry of this magnitude would have repercussions of a far wider character which might be held to be in conflict with our declarati On in re caret to a general tariff.    In all the circumstances of the present time, we have come to the conclusion that the application cannot be granted.    The Government will keep these industries under close observation with a view to promoting their well-being 3hould any other measures be deemed desirable.    It is hoped that the loan for railway development in East Africa which was recently approved will be found helpful, and further similar projects are under consideration.Mr. Remer:    Has the Prime Minister received the memorandum referred to in the last part of my question?The Prime Minister:    Yes, Sir.Mr. Remer:    In view of his answer, might I ask if he would arrange for a Debate on this subject before we adjourn.Mr. MacLeanj Is it the intention to publish the evidenc. taken during the investigations of this Committee?The Prime Minister:     No, Sir.
APPENDIX   A.PEAT, MARWICK, MITCHELL &amp; CO., (W.B. Peat &amp; Co.)11, Ironmonger Lane, London, E.C.2. 8th July, 1927. The Right Hon&apos;ble Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister,K * E r E i f   il  C * *   M * P.President cf the Board of Trade, Great George Street, Westminster, S-V/.1.Sir,A fully representative Conrmittee of the Heavy Section of the Steel industry have given earnest consideration to the present position of the industry, which they view with grave concern.As a result of such consideration I an directed to submit to you the enclosed memorial on behalf of the  -eavy Section of the Steel industry.    7/hile it is understood that different sections of the industry also have the present position under immediate consideration, this memorial is submitted particularly on behalf of those interested in the products specifically referred to therein.    While my Committee realise that H.M. Government have given particular and detailed consideration to the peculiar conditions affecting the British iron and steel industry, they feel that H.H. Government oannot be fully aware of the increasing gravity of the situation, since this matter was last considered by them in the Autumn of 19S5, culminating   in the pronouncement by the Prime Minister on December 21st of that year;    which pronouncement my Committee feel places upon them a peculiar responsibility to make H.JLI. Government aware of the seriousness of the position and the probable consequences that may flow from its continuance.Representatives of my Committee will be prepared to -rait upon you at any time to discuss the present position and any possible measures H.I.I. Government may feel able to take, in co-operation tfith the industry, to enable it to surmount the present crisis during the period of the economic re-adjustment in Europe.
It is suggested that special measures must be taken which will, as far as possible, prevent the necessity for a reduction in the general standard of living of the workers, but unless such measures can be taken, it is the view of my Committee that a reduction of the standard of living will be forced upon the workers in the bsavy steel industry by the permanent contraction, if not collapse of the industry.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)    C.U. PeatSecretary of the Committee.
Copy.PEAT, MAR WICK, MITCHELL &amp; CO. (iV.B.Peat &amp; Co.)11, Ironmonger Lane, London, E.C.2.7th July, 1927.Memorandum on the position of the British Heavy Steel Industry.The Statement of the Prime Minister in reporting to the House of Commons on 21st   December, 1925, the result of the investigation by the Civil Research Committee into the con-dition of the iron and steel industry, embodied the following provision :-&quot;The Government will keep these industries under close observation with a view to promoting their well being should any other measures be deemed desirable.&quot;This places upon the industry the responsibility of keeping His Majesty&apos;s Government informed as to the position, particularly when it is a matter of such grave concern as the present.The heavy Steel industry is the basis on which not only the defence of the country but most other productive industry is ultimately dependent.   The conditions under which It is at present working preclude the possibility of Its recovery within any reasonable time, and the permanent contraction of the industry is threatened owing to the fact that the resources necessary for its maintenance are no longer forthcoming, .the financial reserves of the industry having been exhausted,1. The products which may be considered as comprised within the Heavy Steel Industry are: Ingots, Blooms., Billets and Slabs; Sheet and Tinplate Bars; Steel Bars, Rods, Angles, Shapes, Channels and Sections; Girders, Beams and Joists, Plates and Sheets l/8&quot; and over; Tram Rails and Railway Rails.

These are included in the total figures of coal consumption given above.In considering Table (a) it must be borne in mind that the productive oapacity of the country was increased by at least50% during the war.     The high production in the first five monthsof 1927 was caused by the accumulation of orders due to thestrike, and was not due to any special revival of trade, and production is already reoeding from these high levels.-2-2. The following tables show:-(a) The production of steel ingots and castings and the total Imports and exports of all iron and steel expressed as a monthly average in 1913, 1924, 1925, 1926 and the first five months in 1927.Monthly Ayerage - in thousands of tons.
3. It will te seen that imports are atoadily increasing. These imports are the resultant of many factors contributing to make the prioe of Continental steel much lower than British, the chief of whioh are:-(a) The depreciation or uncertainty in the exchanges, e.g.,in the case of Belgium the frano was deliberately stabilised at a lower value externally than internally with a view to encouraging exports , while in the case of France it is the fear that &quot;de jure&quot; stabilisation may be effected at a higher gold level than the &quot;de facto&quot; which is the chief cause of exports being made at uneconomic prices.(b) The prices quoted in the British market for Continentalproducts are at or below their cost level:    this is admitted by Continental countries.(c) Lower wages are paid and longer hours are worked on theContinent than in this country.   At a recent meeting of German iron and steel Industrialists it was claimed that the introduction of the eight-hour day would , Involve an increase of 10/- per ton in the cost of steel.    If British wage rates had to be paid this would still further inorease the cost, for wages in this country are 50 per cent, higher than the highest on the Continent.(d) British industry is further hampered by the high railway rates and by the enormous burden of local taxation and expenditure on social servioes.   The two latter represent 8/l0d, per ton in the case of plates, and a similar figure is incurred in connection with rails,  joists, etc.(e) Lower capital charges on the Continent due to theeffects of inflation and other causes.
- 4.  The technical and practical knowledge of the personnel of British industry is equal to any in the world, but it isnot possible at this stage in the world1s development to claim or attain such superiority as will enable it to supportthe extra burdens referred to and still be able to meet thecompetition of competitors who are not subject to the sameweight of taxation and industrial restrictions.     Very heavy expenditure is needed for replacements and improvements owing*to the rate at which plant becomes out of date, and the British industry is no longer in a position to earn sufficient money and accumulate reserves to make good its productive plant and to maintain its position in technical progress and improvements in relation to its competitors,5. The position is now reached where the nation is faced with a high importation and the definite contraction of the British Iron and Steel Industry,6, The suggestion that British industry has it within its power to compete under the conditions which have been described carries with it the suggestion that British industry has some extraordinary powers not possessed by competitors which enable it to support burdens which are not imposed upon them.      This only needs to be stated to be realised as fallacious.7. Rationalisation of the industry in the form of amalgamation or otherwise may do something to improve competitive power but can only prove permanently effective if the general economic conditions of the country are such as to enable the industry to compete.     The industry can no longer support the burdens imposed upon it by legislation and successfully meet competition in the markets of the world subsidised by the special advan-tages already described.     This will ultimately leave the finishing industries dependent to a large extent on foreign sources of supply, and involve thorn in their turn in ultimate contraction and possible extinction,
8.   With regard to the possibility of effecting inter-national arrangements having for their object the regulation of markets and production to secure an economic return for the industry, and to absorb the labour normally employed therein, It is essential that some negotiating power be provided for the industry by a national policy which will convince Continental countries that a restriction of imports will be Imposed.     This is    of first importance as rationalis-ation of the industry must in its first effects increase unemployment, but the remedy for this is some security for an increased volume of production which would enable displaced men to be re-absorbed.9.   A greater security in the home market would result in an increased volume of production and thus reduce prices and assist In the expansion of the secondary and finishing industries as well as the primary industries such as mining and transport, with a consequent reduction in unemployment.10.   We therefore wish to invite the attention of the President of the Board of Trade, and through him of His Majestyls Government to the gravity of the present position, and to the fact that In our opinion it is impossible to maintain the British Heavy Steel industry at its present scale under present conditions.The necessity for action is obvious; already blast furnaces and coke ovens are going out of operation and un-employment tending to increase in this industry.It Is essential, therefore, that during the period of economic re-adjustment which is now proceeding in Europe, that a national policy shall be adopted which will offset the handicap under which British Iron and steel industry is working. If the higher standard of living is to be maintained in this country the industry cannot compete unless foreign competitors in the British market are taxed to an extent that adds to their costs
burdens equal to those supported by the British iron and steel industry.It is suggested that a policy be formulated which reoognisos the gravity of the present situation and that an import duty or import restrictions be adopted for a term of years, so devised as to become extinguished if conditions change by gradual Btages without causing any dislocation in industry or the domestic market.
