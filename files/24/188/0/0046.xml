ilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.OOPY NO.CABINET TRADE OUTLOOK* Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a record of the meeting of my Advisory Council held in October.The report is rather gloomy; and it does not look as If the volume of trade shown in the export figures of recent months would be maintained.      The position is aptly described by the President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce as &quot;dull with sunny intervals&quot;.In coal, although there is a large output, prices are very bad and heavy losses are being made.    There does not seem to be much prospect of an improvement in prices in the export trade at any ratej indeed new contracts are being entered into at lower prices than current contracts.     Both Germans and Poles are keen competitors, and it is thought that they are not losing money on the prices they quote.In iron and steel again the prices are very lowj and I am afraid there is no doubt a good deal of business is   being done at a loss.       It is still too early to judge the effect of the rebate scheme, but there is a rather better tendenoy to place orders.    The Sheffield trade has suffered an unexpected setback. The tin plate trade is very bad.     This trade is becoming more and more dependent on Empire markets, and the partial failure of the fruit crops has affeoted it.    It is greatly to be hoped that the German Government will maintain their decision to revoke the decree permitting a ten hour day in the steel trade and will revert to eight hours.    It is estimated in Germany that this   would add as much as 10/- a ton to their costs.$RET. ).247(27)
Trr.de in non-ferrous metals is poor, and expectations have not been realised.Shipbuilding looks satisfactory until you compare the number of orders placed in the last quarter with the two previous quarters.   . There is a satisfactory amountof tonnage under construction at the moment, and ve are maintaining our relative world position; but unless a large number of new orders are placed in the near future, there will be a serious increase of unemployment in the spring.Engineering is more satisfactory; and the Cabinet will &apos; be interested to see from Mr. Bro-vnlie&apos;s statement that relations between employers and workers are good.In cotton the orders which were hoped for when the price of raw cotton began to rise are not materialising. Sir V/illiam Clare Lee&apos;s analysis shews that we must look forward to a considerable reduction in world purchases of our cotton goods as compared with pre-war.    This is not so much due to our losing our relative position in the export trade as to the fact that other countries are manufacturing more of their own requirements.The position in the worsted trade remains serious.    An inorease in the export of yarns is more than counterbalanced by diminished production of cloth.The account which Mr. Hill gives of our lead in bio-chemical productions is encouraging.The boot and shoe trade is fair..There are some hopeful signs in overseas market.    Indian purchasing power is steadily increasing; and the decision of the Indian Government as regards the tariff both on steel and cotton should help us.     The Argentine is very prosperous and the favourable trade balance there coupled with an active movement to buy British rather than American goods should help us.    There are some indications of a reviving
trade in parts of China.I have several times drawn attention to the undoubted fact that the home market is becoming increasingly important to our manufacturers.    This is plain from the trade returns. It is strikingly confirmed by the account which both Mr. Debenham and Mr. Hayhurst give of increased buying at home.     Mr. Debenham speaks for the big stores, Mr. Hayhurst for the co-operative societies.    The experience of both is that the volume of purchases at home is steadily increasing.P, C.-L.Board of Trade,18th October, 1937.

-i n oCOHFIDFJfTIAL.COAL.SIR ADAM NllvJliO thought that the position in the coal industry might be summed up by saying that it was pursuing a difficult course.    It was very difficult just now to give a general view of the industry because it varied so much in different districts.    Those districts which had to rely very largely upon the export trade seemed to be in a particularly difficult position because the foreign prices that had to be met were exceedingly low and seemed to be goin6 even lower. The tendency was, of course,  to bring down the whole of the prices in the exporting districts to the level of what we had to take in order to command the export trade.    The volume of trade being done did not seem to be so bad on the whole.    The output for the week ending 27th August had been 4,682,000 tons, x-or the week ending 3rd September it was i,881,000 tons; for that ending 10th September;, 4,657,000 tons; and for the week ending 17th September, 4,979,000 tons.    The output, however, for the last week referred to was 95 per cent of the output for March, 1925, but appreciably higher than that for the corresponding week in September,  1925, which was 4,044,000 tons *The output per person per week was undoubtedly steadily rising.    That might be regarded as one of the most important factors in indicating the comparative efficiency of the industry.    The figure we had now for the week ended 17th September,  for the output per person per wee;, was about 109.3 per cent of the figure for March, 1925, and that probably showed that the collieries were putting machinery into the pits as hard as they could,  so as to get up the output per person employed and thereby reduce the cost of production.The shipments were, if anything, a little better than they had been.    The shipments from all ports in Great Britain for the week ended 27th August gave a total of 1,172,000 tons in round figures.    For the week ending 17th September that figure had risen to 1,311,000 tons and the intervening weeks showed also a little progress in expansion.As regards coal exported from Great Britain, the total for August was 4,257,000 tons as compared with 4,176,000 tons for July.    The unemployment figure in August was also rather better than it had been during July, being 19.9J&amp; as compared with 21% in July, and the number of days that were worked per week in August was just slightly more than in July, namely -*.63 in August as against 4.43 in July.The position on the Continent was moving,  Sir Adam thought, so far as output was concerned, a little against us-German output was not only holding its own but had a tendency rather to expand.    During the week ending 17th September it amounted to 2,245,000 tons of coal.    In March 1926 the average weekly output had been 1,888,000.    It was understood that this did not include lignite.    Their stocks of coal, of course, were fairly substantial,  but these did not seem to be rising very much, if at all, now.    It showed that they were able to get rid of even their larger output to-day.    ilixports
COAL (CONTD.).from Germany had also very substantially risen from 2,151,000 tons in March, 1926,  to a figure, covering both free exports and reparations, of 2,364,000 tons in August last. But the most notable expansion in the export trade had been of course in the iolish Silesian coalfields.    Their exports last August were given as 1,031,000 tons,  as compared with 910,000 tons for July.    The corresponding figure in March 1926 from Silesia was 590,000 tons.    In all the Baltic markets this was the competition which we were finding the most severe, and the prices which had got to be taken in our export districts to meet that competition were exceedingly low-    To give an indication of the very low values that this had forced our coalfields down to, in Scotland for the month of August our ascertainments showed as low a price as 11/- per ton of coal produced.LORD GAINFGRD confirmed what Sir A. Nimmo had said,  so far as the collieries on the North Last Coast were concerned-Enormous sums had been lost during the long cessation of operations last year and our resources were very much exhausted by endeavouring to maintain the collieries during that period.    We had now to meet a world-price for coal which was much below the general cost of production.    Most countries were losing heavily at the present moment, but we felt that probably we had reached the bottom price in the competition which was necessary in order to recover our customers and our export trade.    &apos;*7e had made a struggle for it, and vie had succeeded at a considerable loss, and business at the present time was unprofitable;  but we realised that the foreigner who was in competition with us was also getting very restless, being no longer able to produce his commodity at the prevailing prices.    Therefore, having got to the bottom, we were looking forv/ard to some improvement,  although it could only be a gradual one.On the North East Coast there was a fair demand for household coal, and prices would probably not be advanced for another two or three weeks, when the winter demand would oome on and probably justify an increase in price.    Coicing coals and bunkers had receded by 6d. a ton, during, the past month but.gas coal had maintained its position.    Foundry coke was in steady demand,  but keen competition was being-met with all over the country as well as from abroad.    There was no improvement in the demand for blast furnace coke. At the present moment nearly all the blast furnaces on the North East coast vvere out.    There were only three firms in the district now with blast furnaces at work.IRON AND STEEL.LORD GAINFORD reported that the price of hematite pig iron had fallen 15/- whilst the ore had increased about 9-gd. a ton. It took two tons of hematite ore to make one ton of hematite pig iron,  so that the position of our manufacturers of hematite iron was serious.    There was keen competition from the Continent in connection with foundry iron, and attention
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).should he drawn to the way in which the French were con-ducting their trade at the present time.    It was a bad case of dumping,    Makers in Prance were asking their own consumers 1?/Sd per ton above the prioe at   which they were willing to sell pig iron for export.    The cost of French foundry iron today in English money was about 60/-.    Some of the French exporters were adhering to 65/&apos;- but a good number of them vere taking as low as 57/6., and if the cost of transport, say 5/-, were deducted, this would leave the maker only 52/6 free on trucks at his own works, whereas the cost of his commodity was 60/-.    he was, therefore, dumping to the extent of 7/6d.  on us,  whilst he was taking from his people a price of 17/6d above that whioh he was realising, from ourselves.In connection with the steel trade, no steel had been bought during August on account of the rebate scheme which came into force on 1st September.    Several orders for ships were placed on the North jast Coast which had slightly increased the demand for certain kinds of steel.    It seemed to be the general opinion that the rebate scheme would take tirue to show any good effect,  and it was feared that a good deal of importation of Continental steel would continue. The price of Continental steel was reported to be at least  2 a ton lower than British to firms who had not entered the rebate scheme.MR. BOND pointed out that Lord Gainford had spoken of the iron and steel industry ae regards the North East Coast. That reported was applicable also to the industry in other parts of the country.    The production of pig, iron had shown a decline from 645,800 tons in July to 596,100 tons in August and the number of furnaces in blast declined by 9 during August.    The furnaces blowing- at the end of August numbered 165, or 24 less than when the maximum had&apos; been reached in April.    Steel production had declined from 687,100 tons in July to 644,500 tons in August and was thus 300,000 tons less than in March when the maximum production was recorded.    Imports of iron and steel in August had shown a decline of some 50,000 tons to a level of 286,000 tons, which was still 100,000 more than the monthly imports in 1913 and 60,000 tons more than the monthly average for 1925. The   exports of iron and steel in August had also declined from 389,000 to 342,000.Except for some increase in demand due to the rather greater activity in shipbuilding, the position was but littl better than before the coal strike. There was a disposition on the part of consumers to realise that recent reductions had brought prices to a very low level, and although buying had not been on a large scale, there had been more disposi-tion to place business for delivery over the next few months instead of only for immediate delivery.    It was probably true to say that the drop in pig iron prices made it more economio in most districts to buy British rather than foreign pig iron, and that when deliveries under
CONFIDENTIAL . IRON  iUD STEEL (CONTD).current contracts were completed, imports of pig iron were likely in most districts to be small.   They had declined since December- last, when they were 112,000, to 51,000 tone in August *It w8s early yet to gauge the effects of the rebate scheme introduced on the 1st September.    Purchasers could not claim the rebate until the.fourth month after delivery, and whether It proved acceptable or not would depend very largely on the proportion of foreign steel which individual branches .3T the Industry had been buying.    In shipbuilding, where purchases of foreign steel constituted;, perhaps, up to about twenty per cent of the total used, acceptance of the rebate scheme would seem to pay the shipbuilders, and there were other advantages incidental to buying British material which should turn the scale.In Germany the Government had Issued a decree to the effect that employers must revert from the present ten-hour day to the eight-hour day in the steel works and rolling mills as from 1st January next,   One of the leaders of the industry over there had said that this would increase the cost of steel making by 10/- per ingot ton.   The workers took the view that, even if that was so, it ought to be possible to bear this increased cost from the economies consequent on what was now called Nationalisation&apos;.   The probability of increased costs had made the German industry more than ever keen on the constitution of selling syndicates under the aegis of the International Steel Kartel.    Germany was unwilling to accept the unremunerative prices for export to which French and Belgian competition had driven them, and they were equally averse from subsidising French exports by means of the Kartel, which is what they had been driven to, since Germany had consistently exceeded her quota for the last three quarters, whereas France had not produced up to her quota.   Germany had, therefore, been paying fines into the pool for over-production, and France had been receiving compensation for under-production. At the last meeting of the Kartel Germany was understood to have succeeded in having the fine for over-production reduced to $1 per ton for home production.    In the previous quarter the fine had been dropped from ^4 to $2.   These facts pointed to rising prices on the Continent, but it was doubtful whether they would rise sufficiently to enable Britain more effectively to compete.The condition of the steel industry in South Wales was worse than in any other part of the country,  owing to the depressed condition of the tin plate industry, and that was partly due to the failure of vegetable and fruit crops in many parts of the world.   The industry was largely dependent upon canning, and from the Pacific Coast to Australia, and right across Europe, the crops had failed to an extraordinary extent. It was also, however, partly due to intense competition from, the United States and to some extent from Germany.     Both countries had a high barrier against us in tin plate and were exporting their surplus production at prices much under their domestic price.   7/e were becoming more 8nd more dependent, in the tin plate industry,  on the Empire markets and the more we could encourage the Dominions to send their canned goods here the better It would be for the Welsh trade.
90 q (CoOSTEEL.SIR ARTHUR balfour reported that the Sheffield steel trade was very unsatisfactory.    The rolling mills and forges were in a very poor way indeed.    All the special difficult lines were being ordered in this country at the present time and orders for the big lines were going elsewhere.    The cutlery trade was very quiet.    There was a good deal of competition from Germany in scissors, whioh were being sold at extraordinarily low prices, far below the prices at which they could be produced in Sheffield.    There was still a fair amount of stainless steel, and the demand for high speed pressed steels and general engineering tools and files was fairly good.    As regards the European trade Sheffield was gradually being pushed out altogether.    France was practically a closed market for Sheffield, as well as for American and other manufacturers,  today.    In Spain we were having a very hard struggle and losing ground.    Belgium was very hard to hold, on account of the French competition there.    In Germany we had started to recover our trade, but through local patriotism and the cutting of prices we had lost that ground also.    Switzerland remained fairly good, and we were doing some trade in Italy in spite of the exchange.    However,  the prospects in the general engineering tool trade and the better steel trade for Sheffield in Europe were very bad indeed at the present time.As regards Australia, there had been rather a set-back there also.    Canada was quite a good market, having improved very considerably.    In spite of all the recent troubles we were still doing a fairly good trade with China.    Of course v/e were getting our money in advance.    But Japan was very bad.    Until the Japanese remodelled their revenue system there was practically no hope of any steady progress in trade with them at all.    The South American trade was fair. We found a good deal of competition from Germany, but still were managing to overcome it.    Trade with the United States was almost impossible.    We were still doing a little in special sections but nothing with any bulk in it.Signs were evident in Sheffield,  in the li&amp;ht casting trade and that type of trade,  of a big falling off in building.^&apos;   On the other hand there had been an improvement in colliery tools and equipment; and gold mining and general mining and dredging appliances were selling better.    There was still a feeling that prices had not touched the bottom, and as long as that remained we were not likely to do any big business.    The trade in alloys, which gave a very good indication of the Sheffield trades as a whole, had been fairly    good,  though a little bit below normal.    But the general report was not altogether very satisfactory.    Things were uncertain.    People were holding back and were not really buying.NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD wrote:-&quot;I have a poor account to give of the conditions prevailing in the metal trades.    August was a bad month and September even worse, and I cannot see that there are yet any
NOfl-gjlHROUS METALS (CONTD.).signs of improvement.    I should have to go baok many years to find a parallel to the extreme dulness which has prevailed for the last eight or nine weeics, and the expectations indulged in during the summer of an improvement later on have not materialised, and there are no signs discernible of their doing 30.&quot;ENGINEERING.MR. BR0F/NLI3 wrote:-&quot;I would refer to the statement that I made at the July meeting with regard to the offer of an advance in wages of  /- per week to plain time workers made by the Engineering and Allied Employers&apos;  National Federation, to the Unions connected with the engineering industry.    On the -Employers&apos; proposal being submitted to a ballot vote of the membership Of the respective Organisations,  the result is as follows:-For acceptance.......8 ,531Against   &quot;        ........15**Majority..... 40,377&quot;V/ith regard to unemployment figures in relation to the Amalgamated Engineering Union the figures reported in the Union&apos;s Journal are as follows :.-July....... 14,099 a percentage of 6.78August..... 13,780 &quot; &quot; &quot; 6.64September.. 14,039 &quot; &quot; &quot; 6.75&quot;With reference to the latter figures, it should be noted that during the month of August, holidays in several parts of the country obtained, which will account for the increased percentage of unemployment.&quot;From general information in our possession we have reason to believe that the state of trade in the engineering industry may be considered relatively good.    Moreover, within recent date several large contracts for new ships and engines have been placed.&quot;In connection with the appeal made by the Prii^e Minister for co-operation of all the factors in industry, from information in my possession I have to say that the result of the advance in wages has materially improved the relations between the workpeople and their &quot;employers in the respective engineering establishments.    In my opinion it is in the workshops that the desired co-operation will be generated and secured.    Moreover, I have also to say that the relations&quot; between the Unions and the Engineering, Employersr Federation are good, inasmuch as the procedure for avoiding disputes and agreements arising therefrom are honourably observed by the parties concerned.&quot;
MARINE ENGINEERING.MR. RICHMOND proposed to restrict his remarks on this occasion to marine engineering in Scotland, particularly on the Clyde.     The number of vessels launched was a very fair index of the activity of the industry.     During September in Scotland there were launched 25 vessels of 64,757 tons, making a total for the 9 months of 220 vessels of 290,096 tons, as compared with 155 vessels of 263,748 tons in the same period last year. That was an increase of 65 vessels and 26,348 tons.     The marine engineering shops generally were moderately active. The distribution of the work was, however, rather patchy. The larger establishments were well employed but the small ones were not.     Contracts in hand at present should permit of the present amount of employment continuing probably until about February or March of next year, but very few new contracts were being placed, and unless a change took place almost immediately, we were certain to be&apos;faced with a serious falling off in employment in the Spring of next year.The steel rebate did not seem to have stimulated trade at all,  and there was an unusual lag between the time when enquiries were made out and the time when Orders were placed. Nowadays the shipowner had a choice of power movers;    there was the reciprocating engine, the turbine engine and the Diesel engine, and various factors had to be taken into account for the different shipping services which were now so complex that it seemed to take him much longer to come to a decision than formerly, when his choice was limited to steam turbines or the reciprocating engine.The wages position, of course, had been stabilized for six months, so that no trouble was anticipated during that period.      Then as regards unemployment - in August there had been in the engineering trade in Scotland 10,554 unemployed, which was 8.7 per cent, as against 9.3 in July and 10.2 in May.ELEC TRICAL ENGINEER ING.SIR PHILIP NASH wrote&quot;There is really very little change from, the report which I submitted on 4th August last.     It is not possible to discern any definite sign of improvement in the home market, but there is undoubtedly a better feeling and more confidence.     i think the effect of last year&apos;s coal strike has now worn off, and that we shall see a vez^y gradual improvement. As regards the export market, matters are just the same as when I reported in August last.&quot;SHIPBUILDING.SIR FREDERICK HENDERSON wrote:,I have little to add to my previous communication to you regarding this industry, but contracts placed at the end of last.year and in the early part of the present year,
after being held up by the coal dispute, are no?; reaching the finishing stages, and although there Is a fair volume of work approaching completion, the position now is that ships are being launched at a greater rate than new orders are are being placed.   Therefore the tide of work available is definitely receding.&quot;MOTOR CAR MANUFACTURE.SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT wrote:-&quot;The deputation from the British Motor Trade which has been visiting Australia and New Zealand, which by the way is the first and only Trade Deputation ?which has ever been sent from this country to Australia, has returned.   It is expected that their report will be available in a few weeks&apos; time.&quot;At this period of the year, prior to the Motor Shows, trade is usually in rather an unsettled state, as buyers wait to see if firms are putting new models on the market.&quot;There is a matter which, if suitably dealt with, could materially help the commercial side of the business.     I refer to the varying regulations affecting passenger and goods carrying vehicles which make it impossible for builders to standardise their products effectually.     The new Ministry of Transport regulations ought to be a help but, as long as Municipal Authorities and County Councils, when ordering, call for variations, and the London Police Authorities ask for their own requirements, it is impossible for manufacturers to produce standardised types of vehicles.     As long as this state of affairs goes on at home the industry cannot be really satisfactory.    Not only should conditions be uniform throughout Great Britain, but steps should be taken to get the Irish Free State, the Crown Colonies and Dominions to, as far as possible, adopt the British standards.&quot;Another thing which is detrimental to the Commercial Vehicle industry is the way in which freight vehicles are taxed by weight in comparatively few classes;    the steps being so great frequently causes the employment of vehicles which are not economical for some particular service.   For example, the user may have a load which is rather over 50 cwt. but&apos; knows that if he takes a suitable vehicle there will be a jump in his taxation from  26 to  40, so he takes the vehicle which has the lower tax and. overloads it, which is both bad for the Government and bad for the vehicle, as it means a loss in taxation and undue wear on the vehicle.   If cars are taxed horse-power by horse-power and commercial vehicles on weight, why should they not be cwt. by cwt?&quot;CONFIDENTIAL. SHIPBUILDING  (CONTD.) .
COTTON.SIR WILLIAM CLARE LESS said that with regard to the export trade in cotton piece goods, we could pretty well say how the year as a whole was going to turn out, because we had either already done the business, or it was already very largely on the booksa   Everybody in Manchester was very disappointed with the trade of the year,,     We had built up a theory a year or two ago that the world v/as able to expend 150 millions a year on our cotton piece goods, and that they would spend it; and then we had said that when we got cotton cheaper, san.es would increase.   In 1924-5 the average sales had been abovit 150 milliOB.3 sterling a year, and that was at a price of 8d. a yard.    Our average price for the first eight months this year had been just a fraction under 6d. and if the world had continued to spend as much money on cotton goo-is as, no doubt, they could spend today if they wished, we should have been working full time this year.   But the total purchases by foreign countries of our piece goods, instead of amounting to 150 millions, had been estimated at only 107 millions for the year.    The world, in fact, was spending as a v/hole, in its external purchases of cotton piece goods, very much less than it used to spend, and until it got the habit of spending more the total external trade of the world would, no doubt, be so much less.The consumption of cotton,  qua cotton, was higher than it had ever been;    but the external trade of the world in thi3 article, - which was, after all, the pool in which we had to fish, - was not proving resilient this year for anybody.    The position with regard to Japan v/as that their exports showed no increase over 1926 up to the present.    The Dutch East Indies were rather an interesting market to watch because they lay between Japan and ourselves.    Japan&apos;s imports to that market had increased a little but ours had also increased quite to our proper share.   The growth of our trade with India v/as also, probably, quite as rapid as could be expected, and if it continued for another year or so, we should have re-established our position there, except for grey goods.The United States of America had increased their exports over the 1926 total by a very little;    France had done so by 25%, but the French markets were in Africa, and we had done very well in the African markets;    Switzerland was up by nearly 20$, but those were all specialities, - not competitive goods. Italy&apos;s exports of cotton piece goods had decreased 15$;   and she was working short time.   Holland was very little up on 1926, - not as much up as we v/ere.   Germany was down, while Belgium showed a slight increase.   Czecho-Slovakia was up, and was perhaps our most virile competitor at the present moment;   but really there was nothing to indicate that we had lost our position;    it was a disappointing year for everybody throughout the world who had to export cotton piece goods.   Each country v/as making more for itself.During the first eight months about 72.3JS of the total machinery of Lancashire had been employed. The proportions varied very much, because whilst the fine section was fully employed, the medium section v/as very badly employed.
COTTON  (CONTP)Sir William handed In tables (reproduced at the end of this note of his remarks,) indicating, to the latest practicable date, the various proportions of our cotton piece goods taken by the several markets of * the v/orld with which we trade,    One of the significant features was that we were shown to be maintaining our position in Europe perhaps better than in almost any other part of the v/orld, and this indicated that our fine goods were penetrating into and holding the markets.    In the finished end of the trade we should perhaps gradually return to the full employment of the amount of machinery we previously employed, but this would mean   putting a very heavy load on one section of the trade, to pick up all the loss on greys.   That loss, as would be seen by the figures in one of the tables, was very heavy and a great deal of it might prove to be permanent.TABLES HANDED IN BY SIR W.

COTTON.  (CONTD.)COL. SEDDON BRO&quot;-VN wrote :-&quot;EgyptIan Soc11 on.    There.is nothing of special note-to report with regard to the Egyptian Section of the spinning trade.     Mills are generally running full time and business is fairly satisfactory.&quot;American Spinning Section.   In this section of the trade the conditions for the past few months have been most depressed.     Week after week goes by and the spinners cannot sell their production, even though in the majority of cases they are offering to sell at a loss.     If we take the last week for which figures are available, that io the week ending 24th September, spinners of American yarn only sold 45/S of their normal production.&quot;For some time past all members of the Cotton Yarn Association have been working short time, and members of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners Associations have also received a recommendation from that body to close their mills on Fridays and Mondays.      In addition to this short time, quite a number of spindles have been idle owing to bankruptcies.    The continuance of this bad trade,.for so long a period, is forcing mills almost daily, either into liquidation, or into the position where they have to make some scheme of arrangement with their creditors.&quot;During the past few weeks a Joint Committee has been sitting, composed of seven members representing the Federation and seven members representing the Cotton Yarn Association to see if they could find out some method whereby the Federation Members and the Cotton Yarn Association members could work together with regard to the amount of short time to be run, and with regard to the fixing of a minimum selling price,     I am a member of this Committee, representing the Federation, and although the Committee has agreed upon a joint scheme, which it has recommended to the trade, it is interesting to note that the first unanimous decision that the Committee came to after meeting was, that the cost of production in Lancashire was too high, to such an extent that Lancashire was unable to compete favourably with its competitors abroad.      The Committee has agreed to remain in session for the purpose of examining in detail the cost of production and with the hope of being able to report to the trade what action must be taken to get production costs down.      It was further agreed that, pending this investigation, something must be done in order to try to prevent the enormous losses which were going on, and a scheme for short time and the fixing of minimum prices has now been put into operation.
COTTON (OONTD.)&quot;The Federation is at present balloting its members with regard to the system of short time to bo adopted, and it issued to its members on September 30th last a list of minimum selling prices which were to be put into foroe on Monday last, uotober 3rd.   Whether these selling prices can be held or not, and whether the trade will be loyal to a scheme of combinod short time has yet to be proved, but in my opinion there is not the slightest doubt about It that, if Lancashire is to ever regain her export trade in this section of the cotton industry, costs of production have got to be lowered.HTo sum up this section of the industry, i can only say that the trade is as bad as it oan possibly be,  and that scores of firms are today in a desperate condition.&quot;Weaving.    The Weaving industry is very depressed.    It is estimated that about 20/o of tho looms of Lancashire are otanding idlej many of them for lack of work, others owing to bankruptcy.    In addition to this, short time,in-   one form or another, is being worked all over the county, although not organised short time.&quot;This section of the industry is suffering largely from the same troubles as the American spinning section; that is, its high costs of production puts Lancashire cloth out of competition with foreign manufacturers&quot;.WOOL.MR. AlKROYi) said that the textile trade in the West Riding was, generally, not in a good condition.    In spinning, botany particularly, the prospects for yarn were doubtful owing to the high prices of raw material and being compelled to hold for higher prices.    While sections of the hosiery or mule spinning were doing well, the frame-3pun wool, that is the cop and fly, was not in such good demand.    Home-trade weaving yarns were better employed during the last three months but manufacturers were complaining about lack of new business,    in the single yarns for export the leading spinners were busy but new business at an advanced price was not forthcoming. Generally speaking, however, a better spirit and rather more confidence were prevailing in this section of the trade, but there was a fear that Germany was over-trading internally, and owing to lack of exports might find it difficult to continue the present volume of trade.As regards manufactures, mens&apos;  wear showed a decided improvement.       The South American trade in these goods was normal.       Home and foreign trade for the best
WOOL (CONTD.)class goods was keeping up, but the ordinary dress goods, which really constituted the bulk of the Bradford trade, were in a very bad way.    The combing position was very irregular.    Some private concerns were running very well.    On the other hand, some l^rge commission combers were very badly placed.    At this time of year stocks were at the lowest ebb, but this fact in itself did not account entirely for the lack of business.    Combing prices abroad were less than combing prices here owing to a lower scale of wa^es.    As to the amount of raw wool retained in this country this year as compared with other recent years, Mr. Aykroyd promised to go into the figures, and send in a further communication.    He has subse-quently -written as follows&quot;Since our meeting yesterday I have just spent a little time with the figures which indicate our position in raw wool in this country, and below beg to give you those figures, which show that we have 311,283 in 100 lbs. less for home consumption than last year.&quot;These figures really explain themselves,  showing increased exports and increased imports but leaving us considerably less for our own machines in this country.RAW WOOL.Eight months Board of Trade figures - Jan.-Aug.,inclusive.1925. 1926. 1927.Imports... 5,353,479 6,351,166 6,497,655    in 100 lbs.Re-exports 2,212,952 2,420,095 2,776,523 ExportsDomestic.      306,385 267,850 369,194i!Increase foreign imports 1927 over 1926 - 146,489Increase re-exports &quot;       &quot;       &quot; 356,428 nIncrease domestic wool exports &quot; &quot; 101,344 11 Total increase exports    )domestic and re-exports) &quot;       &quot; 457,772 &quot;These figures show increased exports 457,772 &quot;increased imports 146,489Decrease left for home consumption. 311,283 &quot;As to raw material,  the September sales had just termination.-,-nated, with competition from all centres, closing with a hardening price at the highest point reached since last October,  but medium crossbreds were only 25 per cent higher than last December.    Germany had its production sold well ahead into this year and was doing a large business in selling manufactures to France.    The large loans received in the past two years had stimulated general business activity in Germany, and it would be interesting to note the effect, which was now apparent, of the decline in the volume of dollars that had been lent.    Textiles were undoubtedly at the peak of activity in Germany and the general feeling there was that business was likely to decline rather than increase.   We depended very much on our exports to Germany, so that this was a matter of great concern to us.    Summing up the whole position, it. might be said that there was more confidence and not that depressed feeling that we had had twelve months ago.
WOOL    (OONTD.)COLONEL WILLEY   observed that Mr. Aykroyd had dealt with the detailed position of the wool textile trade.   But there was the question also of instituting a collective examination of its problems.   Nothing had followed the suggestion which the President of the Board of Trade had made earlier in the year.   However, the wage agreement had been terminated as at the end of November for the whole industry, consisting of 240,000 employees, and the Operatives&apos; Unions had replied to that move on the part of the employers with a letter which definitely set out four points to which they would like attention to be directed before any further move was made.      It was interesting to see that the third point was the possibility of restoring trade by Safeguarding, coming as a definite request from the operatives as a necessary precedent to any wage revision. That was a new outlook in the wool textile trade.    The next point they made was the appointment of a Standing Advisory Committee to consider the present organisation of the industry which was really a method of implementing the suggestion which cane from the President of the Board of Trade at a Council meeting earlier in the year, whon Mr. Shaw -was present.    That letter from the Unions had not been replied to by the employers, and the position stood there at the present moment, that the wage agreement terminated at the end of November. Col. &quot;Villey agreed with the President that a great opportunity was presented of having a joint investigation by employers and employed into the whole position and prospects of the industry, but observed that there was no organisation in the industry which had pov/er at present to consider these questions.    The only existing organisation was the Joint Industrial Council which had hitherto specifically ruled out all questions other than hours and wages.   A reference was being made by the constituent Federations to their members for authority to sanction the consideration by the delegates to the Industrial Council of questions other than wages and hours.With regard to exports it -was interesting to see that our exports of tops and yarn had increased immensely.    Our exports of worsted cloth in the meantime had gone down progressively in the first eight months of the last three years from 33 to 30 and to 27 million square yards; so that our exports of tops and yarn were progressively increasing and our exports of manufactured goods &quot;fere progressively decreasing, which, of course, meant less employment and less returns here.It was stated, in regard to the Frenoh export of yarn, that the turnover tax in France was largely responsible for the great increase in those exports, because the Government gave a rebate on export, so that it was more advantageous to sell externally, even at a lower price, than to sell internally.     But those who had travelled recently in other countrijafl found that it was the three-shift operation in Continental countries, with muoh lower wages, which made competition on the part of this country specially difficult, and an attempt to meet that problem had been made in Yorkshire by a firm who carried on a two-shift operation. That had produced very strong hostility on the part of the
WOOL    (CONTD.)Trades Unions, even though there was no effect on the wages. It had never been tried before in this country, but it was an attempt to meet Continental competition.    It rather proved that our aim should be not bo much to ohange wages as to change Trade Union practices.ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR. ADDISON was able to report that business still continued satisfactory.   There was a different note in it, and considerable expansion was going on in this country at the present time;    but, even allowing for that additional expansion, the producers could not keep pace with the demand. The demand, except possibly in one or two districts, was very healthy and steady, and reports led one to believe that the goods that the manufacturers were making were not going into stock.    They seemed to be moving.    That was the condition of the home market.     The reports we were getting from abroad rather led us to believe that a similar state of affairs obtained in Belgium, Holland, Germany and,  to a slightly lesser extent, in France and Italy and, of course in America, - the volume of the trade there was gigantic and rapidly increasing.   We still found that in the overseas markets foreign competition was pretty keen, but customers who demanded specialities tended, it had been found, to come to this country.    The Indian market was distinctly more cheerful than it had been, and we found that prices there had a tendenoy to harden.    The Chinese market was beginning to make enquiries again and take an interest. Japan was a dead letter.    But of the overseas markets Australia was as bright as any.CHEMICALS.MR. HILL was able to report a general steadiness of the trade both in values and in volume of business, without any special feature.    On the import side, the importations of sodium nitrate were- far ahead of the 1926 figures, - a matter of interest in view of the increased production of Bynthetio nitrate for fertilisers.      On the export side, heavy cheuioals generally have held their position satisfactorily.A matter should be mentioned in connection with the extensions to the Alkali etc. Works Regulation Act, which it was proposed to make under* the Publio Health (Smoke Abatement) Act.   These amendments, if agreed upon, would oover a number of chemical manufacturers additional to those affected by the original Aotj and while there was no disagreement with the general principles of the extensions, some of the details required careful consideration.   It was right to acknowledge the help that had been given by the Ministry of Health in this matter to chemical
CHEMICALS  (OOHTJ.).manufacturers.    Another point to be mentioned was one relating to the new field of bio-chemical products, a olass of substances whioh included animal gland extracts such as insulin.    This new field of chemical industry was threatening in importance the group cf synthetic remedies that had held sway now for two generations.   This country was leading the world in the new field, and the work which had been successfully carried out at the National Institute of jiedical Research,  and the Lister Institute, on vitamins had been translated into industrial language by the British fine chemical manufacturers, so thrit now synthetic vitamin D. made by the irradiation with ultra-violet light of a substance called ergostsrol wa3 now produced on a large scale and was available commercially.    Thi3 country was first in this important field, and the matter was of obvious significance if one considered the enormous prevalence of rickets and the absence of sunshine in this country.    Vitamin D, was also available for the margarine makers, who could bring their product up to the standard of butter.    It was available for the ohocolate manufacturers and so forth; and whilst the Germans were almost feverishly anxious at our heels, and had sent over two deputations recently about It, it was of interest to know that this country was leading the way.POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS wrote:-&quot;During the month of August trade in all sections of Pottery was very slack with a slight improvement towards the latter end of the month.    Annual holidays will account for some of tho unemployment.   This improvement continued throughout September particularly in the general earthenware trade.    Exports are maintained at a good level.&quot;The home trade will be fairly good for the next two months, which is generally expected to fulfil Christmas orders.&quot;For some reason of which I am not aware, the sanitary earthenware, particularly cane and white, has suddenly fallen off, although I am informed it was expected.    One factory has shut down temporarily while others have gone on shorter time.&quot;The stoneware trade in Scotland is not doing very well and the English trade is only fair.    The unemployment figures for September are relatively low.&quot;FOOjJ INDUSTRIES.SIR STANLEY MAOHIN thought that the Food Industries would not giv3 any improvement to the general outlook.    He had recently obtained the views of the heads of three of the
POOD INDUSTRIES  (OONTD.).largest, retail distributing organisations in this oountry, and thoy all agreed that the past few months had been the most unsatisfactory they could remember:  in fact one of the Deputy Chairmen of those concerns stated that the purchasing power of the public seemed to have been reduced to an enormous extent.    It was perfectly evident from these reports that people were not spending money on food to the same extent as in previous years.     Now. however, a rush of orders appeared to be coming from the retailors; and it looked as if, owing to this lack of oonfidenoe and slackness of trade, buyers had postponed their season&apos;s purchases until a late date when, as was well known,  it was exceedingly difficult for manufacturers to overtake arrears. Also in some of the bigger merchant businesses, in sugar particularly, competition was such that business was noc being done with any kind of real profit.    The sugar position was being very much affected by the unstable conditions existing in Cuba. The Government there had been given exceptional facilities and exceptional powers, but nobody knew what was going to happen and just now the sugar market was in a state of flux.    Nobody would touch it if they could help it.Turning to the export trade, in Canada things were fairly normal; as to China, wo both imported and exported in spits of the chaotic conditions of affairs; our formerly important market in France had ceased to exiso   except for one or two specialities.    Belgium was almost stopped.    In Holland things were moving fairly well; and in the Empire the one bright spot was India, where purchasing power seemed to be increasing, and we had never had such a favourable outlook as there was at the present time.GENERAL TRADE.LORD GAINFORD desired to say generally, on behalf of the Federation of British Industries,  that some features were reported to them in connection with the general trade of the country which on the whole were satisfactory, but side by side with those features was an extraordinary depression in certain basio trades in competition with the foreigner and especially with the Continent of Europe.    The tariff barriers on British goods had much increased; and the cost of railway carriage in this country, the high rates, and also the taxes, were influences over which industry had little or no control at the present time, and were producing great depression in certain of our basic trades where we looked for real productivo wealth for the benefit of the nation.    But there was also a certain expansion in other industries.     The manufacture of motor-cars was steadily increasing, the artificial silk industries were developing, wireless apparatus in various directions and electrical engineering were expanding, together with a large number and variety of other occupations.    It was also understood that the boot and shoe industry was increasing and making fair profits.
GgNERAL TRADE  (CONTP) .ER. VYLE said that his report was like the weather, rather dull with sunny intervals.    The brightest part was really that, during the last month or two, many great contracts had been pieced at home insteed of 8broad.   The total trade,  if we compared it with 1925, was not very encouraging.    The Hull seed-crushing trade had been, disappointing.    On the other hand the fish trade was good, , all the vessels had been in commission from the Humber, which was very different from the reports of some time ago when many of the fishing boats were laid up owing to the price of coal.    On the Mersey the timber trade was remarkably good, with abnormal supplies, and the congestion at Garston docks was greater than it had been for the last five or six years. The Liverpool meat trade was in good condition.      In the Leicester boot and shoe business conditions were better, but not up to the average- for this season of the year.    On the other hand in the south of Scotland reports stated that trade generally was more satisfactory than it had been of late. Many of the Mills were exceptionally well off for work, and skilled labour was, as a rule, fully employed *MR. HCLLAip MARTIN said he wes afral$ he could not see any prosperity to report in any direction.    It had been stated more than once at that meeting that trade was bad and any profits which were being made were smell.    It was true that some of the smaller trades were beginning to make some profits and to feel a little more hopeful, but tne heavier trades were still very much involved, and undoubtedly the bankers would have to help them very considerably further*   At the present moment the banks had a very large percentage of loans outstand-ing, and undoubtedly more help would be Required in many directions if trade began to get going again.   But it looked like going very slowly for some little time.MR, BRAND endorsed what Mr. Holland Martin&apos; had said, that the outlook was certainly not for cheap money.    The-; exchange was remarkably fair for this time of year.   That wes due, probably, to a considerable extent to the enormous borrowings of other countries,  including the Dominions, in the United States.    Our bank figures here, as well as our balance of trade,  certainly did not point to any cheaper money conditions.    There were plenty of foreign borrowers who were anxious to come to London to get money.    Of course London would be protected to a certain extent by the fact that rates were so considerably cheaper for short money and long-dated money in New York.&quot; New York could now generally bid foreign borrowers a price which London could not get near.

In America money was quite cheap but it did not look as if their money was going to become still cheaper, because there was a good deal of speculation about, and it was unlikely that the Federal Reserve Bank would facilitate that.    An American banker was reported as saying that four-fifths of the total loan investments of all the member banks, - that is, of the banks reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank, a large proportion of the banks in America - represented transactions in securities, so that the amount of commercial credit was quite small compared with the loans against securities.    As far as could be Been there was a little less industrial activity   in America than there had been.    Gold continued to flow in although they had lost a little lately to the Argentine who had been importing gold as a basis for their gold standard.        In Germany conditions appoared\to be in some respects rather like ours. There was an internal boom in certain home trades but they appeared to find great difficulty as regards export trade. Their balance of trade was very adverse and home commercial requirements, credit requirements, had grown a great deal, with the consequence that money was becoming more tight.    The Reiohsbank had increased its rate yesterday; the Government expenditure was rapidly growing; it was believed that an enormous additional sum might be required for salaries of Government officials which they had just increased;  and certainly the condition in Germany did not appear to be favourable or sat isf satisfactory.,    They were still borrowing heavily abroad, and what with increased Dawes payments and their adverse balance, their position looked almost deadly.In France money was cheap.    The Bank of France continued to hold enormous surcs abroad and had great control, if it liked to exercise it, over the London market.    In Holland rates were slightly dearer and foreign issues there had not been so satisfactory.Retail Trade.HR. DEBENHAM stated that an agreement had now been reached between most of the principal stores to furnish figures indicating how the consumption of retail articles by the British public was being maintained from time to tmo. These returns would probably be half-yearly.    The Stores did not take their sales out month by month or even quarterly.    Some of them had viewed the proposal with some suspicion, and would have to be assured that secrecy could be guaranteed.
GFN3RAL TRAPS (CONTP.)Retail Trade  (Contd.)It v/as suggested that they should each have a code number, and that some official at the Board should be responsible for receiving the figures from them; that the total figure should be given to the Council, and that the  several Store should be allowed to have a copy of the return.Mr. Debenham gathered that retail trade for the first three months of the half year was considerably ahead of the corresponding period In the year before.   Some people thought the increase v/as .as high as ten per cent, among the big stores.   Then with regard to the second three months, that period v/as equally well ahBad of the same period in the year before the strike.   The wholesale business was perhaps as much behind as the retail business v/as ahead.    That might.be due largely to the fact that, owing to greater stability of fashions, there was an increasing tendency for manufacturers to trade direct with the retailer.   A section of business that was particularly bad was the silks, and that was really quite serious.Co-operative Wholesale Society.MR. HAYHURST wrote&quot; Grocery and Provisions .    Sales during the past month have been eminently satisfactory.   It is also very gratifying to record that over a period of three months, sales in practically every section of Grocery, Provision and Drapery, have increased very substantially, a feature which, to my mind, indicates the progressive side of the country&apos;s trade generally.w Sugar.   Another move towards the predicted lower level of prices has recently taken place, when the old established British refiners reduced their lists by 6d. per cwt.   No particular change has taken place in other sugars .&quot;Wheat.   Reports received during the past v;eek or so indicate that the market is practically unchanged, with a rather better demand.   Good supplies of U.S.A. wheat have been available, the receipts being heavier than last year. Flour prices v/ere reduced slightly during the past week, and an easier tone novv obtains.&quot;Drapery and Allied Trades.   Sales in every section have been very satisfactory.   He cent special autumn sales reveal substantial increases over the receipts of last -year&apos;s sales.    This is a very pleasing feature indeed.&quot;Boots, Shoes, Furnishing,, etc.   I have nothing special to report in these sections,&quot; trade being of a satisfactory and increasing character.
GsS ERAL TRADE (CCSTD).Co-operative wholesale Society (Contd).&quot;Tea.   There hes  been little change to report on the hardening prices.    Quotations have been firm ell round., notwithstanding that large auctions have been taking place.    Quality continues good, and there is little common tea coming forward at the time of this report.    Scarcely any tea is obtainable under ls.5d. per lb.   The new season^ crop, especial^ Assams, is the finest that has been seen on the market for some time.    Sales continue to increase and are obviously in advance and out of ratio to the increase in population, which means that there is an increased national consumption per head of tea.    Compared to pre-war, the consumption of tea has  doubled.   The fact that matters in the tea position is the likely shortage of crop from Northern India, which - should it eventuate -will make prices hard for a season, because Northern India supplies one half cf the tea for the world&apos;s demands.&quot;Chocolates.   The home trade is beginning to pull together to supply the demand at this time of the year for Christmas.    From enquiries it would seem that the managers at home are looking for a bumper record.&quot;

RAILWAY TPAFFIC.MR. HILL reported that the latest figures of railway reoeipts for the year, up to the 25th September last,  in the four railway groups showed an excess of  856,000 over the corresponding period for 1925;  but,  taking the last twelve weeks of that period, the corresponding receipts were  435,000 less than in 1925.    Passenger receipts,  of course, continued to show a very great failing off, but, if the passenger receipts were ignored, a comparison with 1925 in respect of merchandise,  excluding coal, showed an increase of about three and a quarter millions in the full period up to 25th September,  and about  829,000 in the last twelve weeks of the period.    Similarly for the coal trade, receipts had increased in the full period by  1,841,000 and in the last twelve weeks by  629,000.The latest monthly railway statistics available were those for July.    As far as passenger traffic was concerned, except in the case of journeys taken by excursion and week-end fares, the falling off continued.    But a greater number of excursion and week-end tickets were issued during July than in any month since the end of the war.    Unfortunately that did not counterbalance the falling off in other kinds of passenger traffic.    As regards freight train traffic,  in July there was a very heavy falling off - in coal as compared with 1925, amounting to over two million tons, that is about 11/ to 12 .    Of course in July 1925 there had been very heavy coal traffic owing&apos;to an anticipated strike.    There wa.s also some falling off in the tonnage of general merchandise during last July; but,  taking the seven months to the end of July as a whole,  the tonnage of all freight traffic showed an increase of 3,458,000 tons or I.87C over that of 1925.    Among the particular traffics, the only items of which we had information which showed any considerable increase, were iron and steel and iron stone and iron ore.    Iron stone and iron ore showed an increase for the month of July of this year of 23&apos;/;. over July of 1925.EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS observed that the unemployment total on the 26th September was 1,058,800.    It had not varied very much from that figure since the beginning of July, apart from the temporary rise round August Bank Holiday.    The number of wholly unemployed, taken separately, had shown a gradual increase ever since the beginning of June.    This might reflect a seasonal decline in employment, but having regard to the time of year, the fact that the total remained fairly constant seemed to indicate that the normal seasonal decline was being counterbalanced by a slight general improvement.
AUSTRALIAN   TRADE.MR. SANDERSON reported that the last few months had been an anxious time in Australia owing to the want of rain, and although they had had a little during the last ten days or fortnight, not nearly enough had fallen yet to relieve their needs.    In consequence, the pastoral Industry was in a rather difficult position.    The States most affected were Queensland and New South IVales; and perhaps the least affeoted was Western Australia.    The actual decrease in the wool clip for this year was estimated at from about 250,000 to 400,000 bales, but those estimates were always very difficult to check.     The other serious . thing was that although the lambing in many places   had been fair and good, the lambs were dying off owing to want of green food, with the result that next year&apos;s clip would be considerably prejudiced.    Another difficulty was in connection with the sale of sheep.     There had been a failure to send sheep to New South .7ales from Queensland, and accordingly the diminished numbers of stock in New South &apos;7ales were the cause of a good deal of concern, affecting the question of next year1a clip.   That position was reflected in&apos; the general industrial and oommeroial activities in Australia, so that just at the immediate present the outlook was anything but favourable.In wheat, the position would depend to some extent on the next few weekB, but, speaking generally, the prospects appeared to be reasonably good.    As to dried fruits, serious frosts had occurred in the Hurray River country, and although it was very difficult to say to what extent the damage might be repaired if the present favourable weather continued, it seemed clear that at least half of the production would be lost.   With reference to the mining industry, owing to the drop in the price of lead and increases in costs,  the Broken Hill Proprietary Company had had to close down in Broken Hill, although It still kept its iron and steel works going in Newcastle.The Commonwealth Government had decided to share with the Empire iviarketing Board the capital and annual contribution towards the cost of establishing and maintaining a research institute for tropical agriculture.    A great deal of attention had recently been drawn to the necessity for scientific research, and at the present time, amongst wool growers particularly, an attempt was being made to raise  200,000 to establish pastoral research on a satisfactory footing.Tbe Commonwealth Bank had opened an agency in New York, which was rather a remarkable step to take from Australia&apos;s point of view, but it seemed an indispensable one.    Some conoern had been expressed as to what it really meant, but it was an actual fact now.
INDIAN   TRflJ E,iitv. LINuSAY considered that thero wero indications that India waB able to pin-chase more than she had been able to do during the last year or two.   Talcing the four months from April to July, the imports   of foreign goods into India had gone up from 71 crores during those four months in 1925 to 77 or ore s in 1926 and 79 crores in 19 27, and that advance undoubtedly showed a very material increase in quantities considering the fall in prices,    un iron and steel goods, in particular, India had spent during the four months, April to July, 5 crores in 19 25, 6 crores in 1926, 7 crores in 1927, and it was believed that during the last month or two the effect of the revised duties on iron and steel goods had been that both the quantities of British goods and the percentage of British goods imported, were increasing.As regards ootton, the Legislative Assembly had agreed to a specif ic duty of 1-g- annas per lb. on imported yarns as an alternative to the present 5% ad valorem duty.   Whichever duty produoed the highest revenue was to be applied. Working out these duties in application to the imports of 1926/27, It had been found that the Japanese yarn trade, supposing these duties had applied then, would have had to pay an additional half anna per lb., and the Manchester yarn trade would have had to pay an additional quarter anna per lb. respectively, on exports to India.    It seemed, therefore, that Japan was going to suffer.    The Japanese manufacturers had already started complaining about these duties.   Of course the imports of yarn into India were a very small proportion of her total consumption; they amounted to 50 million pounds as against a total output of 800 million pounds.    The corollary was, how were these duties fPing to affect India&apos;s consumption of piece goods, for it was probable that the raw material, at any rate coarse yarns, would have to be marked at higher prices.    Probably those concerns in India which were working on a vertical basis would be able to carry on business, perhaps    on better lines than before, but the concerns which were interested only in spinning might find some difficulty in soiling their yarn to weaving conoerns, and these,  in their turn, might have difficulty in selling the finished goods of which the raw material had been increased in price.   The report of the Indian Tariff Board was very interesting as showing that Bombay was Buffering not merely from the competition of Japan, but also, and more particularly, from the competition of the up-country mills in India.    In fact, the industry which really was the making of Bombay seemed now to be strangled by the growth of the City of Bombay Itself.    Sir William Clare Lees had referred to the depression in the grey section of the cotton trade, though not in connexion with India particularly. India was, however, consuming a Bmaller proportion of greys to her total consumption of piece goods.    Taking the total imports of piece goods into India at 16, the pre-war proportion were   8 grey, 4 white, and 4 coloured.    The proportion worked out nowadays at only 7 grey   to 5 white and 4 coloured.
MR . HOSE wrote&quot;There has occurred in Argentine an event of extreme Importance in the economic development of the country. Operating by decree, the Government of the Republic announced on 26th August last thst the Csja de Conversion would thence-forvard re-open for the withdrawal of gold against deposits of paper currency.   Under the Conversion Law of 4th November, 1899, the Ca,1a de Conversion was authorised to issue and deliver on demand paper pesos for gold coin in the proportion of one paper peso for 44 gold cents, and vice versa, but, in August, 1914, the delivery of gold against paper was suspended. By the resumption of such operations, Argentina has made a full return to the gold standard of currency, a step which may be regarded as a normal outcome of the economic progress of the Republic in recent years.&quot;The official returns of Argentine foreign trade for the first six months of 1927 show that imports amounted in value to $394,247,766 (gold), while exports totalled $563,902,469, so that there was established a visible surplus of exports amounting to $169 , 654,703, which compares with a favourable trade balance of only $19,165,981 for the first six months of 1926.   Moreover, exports of cereals continue to take place on a very heavy scale for the season of the year, and, in general, the business situation has improved.   The receipt of funds in payment for the large exports is naturally finding reflection in increased pur-chases of imported goods, while, even in the textile trade -which suffered most severely during the recent trade depression - recovery is no// in progress.&quot;The exceptionally favourable harvest this year has been of considerable benefit to the country as a whole, and especially to the.railway companies, whose results for the past twelve months have been most satisfactory.   Earlier in the year, export conditions were such that exchange rose to above gold parity in June last, and this movement gave rise to conjectures that a further sharp advance might occur. Special shipments of gold, however, were arranged from South Africa, and also to a smaller extent from London, which obviated any further vory marked appreciation in the value of the peso.   Argentina was recently successful in arranging a loan of $40,000,000 In New York for the purpose of funding the floating debt of the State Railways, and part of the proceeds of this Issue have also been trans-raitted to Buenos Aires in gold.   With the re-opening of the Conversion Office,  exchange will remain steady between the gold import and export points.   This effective stabilisation, of exchange should, of course, prove    of very great benefit in Argentina&apos;s future development.&quot;In Chile, the nitrate situation has undergone a distinct change for the better.    The number of nitrate oficinas in operation continues to increase, and many workmen have returned to the nitrate areas.   Sales of nitrate of soda under the free-selling system have con-tinued to take place on a large scale, the amount disposed of during the period 14th April to 15th September last having been as much as 1,745,327 metric tons, - and is now believed to amount to nearly 2,000,000 tons, -which figure compares with 2,149,178 metric tons sold duringSOUTH AMERICAN TRADE .
CONFnWITlAL.310SOUTH AMeiRICAa TRADjj (CONTD) .the whole cf the nitrate year July, 1925. to June, 1926.    It would appear thet, in more then one of the consuming countries, the growing disposition observable in recent years to experiment with the use of synthetic fertilisers Is now civing place to a definite preference - even in Germany, the home of synthetic nitrates- for the natural product. Moreover,  insufficient fertilisation with nitrate in the cotton growing areas cf the United States last Spring adversely affected the crops, and a determination to remedy the omission next year has induced forward buying on an unprecedented scale.   The increased industrial activity has not yet exercised any very appreciable influence on Chilean trade conditions, but merchants will be better able to normalise their posit ions as work is commenced at more of the oficinas.&quot;Trade conditions in Bras II continue dull, and the situation in the textile industry in Sao Paulo is again causing anxiety, stocks having accumulated to a considerable extent, while sales to the Interior h8ve fallen off.     On .the other hand, agreement has been reached between the various States signatory to the Coffee Convention, and regulations have been drawn up for the limitation of stocks of coffee and of entries into ports of shipment.   It is also understood that a credit of  5,000,000 has been granted to the Coffee Institute, to be employed in making. a dvances against railway bills of lading In connection with the movement of coffee.&quot;In Peru, the situation in regard to the cotton crop appears to be satisfactory.    Local prices for the staple have shown a considerable advance, and growers should be able to offset to some effent the poor returns of last year&apos;s harvest, even if there should be   nc further rise in prices.   A better tone has also developed in the Peruvian sugar market,  owing to a steady enquiry from Europe.    In general, the trade situation would appear to have  improved,  end representatives of foreign firms are receiving orders for all classes cf goods for delivery after 31st December next, when certain special Customs surcharges will be withdrawn.    It  is understood that the new tariff, which h8s already been drawn up by the Government, while being on a higher basis than that existing last year, will be lower than that now in force.    Stocks held by local traders appear to be considerably depleted,  owing to their reluctance to place orders while the present high duties remain in force, and the proposed new tariff may have a beneficial effect on. trade,.    In the circumstances, it is regrettable that there was passed in December last a law for the imposition cf direct taxation on profits, especially as the extensive undeveloped resources cf the country oall for an uninterrupted influx of capital from abroad.&quot;In regard to the general situation in the Central American countries, it may be recalled that the recommendations of the Kemmerar Commission, which investigated the position of the national finances of Ecuador, included a proposal for the creation of a Central Bank of Issue.   This recommendation has
SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE  (CONTP) .now bean acted upon, and the Banco Central del Ecuador commenced operations on 10th August last.   The trade situation in the Republic shows little improvement, there being still a considerable degree of credit stringency, but the stabilisation of exchange, and the co-ordination of banking business arising from the establishment of the central bank, form a sound basis for future trade development.&quot;The cessation of hostilities between the opposing political parties in Nicaragua has been followed bv an increase in business activity, while the improvement in general conditions has been accentuated by the excellent outlook for the coming coffee crop.   A return to normal commercial conditions in the near future can hardly be expected, but there is every possibility of a gradual recovery during the coffee harvest and expert season.&quot;
