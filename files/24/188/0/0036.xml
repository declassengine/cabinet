238Printed for the Cabinet, October, 1927.SECRET. -- -    -OorY No. 3 0CP. 237 (27).THE CABINET.RE-ALLOCATION OF DUTIES BETWEEN THE QUARTER-MASTER-GENERAL AND THE MASTER-GENERAL OF THE ORDNANCE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.As there has been considerable criticism in the public Press based upon letters to The Times, chiefly from former Quartermasters-General and Supply Officers and some others, concerning the proposed changes in the duties of the Quartermaster-General and the Master-General of the Ordnance, I hope my colleagues will read the following short statement of the reasons for the change and give me their support.Reasons fob Change.1. The necessity for changes in the functions of the Quartermaster-General and the Master-General of the Ordnance and of the Royal Army Service Corps and the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, if not of the Royal Engineers as well, is generally accepted by everyone who has followed the development of mechanization. Formerly there were only a few mechanical vehicles in the Army besides those belonging to Royal Army Service Corps units, and it was fairly logical that this corps should maintain them, especially as they were mostly of similar type to those used by the Royal Army Service Corps.2. With the introduction of tanks, armoured cars, dragons, self-propelled guns, half-track, wheel-cum-track and six-wheeled vehicles, the situation rapidly became complicated. The division between transport vehicles and technical vehicles, track and wheeled, became impossible. Even if an arbitrary division could be maintained, it was obvious that the whole progress of mechanization would be held up so long as the Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for developing one type of cross-country vehicle and the Quartermaster-General another. In practice it is impossible for the General Staff at home or the authorities in India to decide between the conflicting claims of these departments as to the respective merits of their vehicles for certain requirements.3. In the War Office the Royal Army Service Corps under the Quartermaster-General provided and repaired all wheeled, load and passenger-carrying Mechanical Transport vehicles while the Master-General of the Ordnance produced tanks, dragons, all tracked vehicles and Mechanical Transport vehicles peculiar to fighting units. These were, however, repaired by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps acting under the Quarter-master-General, with spare parts which the Master-General of the Ordnance was required to provide. The Master-General of the Ordnance did, however, carry out &quot; factory repair,&quot; when the Royal Army Ordnance Corps under the Quartermaster-General decided it was necessary. Quite apart from the administrative disadvantage of separating renair from experiment, design and production in the &quot;case of semi-experimental vehicles like tanks, the mere fact of providing a vehicle with a weapon, or arniour, or even a special body, seemed sufficient to remove it from the sphere of the Royal Army Service Corps. The Master-General of the Ordnance would thus be responsible for fitting the weapons, armour, &amp;c, and the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, under the Quartermaster-General, would thenceforth maintain and repair it, though all the repairs might be to an engine for which the Royal Army Service Corps held stocks of spares.4. As regards workshops, there were the Royal Engineer workshops, the M.G.O.&apos;s workshops, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps workshops (under the Quartermaster-General) and the Royal Army Service Corps workshops (under the Quartermaster-General) ; of these the last three are, or may be, engaged on very similar work.(B27/18)   100   10/27   W.O.P.   3290
&quot;5. In units the situation &quot;was even more serious&quot;; mo3t mechanized or partly-mechanized units possessed both wheeled and tracked vehicles and had therefore to be followed about by two mobile repair workshops ; the Royal Army Service Corps to repair the former and the Royal Army Ordnance. Corps the latter. This has actually been happening recently to quite small units like anti-aircraft brigades, Royal Artiilery, proceeding to practice camp.6. The difficulties were not, however, confined to vehicles, and it was found very difficult indeed to maintain a clear distinction between warlike stores produced by the Master-General of the Ordnance and other stores produced by the Quartermaster-General ; in many cases the distinction was purely arbitrary and bordering on the ludicrous.Procedure Adopted.In 1923 the Weir Committee which was a Sub-Committee ot the Cabinet Committee on Expenditure under the Chairmanship of Lord Weir, Considered the question. Its members were Lieut.-General Sir Herbert Miles, Sir Russell Scott of the Treasury and Sir John Chancellor, representing the Committee of Imperial Defence. Their recommendations may be summarized as follows : (a) All vehicles using internal combustion engines should be dealt with by one authority. The design, production and inspection of all mechanical transport vehicles should be transferred to the department of the Master-General of the Ordnance.   (Paragraph 66.)(ft) The Master-General of the Ordnance in staffing his branches for mechanical transport, tractors, &amp;c, should make increasing use of the officers of the Royal Engineers.   (Paragraph 68.)(c) The Master-General of the Ordnance should be specifically charged with the responsibility for ensuring the scientific development of all material, and should keep in close and constant touch with the General Staff, to ensure that the tactical aspect of every form of weapon is given full consideration. (Paragraphs 72 to 75.)The Weir Report was considered in the War Office, but no agreement could be come to which was acceptable to both the Quartermaster-General and the Master-General of the Ordnance, and a compromise was reached under which the Quartermaster-General is solely responsible for all wheeled load and passenger carrying mechanical vehicles, whereas the Master-General of the Ordnance is responsible for the design and production of track vehicles, although the repairs, even of track vehicles designed and produced by the Master-General of the Ordnance, are done by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps under the orders of the Quartermaster-General.In 1926, on the advent of a new Chief of the Imperial General Staff, I asked him to consider the matter, and he strongly endorsed the recommendations of the Weir &apos;Committee as being essential to facilitate further development of mechanization. After a further departmental examination, the matter came before the Army Council in July, 1926, when it became apparent that any re-allocatinn of duties in peace would react On &quot;the Organization for war, and that the two questions ought to be considered together. I &quot;again referred the matter back to the members of the Army Council for further examination in their respective departments, and the results of this examination made it clear that there could be no agreement by the then Quartermaster-General upon ariy alteration which withdrew from the Royal Army Service Corps the provision and maintenance of the load and passenger carrying mechanical vehicles.On 26th November, 1926, the Army Council formulated some provisional decisions for the purpose of being advised by a Committee representing the departments concerned, of the nature arid extent of the alterations in present organization which would result. The Committee which reported in May, 1927, failed to reach a complete agreement.I referred &quot;this report to the Military Members of the Army Council and &apos;l!he Permanent Under Secretary, and I received their advice in June, 1927.I approved the course they advised, and my decision was recorded at a meeting of the Army Council in June, 1927.
Nature of the Changes. In the field.     ,%In the field the Master-General of the Ordnance will be represented in war by a Deputy at General Headquarters.The Objections raised to this change are : firstly, that the duties of providing and repairing mechanical vehicles ought not to be taken from the Royal Army Service Corps ; secondly, that if maintenance and movement are taken from the sole control of the Quartermaster-General, there will be confusion or breakdown ; thirdly, that there should not be four Chief Staff Officers at General Headquarters ; and fourthly, that the Deputy Master-General of the Ordnance was not required at General Headquarters in the Great War.As regards the first objection, these duties will remain with the Royal Army Service Corps in respect of all vehicles on the establishment of that Corps.The answers to the other objections which are capable of great elaboration, appear to be that if four Chief Staff Officers at General Headquarters are proved to be too many, the proposals do not prevent their being reduced to two, i.e., a Chief of the General Staff and a Chief of Administration under whom the duties of the deputies of the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General and the Master-General of the Ordnance could be co-ordinated. Such eo-ordination would also reassure some who find the functions of &quot; maintenance &quot; and &quot; movement&quot; are inseparable.I think it may well depend upon the nature and extent of the Avar which organization should be adopted ; if it is a European war with Allies, the two Chief Staff officer plan would, I think, be better, but if the war is one on the Indian frontier, it may be possible for the Chief of the General Staff to do any co-ordination necessary in the work of the three Administrative Staff Officers. My advisers, however, prefer that a Deputy Master-General of the Ordnance should be added to the Staff and that the Chief of the General Staff shall co-ordinate the work of the Staff, as piwided by the revised Field Service Regulations. Moreover, the appointment of a Deputy Master-General of the Ordnance will obviate the necessity for affiliating to the General Staff a senior officer of each of the technical arms (e.g., Artillery, Engineers, Tank Corps, &amp;c), to advise on questions of material, as provided by the existing Field Service Regulations.Opinions will always differ as to whether the ammunition supply and the development of new weapons from tanks to trench mortars would not have been quicker and better if there had been a Deputy Master-General of the Ordnance responsible at General Headquarters during the early part of the Great War. 1 was at the Ministry of Munitions in 1916-17, and I know the difficulty we had in obtaining any accurate figures of requirements ; no one individual had the information. The duties of a Deputy Master-General of the Ordnance were done in part by several officers often communicating direct with the supplying authorities, and gaps in our information were frequently filled by intelligent guesses made after visits to General Headquarters, a possibility when General Headquarters is distant but a few hours, but not to be relied upon to replace a proper organization in a war, with a far distant General Headquarters.-It was not until 1918 when an officer of the Staff at General Headquarters assumed most of the duties and functions of a Deputy Master-General of the Ordnance that reliable information was forthcoming.From another point of view there is no doubt that the recommendation of the Weir Committee in paragraph 3 (c) of this memorandum touches a very vital point of modern military organization. In the opinion of my advisers it is of the utmost importance that -the commander-in-chief in the next war shall have the best expert advice available on the tactical aspect of modern inventions of every kind. This can be given only by officers who have spent some years studying the broader aspect of these questions in the department of the Master-General of the Ordnance at the War Office, and is not a question of administration at all. They consider that the lessons of the Great War respecting the adoption of tanks, trench mortars, gas and other inventions for use in the field fully justifj&apos; this conclusion.It is not intended that officers to represent the Master-General of the Ordnance should be added to the staffs of the Armies, Corps or Divisions.At the War Office.At the War Office the Master-General of the Ordnance will in future be responsible for all duties, viz., research, experiment, design, inspection, provision, storage, issue and repair of all track, semi-track and wheeled mechanical vehicles, except that vehicles on the establishment of the Royal Army Service Corps will be provided and maintained by them under specification approved by the Master-General of the Ordnance.
The Ordnance Corps in future will come under the Master-General of the Ordnance instead of the Quartermaster-General. As it has been suggested that the separation of custody and issue of stores frorn movement will lead to difficulties, it should be understood that the bulk of the stores to be carried in the field consists of fuel, petrol, forage and supplies, all of which will still be dealt with entirely by the Quartermaster-General.The principle which has been followed in the new organization is to keep as far as possible under one head both the production and maintenance of all &quot; ordnance &quot; stores. This is considered to be more important than the keeping together of maintenance (as regards stores) and movement. The complexity and rapid evolution of warlike and other stores had rendered it essential that those who design and produce should also be in the closest touch with those who inspect, repair and use. It is only in this way that the requirements of the troops can best be met and the development of modern science be applied to the best advantage in the field.The Ordnance Corps is not, as is often supposed, a branch of the Royal Artillery, but is open to officers of all arms, and the officers charged with the maintenance of tanks, dragons, &amp;c, are fully qualified mechanical engineers obtained by direct entry.This concentration will, I believe, lead to economy in the provision of workshops and mobile repair vehicles, and in the personnel.The Royal Army Service Corps has amongst its officers many experts who have rendered distinguished service in the. provision of mechanical transport and who are entitled to the credit for much of the progress made in the Army, and it is not the fact that the knowledge and experience already gained will be lost to the service, or that officers of the Royal Army Service Corps who have specialized in mechanical engineering, will in future have restricted opportunities for employment ; on the contrary, in the reorganization appointments under the Master-General of the Ordnance will be filled by those best qualified, independently of tlie Corps to which they may happen to belong. Officers of the Royal Army Service Corps will therefore in future have two avenues of advancement instead of one as at present. It is not the intention that these appointments should go to officers of any one arm, but to those officers who have the most suitable technical qualifications for the work required.I hope full use^will be made of the special knowledge of the officers of the Royal Army Service Corps and that also it will be found possible in time to utilize Royal Engineer officers as recommended by the Weir Committee ; at present, after expensive and extensive training at Woolwich, Chatham and Cambridge University, young Royal Engineer officers spend much of their early service in &quot; plumbing and glazing &quot;.With the certain extension of mechanical warfare and the increased substitution of machines for men, there is plenty of scope under a single responsible member of the Army Council for the services of all officers with special knowledge.In a big war it is probable that some form of Ministry of Munitions or of Supply, or some body to determine priority as between demands upon the limited supplies will be set up, and the concentration of mechanical vehicles under the Master-General of the Ordnance will assist that organization in its relations with the Army and the War Office.The Quartermaster-General who is responsible for providing accommodation for the troops, will take over all duties connected with works, and barrack construction will then come under him instead of under the Master-General of the Ordnance.It is the next war rather than the last for which my military advisers are preparing, and while there is much to justify these changes in the lessons of the past, it is a proper appreciation of modern mechanical developments which makes them essential in preparing for the wars of the future.I believe the changes are called for by the changing nature of the Army itself and that efficiency and economy will be promoted by the reorganization. I propose to put &quot;them into force without further delay.L. W.-E.7th October, 1927.
