268Printed Jor the Cabinet, October, 1927.SECRET.Copt No.   o 0CP. 245 (27).THE CABINET.RELEASE OF TRANSPORTS ON RETURN FROM CHINA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I attach a note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff recommending the release     120 of certain hired transports on their return from China. Far EastI ask for Cabinet sanction for the proposal. 616L. W.-E.ISih October, 1927.1. On 28th February, 1927, the China (Military Details) Committee of the Cabinet decided that &quot; sufficient troopships should be kept between Hong Kong and Shanghai to enable a brigade to be on the water simultaneously at short notice and at the minimum expense, and that the remainder should be dispensed with.&quot;As a result of this decision the hired transports &quot; Herminius,&quot; &quot; Karmala,&quot; and &quot; Bellerophon,&quot; and the ambulance transport &quot; Assaye &quot; were retained in China.2. On 6th July, 1927, the Cabinet agreed &quot; that the Secretary of State for War should have authority to use, for the withdrawal to India of the Indian Mixed Brigade, two of the reserve of ships retained in the Far East to facilitate the transfer of forces from one part of China to another.&quot;Hired transports &quot; Karmala &quot; and &quot; Bellerophon &quot; were used for this purpose.3. On 25th August, 1927, the Cabinet agreed &quot; That, having regard to the changed situation in China and more particularly to the disappearance, for the present, at any rate, of any imminent probability of the occupation of Tientsin and Peking by the Nationalist forces, the proposal of the Secretary of State for War that the s.s. &quot; Herminius &quot; should be used for the conveyance of the troops to be withdrawn should be approved, notwith-standing that this would leave only one transport (viz., s.s. &quot;Assaye,&quot; capable of transporting approximately one battalion at a tune) immediately available for the transport of troops from one part of China to another.&quot;4. The hired transport &quot; Herminius&quot; is due at London on 20th October, 1927, and the hired transports &quot; Karmala &quot; and &quot; Bellerophon &quot; are due to arrive about the end of November and the end of December respectively, carrying reservists and units withdrawn from China.These ships will not be required for the further evacuation of the troops from China now under orders to return home.5. We now have, and can retain in Chinese waters, the s.s. &quot; Assaye,&quot; which is capable of transporting approximately one battalion. In addition we can use local shipping should the necessity arise. This should suffice to meet any requirements for troop movements in China that can at present be foreseen.I therefore recommend that the hired transports &quot; Herminius,&quot; &quot;Karmala &quot; and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; should be handed back to their owners on arrival in England. Cabinet authority is required. .The matter is urgent in the case of hired transport &quot; Herminius,&quot; since the cost of retaining the vessel after completion of discharge is between  400 and  500 per day.October, 1927.(b27/17)   100   10/27   w.o.p.  3310
