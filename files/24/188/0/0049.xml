They recommend thot the British battalion should remain,  and that, if reinforcements are required in the event of war, these should consist in tho first instance of a unit of the -Royal Air Force as the most mobile arm.      They axe not convinced that any substantial economi.03 would result from tho substitution of an air squadron for an infantry battalion.     The maximum reduction to which they would essent is one company of infantry, and one troop of the &quot;Aden Troop&quot;&apos;.The Chief of the Air Sbr.ff considers that the substitution of an air squadron,  combined with a force of native levies, for a British battalion will materially increase the security of Aden against sea-borne attackt land attack and air attack, thus simplifying the problem of internal security,.He holds that, in normal times, the proposed substitution would lead to a considerable measure of economy, and that, owing to the prevention of encroachment, and the assistance afforded in the administration of the Protectrr&amp;te, adverse complications, necessitating a temporary increase of garrison, will be easier to avoid.&quot;(5.) If the Committee of Imperial Defence wish to pursue the matter further, we recommend that an Expert Committee should be set up to examine the financial aspects of the proposed change, in order that the Committee of imperial -Defence may be in a position to appreciate the amount of financial saving (if any) and the degree of risk (if any) which, after consideration of our Report, thoy may think to be involved&quot;.The Committee of Imperial Defence consideredthe Report of the Chiefs of Staff Committee at its 226thMeeting, held on 5th May,  1927;    and agreed:-&quot;(a.)

I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ] Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   April 1927.SECRET. Copy No.    45151-D.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 68.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.ADEN GARRISON,Report by the Chiefs of Staff.1.   AT a meeting held on the 16th December,  1926  (Cabinet 66 (26), Conclusion 4 (c)), the Cabinet decided : That the Committee of Chiefs of Staff should be instructed that the Cabinet desire that the defence of Aden should be reduced to a less costly basis, and should be asked to advise the Committee of Imperial Defence as to whether this can be effected without undue risks by an addition at Aden of a Squadron of the Royal Air Force, combined with the a withdrawal and disbandment of the British Infantry battalion at present stationed there, or by any other means.2. We considered these instructions at meetings held on the 25th January, 1927, and 14th March, 1927, with the assistance of the Memoranda by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff, which are annexed to this Report.3. We agree unanimously that the question of the disbandment of a British battalion raises large considerations of policy, some of which are outside the scope of this Committee, and that even those aspects of the question which fall within our province, are more appropriate to an annual review of defence policy than to an examination of the local defence of Aden. We refrain therefore from making any recommendation on this point.4. We also agree that there can be no question of withdrawing the British Infantry battalion, or. indeed, of effecting any reduction in the garrison of Aden, until such time as a satisfactory agreement with the Imam has been reached.In this connection, however, we feel bound to mention that, without awaiting our Report, the Treasury have already cut down the Colonial Office Estimates for Aden from  609,000 to  509,000 (see&apos;a letter dated the 17th February, 1927, from &apos; the Controller of Supply Services, Treasury, to the Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office).5. Before coming to a point on which our views differ we wish to draw attention to the following extracts from our recent Report on the position in South-West Arabia, in which we explained the strategical importance of Aden (C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B) :-* *    .   .        * * * *&quot; 3. From the Naval point of view the security of Aden itself is vital. Aden is of great importance to the fuelling arrangements of the main Fleet when on passage to the Far East; it will be used as a naval anchorage, and possesses repair facilities capable of dealing with destroyers. In addition, it is an alternative Convoy Assembly Point, a Port of Refuge for merchant shipping, and a Route-Giving Unit. It has a powerful Wireless Station and a reserve&apos; of 108,000 tons of naval oil fuel.&quot;******&quot; 21 (5). From the military point of view, it is necessary to occupy only such portions of the Aden Protectorate as are essential to the security of the Naval base, and .... any additional commitments are liable to be a source of military embarrassment.&quot;* * * * * *
We are agreed that no steps ought to be taken to secure economy which would minimise the security of the Imperial naval interests dependent on the port.6. By reason of the conclusions recorded in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above, the problem is reduced to an examination of the means by which the defence of Aden can, ultimately and without xmdue risk, be reduced to a less costly basis.On this subject we are unable to present a unanimous Report.7. The views of the Chief of the Air Staff, as summarised in paragraph 9 of his Memorandum (Annexure (B)), are as follows : (a.) The R.A.F. squadron which is being transferred to Aden in accordance with the recent Cabinet decision, should remain there as a permanent part of the garrison, in substitution for the existing flight.(&amp;.) An irregular corps of native levies, about 400-500 strong, with British officers, to be formed as soon as can be arranged. (Existing accommoda-tion, on the small scale required, can be utilised. This measure would be in accordance with the principle applied to other British Colonies and Protectorates that local forces should be used in the defence and security of their own territory.)(c.) After the R.A.F. squadron and organisation at Aden have become established, and after a satisfactory arrangement with the Imam in regard to the Protectorate boundaries has been arrived at, the British battalion should be withdrawn.(d.) A R.A.E. squadron, if substituted for the British battalion, would have a wide scope for useful employment in peace time, and would, in conjunction with the remaining troops, not only amply fulfil internal security requirements, but would also provide a more efficient means of resisting encroachment into the Protectorate than is afforded by the present garrison.In war, the additional security achieved by this measure of substitution will be great, since aircraft can fulfil many of the general defence functions of the battalion, and numerous other duties in addition. The security of the port from land attack will be considerably increased, since-offensive action can be taken; an additional deterrent to sea-borne attack will be provided, and ample security against air attack will beavauauic.(e.) The substitution of a squadron, combined with a force of native levies, for the British battalion, would not only effect considerable economy in the recurrent cost of the garrison, but would also enable a saving in capital cost to be made, since extra accommodation for the R.A.F. unit could be constructed more cheaply than the projected new infantry barracks.(/.) On the withdrawal of the British battalion, it should prove possible to bring about additional economies in the ancillary services of the Aden garrison.The Chief of the Air Staff draws attention to the opinions expressed by the Chiefs of Staff in OLD. Paper No. 738-B. In paragraph 12 of that paper it was agreed that the existing garrison &quot; is not competent to prevent further encroachments by the Imam.&quot; If it were made more mobile, partial but not complete success in this direction might be expected.In paragraph 21 (2) it was recommended that these &apos;&apos; further encroachments might be prevented by the employment of a squadron of bombing machines stationed at Aden,&quot; it being borne in mind that the necessity may arise of increasing the garrison at Aden to meet an attack on that place consequent on Air operations against the Imam.If, as he believes, the retention of this squadron as a permanent measure in substitution for a British battalion will prevent the Imam from encroaching, not only will detriment to British prestige be avoided, but the problem of internal security of the Protectorate and of Aden itself will be rendered correspondingly easier.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, whilst claiming that a British infantry battalion is better suited than a squadron of aircraft for the defence of the land frontier and for defence against sea-borne raiding attacks, agreed that an air squadron can fulfil many functions in defence (see paragraph 7 (b) to (/), COS. Paper No. 66). This, in the opinion of the Chief of the Air Staff, constitutes a very strong reason for its presence. In the future, the menace of air attack against Aden, both shore-based from Arabia or Africa, and sea-borne, seems more likely to develop
than other forms of attack; the effect of air bombing or gas attack against military objectives or the native populace might prove very serious, and the composition of the garrison should be such as will counter this nature of enemy activity. If, however, our resources permitted, the security of Aden would undoubtedly be increased by the presence of British infantry.8. The views of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, summarised in paragraph 15 of his Memorandum (Annexure (C)) are as follows: (a.) Although aircraft has the advantage of mobility and range, it is unsuitable and cannot replace a British battalion for the purposes of the close defence of that part of the Aden Protectorate which is necessary to the security of the Naval Base.(b.) Should the British battalion be withdrawn, the. remaining Indian battalion would, on account of detachments and other protective duties, be insufficient to repel a sea-borne raid on the scale to which Aden is liable, and that aircraft is unable to repel such raid, especially if made during the hours of darkness or during misty weather.(c.) The material available for Native Levies is either unsuitable or unreliable for service in the Protectorate, and that it would be unfair to ask British officers to do duty with them, especially if there was no British Infantry as a backing.(d.) For purposes of internal security, especially in a place of the importance of Aden, it is advisable to have a leavening of British troops.(e.) The administration of the Natives with whom we are at peace can only be done by contact with them on the ground, and that to deal with incipient trouble by means of the weapons carried in aircraft is not in accordance with British ideas.(/.) It is wiser and more logical to maintain the surer form of close defence on the spot and reinforce it by that arm which can get there most quickly and economically.(g.) It is most inopportune to consider the future permanent garrison of Aden at a time when a bombing squadron is being sent there to act against the Imam offensively and when the future situation cannot be foretold.(7i.) The permanent addition of a squadron to the garrison of Aden must involve capital expenditure if the decision of the Cabinet as to the number of Home Defence Squadrons is to be adhered to, and that the decrease in cost claimed by the Air Staff on account of the substitution of a squadron for a British battalion are no savings to the British Exchequer.9. The reasons for the points of view urged by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff respectively are set forth in detail in the three Annexures to this Report.10. The Chief of the Naval Staff is concerned solely with the security of the port of Aden. While not pretending to judge the technical issues between the two methods of land defence, he holds strongly that we cannot afford to take risks at so important a point. He therefore associates himself with the recommendation of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that the British battalion should be maintained at Aden, and that, in the event of war, the garrison should be reinforced, if necessary, by a squadron of aircraft.11. We are unable to give an estimate of the cost of the garrison of Aden according as it includes a British battalion or, alternatively, a squadron of aeroplanes. The problem is an exceedingly technical one which can only be dealt with by experts. We recommend that, if the Committee of Imperial Defence wish to be further informed on this point, they should set up a technical Committee to examine it.Summary of Conclusions. 12.   Our Conclusions may be summed up as follows : (1.) The question of the disbandment of a British battalion involves some considerations outside the scope of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and in any event cannot suitably be dealt with in connection with the defence of a single port.
(2.) We are agreed that the British battalion ought not to be withdrawn untilthe difficulties with the Imam have been settled. (3.) We are agreed that economy ought not to be sought at the expense of risk to the security of the Imperial naval interests dependent on Aden. (4.) On the question of the possibility of eventually replacing the British battalion at Aden by a squadron of aeroplanes: The Chief of the Imperial General Staff considers that undue risks would be run by making the change. The Chief of the Naval Staff is unwilling to accept a risk described in this manner by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. They recommend that the British battalion should remain, and that, if reinforcements are required in the event of war, these should consist in the first instance of a unit of the Royal Air Force as the most mobile arm. They are not convinced that any substantial economies would result from the substitution of an air squadron for an infantry battalion. The maximum reduction to which they would assent is one company of infantry, and one troop of the &quot;Aden Troop.&quot;The Chief of the Air Staff considers that the substitution of an air squadron, combined with a force of native levies, for a British battalion will materially increase the security of Aden against sea-borne attack, land attack and air attack, thus simplifying the problem of internal security.He holds that, in normal times, the proposed substitution would lead to a considerable measure of economy, and that, owing to the prevention of encroachment, and the assistance afforded in the administration of the Protectorate, adverse complications, necessitating a temporary increase of garrison, will be easier to avoid.(5.) If the Committee of Imperial Defence wish to pursue the matter further, we recommend that an Expert Committee should be set up to examine the financial aspects of the proposed change, in order that the Committee of Imperial Defence may be in a position to appreciate the amount of financial saving (if any) and the degree of risk (if any) which, after consideration of our Report, they may think to be involved.(Signed) BEATTY.G. F. MILNE.H. TRENCHARD.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, April 27, 1927.ANNEXURE (A). [CCS. 65.] -Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, dated January 7,1927.1. &quot; OUR interests at Aden as a British possession and an important fuelling station and naval base on the main route to India and the Far East, need no demon-stration. That Aden must be held at all costs is and was a cardinal article of policy.&quot;   (OLD. Paper No. 748-B.)2. Apart from a purely naval attack, Aden is considered liable to a sea-borne raiding attack by 200 men (Paper No. J.D.C. 41). It is also liable to an attack by, the Imam of the Yemen. Some troops must also remain in the peninsula for the maintenance of internal order.3.   The present garrison of Aden consists of (it) Coast Defence Troops.(ii.) The Aden Troop,(iii.) 1 British Battalion,(iv.) 1 Indian Battalion.
4. As regards the coast defence troops, the number now at Aden is below the 50 per cent, of the war garrison, and no reduction is therefore possible. The coast defence artillery also provides the mobile armament.5. As regards the Aden Troop, some cavalry is required to perform the duties which cannot be carried out by infantry or by the Royal Air Force, and a squadron (which the Aden Troop is) is the smallest cavalry unit. It has a detachment of 2 troops at Habil (railhead).6. As regards infantry, there is a permanent detachment, found by the Indian battalion, of 2 platoons at Perim and 2 platoons at Kamaran. These cannot be dispensed with.7.   The duties which the infantry might be called upon to perform are :  (a.) Defence of the land front. (b.) Defence of vulnerable points.(c.) Possible reinforcements of Perim (this occurred in the late war). (d.) Maintenance of internal security.(e.) Reinforcements for Sonialiland. These might be required if the Italian operations against the Mijertein are carried out resulting in the stirring up of our Somali tribes.8. Throughout the greater part of the late war the land front of Aden was subjected to continuous attacks by the Turks, necessitating reinforcements, bringing the garrison up to 1 squadron cavalry and 6 battalions. It is not suggested that an attack by the Imam, on a similar scale, is to be apprehended, although it must be remembered that he has a regular army of 2,500 men and 3 or 4 batteries of artillery available for operations on the Aden front, and that these can be reinforced by an indefinite number of tribesmen.9. The Chiefs of Staff recently considered two specific questions which were referred to them by the Committee of Imperial Defence. They reported (C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B) that-(i.) The Aden Protectorate could not be cleared either by air action or by a combined operation except at a cost which would not be commensurate with the results obtained, (ii.) Further encroachments by the Imam might be prevented by the employment of a squadron of bombing machines, but, should offensive action on these lines be decided upon, the possibility of an attack on Aden itself, by the Imam, and the consequent necessity of increasing the garrison at that place, must be borne in mind.The. bombing squadron is being despatched to Aden in February. Should, therefore, action against the Imam be undertaken to prevent further encroachment, the question of increasing the garrison of Aden rather than its reduction will be the point for consideration.authority&apos; to despatch this squadron was given on the understanding that no increase of the Air Force was thereby authorized and that it should be regarded as one of the Home defence squadrons (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 720-B, 738-B, 739-B). It is presumed, therefore, that the Squadron will not remain at Aden after com-pletion of the specific duty for which it is being despatched.10. It has been decided (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 738-B and 749-B) that, in order to ensure the security of the harbour, we must hold the hinterland as far as the end of the railway. Even with the support of a bombing squadron, this task would be far beyond the capabilities of one. battalion, depleted as it must always be by one company on detachment and troops maintained in the peninsula for internal security purposes. When the bombing squadron departs on completion of its duty, the inadequacy of one infantry battalion as a garrison is so obvious as to need no comment.11. The nearest available reinforcements would be from India, and approxi-mately 14 days would elapse before they could arrive at Aden.  -12. From the point of view of defence of the land front, it is therefore con-sidered that, until our differences with the Imam have been settled, the reduction of the garrison by one battalion would not enable us to ensure the protection of such portion of the hinterland as is considered essential for the security of the harbour.13. In peace time the normal duties devolving on the infantry garrison are heavy and have greatly impeded proper training. The exact duties cannot be detailed, but the General Officer Commanding at Aden (who is now on leave and ogives his information without reference) says that the reduction of the infantry
garrison by one battalion would so increase the duties of the remaining battalion that the men would not get three nights in bed.14. It is seen, therefore, that neither for peace nor war is the reduction of the infantry garrison by one battalion a possible solution of the financial difficulties. The withdrawal of the British battalion as suggested by the terms of reference entails the reversal of the policy that our more important naval bases should have a British garrison. We should not lull ourselves into a feeling of false security by the com-parative tranquillity that now reigns on the seas East of Suez. This tranquillity is due not so much to the adequacy of our military garrison as to the inability to wage, or temporary aversion from, war on the part ot our potential enemies. It is also advisable to have British troops in case of an internal rising on the part of the 30,000-40,000 non-British population, which includes Indians, Arabs, Somalis, and some 2,000 Zeidis. The withdrawal of the Indian battalion entails the withdrawal of the detachments from Perim and Kamaran, for which British troops are unsuitable..15.   There remain the two alternatives of (a.) Replacing the Indian battalion by local levies.(b.) Retaining a detachment only of the Indian battalion.As regards (a), previous experience in the case of the Yemen battalion was unsatisfactory. It murdered one of its officers, was generally unreliable, and was disbanded in 1924. The tribes from which such levies could be recruited are not of a fighting class and are markedly inferior to the Zeidis whom they would be required to meet. The resultant financial saving would also be small, as experience has shown that local levies are more expensive than Indian troops.As regards (b), in addition to the great objection of having such detachments, the financial saving would be nil, as the cost of the remainder of the battalion that was not in Aden would have to be borne by the Imperial Exchequer.It is considered, therefore, that alternatives (a) and (&amp;) would be unsound and would not result in material economies.ANNEXURE (B). [CCS. 66.]--Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff, dated February 3, 1927.1. THE Chiefs of Staff have been instructed (CCS. Paper No. 58) to advise whether economy in the defence of Aden can be effected, without undue risks, by the substitution of a squadron of the Royal Air Force for the British infantry battalion which now forms part of the permanent garrison, or by any other means.The following memorandum is submitted in accordance with the conclusion of the 43rd Meeting of the Chiefs of Staff, when a preliminary discussion was held.2. It has been decided (OLD. Paper No. 749-B) that a bombing squadron shall proceed to Aden for operations against the Imam. This air unit will probably arrive during March 1927.A brief review of all forms of attack to which Aden may be subject is necessary in order that the effect of any alteration in the permanent garrison may be viewed in correct perspective.3. Scale of A attack.(a.) Sea-borne. In 1914 the scale of sea-borne attack anticipated from a European Power was &apos;&apos; a raiding attack by unarmoured vessels capable of landing a small force&quot; (O.D.C. Paper No. 478-M). This is almost identical with that now assessed (OLD. Paper No. 169-C) from Japan, i.e., by light cruiser, submarines and landing parties, not exceeding 200 men (Paper No. J.D.C. 41).(b.) Land Attack. In 1914 the mainland of Arabia was under Turkish influence, and the scale of land attack to be feared was considerable. Heavy attacks were, in fact, delivered against Aden during the war, but considerable army reinforcements were sent in time to repel them. Under present conditions the liability to serious attack by the Imam, or other unorganised tribes, is slight in comparison.(c.) Air Attack. In 1914 the liability to air attack was nil. In the future, not only must sea-borne air attack, by spotting for bombardment or light bombing
I *-&apos; (C.I.D. Paper No. 228-C), be countered, but allowance must, be made for thefossibility of attack on a small scale by aircraft belonging to the Imam, possibly with italian pilots, or to Ibn Saud, who is now developing a small air force.It can be seen that, as compared with the past, the scale of anticipated attack on Aden by a sea-borne raiding party is the same, by land it is less and by air it is greater.4. Native Levies.The formation of an irregular corps of local levies has been advocated (para-graphs 16 and 17, C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B) as an essential corollary to operations against the Imam.A force of this nature, about 400-500 strong with British officers, Avould materially assist in the administration and defence of the Protectorate, and would have a steadying influence in the event of war.The Air Staff therefore recommend that, if the infantry garrison is partially replaced by a Royal Air Force squadron, this force should be retained as a permanent measure.Since the Italians now recruit largely from the Aden Protectorate for military service in Eritrea and elsewhere, no difficulty as regards supply of suitable material is anticipated. The. fact that a part of the Yemen battalion mutinied when on detachment at Perim need not necessarily be regarded as a criterion of the loyalty of the proposed levies on the mainland.Military forces in Aden need not be regarded as though they were in occupation of an enemy country, which it is necessary to keep in subjection. Unless active hostility has been shown to British rule, it seems advisable that as far as possible local forces with British officers should be. utilised to assist in the maintenance of order and other defence duties, in the same way as is now done in our other oversea possessions.5. Composition of Permanent Garrison.The present infantry garrison at Aden is the same as it was in 1914, namely, one British and one Indian battalion. There is also one Royal Air Force Flight of 4 aircraft.  The composition of the garrison is shown in Appendix I.If the Royal Air Force squadron to be sent to Aden remains there permanently in lieu of the present flight, no increase in the total strength of the Royal Air Force will occur, since this unit is being transferred from another locality.After satisfactory arrangements have been made regarding the Protectorate boundaries and the encroachments by the Imam (vide C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B), there will be no necessity to maintain the Aden garrison at an increased permanent strength.The question therefore arises whether the squadron should then be withdrawn or the infantry garrison reduced.Events have proved that the present garrison has been unable to withstand encroachment, and there is no guarantee, if the Royal Air Force squadron is with-drawn after the situation has been stabilised, that the garrison as now composed will be able to maintain the integrity of the Protectorate. It might again prove, necessary to send a squadron to Aden.In view of the relative capacity of the two arms for defence of the Aden Protec-torate, the Air Staff consider that it would be more eflicient and economical to retain the Royal Air Force squadron, combined with a corps of irregular levies, than the British battalion, which could then be withdrawn and employed elsewhere. The presence of a squadron at Aden, even with a reduced infantry garrison, should provide ample insurance against future encroachment.In order to present the issue in simple form, two alternative garrisons as under, excluding coast defence troops, cavalry and ancillary troops, will be considered, and their ability to fulfil defence requirements will be briefly compared.Present garrison 1 British battalion.1 Indian battalion.1 Flight Royal Air ForceProposed garrison-1 Squadron Royal Air Force. 1 Indian battalion. Local levies.
6.   Defence Requirements.(a.) Defence of the land front. The present garrison is not mobile, and is not competent to prevent further encroachments by the Imam (paragraph 12, C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B), or to undertake an offensive. Its composition precludes anything beyond a close defence of Aden under all probable conditions of land attack.The proposed garrison would be far more mobile, and greater success in repelling attack might be expected. In the event of armed conflict with Arab tribes, a squadron is of far greater value than an immobile battalion, since it can break up an attack at a distance, and can also undertake reconnaissance and offensive action in enemy territory. Aircraft, therefore, provide a strong deterrent to encroachment or attack.(b.) Defence of vulnerable 2?points. A strength of nearly two battalions in Aden does not appear necessary to deal with a raid by 200 men from an enemy ship.The proposed garrison would be well adapted to counter such a raid, since not only would a proportion of infantry be available, but air reconnaissance should provide ample warning, and the enemy craft and landing parties could be attacked in force from the air.The Indian infantry, local levies and police available under the proposed scheme should prove quite capable of protecting vulnerable points against sabotage.(c.) Maintenance of internal security. It appears unnecessary to retain in Aden a British battalion, in addition to other troops, in order to provide against internal revolt among a populace hitherto tranquil and of widely differing sympathies.Even if the British battalion is withdrawn, the proportion of organised troops to the native population in Aden itself will be considerably greater than in most British Colonies. Throughout the Protectorate, the needs of internal security will be more amply met by a squadron of aircraft, in conjunction with local levies, than by the present immobile garrison. Incipient trouble can be dealt with in the early stages, and immediate air action can be brought to bear on centres of active disturbance.(d.) Reinfoj-cement of Perim, the Red Sea and Somaliland. Under present conditions, infantry reinforcements to places outside the Aden Peninsula must be sent by sea.With the proposed garrison, the landing grounds at Perim, Kamaran and Farsan Islands, and throughout British Somaliland, would enable rapid air reinforcements to be sent when required. British influence in normal times would be maintained by air demonstration and visits in a manner not possible at present.7.   The Functions of an Air Squadron in Defence.In addition to the defence duties outlined above, an air squadron at Aden could fulfil certain other functions which an infantry battalion could not accomplish. These may be summarised as follows : (a.) Control of the Protectorate and an aid to the civil administration.(b.) Maintain an air organisation enabling Aden to be rapidly reinforced by airfrom other centres in the Middle East, (c.) Repel air attack, either sea-borne or from Arabia. (d.) Air co-operation with coastal artillery.(e.) Air co-operation with the Navy in convoy protection and anti-submarine patrol. The Admiralty have proposed that aircraft for this purpose should be made available at the outbreak of war.(/.) Offensive air action by bomb or torpedo against enemy ships.The existing Royal Air Force Flight at Aden is too small to carry out duties other than co-operation with the Army. It could not undertake offensive action on a sufficiently large scale, nor aid materially in the administration of the Aden Protectorate or Somaliland.8.   Comparative Cost of Present and Proposed Garrtsons.(a.) Initicd cost. (i.) Since the permanent location of a squadron at Aden does not involve an increase in the total strength of the Royal Air Force, the question of initial cost for aircraft does not arise.
(ii.) Additional buildings to accommodate aircraft and personnel for a complete Royal Air Force squadron will be required, but the cost would be more than offset by the non-provision of the new barracks for British infantry, which, it is under-stood, have been projected.A site for these barracks, which are to replace those at the Crater, has already been selected, and a comprehensive scheme was forwarded to the Government of India in 1923. Consideration of the scheme was presumably deferred owing to uncertainty as to responsibility for the future administration of Aden, which has now been decided. Although the new barracks would not necessarily have been commenced during the next financial year, yet the necessity for their construction is no doubt becoming more and more urgent.The construction of additional accommodation for the Air Force would equally be required, but the cost can also be spread over a term of years.The saving effected by constructing new accommodation for the Royal Air Force instead of for British infantry should amount to about  75,000.(b.) Recurrent cost. The annual cost of the additional Royal Air Force would be about  80,000; that of the British battalion may be taken as  165,000.The proposed garrison would also enable reductions in ancillary services to be effected, and an annual saving estimated at  100,000 should be achieved.The financial effect of the Air Staff proposals for the Aden garrison is shown in Appendix II.It is impossible at this stage to state what ultimate reduction in costs will be possible after a stabilisation of the situation has been reached by the employment of a squadron of aircraft, but it appears probable that certain other reductions could be effected later. For example, the Aden troop and certain ancillary units might well be reduced to a nucleus and made capable of expansion to war strength when the political situation so changes as to make such a measure necessary.Since the annual cost of an Indian infantry battalion is only about half that of a British battalion, the economy effected by its replacement with a Royal Air Force squadron would be very small.9. Summary.The Air Staff are of the opinion that (1.) The Royal Air Force squadron which is being transferred to Aden in accordance with the recent Cabinet decision should remain there as a permanent part of the garrison, in substitution for the existing flight.(2.) An irregular corps of native levies, about 400-500 strong, with British officers, to be formed as soon as can be arranged. Existing accommoda-tion, on the small scale required, can be utilised. This measure would be in accordance with the principle applied to other British Colonies and Protectorates that local forces should be used in the defence and security of their own territory.(3.) After the Royal Air Force squadron and organisation at Aden have become established, and after a satisfactory arrangement with the Imam in regard to the Protectorate boundaries has been arrived at, the British battalion should be withdrawn.(4.) A Royal Air Force squadron, if substituted for the British battalion, would have a wide scope for useful employment in peace time, and would, in conjunction with the remaining troops, not only amply fulfil internal security requirements, but would also provide a more efficient means of resisting encroachment into the Protectorate than is afforded by the present garrison.In war, the additional security achieved by this measure of substitution will be great, since aircraft can fulfil many of the general defence functions of the battalion, and numerous other duties in addition The security of the port from land attack will be considerably increased, since offensive action can be taken; an additional deterrent to sea-borne attack will be provided, and ample security against air attack will be-available.(5.) The substitution of a squadron, combined with a force of native levies, for the British battalion, would not only effect considerable economy in the recurrent cost of the garrison, but would also enable a saving in capital
cost to be made, since extra accommodation for the Royal Air Force unit could be constructed more cheaply than the projected new infantry barracks.(6.) On the withdrawal of the British battalion, it should prove possible to bring about additional economies in the ancillary services of the Aden garrison.Appendix I.The Garrison of Aden, December 1926. 1 Battalion British infantry.1 Battalion Indian infantry; 2 half-company detachments at Perim andKameran Island.

ANNEXURE (C).Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, dated february 24, 1927.1. IN accordance with the conclusions of the 43rd Meeting of the, Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of the Air Staff has circulated a memorandum advocating the permanent retention at Aden of the squadron that is now being sent there for the specific purpose of dealing with the encroachments on the part of the Imam of Sana&apos;a, and that the British battalion should be withdrawn. There are certain portions of this memorandum with which I cannot agree.2. The air policy as explained to the Dominion Representatives at the recent Imperial Conference (C.I.D. Paper No. 745-B, p. 16), contains the following passage : *&apos; Undue dispersion would, however, be detrimental to the fullest develop-ment of the air service, and at present, when much research and experiment is required, it is desirable to maintain the bulk of the Royal Air Force at home.&quot;The permanent location of one squadron Royal Air Force at Aden, unless the results thereby to be gained are out of proportion to the dispersion involved, does not seem to be in consonance with this principle.3. (a.) It is agreed that the present scale of sea-borne attack is identical with that of 1914, but, on the other hand, it must be remembered that there is now a greater incentive to attack in that the oil fuel depot has been established since that date. A depot of this nature is an attractive objective and its destruction is more easy to carry out than that of a &quot;coal depot.&quot; The security of this depot is an important factor in the rapid transfer of the Fleet to the East, and for this reason inter alia it is laid down in C.I.D. Paper No. 748-B &apos;; That Aden must be held at all costs, is and was a cardinal article of policy.&quot;(6.) As regards a land attack, undoubtedly the Turks as a nation were more formidable than any of the present tribes of Arabia, but they were never looked on as our probable enemy. In any case, an attack on Aden by the former could not have come as a surprise, and we relied, quite rightly, on having time to reinforce the garrison before an attack in force could be made.Prior to 1914, there was comparative peace in South-West Arabia. To-day, the Imam lays claim to the whole of Aden, and is likely to maintain that claim, even though he may take no steps to enforce it. As envisaged by the Air Staff, Ibn Saud may, later, also be our enemy, in which case the scale of land attack will be consider-ably greater than it now is or was. But it is not solely the danger of an organised attack in force by any Arabian tribe that may have to be met, but a sudden rising and advance on their part.  The permanent garrison must be adequate to meet this.4.   In C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B. paragraph 16, the Chiefs of Staff reported-&quot;An essential corollary to the successful conduct of these operations is the protection&apos; of such advanced landing grounds as are necessary. For this duty we think that it might be advisable to raise local levies under the command of British officers.&quot;The Air Staff have distorted this paragraph to read : &quot; The formation of an irregular corps cf local levies has been advocated (paragraphs 16 and 17 of C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B) as an essential corollary to operations against the Imam.&quot;In any case, when this suggestion was made by the Chiefs of Staff, there was no question of the withdrawal of the British battalion.As pointed out in Paper No. CCS. 65, paragraph 15, previous experience of the Yemen battalion proved unsatisfactory. The tribes within the Protectorate area have no fighting value and the personnel for any levy that is to be raised must be drawn from the frontier tribes, who are hillmen, or tribes further within the country now belonging to the Imam. Besides being of Yemen stock, and, therefore, more inclined to favour the Imam than ourselves, Sir Gilbert Clayton, in C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B, paragraph 17, describes them as &quot; at present lawless and riddled with local dissension and intrigue.&quot; They would be useless unless they were commanded by British officers, and I do not consider it would be fair to ask British officers to
command natives, who, in addition to being recruited from our most likely enemy, bear a character as above described, especially as they are destined for the protection of advanced aerodromes without any backing in the shape of British infantry.The Air Staff quote in favour of the levies that the Italians employ them largely in Eritrea and elsewhere. Very possibly they may be of use in those places, but it must be remembered that the lied Sea separates these Italian levies from their homes and denies them the opportunities and inducements for intrigue. The fact that the Italians recruit the Yemeni levies for use in Italian territory is no criterion of their trustworthiness in the Aden Protectorate. In any case, it is false economy to substitute inferior and unreliable natives for British troops in a place of such importance as Aden.5. The defence requirements of Aden are considered in Paper No. C.O.S. 66, paragraph 6, under the conditions of the present garrison and a garrison proposed by the Air Staff. I agree that the proposed garrison is more mobile and that the composition of the present garrison precludes anything beyond a close defence of Aden under all probable conditions of attack. In OLD. Paper No. 738-B 21 (5), the Chiefs of Staff recorded their opinion that, from the military point of view, it was necessary to occupy only such portions of the Aden Protectorate as are essential to the security of the naval base and the present garrison as admitted by the Air Staff is suitable for this purpose. The proposed garrison can be definitely described as unsuitable for close defence. The further statement by the Air Staff that a squadron can break up an attack at a distance, needs qualifying in that it presumes that the attacker will advance and attack during the hours of daylight and in such formations as will offer targets that can be hit by the weapons carried by aircraft. The tactics of hill tribes are not to advance in massed formations; they are adepts in the art of concealment &quot;and movement by night, and to expect an enemy to advance and attack in a method best suited to his adversary is not sound doctrine. The results of the Air operations on the North-West frontier do not encourage one to put much faith in their ability to engage tribesmen in hilly country.6. It is agreed that offensive action at a distance should delay the enemy, but, as stated in C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B 21 (2), &quot; This squadron, to attain its object, must operate beyond the frontier .... ; should offensive action on the lines indicated be decided^ upon, the necessity of increasing the garrison must be borne in mind.&quot; This conclusion, signed by the Chief of the Air Staff at the Chiefs of Staff Meeting on the 8th November, seems hardly consistent with the conclusions in Paper No. CCS. 66, where the addition of a squadron Royal Air Force and the withdraAyal of the British battalion is advocated. It is, however, noted that the Chief of the Air Staff, Avhen representing the Chiefs of the Staff at the Committee of Imperial Defence, gave his personal views, which differed from those to which he had,previously assented..7. If the garrison of Aden was required only to protect that base from a sea-borne raid by 200 men, a strength of two battalions might be more than -was required. The oil depot is a very vulnerable point, but there are other points also requiring protection^ The garrison is not calculated, as suggested, solely on the assumption that its duty is to repel this type of raid. Among its other duties are the defence of the land front, the maintenance of internal security, and prevention of sabotage. After deducting troops on.detachment, on protection duties and guards, the available balance of one Infantry battalion would be totally inadequate to repel a raid. The Air Staff seem to have overlooked the fact that the enemy can choose his own time for a raid, and that he will select a time when he has the greatest chance of success. This will be when the garrison is threatened from other sources, and is engaged in: the defence of the land frontier or on internal security duties. The enemy can also select the actual hour at which to make his raid. As stated by Mr. Winston Churchill in that portion of his book published in the &quot; Times &quot;on the 14th February: &quot; However absorbed a Commander may be in the elaboration of his thoughts, it is necessary, sometimes, to take the enemy into consideration.&quot; Admittedly, aircraft can carry out reconnaissances at great ranges, but they cannot be certain of spotting before dusk any or every enemy ship that may be within steaming distance of this.base before, dawn. Aircraft during the hours of darkness is powerless to prevent the raiders either from landing or, once landed, from, reaching their objective, and it is little consolation to know that the raiders&apos; ships can be attacked, and perhaps sunk, after they have accomplished their object and rendered the base useless for the purpose it existed, thereby endangering the communications -of our, Empire.
8. The reason why the Air Staff suggest that the British battalion is unnecessary from the point of view of internal security is not known. At important places it has always been our policy to have a leavening of British troops in addition to any native garrison. At Singapore, during the recent war, the Indian battalion mutinied. Occurrences of this nature are certainly very rare, but the risk is not worth running at such an important place as Aden. The other overseas possessions to which the Air Staff refer in paragraph 6 (c) are not known; they may be in East or West Africa, but these places are not vital to our communications. Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore and Hong Kong are similarly situated to Aden as being naval bases. At all these places a British garrison is provided, and their necessity has never been questioned. The India Office should, in any case, be asked their views on this point before a decision is taken.Whether the population is unanimous in its views or has widely differing sympathies is not of any importance. At Calcutta the various communities in the population have widely antagonistic views amongst themselves, but it has never been suggested that the British battalion should be withdrawn.9. The garrison of Aden has never been looked on as in occupation of an enemy country. It is for this very reason that the weapons carried in aircraft are the least suited for employment in maintaining order locally, and in India, for the purposes of internal security, stringent regulations are in force regarding the use of aircraft. No amount of machines flying in the air can administer a country. By personal contact alone can this be done, and contact can only be established on the ground.10. It is claimed that, for the maintenance of internal security, incipient trouble can be. dealt with in its early stages and immediate action brought to bear on centres of activity. This statement may be true for certain countries and on rare occasions, but where are these &quot; centres &quot; in the Protectorate where trouble, may be expected to be brewed? The statement presumably infers that this centre will be machine-gunned and bombed, but it is not known how from aircraft it is proposed to single out natives who are in revolt from those that are peaceably inclined.To attempt to kill a party of natives, not all of whom can be singled out as rebels, seems hardly a way to administer a country with justice and on British lines.11. As regards maintaining British influence by means of air demonstrations and visits, it is pointed out that the Farsan Islands do not belong to us and that our influence at Perim is not on the wane.12. Many functions have been mentioned in C.O.S. Paper No. 66, para-graph 7, that an air squadron can perform and which cannot be carried out by a British battalion. With the exception of (a), all these are agreed to. But the air squadron may be called on to perform, at the same time, many of the functions mentioned in addition to the other defence duties enumerated. They would pre-sumably concentrate on the more important duties, which may be taken as the defence of the land frontier and defence against sea-borne raiding attack, and it is for these two purposes that I consider a British battalion better suited than a Squadron of 12 aeroplanes, especially when the greater losses that are sure to occur in war are taken into consideration. In mobility and range, aircraft are decidedly superior to infantry, but, although these are important factors in war, they are not, in them-selves, a sure defence, neither are they essential to the administration of the natives of a Protectorate with whom we are at peace. But it is this very mobility that the Air Staff apparently ignore and which admits of the quick reinforcement of the garrison at Aden. The reinforcement of Aden by infantry entails their transport by sea and consequent delay, whereas a reinforcement by aircraft can be quickly carried out from Egypt at much less expense. It seems, therefore, wiser and more logical to maintain the surer form of close defence on the spot and to reinforce it when necessary by that arm which can get there most quickly and economically.13. Judging by the. last part of paragraph 8 of C.O.S. Paper No. 66, and by statements of the Chief of the Air Staff at the 43rd Meeting of the Chiefs of Staff, the proposed withdrawal of the British battalion is only a first instalment of a still greater reduction. Ultimately, it appears that a garrison is envisaged, consisting of one Squadron Royal Air Force, half troop cavalry, 400-500 levies, and coast defences. The inadequacy of such a garrison in view of the statement made in OLD. Paper No. 748-B needs no comment.14. There remains the. financial aspect of the Chief of the Air Staffs proposed garrison of Aden as laid out in Appendix 2, to which the following remarks are offered : 
Increase Side.(i.) At the 218th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Secretary of State for Air suggested that the squadron for the temporary duty at Aden should be considered as one of the Home defence squadrons. Tins was accepted by the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence, who noted that the despatch of this squadron involved no increase of the Royal Air Force.The permanent location of a squadron at Aden is, however, a different matter. It is obvious that the duties of Home Defence cannot be carried out by a squadron located at Aden. An extra squadron, involving capital expenditure, must therefore be raised if the decision of the Cabinet, at their Meeting on the 3rd December, 1925, is to be adhered to.(ii.) In C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B the maintenance charges of a bombing squadron are given as  12,000 per month. According to Appendix 2 of CCS. Paper No. 66, the squadron at Aden is now due to cost only  112,500 per annum. These two estimates do not tally.(iii.) The Chief of the Air Staff estimates that local levies will cost only  20.000 per annum.  The Yemen battalion (415 strong) actually cost  40,000 a year.(iv.) No allowance has been made for extra aerodromes for this squadron if it is to cany out the visits to and administration of the countries envisaged.Decrease Side.ii.) British battalion,  165,000. This seems to be taking a parochial view of Treasury money. The cost of the Aden garrison will certainly be reduced on this account if the battalion is withdrawn, but as the Air Staff envisages its employment elsewhere (paragraph 5 of CCS. Paper No. 66), this money will not be saved to the Exchequer.(ii.) Ancillary services,  32,000. It is not known how this sum is arrived at, but as the Air Staff believes it to be approximately correct, the method of computa-tion should be given.15.   To sum up, I consider that (i.) Although aircraft has the advantage of mobility and range, it is &quot;unsuitable and cannot replace a British battalion for the purposes of the close defence of that part of the, Aden Protectorate which is-necessary to the security of the Naval Base.(ii.) Should the British battalion be withdrawn, the remaining Indian battalion would, on account of detachments and other protective duties, be insufficient to repel a sea-borne raid on the scale to which Aden is liable, and that aircraft is unable to repel such raid, especially if made during the hours of darkness or during misty weather, (iii.) The material available for Native Levies is either unsuitable or unreliable for service in the Protectorate, and that it would be unfair to ask British officers to do duty with them, especially if there was no British infantry as a backing, (iv.) For purposes of internal security, especially in a place of the importance of Aden, it is advisable to have a leavening of British troops.(v.) The administration of the Natives with whom we are at peace can only be done by contact with them on the ground, and that to deal with incipient trouble by means of the weapons carried in aircraft is not in accordance with British ideas.(vi.) It is wiser and more logical to maintain the surer form of close defence on the spot and reinforce it by that arm which can get there most quickly and economically, (vii.) It is most inopportune to consider the future permanent garrison of Aden at a time when a bombing squadron is being sent there to act against the Imam offensively and when the future situation cannot be foretold, (viii.) That the permanent addition of a squadron to the garrison of Aden must involve capital expenditure if the decision of the Cabinet as to the number of Home defence squadrons is to be adhered to, and that the decrease in cost claimed by the Air Staff on account of the substitution of a squadron for a British battalion are no savings to the British Exchequer.(Initialled) G.

(1.)-ADEN GARRISON. (OLD. Paper No. 151-D.) (Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 220th Meeting, Minute 11 (b).)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on the subject of the Aden Garrison (C.I.D. Paper No. 151-D).THE PRIME MINISTER said that the question of the garrison of Aden must be reserved for the Cabinet to decide, but it would be useful if the views of the Committee of Imperial Defence on this question were on record.SIR GEORGE MILNE said that he had nothing to add to the opinions which he had expressed in the Memoranda annexed to the Report. These were summarised in paragraph 15 of Annexure (C). Frankly, he was in entire disagreement with the Chief of the Air Staff on this question. He based himself on the fact that it had not been proved that a squadron of Air force was either more efficient in defence or more economical than a battalion of British infantry.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that his views also were fully set out in the Report; they were summarised in paragraph 9 of Annexure (B). The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was correct in saying that it had not been proved that an Air squadron was either more efficient in defence or more economical than a battalion of British infantry. On the other hand, it had been definitely proved that a Battalion of British infantry had failed to prevent encroachments, and was unable to hold our Aden frontier inviolate. It was impossible to prove what an Air Squadron could do in Aden unless it were given the opportunity of trying; and if it were not given this opportunity, it was impossible to show economy. In Iraq, Trans-Jordania and Palestine, the Air Force had already proved that they could do what they claimed. Ancillary services had been reduced, and expenditure curtailed. He had recommended that the system of air control should be tried at Singapore, but he had been told that his case was not yet proven. He strongly advocated the experiment being made at Aden as soon as the local situation permitted.LORD BEATTY observed that he had nothing to add to what was said in the Report.SIR THOMAS SCOTT outlined the functions of the various units which at present composed the garrison. The Aden Troop, which was about the strength of a squadron of Indian Cavalry, furnished a detachment of 2 troops at Habil to cover Lahej. Generally speaking, the. Troop was employed round the Settlement frontier, which ran 12 miles from the Fortress of Aden. That frontier had never been encroached. The Protectorate frontier was roughly 40 miles from the settlement frontier, and it was impossible for the existing garrison to protect the whole of that area. The Indian Infantry battalion, normally 700 strong, was generally reduced to a strength of about 600 in a very short time, owing to detachments and admissions to hospital, &amp;c. This battalion supplied detachments at Perim and Kamaran, two platoons at each place. It Avas to be noted that Kamaran was of international importance, as the big plague lazaretto of the East.   In case, of disturbance the battalion might also be required to furnish a(garrison for Sheikh Othman, while on occasions Somaliland had also required help. In those circumstances, the Indian infantry battalion could scarcely be regarded as a factor in the defence of Aden itself. The British infantry battalion was in effect the right hand of the Commander of the Aden garrison. It furnished protection for the magazines, the oil fuel, the coal supplies, the wireless station and Eastern Telegraph Station; it provided the reserve for local fortress defence; and it was primarily instrumental in maintaining internal security. Its very presence had a steadying influence in Aden and the surrounding district which it was impossible to assess in terms of bayonets; and it was, in his opinion, out of the question to remove it from Aden.The Fortress Company of Sappers and Miners was only about 40 strong, and consisted chiefly of artificers.  It was of little or no use for defence purposes.As regards the Air Force, he considered that one flight was sufficient for the maintenance of order between the Settlement and the Protectorate frontiers. The existing Flight had rendered excellent service,- and had been largely instrumental in saving Somaliland from disaster.
To sum up : he considered the battalion of British Infantry, supported by a Flight of Royal Air Force, was essential as a portion of the garrison for Aden. Continuing, he said that he deprecated the employment of local levies. Experience had shown that they were totally unreliable for service in the Aden Protectorate, although they might be of value elsewhere. The material for the levies were subjects of the Imam and came from the Yemen, a country eaten up with jealousy and fanaticism. It would be grossly unfair to ask British officers to take them out on detached duties. Incidentally, the Yemen Infantry had murdered one of their officers at Perim.Mr. AMERY asked whether these strictures applied to our own hill tribes such as the Audalis, who were not of the same creed as the subjects of the Imam.SIR THOMAS SCOTT replied that these men also had been enlisted in the Yemen Infantry, and were unreliable, in his opinion.SIR CLAUD JACOB, in reply to a question from Sir Samuel Hoare, said that the Yemen Infantry had been in existence for 5 years before they were disbanded.Mr. CHURCHILL said that it would be remembered that, when this matter was discussed by the Cabinet, it was generally understood that some substantial economy would be effected as the result of the enquiry by the Chiefs of Staff. He was so resolved on this point that he had already made a cut of  100,000 in the Colonial Office estimates under the Middle East Vote. If no economies were effected, a Supplementary Estimate would be necessary, and, in view of the expenditure now being incurred in China, it was of paramount importance that this should be avoided. With regard to the Report of the Chiefs of Staff, he was convinced that in one respect, at any rate, the dangers which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had in mind were exaggerated. One of the reasons given for the retention of the British battalion at Aden was that it was required to guard against a sea-borne attack by 200 men presumably by Japan. He could not think that there was the slightest danger of such an attack materialising within any reasonable period of time. If the Chief of the Imperial General Staff were really anxious about Aden, how did he feel about Gibraltar, which was far more important than Aden, and where there was now only one Battalion instead of the normal garrison of two.Mr. Churchill explained how simple a matter it would be for the Spaniards to capture Gibraltar by a cowp-de-main if they were minded to make the attempt. That they were not so minded was due to fear of the consequences of such an act; and the same deterrent applied to the Japanese in respect of any attempt on Aden.Turning now to a different set of conditions, namely, the danger from the Imam, Mr. Churchill said that the problem presented by the Imam was the same sort of problem as had presented itself in Iraq before the system of air control was instituted. Prior to the institution of that control the expenditure on Iraq was some  30 to  40 millions a year, and we were rapidly reaching a point when the evacua-tion and abandonment of Mesopotamia was becoming a most desirable step in public policy. Despite the protests both of the General Staff and of Commanders on the spot, despite the arguments of Sir Henry Wilson, who had just relinquished the office of Chief -of the Imperial General Staff, the Cabinet had installed the Air Force and Levies in Iraq. As a result expenditure had been reduced from  40 millions to the region of  4 millions, and further reductions were imminent. The Committee were entitled to base their consideration of the Aden problem not only on the achievements of the Air Force in Iraq, but also on the proved error of the arguments employed by the General Staff against the scheme of air control in that country.Mr. Churchill recalled the achievements of the Royal Air Force in Somaliland, where a few aeroplanes had solved a problem which had baffled us for many years. The fact of the matter was that savage and quasi-savage peoples had no idea how to deal with Air power. Aden and Somaliland were one and the same problem, and the Aden-Somaliland area should be treated as one unit for purposes of defence. For his part he believed a large saving would be effected by handing-over Aden to the Air Force.It was, of course, most important that the seaward batteries should be kept in order and adequately protected. Serving with these batteries were some 250 white men. These, together with the white personnel of the Royal Air Force constituted a white nucleus sufficient to maintain authority in the central redoubt of Aden itself. Moreover it was to be borne in mind that there was a large garrison in Egypt, and that, if the situation clouded over, it would be perfectly simple to put one or two[161191 B 2
battalions from Egypt into Aden. The Chief of the Air Staff was ready to assume professional responsibility, formally and officially, and to guarantee that good and sound results would be produced. It, therefore, seemed prudent to follow the prece-dent set by the Cabinet of five years ago in discarding the advice of the General Staff in regard to Iraq, and to adopt the plan advocated by Sir Hugh Trenchard. He suggested that the Indian battalion which was now maintained at Aden at the expense of the British taxpayer should be returned to India at once, to fill the gap of two Indian battalions which had been sent to China, and which were also maintained at the expense of the Exchequer. The British battalion should remain at Aden until the Royal Air Force arrangements were complete. He was reckoning on effecting a saving of  200,000 this year; and it was essential that a decision should be reached without delay if a Supplementary Estimate was to be avoided.LORD BIRKENHEAD intervened to say that the cost of an Indian battalion was about  80,000 a year.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS asked what arrangements would be made in the meantime for garrisoning Perim and Kamaran. Was it not necessary that the Indian battalion should stay at Aden to provide detachments for those places, until the Air Force organisation was complete?Mr. CHURCHILL said that other arrangements should be made for care-taking; and Mr. AMERY pointed out that there were several hundred police available in Aden.LORD BALFOUR enquired who would be responsible for the seaward batteries.Mr. CHURCHILL said that the Air Force Officer in Command must clearly command the whole garrison.SIR SAMUEL LIOARE entirely agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in principle, but thought the present position was not quite so simple as he had described it. Until the trouble with the Imam was settled, it was essential to keep both the British and -the Indian battalions in Aden. On that point the Chiefs of Staff were agreed.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD corroborated this, and pointed out that the original reason for sending the squadron of Air Force to Aden was to deal with the Imam. The Imam had recently asked to meet the Resident at Aden; and until that discus-sion was settled, one way or the other, no reduction in the garrison was advisable.LORD BIRKENHEAD thought that, in these circumstances, it was premature to make any recommendation. -THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had, at the opening of their discussion, pointed out that it was a question which would in any case, have to be reserved for the Cabinet. In the meanwhile there should be a careful check of figures, and he suggested that an Inter-Departmental Committee should be set up to examine this matter.SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested that the Inter-Departmental Committee should take alternative hypotheses according as a British battalion only, or a British and an Indian battalion, were to be reduced.Mr. CHURCHILL said that this enquiry should be treated purely as a financial question. The Committee should be instructed to work out the costs of the various proposals without prejudice to the wisdom, or otherwise, of those proposals. He would like the Chief of the Air Staff, as it were, to tender for the job.- Mr. AMERY said that the question could hardly be solved by comparing figures. It was a question of defence policy. But experience had shown that the policy of air defence was, under certain conditions, the cheapest as well as the most effective. The immediate difficulties in Aden were similar to those which had obtained in Iraq, Palestine and elsewhere, and which had been so efficiently solved by Air Control. He suggested that the white man at Aden should be represented in highly efficient form, such as armoured cars, gendarmerie, and so forth, and that a large British infantry garrison was entirely out of place. He con-sidered that Aden should be made the responsibility of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, with the Air Ministry as his military advisers, on exactly the same lines as
had been followed in Iraq. As Secretary of State for the Colonies, he was fully pre-pared to undertake this responsibility, and to reduce the expense. The exact method and rates of reduction could only be determined by himself and his responsible technical advisers, as in Palestine and Iraq, as the new system succeeded.Mr. BRIDGEMAN enquired what the position would be in respect of the Naval Base.Mr. AMERY replied that he was prepared to see that the requirements of the Naval Base were met.LORD BEATTY said that the Admiralty attached very great importance to Aden. They could not agree to any experiments which involved a risk.Mr. CHURCHILL enquired whether the Chief of the Naval Staff was afraid of the Naval Base being overrun by the Imam.LORD BEATTY replied in the affirmative. He said that the Imam could easily put the place out of action by blowing up the oil, destroying the Wireless Station, and so forth. He did not suggest that the Imam was likely to do it, but that he could do it.Mr. AMERY observed that, if the skies clouded over, they could always move up a battalion or two from Egypt.LORD BEATTY pointed out that it would be easier and quicker to move an Air squadron; and this had been emphasised by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and himself in the Report under discussion.Mr. AMERY replied that the battalion could only be of use in case of war with a great Power; the air squadron, on the other hand, could cope with the only real danger in prospect now, viz., that from the Imam.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a.) That the question of the Aden garrison should be reserved for eventualconsideration by the Cabinet. (&amp;.) That in the meantime the Treasury should set up a Committee to examinethe costs involved in the various proposals for the garrison of Aden;the actual terms of reference for this Committee being left to theChancellor of the Exchequer.
Mr. AMERY pointed out that the real difficulty was that neither the. Admiralty nor the War Office, wislied. to take over both the peace and war commitments. It seemed desirable that Whatever organization was maintained there in peace time for care and maintenance duties should be used as j  nucleus for expansion on the outbreak of war anoi for training such local forces as it might be possible to raise. Before the war theycare and maintenance party/Of Royal Marines had trained about 300 natives, who had proved fairly satisfactory/except for the absence of men suitable for non-commissioned rank. He suggested jihat what was required was a smalFcare and maintenance party furnished by one ,or other of the two Services whicX could provide the necessary non-commiss^oned/cfficers for training volunteers, scAhat an organization/capable of defending the/Colony would be available on the. outbreak of war.      / / /SIR A^JSTEN CHAMBERLAIN enquired what would be necessary to defend the Colony in war time. / &quot; /Mn^ AMERY replied that/something in the nature of 300 to/i00 men and some guns would be necessary to prevent landing by raiding parties and to deny the use of the harbour to the enemy. y //Mr. CHURCHILL ^suggested that the Colonial Office/bright assume responsi-bility for the defence of St. Helena, as they had done in the,,ease of Nigeria, obtaining the services of the necessary British officers and non-commissioned officers for training local levies. / /LORD SALISBURY suggested there was no reason why any alteration should be made in the present system. /SIR GEOPcGE MILNE pointed out that at/present the Navy was responsible for St. Helena/in peace time, whilst the War Office had to defend it in war. It was evidently desirable that one Service should haye the whole commitment, and the sole point at issue was which service it should be./Mr. CHURCHILL pointed out that before the Avar the present system was m force, ana it seemed to have worked welly&apos;Why, then, was any change necessary?SI&apos;R GEORGE MILNE replied $hat before 1914 there were. British regular troops&apos; available in South Africa for immediate despatch to St. Helena, whilst now there were none. In reply to Mr/Churchill, he said that Sierra Leone would be unaole to spare the necessary war garrison.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS mentioned that he was particularly anxious not to have an Army Estimate on the cost of garrisoning St. Helena inpeaee. time, although this,       n A  ; * * &quot; A1&quot; ^^aitfiiiiiiMMJMMMBl^BMii^MMBi
