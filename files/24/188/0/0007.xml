This document is the property of His Britannic Majeaty&apos;a Government.Printed for the Cabinet, July, 1927.SECRET.Co** TOo.   3 0CP. 207 (2/).THE CABINET.THE PREPARATION OF THE ARMY FOR WAR.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. In 1919 it was decided that so far as the fighting services were concerned, it might be assumed that there would be no European war for 10 years. (Cabinet Committee on Finance : Meeting of loth August, 1919.)2. The question was brought up again in the Cabinet in 1924 but no decision was taken.   (Cabinet 64 (24), Conclusion 2.)3. I suggest that the previous decision should be extended to cover 10 years from the present date.4. In 1914 the Army was prepared for a European war and reserves had been built up available for incorporation in the six infantiy divisions of the expeditionary force, to bring it up to strength immediately.5. If we are still to be prepared at short notice for a European war and if we are to be ready to transport even three infantry divisions across the Channel, then the reserves, especially the skilled tradesmen, will have to be provided and maintained in peace time at great expense.6. If, however, our preparations are to be made for a war requiring a long sea voyage, then the prepare *ation of the base and the limitations of communications in the theatre of operations will give time for additional reserves to be enlisted and trained after the outbreak of war.7. If we are to prepare the Army for an early war in Europe, then such expensive armaments as heavy tanks and siege artillery must be provided and maintained at an active strength. If on the other hand war in the East has to be prepared for, expenditure may be avoided by keeping at a low level, from which expansion to a fighting strength might be made in some months, the equipment and personnel of arms only useful in Europe.8. While it is true that the size of the British Army and the conditions of service are determined by the requirements of India and our other overseas garrisons, yet its armament and the priorities in expenditure upon desirable equipment and stores are to a large extent conditioned by the view taken of where it is most probable that its services will be required.9. The constantly increasing pressure to reduce the estimates, the dwindling war stocks requiring replacement, the need for new mechanical devices and the continued defa-ulfTta payment of sums anticipated as appropriations-in-aid, combine to make it necessary to concentrate expenditure on the more immediate and pressing needs.10. I therefore ask for an early renewal of the decision of 1919.L. W.-E.The War Oemce,19th July, 1927.(1327/17)   100   7/27   w.o.p.   31u1
