(This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.)SECRET -.                                                               COPY No. CP.-212 (27). -CABINET.THE GENEVA OONFSRB^CS ON REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OP IfeVAL ARMAMENTS.The Cabinet Committee, with the addition of the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, have oontinued their consideration of the question of reduction and limitation of naval armaments, as requested by the Cabinet.2.  The Lord President of the Council has amplified the draft statement of policy, which he la d before the Cabinet at their last meeting, by adding&apos; to it a caveat in regard to the temporary character of the agreement so far as concerns Cruisers other than the large type which works with the Fleet.    The Committee submit the draft attached in Appendix I for the approval of the Cabinet.3. After discussing with the Ministerial Delegate? at the Geneva Conference the probable procedure of the Conference on their return and the effect likely to be produced by the Statement, the Committee are satisfied that the best method of giving publicity to it will be by an announcement in both Houses of Parliament.- 4.  The Admiralty advise certain modifications in the so-called &quot;Japanese scheme&quot;, the original draft of which is attached in Appendix II for convenience of
reference.    Instead of combining the tonnage of Cruisers and Destroyers only, as provided in the original scheme, the Admiralty propose to include also that of Submarines.    The parties to the agreement will then be permitted, within the aggregate tonnage of the three classes, to construct Cruisers, Destroyers or Sutanrinss in such numbers as each may deem suitable, subject only to an agreed ratio (12 : 12 : 8) as regards th3 10,000-ton Cruisers and a maximum tonnage allowano which the Admiralty desire to introduce for the larger class of Submarines. The Admiralty will lay before the Cabinet a revised version of the original scheme for presentation to the Conference.    The addition of Submarines to the combined tonnage would enable us to apply some of our tonnage to Cruisers instead of to Submarines and so to redress the balance.5.  In eoiiuiimicating the admiralty s proposals, the First Sea Lord (Lord Beatty) warned the Committee that, even with these modifications, the Japanese scheme involves a ratio towards Japan in respect of both the smaller Cruisers (5 : 3^) and of Destroyers belo* that which the Admiralty have hitherto deemed necessary.    In regard to Destroyers the effect would be that we should possess only 15 flotillas to Japan&apos;s 12, so that, in the event of difficulties with Japan, the greater part of our Destroyers would have to be sent to the Far East, leaving an insufficient margin in home waters a-nd the Mediter-ranean in the event of simultaneous trouble there.    The responsibility of accepting this risk is, in the opinion of the Coiimittee, one for the Cabinet rather than for the Board of Admiralty.6. The question of whether the agreement should be made until 1931 or 1936 was reserved by the Committee for considera-tion by the Cabinet.    The original view of the Cabinet, as set,forth in telegram No. 125 to Geneva (attached in Appendix iiifor convenience of reference) vas in favour of the shorter period.
The reason for this was that the United States of America would have a better chance of achieving parity in Cruisers by 1936 (by which time they would have laid down nine annual programmes of construction) then by 1931.    The Admiralty hove now expressed a strong preference for 1936.    They point out that, if the agreement terminates in 1931, the United States of America and Japan win then be free to say that in future they propose to build only Cruisers arrisd with 8-inch guns.    The whole of the programme of 6-inch gun Cruisers built by Great Britain between 1927 and 1931 would then, the Admiralty state, be outclassed b?/ the r*3w 8-inch gun Cruisers and we should be obliged to enter on a   new programme of 8-inch gun Cruiser construction to redress the balance.    On this the Committee observe that a similar situation would arise in 1936, possibly in an aggravated degree, since by that year we should have built still more 6-inch gun Cruisers; b?/ that time, on the other hand, the United States of America ana Japan might have built some &quot;6-inch gun Cruisers, and in that event might themselves be reluctant to render them obsolete by taking the lead in constructing a more powerfully armed type.-7. The Admiralty consider that, if the year 1951is decided upon, we must abandon our insistence on the whole the right to 6-inch gun, and/aim even the smaller type of Cruiserwith 8-inch guns, notwithstanding the additionalexpense.    They will advise the Cabinet further on thispoint.    The Committee note that an armament of 8-inch guns is likely to facilitate the acceptance of theseproposals by the United States of America, though theattitude of Japan on this point is less certain.k -3-
8. The Committee are strongly of opinion that the programmes of const ruction agreed to at the Geneva Conference should he rejsirded as naxiiua, and that the Government of the day should not be held to bs bound to build up to thorn, irrespective of what other nations are doing.    The Government - must remain free to settle their halloing programme each year within the limit permitted b.*. the Treaty in accordance with the needs  , of the situation and the available financial resources.9.  The recommendations of the Committee may besummarised as follows:-(l) The comprehensive statement of British policy in regard to reduction and limit-ation of naval arrraments (attached as Appendix i) should be announced in both Bouses of Paillament(2) The British Delegates should return to Gereva and endeavour to secure an agreement on the basis of the so-called &quot;Japanese scheme&quot; , modified as recomnanded by the Admiralty, who will lay before the Cabinet a revised version of these pro-posals incorporating the changes they desire.(3) The decision as to whether the agreement should terminate in- 1931 or in 1936 is&apos;   -reserved for the Cabinet.    If 1931 is adopted, the Admiralty propose to drop their insistence on 6-inch gun Cruisers and to have the right to arm even the smaller types of Cruiser with 8-inch guns, in order to avoid the risk tha-t the British 6-inch gun Cruisers built before 1931 may be outclassed and rendered obsolete after that year by a refusal on the part of the United States of America and Japan to limit their future small Cruisers to guns of 6-inch calibre.(4) The programmes of naval construction agreed to at the Geneva Conference should be regarded as a maximum, and the Government of the day should not be held to be bound to build up to them.    They must remain free to decids the programme of naval construction in eaoh year according to the needs of the situation and the &quot; available financial&apos;resources.9 &quot;whitehall gardenia , s.w. i,July 26, 1927. -4-
APPENDIX     I. SECOND REVISE OP DRAFT STATEMENT.The Conference on r&amp;val Disarmament na.v sitting at Geneva have discussed mam.;, important points in technical Coranittees and Plenary Conferences, but, in spite oi the efforts of our Delegates at Geneva, serious misapprehension of the aims of His Majesty1 s Government still prevails in some quarters.    His Majesty&apos;s Government has even been oharged with the^ desire to destroy that equality of sea-power as between the United States of America and the British Empire which the Washington Conference contemplated;-a suspicion for which there is no foundation.The invitation of the President of the United States of America to take part in a Disarmament Conference was understood by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to be based on his desire to develop the policy of the Washington Conference by diminishing yet further naval expenditure while i^aintaining national security.   With this two-fold end His Majesty&apos;s Government are in complete agreement, and they desire to measure the merits of every proposal by the degree to which it furthers this two-fo Id end. It is on this principle that thev have proposed to diminish the size and armament of battle ships, whilo leaving unaltered the numbers fixed at Washington. It is for this reason also that they suggest limita-tion in the number and armament of large fighting Cruisers on principles similar to those adopted at Washington .for battle ships.    This proposal, like the first, would greatly diminish national expenditure without endangering national safety.
The questions collected with small Cruisers, are of a more complicated character.    The strength of fleets can be stated in figures and compared with precision.    Their primary function is to fight other fleets, and, speaking broadly, they can easily be compared with each other.    No such simple way of looking at the subject is possible in the case of small Cruisers employed for police purposes in times of peace, and for protecting lines of communication in time of war.    Geographical considerations cannot be rationally ignored.    It can hardly be denied, as was clearly stated by us whon accepting the Presidents invitation, that suoh vessels are of more vital necessity to an Empire, whose widely scattered parts are divided from each other by seas and oceans, than to one which is essentially continental;    to an Empire whose most populous parts are dependent for their daily bread on seaborne trade., than to one which is self-supporting and self-contained;   to an Empire which would perish if it failed to protect its external trade, than to one for whom external trade, however important, was not a matter of life and death.It has to be noted further that the sea routes on which Britain depends ror her existence lie largely in narrow waters bordered by other States.    This is not the case with America, whose most important lines of coiiEinnication lie either on land within her own frontiers, by sea along her own coasts, or in the great oceans.     These circumstances reoeived due consideration at V. ashington in 1922 and have not lost any of their importance.    But it is hardly necessary to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government, while urging the special difficulties due to Britain&apos;s geographical
position, are far fron. claiming the least right to diotate any small Cruiser policy to other Pavers. They accept the general principles which, as they understand them, underlie the Presidents policy that no maritime Paver should maintain a larger navy than is rsquired for its own security.    To translate this into figures Is, for the reasons already given, far more difficult in tha case of small Cruisers than in the case of the larger types of surface vessels. Anything resembling the quasi-psrmanent formula adopted at Washington for battle ships is quite inapplicable to vessels designed for purposes which not only may, but must, vary with the geographical and economic position of the several Powers concerned.    It becomes even more inapplicable when strength is estimated in terms of gross tonnage, without reference to numbers or armament.    Two nations each possessing a hundred thousand tons of battle ships nay be regarded without serious error as being (so far) equal in fighting powej: No such statement can reasonably be made about two nations one of which has 10 Cruisers of 10,000 tons, while the other has 20 Cruisers of 5,000 tons.    It all depends upon eiroumstances; - though naval experts would probably agree that, if it came to fighting, the more numerous but smaller vessels would stand but a poor chance against their more powerful but less numerous opponents.    If so, the country which for any reason was obliged to distribute its available tonnage among smaller units would be at a permanent disadvantage compared with one which was able to adopt a different schema.    There would be nominal parity but real inequality..This is, of course, merely an illustration. But it suffices to explain why, in the opinion of
His Majesty&apos;s Government,   no provisions open to this kind of criticism should be given th? international authority already possessed by thos&apos;*; parts of the Treaty of Washington which deal with strength and numbers.    In the opinion or P.is l&amp;vjesty1 s Government there n-^sd bs no dif I icalty in arriving; at a temporary arrangement about the immediate future of Cruiser building.    But the British Siupire cannot be asked to give to any   such temporary arranrement the appearance of an imiiaitabls principle;- for this is liable to be interpreted In the future as a formal surrender of th? doctrine of marit1ma equality.  Such temporary agreement, must not be treated as a precedent, or deemed to onbody a settled principle.    Any other course would inevitably be interpreted in the future as involving the formal surrender by the British Empire of maritime equality, a consummation which Kis Majesty&apos;s Government are well assured is no part of the President&apos;s pplicy.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, July 26, 1927.

Important.Following from First lord for Prime Minister.My immediately preceding telegram.Following are lines on which it is hoped agreement may he reached as a result of discussions between British and Japanese delegations on cruisers and destroyers.Begins.British and Japanese delegations have discussed question of surface vessels and though Japanese delegation would have preferred to adhere to figure of 315,000 tons, they are ready in order to meet British view to transfer from 70,065 suhmarine tonnage for which they have asked 10,000 tons to tonnage of surface vessels.     British delegation are in the same spirit and subject to following conditions ready to reduce their surface vessel tonn&amp;ge from 550,000 to 500,000 tons.The two delegations could therefore agree to a total tonnage of surface auxiliary combatant vessels and submarines(1) For British Empire 590,000, for Japan 385,000.(2) Retention of an additional 25$ of total tonnage in old vessels.fl)
(3)    10,000 ton cxuisers to be limited in number-, for British Empire ahd United Stntes each 12,  for Japan 8.(4)    Retention of under-mentioned vessels;    for British Empire &quot;York&quot; and four cruisers of &quot;Hawkins&quot; class-For United States 10 cruisers of &quot;Omaha&quot; class-     Por Japan 4 cruisers of &quot;Furutaka&quot; class.(5)    Other cruisers-    Japan having no intention of laying dov.&apos;n any other  &quot; gun cruisers before December 31st, 1936, will not object to a clause that :&apos;jo other cruisers shall be constructed in excess of 6,000 tons displacement and to mount a gun exceeding 6&quot; before December 31st,  1936-(6)    That within total tonnage figure for cruisers (and) destroyers and submarines there shall be a definite agreed percentage allocated to cruisers fand) destroyers and submarines respectively *End s.fii)
APPENDIX    III.70Cypher telegram to 2.1r. London (Geneva).Foreign Office, 15th July, 1927.    5,30 p.m.No. 125.part I.Following for Mr. Bridgeman from Prime Minister. My immediately preceding telegram.We understand that you are working upon the following lines.      If so we are in complete agreement and there is no necessity now for personal consultation.We have at Washington agreed by treaty to equality of battleships.     We are now prepared to agree by treaty to equality of large cruisers.     We certainly do not mean to quarrel with America If - she chooses to build up to any strength which she deems necessary.      But we cannot admit by treaty that in regard to small cruisers the case of the British Empire resembles other Powers j    or that parity of number means parity of strength.     We cannot consent therefore to the    insertion in a great international Instrument of any provision which could be interpreted as meaning that we had bound ourselves to any arrangement which placed us in a position of permanent naval inferiority.PART II.Although therefore ready to agree to a ratio for 10,000 ton 8&quot; cruisers we could not agree to fixing by treaty a permanent total tonnage limit for all classes of ships whether specified in classes or lumped together. But we are ready to approve an agreement fixing the actual units of the annual programmes of new cruisers
for the three Powers during say the ne:rt five years or if absolutely necessary up to 1956, and of course tonnage of these units when added up could be embodied in the  Jgreement.     Such programmes would naturally enable America to reduce her leeway in cruisers up to the point beyond which she would stimulate further building on the part of Japan-     Should the three Powers be able to agree to such actual programmes a further scaling down all round might then be discussed and finally agreement be signed.XIe think that this is the line on which you are working.     Please remember, however, that the British annual programmes have never been fixed by Cabinet or agreed to by Treasury beyond financial year 1929-30 and we must have an unprejudiced opportunity of considering them.As to period of agreement we should much prefer the shorter as it better safeguards our position and affords better chance of agreement.     The longer the . period the nearer the Americans might come to equality of numbers in practice as distinguished from theoretical right to parity, and as explained In Part I of this telegram equality of numbers in the case of nations with such different needs and perils would result in act r:.l infer ior ity for us .(ii)
