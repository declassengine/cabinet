(Thia docxmiont is the property of His Britannic 2/flMa i e o t y&apos; s Gov o government nt). -*Tho Cabinet.,OIV-OV/II LEASES IN BRITISH CONCESSIONS Iff Oil IK A.Memorandum &quot;by II. LI. Off 3ce of Works . jL* 5In reply to tho Foreign Office memorandum it in not necessary to .enter into detail on the subject of the origin and early history of the British Concessions in China.These Concessions were., as 5.3 stated.,areas of land acquired by purohase by II,M.Governmentand held according to Chinese legal form on perpetuallease3 and sold (by auction) in lots at a profit on99 years leases.      It has been argued in the past,and is still argued by some oi&apos; the lot-holders,that K.1.1. Government was acting merely in afiduciary position on behalf of British traders andhas consequently no moral right to claim thereversionary interest in the property;    but theForeign. Office memorandum appears to indicate thatit is now admitted that there was no intention atthe heginning of dealing with the Concession a reason other than a commercial basis.    The point may.-however be reinforced by reference to a treasury minute of 1865* which indicated the policy of the in t&quot;time by say/ that in disposing of Concession lots &quot;care should be taken to make bargains as advantageoualy as possible for the public interest&quot;.    If any further evidence is necessary it is furnished by the refusal of the request of the Tientsin Municipal Council in 1867 (a refusal which was endorsed by the Minister and the Foreign. Office) that the surplus profits from sales of Concession lots should be handed over to the Council for public improvement works.     At the same time the use of the oxpression
1 speculating in land&apos;  in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Office memorandum and the reference in paragraph 3 to the 1 Crown13 ownership of the soil&apos; call for comment.     K.II.Government has limited its dealings in land in China bo normal procodure according to British practice, and has not infringed in any way upon the ownership of the soil by the Chinese Government.2.      As regards Sir Jolm Jordan1s view that the Government scheme for renewing the leases for 099 years in return for a fair consideration constituted the exploitation of an extra-territorial privilege * it may be pointed out that extra-tor r it or ia.lity is a personal privilege of British subjects and has nothing to do with the tenure of land.    Chinese sovereignty over the soil of the Concessions has never been questioned, and the ChineBe have, so far as it is known, never complained of exploitation on the part of H. LI. Government j any more than they have complained of the large fort Vines made by British speculators in Concession lots.3.      It is, of coursej recognised by everyone that in the present circumstances of China,  it is under sir able that H.I-.1. Government should remain in th position of ground landlord any longer than is absolutely necessary.     The- Office of V/orks and. the Treasury take the view that there has been all through the course of the negotiations both in North and South China no real obstacle from the Chinese standpoint to a settlement qf the land question on terms which would secure for all parties concerned that to which they wore legally and morally entitled,
neither more nor less:    that is to say,  (l)    the lotholdsrs would secure a perpetual lease at a generously fair price, (2) K.M. Government would realise part of the value of its interest in the iandj (3)    the Chinese Government would retain, what it already possessed, tho ultimate ownership of the soil subject to perpetual leases, and would, further, have no intermediary between it and the lotholders.The matter has always seemed to the Office of Works to be merely one of free and open negotiation, but it has bsen complicated by tho fact that the lotholder; have3 over since the initiation of the renewal scheme, made up their minds that by determined opposition and, as it seemed to them, the support of successive Ministers at Peking, they would be able eventually to obtain practical perpetuity without  payment or for a merely nominal sura.      It is hard to remain unimpressed by the fact - which, so far as is known, has not been questioned - that no proposals have been submitted to tho Chinese in any negotiations,  in North or South, which were directed towards a solution of the land question on the plain linos that K.M Government were according to Chinese laws the owners of the perpetual leases and proposed, before stopping out of the position of ground landlord, to realise their reversionary interest.    At Hankow the question of the land has boon left, open,&apos; and at Tientsin, the lot-holders themselves were allowed to propose their own solution, which was, not. unnaturally.,  that they should be granted perpetuity by the Chinese without payment.    Such a proposal, the draft of which was sent to the Chinese,.implied that the British Government was prepared to renounce any claim to be considered as owner of tho reversion, and it at once led the Chinese to reply with a counter-proposal that
they (the Chinese) should assume the position vaoatd by K.M. Government and merely confirm the existing leases. This is in the view of the Foreign Office impossible.the opportunity to obtain perpetual titles for the lotholdsrs has been lost;    this is presumably a reference to the present political conditions.     But it seems clear that technically the question can still be re-opencd on a change in the general situation. If the British subjects there, as land-holders, are left without, protection, they are presumably as individuals in the same unprotected position, and the whole question is, it is assumed, merely being allowed to await the proper moment for an attempt at a favourable solution.there has been no idea of sacrificing the Grown lessees at Tientsin (see paragraph 8 of Foreign Office memorandum) while it oan hardly be argued that their own interpretation of their just due has been framed with proper regard to the rights of the British tax-payer, who has in the past borne expenditure for their benefit, in aid of whioh British subjects in China have made no contribution. It is not necessary to say much about the Crown leases Renewal Reimbursement Fund except to observe that the claims of the lotholders could be satisfied by the Municipal Council commuting the future contributions leviable in respect of the extension areas and paying over to the Crown lessees the present worth of those contri.buti.onf3 plus the fund already accumulated..    Without going into details it oan be stated that the commuted sura in4.In paragraph 8. it is said that at HankowItt cannot be too strongly emphasised that
question would be less than the amount or tho fund already accumulated and should be well within the capacity of the Municipal Council to pay..&quot;j.     The immediate issue hinges on the question of the Tientsin agreement.    It is clear that what is decided here will bo a precedent for the other Concessions.    The Foreign Office propose that the lot-holders shall be given at once perpetual leases before the agreement is concluded.    It is difficult to appreciate tho grounds for the assumption that while tho Chinese would view with equanimity trie conversion of the existing subleases into perpetual tenure without pecuniary consideration, conversion accompanied by such pecuniary consideration would lead to insuperable opposition on tho part of the Chinese. It ia hard to believe that the ultimate commercial future of the Concessions is so obscure and the prospect of E.M. Government&apos;&quot;s support so uncertain., that leaseholders when faced with the issue will not prefer to secure on terms a perpetual lease rather than face the more definite risk implied in becoming the lessees of tho Chinese Government with only the remainder of 99 years to run.6.      In conclusionj the Office of Works would like to offer somo observations on the Annex to the Foreign Office memorandum.    The proposed plans therein described are, for the most partt tentative proposals discussed between the Departments, and do not represent plans which have beon tried and have failed.    The Office of Works would emphasise the fact that they required no persuading that tho Crown lease renews,! scheme must bo abandonod in favour of a sale outright
scheme; in fact they themselvesjrc&amp;de such a suggestion.    But this necessity does not ueen to have been present to tho mind of L;&apos;r. 0&apos;ilalley during hie negotiations ivith Mr. Ohen, and it is not surprising that the latter, as stated, found it difficult to &quot;swallow&quot; the idea of H.11.Government remaining indefinitely in the position of landlord. This, indeed j was the whole substance of Mr.. Chen1 a difficulty, and he had clearly no ideas as far an the available records of the negotiations show,  of denying the right of H.I.-. Government to transfer their reversion for a consideration.    In the case of the Tientsin proposals, the suggestion of the lotholders that K.I.I. Government should abdicate its rights and that the Chinese Government should give thorn perpetuity for nothing simply invited the latter Government to make the counter proposal that the existing leases should merely be confirmed.    The Kiukiang instance does no more than show that certain Nationalists were ready to attempt by sharp practice to create, evidence of the non-validity of the perpetual lease and lias, so far as is known., no reference to questions of reversion.    It is&apos;submitted that there is nothing to show that a determined effort has been made to discuss the question of the leases in a manner which would render&quot; possible the co-operation of the Chinese authorities, and it is in the- interests of the taxpayer that the Office of Works feel bound to support the Treasury in this matter.    They are riot insensible to the demands of policy and to the need for a prompt settlement of the difficult problems which face our negotiators in China-;    but they cannot
scheme; in fact they themselvesjrcade such a suggestion.    But this necessity does not seem tohave been present to tho mind of Mr. 0&apos;i.ialley during his negotiations with Mr. Chen, and it is not surprising that the latter, as stated, found it difficult to &quot;swallow&quot; the idea of H.11.Government remaining indefinitely in the position of landlord. This, indeed, was the whole substance of Mr. Chen1s difficulty, and he had clearly no idea, as far as the available records of the negotiations show, of denying the right of II..7-. Government to transfer their reversion for a consideration.    In the case of the Tientsin proposals, the suggestion of the lotholders that K.I.I.

They are not insensible to the demands of policy and to the need for a prompt settlement of the difficult problems which face our negotiators in China;    but they cannot
help feeling that there should be room in that settlement for tho just and    legal rights of H.M. Government as well as for fairness to the lotholders and consideration for the legitimate expectations of the Chine se pe ople.H.I.I. Office of Works, 24th August^ 1927.
