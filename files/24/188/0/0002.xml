2Q     Tlio Cabinet will recollect that the authors of the   Joint memorandum (C?B 140 (27))  after stating the grounds for their belief that British representation in one form or another is really needed in most of the Dominions, laid emphasis on the considerations -(1)    that the form which such representation should ta3:e must necessarily depend on the varying circu istances of the different Dominions and upon the point of view of the several Governments, and (2)    that, while the views of the Dominions concernedmust naturally he taken into account, the decision on the question of British representation in the Dominions is primarily one for His Kajestyrs Government in Great Britain,.r50     At the CommitteeTs request, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs formulated, in the light of the above considerations, certain proposals in regard to British representation in Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, iv;e&quot;&quot; Zealand, the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free state     These proposals are set out in a Iiemorandum (B,,R0DS  (27) 3) a copy of which Is attached to this Report as Appendix. - .40 The proposals may he briefly summarised as follows;-CANADAv The British Representative, who should be designated &quot;High Commissioner for Great Britain in Canada&quot;, should, be responsible to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and should b3 In a position to represent the policy of the British Government on all matters^ particularly foreign affairs and questions

It is undesirable that the British representative in Australia should be a High Commissioner.      He should be a person, responsible to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, vrith functions    and duties somewhat similar to those of the Australian liaison officer in London,     His appointment should, not in any way affect the position of the Trade Commissioners or of the prGsent British Government Representative for Illgration, but as in the case of the proposed High Commissioner in Canada he -:ould be authorised., if specifically requested or instructed, to make personal representations to Commonwealth Tinisters on trade matters in

If this proposal is adopted, no furtheosr action as regards British representation in He&quot;&quot;&apos; Zealand is for the tine being required.TJHIOH 0? It is proposed that the &quot;imperial Secretary&quot;,SOUTHAFRICA. ite, the Secretary to the High Commissioner for SouthAfrica should be the Representative of the British, Government in the Union.     If so, he should have the assistance of an officer from the staff of the Foreign Office.     Alternatively the High Commissioner might be provided with a second Secretary who should act as the British Representative vis-a-vis the Union Government in inter-Imperial matters.
T1U IRISH The Secretary *t State for DominionAffairs proposed to take steps to ascertain the present views of the Free State Government on the question.of British representation in the Irish Free State.5.      The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs has had prepared, a purely provisional sketch estimate of the cost of the above proposals,.Exclusive of any provision in respect of siipernnnuation the maximum total expendituremight amount to  39,500 per annum made up as follows:-1,    Cost of EstablishmentsaCanada .. ,................ 14, 500Australia ...............o 6,000New Zealand.............. 2,000Union of South Africa (additional to present cost of Office of High Commissioner for SouthAfrica) 4,000Irish Free State......... 3,0002.

BROrOSALS OF 6.      The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTHE Secretary Of STiTE FOR        subnitted to the Committee an alternative estimate, yO^IGN API&apos;AIRS.based upon the view that in this matter it was desirable to proceed by gradual degrees and not, in the initial stages, to taice action as    regards representation in any Individual Dominion in the absence of a clear intimation from that Dominion tha-t some form of representation in the Dominion was desired.      On this basis, he suggested that no action need be taken as regards Australia, seeing that neither the Governor-General nor the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth appeared to favour any appointment in Australia, or as regards the Irish Free State, in view of the facts that the Governor-General wi-s averse from any proposal for British representation in the Free State and that Free State Ministers had not reverted to the matter since the Imperial Conference.     As regards the other Dominions, his suggestions were as follows:.-Canada.An officer should be appointed withemoluments approximating to those of &amp;Counsellor in the Diplomatic Service (assuming that, on financial grounds, it was consideredundesirable to send an officer of the status of a minister), who would be assisted by a juniorofficer with emoluments approximating to those ofa Second Secretary in the Diplomatic Service.-6-
Enquiry might be made of tLo Prime Minister of Canada whether it would he possible to provide office accommodation in the Canadian Government Offices,  on the analogy of the arrangement made in London in the case of the Australian Liaison Officer.      The duties of the principal representative would relate largely to foreign affairs hut his serv&amp;^s should he available to assist the Trade Commissioners in the manner proposed by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, should occasion arise. (2) . Hew Zealand.The request cf the Prime Minister of Hew Zealand for  the attachment to hi3 Depart-mont of a junior member of the Foreign Office staff,  for the purpose cf personal consultation and with no executive or administrative functions, should be complied with. (3)    Union of South Africa.The suggestion of. General Hertzog av:l General Smuts that the Imperial Secretary should bo the representative of the British Government in the Union should be adopted, but no additional appointment need be made. The Committee were generally in favour of proposals more of the character cf those put forward by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,  the Secretary cf State for Dominion Affairs explaining that he was in no way anxious to establish the liaison which he considered essential overseas on any ambitious scale, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer has ashed that it should be recorded that his assent thereto is subject to the
condition that the total coot of a Scheme of British       2 8 Representation in the Dominions as a whole,  inclusive of establishments and ether expenses,  shall not exceed  10,000 per annum in the aggregate.8.     Accordingly the Committee submit the following rcccmncndaticns to the Cabi nc t: -(a) That the Secretary cf State for Dominion Affairs should &quot;- d authorised to send forthwith an official reply to the Governor-General of ITew Zealand&apos;s telegram cf the 2nd June, 1927,tc the effect that the British Government concur in the proposals contained therein and will accordingly arrange for the appointment of a junior Member of the staff of the Foreign Office to the prime Minister&apos;s Department in ITev Zealand in a consultative or informative capacity but with nc executive or administrative functions, and in nc way representative cf the British Government in a diplomatic sense;    and that the British Government are prepared to pay his emoluments.(b) That the prime Minister should bo invited to take the opportunity of his forthcoming visit to Canada to confer informally with the Governor-General and the Prime Minister cf Canada on the specific proposals respecting British Representation in that Dominion outlined in paragraph 6 above, viz: That an Officer be appointed at Ottawa, representing the British Government.     The kind of arrangement discussed was (i) An Officer with status and emoluments equivalent to those of a Minister or Senior Counsellor in the Diplomatic Service, and (ii) a junior with status and emoluments equivalent
to thooo of a Second Secretary in the Diplomatic Service;    the British Government hepe that the Canadian Government will &quot;bo willing to provide office accommodation for the British Representative in one of their Departments at Ottawa.(c) That the financial bearing of the proposals (a) and (b) abov*e should be further examined by the Treasury,  the Dominions Office and the Forci-n Office in consultation.(d) That as regards the Union of South Africa,  the best arrangement would be for the Imperial Secretary to act ag the Representative of the British Governmentin South Africa.,  the details to be felt for discussion between the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the South African authorities, (c)    That,  for the present, no further action should be taken regarding British representation in the Commonwealth of Australia,  the Union cf South Africa (subject to  (d) above)  or the Irish Free State, but that the Secretary of State for Drminion Affairs should be at liberty to examine the question of British representation with the Australian and. South African authorities respectively should he find it necessary or desirable to do se during his forthcoming visits to those Dominions, and. report to the Cabinet.Signed on behalf of the Committee.BALFOUR.2, hhitehall Gardens,  8 .1&apos;/. 1., 16th July,  1927.CHAIRMAN.
s^p- f27)^- o a b i B a gCOMMITTSE ON TSfi RgPR^SSS TATIOH IH THE DQjteNIOMSm-jl m 0 R A H D U M by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.At the meeting of the Committee on the 22nd of June I promised to circulate a memorandum setting out my proposals on the subject of representation in Canada,  the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.    As was stated in the memorandum circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 140 (27), the form whioh suoh representation should take must necessarily depend on the varying circumstances of the different Dominions, and I propose therefore to deal separately with each of the Dominions mentioned above.Csnada.    Both the Governor General and the Prime Minister of Canada have advocated the appointment in Canada of a representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government In Great Britain analogous to the High Commissioner for Canada in London, and of a status at least equivalent to that of the newly appointed United States Minister at Ottawa.    Mr. Mackenzie King has also made it dear, when he was in this countr;/ at the time of the Imperial Conference,  that he would prefer to obtain information as to the policy of His MajsstyJs Government in Great.
Britain, supplementing our direct cables and despatches, from a representative of the British Government in Ottawa rather than by the development of a system of personal c-. tact in London.      I therefore recommend the appointment in Canada &apos;.f such a representative, responsible to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, who would be in a position to represent the policy of the British Government on all matters, particularly foreign affairs, questions affecting Inter-Imperial relations and defence.It was,  I think, the general feeling of the Committee that such a representative should not be regarded as in any way possessing authority over the Trade Commissioner Service in Canada, &quot;hut that,  should necessity arise,  it should be possible to utilise his services for the purpose of representations to Canadian Ministers on trade matters in cases where action by the Trade Commissioner seemed unlikely to prove efficacious.      It would be understood that he would only make representations in such matters if specially requested by the Chief Trade Commissioner or directly instructed by the British Government       I gather that, in present circumstances,  such cases are unlikely to be of frequent occurrence in Canada.As a considerable part of the duties of such an officer would consist of representing to the Canadian Government the views and policy of the British Government in foreign affairs,  there would be much to be said for the appointment to the post of an officer
3.0of the diplomatic service;    in that event, having regard to the personality and experience of the officer whom the United States Government have appointed as their Jfinister at Ottawa, it would he desirable that the officer should be someone holding the rank of a Minister.      On the other hand,  it was pointed out to the Committee that foreign affairs would be only one of the subjects with which our representative would have to deal, and a further consideration wes mentioned as indicating that it might be preferable, at any rate at the outset, not to appoint an officer of the diplomatic service, namely, the appointment of an officer of the diplomatic service might in 3orae quarters be regarded as suggesting that the relations between Great Britain and Canada were those of foreign countries.In the circumstances,  I am inclined to think that, as the first holder of such a post,  it would be best to appoint someone with wide general experience In public affairs, preferably including parliamentary experience and some knowledge of foreign affairs, and to attach to him as his chief assistant a member of the staff of the Foreign Office (or possibly the Dominions office).As regards the title of the post,  this should be commensurate with its status ;    in default of a better,  I would suggest &quot;High Commissioner for Great Britain in Canada&quot;.      It is,  I think,  essential that the proposed representative should not be described as British Minister or by any designation which would leave it open for the title British Minister to slip into popular use in Canada.
tibcy-Aav; aalth of Aus trail a.    The Govornor General of the Coujuonwealth is opposed to the suggestion of the appointment of a High Commissioner in Australia in view of its possible effect on the position of the Governor General. Mr. Bruce also does not appear to regard such an idea with favour, and is more interested in securing personal contact in this country.I am inclined tc think-&quot;that in the case cf Australia it would not be necessary to appoint at present a full High CGmmisf3ioner, such as is suggested above in the ease of Canada.       I suggest that, in the first instance, a political -officer should be appointed who would have duties somewhat similar to these of the Australian liaison officer in London.       Such an officer would be responsible to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and might be selected either from the staffs of the Foreign Office,  the Dominions Office or the Cabinet Offices,  or, possible, from outside the Government service.     His appointment should not affect in any way the position of the Trade Commissioners or 6f the present British Government Representative for Migration, but, as suggested above in the case of the proposed High Commissioner in Canada, it should be possible for him,  if specifically requested or instructed to that effect,  to make pa rsonal representations to Commonwealth Ministers on trade matters in cases where these were required to supplement action by the Trade Commissioners.     Such an arrangement, would, I gather, be welcomed by the President of the Board of Trade,
An opportunity for reviewing the position of the British Government Representative for Migration in relation to that of the political officer would be afforded when the tenure of office of the present holder cf the former post ccmes to an end.The political officer selected should, I think, have an assistant of junior standing, who might act for him (as far as possible) when he was travelling or on leave .Hew Zealand.     The position in Hew Zealand differs from that in the ease of the other Dominions, since the Hew Zealand Government dn not desire any change from the existing practice whereby the Governor General is the formal channel cf communication between the Government here and the Hew Zealand Government.    Mr.  Ooates1 wishes as regards the development of &quot;personal contact&quot; are shown clearly in the telegram from the Governor General of Hew Zealand of the 2nd June,  circulated -with Paper 3.R.D.  (2) - 2, i.e., in addition to appointing a liaison officer in London, he would like a member of the Foreign Office staff to be attached to his Department in Hew Zealand for the purpose of personal consultation, more particularly on matters relating to foreign affairs, but with no executive or administrative    function and in no sense a representative of the British Government in the diplomatic sense.     I recommend that this proposals, (which follows on discussions with Mr. Coates when ha was here last year) should be adopted, and that no further action as regards our representation in Hew Zealand should be taken for the time being.
Union of South Africa.    As the Committee are aware, the Governor General of the Union of South Afriaa is also High Commissioner for So-.:th Africa, and,  as such,  is concerned with the administration of the native territories of Basutolar Beehuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland, as well as possessing certain limited functions in relation to Southern Rhodesia. In this capacity he is assisted by an officer called the Imperial Secretary.    As will be seen from the Governor General&apos;s telegram of the 6th of June,, circulated with Paper B.R.D.   (27) 2, both General Hertzog and General Smuts would like the Imperial Seoretary to be representative in the Union of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Gr^at Britain, and the Governor General endorses this view.    If this proposal were adopted,  I think that it would be desirable that the Imperial Seoretary should have the assistance of an officer from the Foreign Office staff.A possible alternative would be that the High Commissions for South Africa should have two secretaries, one to deal with the purely South African matters with which the Imperial secretary at present deals, and the other to act as our representative vis-a-vis the Union Government in *inter-Imperial matters.Irish Free State.    We had not time at the Committee to disauss the position in the Irish Free State.    The Free State differs,  of course, from the other Dominions in view of its geographical proximity and the consequent facilities for personal discussion between the Ministers of the two Governments.    As was indioated in CP. 140 (27),  the Free State representatives at the Imperial Conference welcomed the idea of a High Commissioner,  but the Governor General has sinoe told me that he feels that such an appointment
2 Whitehall Gardens,  3.W.1,. 4 th July,  1927.might easily be subject to criticisms as an attempt to reassert our authority over the Free State.    This,  I gather, is Mr.. Eealy&apos;s personal view, and I am inclined to think that it wcull be best, by way of preliminary action,  to take st*;ps to ascertain Mr. Cosgrave1 s present views.I propose to circulate a separate note as to the probable cost of arrangements on the above lines.If the above proposals are approved in principle,   I suggest that in the case of flew Zealand an official reply might be sent forthwith to the Hew Zealand Government with reference t- the Governor General&apos;s telegram of the 2nd June. In the case of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Union of South Africa,  I should propose to take the opportunity of my forthcoming visits to those Dominions to discuss the matter with the Governors General a^office the Prime Ministers before it was raised officially with the Dominion Governments. In the ease of Canada,  I could do the same when I get there in January next, but it would,  I think be preferable if the Prime Minister himself could take the opportunity of his visit this summer to fix up matters informally with Lord Y/lllingdon and Mr. Mackenzie Ming.L.S.A.,.
