We have not at present been able to ascertain their exact effect but this is being worked out by Admiralty.At first sight it would not seem to us possible to accept the proposals exactly in this form but that with certain modifications they might be made the basis of a temporary arrangement terminating in or before 1936, provided that it is made clear that the limits so fixed for small cruisers are only a temporary expedient to secure a working arrangement for the next few years and not the acceptance of a principle that the needs of United States and ourselves for small cruisers are equal.I hope to communicate to you Cabinefs decisionon Wednesday^
