SECRET.Copy No.CP. 227/27.CABINET.CROWNLEASES IN  BRITISH CONCESSIONS IN CHINA.Note by the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.IN the absence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum prepared in the Treasury in rejoinder to the Foreign Office paper on the subject of the Crown leases in British concessions in China (CP. 226/27).August 23, 1927.The Treasury views on the arguments advanced in the Foreign Office memorandum may be summarised as follows: It must not be overlooked in any account of the historical origin of these concessions that the British Government (1) paid the market value of the land in the first instance when purchasing it for the most part from private owners, and (2) that it has regularly discharged its liabilitjr for land tax to the Chinese Government. Its legal title to the property is therefore as good as that of any other holders of land in China, and it holds the land on precisely the same terms as those on which every Consulate site is held.These facts must be emphasised since, vis-a-vis the various Chinese authorities with whom negotiations for the surrender of extra-territorial rights are conducted, they place the British Government in a strong legal position. The Foreign Office have circulated to the Treasury all the communications received from British representatives in China, and from these it is apparent that on different occasions Chen and Dr. Koo have not denied the British interest in the land. What Chen objected to was the continued retention of those interests. At Tien-tsin also Chang Tso Lin has been reported as not difficult over questions of detail.Reference is made&apos; in the Annex to the Foreign Office memorandum to the incident at Kiukiang, where the Chinese authorities attempted to avoid the acceptance of land tax, as a preliminary, it is presumed, to disputing the validity of the British Government&apos;s title. Unless the policy of the British Government is tamely to submit to any claim, however preposterous, some fractional Government in China chooses to put forward, it should not be difficult to repudiate the theory that the British Governments legal title has lapsed and has passed to certain Governments in China by virtue of their sovereign rights. If such a claim is to be conceded, it would be useless to purport to transfer to the concession holders the Governments interest in the land, as the Chinese would contend such interest did not in fact exist.The Treasury&apos;s view of China&apos;s attitude is that she objects, not altogether unreasonably, to the continued possession by a foreign Power of a freehold interest in important portions of her country. This she may regard as derogatory to her dignity, and recognising this view the British Government is prepared as early as possible to dispose of its interests by transfer to the concession holders or others for a very moderate consideration. On the information supplied to them the Treasury remains unconvinced that if the Chinese were firmly yet tactfully approached they could effectively object to such a settlement. How is China damnified, and where is the derogation from her sovereign rights if the British Government obtained money in respect of its own property from the Standard Oil or British-American Tobacco Companies for securing them a freehold instead of a leasehold?

corporations it might be a matter for serious consideration whether the British Government should not bargain with the Chinese to hand over to them a percentage of the receiptsAfter full consideration of the Foreign Office memorandum and of the despatches, &amp;o, from the British representatives in China, the Treasury is not satisfied that every plan for securing British interests has failed, or indeed that any serious and determined attempt has been made to come to terms with the Chinese authorities on the lines which the Treasury advocates. These are to approach the Chinese and tell them that the British Government is prepared to surrender mtxw  tuvritoiiiftl rights and to divest itself, in deference to their objection to its special position, as early as practicable of its reversionary interest in the land. In return for this the Chinese for their part are to be asked to recognise the validity of any transfer of British interests to other parties. When an agreement on these lines has been effected with the Chinese, the British Government would be in a position to transfer its reversionary interest to such of the lot-holders as are willing to accept its terms. A limit of time should be placed for such acceptance, and on its expiration the Government should be at liberty to sell its interest to the Chinese, to Banks, or to other parties.The Treasury does not accept the Foreign Office view that no lot-holder is likely to accept the terms offered. Messrs. Butterfield and Swire, one of the most important firms in China, have recently enquired the terms for purchase outright. These terms are very moderate. The 1927 lump sum valuation of the British reversionary interest is 7,311,000 dollars, and all that the lot-holders are to be asked to pay is 60 per cent, of this, viz., 4,386,600 dollars, say about  400,000. Such lot-holders as are not in a position to pay at once can be allowed to pay by instalments over a period of three to five years at 5 per cent, interest. In the view of the Foreign Office the Chinese would object to a system of annual instalments, but it is not clear why excessive attention should be paid to such an unreasonable objection. It should be mentioned in this connection that British lot-holders&apos; property represents only 61 -16 per cent, of the total value of the 7,311,000 dollars. The remaining 38 per cent, is held by-foreigners the Chinese percentage being 14-65 (mostly Customs property and Banks), the Japanese 6-89 per cent., American 5-89 per cent., and seven other nationalities smaller amounts.A comparatively minor point mentioned in the Foreign Office memorandum is the Crown Lease Renewal Reimbursement Fund at Tien-tsin. The Treasury is not satisfied that a solution cannot be found in this matter, or that it is of sufficient importance to modify the general policy for dealing with the British Governments reversionary interest in the Concessions.Finally, it should be borne in mind that to surrender the British reversionary interest as the Foreign Office suggests is tantamount to a gift of several hundreds of thousands of pounds, and in accordance with the undertaking given by the Treasury to the Public Accounts Committee in 1923, the proper procedure in a case such as this of a gift of public property is to lay a Minute before Parliament and not to implement the gift until fourteen days after the issue of the Minute. The adoption of the Foreign Office proposal involves a complete reversal of the decision come to in 1924 by the then Government after full consideration, and, although admittedly conditions in China have changed markedly since that date, the Treasury view is that unless successive deference is paid to every claim which the continually changing authorities in China see fit to put forward, the case has not been established for a complete sacrifice of the British taxpayers interest in the Concessions.
