[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1927.Copy No.   SOCABINET.DISARMAMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.LORD CECIL&apos;S resignation seems to me to have raised in an acute form the question of our attitude towards the problem of disarmament. Assuming that the Preparatory Commission meets in the autumn, our delegates will find themselves involved in a maze of complexities. Are we to tell them to cut their way out by the drastic method of bringing to an end discussions that, in their present form, are certainly premature and will probably prove abortive, or are they to try to recover something from the tangle into which the question has collapsed?Whilst it is easy to make an argument for the futility of the Conference, I take the view that the wise course for us to adopt is the course of friendly and cautious support rather than of open hostility or negative suspicion. Quite rightly, we have repeatedly said &quot; No &quot; to the several impracticable proposals for security that have been made by the League, and this or that Continental Government. Quite rightly, also, we were not prepared to endanger our naval security at the Geneva Conference. Justifiable, however, as our action has been, a continuously negative action, emphasized as it has been by Lord Cecil&apos;s resignation, is bound to leave the impression both at home and abroad that we are unsympathetic to the League&apos;s principles. The very fact that the Foreign Secretary has so effectively described the attitude of the Empire towards the League lends weight to my contention that, in the interests of both our domestic and foreign policy, we must not be manoeuvred into the false position of appearing to be hostile to the League. Here at home, the Opposition parties are evidently intending to exploit to the full the charge that we are reactionary and obscurantist, whilst abroad there seems the risk that the French of all people in the world will welcome the chance of shifting the charge of obstruc-tion from themselves to us.It is important without delay to block these possible lines of attack. I hope, therefore, that an early opportunity will be taken to explain still further the unaccountable character of Lord Cecil&apos;s resignation. I hope also that we shall still further emphasise our actual record in the matter of disarmament during the years since the armistice. This record cannot receive too great publicity. If I take, for instance, the case of air disarmament, I find that the French Air Force is still twice the size of our own; that French military air expenditure has more, than doubled since 1922; and that, although the franc has greatly appreciated, this expenditure has risen from 631,000,000 fr. in 1926 to 866,000,000 fr. in 1927, whilst the pro-visional estimates for 1928 allow for a further increase of 26 per cent. On the other hand, we have twice postponed the completion of our modest defence force; twice also Ave have reduced our estimates, once in 1926 by over  450,000, and again this year by nearly  900,000. Behind this contrast of air power there has stood out the even bigger contrast in the matter of general preparations for war. The Projets de Loi for the. reorganisation of French defence are designed to make the French Army far more formidable than it has even been before and to mobilize the whole nation in the event of war with a completeness that has nowhere been hitherto imagined. Is it not outrageous that in view of these facts we should be regarded as the black sheep in the disarmament pasture ?Thirdly, so far from putting any obstacle in the way of the Preparatory Corn-mission, I hope that we shall make it clear that we wish its labours to succeed and that, although the task appears almost insuperable, we shall honestlv try to obtain[16636]SECRET.CP. 234 (27).
some concrete result from its deliberations. If the Cabinet agree with this view, I suggest that it would be well to decide as soon as possible upon our line of action. It seems to me most important to avoid a drift that may unexpectedly bring us up against some formidable rock. Moreover, Lord Cecil&apos;s successor, whoever he may be, should be given as long a chance as possible for familiarising himself with the intricate details of the problem.What, then, is to be our attitude upon the three branches of disarmament when they come up for discussion in November? As to the two arms for which I am not responsible, I should rightly hesitate to make any definite proposals. I, therefore, restrict myself to asking certain questions that seem to me to demand an answer. So far as I understand the situation, the United States and we are both pledged to discuss naval disarmament. If this is the case, are we going to repeat what we said at Geneva in July and August ? In this event, will not the relations between the two countries, already sensitive after the Geneva failure, become seriously embittered ? If not, what new proposals do we intend to make, and would it not be wise to adopt a somewhat different policy from that which we followed in the case of the Coolidge Conference and to prepare the ground more fully by preliminary conversations ?How, again, do we propose, whilst maintaining the basic principle of security in naval strength, to avoid its being turned against us by the French in the case of land forces ?As to land forces, I understand that the chief question of divergence between us and the French, apart from the general problems of supervision and budgetary control that affect all three services, is whether or not trained reserves should be included in the calculation of armaments. There is good ground so to include them. Are we, however, to insist upon their inclusion at the risk of breaking down the Conference ?The question of air disarmament seems to have progressed during the spring-discussions somewhat further than the question of naval and military disarmament. Any progress, however, that was made was bought at the high price of complicating the problem with factory.that may upon further consideration prove insoluble. My view was always to keep the problem as simple and concrete as possible. The Air Staff, with the same object and with the support of the Committee of Imperial Defence, advocated a scheme for the restriction of first line military machines, namely, of such machines as could be easily defined and could almost without warning wreak havoc in the great centres of European population. Lord Cecil by his insistence compelled us to add to this basis of comparison the additional calculation of horse-power. Whilst I believe that in practice it will be exceedingly difficult to deal with horse-power, I am prepared to accept the position as it was left in the spring and to try to make the best of it. I would, however, once again emphasize the strength of our earlier position, in which we were comparing like with like and were dealing with easily definable units. If, as I hear, the French are now reconsidering their policy and are beginning to wonder Avhether it -&quot;s not better to take one step at a time, and that the most simple step, I hope that we shall do everything in our power to help them on their way. The problem of air disarmament is extraordinarily technical and, owing to the similarity at this stage of development of certain characteristics of both military and civil aircraft and the divergence of opinion as to the potential value of the latter for military roles, even more complicated than the naval and military problems. If, therefore, progress is to be made at the Preparatory Commission, it is vitally important to avoid unnecessary details and imponderabilia of every kind. Indeed, the more I think of the question and its complexities, the more I revert to my conviction that the only effective way of restricting air armaments is by means of a tri-partite agreement between the three Great Air Powers of Western Europe, France, Italy and ourselves. Would it not be possible for preliminary talks to be set in train between the three Governments with a view to seeing whether agreement upon some such basis as equality could not be reached ? It does not seem to me necessary to postpone conversations of this kind until the League discussions are ended. The League discussions will never end, and I am inclined to think that they Avill progress far more satisfactorily if some basis of agreement has been reached in the meanwhile between the three Great Air PoAvers.But whether or not it is decided to commence conversations of this kind, it is equally important to do what we can to get some result out of the League&apos;s discussions. We must, of course, remain firm upon any ground that it is necessary for us to hold for national security.    We must remain opposed to international
supervision and international budgetary control. Short, however, of the ground that we must hold, there is still scope for manoeuvre and for winning actual advantage for the British Empire. Publicity, whether in the matter of material, personnel or expenditure, provided that it does not impinge upon secret mobilisation data, inventions and appliances, should be a gain rather than a loss to us. If a further step can be taken and a restriction put upon further competition in naval, land or air armaments, this country with its clean record in the matter of military policy and its great dependence -upon commerce, peace and public economy, will be the chief gainer. Moreover, let us not ignore the shorter view, and remember that it will be most unfortunate for the Conservative Party if we are manoeuvred by our opponents into a purely negative position, and are regarded by many men and women who are not attached to any party as being hostile to the League and the principles for which it stands.S. H.Air Ministry, October 6, 1927.
