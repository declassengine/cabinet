DRAFT TELEGRAM TO GENEVA, FOR CONSIDERATION AT A MSB TINS- OF THE CABINET TO BE HELD OH THURSDAY t AUGUST 4, 192.7, tit 12 Noon.The Cabinet have considered v/neth9r a temporarymodus Vivendi is possible on the basis of the Japaneseproposal which &quot;would not involve the final abandonment of the principle of the 6&quot; gun, on the eventualadoption of which we still think any real reductionof armaments depends.    The conditions of any suchoompromise clearly are that -1*    It should not last beyond 1931.    This is already provided for in the Japanese proposalc2.    We should retain the right to complete our existing programme of construction, as approved &quot;by the Cabinet.    It must be made clear, therefore, that &quot;authorised programme&quot; bears this meaning.3.    Number of small 8n gun Cruisers mast be limited as a separate class^    For this reason, and also because we cannot admit possibility of the United States building 8&quot; gun Cruisers against our existing 6&quot; , wording of first paragraph of Article 3 must be modified somewhat as follows:-&quot;United States to undertake that, at no period before December 31, 1931, her auxiliary naval strength 6hall exceed that of British Empire in any class of ship defined in this Agreement&quot; ?and Agreement must contain a provision defining the class of small 8&quot; gun Cruiser&quot;as well as 10sOOO-ton 8&quot; class and 6&quot; olass.    The definition of the small 811 gun Cruiser olass should be on lines approximately similar to &quot;YORK&quot;.On the above basis we do not see any useful purpose would be served by including seoond paragraph
Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, August 3, 1927.of Article 3, and we think this should be omitted.We cannot accept Article 4.    On the contrary in return for, and as a condition of, this great and, in our opinion, most unhappy, though in the circumstances inevitable, concession to the American demand for Cruisers 6f large tonnage and heavy oalibre of gun, we must ask that Americans will oonsent to include in modus vivendi points in regard to smaller auxiliary vessels (Destroyers and Submarines) on which substantial agreement has already been reached, and also will consent to limit Capital Ships as proposed by us.The Agreement should be concluded by a declaration as in the last paragraph cf your telegram No. 224 L. N.
