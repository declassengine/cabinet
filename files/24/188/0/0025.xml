The Treaty of Nanking of 1842 the first treaty between England and China  stipulated that British merchants could reside and trade at certain treaty ports, and that the local officials in consultation with the British consul should set aside land and houses for their use. The first British settlement was thus set aside at Shanghai in 1845, but at that time there was no thought that His Majesty&apos;s Government should embark on a policy of speculating in land in a foreign country in order to enable British merchants to enjoy a privilege conferred by treaty. British merchants purchased what land they required direct from the native owners in the reserved area, but, as other nations had the same treaty rights as ourselves, it was found that there was no means of preventing other nationals purchasing land in the same area. There was no means of enforcing British regulations on such nationals, and therefore the only way of saving the settlement as a settlement was to allow it to become an International Settlement. At other ports, the chief of which were Hankow and Tien-tsin, our representatives in China sought for some means of avoiding the serious difficulties that had been experienced in Shanghai. They hit upon the plan of persuading the Chinese officials to lease the whole area of the settlement direct to the British Government, who were thus able to sub-lease it in lots as required to British merchants and exclude other nationals, unless they bound themselves to obey our regulations. The consul having paid the agreed price to the local officials entered into possession of the land, in one instance, at least, by the use of armed force, and proceeded to divide the &apos;: concession &quot; into lots of convenient size, which were leased to the British merchants on ninety-nine-year Crown leases  a form of tenure unknown to Chinese law or custom. As the price obtained for the leases was considerably higher than that paid for the freehold, a profit of no less than  50,000 was realised on the initial transactions in the six concessions, while subsequent transactions have also from time to time as occasion offered yielded a substantial profit. That is the origin of the British Government^ speculation in land in China. It is hardly conceivable that had the matter been submitted for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government any Cabinet would ever have sanctioned embarking upon so dangerous a course. The decisions were taken by the Departments concerned, and His Majesty&apos;s Government thus drifted into an extraordinary position which has no parallel in any other country in the world; but everything in China is abnormal; the speculation turned out to be a lucky one, and no one ever thought of examining or questioning the position until within the last dozen years the rise of the Nationalist movement in China and the wider knowledge which the Chinese had gained of international affairs caused a searchlight to be thrown on the many extraordinary privileges which foreigners in that country enjoyed. About the same time the approach of the date when the Crown leases -would fall in raised the question of the terms on which they should be renewed. Sir John Jordan, who was then British Minister in Peking, immediately sounded a note of warning. He pointed out that a time was soon coming when the Chinese could no longer be expected to acquiesce in a situation which allowed an alien Government to derive a profit for the benefit of its own taxpayers from the exploita-tion of an extra-territorial privilege granted for a wholly different purpose.3.   The Office of Works, with the support of the Treasury, took the view that the Crown&apos;s ownership of the soil of the British concessions in China should be treated on a purely commercial basis, and that Crown leases in Tien-tsin should be dealt with on the same basis as Crown leases in Regent Street.    They therefore 4090   f165351 b
proposed to renew the present ninety-nine-year leases for 999 years on terms which would yield a considerable annual profit to the Crown. This policy was opposed by the -Foreign Office on the ground that a time was soon coming when China would no longer tolerate a state of affairs which allowed a foreign Government to exploit for the benefit of its own taxpayers an extra-territorial privilege granted for a wholly different purpose under the provisions of what the Chinese describe as the unequal treaties. In 1924 the dispute was referred to the Cabinet, who decided that the Crown lease renewal scheme should be carried into effect. The Nationalist movement, aiming at the cancellation of all such extra-territorial privileges, subsequently developed with even greater rapidity than had been anticipated, with the result that when, in January of this year, the British concession at Hankow was seized by the Chinese, by a combination of violence and trickery, a beginning had not yet been made with the renewal of the Crown leases under the scheme elaborated by the Office of Works.4. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which had just previously been publicly announced in the memorandum of the 18th December, 1926, addressed to the Washington Powers, was to grant whatever could reasonably and safely be conceded to the just demands and legitimate aspirations of Nationalist sentiment in China. It was conceived that this was the only policy which could prevent the total destruction of the extensive British interests in China. The recovery of the foreign concessions alien enclaves on Chinese soil from which Chinese sovereignty was almost entirely excluded occupied a prominent place in the programme of the Nationalist party, and it was accordingly one of the principal objects of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to effect such a modification of the constitution and status of British concessions in China as would remove any legitimate grievances that the Chinese might have on this score.5. The difficult task of giving effect to this policy at Hankow after the concession had actually passed into the hands of the Chinese was greatly complicated by the impossibility of reconciling the retention by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the position of ground landlord of the concession lots with the restoration&apos; of the concession to Chinese sovereignty. Our representatives in China repeatedly urged that it would, in fact, be found impossible to secure the reversionary interest of the Crown, that any attempt to do so might lead to endless friction with the Chinese authorities in future, and that the surrender of the Crown&apos;s reversionary interest should be arranged before any agreement validating the rendition of the concession to Chinese control was signed, as otherwise our hands would be forced and we should be compelled to surrender the reversion in much more unfavourable circumstances later on.In view of the Cabinet decision referred to above, the Foreign Office set aside the urgent representations of Sir Miles Lampson, and every effort was made to realise the Crown&apos;s reversionary interest in the concession leases. In order not to overburden this memorandum the various plans put forward and the reasons for their failure are set out in a separate memorandum annexed hereto.6. Negotiations at Hankow were actually in progress while these plans were under discussion. Faced with the necessity of bringing these negotiations to an early conclusion the question of the Crown&apos;s ownership of the land was reserved for future consideration, and the Chen-0&apos;Malley Agreement, signed on the 19th February, merely provided that the certificate of title to land issued by the Municipal Bureau should be additional and parallel to the Crown leases.7. The Treasury and Office of Works became convinced in the course of these discussions that it was no longer possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to retain the ownership of the soil of the concessions and to draw an annual revenue from the concession lot-holders for the benefit of the taxpayer in England. They therefore abandoned the former Crown lease renewal scheme and substituted instead a sale outright scheme hoping that by the offer of attractive terms the lot-holders could be persuaded to purchase outright the head leases of their respective lots. In spite of the failure of this plan (see annex, paragraph 3), they still maintain the view that &quot;the primary and vital point is to secure absolutely the legal and financial interest of the Government.&quot; They appear to believe that the legal and financial interest of the Crown has been fully secured by the arrangement made at Hankow (see paragraph 6 above), and that it would be similarly secured at Tien-tsin by-obtaining &quot;firm assurances&quot; from Chang Tso-lin and by &quot;informing him &quot;that it is assumed that he will, as an honourable man, continue to recognise the perpetual title of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;  At Hankow His MajestyV&quot;Government, it is true,
3212are still nominally the legal owners of the reversion, and it is conceivable that they might continue to retain the legal ownership of the reversion in Tien-tsin; but as His Majesty&apos;s Government can only make good their claim to the reversion with the cordial co-operation oi the Chinese authorities (which is notoriously lacking), their titie to the reversion, though valid in law, is valueless; no one will pay even the smallest sum for it since His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot guarantee security of tenure (see annex, paragraph 3 (a) and (b)). Even assuming that Chang Tso-lin could be induced to give *&quot; firm assurances-&apos; as proposed by the Treasury, there is no ground for the belief that such assurances from a factional leader, who is hinlself the object of Nationalist attack, would possess any greater sanctity than the much more solemn international agreements which are daily flouted with complete impunity when it i^ considered that they impinge upon China&apos;s sovereign rights.8. At Hankow the opportunity to obtain perpetual titles for the lot-holders has been lost. Just beyond the borders of the concession British merchants hold their land on good perpetual titles, but inside the concession, which their enterprise has done so much to develop, they are left with titles with only thirty-three years to run and without any protection against the. Chinese authorities. The sole purpose of this arrangement was to leave His Majesty&apos;s Government in possession of a reversion which the lot-holders know to be valueless, and it is not surprising, therefore, that they feel with some bitterness that their interests have been gratuitously sacrificed. At Hankow the sacrifice of the lot-holders was perhaps inevitable, but it is not open to us to adopt a similar course in the concession agreement now under negotiation at Tien-tsin. In order to secure, the successful working of any such agreement, the first essential must be to secure the willing co-operation of the British community in Tien-tsin. It would, in particular, be fatal to antagonise the Crown lessees, who are the most influential section of that community, and to whom in the main we should look to supply the British members of the mixed Municipal Council which the agreement would propose to set up.9. A further difficulty peculiar to Tien-tsin is caused by the Crown Lease Renewal Reimbursement Fund. In 1018 the British concession at Tien-tsin and its two extensions, which had previouslv been under separate administrations, were amalgamated into one British municipal area. His Majesty&apos;s Government felt then, just as they feel now, that it would not be right to effect an alteration in the status of the British concession over the heads of the lot-holders and without their consent. The Crown lessees of the original British concession would have had a legitimate grievance if they had been forced to amalgamate without some compensation for the difference in land tenure between ninety-nine-year Crown leases in the concession and perpetual Chinese titles in the extensions. Their consent to the amalgamation of the three areas in 1918 was procured by making provision in the regulations (article 12) for a Crown Lease Renewal Reimbursement Fund to be raised by means of a tax levied over the whole area. It was expressly stipulated that this fund should continue until the year 1960. Such a tax, the proceeds of which ultimately go into the pockets of the taxpayer in England, cannot continue to be levied after the return of the concession to Chinese sovereignty. If the reversion of the Crown leases were surrendered to the lot-holders, that would solve the difficulty. No other practicable solution has been suggested.10. If the Tien-tsin concession negotiations are delayed or brought to a stand-still owing to some legal dispute between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Crown lessees, it would inevitably cause serious friction with the Chinese, culminating possibly in a catastrophe similar to that which led to the loss of the British concession at Hankow. On the other hand, if these negotiations are pushed to a successful conclusion, this would carry out a substantial instalment of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the resultant agreement might well become a landmark in the history of Sino-British relations. It seems therefore worth while to make a considerable sacrifice in order to clear the road for the conclusion of such an agree-ment. The Foreign Office view is that, in order to avoid these dangers and to attain these objects of high policy, His Majesty&apos;s Government should make an immediate sacrifice of their reversionary interest in the concession leases, and they believe that this sacrifice would be more apparent than real, because the reversionary interest is, in fact, incapable of realisation.11. The courses that are open to His Majesty&apos;s Government may be summarised as follows: (1.) To conclude no agreement at Tien-tsin. *This would involve abandoning our whole China policy. [16535] b 2
(2.) To conclude an agreement in which, as at Hankow, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment remained in possession of the reversion with a view to subsequent realisation.The reversion would be valueless; we should be involved in perpetual friction with the Chinese; the lot-holders would be left with insecure titles; their resentment would make it impossible to carry the agree-ment into effect; and the result would be the same as in No. 1.(3.) To surrender the reversion to the Chinese, stipulating for fair treatment of the lot-holders on the expiry of their leases.This is a possible solution, but the Foreign Office do not advocate it as such action would be bitterly criticised; the agreement might be jeopardised for the reasons set out in No. 2, and with the same result.(4.) To grant perpetual titles to the Crown lessees in Tien-tsin before the agree-ment is concluded.This is the course which the Foreign Office recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt.12. The agreement which is now in sight in Tien-tsin promises to provide a complete solution of a dangerous and intricate problem. Unfortunately, further progress is blocked by the attitude taken up by the Treasury and Office of Works, who refuse to believe that the Crown&apos;s reversionary interest has no realisable value. The Foreign Office believe that the eaily conclusion of the Tien-tsin Agreement is vital to the success of their policy in China. The whole object of the policy to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed by the memorandum of the 18th December and the proposals of the 28th January is to make it possible to protect our vital interests in China by abandoning unnecessary and indefensible privileges which are a source of weakness and of friction with the Chinese. To reverse this policy would, it is believed, be a grave error, but to allow it to be reversed merely on the ground that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot consent to be deprived even of a slender chance of making still further profits out of what had proved a lucky speculation in the past would lay His Majesty&apos;s Government open to very serious criticism, especially on the part of those who have suffered so heavily in the recent disorders in China.Foreign Office, August 17, 1927.Annex.Proposed Plans for securing the Crown&apos;s Reversionary Interest in the ConcessionLeases.1. It was suggested that the Chinese Government might be asked to issue a perpetual lease in the name of each Crown lessee, such deed of perpetual lease to be handed to His Majesty&apos;s consul, who would transfer it to the lessee after the latter had bought out the interest of the Crown.This was found to be impossible because (a.) It required the cordial co-operation of both the leaseholders and the Chinese authorities.(p.) The future being so much in doubt, no leaseholder would pay unconditionallyany sum, however small, for the Crown&apos;s interest, (c.) Even if leaseholders were willing to buy the reversions, they could only paythe sum demanded by the Crown in annual instalments. (d.) This would mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government, after rendition, would continue to draw an annual revenue from the concession, (e.) The Chinese would certainly object to (d), and a time would come when theannual payments could only be enforced by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentappearing as plaintiff in a Chinese court, to which there are obvious objections.2. As an alternative to 1, it was suggested that the perpetual leases might be issued in the name of a nominal syndicate, specially formed for the purpose of holding the interests of the Crown instead of to each Crown lessee.
Foreign Office, August 17, 1927.Sir M. Lampson pointed out that the fact that the nominal syndicate was acting for the Crown could not be concealed, and the plan, besides being open to the same objections as plan No. 1, would arouse the deepest suspicions.3. Consideration of the above proposals having convinced the Treasury and Office of Works that it was impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government, after rendition of the concessions, to continue to draw an annual revenue from the lot-holders, they agreed that the Crown lease renewal scheme should be definitely abandoned in favour of a sale outright scheme. A greatly reduced price would be asked for the head lease of each lot in order to induce all the lot-holders, or a substantial majority of them, to agree immediately to purchase the Crown&apos;s reversionary interest. This price was eventually fixed on the basis of a reduction of 40 per cent, on the valua-tions of concession lots made in 1922, thus eliminating the value of the buildings on the lots. This plan also failed for reasons which are substantially the same as those which frustrated the previous proposals. They may be summarised a follows : (a.) Even a reduced price could only be paid iu instalments (see 1 (c),(d) and (e) ).(6.) While there could be no objection to His Majesty&apos;s Government acting as trustee of the reversion for the benefit of the lessees, the Chinese authorities would undoubtedly deny their right to transfer the reversion for a valuable consideration on the ground that this would constitute a financial exploitation of the treaty right of residence. This is clearly shown by the following facts : During the Chen-0&apos;Malley negotiations the more Mr. Chen considered the point as to the ownership of the land by His Majesty&apos;s Government, &quot; the more difficulty he found in swallowing it.&apos;&apos; The question &quot;caused him much anxiety,&quot; but he eventually agreed to drop the matter for the time being to enable the concession agreement to be concluded. In the case of the Tien-tsin negotiations the Chinese delegates in Peking proposed an amendment which amounted to a claim that the Chinese Government should replace His Majesty&apos;s Government as regards the reversionary interest in the Crown leases and the fact that there were Chinese among the Crown lessees had not escaped their notice. More recently, in Kiukiang, the Chinese authorities have showed their intention to dispute the validity of His Majesty&apos;s Governments reversionary title by attempting to refuse acceptance of the land tax annually paid to them by His Majesty&apos;s consul in respect of the concession lots.(c.) In view of the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government can only make good their claim to the reversion with the cordial co-operation of the Chinese authorities (which the evidence quoted above shows to be notoriously lacking), no lot-holder is willing to pay unconditionally even the smallest sum for the purchase of the reversion because they cannot be assured of a secure tenure. Some lot-holders would like to purchase this reversion with a view to being in possession of a perpetual title before the status of the concessions is altered, but they would only do so under conditions which provided for a return of their money in the event of the Chinese Government not recognising their title, or in the event of other lessees, even up to the date of the expiry of the leases in 1960, obtaining perpetual titles on more favourable terms.- The sale of a few titles on such terms would only add to the difficulties of the present situation and increase the possibility of friction with the Chinese authorities.
