CABINET.SECRET. _CP. 229(27).EXTENSION OP THE FRANCHISE TO COMPANIES.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.When considering the question of equal franchise for men and women, the Equal Franchise Committee took the view that the question of giving votes to representatives of public Companies and of changes in the local government franchise would, among other matters,  require careful examination by the Committee and ultimately by the Cabinet.    As it has now been decided that a Bill for equalizing the franchise as between men and women shall be Introduced next session,  it is now for the Cabinet to decide whether the Bill shall Include provisions for conferring the franchise, whether parliamentary or local government or both,  on Companies.In April last I circulated to my colleagues a memorandum (CP.179 (26) ) summarising briefly the chief considerations for and against the proposal contained in a Bill presented by Colonel Vaughan-Morgan to confer the local government franchise upon Mercantile Corporations and Companies.    Owing to the General Strike this Bill did not come on for Second Reading but a Bill In identical terms was again introduced in February last and was the subject of a brief discussion on Second Reading (see Official Report,  vol. 202,  cols. 2125 - 2140).    No Division was taken and no statement of the Government&apos;s attitude towards the principle embodied in the Bill was made.As indicated in the above mentioned memorandum, I am personally in favour of the principle of Colonel Vaughan-Morgan&apos;s Bill.    It is in my view inequitable that Companies who pay a great proportion of the rates should have no voice in the election of a
local authority and therefore no check on its expenditure.    It is true that a single vote gives an individual   Company only a small power of control, but the aggregate votes of all the Companies in a local government area may exercise an important and restraining influence.The case for conferring the parliamentary franchise on Companies is less strong,  since the individual shareholders will in nearly every case be in a position to influence questions of national policy by their possession of separate parliamentary votes, whereas their local government votes, if any, will generally be exercisable in areas other than those where the premises of the Company are situated.    It is also easier to criticise the wider proposal on tho grounds that it would bo impossible for the nominee of a Company to represent in any proper sense tho conflicting political views of the shareholders, and that an added incentive would be given to the conversion of all kinds of businesses into limited Companies.    These considerations do not apply with the same force to the local government franchise. /?I personally, however, -shall- be disposed to put Companies on the same footing for both parliamentary and local government purposes.If it is decided in principle to extend tho franchise to Companies it will bo necessary to consider whether it should be limited to Companies which are bona fide formed for and engaged in actual trade or commerce or whether it should be extended to any lawfully constituted Association or Corporation.    It is obviously inappropriate to include local authorities Avithin the scope of any, such proposal and it is for consideration whether public bodies such as the Metropolitan Water Board or the Port of London Authority, which are composed wholly or largely of the representatives of local authorities, should be included, but, subject to this I should be in favour of a wide definition of f Company&apos;,
-3- 224A further question is whether there should be any condition as to the value or rating of the premises occupied&apos; Under Colonel Vaughan-Morgan&apos;s Bill a Company, to qualify for the local government franchise, would have had to be in possession of property of the yearly value of  25 and to be rated.    No such conditions apply, however,  to the existing individual local government franchise and they appear to me to be unnecessary.    In the case of the parliamentary franchise, for the purpose of the &quot;business premises qualification&quot; the land or premises occupied must be of the yearly value of not less than  10, and the position of Companies might be assimilated to that of individuals.As regards the machinery of registration and voting,  I do not anticipate any difficulty.    I contemplate, however, that it would be left to each Company to take the necessary action by making claims for the purpose  (in a form to be prescribed) in respect of premises in their occupation&quot;    I do not think it would be reasonable to require the Registration Officers to search out .: the Companies entitled to be registered as they are now required to do in the case of individuals.It would further be essential that the name to appear in the register should be that of the authorised officer of the Company  (who ^ould have to be a British subject) and not that of the Company,  and in order to apply to Company representatives the existing procedure for the prevention of plural voting, one and the same person should bo registered for all Company premises in the area of each local authority.v7. J.H.1st August,   1927.
