CABINET.RUBBER EXPORTS RESTRICTION SCHEME.Memorandum by the Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE regulations now governing the export of rubber from Ceylon and Malaya came into force on the 1st November, 1926. The official announcement publishing the regulations stated that &quot;it is not contemplated that any change shall be made in these regulations for a period of twelve months at least, but if it is decided at the end of that time to continue the temporary policy of restriction for a further period, any changes in the regulations which may then be considered desirable may be made.&quot; Pressure has since been brought to bear on the Secretary of State to promise a definite period of notice either of the withdrawal of the regulations or of any change in them, but he has not committed himself further than to say in an answer in the House that, if any change in the scheme were to become necessary, he would endeavour to give as long notice as possible. After receiving further representations from American and British interests, the Secretary of State said in reply to a question on the 20th July last: &quot;In present circumstances I do not contemplate either the withdrawal of the scheme or any alteration in the pivotal price on which it is based,or any other substantial variation in its provisions.....I repeat that ....so long as the conditions under which the present scheme is operating remain substantially the same, I do not propose to suggest any material modification in its provisions. I am not aware that any such alteration has taken place in those conditions (since February 1927).&quot; He added that, without binding himself, he contemplated that the notice given of any change in the scheme &apos;&apos; would certainly be a matter of months.&quot;I think it is not generally realized that the existing regulations continue in force until there is a definite announcement of some change, of which, as it will be seen, due notice must be given. There is an urgent demand that the Government should state its intentions with regard to the scheme after the 1st November next. The market is in an unsatisfactory condition and holders of large stocks are nervous. I agree that it is important that some definite announcement should be made as soon as possible.   Some announcement must be made before the 1st November.There is no doubt that the present position of the Restriction Scheme is unsatisfactory. How far it could be improved by any practicable alteration of the regulations is another question. The Secretary of State&apos;s Advisory Committee have made certain suggestions, of which I attach a copy. The most important altera-tion proposed is that the percentage of standard production which may be exported at the minimum rate of duty shall be reduced from 60 to 50 as from the 1st February, 1928, if the average price of rubber has not reached Is. Qd. on that date, and shall be kept at 50 so long as the price does not average Is. Qd. over the preceding quarter. It is now round about Is. id. Such an announcement might have a psychological effect on the market for the moment, but, so far as I can judge from the information available at present, I doubt whether the further restriction proposed would suffice during the course of a year to clear off the surplus stocks now in London and so materially affect the amount of rubber available for the market, or would indeed have any considerable effect save to increase the amount of rubber drawn from foreign territory not under restriction. We shall be better able to judge when we have the considered statement of figures which the Advisory Committee are preparing. A reduction to 50 per cent, would receive unofficial support in Malaya, but it seems to me that any alteration in the scheme is in itself undesirable and should only be introduced if it can be shown that it will produce the desired effect and that that effect cannot be obtained better by other means, as in this instance I am inclined to think it can.[16673]SECRET. Copy No.      OqCP. 241 (27).
In any case it is essential that the local Governments should be fully consulted as to the practicability and probable effects of the proposed change, before so impor-tant an alteration in the scheme is adopted. In view, therefore, of the urgent need of an early announcement, I propose to defer consideration of this recommendation and not to mention it in the notice which must be issued as soon as possible this month. It will, I think, suffice for the moment to announce that no change will be made as from the 1st November next.The fifth recommendation of the Committee is that the methods of assessment shall be thoroughly overhauled. I agree with this recommendation and I am in communication with the local Governments about it. All my information goes to show that most estates are assessed on a generous scale, ana that a drastic over-hauling of the methods of assessment should be more effectual than any alteration of the percentage, which, inter alia, is an incentive to smuggling, though I admit it will be a difficult process. There is the further advantage that we are at all times free to improve our methods of assessment without any obligation as to notice, and without any alteration of the scheme.It may be convenient to recall that the percentage of export is based on &quot; standard production.&quot; In Malaya the standard production of estates over 25 acres in area is based on a stated allowance per acre according to the age of the trees, varying from 60 lbs. an acre for trees 5 years old, to 300 lbs. an acre for trees-S years old or more. In the case of estates under 25 acres an assessment of 400 lbs. an acre is allowed for mature trees, and half that amount for trees in bearing but not mature. In Ceylon standard production is assessed on much the same lines, save that the maximum rate of assessment may be higher in cases in which satisfactory proof of a higher normal rate of production is forthcoming. Assessment is a difficult and highly technical business. Allowances have to be made for several factors which can only be estimated by men who have an intimate knowledge of the local planting conditions. There are also great difficulties in dealing with small-holders and native production. The matter is not one which can be dealt with at this end save in the most general way, but given the co-operation of the local representatives of the industry of which the interests are at stake, I believe that a considerable degree of tightening of restriction can be effected without injury to individual estates and without the attendant disadvantages of a reduction of the percentage. I have therefore incorporated in the draft of the notice to be issued immediately a statement that the local Governments will be asked to overhaul the machinery of the scheme with a view to increasing the efficiency of its working.I annex the draft of the notice which I propose to issue. It will be seen that it does not commit us to any alteration of the scheme, while reserving the right to make alterations as from the 1st February if on further consideration they appear desirable.As regards the other recommendation of the Committee, approval has already been given for the adoption of the proposal No. 4, which is not of much practical importance and need not, I think, be announced. It does not affect the period of validity of the coupon.As &quot; unused coupons &quot; are sometimes blamed for the failure of the Restriction scheme to reduce production to the level of consumption, I should like to explain the position. In Malaya the export of estate rubber, roughly 70 per cent, of the whole, is regulated by means of entries in the Customs books, not by coupons. The exporter is credited at the beginning of each quarter with his quota. He can make up any deficit up to the end of the next quarter. After that his right to export the deficit lapses. The remaining 30 per cent, from small holdings and native produce is exported on production of a coupon which is issued quarterly. It was recently proposed to restrict the period of validity of coupons issued after a certain date, but the High Commissioner has satisfied me&apos;that the proposal was impracticable and it has been abandoned. The local export Committee are satisfied that surplus coupons are not now, and are not likely to be, accumulated.In Ceylon rubber from all sources is exported by means of coupons. A Bill to limit the period of validity of coupons was introduced but had to be withdrawn owing to strong opposition in the Legislative Council. The quantity exported from Ceylon is roughly one-fifth of that exported from Malaya.Smuggling is another scapegoat. It is, of course, impossible to give any reliable estimate of the extent to which smuggling is an appreciable factor in the situation. The present High Commissioner is giving much attention to the subject. He has put forward proposals for dealing with smuggling which would involve a departure from
our accepted policy as regards territorial waters and the high seas. They are to be discussed with the Foreign Office and the Admiralty, but I doubt whether it will be possible to accept them.The Stevenson scheme has undoubtedly justified itself when viewed as a measure to meet the crisis at the time of its inception, when there was a real risk of the Malayan rubber industry passing from British to American hands at break-up prices. The present position is less satisfactory, and, in my opinion, it is very doubtful whether any tinkering with the regulations will be a remedy. The raising of the pivotal price from Is. 3d. to Is. this time last year appeared reasonable at the time and undoubtedly has kept the stocks at present held below what they would have been otherwise, but has done little permanent good. Not that 1 wish to suggest an alteration of the pivotal price at present. The consequences might be very serious. But we cannot deny that the Is. 9rf. price gives a certain air of unreality to the whole scheme, which is not good for the prestige of British administration. Local difficulties in working tend to accumulate. There is now a serious risk of political danger arising out of the jealousies of the large and small holders and the continual possibility of political friction in Ceylon. Any radical alteration of the scheme such as would involve legislation always forces us to chose between a conflict with the legislature in Ceylon or differential treatment of two British rubber-producing countries.Restriction was, and is, admittedly a temporary expedient. At the outset the anticipation was that it would have produced its effect and disappeared some time before the expiration of the five or six years required for newly-planted rubber trees to come into bearing. Restriction has now lasted for five years, and, although rubber can be produced at a reasonable profit, we cannot say that the scheme has either stabilized the price or brought the quantity of rubber produced down to the level of the world&apos;s consumption. Some figures which appeared in the &quot; Times &quot; of the 26th September, 1927, are instructive in this respect: Year.	Production.	Consumption	Malaya and 1 Ceylon Exports.

I hope shortly to have agreed figures with regard to both. Meanwhile, I would draw serious attention tothe fact that under the scheme control of the rubber situation is steadily and necessarily slipping out of our hands. When restriction started the proportion of rubber produced on British territory was over 70 per cent. It is now, I understand, not much above 50 per cent. Every lightening of the screw must inevitably tend still further to reduce our proportion. Even taking into account British-owned estates in the Dutch East Indies, the adherence of which to the scheme is purely voluntary, it is evident that at this rate there must come a time when the gain to British interests and the consequent effect on the American exchange of a higher price for rubber will be more than offset by the loss of profit on rubber not sold owing to restriction and the diversion of American payments for rubber to foreign pockets, mainly Dutch.There is also, I fear, some truth in the criticism that the restriction scheme keeps alive inferior and inefficient estates at the expense of those which could produce rubber at competitive prices. For a time it was justifiable to do this, but the longer the process continues the more difficult it becomes to defend it on economic-grounds.We have hitherto fenced with criticism on these lines. I have reason to know that it will be strongly urged in Parliament next session, and I anticipate some difficulty in meeting the demand for an independent and comprehensive enquiry into the whole subject.   We cannot much longer avoid facing the question what is
to be the end of it all, and how, when the time comes, we are to get out of restriction with the minimum of damage to British interests. For these reasons I have thought it desirable to bring to the notice of the Cabinet the grounds on which I personally feel uneasy about the whole situation. Not that I advocate the early suspension of the scheme. The opportunity to suspend it was when rubber was at high prices last year. That opportunity was not taken, and there is, I think, general agreement that, in the absence of some unforeseen development, restriction could not well be removed or suspended except when the price of rubber was rising steadily. Further suspension or withdrawal without long notice would be as incompatible with the understandings which exist, and the undertakings which have been given, as any fundamental alteration would be. So long as the conditions remain as at present a considerable period of notice will be very desirable, if not essential, in the interest of all concerned. My point is rather that, given the need for notice and the present growing opposition to the scheme, we should be only prudent if we set to work to prepare a plan of action against the time when the scheme has to be brought to an end.I should therefore like the instructions of the Cabinet as to whether they desire a full confidential and independent enquiry into the future of the scheme.W. forms BY-GORE.Colonial Office, October 10, 1927.Draft Notice.Rubber Exports Restriction Scheme.It is not proposed that any change shall be made on the 1st November next in the regulations which at present govern the export of rubber from Ceylon and Malaya. The Governments of the territories concerned will be asked to overhaul the machinery of the scheme with a view to increasing the efficiency of its working. The Governments are being consulted on the question whether any, and if so what, alterations are required in the regulations now in force. If it is considered that any changes are necessary, full right is reserved to make them as from the 1st February, 1928, as long notice being given as may be practicable in the circumstances.Note of Conclusions of Meeting of Rubber Advisory Committee, held onMonday, October 3, at 3 p.m.1. The Committee agreed to appoint a Statistical Sub-Committee, consisting of Sir G. Grindle, Sir G. Beharrell and Mr. Miller. It was understood that Sir G. Grindle would obtain the assistance of such other Government Departments, including the Board of Trade, as could help in the work of the Sub-Committee, and also that members might be represented by deputies.2. The Committee, generally, recommended that an announcement should be made at an early date that if on the 1st February the price of rubber had not reached Is. Qd. or over restriction shotdd be at the rate of 50 per cent, so long as the price does not reach an average over the quarter of Is. 6d.3. It was decided that a meeting of the Committee should be held about the middle of November to consider Mr. Moseley&apos;s proposal that the percentage of restriction should be determined by the average pi-ice for the preceding month instead of, as at present, the preceding quarter i(this would also take effect from the 1st February), and any other improvements designed to speed up the working of the scheme.4. Question of marking off all exports during each quarter against that quarter&apos;s rights, previously accumulated rights being utilised only after the current quarter&apos;s rights are exhausted. The Committee noted the correspondence which had taken place with the High Commissioner, and recommended that the Colonial Office should watch the position and see that this matter was not lost sight of.5. The Committee regarded it as of the greatest importance that methods^of assessment should be thoroughly overhauled with a view to a more accurate assessment. They further urged that the importance of the prevention of smuggling should be impressed on the Malayan authorities.o
