They are demanding 04    w extravagant increase in wages in the hope of making the industry unremunorative and bringing about nationalisation from another cause. A miners1 strike is therefore likely  in the near future.Thore are demands in many trades for increased wages to meet the cost of living and a period of industrial unrest while these demands are being pressed must be expected.The Rank and Pile Convention was a fiasco.   Half hearted attempts to form District Soviets in different parts of the country are contemplated..The discontent among railwaymen which makes them work to &quot;Rule Book&quot; is causing great congestion at Crewe and other places.It is now definitely known that Mr. Lansbury has arranged with the Soviet Government to supply him with 500 tons of paper free of charge, presumably for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   The paper is to be I  bought and shipped by Strflm from Stockholm.   Mr. Lansbury is expected back in England this week and will address a meeting of welcome at the Albert Hall on Marob 21st.The Socialist Labour Party has been instructed by the Interns-L tional Socialist League of South Africa, to represent them at any f meeting of the Third International.Great efforts are being made in London to bring about a successful celebration on May Day, but it is feared that football I may prove to be a greater attraction.
TR&amp;MS UNION congress in my last Report (No. 45) I made a forecast that the rotes in favour of constitutional action as against direct action for the Nationalisation of the Coal Mines would be 2 to 1.   I understated the case,   The rote of 3 to 1 has &quot;been a severe frlow to the extremists, but it must not be assumed that,.Direct Action for Nationalisation is dead. The extremist minors have merely changed their policy: they will now devote all thoir energies to mailing private owner-ship impossible by successive demands for increased wages until they break the industry and the capitalists have to turn to Nationalisation as a remedy.Everything&quot; points to a strike in the coal mines, if not wholly, then in sections, unless the new demands are granted in full.   The reserve stocks of coal are so small that the position oannot be viewed without anxiety.   In South Wales the men are likely to make a stand for an increase of  2 a week; in Yorkshire, on the other hand, there is no evidence as yet of any strong support for a strike, for the leaders of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association seem to be more concerned with capturing official positions in the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain than with : nationalisation and inoreased wages.The attitude of the Lancashire miners is determined and my correspondent believes that if a strike is called for increased wages they will vote for it to a man.The Warwickshire miners voted for Direct Action by a large majority.An indication of the feeling in Derbyshire is found in the fact that at the monthly meeting of the South Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association the Sxecutive was severely criticised for giving its delegates to the Conference on March 10th a mandate to vote against Direct Action.THE/
THE PROPOSED COHICTIST PARTY &apos;   &quot; &quot;VA.deadlock has been readied between,the South Wales Socialist Society, the Workers1 Socialist Federation, the^ Socialist labour Party and the British Socialist Party. The Socialist Labour Party will concede nothing and as tho Workers1 Socialist Federation is still against Parliamentaij representation the British Socialist Party has decided to form the Communist Party quite independently of the other sections.   For this purpose Arthur McManus, F. Bell and W. Paul have been summoned, to London and it is intended to issue, a manifesto almost immediately and to call a Conference at Whitsuntide,   The matter is being hurried on because the British Socialist Party are afraid that Sylvia Pankhurst might launch a Communist Party of her own, and as the Rank and File Conference has set up social Soviets to bo the basis of revolutionary organisations they do not wish to be left behind.TO LEAVE-TAKING OF THE PggCg OF wales the extraordinary popularity of the Prince among all classes was shown on Tuesday, when a crowd of several hundred people broke through the barrier in their eagerness to take part in a personal farewell.   But for the Police end some Australian soldiers who were privileged spectators the Royal party might have been overwhelmed by a cheering crowd.   His Royal Highness&apos;s popularity will be as great an influence for stability in Australia as it is in England.1 ....m0OST CT LmMG . *iIn my last report it was indicated that there would be extensive demands for higher wages to meet the increasing&apos;cost/
IM*     3    ftirtcost of living.   The workers who are formulating demands include miners, locomotive men, railway supervisors, omnibus, tram and road transport workers, Welsh steel workers, tinplate, canal, dock, Post Office and cotton workers, shop assistants and butchers.   The total number of men involved is over two millions and the minimum demand appears to be for an increase of 10/- a week.   The increases would amount to  1,000,000 a week added to the national wages sheet and of course all this increase must be unloaded on to the consumer with a consequent rise in the cost of living.The reduction of the bread subsidy, which has given satisfaction to taxpayers, is causing much uneasiness amongst the working classes and, to quote one writer, &quot;may Just prove the last straw that breaks the camel1s back.&quot;The influence of congestion at the docks on the cost of food has been often referred to in these reports.   A remedy proposed in Report Ho. 43 was that suggested by Lord JDevonport in his evidence before the Dock Commission, namely, to out losses and throw surplus meat into the open market.THE HOUSING QUESTION: Well informed persons believe that the housing difficulties have as much to do with discontent as high prices.   They certainly have an influence on unemployment, for though there may be openings for employment in a particular district men cannot be transferred from other places because there are no houses available for them.   It has been suggested that the Association to which most of the house agents belong might be induced to organise a sort of exchange register in order that a man, say, at Lover seeking employment at Wolverhampton might obtain from a central/
\central office in Dover the information he needs.As a result of particular enquiries in the Liverpool,Bolton, Manchester and Si*lford districts, however, one of mycorrespondents is able to throw light on the lack of progress made,   fie writes:&quot;Owing to the ever increasing cost of labour and materials many builders are working on industrial work on the following conditions&quot;Instead of giving an estimate for the work to be done, they find the labour and the materials; the cost is paid by the firm for whom the work is being done and the builder gets a percentage as profit.   Therefore, a builder who undertakes work on these terms can offer almost any inducement in the way of wages so long as he gets the work done, and he himself is certain of his profit.   This is no doubt responsible for some brick-layers shunning house building.&quot;A Foreman bricklayer on the Stock Exchange building at Manchester told me he knows lots of brioksettere who would not work on house building under any circumstances and many of them have left their trade altogether and are working at the docks and other jobs where more wages can be earned.&quot;One building contractor said very little progress would be made with house building till other kinds of building are stopped.&quot;Most bricklayers prefer working on Industrial work such as factories rather than on -house building for various reasons.   House building is not so straightforward . as most other classes of work and it is considered monotonous.   On industrial work higher wages and better conditions of service are often obtainable.&quot;For example, on March 10th three bricklayers left one of the biggest contractors in Bolton and went to work at Littleborough where they are to get in addition to their pay  1 a week bonus, a pint of cocoa every . ,    morning and a pint of bovril in the afternoon.&quot;In. this area there are no Trade Union Regulations which stipulate the number of bricks to be laid in a day on any class of work.Everybody admits, however, that as a general rule the men are not laying anything like the number of bricks ^ that could be laid and on certain jobs it has been known that a secret understanding not to over exert themselves has been reached among the men.Various/
&quot;Various estimates are given as to the number of bricks that-could bo laid in an 8 hour day.   Everything depends en the nature of the work; but on straight-forward work the number for an 8 hour day is between 500 and 600 bricks.&quot;WORKING TO RUL33 BOOK&quot;In my Report No.&apos;38 I drew attention to the probability that the railwaymen would adopt oa&apos;canny methods of working to rule book.Owing to the delay in carrying out the recent agreement, the railwayraenhave caused serious congestion during the week at Sheffield and Orewe, -My correspondent reports that in the first named town,, the men have resumed ordinary work in- consequence of a circular letter from Mr. Cramp, Industrial Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, in which he&quot;writes that the,,delay is inevitable.   At Crewe, however, alarge number of men have refused to accept Mr. Cramp&apos;sexplanation and will continue to work to rule book until their arrears under the January award are paid.   Mycorrespondent sends the following   illustration of their&apos; methods-:   - v-. -&quot;Engines that should bring trains from Wolv^rhampton to Crewe and return again the same day, - find an.arrival at Crewe that they have been on too long &apos;rj&apos;o work baolc; consequently they bring their v engine &amp; on to the shed and. go baok as passengers, V/olverhampton,&apos; therefore,&apos;&apos;has to send two enginemen &quot;aiKUone -guard.to Crewo as passengers to work the engine back again,&quot;&quot;Congestion at&apos;Orewe is enormous.   Traffic is refused f::ora other, stations as they cannot get any more goods traffic into the depot and it is the worst &apos;&apos;-&apos;&apos;&quot;-&apos; : &apos;-fblock1 that, Crewe has ever experienced,&quot;The South Wales railwaymen seem as extreme as are theminers in that area;-the,, latest; demand, formulated atSwansea, is for a minimum wage of  6 per week.TH3 COTTON INDUSTRYThere are indications of approaching trouble in thecotton/
cotton industry.   The minds of the o?: natives have nodoubt been inflamed by the abnormal transactions inootton shares and they think that any demands they may 4iput forward will be granted.   They are bound under theexisting agreement to take no action until after April30th and it seems likely that there will be a movementof individual unions rather than of the industry acting as a whole.   An example of the demands that may be expeotis found in a resolution passed by the Burnley WeaversAssociation on March 10th demanding: I(1)    40 hours a week. I(2) 120 per cent advance on the present wegJ (3) A minimum wage of 85 per cent to cover I loss of time and wages, owing to playinl for weft, warps, bobbins, machinery andl engine breakdowns, etc., over which the! cotton operative has no control. 1 (4)    Payment for all holidays. IThere are spasmodic demands for nationalisation andlfor an enquiry as granted to the miners and dockers*    committee MAY DAY CELEBRATIONS IPreparations for May Day are being made energetical in London.   On March 8th  a meeting at Gh&amp;ndos Hall was! attended by representatives of the General Workers&apos; UniJ Croydon Co-operative Men&apos;s Guild, VVomenbCo-operative   I Guild, Amalgamated Society of Engineers, Eleotrioal Tral , Union, Industrial Committee of Labour Party, independoJ I Labour Party, Coamunist League, Bricklayers, Shop Stewaj  I at Croydon Corporation, Furnishing Trade Union, Social! Sunday School, Young Socialist League, Croydon Gas Worl 1 Committee. Amalgamated Society of Engineers No. 2,   ^L^ Discharged Sailors and Soldiers1 Federation, Herald Urn jj United Vehicle Workers, Scholeyfs Works Committee,    I National Union of Clerks, National Painters, Building! j
ot   V      .. Jhrades-0cmmi-tte-e-, Operative Plumb^oxs^Amalgamated, Society of Cabinetmakers, Carpenters and Joiners No. lf Amalgamate Sooiety of Engineers, District Committee  Motormen, Wheelwrights and Ccechmakers, Amalgamated Society of Cabinetmakers, Carpenters and Joiners No. 2, United Builders, and Croydcn Shop Stewards Council.A procession and a &quot;monster&quot; demonstration in Byde Park have been arranged and a meeting is to be held in the Albert Ball.In Glasgow indoor and outdoor demonstrations have been arranged and the anarchist, Guy Aldred, is to be chief speaker.Extremists in the provinces are trying to whip up enthusiasm but greatly fear that if the workers are to lose their pay they will not take a holiday.   In Coventry it is proposed to hold a demonstration without consulting the employers.   Some 2,000 agricultural labourers are expeoted to demonstrate at Leicester, together with a large contingent of the local National Union of Ex-Service Men. My Leeds correspondent reports that grave fears are entertained in this district that the workers will attend football matches instead of demonstrations, as May Bay happens to fall on a Saturday.   This would doubtless oc^ur elsewhere, if matches could bo arranged.It seems pscbable that from all platforms a 44 hour day will be advocated.Unfortunately, no football match is advertised for the Chelsea  round on May 1st.   If an attractive match oould be arranged it would blow away a great many people from Hyde Park.TEE/
THE RAKE AND FILE convention a good deal of publicity has been given to the Rank and File Convention, held before and after the Trades      f Union Congress.   There is no doubt that its bark is worse than its bite - in fact, one of the delegates stated that they were passing resolutions which they could not carry out.   The extremists&apos; contempt for the ordinary workers will scarcely further their cause and it is to be hoped that the South Wales Miners will bo informed that one of their delegates said, &quot;We have got to put the carrot of wages before the donkey&apos;s nose to get them on.MIt was decided that not enough was known about Soviet! and in order to make their objects clearer a special meetii was held on March 12th to discuss the system and form grouj Gallacher claimed that constant strikes were the best methi of introducing Soviets, because they brought the men to thl verge of starvation.   He added that on the Clyde they had taken a census of the population, had arranged how much food and material each person should have *nd had provided for distribution.The meeting was held and fourteen men were appointed i form Soviets in London (four districts), Middlesex, IWalthamstow, Birmingham, Crayford, Croydon, Doncaster, Exeter and West of England, Manchester,   South East Countii and South Wales,   The delegates are to form committees forj propaganda purposes who will call themselves DistrictiSoviets, conduct their own affairs and draft their own mlThey are to compile lists of local machinery and to keep/*-observation on supplies in shops, stores and mills.These &quot;District Soviets&quot; will probably be the Workers Committees under another name.   There is little new in theprescribed/
prescribed functions, and although they have Lenin&apos;s - blessing they will doubtless be impotent through lack of . funds,KEELING, AMONGST EX-SERVICE MB3BTOn March llth a demonstration of Ex-Service men,-held under the auspices of the Glasgow and West of Scotland United Council of Ex-Service Men&apos;s Association in St. Andrewls Hall, Glasgowj was attended by, about 2000; as there are soi*e 109,000 discharged men in the city, however, the meeting could scarcely bo called successful.   The resolutions embodied the claims&apos;and complaints of the various organisations, but the main object was apparently to unify these bodies.   The speakers, amongst whom were Hannah and Alexander Scott, covered the usual gronM, but Mr. G. S. Hutchison, described as an ex-Colonel, urged the men to organise in such a way as. would enable them to take industrial as well as political action.It is now stated by the men&apos;s leaders at Woolwich that as the Government has agreed to set up a Committee to enquire into discharges at the Arsenal, they are not arranging any demonstrations. :My correspondent again reports that the national Union of Ex-Servioe Men is making &quot;&quot;great strides&quot; in South Wales, the miners are openly supporting the Union, and the Fontypridd and Rhondda branch of the South Wales Miners1 Federation has decided to make a grant of  25.THE RETURN OF MR. GEORGE LANSBURY.Mr. Lansbury1b articles in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; have been remarkable for the entire absence of the judicialinstinct/
instinct displayed by the writer.   Comparison between the wireless messages as received by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and the messages as printed shows that the Acting Editoi has omitted passages and interpolated words. Convincing proof has been received that the Soviet Government has instructed Strflm, their looal agent in Sweden, to purchase and sxipply to Mr. Lansbury 500 tons of paper free of charge and is preparing to send over material to Mr. L&amp;lansbury for publication in England.   As the source of proof cannot be publicly, disclosed, steps are being taken to follow up the transaction in Sweden. It seems to be the first&apos; time in the history of Journalis that a daily newspaper in England has been subsidised by a foreign Government.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is arranging a &quot;Great Public- Welcome Home&quot; in the Albert Hall on March 21st.   Mr., Lansbury will recount his experiences in Russia from the platform.RICHARD LEERichard Lee, a Unitarian Minister and now leader of. the Free Religious Movement at Dundee, is a socialist pamphleteer and writer.   He is author of a pamphlet entitled &quot;Lenin versus Lloyd George, Bolshevik Materials and British Idealism.&quot;   John Maclean1 s praise of this production is quite sufficient to damn it.   Lee has also written a pamphlet &quot;Britain&amp;gullt in the Great War&quot; published in Holland.   In the ourrent issue of the &quot;Worke he has written an article entitled &quot;Propaganda for the which attacks the   Capitalist military machine which it describes as the real foe of the Worker.   Be says:-
&quot;I want to urge two methods of influencing the minds of Churchill&apos;s army.   Firstly, in every crowd one has a few soldiers or prospective soldiers. Speakers should never let an opportunity pass of planting the seeds of rebellion.   They should be told it is a dastardly thing to play the game of the masters and help to bind, the chains of the workers all the closer.   They should be advised to choose loyalty to their comrades rather than servile obedience to an unscrupulous plutocracy. This advice is not constitutional, and it is not given by unconstitutional leaders.   But it should be given at every Labour and Socialist meeting. For we fight an enemy who would tear up every scrap of the Constitution in order to uphold the Capitalist system.&quot;The other method is by means of literature and propaganda in the army.   There are comrades who can do this effectually and persistently.   It noeds doing and doing now.&quot;The writer then refers to the Royal Air Force, whichdoes not contain many rebels, as an admirable weapon ofthe Capitalists that can be used against strikers and against the lower races and the lower classes as inSomaliland and in India.   X few aeroplanes will alwaysquell a British mob and that is why so much money isbeing spent on the Air Force.&quot;The time may come when we shall have to stop building aeroplanes.   The Air Force is a bigger military menace, and a menace to Labour, than any army, and even than the boasted tanks, racing 20 miles an hour.   I want the workers to realise the actual foes they have to face, and find ways and means to frustrate their wicked plans.&quot;This article has been submitted to the authorities at the Scottish Office for their opinion as to any necessary action.JOHN Mo LEANThe British Communists have at last become convinced that John MoLean is insane.   For some time he has been under the delusion that his food is poisoned, and his Wyife, who had to suffer a great deal from his delusions, has nNow left him.   A few days ago MoLean announced on a publicplatform/
platform that all the leading Communists in the country, mentioning them by name and including that of Theodore Rothstein, were Police spies.   He refused to be silenced and a deputation came from Glasgov; to consult the Party in London, with the result that they were sent back to try -every means for keeping McLean from making speeches in public.   It will take thorn all their time, ,for McLean will regard this as a fresh conspiracy and will take every opportunity of denouncing them until he is put under restraint.       ,SINN FBIN g GKBAT BRIMBThe friction caused by Sean McLoughlin and his supporters is still rife amongst the Irish element in Glasgow.A meeting of three Delegates from the County boards of Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Dumbartonshire and Renfrewshireof the.. Irish Volunteers was &quot;held, in Glasgow on March 13th,to elect permanent officers to control the VolunteerMovement in Scotland.   The following nominations are reported to have been approved:President Councillor 3. McLoughlinof Clydebank,Vice      w H. T. Jennings, Motherwell.Joint (H. Warren Hutchison, GlasgowTreasurers (James J. Hargan,&apos; Greenock.Joint (M. Sweeney, MotherwellSecretaries (0. Donnelly, CoatbridgeOn discussion it was agreed that where a DivisionalExecutive of the Irish Volunteers is in existence its  .secretary should immediately summon a representativemeeting to which each Volunteer Club should be Invited tosend two delegates.   The first business of such a meetingis/
Is to elect a member to the governing body.   In distriots where no Divisional Executive operates, but where by the 5th April next a minimum of five Affiliated Clubs exists, &apos;   &apos; a conference should at once be oalled to form an organisation such as the Divisional Executive and so fall in line with the arrangements arrived at,Sinn Feiners have been carrying on their propaganda in London on a fairly large scale throughout the week.  At most meetings appeals are made for money to finance the movement and assist the families of those men v/ho have recently been imprisoned.   The balance in hand after paying expenses of the Albert Hall demonstration is reported to bo between  160 and  200.  - &apos;s &apos;\ Iff;?1      - SfOn March 12th there was some discussion at a Sinn Fein meeting in Chandos Hall as to whether the sum of  10 should be sent to Ireland or kept in England&apos;&quot;to assist young men who wanted to get out of the country&apos;&apos;.   It was eventually decided to send the money to Ireland &quot;as funds are badly needed there.&quot; It transpired at the same meeting that the Irish Loan is not being well supported.Mr. William 3ears, Sinn Fein M.P. for South Mayo, who has recently been endeavouring to collect funds in the Birmingham district, addressed a meeting of some 2,000 people at Newcastle on March 14th.   The audience was enthusiastic and a resolution was passed demanding the complete independence of Ireland and the release of all Irish political prisoners.It is reported, but not confirmed, that a gang of men are due to arrive in London about April 1st to organise a rising &apos; amongst the Irish element.   Incendiarism is mentioned as a possible weapon.   This report may be connected, with the rumours of an outbreak in Ireland on April 5th.
IRELANDDuring the past week three of the Provinces continued in a most lawless and unsatisfactory state, and there,is no ( ^improvement to observe.   Intimidation is prevalent every-where, and the task of the police in endeavouring to obtain evidence is well nigh hopeless.So far, over seventy outrages, many of them of a very serious nature, have been reported for the week, but this cannot yet be considered an exhaustive list.   Only one of these outrages comes from Ulster, where, in the Bailieboro&apos; District of County Cavan, threatening notices were put up warning young men against joining the Royal Irish Constabulary There have been several instances during the past few days in other provinces of more drastic measures than this to deter candidates from joining the force.Of the outrages referred to, fifty-four are direotly attributable to Sinn Fein and the Irish Volunteers, and arose out of what can only be termed the state of guerilla warfare now existing between these suppressed associations and the police.Raids and intimidation of.such as venture to disagree with its aims, form the main Sinn Fein activity at present. Intelligence of a valuable nature is being obtained from informers in the Irish Republican Army and it is hoped that in spite of any measures token by the leaders to prevent it, this source of information will increase as the organisation of the Irish Republican Army becomes more and more upset by the continuous arrest of its leaders and prominent members.When considering this disorganisation in Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Armyt it must not be forgotten that some of the cleverest men, especially those at Sinn FeinHeadquarters/
Headquarters In Dublin, are still at large.   If the mentality of these men is considered it is clear that should they once realiso that Sinn Fein with its armed organisations and societies is gradually bein? broken up, they will stop at nothing to retrieve the situation, and, in doing: this, one may oxpeot to see risings or outbreaks In some form or other. Svidonoe is accumulating that negotiations have been going on for some time to smuggle arras into the country from America, Germany and, possibly, other countries.Secret collections for the Irish Republican Loan, the date for closing which has been extended to 1st May, are, believed to be still taking place,   Efforts are now also to. it . &apos;   .......      , -      .. .......      ,i ......be directed apparently to endeavouring to seize offioial correspondence, end mail cars have been stopped and the bags rifled for official letters in several places.   Sinn Fein continues its efforts at propaganda at home by means of &quot;Old Ireland&quot;, its principal weekly paper now.   The current issue is bad, and is again to be seized wherever found.   In a leading article the paper declares &quot;The Irish in America failed to prevent America ^oing to war with Germany to save England from defeat; they will never induce America to go to war with England.   Let us remember that, if an Irish Republic is to be established by us here, and whatever situation arises hero will hate to be dealt with by us here.   If we remain firm England must, sooner or later, evaouate.   She must come to terms, our terms.   Y/e have only to hold out,&quot;The above summarises the Sinn Fein attitude fairly accurately perhaps.   The Homo Rule Bill is not considered at all by the Sinn Fein party.   The National Executive of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress met in Dublin during th* week, and apropos of the Home Rule Bill passed a unanimous/
unanimous resolution that the only clause to be added to the Bill to make it satisfactory would be one &quot;that this    ^ Act shall not apply to Ireland.&quot; ftNext Sunday a protest against the Irish Education Bill now before Parliament ie to be signed in all Roman Catholic Churches .^Matters remain fairly quiet in Labour circles, and though the tendency to endeavour to force up wages to meet [bs the Btill rising cost of living is responsible for continual small strikes, and threats of strikes, in different trades and occupations, the situation at present is not such as to cause grave anxiety.   Shortage of coal and the price of all necessaries is, however, causing grumbling and unrest in the towns.   No inflammatory Labour speeches have been recently reported, nor has any literature of a similar natxire come un the notice of the police, though it no doubt circulates surreptitiously amongst Socialists.The tone of the &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; is as usual very 1 bad, and this week&apos;s issue contains a bitter attack on Sir John Taylor, Assistant Under Secretary.   This paper is also again to bo seized wherever found.   The tendency of Sinn Fe particularly as to the system of agrarian agitation with whi it is seeking to gain popularity in some counties, is BolsheThere is still reason for believing that some sort of a rising is intended during the first week in April.* It is reported that numbers of young Sinn Feiners are taking the Sacrament, a phenomenon vhich was noticed just before the Rebellion of 1916.
