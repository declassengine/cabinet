^ Military Secret. 1331From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,nih March 1920.(Received 19th.) 3601.   17th March.   Malleson wires 1.2th March : -&apos; 1. Young Russian agent has arrived from Bokhara. He confirms much we already know from Bolshevik information. Bolsheviks are most suspicious regarding Afghanistan-Bokhara relations, and discovery of Afghan intrigues in. Ferghana, supplemented by further information on same subject gleaned from my propaganda has made them very distrustful of Kabul. They fear subterranean movements, organised and produced by us, are at work, and that something nasty may eventuate. General idea is that they are dwelling on the edge of a volcano. They are furious with Bravin who is regarded as traitor in Afghan payment, and if they can get him out of Afghanistan will probably shoot him.&quot;2. The first and (corrupt group) armies were destined for Turkestan, but, owing to railway difficulties, only part of former and none of latter have arrived.&quot; 3. Papers are full of inspired articles about English design (? missing groups) and English atrocities in India and elsewhere. Bolsheviks in terror of possible English action and influence.&quot; 4. Whole domestic policy of Bolsheviks has changed since arrival of Eliava and his colleagues. *These do utmost to placate people and repair damage of late regime.&quot; 5. informant considers that some arrangement of defensive character has been arrived at between Bokhara and Afghanistan, whereby if Bolsheviks attack Bokhara, then Afghanistan will come to assistance of Bokhara.&quot; 6. Since Amir of Bokhara agreed to rouble notes in Bokhara, latter has been flooded with paper, partly by Bolsheviks and even, more by Afghanistan, who are unloading vast quantities, so much so that local merchants are seriously alarmed, and criticise Amir for concession whilst cursing Bolsheviks for pressing for it.&quot;7. No truth in story of strife between Kabul and Bokhara.&quot;8. No new wireless stations erected. One was much desired for Kagan, but no plant was available.&quot; 9. Food situation grows worse, and scarcity, combined with floods of paper currency, has forced prices up 1,000 per cent, in two months.&quot;
