March 20th, 1920.Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Munitions to inform you that the question of publishing the official History of theMinistry of Munitions has been raised in connection with thecompletion of the records.   A considerable part of the History hasbeen already completed, or is in course of completion;   but thereare still parts which have not yet been compiled and the.Editors are pressing to be informed of the intention of the Government as tothe eventual publication of the History, whether in whole or part.[losuro Attached is a copy of a Memorandum by the Editor in charge of the Iilosuro Historical work, together with a letter addressed to him by one of II.the gentlemen who have been engaged on the :dditcrial work.     The latter may be taken as indicating the general feeling of the contributors on the matter,  -On the general principle of publication the Minister is of opinion that it must be determined according to the public interest, and bjr in no way embarrassing to the responsible Department.   This consideration would apply to many of the records of the Ministry of Munitions.     But there is one particular part of the History which concerns matters of wide interest and which, if any portion of -the History is published, might be singled out as an exception, and that is the record of the activities of the Ministry in regard to Industrial Labour.     The sections of the History which deal with Labour questions already completed or approaching completion are the foilowing(l) The Treasury Agreement.
(2) Munitions of War Act, 191?.(3) Labour Supply, July - Lecomber, 191?-(4) Labour Regulations and the Munitions of War(Amendment) Act, 1915* (?) Limitation of Recruiting. (6) The Progress of Dilution. (7) Control of Women&apos;s Wages, (o) Control of Men&apos;8 Wages. (9) Welfare Policy and Administration.Further sections on Labour Policy and Administration, 1917 - 19L8,will in due course be issued, dealing in particular with the problemsof man-power and dilution during the last two years of the war.These sections deal with a branch of War Administration whiah must be of great interest to a large number of students in various fields of thought and should find a ready sale.The approval of the Treasury has already been given to the printing of the history for official use and the prime oost will have been incurred in any 6ase.     It would thus be necessary only to consider the additional cost of revising and preparing the sections for sale to the public.   It is proposed that this should be carried cut on a oommeroial basis and the volumes Issued as Stationery Office publications.   The additional expense, therefore, of issuing these volumes to the Publio should be more than compensated for by the receipts from their sale.I am, accordingly, to request that the general position ma^ be set forth to the Cabinet with a view to permitting the publica-tion of the Labour sections of the History, or a selection of them, without waiting for the result of the issue of the Naval History of the War, as hitherto decided.I am to add that copies of all the historioal sections which have been issued officially up to the present time have been sent to your&quot;office, and copies of others which are in the proof stage could be also sent if desired.I amSir,Your&apos;obedient Servant,(Signed)   W. GRAHAM GREENE.The Secretary to the Cabinet., 2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.
ENCLOSURE I,Memorandum by Editor 1n charge of the Historical Work, OfficialHistory of M.111Sstry of Munit ions.1. Tho question of general publication of a portion or thewhole of the Official History of the Ministry of Munitions had not ye been finally determined.   The editors are anxious that this question should now be raised and favourably considered, since uncertainty as to the ultimate disposal of the work is reacting unfavourably upon arrangements for completion.     It is felt that the public should be given an opportunity of using the experience there recorded in order to understand the economic and industrial problems of the present day. 2. Some portions of th^ record are of predominantly domesticdepartmental interest, while the military or scientific character of other portions must limit their circulation.   Another, and a con-siderable portion, however, deals with matters which are of wide general interest, in regard to which the spread of information is definitely desirable.3* Whatever value the History of the Ministry as a munitionssupply organisation maj have for the purpose of guiding the mobilisa-tipi of industry at a time of national crisis, will diminish with the advance of time and the development of new economic conditions.   On the other hand a knowledge of the Ministry1s work is essential for a just appreciation of the industrial and economic problems of the present day and will beoome increasingly important.     The activities of the Ministry profoundly affected every department of the industrial&apos; life of this country, and their success or failure indicate the lines along which advance may or may not 3?e practicable.   -Further, partial and prejudiced accounts of the Ministry&apos;s policy and work have already begun to appear and will probably grow in number.   These, based as they are on isolated documents or such statements as were made public&apos; during the war, are apt to produce serious misconceptions and ill-founded inferences on social and eoononia subjects concerning which sound decisions and an enlightened public opinion are of national consoquenoe.
2nd Mar oh, 1920.4. It is therefore urged that the faoilities should he.....givenfor the publication in r/^e first plane of the sections of the Historydealing with Labour matters, either as an &quot;official&quot; publication inthe full sense, or alternatively as a piece of historical researchsubmitted to censorship but not involving an official imprimatur.In either case the authorship should be stated.5. -he sections already eompleted which deal with labour questions are:-l] The Treasury Agreement.2 Munitions of War Act, 191!?.3) Labour Supply July - December, 191?*4) Labour Regulations and the Munitions of War(Amendment) Act, 19l6.5) Limitation of Recruicin$.6) Tho Progress of Dilution.7J Control of Women&apos;8 Wages,In addition the following sections are now approaching completion:(8) Control of Men!s Wages.(9) Welfare Policy and Administration.(lOj Housing undertakings bjr the Ministry of Munitions,(ll) Statistical review of man-power during the War.To complete the survey further sections on Labour&apos;policy and Admin-istration 1917 - 19*8 will in due course be issued, dealing inparticular with the problems of man-power and dilution during thelast two years of the war.6. Should the publication of the Labour volumes be approved itwill be.neaessary to consider whether similar treatment should not b-accorded to those other volumes which deal with questions of general interest; (l) The record of Administrative Policy under successive Ministers of Munitions, (2) Financial Policy and Administration, (3) Industrial and Commercial Control including; the creation, equipment and operation of National Factories, matters which are all of wide public interest and no longer of a necessarily confidential character. &apos;(Signed)    (1.

EUClOijUKB II.EXTRACT OP LETTER TO THE EDITOR IN CHARGE Off THE HLrlORIClL 1 QRg OFFICIAL HIbTQRY OF MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS,  FROM ONE OP THE COMEILBKS.Brasenose College.-OXFORD.&apos;   , 29th February, 1920.X        a        JL X Ji X        .X        X        XIt is partly because I do not think it possible to complete the Labour History in a short time that I am anxious to see what has been done made public.     If that should commend itself to competent judges as a fair account of the facts, and as of value for the proper   understanding of the present situa-tion, and as indicating on what lines advance may be practicable or otherwisej then it would be a great encouragement to perse-vere with the remainder, and I cannot doubt that such encouragement (in addition to the experience already obtained in handling the subject) would result in a sequel better .-written, more interesting and mere instructive than anythingthan lt at any rate, have yet written.     If, Qn the other hand, competent judges weie not favourably impressed with v;hat has been done, that would show either that the wrong person had been en A mat 3d with the job or that the time was not yet ripe even fcr what Bacon would call aTprima vinderaiatis1- X X X        X j,l a XI should like to see Volume VI through.     I am very much interested in the subject as you know.; and I hate to leave jobs unfinished.     Also I like to work at original documents, and get down to bed rock.     Much as I am interested in Labour I don&apos;t think I should ever have attempted to write anything on the subject merely from what one can pick up out of the newspapers or such accidental collections of material as come
in the way of the general public.     Also I find a speotal fascination in what is current.     I have not the interest of a true historian in the past as such.     For that reason I always refused to make Ancient History my line here, though I was strongly urged to do so, and at one time considerable inducements were put in my way to that end.     For all these reasons I am anxious to go on with Volume VI.At the same time :Box ruit1;   and one cannot throw prudential considerations entirely to the winds.   As you will fully appreciate, people here attach a good cleal of importance to the question whether a man has published anything.     In regard to what has been done I make no particular claim.     It was a war service, though it was   very different from anything I contemplated when I offered my services in 1915.     And though some people have got credit out of the war, many of the best have not.     But, however that may be, personal considerations paturally arise, when one is surveying the best way of laying out oners time and energy for the next two or three years. In my opinion the History of the Ministry should hot be published, anonymously;   but the names of these who have contributed to it should be acknowledged.This, however, is I think quite secondary in comparisonwith the importance of publication.     I think that the Historyis of importance for the understanding, discussion and solutionof many of the main problems with which we are now confronted.In 50 years1 time I don&apos;t thini? the History will be of any value to anyone except as a source for the History of the Great War.If it is not published in the near future, it will not be used by anybody.     Government Departments are far toe much obsessedby the pressing? problems of the hour to&apos; study it;   and theinformed opinion of the general public will have no opportunityof consulting it.     Therefore, if the History is not to bepublished, it seems to me that it is not worth the labour and time and energy expended on it (tut to mention the moneYj.XI 2       X       I       S .1 X       X I(Signed) A.J*3mz$ti$Qn,
