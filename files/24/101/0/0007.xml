2,        The matt^-my-t^^ ;under the heads of(a) disahied men, and(b) non-disabled men.Disabled Men.5.        Some extension of donation to disabled, men is probably unavoidPble because of the much greater difficulty which they experience in finding employment as compared with non-disabled men, and also because of the unavoidable shortage of facili-ties for providing training.4,        As regards the general form of the extension, it is suggested that -(1)     The rate of donation should be the same as under the special extension expiring on 51st,March, namely 20s, a week, and should be subject as nearly as possible to the conditions which were applied on that occasion.(2)   A fresh extension should be given relating to the period of three months from 1st April to 30th June, and during this period the maximum amount of donation to be drawn under the extension should, be limited to ten weeks. 5,        The date 30th June is suggested as being one at which . the general state of employment is likely to be at its or about its most favourable point, ana therefore this date will afford the best opportunity of refusing a subsequent extension, The date at which it is proposed that the Unemployment Insurance Bill should come into operation is 1st October but this is not of much practical importance in this connection because four weeks&apos; contributions (i,e. four weeks&apos; work) are necessary before benefit becomes payable under the Bill and a great many disabled men are not likely to pay this number of contributions for some time after October 1st,     Such a date as 1st.October, moreover, has the disadvantage of bringing the extension to an
end at an unfavourable period of the year because the general state of employment will then be beginning to undergo the usual seasonal depression of the winter, 6.   A further special point arises with regard to disabled men who have completed a preliminary course of training and should continue for a period as &quot;improvers.&quot;     For various reasons a vacancy for an improver is often not obtainable for some weeks, and at present these men are left without resources (beyond their ordinary pension) during this interval,   It has been suggested that a special allowance should be paid during this interval, but the proposal in paragraph 4 will, during the interval between 51st March and 30th June, give these men donation up to ten weeks $ and this is probably sufficient to meet all the oases that are likely to arise,7*   The long periods for which disabled men tend to remain on donation creates a problem of great difficulty.   The donation scheme was Intended as a provision for men dis-charged from the Army (or from civilian work) who might be expected to be absorbed in employment as industry recovered, Disabled men who have drawn donation continuously for very long periods and who as far as can be seen, will go on drawing donation as long as it is available, are not proper subjects for a scheme of this kind except on a purely temporary basiso   It is worth consideration, therefore, whether the examination of this problem from all points of view, including those of employment, training and pensions, should not be committed to a representative commission, and the establishment of this commission might-suitably be announced at the same time as the temporaryectension of donation for disabled men above suggested.   It may perhaps be objected that such an3 o enquiry/
enquiry would amount/ in...effect to..rty--openirxg* the -general quest.;;.oil of the rates of pension for diabled men. Undoubtedly&quot; this is so to some extent, but the enquiry could probably be limited by reference to the possibilities of obtaining employ-ment so as not to re-open the whole question,   in any event, if the enquiry is to lead to practical results by June 30th, it must be started at once.11 on - Pi s able d&apos; Men.8. There is a strong case for declining to grant any further extension of donation to non-disabled men. All the men concern-ed must either :- -(i) have drawn at least 39 weeks (and possibly as much as 48 weeks) donation since their demobilisation^ or(ii)   have been turned down by   the Local Employment Committee as not deserving of further donation!), or(ill)   have been in employment for a considerable part of the period since their demobilisations9h   It is A.reland that the greatest amount of difficulty will probably arise if no further extension of donation to ncn-disabled men is granted after March 31st.   The proportion of ex-service-- men unemployed in Ireland is considerably higher than elsewhere., and there is unfortunately small prospect of their absorption into ordinary industry at any early date, Even as regards Ireland, however, it is not recommended that an extension of donation should be granted to non-disabled men provided that really effective measures are pat in hand at once to commence work which will provide employment for then a
t10,       Even in Great Britain the refusal of an extension-., of donation to non-disabled ex-service men will probably provoke protests of considerable intensity.   This point is mentioned in order that the Cabinet may have it in mind in coming to their decision, but it is nevertheless recommended that a stand should be made and no further extension granted to non-disabled men, 11,   As from 1st January last the special extension of donation at 20s, a week with no  children&apos;a allowances was applied to one class of civilian workers, viz, merchant seamen, on the ground that their services during the war ought to be held to rank with those of men serving with the Forces,   This extension expires oh 31st March,   Pre* sumably the decision with regard to merchant seamen will follow the same lines as that relating to non-disabled ex-service men,
1.   Out-of-Work Donation is payable at present to ex-service men as follows(l) During   12 months foilow ing personal demobili sation,(a) First period - 26 weeks * at 29s/- a week and ohildren*s allowances.Subject to review and suspension by Local Employment Committees after 1? weeks.&apos;(b) Seoond period -   13 weeks (non-disabled men)20 weeks (disabled men),  -at 20s/- a week and children&apos;s allowances (men with 20$ disablement and no dependants, 24s/*) .If, and so far as, granted by Local Employment Committees.(2) Between 24th November, 1919, and 51st Llarch, 1920 (after exhausting rights under^intld..Special extension -   9 weeks   - at 20s/- a week without ohlldten&apos;s allowances,J/f, and so far ,asf granted by Local Employment Committees. 2,    Accordingly, ex-service men may run out   of donation:-(l) In.period upto 31st March, ,1920 -(a) Because donati on has been &quot;&quot;suspended, or an extension refused,, by the Local Employment Committee;(b) Because they have drawn the full 9 weeks under the special extension,&apos;   (2) After 31st March, 1926 -(a) Because donation has been suspended, or an extension refused, by the Local Employment Committee, within 12 months after their demobilization.(b) Because they have exhausted the maximum of 39 (or 46) weeks&apos; donation allowable during the 12 months after demobilisation whether or not they had drawn any donation under the speoial extension;(o) Because 12 months have expired since their demobilisation, irrespective of the amount of donation drawn.(NOTE:- Men who enlisted after 24th November,: 1920, are not entitled to donation., and those who enlisted between 25th November, l&apos;919, and 24th November, 1920, are entitled to less than the usual amount.   The general question of limiting the   issue of donation policies is under consideration).3.   The number who had drawn the full 9 weeks&apos; donation unier the speoial extension, was at 20th February 18,700 and was increasing at the rate of about 2,000 a week.   The corresponding number at the end of March may therefore be estimated at 31,000.   It is not possible to say how many of these will remain unemployed.4,     On 31st March there will be according to present indications 30,000 drawing donation under the special extension.   All these will stop on that date.
5.     As from 31st March, the gross, numbers Whose donation policies will expire et various dates (owing to the expiration of 12 months since demobilisation) will be approximately as followsOn or before 31st llarch, 1920 2,750,000&quot;        &quot;     20th April, 1920 3,200,000&quot;        &quot;     31st Hay, 1920 3,500,000&quot;        11     30th June, 1920 3,760,000&quot;        11     31st July, 1920 4,000,000&quot;        &quot;     31st August, 1920 4,100,000Some addition should be made to these totals on account of men who have exhausted donation although 12 months have-not elapsed since demobilisation.   On the other hand, a considerable deduction should be made on account of such classes as employers, professional men, those working on their own account, students and teachers, &amp;c, as well as the incidence of deaths.In applying an unemployment percentage, account should be taken of the probable progressive improvement in employment during these months.Having regard to all these factors it may be estimated that the number unemployed who will under present arrangements have exhausted donation during these months will be somewhere about 100,000 each week on the average.6.     Of the estimated number of 100,000 quoted in paragraph 5, about one-quarter (or 25,000) may be estimated to belong to trades insured against unemployment, and therefore entitled, as a rule, to receive unemployment benefit at 11s. a week.7.,    The proportion of disabled men among ex-servicemen unemployed is estimated at 20.to 30 per cent and for obvious reasons this proportion will tend to increase,8.     The number out of the estimated total of 100,000 who would be entitled to donation if an extension were granted after 31st Kerch depends on the conditions applied to the extension, -e..g.t-(a) if the period during which the 9 weeks extension granted last November were extended fco as to expire (say) on June 30th instead of March 31st, but without any increase in weekly number drawing this extension would exceed 40,000;(b) if a fresh extension were given to 30th June and everyone entitled to make a frest start and draw donation up to a maximum of 9 weeks between 31st March and 30th June the weekly number drawing donation might be as high as 60,000,In either case the conditions applied to the grant of the extension (e.g. the requirement in general of proof of employment since the armistice) would rule out a considerable proportion of theunemployed ex-service men, particularly those who/are not disabled.9.    If eh extension were granted to disabled men only the numbers on donation each week under the two suppositions set out in para, 8(a) and 8(b) respectively may be estimated tot&amp;e:*under 8(a)       20,000 &quot;     8(b)        30,000
