The demand which the Poles raise against Russia that she should rerounoe her title to the territories acquired in the &quot;partitions of Poland&quot;, is meant to play on, the vague, Ill-formed sentimental ism which exists on the subject.     In reality Russia did not annex any ethnically Polish territory in the three Partitions.     The territory now marked off as indisputably Polish by the provisional frontier given to Poland at the Paris Con-conferenee was not acquired by Russia until 1807 and 1815.     The only crime therefore which Russia committed in the three Parti-tions was to have allowed Austria to annex Little Russian terri-tory in East-Galicia %ni Sastem Cholm, a crime for which Russia atoned on the (sblioi&amp;n battle-fields in 1914-7 but from which the Poles are still trying to draw advantage.gv The territories which intervene -between the eastern frontier of Poland as fixed, at the Paris Conference and Poland1 s frontier of 1772 are more ths-n three times the size of the whole of ethnic Poland and have a population of thirty millions, of which con-sidsrably less than three millions are Poles,     The total number of Poles in the world is very much smaller than the non-Polish population of the &quot;Eastern Borderlands&quot; now claimed by them.The impenetrable Pripet Marshes extending due east of xifest-, L&amp;tovsk divide the territory into two. distinct parts5 !/white Russia j Lithuania and Lattgalia in the north, the western Ukraine and East- !-?lioia in the south.
Lithuania, XattgKlia^an&amp;^Mt^s^R^ a popu-*latlon of about thirteen millions, of whieh at tho utmost 10 per cent are Poles (according to the Russian official census of 1097 only 6 per cent), about 13 per cent Lithuanians, 14 per cent Jews, 4 per cent Letts and the rest - about-60 per cent - white Russians. The Lithuanians, lotts and unite Russians inhabit distinct terri-tories, the Jews and Poles are scattered throughout the country.Lithuania proper comprises the Government of Kovna, tho north-western and western parts of Vilna and also the greater part of Suvalki, which from 1815 till 1915 formed part of the Congress Kingdom of Polando - i&apos;he territory of the Roman ^-Catholic- -Letts, usually called Lattgalia, comprises three administrative districts of Vitebsk (Lyutsin, Ryeshitsa and Dvinskh - By far the largest of the three divisions, vifhite Russia, consists of the remaining parts of Vitebsk and Vilna, the northern and central parts of Grodna and of the Governments of Minsk end Mogilev.South of the Pripet Marshes the territory is pnrely LittleRussian,     It comprises, besides the southern fringes of Grodna,Volhynia, lodolia, ICiev and East-Gal icia, to which also theeastern^ districts of Oholm should be added.     its these, however.,have been assigned to Poland, because the Little Russian population has sacrificed itself for the ca,use of the Allies in withdraw in?(x)with the Russian armies,    they will in fixture be left out of aceountox) Of the Greek Orthodox Little Russians no less than 89 per centobeyed the orde^of the Russian. Supreme Council to &quot;leave but a desert to the Germans&quot;, of the Roman Catholic Poles no more than 8 per cent showed the same amount&apos; of devotion to the Allied causes The Little Russian emigrants have so f?r heel little chance to return to their homes, the Poles having done ell they could to exclude them,     i&apos;he Polish Commission at the Paris Conference in its report Bo0 6 acted on the principle that &quot;les absents ont toujours tort&quot;, whatever the reason of their absence maybe.
Volhynia, Podolia and ICiov had before the War a population &quot;ofabout 12-1 millions, of which about 500,000, i0e3 4 per, cent were Poles, 13 per cent Jews, the remainder Great Russians and little Russians-;    last -fe 1 i c ia. h a s a population of five mill ion 8, of which ?t tho very utmost 20 per cent are Poles, 12-1 are Jews,the remaining 67 per cent Little Russians,     Thus the southern division of Poland&quot;s &quot;Borderlands&quot; in a population qf about 1-7-J-millions includes only 1% million; i*eo about 8C5 per cent, Polos.The Polish claim to these enormous areas rests exclusively on the Polish ownership of most of the big landed estates, of something like 40,000 square miles of land.     This seems hardly a valid title to dominion in tho days of democracy and of agraria.ii reform,     -But it is just because these are the critical days of agrarian reform that the Poles so insistently claim the &quot;EasternBorderlands&quot;a    Were the same measure of agrarian reform whichthe Polish Diet to ted for 11$ and pn July 10th 9 1919 9 honestly&amp;;&amp;sappearo    Uhsarirt Russia was unable to unroot it because itcould not sacrifice a conservative nobility to its peasants8 not even a Polish nobility to Ifcissian peasants^     Russian democracy can and must0    That is why In 1833p vfhm Esb:min offered to raise I a Russian peasant revolution in support of the Polish -National iaaiirraction3 the most radical of his Polish friends, Demon fcowicz, I told him that they preferred to be defeated by Russian imperialism.! to &quot;being saved by a Rassis-n peasant revolutionsVqlinl\ *uemeemoy* eontinues to assert the claims of the Polish nobles, not for the nob3.es, but for their self ^constituted \heirs*    The Polish peasant considers the estate &quot;the demesne&quot; of the Polish noble in Poland, to be the preserve of the peasants of the village attached to it;   Htill it will not be difficult to pgrsrAde him that the estate of the Polish noble in Whiteapplied Id. tho BorS.035^.430ill traea of Polish dominion would

East-Galicia and Lithuanian    At the. flrnt meeting of this Association hold at Craeow on Estonia ry Z*jth9 1920, it was explained that KDhe settling of war-:Invslids in the Bordories?ds will attract masses of Polish peasants who now hesitate to buy land there 9 although it is cheaper, for fear of the alien element&quot; (iQe3 of the local Russian peasantry)*     This is a faithful replica of the scheme which in 1918 Marshal von Hindenburg developed for the German Barons in the Baltic Provinces, who were to have received garrisons of German settlers5 preferably of &quot;war heroes&quot;0The social conflict between the interests of the Poles on the one hand and those of the Lithuanians, ,,hite Russians and Little Russians on the other would by itself render close co-operation or federation between the two groups impossible even were they all nations separate and distinct from the Russians,     They could not trust Poland any more than the Letts or Esths could trust Germany to remain impartial in the straggle for ag&amp;arian reform - an alliance between these States and Poland would be an alliance of the rider and his horse, and none of them will agree to it0But as a matter of fact the uhite Russians and Little Russians are branches of the Russian, nation and the overwhelming
h-*5 -mass among them never considered themselves anything else,     They are hound up with Russia not merely Ir- the social interest of the Peasantry, but bv tradition, language, culture and religion.     fox centuries the Poles had attempted to break up Russiars national unity, first by union with the Roman Cr.tb.olic Church in the western parts of Russia under Polish dominion, and then by encouraging national separatisms,,     The union with the Roman Church, imposed by the Poles after a bitter struggle, was swept away by the Russian Government without tho population concerned offering any opposition whatsoever (the only resistance was encountered from the Polonised Uniafs in Western Cholm, nowhere from Little .or mfhite Russians),, The idea of the church union had never struck root in the con-consciousness of the peasantry *. it found its expression in problems beyond the reach of the peasant mind (the authority of the Pope and tho &quot;filioquo&quot; clause) o     In all its visible forms theUniat did not differ from the Greek Orthodox Church -* its churches had the Byzantine copulas and the double Eastern Cross, its priests were not bound to celibacy, the litrygt was in the vernacular and the Communion under two formsoIn East-Galicia the anti-Russian intrigue was ta^en over &amp;M fostered by Austria and ultimately by Berlin,     In the abnormal conditions, so different from those of the Russian Ukraine, a strong separatist movement grew up among the East-Galician Little Russians or Ukrainians, as they began to style themselves,     In complete ignorance of conditions beyond the Russian border, they honestly believed that all the population of South Russia from Eastern Cbolm and Bessarabia to the Don and the Kuban considered themselves distinct in nationality from Russia,,     The experience of the .jar and the Revolution was a rude awakening for them * They now found that the overwhelming majority of their people considered itself essentially Part of the Russian nation,,     The proceedings of the Poles in East-Galicia, the ill-will shown by certain Powers and the impotence of others to prevent Polish
aggression and oppression, completed the conversion of the East-G-alician Ukrainians.     They now recognise that no one hut Russia can save them from the Poles, and that the problem of East-Gal icia which had hitherto loomed so enormously large before their short-sighted eyes is only part of the old struggle between Russia and Poland;   they joined forces even with Denikin, merely because they saw in him    representative of Russia and an en&amp;my of Polish Imperial ism0In .white Russia the small group of White Russian intelligent-sia, or half-intelligentsia, professing a nationality separate from that of Russia could probably be seated on a large-sized sofa. The movement has absolutely no hold on the people, who merely know that they are peasants, Greek Orthodox (at least about seven-eighths of them) and ^Russki&quot;0But even if there was a separate Ukrainian and a separate si/hite Russian nationality, their existence would supply no basis for a claim to &quot;self-determination&quot; within the frontiers of 1772a The country of the Little Russians cannot be encompassed between the eastern bofier of East-Galicia and the Dnieper and thus limited to Russian Podolia, Volhynia and Kiev;    it extends from the San to the Don, i,e, comprises moreover East-Galicia, Eastern Cholm, the Governments cf Kherson, Poltava, Ekaterinoslav, Kharkov and parts of Ghernihov, Kursk, Voronezh and even some of the Cossack districts, and moreover the &quot;Russka Kraina&quot; in north-eastern Hungary, parts of the Bukovina and of Bessarabia.     This would be a State of well over 40 million inhabitants.     But what the Poles want for their newly re-discovered &quot;wards&quot; is &quot;self-determination&quot; under Polish dominion, i.e0 as far as the Polish landed estates   . . extend in southern. Russia, an idea fit to evoke enthusiasm in the Poles bu/trin no one elset - The same applies to white Russia.     The
Polish frontiers of 1778 do not mark the borders of the whiteRussian dialect but of the Polish landed astateSoBut the Poles propose to celebrate the Virth of two new&quot;nations1&apos; by carving up their bodies.   There are to be the &quot;annexed1parts&quot; of iilhite Russia and little Russia (Vilna, Grodna and partsof Minsk, Eastern Oholm, East-Galicia and part of Yolhynia), theprotocted Parts (the rest of Minsk, Mohilev and Vitebsk^ eastern.Volhynia, Podolia and Kiev), and the &quot;unredeemed&quot; parts in the(x)outer darkness, beyond the sacred lines of 1772*     If any one set out to -rite a humorous story he could not invent anything brighter,, Among the Ukrainians in Sast-Oalicia there has been anti-Russian separatism, and there is must a chance of making the difference of religion into a wedge between the few hundred thousand Roman  . Catholic White Russians in the .*est and Russia.     But these two groups are to be excluded from the future &quot;national  States&quot;&apos; , whilst their &quot;nationality&quot; is to be created where it does not exist at present;   and this territory in which the new nationality is to be created is in turn, to be circumscribed according to the oon-venisnce of the Polish big landowners and of the Polish Stateu    It requires indeed some coolness on the part of the Poles, greater if anything than that of Herr von Kuhlmann at Brest-Litovsk, to come forward as champions of these nationalities at a time when they are oppressing the little Russians and .Oiite Russians by every means at their disposal.It is claimed b &apos; the Poles that in. .;hite Russia and Little Russia the &quot;Russians&quot; form but a tiny go?oup9    One. might equally well say that in Bavaria the Germans form a very small group, ifThere are certain differences among the Poles as to how much to annex directly to Poland and how much to leave to the &quot;protected confederates-&quot;-,)     Thus, e0ga, some are in favour of annexing Vilna to Poland, others would leave \% %o a &quot;confederated&quot; Grand-Duchy of Lithuania, iPe, a State consisting of ethnic Lithuania plus -tfhite Russia under Polish --supremaey.
mone sorites as Germans only those /ho use the literary German language:, and excludes all those who speak the Bavarian patois. Under Polish administration these &quot;Russians&quot; are &quot;removed&quot; from all influence in public affairs, in fact they are arrested, in-terned or expelled, This simply means that the entire educated class of the nation is removed so that the rest should he left as a passive mass to the Poles0The proposal of the Poles: to hold a cua si-plebiscite under;their own military occupation has now been vetoed by the Ambassadorial Conference in Paris, and the Polish Government has been informed that the Allied and Associate! Powers would con-sider such a. plebiscite null and void0   But even under Allied supervision a plebiscite could not be held at present to settle the fate of the occupied territories in the east8   In the first plaoe a very large proportion of the population, varying from 25 to 80 per cent, is absent - the Russians who voluntarily obeying the orders of the Russian Military Command, left the country, an act of loyalty and self-sacrifice for tho Allied cause which mus not be rewarded as it has been in the case of Eastern Cholm, Secondly, a plebiscite held at present would be complicated b.) difference of social structure existing between Poland and Russ:, The division would no longer run on purely national lines., where it is a national dispute which the plebiscite would profess to settle0If the plebisoite is to be fair, both sides must be allowed the same freedom of propaganda, but our ideas condemn, propaganda in favour of a Bolshevik system^     The pronouncement of the will of the population as between a capitalist Poland and a Bolshevi&apos; Russia will thus not be free, not even under Allied occupationa But even were both sides allowed freedom of propaganda the vertf of the plebiscite would be invalidated should either Poland be&quot; Bolshevik or Russia capitalist.   The non-Bolshevik Russian,: wit&apos;: perfect fairness point out that large numbers of Russianl
tevy have-&apos; prof ari^d. a, ^.pxt^ Russia,although they would not prefer it to a capitalist Russia, aid that therefore the results of the vote carrot hind Russia after she has ceased to be Bolshevik.    Or the other hand, a Bolshevik Poland could in. the same way claim that Polish peasants in the y disputed districts voted for Bolshevik Russia merely because it appealed more to the lower classes than capitalist Poland.To sum ups   plebiscites to decide the nationality of-te-rri^... toriss can be bald only as between--St-ate.s..Jhaving the same social basisr and the idea of any plebiscites at the present.,moment in the territories disputed between Russia and Poland is impossible. If a fair frontier is to be drawn, it has to be drawn on the pre-War nationality map.The frontier between Russia and Poland having been drawn according to the prewar nationality map, ioe0 the provisional eastern frontier of Poland as drawn at the Paris Conference having been declared permanent, the territories in the east now under Polish occupation ought to pass under some kind of Inter-national control, if possible, under a Commission of the League of Nations,,     The government might then be carried on on an impartial basis leaving the ultimate settlement of these terri-tories to a future date&quot;&quot;when conditions in. Russia have attained a higher degree of stability.It might be objected to this sftbeme that it would throw a considerable burden on the League of Sations.    This burden wouldB however, be small compared to the clangers which are bound to ariso from a continued Polish-Russian conflict.     Such a neutral zone ur^Ler Allied control would be the best protection for Poland, which could then dispense with its over-grown army and settle down to the already much too long delayed work on int^^ial economic reconstruction.    Lastly, such territory under an international Commission presided over by an Englishman or a
neutral, woulct offer an excellent -basis-for our future policy with regard to Russia both from the economic and the political point of view.     The difficulties implied in such a proposal are obvious, But there is nothing else which could be suggested for the solution of a problem which certainly requires settlement, and speedy settlement in addition.If this idea is taken up it will be essential to insist that all, but absolutely ell, non-Polish territory in the East now in Polish occupation must be handed over to fcho league of Nations&apos;, It would be utterly intolerable were the Poles allowed to retain, e.g, East-Galicia and Vilna and thus use the territories under the league of $ations as a cover for their Imperialist conquest and forcible Polonisati-n of non-Polish territory.     Rather than take the burden of constituting ourselves guarantors of Polish violence anywhere, it would be better to abstain from all action and let the Poles and the Russians freely fight the matter out be-tween themselves,But even should this suggestion be found impracticable, the Polish argument of their hewing to be left in territory which they &quot;liberated&quot; from the Bolsheviks cannot be accepted as valid,, Prom all evidence in our possession the Polish government in these occupied territories is nothing short of atrocious.    Even did we know nothing about its misdeeds, the incontestable facts illustrating Polish military and administrative action brought to the attention of His Majesty1 s Government by Sir Reginald Tower and General Macready of how the Polish soldiers and officials behave at home or under the eyes of the High Commissioner of the league of Nations, easily suggest what their rule must be where they are free of -11 control,     Prom Captain riiright&quot;s report; which, though in the first place concerned with the condition of the Jews in Poland, supplies an excellent survey of the situation in general, one can infer that the Bolshevik government in ..hite
Russia, however ludicrous, was milder and less cruel than the Polish.     He writes as follows:   ^The Bolshevik chariot was drawn neither by terror nor by plunder;   there were no executions ex-cept military executions of deserters by the Chinese executioners. The Bolshevik administration was a parody of the Tsarist adminis-t rat ion, which itself was little better than, a parody.&quot;But this is the description which he gives of the Polish gendarmerie:   &quot;I say $rery deliberately, and relying on Polish, not Jewish,evidence   that the conduct of the gendarmerie was such tint in many parts of Poland they exercised a kind of brigandage * *.. * The whole population, suffered from the gendar-merie, and they treated the Jews as prey who must alleys pay up, on every possible pretext, and who were lucky to escape without a broken bead.&quot;A sample of what these same people are capable of in white Russia is supplied by Captain Wright*s account of the Polish ox-ecutions at Pinsk:   &quot;The gendarmerie who made the arrests and reported that thoy had found a Jewish Bolshevik meeting, were chiefly responsible;   their motive was no douftt to avoid answering for the money they had obtained in the search.     Their subsequent conduct was even worse0     The Jewish ladies arrested but exempted from the execution were kept in prison without trial or inquiry,. They were stripped naked and flogged.    After the flogging they were ma.de to pass naked down a passage full of Polish soldiers. The Jews arrested but exempted from the execution were next da.y led to the cemete3:y where those executed wore buried and made to dig their own graves;   then at the last moment, they were told they were reprieved;    in. fact, the gendarmerie regularly tor-men ted the survivors.&quot;with a record of which this is merely one small example, the Poles have truly no right to demand to be left in the country
-12-. -&quot;for the sake of civilisation&quot;,,    They are the best hated men in the country and &quot;hated not merely by their specially shosen victims, the Jews, but by White Russians, little Russians and Lithuaniansalike,March 20th, 1920.
