CABINET.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.ENTIAL ---*--Further Note respecting the disposal of profits from thoEgyptian Cotton Control Soheme.I am afraid that tho last paragraph but two&apos; in Lord Curaon1 s memorandum of March 17th (C.P.894) may oause some misunderstanding.-Tho Clause 8, in the Board of Tradefs letter of the 16th March. to tho Treasury, referred to a matter that had been raised with the Treasury when Sir, Hubert Llewellyn Smith on tho 3rd March, cabled that the Commission would prefer to announce that some proportion of the profit would bo devoted to tho improvement of cotton cultivation in Egypt..    As a matter of fact, however, it was decided not to put forward the proposal mentioned in clause 8 and it was never communicated to Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith.The actual course of the negotiations, as conducted at this end, was as follows, so far as finance is concerned.^On February 24th, 1918 Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith cabled the purchase proposal.     It was proposed on the financial side that the British Government should provide funds \xg to a limit of  10,000,000 while another  10,000,000 should be provided by banking and other houses who had hitherto financed the crop.   It was provisionally suggested that 5% on the advances of the banks should be guaranteed by the Treasury and that banks should receive another 1% if earned.    Subsequently a revised proposal was received suggesting a guarantee of 5i$ without the further claim to 1% out of any profits, but with Treasury guarantees of tho whole  20,000,000 and of interest on the funds found in Egypt.   It was also proposed that the balance of profits should be allocated for the improvement and development of cotton cultivation In Egypt.The War Cabinet on March 1st approved the;scheme subject to the assent of the Treasury to tho financial provisions.On March 2nd tho Board inquired of Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith if there was any objection to making no announcement about the utilisation of tho profits, or at any rate of making only a vague announcement.On March the 2nd, the Treasury, adverting to a conversation between the President of the Board of Trade, Mr, Baldwin and Sir Robert Chalmers, wrote to the.Board: as follows:-&quot;the Treasury will not agree to the principle that if any profits&apos; accrue from the scheme, these- should all go to Egypt.    This country is &quot;to bear1 half the loss there may be from the scheme, and it is not equitable that if the scheme is successful thoy should not share any of the       . ; profits.&quot;At the same time they refused to guarantee interest on the money paid up by the banks..Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith cabled on March 3rd that the Commission would prefer to announce that some portion of the profit&quot; would be devoted to the improvement of cotton cultivation in Egypt to prevent suspicions with regard to the Government action.
The Board of ft?ado conferred with the Treasury who would only agree to guarantee  10,000,000 but, offered to give 10$ of any profit on this sum for the advancement of cotton growing in Egypt.    This offer was, however., stated to be conditional on the Egyptian Oovornmoi.it acting likewise (Treasury letter to the Board of Trade dated March 23rd).     It was decided not to communicate the offer to Egypt, and the following cable was sent to Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith on March 6th:-&quot;We have not succeeds in obtaining Treasury assent to guarantee  20,000,000.    They suggest that Egyptian Government should guarantoe ton million, but &quot;if preferred Treasury willing to guarantee full amount providing Egyptian Government will enter into undertaking with British Government whereby it Indemnifies Treasury against any loss on ton million,    Treasury would under this undertaking waive any claim to profit on ten million guaranteed by Egyptian Government.    Please try to secure acceptance by authorities to this proposal.&quot;On the 10th March Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith cabled&quot;by representing cotton scheme as part of general schomo for conserving Imperial resources from which Egypt lias much to gain in other ways, e,g. coal snd shipping, we have (? persuaded) them to jj^tr; Six guarantee as suggested.    Effect of arrangementIs that should there also be eventual loss it would bo shared equally between the two Governments (?whilst) any eventual surplus will be disposed of by agreement between them&apos;&apos;.The relevant passages in Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith!s memorandum and in the Board of Trade letter to tho Treasury and the treasury s reply are quoted in Lord CurzonTs memorandum.There is no doubt at nil that the matter aa settled in Egypt l,eft the disposal Of the profits to agreement between the two Governments \ and no implication wa3 created that the one or the other Government, or any particular purpose, would have any prior claim, though naturally It would be generally expected that some part of the profIts would be used for the promotion of Cotton Cultivation in Egypt,A.C.
