TMb Document is the Property of His.Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 11)20.I THINK that I ought to circulate to my colleagues the following frank but exceedingly important letter which I have just received from our High Commissioner at Constantinople, Admiral de Bobeck, concerning the terms of the proposed Peace Treaty with Turkey.    There is a paper issued by the General Staff at the War i        Office on the same subject, whicrTl have asked them to circulate also, p C. of K./- Foreign Office, S.W. 1,iU &apos;     March 26, 1920.British High Commission, Constantinople, &apos; My dear Lord Curzon, March 9, 1920.The Foreign Office telegram of the 6th March containing the basis of the peace with Turkey decided upon by the Supreme Council has, I confess, come somewhat as a surprise. With two of the proposed terms, namely, the internationalisation of the Straits and the imposition of a close financial control on Turkey, I am in entire agree-ment. But the proposed cession to Greece of all Thrace up to the Chatalja lines and of Smyrna (which is hardly mitiguted by the retention of a nominal and probably valueless Turkish suzerainty) fills me with grave misgivings.I have always maintained that the class which is responsible for having brought Turkey into the war, and for the hideous massacres which took place during&apos; the war, should receive drastic punishment. It is eminently right and proper that Turkey, should forfeit control of the Straits, should lose all non-Ottoman provinces, should have her military element reduced to impotence, and should in general be disrated from the position of a Great Power. But I feel equally strongly that the terms to be imposed on Turkey should (a.) Not be incompatible with the principles for which we are supposed to have gone to war;(b.) Should pave the way for a lasting peace in the Near East; (c! Should be feasible of application without further bloodshed and sacrifices on the part of the Allies.These views are shared by my advisers here, men for the most part with life-long experience of Near Eastern affairs.If we apply these three tests to the proposed cession of Smyrna and Thrace to Greece, what do we find ? As regards (a) it means that we are placing territories overwhelmingly Turkish in population under the rule of the Turks&apos; secular enemies, under whose rule previous experience in Thessaly, Crete and Macedonia has shown that it is almost impossible for Mussulmans to exist- a flagrant violation of the principle of self-determination, to which I was under the impression that the Supreme Council had given its adherence, As regards (b), it is unthinkable, as the Foreign Office has consistently been informed by us here, that the Mussulmans in those areas will peacefully accept Greek annexation, especially after the sample of Greek methods which they have had since the Greek occupation of Smyrna. This is made clear enough by the report of the Inter-Allied Commission on the Smyrna atrocities, but clearer still by the very existence of the nationalist movement in Asia Minor. If the provisional Greek occupation of Smyrna has been, as it undoubtedly has, the canker in the Near Eastern situation since last May, how much more so will definite annexation be the canker for years to come, the constant irritant which will perpetuate bloodshed in Asia Minor probably for generations ? The position of Thrace is analogous, but there is this further consideration, that the notification of its annexation to Greece, or at least the first approach of a Greek force, will almost. certainly be the signal for a stampede of the non-combatant Mussulman population.[2740]
Those of us who have now been grappling with the problem of housing a few thousand refugees from Southern Russia cannot but be appalled at the prospect of being faced in the near future with the problem of accommodating and feeding tens ol thousands of panic-stricken &quot;muhadjirs,&quot; especially when we consider that one of the first results of nationalist opposition to our terms will be to cut us off from one of our principal and nearest sources of supply.As regards (c), it appears from the Foreign Office telegram that the Supreme Council realise that the terms they propose must needs be imposed by force. They are quite right. The terms are such that no Turk, Committee of Union and Progress or pro-Entente can very well accept. The Supreme Council, thus, are prepared for a resumption of general warfare ; they are prepared to do violence to their own declared and cherished principles ; they are prepared to perpetuate bloodshed indefinitely in the Near East; and for what ? To maintain M. Veniselos in power in Greece for what cannot in the nature of things be more than a few years at the outside. 1 cannot help wondering if the game is worth the candle. I should wonder, even if M. Veniselos were immortal ; he is not immortal, but ephemeral, and he is not only ephemeral, but, as regards Greece, a phenomenon. By that I mean that he has no successors of his own calibre. In other words, he is not Greece. He is not, strictly speaking, even Greek. M. VeniseWs deserts vis-a-vis the Entente are great; but is it wise to run the almost certain risk of plunging Asia in blood in order to reward Greece according to the deserts of M. Veniselos, which are very different from the deserts of Greece ?I confess I am amazed at the apparent light-heartedness with which the Supreme Council seem to contemplate another war, and with the apparent readiness of our Government to provide its quota of men for the purpose. Recently, when it was a question of reoccupying Baku and of defending our Indian marches, and eastern Empire generally, against imminent Bolshevik menace, the project, one of possibly vital importance to the British Empire, had to be &quot; reluctantly abandoned &quot; because the requisite troops could not be found. But when it is a question, not of protecting the Empire, but of gratifying the excessive demands of M. Veniselos, these difficulties apparently vanish. This inconsistency may not be obvious to the British public, but I think it would be to Allied officers and men out here, who will hardly appreciate being called upon to sacrifice themselves in order to join Greeks in killing Turks.The British people have been stirred, very rightly, by the recent massacre of between 10.000 and 15,000 Armenians in Cilicia. But at the same time they seem to be contemplating with equanimity the entering into relations with the Bolsheviks men who have instigated the killing, flaying alive, and otherwise torturing of probably hundreds of thousands of their own kith and kin. Perhaps they do not realise that the proposal to dimember Ottoman provinces of Turkey in the interests of Greece will drive the remamino- Turks into the arms of the Bolsheviks, will set the Near East and Central Asia aflame, and will intensify the menace of Bolshevism to the British Moslem world.If the recent stiffening of the Supreme Council as regards Turkish terms is due to the late events in Cilicia, I would say that it seems unsound policy to base what is presumably intended to be a permanent settlement on an incident, the more so when the fundamental responsibility for the incident is as yet far from established.If, on the other hand, it is due to the thunder of the Canons of Canterbury, to the outcry of Near Eastern cranks, and to the ingenious enthusiasm of Dr. Burrows and his friends, it seems to me even less defensible.It seems difficult to reconcile this undue severity towards the Turks, who are believed to be weak, with the undue leniency to the far more unspeakable Bolsheviks, who appear to be strong.You will, I trust, excuse the length of this letter, but it is written with a strong feeling that, we are not acting quite with fairness and justification. Our good name is at stake, and honesty of dealing is probably the greatest asset we have in the Near East. * &apos;Believe me,Yours sincerely,J. M. de ROBECK.
