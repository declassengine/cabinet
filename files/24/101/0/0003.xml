fONFIDENTIAL.Thi3 Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.OIL SUPPLIES.MEMORANDUM TO THE CABINET t1*8?by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I am much concerned in regard to the question of future petroleum supplies.   I find that&apos;the U &amp; .A. arc consuming an increasingly large proportion of their output and will very shortly be unable to continue their exports.   It Kill be remembered that the U .3 .A. are to-day producing 66 percent of the total world supplyj and they are at present importing large quantities of oil from Mexico to meet their own requirements.When I was in charge of &quot;petroleum affairs I foresaw this position and came to the conclusion that it was absolutely Jssible essential to secure control of all/supplies, and particularly toobtain British control over the Royal Dutch-Shell group.     I&apos;  under-stand that negotiations in regard to this proposal, which were al-most complete, are now held up on account of a change in the policy regarding Mesopotamia.If these negotiations are broken off it is quite possible that the big American oil interests may, in view of the changed position in that country, make an alliance with the Snell group, or the latter may come to some close working arrangement with the French Government.It is quite certain that the Royal Dutch-Shell group would have little inducement to maintain its headquarters in London and this would leave us more than ever under obligations to the United States for supplies.Our policy in the past has been to draft upon as many sources of supply as possible, and if the negotiations with the Royal Dutch-Shell group collapse we shall be largely dependent on Persia and Mesopotamia, the latter area being still unproved and problematic as a source of supply.I view the position with considerable alarm, for it seems to me that we are running a serious risk of coming more and more under the control of the United States for our supplies of both petrol and       fuel oil-The vital importance to the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, and the Mercantile Larine of a regular and sufficient supply of petroleum products cannot be ignored: all our Forces may easily be rendered immobile&apos;if we are dependent upon the United States of America for our supplies.   Further, 1 think it is   not recognised how essential these products are to Agriculture and Commerce.   It is idle to ask for increased production if we cannot endure the supply of the motive powers I cannot exaggerate the extent of the disaster which must ensue if we fail to take advantage of this unique opportunity to s&apos;o,,re the assistance of the great existing sources of supply, and instead deliberately pro-voke their hostility and drive them into alliances with foreign interests.If the Shell agreement is carried through this will make it easy to come to a settlement with the French, who are now, I understand, pressing very strongly for a half-share - in Mesopotamia, on the grounds that the commercial companies to whom a concession was formerly promised are not now to be admitted.I urge most strongly that the arrangements with the Royal Dutch-Shell group and with the French Government, vhioh have already been considered and agreed, should be ratified as soon as possible.Intlld.   W.H.L.18.3.20.
