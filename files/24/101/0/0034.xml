Necessary conditions : impartiality and competence.The essential object of the whole enquiry will be to establish the financial and economic results of communism. This point demands special qualifications on the part of the members of the Commission. It is also advisable that they should be selected amongst persons acquainted with the state of Russia before the Revolution and the rise of Bolshevism, so that they may be in a position to compare the present situation with that which formerly existed.Programme oe the Enquiry.I. The balance sheet of Communism.Nationalized industry. The output of such industries. The relation between production and expenditure. How is this expenditure to be met ? Nationalized trade.

What formalities are required and applied for the establishment of arrest and detention in prison? What actions are considered as counter-revolutionary ?Method of Work of the Commission.This.Commission is about to enter upon enquiries in a country governed by means of terror, where opposition to the Government is punished by death, where the system of espionage has developed to an unprecedented degree. We must also expect that the Soviet Government will conceal the true state of affairs in -Russia. It does not consider itself bound by any moral obligation or any law, and does not hesitate in its choice of methods of repression. In these conditions, it is more than probable that the Commission of Enquiry will see only what the Bolshevist authorities choose to show, and that the evidence collected will be either false or biassed. What is necessary to ensure to the Commission conditions in exercising their functions which may be useful in spite of the position of affairs ?1. It is necessary to assign to this Commission as technical experts Russians hostile to Bolshevism, and known to be so, possessed of extensive connections all over the country. It will be sufficient to associate with the Commission Russians hostile to Bolshevism, for the partisans and protagonists of Bolshevism will receive and guide the Commission in Russia itself. As we are concerned with an enquiry in a country which is in the hands of Bolshevists, the presence of Russians hostile to Bolshevists&apos; rule, and prepared to impeach it is as necessary as was the evidence of Armenians at the time of Turkish atrocities in their country. These anti-Bolshevist Russians will constitute, as it were, a counterpoise to the assertions of the Bolshevists. Their services will be indispensable for the purpose of indicating to the members of the Commission persons whose testimony they would otherwise certainly fail to obtain, and also for the purpose of bringing before them facts which otherwise might easily be concealed from them by the Bolshevists. If the enquiry is to be impartial, it must hear the evidence on both sides. As one side will certainly be represented, it is right that the other should also appear.2. The anti-Bolshevist Russians must not merely accompany the Commission of Enquiry into Russia. They must be enabled to serve the interests of the enquiry without risk of being arrested, shot or otherwise molested. The League of Nations will have to guarantee their inviolability. A formal assurance must be obtained from the Bolshevists on this subject. Should this pledge nevertheless be broken, such violation must be established and considered as sufficient to establish the judgment and condemnation of the Bolshevist cause.3. Lastly, it is indispensable to guarantee the inviolability of all those who undertake the risk of making statements which are unfavourable to Bolshevist rule, and this guarantee should include their families. Without this guarantee the enquiry will only be a decoy. Further, all those who, after having given testimony before the Commission, desire to leave Russia should receive a guarantee as to the possibility of doing so, and of taking with them any resources at their disposal as a means of livelihood. Those unwilling or unable to leave Russia should remain under the protection of the League of Nations, and be named on a special list. In case these witnesses should be the victims of vengeance on the part of the Bolshevists, the same penalty should be applied as in reference to point 2, i.e., this vengeance should be recorded and considered as sufficient ground for the judgment and condemnation of the Bolshevist cause. &apos;  &apos;
