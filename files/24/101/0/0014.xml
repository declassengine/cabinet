3U?3BMr] OOUHOII. TREATY OF PEACE V&apos;ITH TUP.KCT $-b. ^ G AiJLi      REPORT OF THE ECONOMIC COMMISSION. A.J.127.The Economic Commission entrusted with the duty of, preparing draft economic clauses for insertion in tho Treaty of Peace with Turkey have already submitted the result of their deliberations in the form of draft clauses, which were approved by the Conference of Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers, on tho 18th Llarch, so far as they had boon agreed in the Commission.   The Commission have now reached agreement upon the clauses which remained for discussion, and upon certain additional clauses; and beg to submit tho complete Text of the Economic Part of the Treaty as unanimously adopted by them.   The clauses which have not already been&apos; approved by the Conference are those numbered 28, 35, 36, 41, 49, 50, 50A 50B, 502,and 52 in the present Text.   Articles 35 and 36 are still subject to consideration by the French and Italian Delegations,In addition, a small modification has been agreed upon in paragraph 2 of tho Annex following Article 48 (relating to contracts) and the final sentence- of paragraph 11 of that Annex has been deleted.   Article 34 of the former text has been deleted since it is understood to be covered by an Article in the Financial Clauses.   The. second paragraph of Article 32 has been modified at the instance of the Financial Commission.The Commission desire to draw the attention of the Conference of Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers to various matters raised in connection with tbe discussion of the economic clauses, the settlement of which goes beyond the competence of the Economic Commission.)(l)     They have not included in the clauses prepared by them any provision relating to the future judicial regime in Turkey,
3inco it Is understood, that this natter is being--considered by the legal exports.   The Commission, venture, however to emphasise the view that in the interests of commerce it is desirable that some Article should be inserted for securing judicial sanction for the immediate extension to all the Allied-and Associated Powers Signatories to the Treaty of the benefit of the capitulatory regime.They also suggest that in some appropriate part of the Treaty there should be a stipulation validating any decisions given by Consular Courts in Turkey during the war and covering also the proceedings of any inter-Allied tribunal temporarily established to deal with mixed cases r.(2)   The Commission have included in the clauses put forward by them an Article (Article 2 ) relative to renunciation by Turkey of rights of suzerainty over Mussulmans not Turkish sub-$ects. but they recognise.....that the importance of this clauseextends beyond the economic sphere and that it may be thought preferable to transfer it to another part of the treaty(3)   In respect of Article 4,the Commission desire to place on record their opinion that the Financial Commission to be established should, so far as possible, abstain from imposing export prohibitions or export duties on raw materials produced in Turkey,(4)   The Commission venture to suggest that, in view of the special circumstances existing in the case of Turkey, Article 8 relating to the acoAuis&apos;itlon of new nationality should be sub-mitted to the Committee on the Protection of Minorities in order that that Committee may consider whether any addition to the Article is required from their point of view.   Article 29 should also be referred to the Committee on Minorities.(5)   In Articles 25., 24. and 25   (in the Section dealing with Industrial Property) there are included, as in the corresponding Articles in other Treaties, special references to the United
States .   In the--event--of&quot;&quot;th^-TJnlt^a Signatory of the Treaty with Turkey, these referenc-es&apos; should presumably be deleted.(5)   The Commission are of opinion that, in the event of any territory being detached from the Turkish Empire In the district of Smyrna an exception on the lines of Article 267 of the Treaty of Peace with Austria should be made to the provisions of Article 35 regarding the liquidation of property of Turkish companies.   Such an exception should no doubt appear in the special clauses relating to this district.(7)   An exception from Article 45 (in the Section dealing with contracts, prescriptions and judgments) is made as regards Japan, similar to the exception made^in paragraph (c) of Article 299 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany.   This exception will require to be emended to cover the United States of America and Brazil in the event of either or both of these Powers being signatory to the Treaty with Turkey.H.A.  PAYNE. Chairman, Economic Commission-March 26th, 1920.
. E ToteJTBRIT I fflMffiGAT lOfl.It appears desirable in the interests of the efficient and expeditious handling of postal traffic between the Allied Countries and Turkey that the right enjoyed before the war as part of the Capitulatory Regime., to maintain post-offices !h Turkey, should be re-established under the Treaty of le&amp;ee. This right was based upon the Treaty of Commerce between Turkey and russia of 1783, and that between Turkey and Austria of 1784-, and was enjoyed by other Powers entitled to the Capitulatory icegime in VL$ue of their right to most-favoure-d-nation treatment.     On the suppression of the Capitulatory Regime by unilateral act of thelerto in September 1914, all foreign post-offices in Turkey were closed by the TurkishGovernmentoIn these circumstances, it may be desirable that specific reference should be made to the right to maintain post-offices in Article I of the Economic Clauses, and it is suggested that the opening aards of this Article should be modified to read as follows:-&quot;The Capitulatory hegirae resulting from Treaties. Conventions and Usages, including the right to establish and ma lot a in pcst-sfff ices, shall be re-established27*3*20.
EXTRACT m(M 1.0.5?. 88.79(7) The Conference had before them the Proposed Economic Clauses in the Treaty of Peace with Turkey ((A.J.97 Revise ) together with a Import by the Chairmanof the Economic Commission (A. J.187) (appendix I).LORD GViiZCti said he understood there vat substantialrival of;t Offices,   agrooraoni to the Draft Clauses of the Economic Chapter.Subject to any observations by the Chairman of the CommiseiO): and any remarks his colleagues might wish to make, he thoughtmake one small alteration in article 1, in such a way as to maintain the lost Offices established by the allied Powers h Turkey,   He had circulated a Note on the subject (Appendix IT hTKK MARQUIc&apos; IL PEEIALI said he thought it was important to ljm.it the right of reviving lost Offices to the Powers which had lost Offices in Turkey before August 1, 1914.   If the field were left open for other Allied lowers to set up lost OfI ices, great difficulties would ensue.M. CAI/BOE observed that Turkey had al1 ays resisted those Ioet Offices, and had at various times attempted to have them closed.LOKD CUR2CN said that he was informed that the right to establish Poet Offices in Turkey by other Powers arose fn most-favoured-nation right s.THE ivLiLQ/J IS ILihlJiiLI said that he thought the right was based on no document whatever.     It was a right asserted against continual opposition from the Porte, whici on one occasion had forcibly closed the British Post Office.   This had led to a diplomatic incident of some gravity.   Moreover he thought it was undesirable to remove from the Turkish Government all means of raising revenue b$ postal services.- M EAMviEldiiR said he thought it was desirable to revive the lost Offices.     The right might be limited in tfcthat the question could be dealt with without any veryrainute examination.Article 1.Mr, PAYM&amp; said that the British Delegation wished to
Article itself to the rowers which had established them before the lar.LQKI) QUE20K thought it v.as p&amp;rimps inadvisable to insert a -pie st ion of this kind in the very first article, which dealt with matters of great importanoe.   He thought a separate article would be more appropriate.VIbCCUWT CHIiiflV. said that if the revival of lost Offices was regarded as part of the restoration of the Cap it-ulationu. all the signatories to the Treaty should be bene-beneficiaries.Ivir.7iu^jITlVKT observed that the right of maintaining lost Offices had always been much contested, and was not really the result of the Capitulations.VISCOUNT CHIUDA said that though Japan had had no Post Off loss in Turkey before, if she was now to enjoy most-favoured-nation   treatment, the denial of the right to eatab-lish lost Offices would appear to be somewhat of a paradox. Ho suggested that the expression &quot;-irincipal Allied Powers&quot; might be used,    (something similar had boon done in the Treaty with Bulgaria in connection, not with lost offices in particular, but with the Capitulations,lord 0UI\2CU said that he understood that lost Officeshad no connection with Capitulations; that the privilege had been enjoyed by certain Powers in spite of considerable difficulties, involving at times forcible pressure.   He thought that if now lost Offices were created the troublewould be enhanced.VIbCUUM1 OH 113DA said, that, in view of the commentsmade b; his colleagues, he withdrew his proposal.It vas decided  To ask the Drafting Committee to insert an r.rticlo providing for the -re-establish-ment of lost v-ificos by such Allied Power a as nad lost Offices in Turkey bofore August 1, 1914ctides MI:. PAYIiffi said that nearly all the articles had been before the uo life re nee, with the exception of a very few concerning which reservations had be-n made.   Of these, all but Articles 35 and 36 had been settled.   These two were
still subject &quot;to reservations by the Italian and French Delegations.   He did not know whether these reservations could now be withdrawn.M, SCIALCIA said that the Italian Delegation felt bound to maintain its reservation regarding Article 36.M, KAKF1RFR said the French Delegation was of likemi nd.LOTQ) CUHZOH asked when these Articles could be con-side r e d by th o C o nf e r en ce..M. KAIviHTilRER said he hoped to get the answer of the French Government at the same time as the answer regarding the Financial Glauses.M* bGlAJjUJA said that the question had a political Character;   he could not settle it without consultation of M. Nitti.   He thought it would probably have to be reserved, therefore, for the meeting at ban Remo.     The Article had a wide tearing on the whole question of railways.   .LORD GURZOJS said it was very unfortunate.    that this matter should be postponed foi the meeting at oan itemo. There would not be much time at pan Remo, and all the exports would not be present.   He understood the meeting there would discuss the general bases of the Treaty, and not its details. Moreover, he thought this Conference ought to be able to settle a question of this kind without reference to the Supreme Council.   He asked whether M. Scialoja could not obtain a reply by the following Thursday.-m, SCIALOJA said that the question was, perhaps, themost important to Italy of all the questions involved in this chapter,   He would telegraph to Italy, but could not promise.that he would, be able to reply on Thursday.It was agreed  That the question of article 36 should be postponed.M. KAMiBRER said that he had a very small point toraise regarding Article 3.   &apos;xhe third paragraph of thisArticle, as at present drafted, named a period of three months
&apos;   1 The French Government thought this period was too&apos; short, a*dwould bo glad to see it altered to six months.MRvPAYNE said he saw no objection, and presumed thatthis would carry a similar alteration in Article 4.i MJCA^ERER agreed.M*SOIALOJi said he had no objection.It was therefore agreed:.-To substitute &quot;six months&quot; for &quot;three months&quot; in Articles Z and 4.icle 4. M.SCIALOJA said that he had a small observation to make,regarding Article 4,     The second paragraph authorised the Financial Commission to prohibit imports and exports.     In the third paragraph of the Report U. J.-127) the Chairman of thej Commission expressed the opinion that it was desirable to abstain from imposing prohibitions on the export of raw material, He was entirely himself Of that opinion, and thought that it might be desirable to limit the Article in that sense.MR.PAYNE said that the Commission recognised that it might be necessary to exercise such a right, though it was undesirable to do so.     He thought it was difficult to state in the Article itself any limitation of the Financial Commissions power to take action.M.3CIAL0JA pointed out that the chairman Report j might be lost sight of, and that the Financial commission might not feel restrained by his excellent advicetLORD curzon said that he did not think it was very easy to insert a restriction in the Treaty.     There would, however, be an Italian representative on the Financial Commission, receiving instructions from his Government.    His Government, would doubtless instruct him to resist any prohibition on theOexoort of raw material from Turkey, and he would, if necessary, araw attention to the Report.     He thought this was a sufficient guarantee against any undue exercise of the right.M.KAMM3RER said that the French Delegation sympathised with the views of JLScialoga, but had not thought it possible
I to insert any restrictive Clause in the Treaty.I M.SCIALOJA said he thought a sentence might beattached to the Artiole to the effect that prohibitionsregarding the export of raw material from Turkey should beof a temporary and exceptional character;     This wouldembody in the Treaty itself the opinion expressed in the Report.LORD GURiiOM said that ho had much sympathy with M.Scialojain this matter;   but, as the Financial Commission to be set upin Turkey would bo faced with great difficulties, he thoughtit was hardly fair to them to tie their hands.     He thought theuse of this power should bo left to their discretion.M.2A!vSiERSR said that he thought M.Scialoja might foregothis insertion.    The Financial Commission would know that! Europe needed raw materials;   it would only resort to pro-hibition in very exceptional circumstances.     In any caseall its members would be in close touch with their Governments.M. NO GAR A pointed out that in all the other/Treaties thePowers had abstained, from inserting any provision regardingprohibition.     The Italian Government was not objecting tothe levy of dues on exports or imports, but merely wished tosafeguard the free flow of raw materials.M.SCIALOJA said that he would not insist on his proposal,but he would like it recorded in the Minutes that the Conferenceendorsed the recommendation made in the Report (section 3)I regarding the desi rability of abstaining from prohibitions   onthe export of raw materials produced in Turkey.LORD CURSOR said he had no objection to this, and agreed that it should be recorded that in the discussion the members of the Conference had taken note of section 2 of ) the Report, and had agreed with the recommendation madetherein regarding prohibitions, ,Remaining MR.PAY HE said that he had nothing to add regarding theArticles.remaining Articles, except that some of them referred to inthe Report required reference to other Commissions.
M.XAMMIi)K.SB said that Article 8, for instance, could now be suppressed, as the subject was oovered by a Chapter framed by the Commission on Nationalities.MKPAYJK observed, that this probably applied also to Article 29.It was/agreedThat the Drafting.Committee should be asked to examine whether Articles 8 and 29 were now redundant.MR.IAOT said that the attention of the drafting committee should also be drawn to Articles 23, 24 and 25.With the comments recorded above, the whole of the Articles (A.J.-97) together with the report (A.J.-1S7) were referred, with the general approval of the Conference, to the Drafting Committae.M.CAMD0K observed that the approval of the french delegation must be understood to be ad referendum.(The Conference ad$pursedat 5-0.5 P^nnjK2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 29Dh Maroh, 1920.

Industrial Property.Article 22. Subject to the stipulations of the present Treaty, rights of industrial, literary and artistic property, as such property is defined by the International Conventions of Paris and of Berne mentioned in Article 13, shall be re-established or restored, as from the coming into force of the present Treaty, in the territories of the High Contracting Parties, in favour of the persons entitled to the benefit of them at the moment when the state of war commenced, or their legal representatives. Equally, rights which, except for the war, would have been acquired during the war in consequence of an application made for the protection of industrial property, or the publication of a literary or artistic work, shall be recognised and established in favour of those persons who would have been entitled thereto, from the coming into force of the present Treaty.Nevertheless, all acts done by virtue of the special measures taken during the war under legislative, executive or administrative authority of any Allied or Associated Power in regard to the rights of Turkish nationals in industrial, literary or artistic property shall remain in force and shall continue to maintain their full effect.No claim shall be made or action brought by Turkey or Turkish nationals in respect of the use during the war by the Government of any Allied or Associated Power, or by any person acting on behalf or with the assent of such Government, of any rights in industrial, literary or artistic property, nor in respect of the sale, offering for sale, or use of any products, articles or apparatus whatsoever to which such rights applied.Unless the legislation of any one of the Allied or Associated Powers in force at the moment of the signature of the present Treaty otherwise directs, sums due or paid in virtue of any act or operation resulting from the execution of the special measures mentioned in the second paragraph of this Article shall be dealt with in the same way as other sums due to Turkish nationals are directed to be dealt with bythe present Treaty ; and sums produced by any special measures taken by the Turkish Government in respect of rights in industrial, literary or artistic property belonging to the nationals of the Allied or Associated Powers shall be considered and treated in the same way as other debts due from Turkish nationals.Each of the Allied and Associated Powers reserves to itself the right to impose . such limitations, conditions or restrictions on rights of industrial, literary or artistic property (with the exception of. trade marks) acquired before or during the war, or which may be subsequently acquired in accordance with its legislation, by Turkish nationals, whether by granting licences, or by the working, or by preserving control over their exploitation, or in any other way, as may be considered necessary for national defence, or in the public interest, or for assuring the fair treatment by Turkey of the rights of industrial, literary and artistic property held in Turkish territory by its nationals, or for securing the due fulfilment of all the obligations undertaken by Turkey in the present Treaty. As regards rights of industrial, literary and artistic property acquired after the coming into force of the present Treaty, the right so reserved by the Allied and Associated Powers shall only be exercised in cases where these limitations, conditions or restrictions may be considered necessary for national defence or in the public interest.In the event of the application of the provisions of the preceding paragraph by any Allied or Associated Power, there shall be paid reasonable indemnities or royalties, [2739] 0
which shall be dealt with in the same way as other sums due to Turkish nationals are directed to be dealt with by the present Treaty.Each of the Allied or Associated Powers reserves the right to treat as void and of no effect any transfer in whole or in part of or other dealing with rights of or in respect of industrial, literary or artistic property effected after the 1st August, 1914, or in the future, which would have the result of defeating the objects of the provisions of this article. - ,The provisions of this article shall not apply to rights in industrial, literary or artistic property which have been dealt with in the liquidation of businesses or companies under war legislation by the Allied or Associated Powers, or which may be so dealt with by virtue of Article 30.&apos;Article 23. A minimum of one year after the coming into force of the present Treaty shall be accorded to the nationals of the High Contracting Parties, without extension fees or other penalty, in order to enable such persons to accomplish any act, fulfil any formality, pay any fees, and generally satisfy any obligation prescribed by the laws or regulations of the respective States relating to the obtaining, preserving or opposing rights to, or in respect of, industrial property either acquired before the 1st August, 1914, or which, except for the war, might have been acquired since that date as a result of an application made before the war or during its continuance ; but nothing in this article shall give any right to reopen interference proceedings in the United States of America where a final hearing has taken place.All rights in, or in respect of, such property which may have lapsed by reason of any failure to accomplish any act, fulfil auy formality, or make any payment, shall revive, but subject in the case of patents and designs to the imposition of such conditions as each Allied or Associated Power may deem reasonably necessary for the protection of persons who have manufactured or made use of the subject-matter of such property while the rights had lapsed. Further, where rights to patents or designs belonging to Turkish nationals are revived under this article, they shall be subject in respect of the grant of licences to the same provisions as would have been applicable to them during the war, as well as to all the provisions of the present Treaty.The period from the 1st August, 1914, until the coming into force of the present Treaty shall be excluded in considering the time within which a patent should be worked or a trade-mark or design used, and it is further agreed that no patent^ registered trade-mark or design in force on the 1st August, 1914, shall be subject to revocation or cancellation by reason only of the failure to work such patent or use such trade-mark or design for two years after the coming into force of the present Treaty.Article 24. No action shall be brought and no claim made by persons residing or carrying on business within the territories of Turkey on the one part and of the Allied or Associated Powers on the other, or persons who are nationals of such Powers respectively, or by anyone deriving title during the war from such persons, by reason of any action which has taken place within the territory of the other party between the date of the existence of a state of war and that of the coming into force of the present Treaty, which might constitute an infringement of the rights of industrial property or rights of literary and artistic property, either existing at any time during the war or revived under the provisions of Article 23.Equally, no action for infringement of industrial, literary or artistic property rights by such persons shall at &quot;any time be permissible in respect of the sale or offering for sale for a period of one year after the signature of the present Treaty in the territories of the Allied or Associated Powers on the one hand, or Turkey on the other, of products or articles manufactured, or of literary or artistic works published, during the period between the existence of a state of war and the signature of the present Treaty,, or against those who have acquired and continue to use them.

the date of the existence of a state of war between Turkey and the Allied or Associated Power. But in any case the former beneficiary of a contract of this kind shall have the right, within a period of six months after the coming into force of the present Treaty, to demand from the proprietor of the rights the grant of a new licence, the conditions of which, in default of agreement between the parties, shall be fixed by the duly qualified tribunal in the country under whose legislation the rights had ,been acquired, except in the case of licences held in respect of rights acquired under Turkish law. Tn such cases the conditions shall be fixed by the Arbitral Commission referred to in Article 28 of this part. The tribunal or commission may, if necessary, fix also the amount which it may deem just should be paid by reason of the use of the rights during the war.No licence in respect of industrial, literary or artistic property granted under the special Avar legislation of any Allied or Associated Power shall be affected by the continued existence of any licence entered into before the war, but shall, remain valid and of full effect, and a licence so granted to the former beneficiary of a licence entered into before the war shall be considered as substituted for such licence.Where sums have been paid during the war by virtue of a licence or agreement concluded before the -war in respect of rights of industrial property or for the reproduction or the representation of literary, dramatic or artistic works, these sums shall be dealt with in the same manner as other debts or credits of Turkish nationals as provided by the present Treaty.This Article shall not apply as between the United States of America on the one hand and Turkey on the other.Article 26. The inhabitants of territories transferred under the present Treaty shall, notwithstanding this transfer and the change of nationality consequent thereon, continue to enjoy in Turkey all the rights in industrial, literary and artistic property to which they were entitled under Turkish legislation at the time of the transfer.Rights of industrial, literary and artistic property which are in force in the territories transferred under the present Treaty at the moment of their transfer from Turkey, or which will be re-established or restored in accordance with the provisions of Article 22, shall be recognised by the State to which the said territory is transferred, and shall remain in force in that territory for the same period of time given them under the Turkish law.Article 27.

The original insurer will, however, be entitled to receive on demand full information as to the terms of the transfer, and if it should appear that these terms were not equitable, they shall be amended so far as may be necessary to render them equitable.Furthermore, the insured shall, subject to the concurrence of the original insurer, be entitled to retransfer the contract to the original insurer as from the date of the demand.9.Life Insurance.Contracts of -life insurance entered into between an insurer and a person who subsequently became an enemy shall not be deemed to have been dissolved by the outbreak of war or by the fact of the person becoming an enemy.Any sum which during the war became due upon a contract deemed not to have been dissolved under the preceding provision shall be recoverable after the war with the addition of interest at 5 per cent, per annum from the date of its becoming due up to the day of payment.Where the contract has lapsed during the war owing to non-payment of premiums, or has become void from breach of the conditions of the contract, the assured or his representatives or the persons entitled shall have the right at any time within twelve months of the coming into force of the present Treaty to claim from the insurer the surrender value of the policy at the date of its lapse or avoidance.10.Where contracts of life insurance have been entered into by a local branch of an insnrance company established in a country which subsequently became an enemy country, the contract shall, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary in the contract itself, be governed by the local law, but the insurer shall be entitled to demand from the insured or his representatives the refund of sums paid or claims made or enforced under measures taken during the war, if the making or enforcement of such claims was not in accordance with the terms of the contract itself or was not consistent with the laws or treaties existing at the time when it was entered into.11.In any case where by the law applicable to the contract the insurer remains bound by the contract, notwithstanding the non-payment of premiums, until notice is given to the insured of the termination of the contract, he shall be entitled where the giving of such notice was prevented by the war to recover the unpaid premiums with interest at 5 per cent, per annum from the insured.
12.Insurance contracts shall be considered as contracts of life assurance for the purpose of paragraphs 9 to 11 when they depend ou the probabilities of human life combined with the rate of interest for the calculation of the reciprocal engagements between the two parties.13.Marine Insurance.Contracts ot marine insurance, including time policies and voyage policies, entered into between an insurer and a person who subsequently became an enemy, shall be deemed to have been dissolved on his becoming an enemy, except in cases where the risk undertaken in the contract had attached before he became an enemy.Where the risk had not attached, money paid by way of premium or otherwise shall be recoverable from the insurer.Where the risk had attached effect shall be given to the contract, notwithstanding the party becoming an enemy, and sums due under the contract either by way of premiums or in respect of losses shall be recoverable after the coming into force of the present Treaty.In the event of any agreement being come to for the payment of interest on sums due before the war to or by the nationals of States which have been at war and recovered after the war, such interest shall in the case of losses recoverable under contracts of marine insurance run from the expiration of a period of one year from the date of the loss.14.No contract of marine insurance with an insured person who subsequently became an enemy shall be deemed to cover losses due to belligerent action by the Power of which the insurer was a national or by the allies or associates of such Power.15.Where it is shown that a person who had before the war entered into a contract of marine insurance with an insurer who subsequently became an enemy entered after the outbreak of war into a new contract covering the same risk with an insurer who was not an enemy, the new contract shall be deemed to be substituted for the original contract as from the date when it was entered into, and the premiums payable shall be adjusted on the basis of the original insurer having remained liable on the contract only up till the time when the new contract was entered into.16.Other Insurances.Contracts of insurance entered into before the war between an insurer and a person who subsequently became an enemy, other than contracts dealt with in paragraphs 7 to 15, shall be treated in all respects on the same footing as contracts of fire insurance between the same persons would be dealt with under the said paragraphs.17.Reinsurance.All Treaties of reinsurance with a person who became an enemy shall be regarded as having been abrogated by the person becoming an enemy, but without prejudice in the case of life or marine risk which had attached before the war to the right to recover payment after the war for sums due in respect of such risks.Nevertheless, if, owing to invasion, it has been impossible for the reinsured to find another reinsurer, the Treaty shall remain in force until three months after the coining into force of the present Treaty.Where a reinsurance Treaty becomes void under this paragraph there shall be an adjustment of accounts between the parties in respect both of premiums paid and payable and of liabilities for losses in respect of life or marine risk which had attached before the war. In the case of risks other than those mentioned in paragraphs 9 to 15, the adjustment of accounts shall be made as at the date of the parties becoming enemies, without regard to claims for losses which may have occurred since that date.18.The provisions of the preceding paragraph will extend equally to reinsurances existing at the date of the parties becoming enemies of particular risks undertaken by the insurer in a contract of insurance against any risk other than life or marine risks.19.Eeinsurance of life risks effected by particular contracts and not under any general treaty remain in force.

which shall be dealt with in the same way as other sums due to Turkish nationals are directed to be dealt with by the present Treaty.Each of the Allied or Associated Powers reserves the right to treat as void and of no effect any transfer in whole or in part of or other dealing with rights of or in respect of industrial, literary or artistic property effected after the 1st August, 1914, or in the future, which would have the result of defeating the objects of the provisions of this article.The provisions of this article shall not apply to rights in industrial, literary or artistic property which have been dealt with in the liquidation of businesses or companies under war legislation by the Allied or Associated Powers, or which may be so dealt with by virtue of Article 30.Article 23. A minimum of one year after the coming into force of the present Treaty shall be accorded to the nationals of the High Contracting Parties, without extension fees or other penalty, in order to enable such persons to accomplish any act, fulfil any formality, pay any fees, and generally satisfy any obligation prescribed by the laws or regulations of the respective States relating to the obtaining, preserving or opposing rights to, or in respect of, industrial property either acquired before the 1st August, 1914, or which, except for the war, might have been acquired since that date as a result of an application made before the war or during its continuance ; but nothing in this article shall give any right to reopen interference proceedings in the United States of America where a final hearing has taken place.All rights in, or in respect of, such property which may have lapsed by reason of any failure to accomplish any act, fulfil any formality, or make any payment, shall revive, but subject in the case of patents and designs to the imposition of such conditions as each Allied or Associated Power may deem reasonably necessary for the protection of persons who have manufactured or made use of the subject-matter of such property while the rights had lapsed. Further, where rights to patents or designs belonging to Turkish nationals are revived under this article, they shall be subject in respect of the grant of licences to the same provisions as would have been applicable to them during the war, as well as to all the provisions of the present Treaty.The period from the 1st August, 1914, until the coming into force of the present Treaty shall be excluded in considering the time within which a patent should be worked or a trade-mark or design used, and it is further agreed that no patent, registered trade-mark or design in force on the 1st August, 1914, shall be subject to revocation or cancellation by reason only of the failure to work such patent or use such trade-mark or design for two years after the coming into force of the present Treaty.Article 24. No action shall be brought and no claim made by persons residing or carrying on business within the territories of Turkey on the one part and of the Allied or Associated Powers on the other, or persons who are nationals of such Powers respectively, or by anyone deriving title during the war from such persons, by reason of any action which has taken place within the territory of the other party between the date of the existence of a state of war and that of the coming into force of the present Treaty, which might constitute an infringement of the rights of industrial property or rights of literary and artistic property, either existing at any time during the war or revived under the provisions of Article 23.Equally, no action for infringement of industrial, literary or artistic property rights by such persons shall at any time be permissible in respect of the sale or offering for sale for a period of one year after the signature of the present Treaty in the territories of the Allied or Associated Powers on the one hand, or Turkey on the other, of products or articles manufactured, or of literary or artistic works published, during the period between the existence of a state of war and the signature of the present Treaty, or against those who have acquired and continue to use them. It is understood, nevertheless, that this provision shall not apply when the possessor of the rights was domiciled or had an industrial or commercial establishment in the districts occupied by Turkey during the war.This Article shall not apply as between the United States of America on the one hand and Turkey on the other.Article 25. Licences in respect of industrial, literary or artistic property concluded before the war between nationals of the Allied or Associated Powers or persons residing in their territory or carrying on business therein on the one part, and Turkish nationals on the other part, shall be considered as cancelled as from
the date of the existence of a state of war between Turkey and the Allied or Associated Power. But in any case the former beneficiary of a contract of this kind shall have the right, within a.period, of six months&apos; after the coming into force of the present Treaty, to demand from the proprietor of the rights the grant of a new licence, the conditions of which, in default of agreement between the parties, shall be fixed by the duly qualified tribunal, in the country under whose legislation the rights had been acquired, except in the case of licences held in respect of rights acquired under Turkish law. In such cases the conditions shall be fixed by the Arbitral Commission referred to in Article 28 of this part. The tribunal or commission may, if necessary, fix also the amount which it may deem just should be paid by reason of the use of the rights during the war.No licence in respect of industrial, literary or artistic property granted under the special war legislation of any Allied or Associated Power shall be affected by the continued existence of any licence entered into before the war, but shall remain valid and of full effect, and a licence so granted to the former beneficiary of a licence entered into before the war shall be considered as substituted for such licence.Where sums have been paid during the war by virtue of a licence or agreement concluded before the war in respect of rights of industrial property or for the reproduction or the representation of literary, dramatic or artistic works, these sums shall be dealt with in the same manner as other debts or credits of Turkish nationals as provided by the present Treaty.This Article shall not apply as between the United States of America on the one hand and Turkey on the other.Article 26. The inhabitants of territories transferred under the present Treaty shall, notwithstanding this transfer and the change of nationality consequent thereon, continue to enjoy in Turkey all the rights in industrial, literary and artistic property to which they were entitled under Turkish legislation at the time of the transfer.Rights of industrial, literary and artistic property which are in force in the territories transferred under the present Treaty at the moment of their transfer from Turkey, or which will be re-established or restored in accordance with the provisious of Article 22, shall be recognised by the State to which the said territory is transferred, and shall remain in force in that territory for the same period of time given them under the Turkish law.Article 27. A special Convention shall determine all questions relative to the records, registers and copies in connection with the protection of industrial, literary or artistic property, and fix their eventual transmission or communication by the Turkish offices to the offices of the States to which Turkish, territory is transferred.Section IV.-Property, Rights and Interests[Article 28. The property, rights and interests situated in territory which was under Turkish sovereignty on the 1st August, 1914, of nationals of Allied or Associated Powers who w^ere not during the war Ottoman nationals, or of companies controlled by them, shall be immediately restored to their owners free of all taxes levied by or under the authority of the Turkish Government or Authorities except such as would have been leviable in accordance with the Capitulations. Where property has been confiscated during the war or sequestrated in such a way that its owners enjoyed no benefit therefrom, it shall be restored free of all taxes whatever. The Turkish Government shall take such steps as may be within its power to restore the owner to the possession of his property free from all encumbrances or burdens with which it may have been charged without his assent. It shall indemnify all third parties injured by the restitution.If the restitution provided for in this Article cannot be effected, or if the property, rights or interests have been damaged or injured, whether they have been seized or not, the owner shall be entitled to compensation. Claims made in this respect by the nationals of Allied or Associated Powers or by companies controlled by them shall be investigated and the total of the compensation shall be determined by an Arbitral Commission to be appointed by the Council of the League of Nations. This compensation shall be borne by the Turkish Government and may be charged upon the property of Ottoman nationals within the territory or under the control of the claimants&apos; State. So far as it is not met from this source it shall be satisfied out of the annuity referred to in Article 5 (ii) of the Financial Clauses.
This clause shall not impose any obligation on the Turkish Government to pay compensation in respect of damage to property, rights and interests effected since the date of the Armistice in territory in the effective occupation of the Allies and detached from Turkey by this Treaty. Compensation for any actual damage on such property, rights and interests inflicted by the occupying authorities since the Armistice shall be a charge on [the State exercising authority in such detached territory] or [the Allied armies responsible].Article 29. The property, rights and interests in Turkey of former Ottoman nationals who acquire ipso facto the nationality of an Allied or Associated Power or of a newly-created State in accordance with the provisions of the present Treaty or any further Treaty to which the Allied&apos; and Associated Powers are parties settling the disposal of territories detached from the Ottoman Empire, shall be restored to them in their actual condition.Artile 30. Subject to any contrary stipulations which may be provided in the present Treaty, the Allied and Associated Powers, reserve the right to retain and liquidate all property, rights and interests of Ottoman nationals, or companies controlled by them, within their territories, colonies, possessions and protectorates, not including any territory under Ottoman sovereignty at the 1st August, 1914.The liquidation shall be carried out in accordance with the laws of the Allied or Associated Power concerned, and the Ottoman owner shall not be able to dispose of such property, rights or interests, or to subject them to any charge, without the consent of that Power.Article 31. Ottoman nationals who acquire ipso facto the nationality of an Allied or Associated Power or of a newly-created State in accordance with the provisions of the present Treaty, or any further Treaty to which the Allied and Associated Powers are parties settling the disposal of territories detached from the Ottoman Empire, will not be considered as Ottoman nationals within the meaning of Articles 23, 25, 30, 32, 33, 35, 40,. 41 and 47. or the fifth paragraph of Article 22, or the second paragraph of Article 28.Article 32. All property, rights and interests of Ottoman nationals within the territory of any Allied or Associated Power, not including any territory under Ottoman sovereignty at the 1st August, 1914, and the net proceeds of their sale, liquidation or other dealing therewith may be charged by that Allied or Associated Power with payment of amounts due in respect of claims by the nationals of that Allied or Associated Power under Article 28 or in respect of debts owing to them by Ottoman nationals.Any property, rights or interests or the proceeds of their liquidation not used as provided in Articles 30 and 32 shall be restored to the owners.Article 33. The Turkish Government undertakes to compensate its nationals in respect of the sale or retention of their property, rights or interests in Allied or Associated States.Article 34.

In all such cases the proceeds of the liquidation shall be paid direct to the company.The present Article shall not apply to companies in which Allied or Associated nationals, including those of the mandatory State had, on the 1st August, 1914, a preponderant interest.[The provisions of the first paragraph of this Article relating to the payment of the proceeds of liquidation to the owner do not apply in the case of public utility under-takings or concessions where the owner is an Ottoman company in which the majority of the capital or the control is held by German, Austrian, Hungarian or Bulgarian nationals either directly or through their interests in a company controlled by them or was so held on the 1st August, 1914. In such case the proceeds of the liquidation may, at the option of the Government administering the territory, either be paid to the owner or be distributed among the persons directly or indirectly interested in the company, the proportion attributable to the interests of the nationals of Germany, Austria, Hungary or Bulgaria being paid to the Reparation Commission established under the Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and the State in question.]

The Turkish Government shall, on the demand of the Principal Allied Powers signatory of the present Treaty, take over the undertaking, property, rights and interests of any Ottoman company holding a railway concession in Turkish territory as it results from the present Treaty, and shall transfer the said undertaking, property, rights and interests together with any interest of the Turkish Government in the line or in the undertaking in accordance with the advice of the Financial Commission, at a price to be fixed by an arbitrator nominated by the Council of the League of Nations. The amount of this price shall be received by the Financial Commission and shall be distributed by it in the same manner as is provided in Article 35 in the case of the liquidation of public utility undertakings owned by Ottoman nationals in the transferred territories, except that the proportion of the price attributable to the interest of the Turkish Government shall be retained by the Financial Commission for the purposes referred to in Article 5 of the Financial Clauses.]Article 37. Until the expiration of a period of six months from the coming into force of the present Treaty, the Turkish Government will effectively prohibit all dealings with the property, rights and interests within its territory, which belong, at the date of the coming into force of the Treaty, to Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, or their nationals, except in so far as may be necessary for the carrying into effect of the provisions of Article 260 of the Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany or any corresponding provision in the Treaty of Peace with Austria, Hungary or Bulgaria.Subject to any special stipulations in the present Treaty affecting property of the Governments of these States, the Turkish Government will proceed to liquidate any of the property, rights or interests above referred to which may be notified to it within the period above mentioned by the principal x\llied and Associated Powers signatory of the present Treaty, and the prohibition of dealing with such property shall be maintained until the liquidation is completed.

The original insurer will, however, be entitled to receive on demand full information as to the terms of the transfer, and if it should appear that these terms were not equitable, they shall be amended so far as may be necessary to render them equitable.Furthermore, the insured shall, subject to the concurrence of the original insurer, be entitled to retransfer the contract to the original insurer as from the date of the demand.9.Life Insurance.Contracts of life insurance entered into between an insurer and a person who subsequently became an enemy shall not be deemed to have been dissolved by the outbreak of war or by the fact of the person becoming an enemy.Any sum which during the war became due upon a contract deemed not to have been dissolved under the preceding provision shall be recoverable after the war with the addition of interest at 5 per cent, per annum from the date of its becoming due up to the day of payment.Where the contract has lapsed during the war owing to non-payment of premiums, or has become void from breach of the conditions of the contract, the assured or his representatives or the persons entitled shall have the right at any time within twelve months of the coming into force of the present Treaty to claim from the insurer the surrender value of the policy at the date of its lapse or avoidance.Where the contract has lapsed during the war owing to non-payment of premiums, the payment of which has been prevented by the enforcement of measures of war, the assured or his representative or the persons entitled shall have the right to restore the contract on payment of the premiums, with interest at 5 per cent, per annum, within three months from the coming into force of the present Treaty.10.Where contracts of life insurance have been entered into by a local branch of an insurance-company established in a country which subsequently became an enemy country, the contract shall, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary in the contract itself, be governed by the local law,, but the insurer shall be entitled to demand from the insured or his representatives the refund of sums paid or claims made or enforced under measures taken during the war, if the making or enforcement of such claims was not in accordance with the terms of the contract itself or was not consistent with the laws or treaties existing at the time when it was entered into.11.In any case where by the law applicable to the contract the insurer remains bound by the contract, notwithstanding the non-payment of premiums, until notice is given to the insured of the termination of the contract, he shall be entitled where the giving of such notice was prevented by the war to recover the unpaid premiums with interest at 5 per cent, per annum from the insured.[27041 E
