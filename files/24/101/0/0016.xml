COMilitary Secret. 1330From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, &apos;    &apos;    16th March 1920.(Received 18th.)3151.   16th March.   Malleson wires 10th March : -&quot;Secret.   1. My Russian secret agents&apos; reports.   Employed throughout 1919 in-Foreign Affairs Department, Tashkencl.    Got transfer to National Industries, Askabad, and left Tashkend, 26th January .1.920, arriving at Askabad, 25th February, and arrived here 7th March.&quot; 2. Military Forces. (Corrupt group) up to the date of leaving Tashkend not more than 11,000 troops from centre had reached Tashkend. Composition about 45 per cent. Russian. There are large number of troops under orders and available in Turkestan, but almost complete absence of fuel and defective engines and rolling stock has impeded movements. For same reason, ammunition and all other military supplies are very scant. in Turkestan, though immense amounts captured from Koltchak are available when railway can carry them. Confirms all previous reports regarding desperate shifts employed for railway fuel such as burning of all spare sleepers and those from sidings.&quot; 3. Bolshevik Policy. Strictly controlled from Moscow, but local leaders especially Broido are anxious to attack Persia. They consider unresponsive nature of Western democrats compel Bolsheviks to look to East. China is regarded as not yet ripe for exploitation, Afghanistan is suspected of treachery and inclinations towards England, Persia is regarded as most promising soil owing to existence of organised democratic party, corruption and misgovernment of rulers, and its delightful position in Middle East. Bolshevik leaders are buoyed up by very misleading reports from Sineki and others regarding true position in Persia. Bolshevik military authorities support Broido in designs against Persia, as they say that now Krasnovod.sk is taken, troops will deteriorate or perhaps become dangerous unless employed on active service.&quot; 4. Afghans. Informant was, attached to Afghan Mission when it first came to Tashkencl. Says VVali Mohamed is incompetent and possesses no influence. Aslam Khan is very popular with Bolsheviks and Mohamedans in Tashkend. He is incapable of any work, and spends his time in shooting and pleasure. lie is rabid Anglophobe. Broido distrusts Afghans intensely and is averse to any relations with them. He is very rude to them and keeps them waiting long time for interviews. Afghans are losing ground fast with Bolshevik authorities chiefly because of increasing rumours regarding their treachery and pan-Islam intrigues. Faiz Mohamed is secretary to Aslam Khan and does all the work. He is Anglophile and anti-Bolshevik. The Indian revolutionaries in Tashkend are regarded as of no account and are treated accordingly. They are regarded as having no desire for ideal world (? revolution) on communistic lines, but as.cherishing purely selfish notions of setting up Indian autonomy on capitalistic lines.&quot;5. Bolsheviks are very nervous regarding Mohamedan situation. They know&apos;&quot; there are few, if any, genuine Mohamedan Communists. They are convinced that everywhere British agents are secretly preparing widespread rising of all Central Asian Mohamedans against them, and they believe Afghans from Herat and Khorasan are similarly engaged. They believe both Khiva and Bokhara have all along acted under British control, and that the whole Turcoman people look to British as ultimate deliverers. Consequently they institute vigorous and increasing hunts for British agents and arrest large numbers of people, but have captured no .proofs to date. They also greatly fear possibility of English military action against Transcaspia. &apos; Troops are seized with panic at this possibility, and Broido himself is as scared as: anyone in this connection.&apos; So long as English are in Khorasan they consider whole of Turkestan position dangerous for them, and this is governing motive for action against Persia.&quot; G. Sineki, the Persian Consul, is regarded as a weak fool by Bolsheviks. He was practically compelled to sign grovelling telegrams to Lenin. On return journey from south-west, to Bolsheviks&apos; annoyance, he managed to interview Amir of Bokhara. Consequently they insisted on thorough search of his person and effects notwith-standiug his protests.&quot; 7. Kazim Beg is regarded by Bolsheviks as useful for propaganda of an Anglo-phobe character amongst the Mohamedans. Bolsheviks finance him on generous scale. Kazim Beg poses for the present as revolutionary, and avoids too much stress on Pan-Islamism, which is repugnant to his employers.&quot;
