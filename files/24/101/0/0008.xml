:cret.iCOPY NO.     gOP.908. C A B I N E T.ROYAL ARSENAL, WOOLWICH.Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works, covering the conclusions of a Conference held in his Room at the House of Commons, on the 17th of March, 1920.Having presided at the Conference which. I convened In accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet to discuss the question of Woolwich Arsenal, and having heard the various arguments and the different points of view I would like to state shortly the conclusions I have arrived at.The fundamental points seem to me to be whether Woolwich Arsenal is to be considered in the first instance as a factory primarily for the production of munitions of war, and the place where the military authorities can conduct experimental work and that civilian work shall be considered as of secondary importance, or, in the second instance, whether Woolwjch Arsenal is to be a factory for general G-overnment purposes, as well as for purposes outside the Government and for the manufacture of armaments.If the first proposition is accepted, I think the clain1 of the War Office to control Woolwich Arsenal is irresistible, even although it is likely that the efficiency of the. factory from the point of view of civilian production may suffer.If the second proposition is accepted, then the ) argument is very strongly in favour of handing ove** thecontrol of the Arsenal to a Civilian Department, and I would submit that the proper Civilian Department would be the Office of Works which, with its organisation and staff is best able to take the responsibilities of this and the other factories.
Whichever Department takes control, it is odious that the same procedure would largely have to be followed, namely, that a Board would have to be formed which should consist of representatives of the fighting services, together with a business element, also a first-class Manager would have to be appointed in either case, and I think it is quite clear to all who know anything about the Arsenal that in order to produce economically and efficiently, flfery radical remodelling of exist ng arrangements of plant and machinery would have to take place.(Sgd)   ALFRED MOND.h\ Mo Office of Works,19th March,, 1920.
Present.The Rt.Hon. Sir Alfred Mond (in the Chair).Mr, Kellaway; representing the Ministry of Munitions. Lord Lytton and Captain Aubrey Herbert representing theAdmiraJ Ly.* Sir J.E. Masterton-Bmith, representing the War Office. Sir G.L. Barstovj; representing the Treasury and a representative from Woolwich Arsenal.In accordance with the instructions of the Conference of Ministers held on the 16th instant, the First Commissioner of Works called a Conference of representatives of the three Service Departments, the Ministry of Munitions and the Treasury, with a view to formulating a scheme for the future management of Woolifciah Arsenal, on the assumption that a Ministry of Supply would not necessarily be created.   The First Commissioner outlined the general situation with regard to Woolwich Arsenal and referred to the reports and the proposals already made for its future.   The conclusion was arrived at with the approval of the representatives of the Admiralty, War Office and the Treasury, that the best policy would be that the control of the Arsenal should be re-transferred to the Secretary of State for War&apos;, it being felt that the function of the Arsenal is primarily to provide for Military and Naval needs.   The representative of the War Office pointed out very strongly that during the next few years, considerable experimental and research work would have to be done by the Army, and that Woolwich Arsenal was the best place where work of this character could be carried out. The War Office attach great importance to this aspect of the case.   He further stated that it was intended that in case the Arsenal is returned to the War Office to reorganiseROYAL ARSENAL, WOOLWICH.Conclusions of a Conference held in the First Commissioner^ Room House of Commons, on the 17th March, 1920.
it on civil lines with a first-class civilian manager to be paid a salary adequate to the importance of the work, and to appoint with him an Advisory Board of Military and Naval experts as well as representatives of great business firms.It was agreed by the representatives of the War Office and the Admiralty that there would be no difficulty in arranging the administrative details between these two   v. Departments to. ensure general co-operation sc far as questions of wages and other administrative details were concerned. The representative of the War Office stated that the War Office would undertake responsibility of the Arsenal In such a manner as to conform with the Governments promises, and to undertake such work of a civilian character as was requisite for this purpose.The representative of the Treasury agreed that the proposal was the best policy to pursue, and emphasised the importance of the Department showing its detailed expenditure on its own Votes and Estimates in the interests of economy.Mr. Kellaway dissented from this general 3onclusion and strongly expressed the opinion that Woolwich Atsenal should not revert to the control of the Fighting Services but should be placed in the charge of a Civil Ministry.   On the assumption that a Ministry of Supply was not to be created he suggested in this instance the Office of Works or Ministry of Transport.   Mr, ftellaway held the view that the civil work of the Arsenal could not and would not be carried out econom-ically if the Arsenal was in charge of the War Office.   He also expressed the opinion that the House of Commons would feel more confidence in the management of the Arsenal if it were under non-military control.
Mr. Kellaway said the Cabinet desired Woolwich Arsenal to be treated as a test ca     of what should be the future of all National Factories.The Conference unanimously agreed that the Departmenttaking over Woolwich Arsenal should also ta&apos;ke over theother national Factories which the Government had decided to retain.
