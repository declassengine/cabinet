This document is the property ot His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.(iTHE CABINET.INTERIM REPORT OP DISABILITY PENSIONS COMMITTEE.MEMORANDUM BY THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.In the absence of the Secretary of State for War, I circulate herewith a_-Memorandum, by the Financial Secretary of the War Office, on the Interim Report of ^eD the Disability Pensions Committee.   (CP. 847.) 87PEEL.The War Office,March, 1920.The War Office agrees with the recommendations of the Committee, subject to one stipulation.The Report provides for men whose disabilities are not attributable to service (paragraph 3) and for those whose disabilities are attributable (paragraph 4), in Army and Navy alike, on a scale beginning with those of 14 years&apos; service and upwards ; but it provides, for the Navy alone, rates for men of over 10 years&apos; service.This is in harmony with the present Navy regulations, which (unlike those of the Army) provide, in certain cases, pensions beginning at LO years&apos; servioe.It is understood that the abolition of this provision is already under consideration for future entrants.Now that assimilation of detailed regulations of the two Services is being carried so far, the War Office is of opinion that, to avoid pressure for a similar concession in the Army, this special provision should be definitely confined to men already in the Navy. It is aware that &quot;service&quot; for this purpose in the Navy does not include reserve service, as it may in the Army; and would see no objection to assimilation of the Navy to the Army practice in this particular.Archibald Williamson.(B20/153)   100  3/20  H&amp;S  8079wo
