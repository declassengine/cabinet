Kammerer.ITALY.Colonel Castoldi.JAPAN.i, Yoshida, C.B.The Committee unanimously recommend the attached draft articles for insertion in the treaty of peace with JCurkey.   The articles take account of certain proposals on this matter put forward by M. Venizelos.   At the same time the Committee wish to make the following observations:The Turkish Government have more than once in history solemnly pledged themselves to carry out just the reforms which these articles embody.   The Imperial Hatti Sherif of Gulhane, November 3rd, 1839, the Imperial Hatti Humayoun of February 18th 1856, and the Treaty of Berlin 1878 may be cited.All of these promises have remained dead letters and\it seems too optimistic to expect that the present pledges
-   128will be carried out unless the Allies can obtain by the Treaty real guarantees.   The presence of Allied ships and troops near the capital may be an adequate guarantee so far as the Government and the country near the capital are concerned but the experience of the armistice and especially the recent Armenian massacres clearly show that some further guarantee is required for the effective performance in the interior of paper pledges signed by the Government at Constantinople.The Committee feel it their duty to say that in their opinion the following, further guarantees -are required,(1)   Foreign officers to be named by the Allied and Associated Powers should be present in the Turkish gendarmerie and police to the extent of not more than 25% of the total officers of the force.   Such officers to have the same executive powers as Turkish officers.(S)     In every district the police, gendarmerie and rural and forest guards should be recruited and officered with due repard to the racial factors in the local popUla-tion.   Especially should the non-Moslems, be represented in among the highest posts.The Committee have also been tempted to suggest that /Article 13 of the draft submitted might be strengthened, W- stating that the League may consider the removal of the ^turkish Government from Constantinople as a possible,penalty jfor a breach by the Turkish Government of\their pledges under  his chapter.The Committee felt, however, precluded by the general tenor of recent discussions at the Supreme Council from actually embodying the above guarantees in the chapter but they cannot refrain from pointing out that the /lilies will lay themselves open to the reproach of being contented once ^again in spite of long experience with paper guarantees for
the protection of minorities in Turkey unless something like the above practical puarantces arc inserted in the minorities chapter or elsewhere in the Treaty,In conclusion the Committee desire to add that other minority Treaties have usually contained stipulations re gar d-ing changes of nationality rendered necessary by the creation of new States or the transfer of territory to existing States. In the case of Turkey the situation is so complex and the conditions so abnormal that the Committee - desire to recommend in due course a chapter regarding nationality, for insertion in the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, in which the necessary ; provisions will be separately elaborated,LONDON,March 9th,1920.-5-
Article 1Turkey undertakes that the stipulations contained in Articles 2, 6 and 7 of this chapter shall be recog-nised as fundamental laws, and that no civil or military laws or regulations, no Imperial Iradeh nor official action shall conflict or interfere with these stipulations, nor shall any law, regulation or official action prevail over them.Article 2.Turkey undertakes to assure full and complete protection of life and liberty to all inhabitants of Turkey without distinction of birth, nationality, language, race or religion.All inhabitants of Turkey shall be entitled to the free exercise, whether public or private, of any oreed, religion or belief.Article 3,- Whereas from the 1st November, 1914, until the dateof the coming into force of the present Treaty there was aterrorist regime in the Ottoman Empire and whereas noconversions to Islam could therefore take place under normalconditions, no conversions between those dates are recognised and all who were non-Moslems before November 1st, 1914 areto be considered as such today unless, after regaining theirliberty, they voluntarily perform the necessary formalitiesfor embracing the Islamic faith.The Turkish Government will lend every assistance forthe recovery of men, women and children of wholly or partlynon-Moslem parentage who have adopted the Islamic faith since november 1st, 1914, and who are officially claimed by their , orfamilies/in the default of their families by their community. It will also concede the fullest right of search for lost persons in private houses and institutions, the search to be carried out by a representative of the community affected and
and an official of the Turkish Government, together with such other foreign representative as may thereafter be determined by the Allies.&apos;Article 4*Turkey undertakes to reoognise such provisions as the Allied Powers may consider opportune with respect to the reciprocal and voluntary emigration of persons belonging to racial minorities.In particular Turkey undertakes to adhere to the Treaty between Greece and Bulgaria relating to reciprocal emigration, signed at Neuilly-sur-Seine on November 27th, 1919, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the Said Treaty.Article 5.The Turkish Government recognises the inequitable character of the Law on Abandoned Properties (Smval-i-Metroukeh) 1915 and of the supplementary provisions thereof and declares them to be null and void, in the past as in the future.It solemnly undertakes to facilitate to the greatest possible extent the return to their homes and re-establish-ment in their businesses of the Turkish subjects of non-Turkish race who have been forcibly driven from their homes by fear of massacre or any other form of pressure, since 1st August, 1914.   It recognises that any real or movable property of the said Turkish subjects of non-Turkish race or of the communities to which such subjects belong, which can be recovered, must be restored to them as soon as possi-ble, in whatever hands it may be found, free of all charges and servitude, with which they may have been bur-dene d and without any compensation of any sort to the presentowners
owners or actual holders of ouch property, subjeot to any action such owners or holders may bring against the person from whom they acquired the rights in question.The Turkish Government further agrees that the funds which may be applied by the Financial Commission for the benefit of such Turkish subjects of non-Turkish race or of their communities (in virtue of Article 5 of the (Finanoial Clauses) shall be allocated in accordance with the provisions of the present article.The Turkish Government agrees that arbitral commissions shall be appointed, by the Council of the League of Nations wherever found necessary.  - Those commissions shall each be co mposed of one representative of the Turkish Govern-ment, one representative of the injured community or whose member nay have been injured,, and a chairman appointed by the Council of the League of Nations.     The arbitral Commissions shall hoar all claims falling within the scope of this article and decide them by summary procedure.The arbitral Commissions will have the power to . decide:    (a) The provision by the Turkish Government oil&apos; labour for any work of reconstruction or restoration deemed necessary.     This labour shall be recruited from the races inhabiting the territory where the Arbitral Commission considers the execution of the said works to be necessary;   (b) the removal of any person, who, ait-.,&apos; enquiry, shall be recognised as having taken an active part in massacres or deportations or who may have provoked them, the measures to be taken with regard to his possessions being indicatel by the Commission;    (c) the disposal of property belonging to members of a community who have died or disappeared since August 1st, 1914, without leaving heirs,with/ - 8 -
with the power to hand over their goods and property to the community instead of to the State;    fd) the cancellation of all acts of sale or any acts creating rights over real property concluded after the 1st August, 1914.     The indemnification of the possessors will he a charge upon the Turkish Government, hut must nevertheless not serve as a pretext for delaying restitution.     The Commission will however have the power to impose equitable arrangements among the interested parties, if any, which may have been patld by the present owner of such property.The Turkish Government undertakes to facilitate in the fullest possible measure,the work of the Commissions and to ensure the execution of their decisions, which will be final.
