COTTKOIXi.9 &apos;COlDTi-tJliXIALa t no THE. CLAIMS OF POTOS , .COPY OF MEMORANDUM TO MR * LLOYD GEORGE SIGNED BY THE&quot;&quot;&quot; MuTTO^O-OF^^Claridge&apos;s Hotel, W,l.March 10th.1920.Right Honourable Sir,We are informed that the Armenian question has been settled without any reference to the question of Pontus. We feel it therefore to be our imperative duty yet once more to lay before you the claims of Pontus and of the Greek populations which it comprises from Sinope to Rizeh.The territory in question embracing the vilayet of Trebizsnd (exclusive of the sandjak cf Lazistan which has an almost purely Moslem population); and the sandjaks of Sam-sun, Shabbin-Karahissar, Amasia and Sinope, has an area of some 50,000 square kilometers0Colonized by Greeks as far back as the 7th century B.C. it has formed a part of the Greek world throughout the twenty six ensuing centuries.   On the Latin Conquest of Constantinople in 1204 it formed the Comnenian Empire of TreftLzond which only capitulated to the Turks eight years after the Fall of Constantinople (1461).The population&quot; of Pontus Is approximately-1,700,000* Of these 850,000 are Greeks including a quarter of a mil-lion emigrants in Southern Russia and Caucasia who await the liberation of Pontus to return to their homes.   The re-ma Inder are grouped in statistics as &quot;Turks&quot; but are in re-ality Moslems of different races.   Special mention may be
iiiado of some 250,000 among them in\,he districts of Off and Tonia whc are of pure Greek extraction, descendants cf Christ-ians forcibly Islandzed 180 years back.   These populations have retained their Greek speech and many of their traditions.The Greek element is- the pivot of such intellectual and economic life as the country possesses.   Recognizing this fact the. Young Turkish Government attempted to alter the ethnolo-strategic&amp;j. complexion cf Pcntus by a systematic persecution of the Greeks, intensified during tho 17ar.   As a result of these per-secutvlons 150,000 Greeks have been deported from their homes cr compelled to take refuge In Russia during the past five years,In the course of the War certain events of considerable political significance occurred in Pontus.   The Russian Array occupied Trebizond on April 18, 1916.   On the eve of the Turkish evacuation of the city the Vali handed over the administration to a Provisional Greek Government headed by the Metropolitan with the words &quot;Prom you vie took this country and to you xve restore it,&quot;   This local Greek body retained the civil Government in Its hands for nearly two years.   It set up mixed tribunals, organized a gendarmerie recruited from both races and collected taxes.   It was recognized by the Russian authorities and the Turkish population as also by the local representatives of the Allied Powers and the United States. Proof of this Is furnished by the documents reproduced in the enclosed memorandum.The provisional Greek Government was successful in main-taining law and order throughout this troubled period.   The pamphlet enclosed reproduces letters of the mufti of Trebi-zond and of Volrib Pasha commanding the third Turkish Army which addressing the Metropolitan recognize that &quot;Prom the en-&quot;trance of the enemy into Trebizond to the present day you have &quot; succeeded in administering the country with tact and wisdom
hi I *J&quot;to you cur sincere admiration and warmgratitude.&quot;The aspiration of pontus to-day is to secure its full in-dependenco.     The compact masses of Its Greek-population are tho &quot;basis of this aspiration,     If, however, more general oonsldoera--tiens make this solution Impossible wo venture to submit that it is not tea much to ask for an autonomous regime analogous to that which formerly worked so successfully in the Lebanon, with an European governor,local self-government and a local gendarmerie under European organizers.     Suoh a regime could alone secure to the Gieeks-of Pontus the elementary oondi-tions of a deoent human existence.     Further such a regime would alone make possible the repatriation of the Pontus Greeksscattered over Southern Russia and Caucasia and totalling wall over 200,000, including some 60,000 who fled from the country under stress of persecution during the War.A &quot;bitter experience&apos; of five centuries has convinced us of the worthiessness in Turkey of paper reforms and paper guarantees. European pressure on the Sublime Porte is of. little avail to protect the far-away Greek population of Pontus who have corn-promised themselves in Turkish eyes by the assistance given by them to the Allies in their attempt to reconstitute the Cau-casian front on the collapse of Russia (in 1918) and by their subsequent demand for autonomy.   We will mention only one fact which gives an idea of the confidence to be placed in Turkish good faith.   Towards the beginning of 1918 the Turkish Army advanced to re-occupy the Trebizond district.   Irregular bands accompanying the Army and organized under official auspices were given a free hand in burning and pillaging Christian villages at the very moment that General Vehib Pasha with tra-strategic irony was writing to the Provisional Greek Government and thanking it for &quot;the noble and paternal protection extended &apos;by it to the Moslem element.&quot;  &quot;When the General entered Trebi--o-a^aaaad a.        .-aav
zond he looked at the desolation which reigned in the country around and he acquiesced in the accomplished facts.Similar crimes are still being committed in Pontus in spite of the Armistice and they will continue to be committed unless the Peace Conference takes steps to remove this &apos; distracted country from Turkish administration.   The concess-&apos; ion of self-government on the other hand will bring with it the happy results exemplified by the case of the Lebanon,-securing the Christian populations in their rights and allow-ing the two races to live peacefully side by side,We beg to remain/ Sir,with the highest consideration. Signed: Chrysanthos, the archbishcp of Trebizond.Signed: Constantine-Jason G,Constantinides,President of the Pan-Pontic Congress *Signed: Socrates OEconomos,President of the National League of the Euxine Pontus at Paris *TO the Right Honourable David LLOYD GEORGE, M.P., ,        Prime Minister of Great Britain and Ireland, President of the .Peace Conference, 10, Downing Street, LONDON.
