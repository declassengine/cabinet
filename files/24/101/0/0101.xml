Millie TRY OF TRANSPORT.Memorandum for the O^ab inet hy the liini^ste^r of Transport.1.   I forward this Memorandum for the purpose of direct-ing the attention of the Cabinet to the situation regarding the conveyance of traffic by coastwise vessels.2.   Under the Coastwise Subsidies scheme which the Cabinet approved at the instance of the President of theBoard of Trade, and which came into operation on the l8tli-August, 191? and is still in force, goods imported foreign, or intended for export foreign, are conveyed by coastwise vessels at the corresponding railway rates, the difference between such rates and the actual freight charges but not including Insurance or Demurrage being refunded by the Government to the trader.   During the seven months ended February 1920, the tonnage carried coastwise under this arrangement was 904,721, and the average cost of the subsidy on the percentage of claims paid has been about 15/- per ton,3.   The cost of this subsidy is on Cabinet instruction bein^ borne by the Ministry of Transport on a special vote, and I think fiat this procedure is quite wrong for the following amongst other reasons:-(a)   The Minister 01 Transport has no &apos; powers whatever over coastal shipping as he is &apos; not in control of the ships or of Cocks except in a few cases of railway owned dooks.   It will be realised moreover that a considerable portion of the coastal shipping business is conducted in connection with allocated berths at docks and at private wharves.
-8 - 450The whole of the arrangements as regards allocation of Shipping for the coastal service are in the hands of the Shipping Controller..    He alone can take the steps which are necessary to secure the adequacy of this service and that the shipping facil--ities he provides are utilised to the best advantage.     In order to secure this result and to avoid unreasonable delay In the turning round of vessels engaged in the coastal shipping industry, it is of course essential that very businesslike arrangements should be made with the Dock Authorities for the reception .of ships, with the Stevedores for the unloading of cargoes, and with the Consignees and Consignors of the goods for the effective clearance of the quays.     It has become a habit in Parliament to blame the Ministry of Transport for the congestion of the Docks, but I cannot point out too strongly that in the absence of most business-like arrangements on the lines I have indicated, no adequate advantage from the revival of the Coast Shipping Service can be secured, the docks are bound to become congested and both the Ministry of Transport and the Railway Companies are powerless to prevent such a state of things.     I entirely disclaim all responsi-bility for this state of affairs which I most strongly deprecate.No reports are available indicating the number of ships now engaged In the Conatal Service as compare4 with the year.1913. but tho not register tonnage of vessels arriving and
odeparting coastwise with cargo vas 42 per cent less in 1919  &quot;than In 1913, and the railways are T oelie-ve   leering more tonnage from the ports than they did in the highest year on record, 1913. (b)      The real financial check upon claims under the I present form of subsidy is exercised by the Shipping Controller through the machinery of his Home Trade Transport Committee Committees are not answerable to the Ministry of Transport, which thus has absolutely no voice in the amount to be paid by way of subsidy, and has no alternative but to pay on the certifi-cates of the Committees. 4.   I think it must be obvious from these reasons that responsibility for the coastwise subsidy is not one which properly falls to be borne on a Ministry of Transport vote,and that this responsibility fhouid be transferred to the Minister upon -wiri6m.it really rests, namely the Shipping Controller.     I can not too strongly emphasise that Railways are carrying more than their pre-war burden - coastal shipping is not meeting it by a ft very considerable amount.5.   As regards what is to be done in the future, it will be remembered that provision for the payment of the. subsidy has only been made up to the 31st instant.     Although the present form of subsidy is open to greatest objection In that&apos;there is no incentive to Ship Owners to reduce freights or to Dock Authorities and ethers to reduce handling costs in order to retain traffic, I agree with the Shipping Controller and the Port and Transit Executive Committee that pending the completion of other arrangements the present form of subsidy should be continued and I agree that it should be borne for four weeks from March 31st upon the Ministry cf Transport Coastwise Subsidy vote. This can be arranged for the reason that owing to the necessity for close local scrutiny,
claims have been presented for only a small percentage of the total&apos;tonnage carried and under these circumstances it has been necessary for me to provide in my estimates for 1920 - 21 a sum of  980,000 for the coastal subsidy as a re-vote.   As &quot;the average cost per ton works cut at a lower rate than was contemplated due to the increase in railway rates, there will be a margin on which the scheme can be carried on for the short period which I have suggested.6.     As regards arrangements to be made after the end of that period there is no doubt that the failure to attract shipping tonnage to coastwise trades is attributable to tho high freights which can be obtained elsewhere, and I suspect there is &quot;profiteering&quot; in the ship-owning business which I am powerless to influence0   This is at the roct of the trouble and in my view the real remedy is to give any necessary direct subsidy to coastwise shipping ins Lead of to the traffic conveyed.   The object to be aimed at is to secure that traffic should be conveyed by coastal service In volume corresponding with that which was so carried in pre-war dpys, and the problem is to achieve this resulte The present situation does not admit of the matter being*allowed to wait until such time ?.s economic factors begin to operate in the right direction, and some form of subsidy, however undesirable In principle, seems&apos;&quot;to be essential. Since the inauguration of the present scheme of subsidy there has been a large general increase in railway rates, for the purpose of placing them on to an economic basis, but in spite of this the charges obtaining by coastal services are still materially higher than the corresponding railway charges, and I understand that coastal freights have actually risen by about 20 per cent on an average since the increase in railway ratesc   The result is that the coastal service is not pulling its load, and the Railway Companies
A   0t-5-are being compelled to deal with a large volume of traffic which they are not laid out or equipped to deal with, and an undue demand has been made on the already hard pressed rolling stock.7.     I trust that the Cabinet will take this question Into their consideration at an early dote, it being one of great urgency, and that they will deal with it on the lines I suggest.   Its solution will have a powerful effect upon the recovery of trade in the country,(Signed) ERIC GEDDES*Slat March 1920.
