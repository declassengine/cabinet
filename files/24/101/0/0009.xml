The Cabinet.THE FUTURE OF WOOLWICH ARSENAL,It&quot;&apos; Iffi^Ri^DIM BY THE DEPUTY JMISTEE JSLiBffiSfflg&apos;the Conference appointed to.consider the future of Woolwioh Arsenal, on tho assumption that a Ministry of Supply is not created.    The Conference reported in favour of handing back Woolwich Arsenal to tho control of tho War Office,my dissent should be recorded.  The decision which the Cabinet has to take is so important that I dosiro to put before them the reasons why I think it undesirable to return to tho pre-war state of affairs and plaoe the Arsenal under the War Office,the Admiralty, and the Ministry of Monitions e&amp;oh oon-trols a Section of the Arsenal,    The Admiralty has 1,500-  omployoes, the War Office 7,500, and the Ministry of Munitions 16,500.    The Ministry^ figure of 16,500 compares with a total of, 80,000 employees at tho moment of greatest pressure during the War.now administered by the Ministry of Munitions, and which it is proposed should be handed back to tho War Office, we havo to consider what number of employees would bo necessary to retain the Arsenal as a unit capable of expansion to meet military needs in an emergency.I dissented from this view and desired thatThe present position is that the War Office^Dealing only with that portion of the Arsenal
This figure has been estimated at 10,000 persons.   The pre-war strength was about 12,000 persons.   The War Offioe requirements for War Material will not provide employment for anything like thi3 number,   A3 the Secretary of State for War said, the fighting forces have such large reserves that they will for some years be living on their tails. The War Office requirements, as expressed in thuir Estimates for the coming year, would not,, it is calculated, employ more than 2,000 persons. ; X  it is accepted that the employees at the   Arsenal cannot be reduced below a permanent strength of 10,000, the Government is faced with the problem of finding alternative work for.at least 8,000 persons.   This involves the. production for.Government Departments of a very, large amount of, work of a civil character, such as railway, locomotives, wagons, repairs to wagons and motor transport vehicles material for the Post Office and the Mint, and possibly work in connection with the. Government Housing, Programme.The cabinet has, on.more than one occasion, considered the. question of finding work other than munitions work for the Arsenal, and it has approved of such work being placed there. ;. In compliance, with this decision the Ministry of Munitions has obtained from other Government Departments orders for considerable amounts of alternative work^ and negotiations are now being conduoted for increas-ing the volume of work, of this character.It is important, in this connection to recall that the Prime Minister and the.Leader of.the House at meetings with deputations af workmen from the Arsenal, have undertaken thatalvil work for Government Departments shall be provided for the.Arsenal. It is clear that unless discharges on a wholesale scale are to take place at the/Ars enal
Arsenal, this undertaking must be carried out. The present personnel at Woolwich consists almost entirely of ex-sorvioo men and pro-war employees.   It may be neoeBsary in the national interest to   get rid of very large numbers of these ex-service mon and pre-war employees, but it certainly cannot be done without causing serious Indus-trial trouble- in London, embittered, as it would be, by the conviction in the minds of the men that the Government had not kept faith with them.It must also be borne in mind that the annual cost of maintenance and upkeep of the National Factories reserved for use in the event of another great war will be heavy and in order to relieve this dead weight every effort will have to be made to provide alternative civil work consistent with the object with which the Faotorios are retained.   Only a Department whose attention is constantly and mainly directed to the problems involved could efficiently discharge the duty.It would further bo essential to consider closely the plant and lay-out of the Factories (which at present arc suoh as to make enonomi^ production almost impossible), so as to enable them to undertake efficiently such civil work as would bs possible and appropriate.   This function alone would make enormous demands upon, the time and thoughts o  the AiminIstaring Authority.At the inter-departmentel conference the representa-tire of the War Office stated that tho War Office saw no difficulty in carrying out the civil wort for other Government Departments necessary to give effect to the -Gotemment &quot;a under&apos;- , takings.   I am, however, of  opinion that however qualified the War Office may be to -deal with the experiment and research side ef munitions production, it is not qualified to deal suecessfully with eivil work.   If work&apos;of tho kind new being d&amp;no at tfe Arsenal is to be anything  /
but a disguised form of charity and labour, it must produce on terms at least as good as these for which the Government can obtain similar goods from private contractors. A military Department is not, I submit, equipped,so as to be capable of doing this.With the War Office in control of. the Arsenal military ideas would, of necessity, dominate polioyand administration.,     It is true that the Representative of the War Office stated that his Dept would adopt the recommendations of the MoKinnon Wood,Committee, which Mr.Churchill set up when he was Minister of munitions and which has been approved by the Arsenal Adviisory Committee set up by lord Inverforth, but.the civilian to be pL?.oed inKadministrative control of the Arsenal.under this scheme, and the Board of.Military, Naval, and Commercial experts, which it is proposed should advise him, would be responsible to and would be controlled by the Army Council and the Secretary of State for War..In these circumstances, it.is incredible that the civil work, which on the assumptions I have made, and, which so far as I am aware, are. not disputed, must for. a considerable time represent by far the largest part of Arsenal production, would have a, fair chance of being carried, on on strictly commercial lines.&quot;During the years before the war,, when the Arsenal was under, military control, it became a by-nword amongst engineers, for inefficiency, confusion, obsolete methods and a layout which made economic production impossible.. For forty years, the reports of various Committees have afforded conclusive, evidence of the failure of the fighting Departments effectively to control or administer Woolwich./Lord,
Lord Morley!s Committee reported in 1887 asfollows:-&quot;7*......The five Departments are entirely independent of one another, eaoh of them having a distinct organisation complete, in itself under a Superintendent, with separate accounts, separate storesj and separate clerical, inspect-ingj and manufacturing staffs,   Their oommon subordina-tion to the Directors of Artillery and Store, constitutes the only link of connection between them.&quot;Sir William Anderson, in 1898 found no improve-ment.In 1909, General Hadden (then M.G.O.), made thefoilov;ing repor t: -&quot;Hie Committee have asked the Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories to submit proposals for reducing &quot;the cost of manufeoture in the Ordnance Factories, and he has been unable to offer any practical suggestions,&quot;In 191C, Mr. Alexander Gracie of the Fairfield  .Shipbuilding Company, in a report to the Committee on thecost of Ordnance Factories1 Production, said:-ff......,Further, the elaborate system upon whichthe whole establishment is worked - the expense of whioh goes to on cost - has the effect of an exception-ally high cost result as compared with what would be the case in a well equipped establishment competing for trade,&quot;These conditions continued without effective improvement up to the time when war broke out.   It was impossible during the war, to make any far-reaching changes, Effort bad to be concentrated on the increase of production, but the McEinnon Wood; Committee, appointed by Mr, Churchill when Minister of Munitions, strongly condemned the method of administration which the Ministry of Munitions had inherited from the War Office.Lord Inverforth&apos;S Advisor;?&quot; Committee accepted the recommendations of the McKinnon Wood Committee, and put forward to the Cabinet proposals for. the proper con-duct and organisation of the Arsenal,   The Cabinet on May 6th 1919, accepted the prinoiple that the Arsenal should be responsible to one Minister, and that that Minister should be the Minister of Supply.
The Cabinet is now asked by the War Office to reverse its decision and to hand &quot;back the control of the Arsenal to the Military Authorities.   If the Cabinet is not prepared in existing circumstances, to agree to the creation of a Ministry of Supply, I submit that the worst possible solution of the problem of Woolwich would be to put it once more under the control of the War Office.It is not only the future of Woolwich Arsenal which is involved.   ThQ Department responsible for the Arsenal must also be responsible for the other National Factories -The Royal Small Arms Factory, Bnfield.Gretna - Propellants.Queensferry - T*NYT.Banbury - Picric and Scheelite.Perivale - Fuse Filling.Hereford - Filling.Sutton Oak - Poison G&amp;-3.The National Anti-Gas, Y/atford,Swindon -Armnonium Nitrate.The same considerations apply to these Factories. If they are to be retained as an effective, unit, capable of expansion in an emergency, and are not to be a dead * weight charge on the Exchequer, a oertain amount of civil work must be carried on in them, and is at present being carried on at Gretna and Queensferry.I would therefore strongly urge upon the Cabinet the following conclusions.(1)   The whole of the Arsenal to be under one Minister and in the control of one Chief Superintendent who must be a civilian as recommended by the McSinnon Wood Committee. (H)   This one Minister to be the head of a Civil Depart-ment of the State.
(3)   Whatever decision may be taken as to the future Ministerial position of the Arsenal, authority to be given at once for the appointment of a Civil Superintendent of the Arsenal and an expert Advis-ory Committee on which the Military Departments would be represented, and for proceeding at   once with the remodelling of the Ordnance Factories so as to enable them to undertake civil work eff-iciently and economically,($get)     F. Oil AWAY.19th March, 1920.E.S.      Since writing the above Memorandum I have seen Sir Alfred Mond1s note which accompanies thereport of the Conference,1   The only observation I wouldmake is that there is no &quot;thing inconsistent in the proposition that the Arsenal should be under the controlof a civilian Ministry with the, provision of adequate facilities for the conduct of military and naval expert- .mental work.   It has been already accepted that WoolwichArsenal should be organised mainly as a peace establishmentfor the supply of armaments in p&amp;ace time and of experi-mental type and improved design %n war and peace, and shouldalso have a certain reserve&quot; of expansion for a small far;&quot;&quot;intendedThe provision of alternative work is/primarily as a. means of maintaining the efficiency of the Arsenal for military purposes and not necessarily as an end in itself.19/3/20,
