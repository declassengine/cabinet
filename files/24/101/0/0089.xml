From Viceroy, Army Department) to Secretary of Stale for India,25th March 1920.(Received 26th.)3860. In reply to Sir P. Cox&apos;s request for an unofficial appreciation of the Bolshevik intentions against Persia, Malleson wires, 13th March : -&quot; 1. All reports from Persian sources I suggest should be treated with, greatest reserve, as it is very necessary. Persian officials here have twice recently started groundless scares of Bolshevik invasions.&quot; 2. All the Bolshevik threats and schemes against Persia, I report briefly as my duty compels, but I have repeatedly expressed my opinion that these demonstrations should not be treated too seriously.&quot; 3. Most of the Bolshevik wrath against Persia and the British, I have reason to believe, was the work of lire-brand Broido, who for last few months has been all-powerful in Turkestan. Under orders from Moscow he has now been removed as dangerous. It was certainly Tashkend rather than Moscow which inspired all these threats.   We may now hear less of them.&quot; 4. The Bolshevik movement via Gumbad-i-Kabuz through Sabzawar, and so eastwards to the Afghan frontier, I regard as highly improbable and even fantastic. It is apparently based on no better authority than that of a spy, who seems anything but reliable, and the Prime Minister might be told that it is unlikely military operation.&quot; 5. In my opinion the Bolsheviks are far more frightened of us than we are of them. They exaggerate our numbers, and are half convinced that we are about to attack them, which attack will be the signal for an uprising of all Mohamedans of Central Asia, aided by the Afghans, against them. In the Kushk area, they believe on our instigation the Afghans are about to attack them, and that British detachments have gone to the assistance of the Afghans on that frontier.&quot; 6. It is always possible, of course, that isolated frontier incidents may occur, but my present information does not in the least support any notion that the Bolshevik policy, as countenanced by Moscow, involves any formal invasion of Persia by their forces.&quot; 7. I think that the other scheme, which I have frequently reported, whereby Persians armed, trained, and instructed in revolutionary agitation by the Bolsheviks are to be let loose in Persia, on the other hand seems much more probable. With regard to this I have urged on the Governor General, for months past, the importance of taking all necessary precautions to deal with agitators and spys, who would, precede a more formidable incursion. I am still not sure that everything possible in this direction has been done.&quot; 8. Owing to food scarcity which is rapidly increasing throughout Turkestan, it is probable that Bolsheviks may have to turn to Persia for supplies, especially if they cannot gain command of the Caspian Sea. This is a political question of the enemy, but if Allies are re-opening trade with Russia, Persia can presumably follow suit, always bearing in mind that payment in Russian paper is to be absolutely refused.&quot; 9. I am hardly in a position to make suggestions with regard to Astarabad area, but I would point out that if we and Persia tolerate premeditated existence in that area of any sort of &quot; white &quot; enclave, we thereby give the Bolshevik an excuse for violent, measures. At present this area, including Ashurada, is a sort of &quot; white &quot; base against the Bolshevik. Is it not time to tell all denominations of Russians that they cannot come south of international boundary, viz., Atrak River?&quot;
