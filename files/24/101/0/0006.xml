1     i&apos;/&apos;/ i,,:  .-.24fx,   // v7*2(ffila document isjjhg^-gxojerby of Hie Britannio , .   Majesty*s Government )*CABINET, UlfEAglOYKMT INSURANCE BILL. Memorandum by the Minister o&apos;f Labour.4Two points of outstanding importance have arisen &apos; in connection with this Bill whioh is now In Committee, and it is necessary to oome to a decision immediately with regard to them.Application of the Bill, to. Ireland.In Great Britain the Bill applies to substantially the whole employed population with the exception of persons employed in agriculture and domestic services    In Ireland the, application of the Bill is limited to the trades already insured against unemployment under the Rational Insurance (Unemployment) Acts, 1911 to 1919 - i*e* to Building, ^ngineeav ing and Shipbuilding and to certain trades which 0.me within the category of munitions making Establishments during the War. jThe reason for not applying to Ireland the- extended provisions of the new Bill was partly that, in view of the proposed establishment of Irish Legislatures, it was not desired to alter the status quo any more than was absolutely necessary; partly that the rates of benefit proposed under the. Bill (namely 15s. for men and 12s. for women) are relatively much higher for Ireland than for Great Britain, and therefore more lively to lead to abuse in Ireland;   and   ; partly that the fact that the large proportion of the Irish population is engaged in agriculture or closely allied pursuits (which
2* l)v/ould in any event be excluded from the Bill)   seemed to make it less necessary to apply the Bill generally in Ireland.    The Bill contains a provision enabling the Minister of Labour,with the consent of the Treasury, to apply its provisions subsequently by administrative order to any of the employments which are initially excluded from its operation.In the debate on the seoond reading of the Bill there was a unanimous demand from the representatives of Irish   constituencies in the House that the benefits of the Bill should be applied in Ireland in the same manner as in Great Britain.   It was claimed that so long as there was a single Parliament for the United Kingdom Ireland was entitled to ask for and to receive the same treatment in a matter of this sort as that accorded to Great Britai n*i    i-is an answer to the argument that it would be better to leave this matter to be settled by the proposed Irish Legislatures.    * it was urged that the Government were adopting the opposite view, in connection with the Irish education Billo    Later, one of the Ulster Unionists Members has Informed me that if we don11 apply the Bill to Ireland in the same way as in Great Britain he and his colleagues will fight every line of the Bill at every stage.    Mr. .)evlin is in the same state of mindsThe Government actually has been consulted as to the financial effect of applying the Bill to Ireland in the same manner as to Great Britain, and has advised that the additional State contribution from the Exchequer would be increased by an annual amount of from  146*000 to  171,000, and, owing to the relatively higher rate of unemployment in Ireland the estimated annual surplus of the Unemployment Fund would be reduced by about   02c000 a year, or, in certain
contingencies,. by-about.  160*000- a yean.   rjrho eatirngfted. amual* surplus of the Fund as the Bill stands. aVpreeent is  773.000 a year.   In considering the matter regard must be had to the possibility of the Agricultiiral..industry bejjig brought within the scope of the Bill at some future time,   The figure given above does not Include any provision for this contingency, I am of opinion that unless the limitations as regards Ireland are removed the Pill will encounter dangerous opposition and politically it is difficult to adduce valid arguments for retaining the Bill as it stands in the event of a united demand from the Irish representatives for the removal of these limiations.   Accordingly I submitted a proposal to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that these limitations should be removed,, but he has not been able to agree.   I hold the view that the removal of these limitations is necessary if we are to carry the Bill and I therefore ask the Cabinet for its decision.Rate of  nejiinlojyTient^Bejiefit^ in^the^ oase of women,The weekly rates of unemployment benefit proposed in the Bill are 15s for men and 12s for women, half these rates being payable to boys and girls respectively under tha age of 18. These rates are the same as those proposed in the amending Bill relating to health insurance;,The weekly rates of contribution proposed by the Unemplcy-ment Insurance Bill are 6d In respeot of men and 5c! In respect Of women (half the amount in each case being paid by the employer and half by the worker )- the retes for boys and girls under 18 being respectively 4d and&apos; 3d a weeksDuring the proceedings In Committee on Tuesday, 16th March an amendment was moved which involved indirectly a proposal that the 8erne weekly rate of benefit should be paid to women as to men.   A debate followed on the merits of this proposal
from which it was evident that the Committee were practically unanimous in favour of paying the same rete of unemployment benefit to women as to men, iae0 15/- per week and they conceded that for this purpose the women1s contribution should be raised from 2-gd per week to 3d - making the joint contribution of the employer and woman employee 6d0   The   amendment under discussion was finally withdrawn on the understanding that the substantial point was left to he decided at a later stage of the proceedings in Committee, and that meanwhile the Government would have the opportunity of deciding what course to take.It may be regarded as certain that the Committee will insist on raising the weekly rate of benefit for women as high as 15s and to any higher rate that may be decided for men,   The political pressure of the women voters is, at present, having a very potent effect on members of the House of Commons, I believe it will be difficult to resist this demand either in the Committee or the HouseaThe financial effect if the rate is 15s for both men and women, and the weekly rate of contribution for women is raised to 6d with the full State contribution of one-third of the Joint contribution, will be that the balance as between reoeipts and expenditure of the fund will be substantially unaltered, whilst the annual amount of the State contribution will be increased by about  168,000   (The increase in the State contribution would be somewhat higher than this if the limitations as regards Ireland were removed,;)   It is to be remembered that the Financial Resolution prevents the State contribution in respect cf women being raised above one-third of 5d though this could be altered by a recommittal of the Financial Resolution.My feeling on the whole is that, whilst I should greatly prefer to rets in the rate of benefit for women at 12s, I do not
think that the Bill ought to be lost on this account; and unless, therefore, there is reason to expect that the House would be willing to reverse the decision of the Committee on this point, the Government should be prepared to accept the rate of 15s, for women and to take the necessary steps in order to give effect to it*This proposal has been discussed with the Treasure^ but at the time of writing I have not been informed of the conclusion they had reached on the subject,20th March, 19203 (Signed) R.S.HQRNE.a.V
