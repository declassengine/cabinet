1 i&apos;-      &quot;     195This Document is the property of His Britannic majesty&apos;s government.SECRET*COMMERCIAL STORAGE SPACE OCCUPIED EYGOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORTl,   I have received from the Chairman of the Storage Committee (which is composed of representatives of the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Board of Trade, Ministry of Pood, Ministry of Munitions, Office of Works, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Transport and War Office) a letter urging strongly the necessity for early release for its proper commercial use, of storage accommodation belonging to Railway, Dock and Canal Undertakings, which is still occupied by Government Departmentso2*   The Committee state that in consequence of the lack of storage accommodation for commercial purposes both at the ports and at inland centres, which is considered to be a main cause of delay to the restoration of trade and transport to normal conditions, they have teen endeavouring to free any accommodation occupied by war-like stores in individual cases where the necessity for doing so has been represented to them.   They are not, however, satisfied with the progress which is being made in this direction3,   The extent of such covered commercial storage accommodation belonging to transport undertakings and occupied by Government Departments (excluding property constructed during the war on land belonging to transport undertakings) is about if million square feetc In addition the uncovered storage so occupied is approximately 3i on.,., million square feet.   Details are given in the annexed schedule? All this accommodation is occupied by the1 Government Departments
concerned under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act1916;   Section 13 (2) of this Act provides that:-&quot;Nothing in this Act shall authorise the retention of the possession for more than three months after the termination of the infer of -(a).......................................(b) land belonging to any company or Corporation carrying on a railway, dock, canal, water, or other public undertaking other than land which, having before the commencement of the present War been used for the purposes of the undertaking, had before that date ceased to be used.without the consent of the appropriate Government Department, provided that such consent, if given, shall not authorise the retention of possession for a longer period than three years after the termination of the War&quot;.4*   It is apparent that the intention of this provision was that, unless good cause could be shown in the national interest for extending the occupation, such premises should befreed for commercial purposes within a reasonable time afterthe ter&amp;fcnation of hostilities;   but the delay in the ratification of Peace has given a certain legal sanction to the continuedoccupation of these premises which appears to be opposed to &apos;s Iwhat is thought to have been the intention of the Legislature.5.   The Storage Committee are of opinion that there is sufficient accommodation in Government premises, if fully utilised, to absorb at any rate the bulk of the stores that now occupy covered accommodation so urgently required for Commercial purposes, and which is generally speaking a serious contributory cause of Rail and Dock congestion.6.   It was hoped that the Government accommodation becoming vacant through the sale of surplus stores could be made available for commercial purposes, but owing to the conditions of tenure of the land, the matter is not free from difficulty, and it is doubtful whether any relief in this direction can be counted on in the near future.   This is an additional reason why the Government stores should be gathered as quickly as possible into Government premises and the Commercial storage freed for Commercial purposes.o
t*    0    f*w7,     The Storage Committee therefore basic that the Cabinet should decide that Transit or Warehouse accommodation belonging to Railway, Dockj or .Canal undertaJcings, which is held by Government Departments under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act 1916, must be surrendered not later than tho end of June, unless further occupation is agreed to by the Owners - of- the undertaking   or, failing such agreement, the Storage Committee are satisfied, after considering all the circumstances of the case, that an extension of the period of possession is&apos;.necessary or desirable in the National interest and that&apos;no alternative   Government accommodation is available0 As all the&apos;Government Departments affected are   represented on&apos; the Storage Committee this arrangement would provide an adequate-safeguard for the interest of the Departments, and&apos;, the proposed direction would not apply to buildings etc erected by-the Government&apos; on land belonging to Statutory undertakingso8.     I am in entire accord with the views of the Inter-Departmental Storage Committee, and I recommend strongly that the Cabinet; approve-  the action proposed in paragraph- 7e&apos; -  *- (Signed)   ERIC GEDDES.
