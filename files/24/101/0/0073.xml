Ifthis document 13 the property of his britannic MAJESTY1 S government) ,confidential.&quot; deferred to Mfaira GoPy Wo * -----Committee of Home AffairsCommi0 ABIEET.HOUSE LETTING and RATING (scotland.) BILL. Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland,The main purpose of this Bill is to remedy a grievance which haa arisen in Scotland under the provisions of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts as applying to small dwelling-houses which fall within the scope of the House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Act, 1911*a.Under the latter Act, the owner of/small dwelling-house which is let to a tenant is responsible to the various rating authorities for that portion of the local rates which is imposed upon tho occupier, the theory of the Act being that the owner recouped himself by collecting the rates from the tenant along with, and as part of, the rent.The local rates in Scotland are struck annually, usually after a considerable portion of the assessment year has run (generally about six months), but under the Act of 1911 this caused no serious difficulty, for the owners were free to adjust the rents in the latter half of the year to compensate for any rise in the ratos which was ascertained.when the rates were struck.Under the Increase of Rent, etc. acts.ji however, owners are only entitled to make an. addition to the &quot;standard rent&quot; onthe ground of increases in the occupiers&apos; rates after the rates have been struck, and after certain notice has been given to the oooupier, and such increase cannot be retro-, spective so as to cover the pcrvtion of the assessment year which has run..The present legal position therefore is that where occupiers&apos; rates have risen In any year owners, while responsible to the rating authorities for the rates for the full year at the increased figure, are statutorily debarred from collecting tho increase from tenants during a jortlon of the year.Owing to the large increase in tho rates for the present year (1919-20) as compared with the previous year, the burden Gu owners is a very serious one, snd it has been considered desirable to find a remedy.   Clause 1 of the Bill is designed to effect this remedy and under its provisions the unrecovered increase in occupiers&apos; rates proportionate to the period of occupancy is made a lawful addition to rent which will be recoverable from occupiers as arrears of rent.Clause 2 of the Bill is on the lines of the Statement of Rates Act, 1919. That Act does not apply to Scotland,, and representations have been made on behalf of occupiers of small dwelling-houses in Scotland that a provision such as that contained in the Clause would be ?. valuable safeguard against the exaction by owners of such houses of additions to rent beyond those authorised by law.87th March, 1980.(Signed)     ROBERT MUHRO-
