&quot;TW Document is tfr Property of oftl*His DrItannic Majesty^ Go^nnipnt uu&apos;military Secret, 1340From Viceroy, Foreign, and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India,23rd March 1920.(Received 21-th.)332 S. Please refer to my telegrams, Foreign and Political Department, No. 1406 S. of the 6th October 1919 and No. 1729 S. of 22nd December, and Army Department telegram No. 923 of 22nd January 1920. In first telegram we fore-shadowed probability that permanent occupation of Waziristan might be necessary in long-run, but we did not wish to undertake extended operations necessary, and hoped to be able to bring Mahsuds and Wazirs to submission by minimum measures. In this respect our hopes have not been fulfilled. We have had to undertake extended operations into heart of Mahsud country at considerable expense in men and money, and neither Tochi Wazirs nor Mahsuds have complied with our terms, while we have not yet announced our terms to Waria Wazirs.2. All officers, civil and military, are now agreed that permanent occupation of commanding position in central Waziristan is solution which may ensure peace and security on that part of border and abolish temptation which (? present) weakness of our position in that quarter constantly offers to Afghanistan. We find ourselves reluctantly compelled to accept this opinion. In any case we must remain in Waziristan pending compliance with our terms; but past experience shows that no reliance can be placed on Mahsuds&apos; or Wazirs&apos; good faith, and even if we withdraw on present occasion after obtaining compliance and profession of. submission, we shall probably soon again be faced with necessity and inconvenience of another expensive expedition. We consider, therefore, that it would be mistake to forego the advantage of commanding central position now gained by our forces.3. Our former methods of holding Waziristan, viz., by two widely-separated lines stretching out to Datta Khel and Wana respectively, has proved ineffective in that it left entirely uncontrolled larger and inaccessible central areas inhabited by Mahsuds. Existence of this block or country separating our two lines exposed their flanks to constant Mahsud raids and necessitated employment of unduly large force for their defence. In event of war with Afghanistan their outer flanks are exposed to Afghan aggression also. This unsound position was responsible, in large measure, for situation which arose in Waziristan during war with Afghanistan.4. Course we now propose is to abandon contemplated location of mixed brigade at Sarwekai, and to locate it in neighbourhood of Makin instead, retaining garrison originally proposed for Tochi. This will give us central position in good climate and in heart of Mahsud country from which we can strike in any direction we choose, and from which we will have complete control of Mahsud crops, an important lever with which to exert pressure. Wazir country towards Wano would under new scheme be dominated by chain of frontier constabulary posts probably at Haidari Kach, Sarwekai, Dargai, and Tanai, all within reach of regular posts at Khirgi and Kotkai, and based on mechanical transport road from Khirgi to Sarwekai. From there constabulary could strike at Wazir settlements round Spin (? and) Wano, so that it would not be actually necessary to hold Wano. There would also be constabulary posts at Murtaza and Khajuri Kach. Necessary adjuncts of this proposal would be construction of mechanical transport road connecting Tochi with South Waziristan via Makin, but abandonment of scheme of cantonment at Sarwekai for regular brigade would enable us to dispense with Sarwekai Tanai and Tanai Khajuri Kach roads mentioned in our telegram quoted above. Road from Murtaza to Khajuri Kach is common to both schemes so as to secure communication with Zhob and command of lower positions of Gumal.5. Cost of Sarwekai scheme reported in our telegram of the 22nd January last, 923, must now be wholly modified in view of the changed circumstances. We previously contemplated that Mahsuds would submit completely before occupation of Sarwekai. In present circumstances, occupation either of Sarwekai or Makin. must be in nature of military operations, and, therefore, it will be necessary, inter alia, to retain troops on field service concessions. This at once enhances very largely cost originally estimated of Sanvekai scheme, one item alone of three crores having to be added for field service concessions.   On this basis estimated requirements in troops, &amp;c, under
two schemes compare as follows for whole area, including Dera Ismail Khan, Bannn, lines of.communication, and Tochi occupation which is common to either scheme :  First, interim garrison during consolidation of our position,&apos; and road making(a) under Sarwekai scheme 23  battalions, (b) under Ma kin scheme 24 battalions. .Second, eventual garrison after consoldation (a) under Sarwekai 17 battalions,(b) under Makin scheme 1.7 battalions. Military Works expenditure under either scheme would on revised basis be approximately the same. Permanent accommoda-tion would in any case have to take place of temporary hutting, and under Makin scheme only a slightly greater length of mechanical transport roads would have to be constructed. Mechanical transport roads now proposed are (1) Khirgi via Jandola and Makin to some point in Tochi; (2) Jandola to Sarwekai; (3) Murtaza to Khajuri Kach ; (4) Boy a to Dardoni.C (&apos;? Requirements) in additional constabulary in South Waziristan under two schemes compare as follows : A. Under (a) scheme, 600 men with necessary complement of officers.B. Under Makin scheme, 1,000 men with officers.These would take place of Southern Waziristan Militia, while probably somewhat less number of constabulary on Tochi line would take place of Northern Waziristan Militia. (? Principles of) future organisation of all frontier Militia, constabulary and levies are being discussed in separate telegram.7. Cost (corrupt group), which is approximately equal under both schemes, may be summarised as follows : A. Military expenditure. Six crores, including recurring expenditure for first year, total expenditure in first year being 41 crores, consisting of 3 crores extra food, clothing and other field service concessions for fighting troops, lj crores Military Works expenditure cf roads and buildings, and 25 lakhs additional transport. If field service conditions cease to exist within the year sum of 3 crores mentioned above may be capable of considerable reduction. We must, however, allow for unforeseen contingencies to enable us to overcome possible opposition later in year in direction of Sarwekai, and also in event of its being necessary to Jp.old on this side (? road) through Makin to Tochi in greater force than is at present contemplated. Estimates therefore may be liable to considerable expansion. Normal cost of fighting troops is covered by Budget provision. After consolidation of proposed new positions extra military expenditure should be confined to cost of maintenance of additional roads and some extra cost of transport services, bulk of normal garrison of Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu being transferred to new positions.B. Constabulary expenditure.&apos; Recurring expenditure in South Waziristan, Rs. 4,40,000.Recurring expenditure in Tochi, Rs. 4 lakhs. Total, Rs. 8,40,000. jAgainst this expenditure must be set annual saving of Rs. 14,53,000 by abolition of both Waziristan Militias.Initial expenditure of accommodation 5. lakhs.Cost of accommodation is difficult to estimate accurately as we do not know extent to which former militia buildings have been destroyed.8. One possible objection to scheme now pmposed is that it might unsettle Afridis by giving them the idea that their (? word omitted) will, come next. We think it more likely, however, that strong policy in Waziristan will have deterrent effect on Afridis and elsewhere on frontier, and serve as warning to them against imitating behaviour of Mahsuds. We have no doubt that it would strengthen our position towards Afghanistan by (three corrupt groups) of our frontier.9. We contemplate gradual establishment of very loose form of political adminis-tration over Mahsuds and Wazirs&apos;after consolidation of our position on Makin line, but this need not come immediately.10. In view of approach of hot weather and fact that Mahsuds have not complied completely with terms, it is undesirable to (? move omitted) troops now to Sarwekai or Wano, as it is possible Wana Wazirs, who are reported already collecting rifles and fine in anticipation of announcement of terms, may spontaneously enquire our terms and offer submission. In that event we would accept submission and require compliance within reasonable period. If they do not do so we would defer announce-ment of terms and operations against Wana Wazirs until autumn, when consolidation
of our position in Mahsud country should ensure their submission without much difficulty.11. Great concern has recently been (corrupt group) shown by Indian politicians and vernacular Press at constant raids of settled villages on Waziristan borders, and we have been urged to adopt policy of more stringent control over predatory tribes. We are confident that effective scheme such as we now recommend will find wide-spread support in India. We greatly regret heavy cost involved, but we can evidently not revert to former dangerous plan of militia or constabulary (corrupt group) in exposed positions far from military support. And only two alternative courses left are first to push our permanent military posts further into tribal country, base them on well-consolidated lines of communication, or, second, to abandon control of tribal country altogether and attempt to restrain raiders by line of posts along-unhealthy foot, of hills. Apart from fact that second course would expose Gumal and Zhob, it would entirely fail to protect settled districts, of Derajat, inhabitants of which are entitled to protection. . We are bound, therefore, to choose first, and line of occupation which we now advocate and which we have already won seems strategically soundest. We trust you will be able to sanction our proposals at very early date as arrangements must be begun immediately to accommodate troops during hot weather.
