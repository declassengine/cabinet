(Jalli.Colonel Castoldi.THE CONFERENCE TOOK NOTE OF TIPS FOLLOWING INTRODUCTION TO THE DRAFT ARTICLES.Subject to the reservation made below in this report the Committee unanimously recommend the attached chapter-containing draft and articles and oh annex.     They wish at the same time to explain as briefly as possible the following principal considerations, by which they were guided in drawing up their report.1.    They feel that objections are less likely to be raised to the powers of the proposed Commission of the Straits by countries non-signatory of the Turkish Treaty if this Commission derives its powers technically from the Turkish/Government
Government (Article 2), for this reason, also, article 18 dealing with the levying of dues maintains in principle the existing categories of dues levied in the Straits.2.   3?or the same reason (objections from non-signatory countries) the Committee have endeavoured to make the Commission as far as possible, in its powers and functions, analogous to the Danube Commission.     (This analogy cannot however be closely pressed and the status of the Suez, and Panama Canals has had also to be borne in mind in dealing with the position as regards the transit of vessels in peace and war - articles 1 and 22-2&apos;7)*5,   Squally for the above reasons, the Committee suggest in Article IS that the dues and charges should be utilised only for the costs and expenses of the administration and expenditure on necessary works, etc., and not for the payment  . of salaries ofrthe Commissioners themselves or, as has been contemplated, for the payment of the military and naval . forces in the demilitarised zone.4.     Similarly the Committee have not made the military and naval forces of the zone subordinate to the Commission but have merely given the Commission power to requisition their aid in case of emergency (Article 8).     On this point the French and Italian delegates wish to make the res3rvation that -in their opinion the military and naval forces occupying the zone should be placed completely under the control of the Commission,     Other-vise they fear confusion resulting from lack of co-ordination.,     The British delegates felt unable to accept such an extension of the functions of the Cormnissiien, They do not in practice fear that the forces will not he available for the Commission in case of necessity (article 8),and-
and they consider that tne Commission is not intended and would not be fitted by its composition to exercise those mill i.ary funet;i ons.     The Committee presume, however, that tills quo st:: on of the Command over these forces will be dec!dad by the Supreme Council,The Committee understand that the Commissions on International Ports, Waterways and Railways intend, in connection with the articles which they are drafting for insertion in tho Turkish Treaty, to make Constantinople a free port with a free zone and Haidar Pasha a free port,They therefore recommend that this report, to the extent approved by the SupremeuCouncil, should be referred to the above Commission, with instructions to suggest, if necessary, amendments in the articles attached to this report with a view to bring them into conformity with their proposals for the ahove mentioned ports.The Committee also desire to recommend that the report should be referred to tho joint military and naval Commission with o request for their views on articles 1, 8 and 22 toLONDON.February 27th.3.
2. The Conference agreed that the draft articles as amended by them should be referred to the Inter-Allied Commission of Railwaya, Waterways, etc.3.
