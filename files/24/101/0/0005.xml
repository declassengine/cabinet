Resolutions condemning Turkish atrocities in Armenia, addressed to the Secretary of thePeace Conference.27 Finsbury Square, London, S.C.To the Secretaryof the Peace fia&amp;ference.Sir,We have the honour to submit to you for the consideration of the Peace Conference the following Resolutions passed unanimously at a Public Meeting held in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, 14th March, 1920,sit 3-30 P*m*&apos; Mr. Aneurin Williams, M.P., being in the Chairt       That this mass meeting off Londoners expresses its^iiprrdr   * and detestation of the recent massacres of Ch.risp.anB by Turkish forces in Cilicia. occurring, as they aid, in territory for which Prance and Britain were responsi-ble, it emphatically protests against the neglect of those powers which rendered them possible. It remembers that these massacres are but a continuance of the Turkish Government&apos;s policy long secretly pursued and formulated and declared during the late War, that policy being to exterminate theiiiole Armenian race, as Turkey for 100 years has sought to destroy one subject race after another which dared to aspire to decent government or liberty. It demands that the Allied Governments, and our own Govern-ment in particular, shall immediately take all necessary   -steps to secure the liberty and safety of the subject races of Turkey, giving them immediately what arras they require for self-protection, and that they should be placed under the guidance and protection of the League of Nations.2,   That inasmuch as while Constantinople remains the capital of the Turkish State, the ambition to create a great all-Turkish Empire will persist, and inasmuch as this dream has been the admitted motive of the massacres of the past century, this meeting calls on the British Government to secure the prompt removal of the Sultan from ]$europe.3.   That in view of the fact that a multitude of Christian women and little girls, after the slaughter of their prptectors and parents, have suffered forced conversion to Islam and been enslaved in Turkish harems, the Government should insist upon a Commission of European and Native Christian Members to examine into the facts, and to rescue such victims and return them to their homes.We have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant,i.(Sgd.) ANKJRIN WILLIAMS. Chairman&quot;      H.J. TOTES-CLINTON, Hon. Secretary.
