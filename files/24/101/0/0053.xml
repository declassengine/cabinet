..j aPolitical Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.Finland/006.Till:   NiJKT IP FINLAND.The Coalition Go- eminent under M. Vennola vith h. Holsti ar Finis ter for Foreign A;i fairr. resigned on March 3 and a nev Government under Prefer: or Erich vat. formed on March 15.M. Vennola&apos;s Government, which vas a Coalition of the Progres i ive and the Agrarian parties, came into evis tence last rummer after I&quot;.. Stahlberg&apos; i election ar. Prer ident.   Out of 200 zeats in the Diet the two parties from vhich the Government was formed held only 64, so that it never obtained an absolute majority and v;as forced r ometimes to conciliate the Left and some timer the Right,    In practice the Government inclined steadily tevrrds the Left both on the question of peace \ ith Soviet Rusa la and of the amnesty for thoce who took part in the Civil War on the side cf the Rede. . It vas the latter question that finally lee to the Government crisis and h. Vennola1i resignation.The Amnesty Bill vrs ratified, by the President on January 30, whereupon four members of the Government resigned:.     K, Vennola immediately invited the Socialists to fill the vacant seats in the Government;   upon their refusal he applied to the two parties to the Right of the Government, viz. the Kokoomus (Coalition) Party,- consisting of Conservative Finns-, and the Swedish Folks-party, consisting of Conservative Swedes.   These two parties replied by insisting on a reconstruction of the Government programme &quot;both internal and foreign before they would co-operate.     M. Vennola refused to pledge himself and thereupon endeavoured to fill the Government vith further
reprec entstiver from the Progressive and Agrarian parties. These negotiation;  continued throu hout the \ hole cf Febvuarym but cai-x to nothing and on larch 3 the Government resigned in a body.Professor Erich was nor called upon to fcrin a new Coalition Government which he succeeded in doing; on March 15.     To placate the Allies M. Holsti Mediterranean retained as Minister ion Foreign Affaire and Professor Erich, in his first statement of foreign policy, hinted, though in vague term?, that the policy of peace vith Soviet Russia would bo pursued.      \ ith the oreopt ion of H. Holsti (progressive) and M. Lavonlus (Progresr ive), the majority of the Government belong to the pro-German parties of the Right.   These parties&apos; arc in close touch with General Mannerheim who is reporter to have rone over-to the pro-German side durin,;: the las it   few months.In the Cabinet Itself the throe leading representatives of the pro-German party &apos;rre Professor&apos;Erich (Prime Minister), Colonel Yalandcrj (Van) and K. Ingman (Public Instruction). Professor Erich is a Swedish Finn, though he belongs to the Kokoomus party.   Ho is a professor of International Law and assisted the notoriously pro-German Hjelt in drai ing up the Finno-German Treaty in 1918.   Dr. Ingman, who was for a short time Prime Minister during Mannerheimr s regency, is also a member of the Kokoomus party.   He is one of Mannerheim&apos;s:close associates and during 1918 was one of the first to acclaim a German Prince as King of Finland. &quot;But apart from the Cabinet other changes are being, made in favour of the pro-German party. It is reported that Enckel, the present Chief of Staff, is to be replaced and that two pro-Germans, Hollenius and Hongiste, are to be given important posts, the latter to be made Chief of
Police   Hongirto \ t \ deported from Norway during the van for espionage in favour of.the Germans.   Apart from this&apos;there ir grovinf German influence among the military command and the officer;  of&apos; the: Protective Guards.The no.  Government has already had a very had reception from the press of the Progressive and Agrarian parties \ ho believe that it will endeavour to block the peace vith Soviet Russia;. M. Holsti still believes that he can continue hit former policy, but he aill find it increasingly difficult to do so vith his present colleagues.   The Socialists are already discussing the pa or peett  of&apos; throwing out the present Government vith the help of the Left Centre who v.ill now fee throvn more and more into the arms of the social.lif.tr .It will be seen,  therefore,, that political affairs are nov in a critical state.     The policy of m.oderation pursued by the former Government is being undermined and Finnish society ir. again being elvided into two sharply antagonistic camps - the Right and the Left.     K. Holsti still hopes to preserve a Centre policy but the chances of success are rapidly disappearing. There arc constant rumours that tho Rede rre planning a rising at tho end of Parch and that they feel that their prospects of success are better nov than they have  ever been.     At the same time there are rumours that Mannerheim and his supporters are also planning a coup d&apos;etat.     It is probable that the movements of Mannerheim and his party are closely connected vith the move-merits of the militarists in Germany.     Mannerheim was supposed to hove been in touch with Ludendorff and his organisation, and if the latter had proved successful in Germany there is strong reason to think that a similar movement, would, have been attempted in Finland,,   Hoy. that tho movement has collapsed in Germany it doer
no  r.-;     onau*not seem likely that Manncrheim will&apos; precipitate matters in Finland especially as the neve Government Is partly under his influenceo   It if more reasonable to believe, therefore, that in view of events in Germany the Reds are more likely to precipitate; a crisis than the YJhites, and it Is impossible not to be anxious lest further internal strife in Germany may lead to renewed civil war in Finland in which Mannerheim would again try to play the leading role as the saviour of Finland.- I I
