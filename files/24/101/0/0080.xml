Thi3 Document is the Property of His Britannic b1^o^y&apos;s Government. /Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill.NOTES ON CLAUSES. Clause 4.This clause makes the necessary alterations in the Army Act in view of the proposed substitution of the rank of &quot;colonel commandant&quot; for the rank of &quot;brigadier-general.&quot;* Clause 5.This clause abolishes regimental courts-martial in the army. These courts are not held under the Air Force Act.Clause 6.This clause remedies a defect in the Act whereby a court-martial can pass upon an officer of His Majesty&apos;s Indian Eorcee a sentence of forfeiture of service for promotion, but cannot at the same time order the offender to be severely reprimanded or reprimanded. In the case of other officers a sentence of forfeiture of seniority of rank can already be combined with a sentence of reprimand or severe reprimand.Clause 7.Under ss. 46a and s. 183 of the Air Force Act certain powers are limited to officers not below air rank. As such officers are not always available, it is proposed by this clause to enable these powers in special circumstances, with the consent of the Air Council, to be exercised by a group captain.Clauses 8 and 9. *The effect of these clauses is to substitute 24 years for 21 years as the total period up to which an airman may re-engage after completing the term of his original enlistment.Clause 10.This clause extends to aircraft the provisions of s. 115 (10) of the Air Force Act, which prohibit the unauthorised sale and purchase of horses where a requisition of emergency has been issued.* These clauses give effect to recommendations of the Committee constituted by the Army Council, on 10th April 1919, to inquire into the law and rules of procedure regulating military courts-martial.8-9 a
&apos; Clause 11.This clause and the Schedule referred to in it make the amendments in the Air Force Act which are necessary as a result of the new designations now applicable to air-force officers.* Clause 12.Under section 44* of the Army Act there is at present no power in a court-martial to award a reprimand or a severe reprimand to a warrant officer or non-commissioned officer. This clause will confer that power and will also enable a court-martial to award a reprimand or severe reprimand to a warrant or non-commissioned officer in addition to a sentence of forfeiture of seniority.* Clause 13.This clause removes the distinction contained in section 48 between general courts-martial convened in the United Kingdom, India, Malta and Gibraltar and those convened elsewhere. The minimum number of members is fixed at live wherever the Court is convened, and the minimum number of members who must be not below  he rank of captain is reduced from five to four.&quot;Clause 14.This clause provides that a finding of acquittal shall always be pronounced at once in open court even when the accused, is found guilty of other charges.* Clause 15.This clause provides for the perpetuation of the provisions which have been in force during the war for the suspension of a sentence of penal servitude, imprisonment, or detention with a view to the sentence being ultimately avoided altogether if the person on whom it is passed acquits himself satisfactorily.&apos;*Clause 16.This clause will enable the summary of evidence on the investigation of a charge to be taken on oath.* These clauses give effect to recommendations of the Committee constituted by the Army Council, ou 10th April 1919, to inquire into the law and rules of procedure regulating military courts-martial.
Clause 17.Under section 81 a recruit may purchase his discharge at any time within three months of his attestation upon payment of ten pounds.   This clause substitutes twenty pounds.9Clause 18.This clause makes it clear that the power of billeting soldiers in victualling houses, includes power to billet them in unlicensed inns and hotels.* Clause 19.. This clause will enable a person who has been acquitted by a court-martial, and also the next-of-kin of a person who has been tried by court-martial and since died, to obtain a copy of the proceedings.* Clause 20.This clause provides for the compulsory attendance, at the taking of a summary of evidence, of civilian, witnesses.Clause 21oThis clause enables deductions from pay to be made after due investigation in cases where barrack damage or loss has been caused by the unit to which a soldier belongs.Clause 22.This clause provides for an increase in the deduction which may be made from the pay of a soldier for the maintenance of his wife and children.   The present rates are: Warrant officer (Class I.), in respect of wife or children,Is. Id., and in respect of a bastard child, Is. Id. Warrant officer (Class II.) and N.C.O.&apos;s not below rank ofsergeant, in respect of wife or children, 1*. Id., and inrespect of a bastard child, 8d. Other soldiers, in respect of wife or children, 9d., and inrespect of a bastard child, 6d.Clause 23.This clause perpetuates provisions hitherto contained hi Regulations 43a and 40c of the Defence of the Realm Regu-lations.* These clauses give effect to recommendations of the Committee constituted by the Army Council, on 10th April 1919, to inquire into the law and rules of procedure regulating military courts-martial.
Clause 24.Section 158 of the Army Act provides that a person who ceases to be subject to military law shall not be triecl for an offence committed by him whilst he was so subject after the expiration of three months. The effect of this is that officers and men of the Air Force who are temporarily attached to the army and whilst so attached commit an offence against military law cannot be tried for the offence more than three months after they are restored to the Air Force. It is also impossible to try such man under Air Porce law as he wras not subject to that law when the offence was committed. He is therefore liable to escape altogether, and this clause remedies the defect in the law hereby disclosed.Clause 25.This clause contains the modifications necessary to apply Part III. to the Air Force.Clause 26.This clause and the Schedule to which it refers provide for the repeal of certain enactments consequential on clause 10, and also for the repeal of those parts of the Air Porce (Constitution) Act, 1917, which make amendments of the Army Act apply automatically to the Air Porce Act.Clause 27.This clause reproduces as respects the Air Porce Act the provisions of section 14 of the Army (Annual) Act, 1904.
