EC R E T.TREATY WITH TURKEY&apos;.* J *IX 5 *REPORT OP PORTS) VJATER7AYS AND RAILWAYS COMMISSION RELATIVE TO THE PORTS OF CONST A NT 1110? LE AND HAIDA PASHA,In considering th* question of the Ports of ConBttui-tinoplo-^. and Haidsi Pasha in relation to the draft Articles on tho ad-ministration of tho Waterways of the Straits and the Sea of Marmora, the ports, Waterways and Railways Commission have taken into consideration three separate aspects of the canes-la).   The Commercial working and development of the Docks and Quays of Constantinople and Haida Pasha: (b).   The International regime of these portsnecessary to assure the freedom, equality and continuity of their use by vessels Nationals and goods of all nations; (c). Control by the High Commission of the Straits, As regards (a) the Ports, Waterways and Railways Commission consider that the greatest efficiency is likely to resuH if the working and development of these Ports ii left entirely to Commercial enterprise, and that the undertaking of such func-tions by the Commission should only be contemplated as a last resorts   At the same time, they are informed that the lighterage of these ports is at present under an exceptional regime which -is not controlled by the authorities responsible for the working of the wharves, and it is therefore proposed that lighterage should be expressly placed under the general control of the High Commission. ;As regards (b) the. Ports, Waterways and Railways Commission have had the advantage pf a.draft Convention for International Ports framed with reference to Its possible application to the Port of Constantinople; this draft Convention was first con-sidered by the Ports,(Waterways and Railways Commission of theiParis Peace Conference and has subsequently been reviewed by thejCommission of Inquiry on Freedom of Comrnunications and Transit
now sitting at Paris, on which several neutral nations are represented.   The Commission have therefore found no difficulty in adopting in substance the latest available draft of this con-vention.   These provisions are Included in the PQrts, Waterways and Railways Articles in view of the proposal to apply them also to ports, other than Constantinople.    .It may also be considered desirable to apply them later to the mandatory Ports of Alexandretta, Haifa and Basra.As regards (c), and in view of the observations made under (a) above, it is proposed that the powers of the High Commission should include the control necessary to assure the execution at the ports of Constantinople and Haida Fasha of the international regime referred to In (b), and that all complaints relative to this regime should be referred to the High Commission in the first Instance.Finally, it is suggested that, provided the control of the armed forces is not part of the functions of the High Commission, the latter should be recognised as acting on behalf of the League of Nations, any disp\ites between States affecting the regime of the whole of the Straits which cannot be adjusted by the High Commission being settled as provided by the League of Nations. The adoption of this proposal would be in conformity with the principles of the Ports, Waterways and Railways Articles in the other Treaties.The modifications and additions to the draft Articles circulated on the 2nd March (A.J. 51A) resulting from the above recommendations would be as follows Article 7.(a)   Delete &quot;docks or Quays&quot;. Article 7.(e)   Delete, and substitute &quot;The control necessary to assure the execution at the Ports of Constantinople and Haida Pasha of , the regime prescribed in Articles..... to..... of the present Treaty (Articles 8 to 17 of the Ports Waterways and Railways clauses - International Ports and Free Zones)&quot;Art.7.
Article 7,(g)   Delete and. substitute &quot;The control of lighterage&quot;. Article 11.Liner. 5 and 6.   Delete the words &quot;of the administration of the Straits&quot;; and at the end of the same Article add &quot;or Itself to take up a new concession&quot;. Hew Article 29.Any Differe ces which may arise between States as to the interpretation or- execution of the Articles in this chapter and as regards Constantinople and HaIda Pasha of Articles.....to..... of the present Treaty (Articles 8 to 17 of the Ports,Waterways and Railways clauses - International Ports and Free Zones) shall be referred to the Commission.   In the event of the decision of the Commission not being accepted by any State, on the demand of any State concerned the question shall be settled as provided by the League of Nations, pending whose decision the ruling of the Commission will be carried out.Articles 7, 11 and 29 as revised under these proposals are annexed hereto.H.O.
