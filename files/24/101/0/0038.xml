j C R E T. -Copy No.__. J. 110, SUPgglg COUNCIL,SUPPL1M Iff ARY- REPORT.Committee On protection of Minorities.inTFirfey],The Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Council of Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors examined the Memorandum (A.J. 95) of the Greek Delegation, suggesting certain clauses for insertion in the section of the Treaty dealing with the protection of minorities in Turkey.As the Greek Memorandum quoted the articles which the Greek Delegation desired to insert, and fully explained their purport, the Committee did not consider it necessary to hear M. Venizelos personally on the subject.Taking the numbered paragraphs of the Greek Memorandum in turn, the Committee unanimously decided as follows:1.   It was desirable to insert, after the second paragraph of Artiole 6 of the chapter on the protection of minorities already recommended to and approved by the Council, the following paragraph;. &quot;Le Gouvernement ottoman present era dans un delai de deux ans apres la mise en vigueur du present traite aux Puissances Alliees un projet d1organisation du systeme eleotoral base aur le principe de la representation proportionelle de &quot;minorites ethniques/2.   These desiderata&apos;are already sufficiently oovered tfby the general protection afforded by the draft articles, already approved and by the provisions of article 5*3*   This paragraph suggests 3 additional artilies.     the Committee considered that the first two were already met by the provisions of the existing artioles&apos; Nos.:2 and 3*   As regards the third suggested article the Committee recommend the insertion of the following paragraph at the end of the existing article 2:
f&quot;Les atteintes au libre exercice de oultes soront punis dcp memekpeines, quclquo soit le cultc intcresse.4.     The Commit tee considcrvd this suggestion valuab1c and recommend-the following article either to follow immediately upon Ho,6 of the existing draft articles or to be inserted in such other place in the treaty as the drafting Committee may consider appropriate.&quot;Le Gouvcmement ottoman reconnaitra la validite des diplomes emanant d&apos;universite ou d1ecoles etrangeres reconnues et admettra les porteurs au libre exercice des professions et industries auxquelles oes diplomes qnalifient.   Ces dispositions sTappliqueront egalement aux ressortissants des puissances alliees residant en Turquie&quot;.5. This suggestion is adequately covered by an article which figures in the Committee1 a recommendations&quot;dealing with the provisions to be inserted in the Turkish Treaty regarding changes of nationality.6.     The Committee consider that article 5 of the existing draft articles as already approved as well as the general measure of protection afforded by Nos,2, 6, 7 .and 9 of the existing draft articles cover, as far as is possible or desirable, the suggestions made in this paragraph.7.     The Committee did not feel able to acoept this suggestion which raised too large a question of interference in Ottoman legislation and in particular the question of judicial reform.8.     The Committee considered that the article suggested in this paragraph was sufficiently covered by the general protection afforded to minorities by article 7 of the existing draft articles .9.   The article suggested in this paragraph is practically identic with the provisions of article 7 of the existing draft articles ,
10.     The Committee considered that this suggestion was already met, as far as was desirable or practicable by the concluding paragraph of article 6 of tho existing draft articles,11,   This suggestion is identic with that embodied in IT0.12 of the original draft articles which it has since been decided to suppress and replace by e general su3pensary article, pending consultation with the Council of ithe League of Nations.12,   Article 9 of the existing draft articles covers the proposals made by the Greek delegation in this paragraph,In submitting this report the Committee venture to suggest that if the Council consider it desirable to reply to the Greek Delegation1 s memorandum, the Greek Delegation might be informed in general terms, and with en expression of thanks, that their proposals have been examined by the competent commission and that articles have been drafted for insertion in the treaty, which cover the points raised by the Greek Delegation to the exten-ti considered desirable or practicable by the Council.London,March 19th, 1920,
