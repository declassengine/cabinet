annuities and all the powers as to Land Purchase- vested in the Congested Districts Board   other than the power,o.^ requiring advances to &quot;be made to them.(b) Police,Both reserve the Royal Irish Constabulary - the Aat of 1914- for 6 years, the Bill for 3 years or until Union, which ever is the sooner.    On the other hand, the Bill reserves the Dublin Metropolitan Police for the same period as the Royal Irish Constabulary, whereas under the Act cf 1914 the Dublin Metropolitan Polioe was to be transferred immediately the Bill also provides for the constitution of a body on which the Irish Governments are represented for the administration of the police during the period cf reserva-ticn;   no such provision was included in the Ant of 1914,(fl) Savings Banks *Beth reserve Savings Banks; the Act of 1914 for a maximum period of 10 years, the Bill until provision is, made for the joint administration of the services.( d) Health Insurance &amp; Jricndly Societies,Unemployment Insurance &amp; Labour ffxfl!hangos. These matters are reserved by the Act of 1914 Irat not by the Bill,     Under the Act cf 1914-, the Irish PaiV liament could obtain a transfer of the services ,on pass-^ng a resolution to that effect, Wt not in the -eas-e\cf^ ^friendly societies before the expiration of 10 years,(e)Publio Record Office,This matter is reserved by the Bill, but not by the: Act 0f 1914.     Under the Bill, it is only reserved -until provision is made for joint administration.
3. - TAXATION.Under the Act of 1914 the imposition, levying, and collection of all Imperial taxes remained with the Parliament and Government of the United Kingdom., the Irish Parliament being given -(a) a limited power of varying by way of addition customs duties;(b) a limited power of varyinp excise duties;(c) a power to vary exemptions, abatements and &quot;reliefs from., but not the rate of, income tax and super-tax;(d) a power of varying death duties, except so as to impose an additional duty on the personal property cf a person domiciled in Great Britain;(e) a power to vary stamp duties, with certain exceptions;(f) a power to vary any other Imperial tax;(g) a power to impose independent taxes not being substantially the same in character as an Imperial tax.The levying and collection of all taxes, whether Imperial or Ir* sh, remained vested in the authorities of the United Kingdom.Under the Bill, the power of imposing, levying and collection of(a) customs duties and exc*&apos;se duties on articles manufactured and produced,(b) income tax and super-tax,(c) excess profits dutyare reserved to the authorities of the United Kingdom, but the Irish Parliaments are given powers to vary the
in rates of income tax upwards from downwards.    Tho imposition, levying and collection of all other taxes is transferred to the Irish authorities, who will therefore be able to have full control over -(a) death duties;(b) stamp duties;(o) entertainments duty;(d) excise licence duties (other than liquor licences);(e) independent taxes, not te ing substantially the same in character a3 any of the reserved taxes.Both the Act of 1914 and the Bill contemplate the possibility of additional powers of taxation being sub-sequently oonferre^n the Irish Parliament.The ground of such a revision of fl. financial relations under the Act of 1914 is a report by the Irish Exchequer Board that the revenue receipts from Ireland have for 3 years exceeded the expenditure on Ireland;   on such a report being presented the Act of 1914 contemplates an Irish contribution to Imperial expenditure, and the extension of the powers of the Irish Parliament with respect to the imposition  -and collection of taxes.The Bill privides in the case of Irish Union for the Joint Ex chequer Board talcing into consideration, if moved thereto by the Irish Parliament, the transfer to the Irish Parliament of the powers of imposing and collecting customs and excise duties. 4,-&quot;SUPREME COURT.Under the Bill, all matters relating to the Supreme Courts (including registration of deeds and title to  . land) and the High Court of Appeal are reserved until Union. In the Act of 1914 there is   no such reservation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.r,/l 24th March,1920
