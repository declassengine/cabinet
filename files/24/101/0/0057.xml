I circulate a telegram which has been received fromthe Senior Naval Officer in the Baltic, indicating that as soon as the ice conditions permit, the ships of the Bolshevist Fleet may proceed to sea to attack Finnish and Latvian ports.*Until January last they were restrained from proceed-ing to sea for offensive action by a British Naval Force main-talned in those waters.   Since then, ice conditions in the Gulf of Finland hav-: prevented their egress.The prevailing weather conditions make it probable that the ice will shortly dissappear, leaving the Bolshevist ships free to emerge.British Ships are now under orders to abstain from all offensive action against the Soviet Government.   A decision is urgently, necessary whether these instructions are to hold good in the event of the anticipated attack on Finnish and Latvian Ports taking place.        If not, is the,British Fleet, to evacuate the Baltic, or is a force sufficient to meet the Bolshevist Fleet to be sent thither ?&apos;The Admiralty are of opinion that it is ntit yet too late to Insist on the internment of the Bolshevist Fleet, and the immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts, as the price of the Allies opening up relations with the Soviet Government.(Intlld)   W. H. L.-    -   2,5. 3. 20.
TELE G R A I\I.    &apos;Prom: S.ft.0. Baltic./ Date; 22.5.20...To:     Admiralty.153.   General Turner states that a secret service Agent reports Bolsheviks getting fleet ready for sea in order to harass Finnish and Latvian ports and impose unfavourable peace terms.   Although he cannot gauge reliability of report he considers it a contingency that should be guarded against said asks what action British Fleet would take.In view of defenceless state of Baltic Provinces on the sea I consider if possible Soviet Government be told that this would not be tolerated by the Allies, and If not already done the handing over or effectual disarmament of all their ships be insisted on before any negotiations take place with them on other matters.
