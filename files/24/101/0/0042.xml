The Commission at their second meeting to-day had under con-sideration a note submitted by the French delegates, of which a copy is enclosed.2.     The Commission are of opinion that unless it is intended by the supreme council to subject Turkey to some special control of her civil administration, such as is outlined in paragraph 3 of the French note, the   aerial navigation clauses in the Treaty *&quot;f Peace with Turkey should follow those already adopted in the Treaties of Peace with Germany, Austria and Bulgaria, and articles drawn up on this supposition are submitted herewith for the con-sideration of the suprame Council.3.     If on the other hand it is the policy of the Supreme Council to subject the civil administration of Turkey to some such con* trol, the Commission would ask to be informed as to this, policy, and to be given an opportunity of reconsidering these draft articles with a view to modifying them where necessary in order to conform with the policy of the Supreme Council.v^I am 1     Sir, &apos;  Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)

Les Comixes techniques ont unanimement reconnu qulil n1existait aucun moyen pratique d&apos;empecher une Aviation citile de se transformer rapidement en Aviation Militaire (voir Annexe 2 du Rapport de la Commission Aeronautique a la Conference des Preliminaires de Paix).   II y a tout lieu de craindre si aucune mesure de controle n&apos;est prevue, de voir se developper k 1&apos;a.bri du Traite de Paix et sous une facade turque une Aviation Civile entre les maine des puissances centrale3* On ne saurait passer sous silence ce danger eventuel qui est drautan&apos; plus a eviter que les territories turcs senv&amp;t par leur situation geographique un des principaux points de passage des futures lignes aeriennes*
