Please refer to&apos;Minister at Peking&apos;s telegram 46, dated 28th January 1920. British Consular protection to Afghans abroad. Good offices of our Consular officers have hitherto been extended to Afghans abroad, and this has been generally recognised by Foreign Powers. Afghanistan having now claimed independence in conduct of her foreign relations, our Consular (? protection) should be withdrawn, but we have hitherto (? not) raise(d) the question.In Chinese Turkestan our Consul-General reports that; Chinese authorities have refused to admit Afghan Consul, Kashgar, and at same time refuse to recognise any longer our right to protect Afghan subjects. Consul-General, Kashgar, wishes Chinese Government to be pressed to recognise this right. But, seeing that we have definitely surrendered control of Afghanistan^ foreign relations, we consider we are no longer justified in continuing old arrangement against the wishes of local authorities, and in face of evidence of desire of Afghan Government that their subjects should no longer be dependent on our Consular protection. We therefore recommend withdrawal of our Consular aid and protection from Afghans in Chinese Turkestan. If Chinese authorities persist in refusal to allow Afghan Consulate in Kashgar, and better class of Afghans suffer loss of our protection, Afghan Government may realise difficulty and inconvenience of situation. We do not anticipate that our prestige at Kashgar would suffer materially, and it would be powerful lever in our hands if Afghan Government were forced to apply to us for aid.Early orders are (? requested).
