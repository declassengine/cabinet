It is not a question of the dissatisfaction of farmers, but of the repudiation of a definite undertaking entered into by the Ministry of Food when farmers were urged to produce meat for the spring and early summer of 1920 at guaranteed prices.   Sir Joseph Maclay^ argument that &quot;no sympathy exists towards farmers&quot;, even if it were well founded, does not seem good ground for breaking faith with \hem. In any case the Government has recently decided that it could not break the bargain which it had made with the farmers of the. United Kingdom, even though a majority of the English farmers were willing and anxious to release the Government from its pledge.   It is true that no guarantee to take all the livestock presented on a, given date was ever given but the promise of a market was always Implicit in the conditions; indeed the Ministry of Food have throughout stated that the meat would be wanted.   To close the market for a month or even a fortnight would be a. flagrant evasion of a definite undertaking and would inflict losses upon farmers that could not be-&apos;met by any scale of compensation because the contingent dislocation of hisGopy^N vIn effect it contemplates the destruction of the live
business could not be assessed. Such a breach of faith would have a ruinous effect upon the supply of meat next winter when it will bo badly needed.Hor would the consumer tolerate the cutting off of the supply of home grown meat.    Many sections of the community, not least the working classes, will not accept the long stored Australasian meat, and, so far from having no sympathy with farmers in this matter, would insist on being allowed to purchase the home grown meat to which they are accustomed.Apart from the moral and social obj elections to the proposal of the Shipping Controller, I doubt whether it would be physically possible, in the present state of transport congestion, to supply the consuming public with imported meat-only .L of p.24th March, 1920 .
