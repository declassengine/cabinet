this DOGl rflcru iu -:&apos;, rtiumw******rront.25th March, 1920V B R N M E NT3 U S I N E SOn* memorandum for, the, Cabinet &quot;by the First Lord ..of ...tb.G,. ArLyair&amp;.lty..-FfiRFTi*- I I venture to asTi my colleagues to consider thesituation in Parliament I believe it to be frailigi t with grave peril to the reputation-, more than, to the existence of the Government *I am not afraid of the latter because I see no opponent with a policy or organization likely to succeed; but events move rapidly in the political world - and we may soon see a formidable combination arrayed against us, and I think we ought to avoid giving them any unnecessary opportunities for attach the Home Rule&apos; Bill is by far the most important and the most urgent measure in our programme *     I am convinced that we can pass it; and I believe that ultimately it will be accepted in South as woII as in North Ireland; and eventually worked with1 no small degree of success^ But if we are to pass it--, we must give no ground for cooperation in opposition between those who are anxious to wreek the Bill and others who would support us if it were not for tho fact that they are strongly opposed toother measures*      This will toad them to adopt the old parliamentary practice of opposing A* in order to keep off Bo and Go      Further, the time at our disposal is limited:   Members are tired? and will view an autumn Session with great hostility-My conclusion, therefore, iS that we should very carefully consider the time at our disposal; make up our minds that Parliament shall be prorogued in August -that we shall not have an Autumn Session - and in order to secure these results? we must .at onoe decide what legislation we can pass-     Does any one of my colleagues believe that we   c.ia.n  do more than pass into law the Home Rulo Bill anda few minor measures?There is one remark I should like to mako hero* Many of our difficulties arise from the fact that our legislation is considered and prepared whilst Parliament is sitting and when, therefore, members of the Cabinet are overwhelmed with work and have^ittle time to devote to the consideration and preparation of the Bills.     We have before us now several measures which I am convinced will prove, if they are introduced in anything like their present form, to be violently contentious.     I will very briefly allude to one or two of them*First, the Intoxicating Liquor (Regulation) Bill* I will content myself with simply saying that, for my own part 9 I do not see how I could support the Bill in its present forma     I am strongly opposed to local option, both on principle and as a federalists other powers in the Bill- are too drastic s I believe all that Is necessary is to maintain what is in the existing control, and in other respects to wait until we have more time before we attempt to pass an ambitious measureThis is exactly the kind of Bill which would arouse immense hostility in Parliament and in tho country; and I am satisfied that the advocates of the Trade and of what is commonly called the liberty of the subject, would combine in fighting the Home Rule Bill in order to make the passage of this Bill impossible^I think several too ambitiousogood/Secondly,
j*teoohcll,yj thw Agriculture Bill:)   I do not know whether my colleagues have studied the proposals in this Bill: they seem to me to he very far-reachingo   Icon only say for myself that if this Bill :!&quot;0 introduced in anything like its present form, and its rejection were moved ? I should find it very difficult to vote against the motion -and I should be quite unable to conceal&quot;my views,   I cannot help thinking that many agriculturalists will share my views.? The introduction of this Bill weuld lead its opponents $ as in the Liquor Bill, to fight the Home Rule Bill in order to keep this off aI &quot;believe that if Parliament is assured that wo intend to pass the Home Rule Bill with as little delay as possible, and that we do not intend to crowd tho Session with four or five Bills, each of which is of first-rate importance and sufficient as the one great measure of a Session^ that we shall with c02np3.ratj.ve ease accomplish our task - and tho rest can remain until we have another opportunity^(IntlldO     W.H*L*25.3.20*
