General.Payment by Results in the Engineering Trade.The question of payment by results is at present engaging the close attention of employers and trade unions in the engineering industry. The immediate problem is not a clear-cut issue. The whole question is connected with that of working arrangements in general, and has arisen in this case out of the negotiations which have been proceeding for over a year between the Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federation and the unions connected with the engineering industry. These negotiations have been con-concerned in the main with questions connected with the introduction of the 47-hour week. At a special conference held at York on the 14th and 15th January, 1920, the employers raised the question of payment by results, while the trade union representatives pressed for the prior consideration of other questions, such as consolidation of wages, involved in the negotiations. After discussion it was decided that the conference should be adjourned in order that the representatives should consult their constituent bodies. At the resumed conference on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th February the em-ploy ers announced that they were prepared to proceed with the negotiations (i.e.,. the general negotiations connected with the introduction of the 47-hour week) provided(0 1980) 150 3/20 h &amp;S u
that in any agreement on working conditions arrived at with the representatives of the unions &quot; provision shall be made whereby the representatives of the unions agree to recommend to their members that the employers shall have freedom to introduce systems of payment by results satisfactory to the men and the employers concerned.&quot; The trade union representatives then stated their readiness to proceed with the negotiations and to discuss the question of payment by results and to endeavour to arrive at terms which could be mutually recommended to members of the unions on the one hand and employers&apos; associations on the other. This was accepted by the employers who sub-mitted comprehensive proposals with regard not only to payment by results but also to overtime, night shift, holidays and apprentices. These proposals were to be read and construed together and were to be subject to acceptance as a whole. So far as payment by results is concerned, the main clauses of the offer are as follows: Employers shall have freedom to introduce systems of payment by results satisfactory to the men and employers concerned, subject to the following conditions : In all cases the time rate of the workman concerned shall be guaranteed irrespective of earnings.Overtime, night shift, Sunday and holiday allowances shall be paid in addition to earnings under any system of payment by result on the same conditions as already prevail in the trade and district in question for time work.The price to be paid, or the basis time to be allowed either for a new job, or an altered job shall be fixed by mutual agreement between the employer and the workmen who are to perform the work, or by such other methods as now exist, or may hereafter be established by agreement in any trade or district.No piece-work price, bonus or basis time, once fixed, may be altered unless thematerial, means, or method of production is changed. When the material, means, or method of production is changed, and the employerdesires a modification in price or basis time, the modification shall in no case be such as to effect a reduction in the earnings of the Avorkers concerned. Piece-work prices and bonus or basis times shall be such as will enable a workmanof average ability to earn at least 334 per cent, over present time rates(excluding war bonuses).With regard to the acceptance of this offer a difference of opinion manifested itself between the engineering unions and the general labour unions.The representatives of the former, after considering these terms, submitted counter-proposals designed to secure the right of collective bargaining on the fixation of piece-work prices. The employers insisted, however, that the unions should undertake to recommend their members to accept the clause &quot; that the employers shall have freedom to introduce systems of payment by results satisfactory to the men and the employers concerned.&quot; Further negotiation ensued, but it proved impossible to reach an agreement, and eventually the representatives of the engineering unions decided that the members of the unions should be consulted by ballot vote on the question of payment by results.So far as the general workers unions were concerned, however, a partial provisional agreement was secured. The representatives of these unions decided to recommend to their constituent bodies acceptance of the employers&apos; proposals, and it was agreed that a conference of the various unions affiliated to the National Federation of General Workers should be held to.consider this recommendation. This conference was held on the 18th March, and the following resolution wras passed : &quot; That this conference is of opinion that the question of payment by results with proper safeguards is worthy of the consideration of the trade unions affiliated to this Federation.&quot; The safeguards which the Federation has in view are, according to Mr. J. 0&apos;Grady, M.P., the following : (1) Where, by reason of the introduction of the 47-hour week, a workman is not able to earn on piece-work his previous remuneration on the same job, the em-ployer will undertake to recommend that suitable adjustments be made on. the piece-work price for that job.(2) That piece-work prices shall be such as will enable a workman of average ability to earn at least 33-g- per cent, over present time rates. Piece-work prices, once established, shall not be altered unless the methods of manufacture are changed.(3) Where prices are such that, on account of the reduction in hours, the workman of average ability is unable to earn 33-g- per cent, over present rates, the necessary adjustments shall be made.
The next stage in the negotiations, so far as the general workers&apos; unions are concerned, will be a further conference with the employers with a view to reaching an agreement as to the details of the scheme.The nine engineering unions concerned in the negotiations are taking common action in their ballot on this question. The ballot papers, which are to be returned by the 28th April, provide for a vote for or against empowering the representatives of the unions to negotiate with the employers in regard to payment by results. It is provided that if the vote proves to be in favour of negotiating, any joint recommendation arrived at is to be referred to the members for acceptance by a ballot vote.The desire of employers for a system of payment by results is natural enough;, but the extreme caution with which both the accredited representatives of the unions and the rank and file of their members proceed before committing themselves to the acceptance of payment by results may seem to require some explanation especially as this method of payment is firmly established in other industries. In the textile trades, shipbuilding, mining, the pottery trade, the boot and shoe industry, the clothing trades and others, the main wage system is that of payment by results. The system not only works well, but in many cases the employees would not tolerate any other.With regard to the present negotiations, there are three main points on wrhich the engineers oppose the offer of the employers. The employers insist that any firm which can agree upon a system of payment by results with its own workpeople shall be free to introduce it. The unions, on the other hand, are anxious that arrangements shall be made, or where they have been made shall continue to exist, for the effective establishment of collective bargaining. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers is eager to strengthen the hands of its District Committees in order that it may pursue its policy of extending the scope of district collective bargaining. It insists that over and above any agreement which may be arrived at in an individual shop the District Committee or some similar body should have a right to sanction the scheme or withhold sanction.The second point which the trade unions urge is that although the employers&apos; proposal that piece-work prices are to be such as to enable the workman of average ability to earn at least 33i per cent, over present time-rates seems generous, as 25 per cent, is the rate usually provided for, yet it is in reality unsatisfactory. The workpeople maintain that the 33^ per cent, price is illusory, for the percentage is granted not on the actual present time-rate but only on the standard time-rate exclusive of war-bonus. The employees, therefore, maintain that the question of the consolidation of wages must be settled before payment by results.^The employees have also expressed a more fundamental objection to the system of payment by results. The desire of the employers to see the adoption of pay-ment by results arises, of course, largely from the necessity of increasing production, particularly in view of the shorter hours that have been introduced into the engineering industry, which the workpeople are threatening action to reduce even further. Many of the workpeople, however, are fully conscious that, apart from the employers&apos; interests, this is a national necessity, and Mr. J. T. Brownlie, Chairman of the A.S.E., as also Mr. Tom Mann in his recent pamphlet, has been emphatic in his advocacy of increased production ; but the fear is expressed by the men that the result of speeding up production will be to create unemployment after the boom. Thus, a demand is being made by the workers that prior to the institution of schemes of payment by results the employers must undertake to accept responsibility for unemployment in the industry, and must adjust working hours so that virtually there will be no unemployment. The dread of unemployment is very strong, and the fear that increased production will lead to unemployment is probably the most important ground of objection to the adoption of systems of payment by results in the engineering industry. This fear is partly due to a theory but is partly based on ex-perience. If the workpeople could be guaranteed against the evils of occasional unem-ployment by the establishment of a liberal unemployment scheme for the industry, their opposition to payment by results on other grounds would, probably much more readily be overcome. And there seems no doubt that the adoption of payment by results throughout the engineering industry would lead to a great increase in production.* It will be observed that the unskilled men have put it forward as a condition of accepting payment by results that the 331 Per cen^- s^a^ f*e based upon &quot; present time-rates.&quot; The engineers&apos;opposition, to the employers&apos; proposal is partly due to the fact that they have been forced, against their will, to give precedence to the question of payment by results. They wished to discuss first the consolidation of wages,, which the employers&apos; proposal relegates to &quot; a special conference to be held at an early date.&quot;(c 1980) U2     ,
Beyond these objections being raised at present, however, there are one or two of a more general nature, and more obscure, but not less important. Mr. Tom Mann refers to them in his usual picturesque terms : &quot; Payjnent by results demoralises the man by encouraging the selfish side of his nature, it feeds his desire to get more at any cost to bodily health, it destroys good comradeship, it encourages a man to become utterly disregardant of his workmates, and feeds the avaricious and acquisitive side of his nature so that fine manhood is lost. . . . There is no need to recite instances to show that employers have encouraged the maximum output and then cut the rates, and that repeatedly in the most shameful fashion, the men in the trade know it too well, and it has been the chief cause in developing their hostility to the system.&quot; As to rate cutting, there is no doubt that it has been practised to a very wide extent, and the line between reasonable and unreasonable rate cutting is hard to draw. Men undoubtedly do fall into a new process after some experience and may be able to turn out double or treble the amount they did at first with the same expenditure of time and energj&apos;&apos;. A certain amount of rate cutting here may be reasonable, and an undertaking not to cut rates may lead to serious trouble with men in the same shop on time work, as happened during the war in the well-known case of the semi-skilled machinists and the skilled engineers. But to set a rate for a job and then attempt to cut it by changing some inessential detail and calling it a new job requiring a fresh rate is a different matter. Again the rank and file have very naturally an objection to working continually on the stretch. Men object to the feeling that if they stop for a moment to rest they are losing something, and there are undoubtedly a considerable number of temperaments upon which this feeling may in time produce undesirable psychological effects. Finally, as regards solidarity, and the feeding of the &quot; avaricious and acquisitive side &quot; of men&apos;s natures, it must be realised that here one touches one of the fundamental issues for the labour move-ment. The whole strength of Trade Unionism lies in every man feeling that he can, so to speak, only rise with the tide. The weakness of the clerical grades of workers until recently was due largely to the absence of this sense and the presence of its rival, the feeling of each man that he would outdo the rest and rise to the top by his own efforts. The Trade Union leader, often a man Avhose own success has come from the possession of this latter spirit, must always have regard to the strong feeling against it among his followers. Any serious attempt by employers to foster it such as is seen embodied in an elaborate policy in certain parts of America to-day, or such as is suspected of lying behind the introduction of payment by results, is bound to encounter his strong opposition.Part IT.-Departmental.The National Scheme for Disabled Ex-Service Men.The publication of the King&apos;s National Roll, giving particulars of the first 10,000 employers who have entered into an undertaking with the Ministry to employ disabled men in accordance with the terms of the National Scheme, will, it is hoped, assist consider-ably in promoting public interest in the progress of the scheme and bringing local opinion into play for its further development. The number of firms who have accepted the scheme continues to increase steadily, if rather slowly. On the 5th November, a little over 9,000 employers, with about a million and a quarter workpeople, had. accepted the scheme. The number of certificates issued up to the 24th March was, 13,300, and the total number of employees in the firms concerned exceeded 2,000,000, of whom over 121,000 are disabled men. . Many of these men, however, had been found work before the scheme was instituted, and it must be recognised that the number of men placed in employment under the scheme still falls markedly short of the 100,000 for whom it was hoped to find positions in addition to those already employed. The Exchange live registers of disabled men, constantly rein-forced by those passing out of hospital, are very appreciably lower than in September, 1919, when the scheme was launched, but the total still stands at a considerable figure. On the 8th August, 1919, a little over 40,000 disabled men were registered at the Exchanges. By the 12th March, 1920, in spite of the fact that the Exchanges had placed in employ-ment some four or five thousand, disabled men each month, the live register still stood at a little over 24,700. Recent reports indicate that the total is still falling, but the number of disabled men for whom the Ministry is responsible still remains, it will be seen, at a suffi-ciently high level.Steps have recently been taken to accelerate and render more extensive the canvass of employers which has steadily been carried on by Local Employment Committees and
Employment Exchange officials from the time when the scheme Was inaugurated. A special canvass is being undertaken of employers who have not given undertakings, and is to be completed by the 31st May. All firms employing 25 workers or more will be visited, except railway undertakings and firms engaged in coal mining, shipbuilding and engineering. It is hoped that a canvass of employers in the two industries last named, will shortly become possible. The canvass is to be carried out, so far as firms with over 100 employees are concerned, by members of the Local Employment Committees where these bodies feel that a better chance of sucecss will thus be afforded. All other firms coming under the canvass will be visited by the Exchange officials. It is hoped that the canvass, undertaken under the circumstances of publicity afforded by the issue of the King&apos;s Roll, will result in a much wider acceptance of the scheme ; and in any case the information acquired in the course of the canvass should be of considerable value in determining any further steps which may be necessary. Attention has recently been drawn once more to the question of including in Government contracts a clause similar in nature to the Fair Wages Clause, in order to insure that all firms holding, a Government contract comply with the scheme. Several local authorities have already introduced a similar system in connection with municipal contracts. The future development of the scheme in. general, including the possibility of some measure of compulsion, is being submitted by the Ministry to inquiry.Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press.Trades Union Congress.The principal topics of discussion in the papers reviewed this week are the events of the 11th and 12th March, the decision of the T.U.C. not to take industrial action in the form of a general strike to force nationalisation of the mines, and the decision of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to proceed immediately with a demand for an advance in wages. It cannot be said that the proceedings at the T.U.C. arouse any enthusiasm in these papers. Perhaps the only writer who expresses unequalified satisfaction at the decision of the Congress is &quot; Rob Roy &quot; in &quot; Forward.&quot; He thinks that the Congress rescued the miners from a difficult position and is pleased that &quot; the unfortunate chapter which opened at Glasgow in September &quot; has been closed. The LLP. writers approve the decision of. the Congress but nevertheless are criticial. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; and the &quot; Labour Pioneer &quot; both record disappointment at the formal nature of the Congress proceedings. They complain of the fact that the delegates to the Congress were so bound by their instructions that no live discussion, could occur an interesting commentary on the delegate system. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald both think it necessary to state that the decision of the Congress was no general condemnation of direct action under all circumstances. They . agree that direct action is an unsuitable method by which to secure mines nationalisation, but they insist that circumstances may occur where a general stoppage of work would be the most effective means of opposing the policy of the Government. Mr. Snowden&apos;s example of such a case is taken from foreign affairs. If a Government proposes to embark upon a war which was opposed by an overwhelming majority of the people, he thinks a general strike would be thoroughly justifiable. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald&apos;s example is taken from the state of affairs which might exist under a Labour Government.. Writing, perhaps, with the first news of the Berlin couv d&apos;etat before him, he thinks that a general ; strike might ultimately prove the only weapon by which the constitutional Government of a Labour Party might be preserved.Mr. William Stewart, in &quot; Forward,&quot; in seeking some ground by which he may approve the proceedings of the Congress, is tempted to emphasise the fact that, by its resolution, the Trades Union Congress has definitely entered upon a political campaign to secure a specific political object. He points out how the conservative forces in the trade union world were once opposed to the entry of trade unions into politics and goes so far as to use the fact that the T.U.C. resolution did not mention the Labour Party, as a proof of the progress that was made on Thursday the 11th March. The answer to Mr. Stewart is provided by the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; which bitterly complains that an opportunity was lost at the T.U.C. for a discussion upon the methods of political action. This paper thinks that the T.U.C., after having passed its resolution in favour of political action, should immediately have discussed and determined upon the details of the political campaign which . it pledged itself to pursue.  The Parliamentary Committee is urged to show energy and it
is argued that an energetic Trades Union Congress political campaign would do much to still the demand for direct action by providing the direct actionists with an outlet for their superfluous energy.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; though it obviously does not approve of the decision of the Congress, is perhaps more timid than the I.L;P. writers in its criticism. This paper is gratified that the Congress has at last been forced to face a clear issue and regards the fact that a card vote of over a million was secured in favour of direct action, as a great victory. Mr. Clynes&apos; speech is used to support a plea that the &quot; Communist Party&quot; &apos; if and when this Party does come into existence must make all preparations to lead the attack upon the &quot; coming Labour Government.&quot; This opinion of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought,&quot; that direct action is by no means dead, is shared by the &quot; Democrat,&quot; which urges the need for continued propaganda against the theory of direct action. Mr. W. Appleton, in the &quot; Democrat,&quot; and Mr. David Gilmour, in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; show a refreshing appreciation of practical points. Mr. Appleton points out how much the financial resources of the unions have been reduced by the ill-considered strikes of the last eighteen months and attributes to this factor some responsibility for the decision of the Congress. Mr. Gilmour expresses the opinion that the proceedings of the Congress mark the virtual destruction of the Triple Alliance.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Congress explains that the final chapter in the nationalisation struggle has by no means been reached. The bulk of this special article is devoted to persuading the consumer of the impossibility of allowing the present position to continue. &quot; There must be a combina-tion of public ownership with control by experts and manual workers in conjunction.&quot; The &quot; New Age &quot; attacks generally the supporters of political action at the Congress, but agrees that, in the present case, their policy Avas the correct one. This paper has no faith in the Sankey Report, but it trusts that direct action will be preserved for use upon a more appropriate occasion and suggests that such an occasion might be a protest against the high cost of living.The &quot; Socialist &quot; is the only paper which specifically connects the Congress discussion on direct action with the call for a general strike issued by the social-democrat members of the German. Government as a reply to the Berlin coup cVetat. The only deduction, how-ever, this paper makes is that a recourse to direct revolutionary action in this country is just as inevitable as it has been in Germany.Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.The decision of the miners to pursue a demand for increased wages meets with a somewhat mixed reception. Mr. Philip Snowden quotes Mr. Hodges&apos;s speech at the Trades Union Congress to show the futility of seeking wages advances as a method of obtaining compensation for the increased cost of living. He asserts that the miners themselves admit that, if they succeed, the price of coal, will be increased considerably. Mr. Philip Snowden, nevertheless, defends the miners&apos; claim on its own merits. He main-tains that the miners&apos; policy is the only method which organised labour can under present circumstances employ and that the reply of the Government to their demand should be to take practical steps to reduce the cost of living, namely, by reducing the national expendi-ture, deflating currency and credit, and taking measures to check private expenditure upon luxuries. The &quot; New Age &quot; is as critical of the new wages campaign as it has long been of the nationalisation campaign. This paper states that the miners&apos; leaders themselves know that the pursuit of high wages is an endless and futile race after prices. It is com-plained that Mr. Hodges has rejected on his own responsibility the plan of the &quot; New-Age,&quot; an alternative both to the policy of nationalisation and to the policy of wage strikes, which this paper claims to have put before Mr. Hodges some months ago, but the details of which have never been given to the public.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald has absorbed fully the remarks delivered by Mr. Hodges at the T.U.C. on the subject of the sacrifices the miners have already made for the general good and a great part of his weekly article to &quot; Forward &quot; is a recapitulation of Mr. Hodges&apos; remarks and a reproach to the general body of trade unionists for not acting like the miners. Mr. Hodges&apos; remarks are, however, taken up in the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; in a more critical spirit. This paper admits Mr. Hodges&apos; thesis that higher wages are no solution to the problem of higher prices, but it vigorously defends the cotton factory opera-tives against the charges which have been made upon them for being inert and passive. It is pointed out that the textile unions have had a more difficult problem to meet than the miners, and it is maintained that the difference between the miners and the textile workers lies only in the fact that the miners occupy a far stronger industrial position and have the industrial power to put their ideas into practice.  Mr. W. Appleton, in the &apos;; Democrat,&quot;
judges the policy of the miners from the same point of view as he judges the policy of the T.U.G. He points out that at present there are many miners employed in economically unprofitable mines. The desire of the M.F.G.B., he thinks, is to keep its present membership and therefore to secure such an alteration in the state of affairs as will admit the continued operation of unprofitable mines. Mi&apos;. Appleton opposes the wages claim as being sure to cause inflation.The Rank and File Conference.The Rank and File Conference which met before and after the Trades Union Congress does not receive much attention in the papers reviewed this week. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; gives an account of the proceedings, but the only critical reference is a remark in the London letter in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; The conference is criticised as being inadequate both in representation and in capacity, and on the ground that it was taken for granted by the delegates that a revolution could only come by armed force. The writer of this criticism believes that there is need for co-operation between those who hold the new revolutionary conception of trade unionism. A notable feature of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; in recent weeks has been a somewhat critical commentary upon the present unions, both craft and industrial. It would, however, appear that there is little sympathy between the rank and file movement as at present constituted and organised, and these &quot; Labour Leader &quot; critics of trade unions.The Labour Movement.The discussion upon the domestic problems of the more extreme Socialist bodies has subsided. The rumours that were current last week with regard to the fusion of the supporters of the present government into one political party are noticed in many papers, but the effect of such fusion on the political Labour movement is not canvassed. Last week a tendency was observed to look to foreign countries for light in these controversies. This practice is noticeable again this week. Mr. Philip Snowden, in. the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; refers to M. Branting&apos;s premiership in Sweden. He trusts that when the British Labour Party finds itself in a position similar to that of the Swedish Socialist Party it will resist the temptation to accept office without power. On the other hand, &quot; Rob Roy &quot; refers to Herr Bernstein&apos;s article in last week&apos;s &quot; New Statesman,&quot; to M. Branting&apos;s premiership, and to the success of the coalition government in Belgium, to show the positive advantages which may accrue from a combination of all socialist and democratic parties on a progressive programme of social reform in cases where the socialist party is not in a position to assume entire control of a Government.Government Policy.There is little criticism of Government policy in the papers reviewed this week. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; refers to the debate in the House of Commons on high prices on Monday, 15th inst. In a leading article, the opinions of this paper on the problem of high prices are again outlined. It is insisted that no one Government can bring about a substantial reduction in the cost of living, because the rise in prices is a world-wide phenomenon; and that profiteering is a result and not a cause of the prevailing high prices. In the opinion of this paper, the fundamental causes of the present high prices are Government borrowing, floating debt, diminished production and the impoverished condition of vast populations in Continental Europe.The Trade Union correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; makes some remarks upon Joint Industrial Councils. He claims that there is hardly one of these Councils from which any permanent good is likely to come to the workers. He insists that meetings between employers and workers should be restricted to the discussion of questions which are in dispute between the two sides. &quot; Except when matters of dispute such as wages and hours are under discussion, the J.I.C. provides just that atmosphere in which the labour leader is induced to drop the &apos; cant of class struggle.&apos; &quot; In his discussion of the attitude the Government is adopting towards Joint Councils in the Civil Services and Government Establishments, this contributor to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; shows that he has not followed closely the recent history of this class of Joint Councils. His hostility to Industrial Council is paralleled by an appreciation of Trade Boards. He regards them merely as permanent machinery for negotiation between employers and workpeople. He suggests that there is need for a Central Trade Board which will act towards the various sectional Trade Boards in the same way as the Agricultural Wages Board acts towards County Agricultural Wages Boards.
Foreign Affairs..The Berlin coup tfetat of the 12th and 13th inst. is noticed in many papers, but the articles on the subject are not remarkable for clarity, consistency or common sense. The writers of the articles possessed little information as to the course of events, and news of the later and, perhaps more interesting, developments of the coup (Vetat the action of the trade unions in prolonging the general strike in Berlin, the activity of the Independent Socialists and the general risings of communists-had not come to this country when these articles were written. &quot;The Call&quot; roundly declares that this coup d&apos;etat cannot be a counter-revolution, because the events of November, 1918, in Germany were no revolution, but merely a change in Government. &quot; The German workers have their battles still to fight.&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; hopes that out of the trouble another &quot; proletarian revolution &quot; will arise. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; adopts the theory, which was prevalent in January this year in the more extreme papers, that a definite policy exists whereby the Allies may be assisted by a reactionary Germany in a last attempt to crush Bolshevism. Mr. Norman Angell contributes an article to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; which is based upon the theory that &quot; the Allied Governments will do everything they can to make the wheel swing to the extreme right, in order to re-establish the militarist caste and nationalist creed of Prussia.&quot; With Mr. AngelFs extreme suspicion of France may be contrasted remarks by Mr. Robert Blatchford, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; urging that France has been ungenerously treated and that the French point of view should be more adequately presented to the people of this country. Mr. Philip Snowclen deals, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; with the &quot; de-claration on the economic problems of the world &quot; approved by the Supreme Allied Council on the 8th inst. He adopts the views expressed by the &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; New Statesman &quot; last week on this matter, and, like them, proceeds to make an attack upon the French Government. He rejoices in the growing estrangement, which he believes to exist, between the French Government and the other Allied Powers.Part IV. General Topics.The General Situation.The Labour situation is again dominated by difficulties with regard to wages in the coal mining industry and on the railways. On the miners&apos; demands for an advance of 3s.. per shift for adults and Is. Qd. per shift for junior workers negotiations are still proceeding. The application of the A.S.L.E. &amp; F. for an advance on the standard rates granted in August last is at present being considered by the Railway Wages Board, and discussion is also taking place on the question of the adjustment of wages in accordance with the sliding scale agreement recently reached between the Government and the N.U.R. There is also unrest on the London Electric Railways owing to the delay in applying to these railways the advantages under the national settlement, and a strike of Lancashire and Yorkshire railwaymen at Wakefielcl has taken place owing to grievances against the control system and the one-day suspension of a driver. The various demands of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for increased wages for dockers, omnibus and tramway workers, and commercial road transport workers are still under consideration. Thus, it is noteworthy that there is at present unrest and dissatisfaction of an acute kind in all the industries associated in the Triple Alliance. Although nothing has been heard of that organisation for a long time, it should not be forgotten that by an agreement reached at its last meeting on the 27th November it was provided that a meeting of the Alliance should be called in the event of any of the associated unions failing to obtain their demands.So far as industrial disputes involving a stoppage of work are concerned a feature of the week has been the large number of settlements reached. Among these may be men-tioned the settlement of the strike of Dundee plumbers, of the lock-out of electricians in Liverpool, and of the Knutsford building trade strike. It is expected that an agreement regarding increases of wages will be reached in the tobacco and boot and shoe trades without a stoppage, as negotiations so far have proceeded satisfactorily.The Unemployment Position.The reduction in the number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged, for the week ended the 12th March was 11,561 compared with a reduction of 15,478 between the 27th February and the 5th March. The number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged at ,the 12th March was 262,662 by men and 3,443 by women, making a total of 266,105.
93,844 unemployment books remained lodged on the 12th March, a figure which shows an increase of 807 since the 5th March. The total of 93,844 was composed of 65,196 books lodged by males and 28,648 by females compared with 65,130 by males and 27,907 by females for the previous week.At the 5th March, 621 policies remained lodged by short time workers of which 535 were in the insured industries (chiefly engineering and ironfounding) and 86 in the uninsured. At the week ended the 27th February, 1.920, there were 979 short time policies remaining lodged.At the 12th March, the employment exchange live registers showed 340,195 men&apos;, 54,069 women and 20,758 juveniles compared with. 351,108 men, 52,907 women and 21,232 juveniles for the previous week and 416,892 men, 51,791 women and 24,590 juveniles a month ago.jMiners.A delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, attended by 162 delegates from all the coalfields and 19 officials, was held on the 24th March, to receive the report of the Executive on the negotiations which had been proceeding with the Govern-ment on the miners&apos; demand for an advance in wages of 3s. per shift for adult and Is. Qd. per shift for junior workers. After discussion, the following resolution was passed unanimously : &quot; That this conference has heard the offer of the Government of an advance of Is. Qd. per shift for all adults, and Qd. per shift for all under 16, who are colliery Avorkers in coal mines or at the pithead of coal mines and whose wages have hitherto been regulated by the movements of wages of colliery workers, or, alternatively, 20 per cent, increase upon the gross wages, excluding the war wage, and the Sankey wage, to date as and from 1st April, 1920.&quot; We inform the Coal Controller that we cannot accept the offer, and must press for our full claim of 3s. per shift and Is. 6d. for boys, to commence from 1st March.&quot;It was decided that the conference should adjourn till the 25th March, when a form of ballot-paper would be submitted by the Executive for approval. It was also agreed that the Government should be informed of the decision of the conference and their willingness to meet the Government to hear any further communication it might desire to make. In the afternoon, after a meeting of the Executive, Mr. Frank Hodges stated that, in consequence of the Prime Ministers reply, the Executive would report to the conference that the ballot vote must proceed. At the meeting of this conference an invitation was received from the Prime Minister to a further conference at DoAvning Street, and the Executive complied.   The Miners&apos; Conference in the meantime adjourned.A special conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation was held at Cardiff on the 22nd March to discuss the wages question, and a resolution was carried that they should press for an increase of  2 a week in South Wales. In view of the fact that the Miners&quot; Federation of Great Britain was actually negotiating for a smaller amount, a further resolution was passed recommending that the negotiations should proceed, but that if the amount claimed were secured, notice would be given to the M.F.G.B. that &quot; South Wales will propose that the Federation press for the decontrol of the mining industry, and an application be made at once for a further increase in wages for the South Wales district.&quot;This decision is noteworthy on two grounds. In the first place, it is an indication of the determination of the South Wales miners to secure a large increase in wages, in order to share in the large profits being made in the coal export trade and to obtain wages on a level with those now being earned in the South Wales tinplate and iron and. steel traces. In the second place, it bears further evidence to their increasing dissatisfaction with what they regard as the undue moderation of the M.F.G.B., and it is quite possible that they may decide to break away from it altogether. Such action would be a severe blow to the aim which the M.F.G.B. have been pursuing with marked success, the policy of organising all workers in and around the mines on a national basis.The Nationalisation of the railways.A conference organised by the executive committee of the Railway Nationalisation Society was held on the 20th March. Mr. A. E. Davies presided, and representatives of six trade unions and a number of co-operative societies attended. A resolution was carried affirming the opinion of the Society that the most efficient system of transport could only be achieved by State ownership and operation of the railways. Mr. J. Bromley, Amalgamated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and Mr. A. G. Walkden,(C1980) X
Bail way Clerks Association, moved and seconded a resolution expressing the conviction that no national system of transport would be successful unless the utmost use were made of the goodwill and knowledge of the workers engaged in the various undertakings com-prising such a system, and this could only be secured by the workers taking a direct share in the management and control of the transport system by means of representatives nominated by them upon the national and local boards of management in the manner prescribed by the Railway Nationalisation Society&apos;s draft Bill. This resolution was also carried unanimously.The Nationalisation of Shipping.In connection with the ballot that is at present being taken by the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union on the question of the nationalisation of the shipping industry, Mr. J. IT. Borlase, Liverpool, in a circular to members of the union, explains the case for nationalisation. He maintains that nationalisation would mean the security of the public from monopolists, the more efficient and economic working of ships and the provision of better quarters for the crew, better food, better wages and continuity of service. Mr. Havelock Wilson, M.P., General President of the Union, has issued a manifesto asking members to vote against nationalisation. He casts doubt upon the alleged advantages that the sailor would get from State control. The sailor, he suggests, would not get more wages and the State could not run the ships as economically as they are run at present. He claims that there is nothing on board a ship pertaining to a seaman&apos;s life that it is not possible to regulate by the power of combining : &quot; We can base our wages, accommoda-tion, food, hours of labour and many other things on an International basis by combining strongly in an International Seamen&apos;s Federation.&quot; In this connection, it may be noted that at the first annual general meeting of the Seafarers&apos; Joint Council held in Liverpool on 19th March, an international programme prepared by the Council was announced. This programme is as follows : (1) International minimum wage; (2) international load line; (3) international prohibition or limitation of deckloads; (4) international life-saving apparatus; (5) international manning scale (including nationality); (6) international standard of accommodation on board ship ; (7) international hours of labour at sea and in port and a standard number of days to the month; (8) international standard of victualling and serving of food ; (9) right of seamen to portions of wages earned and standing to their credit when in a foreign port; (10) payment of wages to commence from the date of signing articles and to terminate on day crew are paid off ; (11) wages to continue in case of shipwreck until crew arrive home ; (12) international standard of compensation for loss of life, accident and loss of effects ; (13) compulsory pilotage ; (14) recon--struction of wireless maritime telegraph service; and (15) National Joint Maritime Industrial Councils and an International Joint Maritime Industrial Council.Furniture Trade Guild.It is reported that officials of various unions of furniture trade workers are favourable to the idea of a proposal for the formation of a Furniture Trade Guild.  The idea, like that of the Building Guild, emanates from Manchester, and it is suggested that a scheme for the institution of a Furnishing Guild will probably be brought forward as soon as. the Building Guild has been completely established.Trade Union Finance.The financial difficulties in which trade unions find themselves owing to a variety of causes are being aggravated by the number of claims upon them owing to the contributions which they are required to make to various organisations and to the necessity of sending delegates to the increasing number of conferences that are being held. With regard to the first matter, the extraordinary growth of trades and labour councils and local labour parties during the past few years is causing an increasing drain on the funds of local branches of unions. The financial practice of unions towards such bodies is not uniform.. Some unions have paid from the central union funds the sums due from branches affiliated to the trades councils and local labour parties. Others have undertaken no such responsibility and the branches themselves have had to pay the subscriptions. An instance of the difficulty that is being felt by unions is given by the recommendation of the National Union of General Workers that the total contribution from any one branch of the union.
Amalgamation. .A ballot is being taken by the Sheet Metal Workers on the question of amalgamating all their societies into one national union. The Southampton Branch of the Friendly Society of Ironfounders has requested the National Council to take an immediate vote on the question of amalgamating with the engineering unions. Swansea Pianoforte Tuners and Repairers have decided to amalgamate with the Furnishing Trades Association. The proposed amalgamation of the Amalgamated Society of Pharmacists, Drug and. Chemical Workers and the National Association of Chemists Assistants was provisionally approved at the annual meeting of the former society and a, ballot of the members is to be taken.Trade Union Topics.South Wales and Monmouthshire Colliery Examiners&apos;Association. At the annual meeting of this Association the President stated, with regard to their relative ons with the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain that if they made an alliance with that Federation or reached a common understanding their joint board with the coalowners would cease to exist. He deprecated the tendency which was manifesting itself on the part of some of the lodges to fraternise with the miners and cut themselves adrift from the management of the collieries.Scottish Associatio?i of Net and Line Fishermen. A meeting of fishermen held on the 18th March at Aberdeen unanimously agreed that a Scottish union of fishermen should be formed under the above title. It was agreed to recommend the fixing of a close time for herring fishing on the East Coast of Scotland up to the 14th June. It was also decided to petition the Government to extend the three-mile limit against trawlers. A meeting of fishermen held at Campbelltown, Argyllshire, on the 17th March, decided to form a local union of fishermen mainly apparently with the object of obtaining minimum prices for the; summer herring.The Building Trade.Much interest is being taken in the ballot of building trades operatives on the question whether overtime shall be worked on the building of houses. Over half a. million voting papers have been issued to members of the National Federation of&apos; Building Trade Operatives, and a memorandum accompanied each pa,per setting forth the reasons why the leaders of the Federation advise the operatives to vote for overtime.. Mr. Bradshaw, Secretary of the Federation, has expressed his confidence that the men will respond to the appeal though it will involve big sacrifices as it means working five or six hours more at the ordinary rates instead of the usual overtime payment of time and a-half. He expresses, the hope that the &quot; other side will share in the sacrifice by selling material at a low cost for housing schemes.&quot;With regard to the statements which are frequently made by building trade operatives that large numbers of bricklayers have left the industry for more remunerative occupa-tions, it may be noted that in July, 1914, the unemployment insurance books current held by bricklayers numbered 79,497, and in January, 1920, these numbers had fallen to-58,962, a difference of 20,535. A small part of these 20,000 were no doubt in the Army and a considerable part would be represented by a normal reduction due to mortality, etc. On the other hand there must have been a certain amount of, recruitment, though no-doubt it was small, of bricklayers between 1914 and 1920. The net result of these different influences seems to indicate that a considerable number of bricklayers have left this trade, but the exact number cannot be ascertained.(C 1980) X 2to a trade and labour council should not exceed  8 per annum. This amount, it should be pointed out, is much below the amount which many branches would be due to pay on the present basis. The great increase in the number of trade union and other conferences also involves heavy expenditure for the unions. In this connection it may be noted that a conference called by the National Federation of General Workers will be held on the 30th March at which the attitude of the affiliated unions towards the Joint Industrial Council Scheme will be considered. The unions apparently find that this scheme entails considerable expense and this matter is to be discussed at the conference.
The International Labour Office.The Governing Body of the International Labour Office which was elected at the International Labour Conference at Washington met for the first time in London on the 22nd March.  The delegates were as follows : Government representatives : M. Arthur Fontaine (France), Sir Malcolm Delevingne (Great Britain), Baron Mayor des Planches (Italy), Dr. Hermann Rufenacht (Switzerland), M. Francsizek Sokal (Poland), Mr. F. A. Acland (Canada), Vicomte de Eza (Spain), M. E. Mahaim (Belgium), M. S. Neumann (Denmark-), M. de Alvear (Argentina), M. Nagaoka (Japan), and Dr. Leymann (Germany).Employers&apos; representatives : M. Louis Guerin&apos;(France), Sir Allan Smith, M.P. (Great Britain), M. F. Hodacz (Czecho-Slovakia), M. Jules Lecocq (Belgium), Dr. Dietrich Schindler (Switzerland), and Signor R. Osculati (Italy).Workers&apos; representatives : M. Leon Jouhaux (France), Mr. G. H. Stuart-Bunning (Great Britain), M. J. Oudegeest (Netherlands), M. A. Herman Lindqvist (Sweden), and Mr. Tom Moore (Canada).The Director, M. Albert Thomas, spoke of the need for the immediate creation of a health section of the Office. The Washington Conference had adopted a number of recommendation-mendations dealing with industrial hygiene which it was intended should be taken up by the International Labour Office. The Secretariat of the League of Nations were also pro-posing to set up a health, department which would deal with matters of health from an industrial standpoint. The question therefore arose as to the relation between the Labour Office and the Health Department. Sir Allan Smith expressed the view that the Labour Office was clearly concerned with industrial hygiene, but it would have w co-operate with the Health Department of the League and any overlapping must be avoided. M. Guerin agreed and M. Jouhaux said that there could be no doubt that the International Labour Office was the right body to study industrial Irygiene. Sir Malcolm Delevingne and Mr. Stuart-Bunning supported this view. The Director said that if all were agreed that the Labour Office should have a section to deal wth industrial health, all that was needed was to work out a scheme to co-operate with the League-On the 23rd March a discussion took place on the arrangements for the Seamen&apos;s Con-ference at Genoa in June. It was decided to suggest that a standing committee consisting of five representatives of shipowners, five of seamen, and two of the Governing Body should be set up. This committee will be associated with the technical maritime section of the International Labour Office.International Transport Workers Congress.The International Conference of Transport Workers was held in Christiania on the 15th-20th March, in order to decide upon the new constitution for the resuscitated Trans-port Workers&apos; International. This conference was the result of long negotiation. The British representatives included Mr. J. H. Thomas, Mr. Gosling, Mr. Robert Williams, and Mr. E. Bevin. The constitution which was adopted by the Congress supports joint national and international action as circumstances may warrant in the struggle against exploitation of labour and promises moral and financial support to organisations engaged in industrial disputes by promoting and supporting sympathetic strikes, passive resistance and boycotts. All trade unions engaged in the transport trade and in state or municipal traffic undertakings are entitled to affiliation to the International Transport Federation. In the event of a strike, boycott, or lock-out being contemplated, the executive of the particular organisation shall render an account as to the course of the struggle to the Committee of Management. The Committee of Management shall proclaim a boycott of the means of transport only as a weapon to be used in extreme emergency and after a complete account of the circumstances has been given, by the national affiliated organisa-tions. When the unions of one country desire support from unions in other countries they shall request both the unions of the particular industry and of the International Transport Federation.On the important question of the situation of the headquarters of the Federation no final decision was reached. On the former matter the Congress voted by 1,268,926 to 870,000 in favour of Amsterdam and not London as the headquarters of the Federation, but a protest against this decision was made by Mr. Robert Williams on the ground that it had been obtained by the voting strength of the German delegation which claimed to represent 550,000 members, whereas only 192,000 members were paid for last year.
Eventually a compromise was reached, and it was agreed that until July, 1921, when the Congress will meet at Geneva the headquarters will be Amsterdam. The matter will be finally settled at Geneva, and only membership on which subscriptions have been paid will count in the voting. Mr. J. H. Thomas and Mr. Robert Williams were elected British delegates to the Bureau.  M. Fimmen (Holland) was re-elected Secretary.D. J. SHACKLETON,Secretary.All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to : Intelligence Division,Ministry of Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London. S.W. 1.
