H; isurtax under Clause 23 - xroposed Amendment. (^norandum b^Mr, Long).Objection has been raised by representatives of the Southern Unionists to the provision in Clause 23 of the Government of Ireland Bill, which empowers the Irish Parliaments to impose a surtax on individuals resident in Ireland.     It is feared that it would expose a limited number of individuals with property in both Great Britain and Ireland to taxation on the whole of their incomes, merely because they maintain a residence in Ireland, even though their primary residence and possibly far the greater part of their property were in Great Britain.iir. Bonar Lav; received a deputation and promised to adopt an amendment to guard against this danger, and the matter has been submitted to the Irish Sub-Committee on Finance.     The bubt-Committee have been advised that the remedy indicated by iir. Bonar Law, viz,, the limitation of the surtax to that part of an Irish residents income which is derived fiom Ireland, would l^ad to administrative difficulties.     The Department administering the surtax (whether an Irish Bejiartmeat or the Imperial Inland Revenue) would find gr.at difficulty in distinguishing what,part of the profits of a business carried on in both countries is attributable to Ireland.     The proposal would also be open to criticism on the grounds that (i) it is a materially greater limitation on the taxing power than is imposed on the states of America or the Provinces of Canada; (ii) that it would make the surtax an instiument of discrimination against the investment of capital in Ireland; (iii)that(TPflfr DOOUI^Ul&apos; IS rX&apos;iiE IMPLhffY OF HIa BftilaiLIQ IvIA.JKoTY15 GOVBBHMCIIT. 1 g fi G h E T.cabinet.be, t.

that it would be inequitable as between individual Irian residentsThe bub-Committee are&apos; of opinion that the remedy desired by the Irish Unionists oan be effectively secured, and all these difficulties avoided, by an amendment which requires domicile as well as residence as the distinguishing character-istic ttf the individuals to whom the surtax 01 relief under Clause 23 should apply,     This will exclude alike from the burden of the surtax and from the advantage of the relief those whose parents have been   ordinarily resident in Great Britain and who have done notniag themselves to make Ireland their primary country of redolence.     It will, in fact, limit the operation of the Clause to those who are real Irishmen as distinguished from those who happen to possess a residence in Ireland.It was also thought desirable to make it clear that the Bill would not empower the Irish parliaments to impose a capital levy.The Parliamentary Draftsman has been instructed t* prepare amendments in accordance with the above decisions.W.H. lorn. 7th March, 1920.
