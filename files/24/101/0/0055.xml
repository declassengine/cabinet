[184192]EXPORT OF BRITISH COAL TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.1. I DESIRE to call the attention of my colleagues in the Cabinet to the serious position in regard to coal supplies which faces not only Italy, Switzerland, Greece and Portugal, but also Egypt, a British Protectorate.2. As an example of the representations received from the Governments of those countries, the annexed telegram from His&apos;Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Egypt, and also a note from the Greek Prime Minister, are circulated herewith.3. Owing to the introduction on the 1st January last of a system of modified coal control, which involved the abandonment of the allocation of fixed quantities of coal for export to individual countries, and established a free market in the exportable surplus, these countries have been forced to compete in the open market with other coal-importing countries for a share of the rapidly diminishing quantities of coal available for export.- 4. At the same time the indefinite power vested in the coal authorities to refuse the export of particular consignments on the ground of the insufficiency of the home supplies, deprives the buyers on foreign account of any certainty that they are actually obtaining the coal they have purchased.5. The result has been that, owing to the inability of these countries to obtain coal sufficient to meet their minimum requirements, they have appealed for assistance to the competent Departments of His Majestys Government, who, in consequence of our present coal policy, have been unable to intervene.6. I need not emphasise the political consequences which may well follow if countries like Egypt and Italy, not to mention others, are allowed to remain unaided to face their present coal situation. In Italy, where our recent reports indicate a steady growth in the power of the Socialist parties, the internal situation is full of anxiety. Railways and other public utility works are run on the narrowest margin, and the forces of disorder may easily get the upper hand if something is not done to strengthen the hands of the Government.7. While it may not be possible to increase materially our coal exports in the near future owing to urgent home requirements, I submit on urgent political grounds that a Committee, to be attended by representatives of the Board of Trade, Coal Mines Department, Ministry of Shipping and the Foreign Office should be set up at once with instructions to report whether, without altering our general policy, some scheme cannot be devised whereby those countries suffering from acute coal shortage would be assured of supplies proportionate to their minimum requirements and proportionate to the amount of coal available for export at any given time.8. The advantages of such a system would be twofold : (a.) Instead of the absolute uncertainty now prevailing and the consequent general scramble for any supplies in the market each foreign country would be able to rely on a definite monthly minimum ration.(6.) Foreign shippers and coal importers being, assured of cargoes of definite volume would send the necessary tonnage to load the coal allotted at the proper time, thus relieving the present serious congestion at the ports of loading, where hundreds of foreign vessels are lying idle in the hope of obtaining coal cargoes.C. or K.March 24,1920.6   [2726]
Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby to Earl Curzon. (No. 230.   Very Urgent.)(Telegraphic.)  R Cairo, March 9, 1920.SIB A. WEBB has telegraphed to the Minister of Communications to the effect that difficulties are being experienced as regards export of coal to Egypt.This raises serious problem here. Supplies from America which should amount to 18,000 tons a month are held up owing to American embargo on export of coal, and there is at present only about three months&apos; supply of coal in the country for railways and two and a half for [? other] public services. Even if ttteps are taken to despatch fresh supplies [? inside] stocks will have run very low by the time these supplies will arrive. If they are not despatched at once it would be necessary to reduce all transport services.I need not emphasise the serious effect which this would produce in the present delicate political situation, and I trust every effort will be made to facilitate supplies reaching us.Amounts consumed monthly are 33,000 to 34,000 tons for railways and 18,000 tons for other purposes.Please telegraph as soon as possible what action can be taken. I should at the same time be glad if War Office can be pressed to supply Palestine Military Bailway regularly with coal without interfering with Egyptian State Bailway stocks.M. Veniselos to Earl Curzon.My Lord, .   The llitz Hotel, London, March 8, 1920.1 HAVE the honour to bring under your kind consideration that, as you are very probably already aware, the situation arising in Greece because of the shortage of coal is very serious, almost critical.1 have therefore the honour to earnestly request your Lordship to be kind enough to use your valuable influence to the proper authorities to the purpose to help the Greek -  Government in their difficult task in obtaining a proportionally small quantity of coal, absolutely necessary for the working of some of the most important needs for social activity and, I dare say, for social life.I will only mention to your Lordship the requirements of coal for the use of the railways and for the production of gas. These two services being of general public importance for Greece they are under direct Government control.From your Lordship&apos;s correspondence with the Greek Legation in London, and especially your last letter of the 31st January, 1920, reference No. 174327/C and T (G), I understand that &quot;it is not, in piesent circumstances, possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to intervene for the benefit of individual importers or shippers &quot; ; and in the second paragraph of the same letter it is stated &quot; I have the honour to suggest that the best source of information concerning the present or future position of coal exports to Greece would be a firm of coal exporters in close touch with the market.&quot;With reference particularly to this letter I have the honour to bring to your Lordship&apos;s knowledge that it is not a question of individual importers or shippers, as the Greek Government itself wants this coal for the purposes stated above ; and, furthermore, I have the honour to state that the delegate for coal for the Greek Government in England is in touch with firms of coal exporters regarding the purchase of coal, but that the difficulty in obtaining coal for Greece comes Irom the Coal Controller, who finds difficulty in granting the necessary export licences.Your Lordship may be assured that 1 am quite aware of the difficult situation of coal at present, and that, if I have the honour to trouble again your Lordship on this matter, it is only because the quantities considered as absolutely essential for Greece are, as I had the honour to state above, quite small proportionately; that is to say, the Greek Government brings the minimum of the required coal to the amount of only 3,000 tons monthly for gas production, and at about 20,000 tons monthly for the other purposes.Considering, my Lord, that these quantities, which will fill the most urgent needs &quot; of Greece, if granted, will not make any inconvenience to Great Britain. I have the honour to request your kindness in this matter, trusting that your Lordship will not refuse his assistance.I have, &amp;c.E. K. VENISELOS.
