The miners,^ having rejected the Government offer of la. 6d. a shift, are taking a * ballot on the question of striking.   In most of the mining areas a two-thirds majority will probably be obtained.   It does not follow either that the ballot&apos;voting is to be trusted or that a strike must necessarily take place, but it is well to make all preparations.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; publishes to-day a very mischievous article stating that the Government has made plans for blockading mining villages.   This statement will do immense harm unless it is contradictedThe extremists in this country are full of hope that Germany will become a Communist State.  Meanwhile, Miss Sylvia Pankhurst has launched what she calls &quot;Social Soviets&quot; and hopes to permeate women in their homes with revolutionary doctrines.It now seems unlikely that there will be a rising in Ireland, with a sympathetic outbreak in this oountry, on April 5th.The railwaymen, who are working to &quot;Rule Book&quot;, have greatly dislooated traffic at Crewe *Doubts are expressed whether the May Day Celebrations are likely to bo a suooess.Mr. lansbury bad a warm welcome at the Albert Hall on Sunday, but he disappointed bis audience by admitting that there had been outrages in Russia.   He indignantly denied that he had received money or paper from the Soviet Government, a oharge which had not been made.   It Is, however, perfectly true that the Soviet Government instructed their agent in Stockholm to give him 500 tons of paper, the present value of which is about  25,000.
THE COAX MIRERSThe Executive of tho Minors&apos; Federation is following its admitted policy of forcing tho nationalisation issue by making such demands for Increased wages that tho owners will &quot;be glad to accept nationalisation in preference to bankruptcy.   The Government offer of Is. 6d. a shift - an offer which will make an increase in the Wages Bill of over twenty-ore million - was rejected yesterday and a ballot is to be..taken.It is too early as yet to estimate how the voting will go, but past experience has shown that tho extremists are adept at the manipulation of votes and it may bo assumed that more than two-thirds majority will be obtained, certainly in South Wales and possibly in the other coal areas as well.   The West Yorkshire miners are the least inolined towards a strike.   The South Wales coalfield is practically solid for it; indeed on March 21st a Delegates f &apos; - Conference in that field outdid tho federation Executive - by demanding an additional    a week instead of 3s. a &quot;shift, and if the Government had granted the 2s. they intended to strike for the higher advance.   The leader of this mov^mant is A.J* Cook, who was present at the Hank ani 3?ile Convention at the time of the Trade Union Congress.It is not yet certain, even when the ballot in favour of a strike is declared, that a strike will take place, but we must be prepared to face, the probability that there will be a siriko about three weeks hence.Tho v&apos;j)ai?,7 Herald&quot; of to-day has a very mischievous article entitled &quot;Government Plot to Blockade Mining Villages&quot;. It claims to be baaed on &quot;sure authorityVtrade/
- z -trade unions and co-operativesThe movement for solidarity between the Trade Unions a the Co-operatives, whioh began just after the railway strik last September, is proceeding and it is certain to become a factor in any strike of the miners,   W.T.A. Foot, the secre of the London Council of the National Union of Railwayman, now published his scheme in pamphlet form.   It provides for strike pay of 24s. a week, which is to be paid in goocte rathe than in money, on a system of vouchers which are to be honoul by the local Co-operative Store.   The scheme pre-supposes th the Trade Unions will pledge themselves to give financial support to the Co-oporative Movement and that every Trade Unionist in the country will become a Co-operator.   Trade Union funds are to be withdrawn from capitalistic concerns and invested in tho Go-operative Movsmsrrt.In practice, however, there seems to have been an illustration of the reluctance of the British worker to baci his convictions with his money; the organ of the Co-opsrati?j Wholesale Society states that the recent issue of bonds &quot;waal. not snapped up iwith. tho avidity pictured by enthusiastic Co-operators and Trade Unionists.&quot;   There has, however, beenj a great increase in the turnover of the organisation.   The increase in sales shown by the Scottish Board for the last half year of 1919 amounted to  8,939,00.6* 18. 3, or 29.1$ and the value of the goods produced during 1919 was  7,413,135. 2. 2. or 31.3$ more than in 1918.The movement is growing rapidly in South Wales. The Cardiff Co-operative Society has now a membership of over 7,000 - an Increase of 2,300^during the last nine months. In the same period the capital has increased 72$.TEE/
2 91)m   JJ  mTHE IMPENDENT LABOUR PARTYThe rift in the ranks of the Independent Labour Party has been accentuated by the preparations for the Annual Conference in Glasgow on April 3rd.   Suklatvala has been distributing the &quot;Rank and Pile Appeal&quot; entitled &quot;The Call of the Third International&quot;.   Tne chief business of the coming Conference will be the question of definitely Joining the Moscow International, and there is likely to be a good deal of recrimination.FEELDiG AMONG EX-SERVICE MENReports from Woolwich are now a little better, and the prospect of an armed march to Whitehall has receded.The National Union of Ex-Service Men continues its campaign for back pay, and the formation of new brsnch.es is continually reported.   The Union does not admit men serving with the forces but invites them to report their complaints and it is claimed that it has some supporters in the Navy.The Coventry branches of the National Federation, which are non-political, are suffering from lack of funds.PROPAGANDA IN THE LONDON DOCKSThe Workers1 Social Federation has announced an Easter week oampaign &quot;with a view to turning the transport workers ^ed1, for on them will depend the success or failure of the revolution when it comes.&quot;   It is, however, short of speakers, and is appealing for additional help at street corner meetings.A DEBATE ON BOLSHEVISMOn March 22nd at the Kingsway Hall, Sir Bernard Pares and William Gallacher debated the proposition, &quot;That the Soviet system is impracticable as a form of democratic&apos;Government&quot;/
M      A     KMGovernment.&quot;   Tho majority of tho audienoe appeared to belong to the British Socialist Party and formed a claque for Gallaoher.   The debate, as a whole, was ineffective beoause neither speaker really grappled with his opponent.MB. LANSBURYMr. lansbury received en enthusiastic ovation at the Albert Hall on Sunday.   He opened his speech with a vigorous denial of the report that tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; had roooived 500 tons of paper from the Soviet Government.   His denial was not quite ingenuous; it is true that he ha3 as yet received no paper but it is equally true that the Soviet Government has instructed its Stockholm agent to purchase 500 tons of paper and supply it to Mr, Lansbury free of charge.   These instructions were sent after a discussion as to whether the paper would not be a cheaper form of subsidy than money.   It is possible that the publicity given to this may cause the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; to decline the proffered subsidy for fear that it cannot be kept secret.MB. &quot;HMDSiaSOiPS MISSIONThe Soviet Government is becoming nervous about &quot;the admission to Russia of persons who may not see eye to eye with them,   Even Mr. Hendersons mission is suspected and&apos; they would like Mr. Smillis, Mr. Robert Williams and Miss Sylvia Pankhurst to aoaompacy him.Mr. Robert Williams,who never misses a chance of self-advertisement,, proposed and carried a motion at the Internation Transport Workers1 federation masting in favour of admitting representatives of the Industrial Workers of the World.   Ho also carried a resolution condemning the &quot;White Terror&quot; in Hungary and &quot;celling upon the Bureau to take action if it is not ended.&quot;Mr. Smillie cannot be altogether pleased with hisspolpgists/
Ml    ft    Mlapologists. The ourrent issue of tho &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; (Miss Pankhursfs paper) ascribes his resignation to disgust with the &quot;baseness of his colleagues.MAY DAY OgjMRAHOgSTom Mann and some of the other tebour leaders are beginning to doubt whether the May Day Celebrations will bea success.   In the current issue of the Amalgamated society of Engineers&apos; Monthly Report, Mann writes:-wWe cannot authorise at the present staga a general holiday, but it behoves all to participate in May Day In right hearty fashion; as the writer views the situation, NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH MAY BAY CELEBRATION IS TO BE DISLOYAL TO THE CAUSE OF LABOUR.&quot;This is not likely to impress working men such as one who was overheard to say to his mates the other day that he was &quot;not such a damned fool as to give up a day!s work to get blisters on his feet to walk to Hyde Bark and back.&quot;Meanwhile, it is hoped to arrange a football match at the Chelsea Ground as a counter-attraction, it being the last day of the football season.THE &quot;SOCIAL SOVIET&quot;wnwwwi.....I.....i, urn......mm 11(111Miss Sylvia Bankhurst!s Communist activities are to be devoted now to the formation of what she calls &quot;Social Soviets&quot;. According to a memorandum recently issued and signed by J. Thurgood, it appears that the Workers1 Committees and Shop Stewards&apos; Organisations are to look after the men industrially in the workshop, while Miss Sylvia Pankhurst is to organise revolutionists socially where they live.   Part of the business of the &quot;Sooial Soviet&quot; is to capture women in their homes, to collect information as to food supply and transport and to propagate the Soviet idea in every possible way.   These Sovietswill/
will be transformed into branches of the Communist Party as soon as it is formed.   The watchword is to be &quot;Quality not Quantity&quot;.   The memorandum goes on to say that the Scottish comrades hare already Soviet Committees working in many areas, and it is hoped that they will link up with the &quot;Social Soviets&quot; in England.   The first step is to get together a group of comrades who are sympathetic, and to ertend it by canvassing the local labour and socialist organisations.   If the local Secretary is likely to be victimised for his or her activities, the personnel is to be immediately changed.   There is, of course the usual appeal for funds, and that is the rock on which the &quot;Social Soviet&quot; is likely to split unless it secures foreign money.SINK FEIN IS GREAT BRITAINCorrespondents in Lancashire have been making special enquiries -about- a possible Sinn Fein rising at Easter.   They all agree that thoiigh trouble is to&apos;be expected in Ireland before long, Sinn Feiners in thi3 country realise that they, would gain nothing by disturbances.   Moreover, the publicity, recently given to the date, April 6th, will probably lead the Sinn Feiners in Ireland to postpone the date as they count upon surprise tactics.   Rumours of a rising on April 5th have subsided in Glasgow, and the hotheads have been told that if. they want to- fight they must go to Ireland. It is true that Sean McLoughlin has been talking wildly of the growing, strength of the &quot;Red Guard&quot;, but little attention need be paid to this. .The Sinn Esiners in London are scrutinising the would-be recruits very closely.   The London District Council claims that the Irish Self-Determination League has doubled its membership since the last quarterly meeting, and has now 21 branches in London.   It has been hinted that during the Easterweek/
xa    Y    M*week an attack may &quot;be made on prisons in which Sinn Seiners aro detained.Mr. William Soars. Sinn 3?oin M.P., has been active on the Tynesido during the week.   Ho addressed meetings att tGateshead and Jarrow and,has attempted to strengthen theposition of the local Irish Labour Party.At a meeting&apos; addressed by Captain Redmond, M.P., onMarch 16th at St. Helens, a resolution condemning the action*of the Irish Government was passed; it was worded in the usual extravagant terms.XREMH)There wa3 no improvement to observe In the state of the country during the past week,   It is impossible yet to give an accurate estimate of the number of putrages reported, but as far as appears, at present there were about fifty, the great proportion coming from the Province of Minister which has always been one of the v/orst areas,   Only three cases have been reported from Ulster, and two of these are cases of intimidation by the Sinn 3?ein Party in County Cavan. Leinster remained fairly quiet during the week, though there was one serious case of holding up the mails between Dublin and Navan.   There are, however, strong indications that the Irish Republican Army leaders will attempt a more drastic campaign early,in April, and it would appear that the decrease in the., number of outrages may be partly theifresult of their preoccupation with the organisation of the outbreak.   This would still leave those&apos; members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood who are responsible for the shooting of tho police free to act.      &apos; -Though a general rising on the.5th April now seems to be unlikely, there may be a campaign consisting of simultaneous attacks on military and police barracks, andpossibly/
possibly attempts to kidnap prominent Government officials. It would appear that the Sinn Fein Executive were very much surprised at some of tho information contained in the papers found recently in the- stolen mail bags, and that they are, as a result, still more concerned with the leakage of information from their circles,There was a large number of raids for arms during the week.   The campaign of murder, intimidation and robbery continues but there appears to be no new development in its programme at present.The Sinn Feiners have been suggesting that the murder of the Lord Mayor of Cork was carried out by policemen in disguise.   Enquiries seem to show that this was impossible; it is far more likely that Alderman MaoCurtain was killed because some letter intercepted in one of the captured mail vans or some unguarded statement seemed to show that he did not approve of secret murder and they feared that he might give some of the Sinn Fein 3eorets away,   Recent events have shown that they now take no risks, but shoot even their own supporters on suspicion.&quot;Old Ireland&quot;, the principal Sinn Fein weekly paper, appeared as usual, and draws attention to the necessity of preparing for the elections in June next: &quot;The local Government machinery in Ireland is of vital importance to Republicanism,   We must control it.   The January elections were good, but could have been better.   The Juno elections must be distinctly better,&quot;   This paper also contains a dangerous artiole entitled &quot;The Southern Unionists&quot; by R*S. 0!IIegarty:   &quot;If the people of this country arose in their wrath and scourged the Southern Unionists with every weapon that the evil heart of man hath devised they would only be just, for these people are traitors and the sons of traitors and shameless and unrepentant to boot.&quot;   Itreprints/
M      9     **&quot;reprints a mischievous article from the English &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot;, with which it is very pleased, drawing an exaggerated picture of the terror and distrust aroused by Sinn Fein in official, circles, and also contains an advertisement of the new &quot;National Land Bank Ltd.&quot; the directors of which are scarcely calculated to inspire confidence in persons with money to invest.   Mr, Erskine Childers is one of them.The anniversary of St, Patrick^ Day passed off quietly in the North of Ireland, where some sixteen meetings and demonstrations were held under the auspices cf the Ancient Order of Hibernians.   None of them were very large nor were the speakers or the speeches of any importance.The Governments Home Rule proposals still arouse little interest and no one seems to take the Bill seriously or to care what becomes of it.   The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have made no pronouncement on the subject, nor is it to be expected that it would have much effect on Sinn Fein if they did.   They are more concerned with the Education Bill.The land oampaign with which the leaders are seeking to popularise the Sinn Fein movement in the East Riding of Galway is still in progress and is causing grave anxiety to landowners, who are expected to surrender their properties for next to nothing and to be limited to 100 acres in future.   This campaign is purely Bolshevist and may spread.There are no strikes of any particular importance in progress in the Provinces at present, and the Irish Transport and General WorkersT Union is not noticeably active.   No Labour speeches of a revolutionary or inflammatory nature have been recently delivered nor has any literature of this nature oome under notioe.A Glasgow correspondent states that a Sinn Feiner was
overheard to say at a friend1s house in Glasgow whore he was holiday-keeping that everything Is arranged in detail for an immediate rising if such should be determined upon. Plans have been perfected and tho Dublin Customs House wil not be neglected on this occasion.It is reported that ammunition and arms are being imported into Ireland as passengers1 luggage via Holyhead and Dublin, also that a number of trawlers fishing in the vicinity of the Irish Coast were carrying the above.My Liverpool correspondent reports that there is a movement on foot amongst the Sinn Feiners in Ireland to find out traitors like the Lord Mayor of Cork and these when found will share the same fate.
