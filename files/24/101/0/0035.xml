Mi nut e 51 (1) ,Copy of 1 ett e r from the &quot;Mini s t er __of_.Tr a transport to the SecretaryH om e *A ft a i r s&apos; C bmmi tie c.Ministry of Transport,, 2, Whitehall Gardens,23rd March, 1920.Dear Sir,The Memorandum by the Ministry of Food circulated as a Cabinet paper, C.P. 838, and dated 11th March, 1920 in its third paragraph may be read to imply that a consideration in deciding upon the policy to be pursued in connection with imported meat in cold store may be the inability of the railways of the country to move the meat.In order that the Home Affairs Committee may not unjustified-fiably take a decision in this matter, I wish to say that the railways could undoubtedly, if required, provide insulated rolling stock capable of dealing with an additional thousand tons of meat per day.The handling of meat is a question of insulated wagons mainly.   Fifteen hunt, red (1,500) of these were specially insu-lated at the request of the Ministry of Food during the War,-but at the present time they are bein^ used for general traffic. A small number of wagons like this could easily be diverted to the carriage of meat if it were con si cored desirable by the Cabinet.
11 appears fro\i: 111,e document that thc difIiculty of the Departments concerned is not so much to distribute meat, as to increase the consumption of mutton?   Actually large consign-ments of beef from the plate arc being delivered and the ships are being turned round satisfactorily*   Beef is being brought to London ex ship at Liverpool, at the same time that Australian mutton is held up in ships in London.If the market can be induced, either by reduction of price, or some other means,  to take increased quantities of frozen mutton, I see no reason to doubt that arrangements can be mace for the necessary railway transport up to the amount I have named or even move, if it were necessary.The Memorandum of the Ministry of Food in that respect is not concurred in by the Ministry of Transport.Your      ithfully,(Sgd.) ERIC G-TDD^S.The secretary,Home Affairs committee of the cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens,^ W    &quot;1 ; .
