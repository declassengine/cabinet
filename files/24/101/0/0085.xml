%a 2)From Viceroy, 12th March 1920. (Received 26th, 10 a.m.)290 S. Your telegram of 2nd. March. Afghanistan. Military questions mentioned are being separately examined. We cannot agree in views which, you appear to hold with regard to situation vis-a-vis Afghanistan. It is impossible to forecast with accuracy what an ignorant State like Afghanistan may do, but we do not believe there is likelihood of any immediate breach with us on the part of the Amir. Latter naturally attempts to make the best of his case and employs arguments and expressions in his letters which he cannot really expect us to accept, while he will try up to the last moment to bluff us with the bogies of a Bolshevist alliance and tribal unrest. Moreover his officers, such as Nadir Khan, often exceed his instructions. In any case we could- not contemplate a policy of military operations ag;ainst Afghanistan, cost of which would fall entirely on the&apos; Indian Exchequer, unless we are pushed into it by fresh acts of Afghan aggression against India. Position that conference is purely preliminary will, as you desire, be made plain. To lay down hard-and-fast lines for the conference would defeat its main object, which is to encourage frank and. untrammelled discussion of attitude of two Governments and would be particularly unwise in view of unlooked for developments which usually characterise discussions with Afghans. General line on which we shall instruct our representatives to proceed is to&apos; impress firmly and temperately upon the Afghan delegates both our own sincere desire to befriend and help Afghanistan and respect her independence and the difficulties which she has by her recent conduct placed in the way of our maintaining such friendly attitude. &apos; They will attempt, to discover what it is that the Afghans really want from us, to explain what we really want from them, and to check and, if possible, lay to rest any absurd and extravagant (? pretensions) of Afghanistan which may be advanced. Regarding Bolshevists we shall not demand complete cessation of relations (although all our information now points to disagreement between them and Afghans) but shall explain and insist on reasonableness of our demand that Bolshevists shall not by Afghan aid be put in a position to disturb India. Regarding frontier tribes, we shall impress upon the Afghans the impossibility of our yielding to the claim which they seem likely to make and necessity for their using any influence which they may possess over the tribes in favour of peace. If conference is to cfo any good we must probably be in a position to indicate what we might ultimately be prepared to grant in return for really friendly attitude. We have already at your request mentioned in my telegram of 11th January, No. 29 C, matters on which Afghans may.possibly seek for concessions in the event of negotiations for a friendship treaty taking place. On some of these points we shall probably address you further before the conference. On the others we would defer addressing you until development of discussions show that they might be mentioned with advantage. As one of the objects of the conference is to tide us over critical period of next hot weather, there will be no disadvantage in any delay (? through) references to you. Afghan delegates can now hardly arrive before April, and climate of Lucknow will not be suitable for discussion protracted. Only hill station where accommodation can be secured is Mussoorie&apos;, and Amir is being informed that conference will take place there.
