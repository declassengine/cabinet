ma(This Document is the Pro pert His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovtrntECfiETCABINET.BILL OF INB1INITY AM) STATUS OF LIMITATIONS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.441.2.3.(Reference 0.?. 845).. While I am in general agreement with the proposals embodied in the draft Bill, the following points seem to call for attention,Under Clause 2 (2) (i) of the Bill it is provided that &quot;where under the Defence of the Realm Regulations,&apos; or any order made thereunder, any special principle for assessment of compensation or the rate thereof, is contained in the regulation or order, compensation shall be assessed in accordance with that principle or rate&quot;.     This provision intimately concerns the Board of Trade in connection with the assessment under Regulation 2. B. of compensation for flax requisitioned under the Flax (Irish Crop) Order and also&quot; in some outstanding1 cases at least s6 far as relates to Timber.    The validity of Regulation 2.B. is challenged in the Courts, and should the principles of assessment contained in it be finally decided to be invalid they could probably not be applied by the Defence of the Realm \losses) Commission under &quot;the terns of Clause 2 (2) (i) of the Indemnity Bill.    It is true that the  War Emergency L&apos; ws Continuance) Bill now before Parliament provides that the Regulations to be continued (which include Regulation. 2.B) shall have effect as if enacted in that Bill, but it also provides that no regulation as continued shall have greater validity than it had before the time when but for the Warfergencv Laws (Continuance) Bill it would have expired-suggest that farther consideration be given to this point with&quot;a view to making the principles of compensation laid down in Regulation 2.B. applicable in any event and absolutely valid, subject to any saving&apos;- if thougnt necessary  of claims in pending proceedings.exporThe right of the Privy Council to issue licences for t in derogation from the Prohibitions of Export has been recently questioned in the House of Commons,&apos;   The validity of Export Prohibitions is not challenged, but the power to grant licences thereunder is. , The Licences have&quot;&apos;since February. 1915 been issued (in the nnmo of the Privy Council) first by the War Trade Department and.latterly by the Board of Trade.;   Admittedly there is no statutory authority for licencing;&apos; but the power has been exercised, by the Privy Council certainly since the 18th cenfeyv It is also to be noted that the practice of issuing licences where export is prohibited is&quot;&quot; expresslv recognised ]by Section&apos;4 of the&quot; Customs (War Powers) let 1915.    It is, however;&apos; a matter for consideration whether, having Regard to clause 4 of the  Bill validating inner t Licences issued by the Board of Trade, a similar clause might not witjfi advantage be inserted in the Bill validating alLL-iceitcesfor/ Y
for exDorts granted by or under the authority or purported authority of the Privy Council; so as to set the points once and for all at rsst.I wish to draw attention to the extreme importance of Proviso [iii) of Clause 2 (i) which provides that &quot;nothing in this Section shall be construed as conferring on any person a right to&quot; compensation in any case where; in accord-ance with the principles on which the tribunal has hitherto acted;&apos; he would not nave been awarded any compensation&quot;. I. regard the retention of this proviso as of &quot;the utmost importance in barring out new claims under Clause 2 (i) (a) and (b); and think that it is  essential that the rovisions of these two last mentioned sub clauses should e strictly limited by this proviso; as otherwise, the door will be opened -to a flood of claims which it is intended to exclude,B. S. Home,27th March; 1920.
