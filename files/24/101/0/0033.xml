SOUTH RUSSIA./0^krj&apos;^$&amp;&apos; Admiralty Lfomorandum to the Cabinet.I circulate two telegrams that have been received from the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean regarding the present position in South Russia.It is evident from the information available that General Denikin will be forced to retire to the Crimea; and a decision I! by the Cabinet is urgently required upon the policy to be ; pursued by the British Navy and the orders to be sent to the Commander-in-Chief.It has already been decided -(a) to withdraw the British Military Mission:(b) to evacuate women and children from ITovorossisk under the terms of Sir H. Mackinder!s guarantee:(c) To supply fuel to Russian ships to assist in evacuation and to the mills in the Crimea to ensure the supply of flour to the population.The existing orders to the British Fleet are, that Denikin is to be supported from the sea, but that men are not to be landed.There are two alternative courses:First.-   to inform General Denikin that all British support is withdrawn.In this case it is probable that the Bolsheviks will overrun the Crimea; this will lead to excesses in the Crimean ports, and to further requests for British assistance in evacuating refugees.Secondly,-     to inform General Denikih that such support as is possible will be given by the British jtfavy acting from the sea, with a view to enabling him to hold the Crimea and&quot;to&quot;&quot;come to terms with the&apos; Soviet^ Government.In the opinion of the Admiralty, the latter alternative is the preferable one.     I recommend that Denikin should be urged to come to term with the Soviet authorities, and informed that the&apos;support of the British Navy is solely to enable him to exact satisfactory conditions whilst still in possession of the Crimea.     These terms would, I presume, include guarantees for the personal safety of women and  &apos; children, and the remnants Of the Volunteer Army.(Intlld)     WYH.L,22,3,20.
Copy of Telegram0From... C. in C. MecL Afloatvia W/T Rinella Cleethorpes.To Admiralty. Date..... 18.3.20.962 Z.      Owing to converging advances of Red and Green Armies from Horth and South respectively existence of Volunteer Army in Caucasus has entered on final phase.     It is useless and undesirable for Denikin attempt remain Caucasus. ?(He should) withdraw Crimea which easily tenable by 15 to 20 thousand men with adequate artillery.     Danger to Crimea less on front than in rear, where scandals and inefficiency of Schilling .regime have disheartened and demoralised army and civilian population. Under trusted and decent leadership Crimean peasantry would readily co-operate.Continuation follows in my 963Z. 1552/17.From..... C. in C. lied, Afloat.via W/T Rinella Cleethorpes.To.......Admiralty.     Date.... 19,3.30.963 Z.     Continuation of my 962 Z. (begins)Schilling&apos;s communications to Admiral Hope indicate clearly   that he has in mind the evacuation of civilian refugees as well as his own Array, instead of the retention of the Crimea.     I have therefore directed Admiral Hope to inform General Schilling that after the unnecessary evacuation of Odessa and the forced evacuation of Novorossisk now proceeding it is impossible for. us to provide ships or find asylum for refugees from Crimea and that under no circumstances will British ship3 be sent to take away an array which is under no military compulsion to leave. The above views are also being communicated to Rear Admiral 2nd in Command who will inform Denikin personally.1643/17.k
