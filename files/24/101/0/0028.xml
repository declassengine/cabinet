AITITEX IRESTORATION OF PROPERTY REGISTERS BY TU.-:IJSH GOVERNMENT TO GREEK&apos;&apos;GOVERNMENT*COPY    of letter from M* . Venizeloa- to Jir-yjJuXoyd George10th March, 1921,At the time of the evacuation of Macedonia by the Turkish Authorities in 1912, several Turkish officials carried off with thorn or destroyed tho property regis-ters which served the purposes of Land Registration.The disappearance of these, registers makes it im-possible to check in any way the titles produced by the owners and results in complete dislocation of tho public services concerned^     In particular, it paralyses tho efforts of the Authorities t-i establish a land register and to fix the boundaries between neighbouring villages,In these circumstances it is essential that the Turkish Government should be required,, by a clause ad hoc inserted in the treaty,, to restore-the registers in question to the Greek Government.   In the event of these registers having disappeared, the Greek Government should be authorised by the treaty to make copies in the Central Land Registry at Constantinople of the entries corresponding to the local registers of which it has been, deprived through the&apos; fault &quot;of the.Turkish AuthoritiesuTo this end,It ,Venizelos would bo grateful to the Supreme Council if it would sanction the insertion in the treaty of an article of the following tenor:-&quot;Article   ,,,., 0&quot;The Turkish Government undertakes to restore &quot;to the Greek Government the local land registers
&quot;or any other public registers relating to landed &quot;property in&quot; the districts of the Turkish Empire &quot;coded to Greece since 1912, which the Turkish &quot;Authorities removed, or may have removed at the &quot;time of the evacuation.&quot;In oases where the restitution of one or more of such &quot;registers, is impossible owing to their disappearance &quot;or for any other reason, and whenever necessary for &quot;purposes of verification of titles produced to the &quot;Greek Authorities, the Greek Government shall be ^entitled to take copies of the entries in question &quot;in the Central Land Registry at Constantinople.&quot;(Sd)   E.K.

Venizelos, in his letter to . r Lloyd George of March 10th., raised the question of the property registers relatine: to districts evacuated by the Turks,    He proposed the insertion in the Treaty of an Article of which he gave a draft (A..J.-80)Mr VANBITTAET observed that a clause had already been proposed, which might be extended to meet the desires of H. Venizelos.LORD CURZON said that he thought there would be no harm in doing so.Li. KAMMLRFR said that he thought there would be no objection, but the point raised two small questions. The first was, Should the Treaty deal with matters anterior to the War;   the second was, Should the Article suggested deal exclusively with Greek claims?   Would it not be better, he asked, to make it. of general application, so that it might cover the case of Armenia as well?THE MARQUIS IXPERIALI said that, in his opinion, the\Article ought to be in general terms.It was agreedThat Article 3 of the Draft Articles approved at the last Meeting (I.CP,-76, Appendix l) should be re-drafted in such a way as to cover the demands of IC Veni-zelos regarding property registers for territories ceded to Greece since 1912, the Article, however, should be re-drafted in general terms by the Drafting Committee,to ration PROPERTY ministers EY KISH GOV-MENT TO :K.
