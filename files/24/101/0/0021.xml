HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-) SECRET.I    -    . BUILDING- OP RAILWAY STOCK AT VtOOLftICKMEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.^A&amp;Ji think the time has arrived when the whole questionvall u j^y&quot;^&quot;^^ifiould be considered.    My colleagues will remember that the building of locomotives and wagons at Woolwich was undertaken after Cabinet consideration mainly from the point of view of finding work and thus avoiding a large amount of unemployment at the Arsenal.    The Minister of Labour and the Minister of Munitions both supported the scheme from the social and political aspect.    The work which is being undertaken is the building of 100 locomotives and 2500 railway wagons.Dealing first with the locomotives.     I desire to point out that no orders have as yet been received for the same from.any Railway Company, and that the Companies had previously safeguarded themselves in the course of the discussion by intimating that if they were subsequently asked to purchase and agreed to do so, they would net be prepared to accept the engines at more than the cost at which they could have produced them themselves.The suggestion, has been made by the Minister of Munitions -that if difficulty is experienced in placing the locomotives v/hen completed they shall be added to the Government Pool and allocated by the Minister of Transport amongst the different Railway Companies,.    I desire to point out that I have no right to compel Companies to buy stock which they do not desire to purchase.     The engines being, built are of South Eastern and Chatham Railway type.    The price and date of delivery are Important factors and both uncertain.- The Companies &quot;have also safeguarded themselves by declining to undertake to accept any new stock which wouldhave/
have the effect of dislocating their own arrangements for keeping their shops and staff employed.As to railway wagons.-   My colleagues will be aware of the controversy which a&apos;rose with reference to the building of these wagons and which led to representatives of the wagon Building Industry waiting upon the Leader of the House and pressing for an investigation of the Woolwich cost as compared with the cost in their own private shops.     Incidentally I may add that the fact that wagons were being produced there has been the subject of adverse comment and caused some difficulty to the Minister of Labour with reference to the men employed in the Wagon Building trade.I am advised that if it is desired to continue the policy of using Woolwich Factories for the building of railway stock a complete examination of the premises and plant and possible market should be undertaken and that that would result in proving the necessity for large capital expenditure in order to bring the equipment to a state -which would enable such stock to be built economically and in fair competition with other forms of production, and possibly for some additional expenditure on management.I am anxious to have a substantial increase In the facilities for producing railway stock which the country needs at the present time, but I am- of opinion that such facilities can be provided more economically&apos;and.efficiently by an extension of the shops which the Railway Companies have attached to their own business or by private enterprise.I desire to make it clear to my colleagues that I have not accepted any individual responsibility for placing of orders for locomotives or for the present system of building at Woolwich or for the disposal of the locomotives produced.     The wagon orders are placed by Railway Companies which will presumably take them at the contract price, -although I understand the output is seriously behind hand.20.3.20,   .
