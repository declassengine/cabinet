CABINET.INTOXICATING LIQ.U0R (REGULATION) BILL *tote fry the Chancellor of the exchequer, covering a Memorandum &quot;By the Board of customs and Excise.I circulate to the Cabinet a note which I have received from the Board of customs and i^xcise in regard to the effect which the proposals contained in the Intoxicating Liquor Regulation Bill would have upon the revenue.(Intld.)   A.C.Treasury, s.W.22nd March, 1920.
Memorandum by the l Board of Customs andnB^olae^The effect of the proposed increased levy on the receipts from excise must, as regards the beer and spirit duties, be a matter of conjecture, and no estimate of any possible loss of revenue from these duties could safely be given.   The loan w-ruld not, it is thought, be anything like proportionate to the red&quot;.ic-tion of licences and would be affeoted by the distribution of the houses closedoA reduction by 25$ in licences within a short period would be lolloped o,y some falling off in the consumption of liquor?, but a part of the loss in consumption might eventually be restored. A total reduction by 42$ as suggested in the Memorandum mr.st, it is believed, so diminish the facilities for obtaining liquor for consumption en the premises as to cause a permanent falling cffin the consumption.There would be in addition a direct loss of revenue derivedfrom excise liquor licences, but the annual amount of the loss would depend upon whether the licences selee\ed for extinction were in respect of the larger or the smaller houses.   An average figure for this loss might be put at  700,000.,The increase of the compensation levy to five times the present maximum levy would almost certainly provoke an outcry, particularly in regard to some, of the smaller houses, e*g. those of an annual value of  40 and under    100.   Taking for example a public house of an annual value of  50, the maximum levy is - 15.   To raise the levy to  78 *vould mean to increase it from 30$ of the rental value to 150$ of that value.   The licence-holder is entitled at present to deduct from his^rent a propor-tion of the levy varying with the unexpired term of his tenancy, subject to a maximum deduction of one-half of the rent, and thus the effect of the suggested increased levy would not stop with licence-holders but would reach many landlords in the form of a considerably reduced rents
20th March, 1920.It is not improbable that such an Increased&apos; levy would be X&amp;a&amp;e- th&amp;&apos; ^ound :or claiming a reduction of annual values forrates and taxes (including Income Tax and House Duty) and. so bring into force reduced values for the purpose of charging licence   -duty and compensation levy, and thus not only involve loss to the &quot;Exchequer but also to the Compensation Fund.,The cases of hovels and restaurants should also be mentioned. These pay a reduced licence duty based on the ratio of the liquor receipts to the total receipts and also a reduced levy.   These are classes of houses whose licences are hardly likely to be exiin-gcLished, and though they would not therefore derive any benefit from the Compenrat:- on tod their contributions &apos; to it would be qrirtupled,.   It might be argued that they would gain increased trade Ir liquor owing tc the suppression of licences of other houses.   This might or might not be the case.   It would depend upon particular circumstances.   But any very material Increase in * their Liquor receipts would most probably deprive them of the oon-cession of reduced licence duties.It may be added; as regards Part III, with reference to the powers proposed to be conferred upon the Commission to fix prices, gravitiesj and strengths, that the jurisdiction of the Commission would be confined to England and Y/ales,     It would seem necessary.,therefore, to confer upon some other body or bodies co-ordinatet.powers of control an Scotland and Ireland.. * s u o
