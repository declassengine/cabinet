^ His     :an:i:: ..&apos;--&apos;--&apos;,^/3J(P 233A 1 From Viceroy, 15fli March 1920. -7^ I (Received 24th, 10 a.m.)^o,v%0O S. Your telegram of 5th March. Afghanistan. Proposed communique Regarding conversations.   We consider it essential that nothing shall be publishedof which Bolshevists might take advantage in their negotiations with Afghanistan. . They appear to be now exceedingly suspicious of Afghan intention to desert to our --side, and too much plain speaking in public regarding our complaints againstAfghanistan and restricted purpose of approaching conference might undeceive themand arrest development of friction between them and Afghans. . On this view we propose the following communique : &quot; (R.) One of the terras of the treaty of peace signed with Afghanistan on .8th August last was that (? should the) Afghans prove by their acts and conduct that they were sincerely anxious to regain its friendship of the British Government, the latter would be prepared to receive another Afghan mission after six months for discussion and settlement of matters of common interest to the two Governments and re-establishment of old friendship on a satisfactory basis.&quot;Since then the course of subordinate politics has been obscure. Although the few communications received from Kabul have been friendly in tone there has been little proof in fact of any real wish on the part of the Afghan Government to cultivate our friendship. The Amir made the first conformation by putting forward a proposal for a conference of British and Afghanistan officials on the border to settle frontier affairs, but this proposal could not, in the circumstances, be accepted. The Amir Avas, however, told in reply that the British Government were prepared to permit a discussion between representatives of the two Governments with the limited object of clearing away misunderstandings, of frankly examining any obstacles which may now lie in the way of good relations and of preparing a firm foundation on which a treaty of friendship can be erected at a later date. The Amir, has welcomed the idea of such a discussion, and conversations with this object are about to take place at Mussoorie- between representatives of the Government of India and of the Afghan Government. These conversations will be purely preliminary and informal and will not have as their aim the immediate conclusion of a definite treaty of friendship.-one:MR. C. LGMGH
