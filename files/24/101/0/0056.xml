reports received there appears little or no probability of Russian goods being available for exchange in any large quantities j   The harvest in the Ukraine was reported to be a bumper one and large stocks have accumulated,, but, owing to the chaotic state of the railways, there is no way of transporting this stock other than by river and this latter is only available when ice disappears (, and is at its best slow and. laborious *Repatriation of British and Russian Nationals.The first batch of British prisoners and civilians arrived at Terijoki on the Finnish frontier on 10th Kercho S      &quot;Tagus&quot;, after discharging her second batch of Russian prisoners of war ex-Denmark at Libau, is to be diverted to Hango for British prisoners of war etco,   She will then return to Southamptone   S .S . &quot;Dongola&quot; sailed from Devonport on 16th instant, for Hango to embark the remainder of British nationals..PetchengaoFinnish aspirations to this arctic port have been recently revived, and political intrigue to attain this object has recommence do     Finland naturally desires this port, together with the area fed by the River Pasvik, in order to develop her timber trades   Scandinavia in general, and Norway in particular, oppose the claim - the latter country hoping to extend her frontier in the same direction.Esthonia*The remnants of the late Russian North-west Army are still being subjected to unnecessary hardship owing to the unsatisfactory attitude of the Esthonian Government.   Hospital and sanitary arrangements and feeding and clothing of these unfortunate refugees is being undertaken by the American Relief Association and American Red Cross.   Arrangements are being made for the transfer of 1000 Officers and men to Germany by means of Hamburg-America Liner from Stettin*   Negotiations are proceeding between Holvi.

The British Iviission at Narva has now been formally closed downo General Laidoner has tendered his resignation as commander in-Chief of the Esthonian Army, and it is foreshadowed that it will be acceptedj Generals Soots or Tonnisen being mentioned as likely successors *Baltic States Peace Situation*It is reported that pourparlers between Finland and Poland have resulted in agreement for both states to act together in making peace with Soviet Russia6   Reports received from Moscow indicate that the Bolsheviks are anxious for peace, and the internal situation is most grave owing to the entire dislocation of all transport for food supply.   Meanwhile the Baltic States Conference at Warsaw continues to deliberate, the trend of deliberations being to follow the lead given by the Allies in dealing with the Bolsheviks.   The new Finnish Government, which is decidedly Right, is, under the influence of General Mannerheim, not disposed to make peace.   The internal situation in Finland, together with the Allied attitude, will,- it is considered, be too strong for the Government, and Finland will have to follow Poland in peace overtures.   It is inferred that the Poles think it useless, owing to present strained relations, to Invite Lithuania to send representatives to the Warsaw Conference *Russian/
The plans for summer training in 1920 for the Swedish Navy consist of a cruise of four armed vesi&apos; els to foreign harbours, Lubeck, Amsterdam and Dartmouth are suggested.

JARNAN, will be carried cut.MEDITERRANEAN AND BLACK SEA.The Allies entered into, formal military occupation of Constantinople on the 16th March without opposition;   Part of the Naval detachments were withdrawn the same night at the request of the MilitaryoThe arrangements appeared to come as a surprise, but the peaceful nature of the occupation was mainly attributable to the display of force in every direction^About 3000 officers and men were landed from the Fleet?   Battleships and Destroyers were disposed so as to domin-ate Pera, Stambul and. Scutari a   Destroyers and Dloops were station-ed at Trebizond, Samsun, Ismid, Mudania, Panderma, Gallipoli and ChanaksAll precautions for possible further eventualities are being takene   The population   is reported to be quiet and orderlyo   About 25 persons were arrested and placed under guard In a Sloop?   They will be sent to MaltaoThe Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean has been instructed to send an officer to Athens to act as liaison officer in connection with the establishment of a camp for Russian refugees near that city9The Admiralty concur with the Foreign Office proposals to commence the destruction of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles fortifications immediately.   General Milne does not think the time has yet come for this to be done, but does not think It will affect the situation one way or another, and therefore raises no objections *Rumania demands the neutralisation of the Dardanelles under the control of a Commission similar to that of the Danube. Her point of view is virtually the ,same as that of France regarding the Dardanelles *general Denikiivs position *The general situation is most critical.      The Bolsheviks are expected, to occupy Ekaterinodar, and the evacuation of the Kuban by the remnants of the Volunteer Army      must follow.    Arrangements are being made to endeavour to ensureRug s ian Red J&amp;vyThe personnel have always been looked upon as an important military reserve, and were designated for use on shore in critical situations, such as Yudenitclrs march on Petrograd. This state of affairs, together with the unseamanlike instincts of the Russian, has allowed the material to be more or less entirely neglected, with the result that only a small unit of the former Russian fleet remains effectivec   Steps, however, have been tak n to remedy this and it is reported that energetic measures are under way to prepare the Baltic and Caspian Squad-rons for sea by the Spring.Sweden*
e   tf-uj after the safe withdrawal of the British MilitaryMissions, General Denikin88 personal safety % The situation as reported by the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, is as follows&quot;The existence of the Volunteer Army in the Caucasus has entered on final phase owing to the converging advance of Red and Green Armies from the North and South, respectivelyo ,It is useless and undesirable for&apos; Denikin to attempt to remain in the Caucasus,, (?he should) withdraw to the Crimea, which is easily tenable by fifteen to twenty then sand men supplied with adequate artillery*    The danger to the Crimea is less on the front than in the rear, where the scandals and inefficiency of the Schilling regime have disheartened and demoralised the army and civilian population     Under trusted and decent leadership the Crimean peasantry would readily co-operate?   Schilling1s communications to Admiral Hope clearly indicate that he has in mind the evacuation of civilian refugees a3 well as his own army, instead of retention of the Crimeao     I have therefore directed Admiral Hope that he is to inform General Schilling that after the unnecessary evacuation of Odessa and the   forced evacuation of Novorossisk now proceeding,, it is impossible for us to provide ships or find asylum for refugees from the Crimea and that under no circumstances will British ships be sent to take away an army which is under no military compulsion to leaves   The above views are also being communicated to Rear-Admiral Snd in Command, who will Inform Denikin personallye&quot;The Green Armies referred to are principally mutineers of the former Volunteer Army.    Their policy is one of self-preservation tinged with a sti ong anti-Bolshevik antipathy.   It is considered that these Green Guards will be in a position to put up sufficient resistance to Bolsheviks to ensure good terms at least for their capitulation.British Missions with Denikin are concentrated at Novorossisk&apos;, wTEE3ne exception of Colonel Row lands on and a small group, which have been ordered to Novorossisk via Baku5 Tiflis and Bat cumo   It is believed that British personnel with the Ural Cossacks are safe and may be expected to reach Novorossisk via Baku oRefugees aThe evacuation of refugees under the Mackinder guarantee continuesfrom Novorossisk.   The Greek Government have consented to house 800 Russian sick and wounded at Salonika,   a; :All families in Ekaterinedar and Novorossisk covered by the guarantee have been given a chance of going*   We have evacuated- besides, 2,900 sick and wounded, -5j.800 familieso   Large numbers have refused to sail without their men*   By arrangement with the Green Guards it is hoped to secure the safety of a considerable number who remain behind.BatourruIt in reported that French only intend sending &amp; small detachment to assist in garrisoning the town.

Commander-In-Chief will leave Siinonstown in &quot;Birmingham&quot; on the 6th April to visit Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban, returning to Simonstown about the I2th MayaJUGOSLAVIA.The Government of the Serbs Croats and Slovenes has addressed three notes to the Supreme Council.   The first draws attention to the fact that there are at present no facilities for maritime communication along the Eastern Adriatic littoral, and requests that those ships formerly belonging to Austro-Hungarian lines which are of undoubted Jugo-Slav ownership may be placed at the disposal of the Jugo-Slav Government.The second note places on record the fact that Jugo-Slavia, while accepting the offer of 12 ex enemy destroyers for police purpose, reaffirms her claim to the late Austro Hungarian fleet aThe third note asks that various stores, docks, machin-ery etc. in the Gull of Cattaro may be handed over to the Jugo-Slav Government, in order that necessary ship repairs may be carried out at the dockyard of TeodoaRUMANIA.The Rumanian Government has requested that a senior British Naval Officer may be sent to Bucharest in order to discuss the terms of an offer of Naval assistance recently made by Great Britain.GREECE.The Greek Government have now agreed to accommodate a number of Russian Refugees at Lemnos, Mitylene and the Russian Hospital at the Piraeus.   They have also agreed to house 800 sick and &quot;wounded at Salonika and 100 at Corfu.The above is however contingent on an agreement being arrived at regarding cost and upkeep and supply of medical stores, as the Greek Government are unable to supply either stores or funds.Turkey/Caspian Fleet, intends to make Enzeli a sub-base *   The British view that internment of ships using Persian ports is essential, remains unchanged.*DANUBE *Foreign Office has requested that one of the gunboats of the Danube Flotilla may&quot;be sent to Pressburg in view of the possibility of an outbreak of Bolshevism following on the arrival of Bela Kun thereeThe Hungarian Prime Minister regards the state of affairs at Pressburg as the beginning of a Bolshevik spring offensive, and expects outbreaks in Belgrade and in Rumania also.RED     SEA.Fighting continues between the Imam&apos;s troops and the Idrissl and Quhra force,   &quot;he Imam has issued proclamations to the effect that he proposes to occupy Hodeidan, in which case it will be necessary to reinforce the Garrison thereo   The GoO*C. Aden is of opinion that the continued presence of a British warship at Hodeidah may be necessary.AFRICA o
TURKEY *General Franchet d&apos;Esperey has, as was anticipated, adopted the attitude that as Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Orient he is in control of the operations at Constantinople, and some&apos; friction has. occurred in Constantinople.   The British Govern-ment has taken tho matter up with the French Government on the basis that Constantinople is included in Turkey in Asia, and there-fore comes under General Milne&apos;s control.The Commander of the Turkish troops, in Thrace, Jaffar Tayar, has announced that he has assumed-supreme control in the Adrianople Vilayet, has out all communications with Constantinople&apos; and will not accept orders from there.   Also that similar procedure will be,followed in Asia Minor East of Ismid.   He has asked that General Milne may be informed that, as regards the Adrianople Vilayet, the armistice terms are denounced and Allied forces will be opposed by force; an independent Government will be set up under which it is hoped to protect the lives and property of Christians.. Further, unless the peace terms&apos;are accepted by a representative of the Turkish Government, under nfo coercion by Great Britain,       V. he will resist with all the forces at his disposal.Jaffar is an able man, belongs to the C .U .P. and probably acts fcn collusion: with i-ustapha Kemal..  The news is serious and will very likely be followed by news of a Greek massacre in Thrace.The only Allied troops in Thrace are one Greek Battalion. &apos; GERMANY iThe Supreme Council has approved of Memel being allotted a flag to be flown by vessels belonging to the District, pending its probable allocation to Lithuania..The Conference of Ambassadors have ruled that the German Government be allowed to retain the following number of surface warships &quot;in reserve&quot; with their guns on board but with no crews, munitions or stores &apos;:-2 Battleships. 2 Light Cruisers,  , 4 Destroyers, 4 Torpedo-Boats.The Inter-Allied Naval Commission of Control will decide which ships shall be used for the above purpose and the number of guns which each ship in reserve shall retain.&apos; MISCELLANEOUS HOME INTELLIGENCE.New Cunarder.
