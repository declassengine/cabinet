1(1   J   \?**Military Secret. 133560 From Viceroy, Foreiyn and Political Department, to Secretary of Stale for India,2()th&apos;March 1920.(Received 22nd.)325 S. Your 896, dated 9th March, to Army Department. We are dealing fully in a separate telegram with Waziristan situation and policy we advocate there. Following is brief! review of frontier situation generally.2. North of Kabul River tribal situation is fairly normal. Some excitement was caused by Nadir KhaiVs interview with North-West Frontier tribal jirga at Hada on 3.1st January, and presentation of standards to iUohmands and Bajaur tribes, but this is now subsiding. Customary efforts of a few Mullahs to stir up anti-British feeling are meeting with little success.3. In case of Afridis, results of Nacla jirga have been more pronounced owing to efforts of their Maliks. Surrender of Government rifles was proceeding steadily, but since jirga practically no rifles have been received, and Maliks express their inability to force tribe to comply with our terms until Afghan situation is cleared up. The tribes, especially the Bazar Zakka Khel, are in state of unrest and uncertainty, and intend to endeavour to probe Nadir Khan&apos;s real intentions at expected further inter-views of their jirga at Dakka. Raiding is confined to Zakka Khel section. Other sections are loyally fulfilling their promises to abstain from raiding themselves, and to intercept parties of Zakka Khel dacoits passing through their limits.4. Attitude at Kurram (corrupt group) is satisfactory. . Orakzais are well in hand, and, in spite of efforts of Mullah Mahmucl Akhundzada, have surrendered practically whole of rifles due from them. Recent defeat of Mangal Lashkar by Kurram Militia and Turi villagers has had good effect in Kurram, as well as in Khost, and among Northern Waziri tribes. Kohat-Kiirram Force has been strengthened by one additional brigade. Newly-raised local levies in Miranzai Valley have been doing good work, and there is marked decrease in raids of all descriptions throughout this area.5. Situation at Northern Waziristan is fairly satisfactory. During the period of active resistance by Mahsuds, Tochi and Waziris suspended their efforts to carry out the terms which they had accepted, but since Mahsuds&apos; collapse they have resumed payment of fines and deliveries of rifles. Destruction of Makin and visit of Derajat Column to Kanigorum appear to have convinced Mahsud leaders that further resistance is futile, and effort is now being made to comply with terms, but democratic con-stitution of tribes makes it unlikely that fall compliance can be secured without prolonged occupation of commanding positions, which we now hold in Mahsud country. Wana Waziris reported to be collecting rifles in anticipation of the pre-sentation of terms. Question of policy to be adopted in view of saving of time by Mahsuds in compliance will form the subject of a separate telegram. We do not in anv case anticipate much further serious resistance.6. Sherannis have practically complied with terms in full and no operations against them will be necessary. Column proceed from Draban on 2.1st instant to re-establish the Waziri Tribe Constabulary Posts.7. In Zhob there has been recrudescence of minor raids from across the border carried out by some outlaws from Zhob and some by Suliman Khel.8. Ultimate situation on Frontier still depends largely on attitude of Afghanistan. Dominant note of present Afghan policy is unity of Mohammedans especially of Pathans. Afghan Government fully realise vital, importance of maintaining influence over North-AVest Frontier tribes in the event of another war with India, and extravagant demands in this respect may be expected from Afghan delegates in Mussoorie if conference takes place. Majority of North-West Frontier tribes now realise that no material help is forthcoming for them from Afghanistan, but Afridis still hope they may be absolved from surrendering Government rifles as result of further Anglo-Afghan negotiations. It is growing daily clearer Afghanistan counts mainly on tribes on British North-West Frontier border for action against us, as they are far better fighting material than his own tribes, and if we brought our tribes under more control, thus depriving her of all hopes of their support, she would almost certainly
not dare to attack us again. Expenditure on increased control over our tribes is thus Lest possible insurance against Afghanistan.9. There are no signs of any military activities in Kabul. Afghan public opinion is reported to consider resumption of hostilities unlikely, to be looking for important results from anticipated &quot; Friendship Treaty &quot; with India. Amir and Mahsud Tarsi, however, are still dazzled by idea of: Mohammedan confederation centring on Kabul. Their negotiations with Bolsheviks have taken more definite forms, and outlines of military, political and commercial agreement have been discussed with Suritz Mission. There are indications, however, that mutual suspicion is developing. Bolsheviks are viewed with disfavour in many quarters of Afghanistan, and present friction on Herat border may lead to interesting developments.10. Viewed as a whole, situation on Frontier shows marked, improvement. Severe punishment administered to Mahsuds is having salutary effects elsewhere, and failure of tribes to secure any material help from Afghanistan is operating in our favour.
