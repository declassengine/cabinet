9JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,i\ . H * I * o .instructions of the Cabinet as to the attitude which   he should adopt towards the amendment which is to be moved in the Standing Committee dealing with the. Unemployment Insurance Bill whereby it is sought to fix the rate of unemployment benefit for women at 15s. instead of 12s., as proposed in the Bin,     As the Schemes of Unemployment Insurance and National Health Insurance are closely related to one another I feel it my duty to point out to the Cabinet the probable effect which the acceptance of the amendment would have upon the National Health Insurance Scheme.(2) Under the National Health Insurance Bill which is. now before Parliament awaiting a second reading the proposed rates of sickness benefit for men and women are the same as the rates of unemployment benefit proposed in the Unemployment Insurance Bill viz. 15s. a week in the case of men and 12s. a week in the case of women.     It will be generally admitted that under  compulsory State Schemes of Insurance a women must be entitled to receive as much when she is out of work and   ill as when she is out of work and in good health.     If, therefore, the rate of unemployment benefit for women is to be 15s. a week it would be exceedingly difficult to resist the demand which must inevitably be made that the rate of sickness benefit for women must also be increased to 15s.(3) Such an Increase in the rate of sickness benefit forwomen would, however, be open to very serious objection.     In the first place, if the financial basis of the Health Insurance scheme proposed increase of Women&apos;s Unemployment BeneTit to&quot;!?1 if teen ShillTngs.Effect on National Health Insurance.Memorandum by. the Minister of Health.(1)I am informed that the Minister of Labour is asking theis/
49 III Iis to be maintained under which the cost of the benefits is met out of contributions by workers and their employers with a specified proportion of the cost from the Exchequer, it will be necessary, in order to support a sickness benefit of 15s. for women, that the weekly contribution should be increased from 6d. to lOd. instead of from 6d. to 9d. as proposed in the Bill and that the worker&apos;s share of the contribution should be increased by 2d, instead of Id.    Qvtofo an increase in the amount to be deducted from the wages of women workers for Health Insurance contributions as compared with the increase of Id. only in the case of men would be bound to arouse serious opposition and would be almost impossible to justify, especially in the case of the less well paid women workers.     Indeed, it is probable that the objection to increasing the women!s share of the contribution by double &quot;that pr r)Osed in the case of men would be so strong that it would lead to a demand that the additional Id. should fall upon the Exchequer.    This would involve an additional annual charge fen the Exchequer of  950,000,(4) Quite apart, however, from the possibility of  the exchequer having to bear the cost of the necessary increase of contributions the extra cost on the Exchequer in order to meet the normal State proportion, viz, 2/9ths, of * 15s. sickness benefit would amount to over a quarter of a million, Including the necessary increase in the Women&apos;s Equalisation Fund,  . (5) It is not, however, solely on the ground of theIncreased cost that I am opposed to the fixing of a higher rate of sickness benefit for women.     I believe that the rate of 12s, a week proposed in the Bill is as high as is desirable in the Interests of sound administration.    The raising of the rate to 15s. a week would increase the temptation to malingering andwould
would consequently Increase the administrative difficulties of Approved Societies in checking claims and preventing imposition on their Funds.    Especially will this difficulty  arise in the case of domestic servants, charwomen, workers on farms &amp;c., who will be insured for health insurance benefits only, being outside the scope of the unemployment scheme;   these classes comprise over 1,500,000 women..    Further, in the case of married women, of whom the are are 700,000 insured, a rate of sickness benefit which would be double that at present provided would lead to very heavy claims upon the Benefit Funds, which might result in serious deficiencies in many cases.Finally, the Health Insurance Bill in its present form has been carefully considered by, and has received the unanimous approval of, the Consultative Council of the Ministry on National Health Insurance, and before making such important changes in the Bill as would be involved by the increase in the rate of sickness benefit for women I should feel it necessary to submit the matter to the Consultative Council, and I fear I should have considerable difficulty in securing general concurrence in the proposal.I feel it my duty, therefore, to urge in the interests of National Health Insurance that the proposal amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Bill should be resisted.0.
