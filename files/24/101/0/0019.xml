The report raises important questions of policy, to which I would invite the attention of my colleagues.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office,20 th March, 1920.Cologne,17th March, 1920.1. Marshal Foch conducted a war game at Mayence on 15th and 16th March, in which a large number of Allied Generals and Staff Officers took part, some 200 officers being present.2. This war game showed that with the Allies at their present strength and distribution it is a perfectly feasible operation of war for the Germans to force the line of the Rhine and to engage the Allies in a series of operations on the left bank of the river which would probably entail their having to bring up considerable reinforce-ments from the mother countries. But the war game and my 10-day visit to the Rhine showed me many other things besides the fact that the Allies are not sufficiently strong to hold the line of the river against an attack by even a small force of the enemy, and it may be useful if I state, very shortly, the impressions I formed : (a.) The German to-day is a very different man from what he was when I wras here last August. He is no longer taking the overwhelming strength of the Allies for granted, and he is measuring, with a military eye, the military values of the very indifferent and inefficient Belgian troops, the small and wholly untrained British force, the Americans who may at any moment be withdrawn, and the French forces composed, as they are, in large part (60 per cent.) of black troops.(6.) To a military nation like Germany there is no longer much to fear from the Allied garrisons of the Ehine, which possess no offensive pow7er whatever. In short, the German of to-day realizes that the Allied troops on the Rhine are no longer an instrument capable of being used to coerce him should he do something which incurred the displeasure of the Supreme Council. From such a frame of mind&quot; it is a short step for a German to pass to open contempt and flagrant disobedience of Allied commands. From, the foregoing I make the following deduction that in the near future we shall have to reinforce our garrisons or come awray.(c.) The state of Belgium and the moral of her troops makes her attitude a very uncertain factor in the event of fighting breaking out.(d.) From the military point of view it is inadmissible that a Holland which shelters the German Kaiser, and which in many of its activities is extremely German, should be allowed to remain neutral. It is a dangerous situation for the troops from Cologne down the river to Bimmen, a stretch of 80 miles, where the Rhine enters Holland, to have in their rear a doubtful or, at best, a neutral which would enforce neutrality, and thus make it impossible for the Allies to reinforce or to retire through its country.(B20/145)   50  3/20   H&amp;S  8055wo
2. From the two preceding paragraphs (6) and (c), I deduce that a close offensive, and defensive Alliance should be entered into between the British, French and Belgian Governments, and that a very clear understanding be&apos; reached with Holland as to her attitude in the event of trouble.3. In paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), I am taking it for granted that so long as His Majesty&apos;s Government keep troops on the Rhine it is their intention to defend both Belgium and France from German aggression.I can well imagine a Militarist Germany or a Bolshevist Germany, led by an out-standing figure, raising the standard of patriotism and the call of clearing Germany of all foreign invaders, in much the same way as Lenin and Trotsky cleared Russia of the followers of Kolchak and of Denikin, and of French troops near Odessa and of British at Novorrossisk and near Archangel and Murmansk, and it is with this possibility in view that I write these words of warning about the future.4. There is one other point I should like to bring to the notice of the Cabinet. I am uneasy about the position of our troops in the Plebiscite areas. It is a matter for the Supreme Council to decide as to whether the object aimed at in those areas is worth the undoubted military risks and possible discomfort, discredit and danger, to which these troops may be exposed if, later on, they have to be withdrawn under pressure. I would remind the Cabinet that we have had some experience of this sort of operations and that in each case they have been altogether unsatisfactory, whether in North Russia, Siberia, South Russia, Syria or elsewhere.If, then, the Supreme Council would agree, my advice would be to withdraw our troops from Dantzig and East Prussia, if not from Flensburg also.5. Briefly to recapitulate : (a.) The Germans no longer fear the Armies of the Rhine. (6.) The state of Belgium and her Army are unsatisfactory.(c.) The neutrality of Holland under the present conditions is a grave militarydanger to the Allies. (d.) Our troops in the Plebiscite areas should be withdrawn.6. And to meet these points I suggest that (a.) We decide, in the near future, to strengthen our forces or withdraw.(6.) We come to a firm Alliance with France and Belgium if we decide toremain on the Rhine, (c.) We make Holland define her situation and intentions.(d.) We press the Supreme Council to agree to our withdrawal from Dantzig and East Prussia.HENRY WILSON, Field-Marshal.Chief of the Imperial General Staff.v
