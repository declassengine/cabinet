Stock which are ready for the hutcher cannot possibly be held ever without gr,ave deterioration; and the whole arrangements made by farmers with regard to fat stock would he dislocated, and the result would be very heavy loss,There is already a great deal of feeling about the prevalence of the imported meat,,&apos; much of which is of a very inferior quality; and about the difficulty in getting home-grown meat; and I am satisfied that any attempt to interfere with the ordinary business of the farmer in this respect would raise a great outcry and place the Government in an impossible position.(intlld.)
