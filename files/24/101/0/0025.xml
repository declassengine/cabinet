Board of Customs and Excise,I circulate herewith a note which I have received from theChairman of the Board of Customs and Excise in regard to a suggestion for further graduation of the beer duty.      I have not thought it necessary to circulate- the memorandum referred to by the Chairman as the points are fully summarised in his note.(Intd:)   A.CThe Treasury, S.Y/,1, March 22nd, 1920.
OOPY.Chancellor of the Exchequer:I enclose a memorandum on the suggested further graduation of the Bear Duty.The salient points are 1.      Strong beers are already discriminated against -(a) by the fact that the duty increases for a given quantity of beer in proportion to its strength.   Thus with the present rate of duty. 70s; Base*s best beer aii 10600 pays 25s. per bulk barrel more in duty than beer of 1040o.(the aotual average for Great Buitain today);(b) by control of prices which enables the Government to cut down profits on the heavier and more expensive beers. Thus today the same priae is charged for all beers of 10540 and over,2.      Additional duties in hgavy beers were introduced into the Houseof Opmmons in 1915 as a War measure to discourage -thelr-c^naumpiiAon.They were mainly opposed on the ground that specialised trades sunn asGuinness&apos;s would be unfairly hit and according to an official Pressannouncement of the day the duties were dropped owing to Irishopposition.3.        Apart from War requirements there appears to be less need for a graduated duty today than in 1915 for the following reasons(a) the higher rate of duty in force (70s, as compared with 23s,) provides automatically a much more severe discrimination against the heavy beers;(b) the average-ge gravity of the beer now being brewed is less by about 10Q in Great Britain and 150 in Ireland than the corresponding averages in 1915,     The quantity of heavy beer now being brewed is therefore much less than in that year;(c) Controlled prices now enable the Government to penalise the brewing of heavy beer.The practical objections to a system of surtaxes would be :-(a) The surtax can easily be evaded by mixing a small quantity of beer of high gravity with a larger quantity of low gravity, and producing a strong beer which would largely escape the surtax;
(lo) It would facilitate fraud an connection-with drawback on exported beer;(c) The control of prices would bo difficult, and could easily be defeated;(d) The Revenue derived would be trifling. 5.     The trade objections would be :-(a) disturbance of trade conditions and feeling of in&amp;ocurity against unfair&apos;competition by any brewers dispose-d to be fraudulent:(b) inequality of incidence amongst different sections of the trade.     The tax would fall so heavily on brewers nAcu as Bass, Worthington and Guinness as to destroy their special-ised trades.(Sd.)   H.P, HAMILTON.Board Room, Custom House, I Lower Thames Street, 2,0.3,, 20th March, 1920.
