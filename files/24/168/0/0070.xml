A 3 4IBIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMFIKT.CABINET.RENT   RESTRICTION;COPY No,mm15*8(24).-        Memorandum.by the Minister cf HealthsUnder the provisions of the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act, 1923, the duration of the principal Act, that is the Act of 1920, was prolonged until the 24th June, 1925c     After the expiry  of the principal Act a modified form Of control was provided for, but full control will, in the absence of amending legislation, expire in Jrrne of next yearaIf, as I thirtk the Cabinet will agree, it is not expedient to allow full control to terminate next June two alternative courses are opena     The duration of full control might be extended for a further pariod without any other amendment of the Act of 1923, or, while extending the duration of -full control, opportunity might be taken to amend some of the provisions of the existing Acts.0 My own view is -(a) that the period of full control should be extended to 1939, that is, a period corresponding with the 15 years&apos; building programme under the recent Housing Act, with possibly some provision for triennial review;(b) that the decontrol of houses provided for under the Act of 19?3 should ceaBe;(c) that the permitted increases of rent should be reduced to an amount equivalent to the present cost of repairs and the present rate of interest, cost of living, etc., as compared with 1920 when the 40 per cent, was fixed. The Act of 1920 allowed the pre-war rents of houses within[the purview of the Act to be Increased by the following amounts (a) For structural alterations (other than decoration or repairs), 6 per centc on the outlay if incurred between 4th August, 1914, and 2nd July, 1920, and 8 per cent0 on the outlay if incurred, after 2nd July, 1920,1
....  (h) Where the landlord pays rates, an increase equal to the     &apos;iuJ increase in rates over the rates paid in the rate period including 3rd August, 1914, or the rate period including the date when rates were first paid.(c) An increase of 15 per cent, of the&apos;net rent (that is, the rent less the amount of the rates paid by the landlord).(d) Where the landlord is responsible for the whole of the repairs, an increase of 25 per cent, of the net rent,     If the landlord and tenant share responsibility for repairs, the 25 per cent is split up in proportion to thsir responsibility.The last two increases, of 25 per cent, and 15 per cento espectively, were based on the recommendations of Lord Salisbury&apos;s ommittee.    That Committee estimated that the cost of repairs in 1920 as at least 150 per cent0 above the pre-war cost, and thought that this ddltlon might fairly be put at 25 per cent0 of the rent exclusive of ates,thls figure being taken to include some small extra provision or increased costs of management and insurance,As regards the 15 per cent, increase, 10 per cent, of this s intended to enable the owner to pay the   increased rate of interest one per cent, allowed to the mortgagee under the Act (two-thirds the value of the house was assumed to be mortgaged), and the training 5 per cent, was intended to give the landlord an increased te of interest of one per cent, on his own capital.As regards the 25 per cent, increase to meet the increased t of repairs, the cost of repairs has fallen very considerably ice 1930,     It is not easy to give general figures as to the actual &apos;t of house repairs, as the cost varies with the character and age different buildings, but the increase in rates of wages and the jceaof materials used in connection with house repairs would account Ian increase in the cost of repairs of something over BO per cent.    . the present time as compared with the year 1913-14, I The increase in the cost of repairs over the pre-warlire may thus be said to be, at the present time, little more H half the increase-estimated by Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee in H&apos; an-o\ if the 25 per cent., allowed under this head by the Act of
&apos;i u \J1920 were reduced -proportionately, the figure would now be about 13 per cent.As regards the 15 per cent, increase intended to provide for an increased rate of interest on mortgage and on the landlord&apos;3 own capital, in allowing for the Increase of one per cent, on mort-gages Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee stated that in the ordinary case of a mortgage bearing interest at 4% per cent, this would bring the figure up to 5-g per cent., which, having regard to the return from other securities at that time, was in their opinion not too high.The average rate of Interest on securities at.the present time is approximately 5/6ths of the rate prevailing in 1920, and, if this decline In the returns from other securities as compared with 1920 were used as a basis for reassessing the amount of increase in Interest on mortgages and owner!s capital allowable&apos; in the case of . rent restricted houses, the figure of 15 per cent, would have to be reduced by about l/6th, that is to 12-g- per cent.On the other hand the rate of interest on securities has recently been showing a tendency to rise, and, further, the rate of interest charged, at the present time by building societies and local authorities on repayment or annuity mortgages is still about 5 to 5^-per cent,, and the rate charged by private Investors or trustees on standing mortgages is 5-jj to 6 per cent.Again, if the net yield on securities to the investor, afterdeduction of Income Tax, is taken as the measure, the reduction ascompared with 1920 will be approximately one-twelfth only - thereduction in interest being partially off-set by reduced Income TaxSod. s*-deduction (4/6 instead of 6/&apos;.).    This might be considered relevanton the ground that if Income Tax had remained unchanged the currentInterest rates would probably be higher.    On the other hand, however,there are other factors involved, e.g. deflation and the cessation ofboom demand for capital.On the whole I think it fair that the permitted increase ofper cent, should be reduced to 30 or perhaps 25 per cent.1&apos;;(Intld.)
