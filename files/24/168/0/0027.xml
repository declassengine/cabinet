DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).1.    I regret that I am unable to concur In the proposals made by Mr. Henderson, but after consulting the Governors of the Colonies concerned I find that they are convinced that these proposals would not be effectual and that the attempt to carry them out would have very serious oonsequences to these Colonies.2.     I have read the Home Office memorandum which sets out clearly the necessity&quot;for a Cabinet decision as to the polioy to be adopted by the British Delegates to the International Opium Conference in November, and I quite appreciate that If the policy advocated by the Home Office could be oarried out, there would be no further ground for the adverse criticism to which we are exposed in certain quarters.    Whether it would put an end to such criticism is another matter.3.    It is clear however from the Reports which I have received from the Governors of the Far Eastern Colonies that they not only consider that the adoption Of a policy of Total prohibition would give rise to feelings of great resentment among the masses of the Chinese populations of their territories and would create very serious and (in views of the Governors) insoluble problems for the Govern-ments concernedj   but also that the adoption of thispolicy would not carry us a single step further towards theCRET.425 (24).CABINET.OPIUM POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for
ultimate total suppression of opium smoking which is one of the main objects of the Opium Convention signed at the-Hague in 1912.4.    the only article In the Convention whioh (it la alleged) is not being carried out in the Par Eastern Colonies reads as follows&quot;The oontraoting Powers shall take measures for the gradual and effective suppression of the manufacture of, internal Trade in, and use of prepared opium, with due regard to the varying oiroumstancea of each country concerned&quot;. 5.    Briefly my view is that (1) the policy advocated by the Home Offloe does not pay that regard for the local circum-stances of the Par Eastern Colonies   and Protectorates which Is contemplated by the convention;   (2) It is in direct opposition to the very strongly expressed views of the Governors, who have been assisted in arriving at their con-clusions by the Reports of very representative local Committees which have considered the matter carefully in all its aspects; and (3) that although the Conference Is being convened to consider measures for the more effective application of the Convention, total prohibition within a stated time goes far beyond the language of the convention.6.    The measures which have already been taken in Malaya and Hong Kong to give effect to the Article which I have quoted may be summarised as follows:The manufacture and wholesale distribution of prepared opium has been taken out of the hAnda of private persons, by the ereation of Government monopolies in the various Colonies, and steps are now being taken to complete this process by completely eliminating the llcenoed retailers.    Government opium of high quality la sold at an artificially high price (fixed by the Government) with a view to restricting consumption The amount that may be In the possession of any person   at any time is strictly limited.    Very heavy penalties (generally followed by banishment) are lnflioted on persona found Inpossession of any opium other than/-2-
Government opium, or convicted of trafficking In opium; mid considerable forces of preventive officers with urastlo powers of search are maintained.7,    Apart- from the high price charged for the Government opium and the penalties imposed In respect of Illicit opium, there is no check on consumption; and although the Governors maintain that shortness of purse on the one hand and fear of the cense-quenoes on the other do in faot keen the opium lie bit well within hounds, it has to be admitted that the continuance of the present policy cannot lead to the total suppression of the smoking habit.8.    This fact, as well ea the feet that considerable proportions of the Colonial revenues are derived from the profits of the opium monopolies, leaves the various Colonial Governments (and the British Government responsible for them) open to criticism, and the situation hus to be faced.     Before discussing the revenue question I propose to deal with the practioablllty of the institution of further measures for the more effective application of Artiole 6 of the Convention, and since the Oircumatances of the various territories ere so radically different, It is necessary to consider them individually.     I will deal first with Hong Song as the Issue there is to some extent   more &quot;clear out&quot;, 9.    Hong KoogjiPer the purpose of the question now before the Cabinet, Hong Kong la geographically and racially an integral part of China and with the exception of a mere handfuj, the whole of Its population ( estimated at well over a million) is Chinese. It has a total area cf 376 square miles and a coest and frontier line of 400 miles over any part of which Chinese may come end go at will.    In fact It is estimated that some ten to twelve thousand Chinese pasa dally between Hong Kong and China,    A large part of the population, having permanent homes In China,-3-/is
is in the Colony for a longer or shorter period according to the prospeots of remunerative work and&quot;there are periodical in-rushes of refugees who escape from disorder in China and dribble back at varying intervals ae quiet Is restored to their individual village or districts. Moreover Hong Kong is the second largest port in the world and in addition to an immense trade in ocean going and coasting steamers, the port Is thronged by countless junks whioh come and go at will,10,    These conditions are sufficient to invalidate atChina, and where the Chinese are an alien and not an indigenous race and form a very small fraction of the total population. Even in such of these territories as have adopted them,the systems of registration and rationing of opium smokers have (in the view of the Governor of  the Straits Settlements) achieved only a limited success as regards the indigenous populations,and non sucoess amounting practically to failure when it is sought to impose the seme measures on the Chinese. The Governor also makes a point of the fact that registration and rationing would cheok the flow of emigration of Chinese into Malaya, with very serious effects upon the labour supply and the prosperity of that country, and there would also of course, be very serious effects on Hong Kong, if any. &apos; ifmeasures taken impeded the free movement of Chinese from China   kto the Colony.11,    In Hong Kong in the view of the Hong Kong Committee (in whioh the Governor concurs) no system involving individual oontrol of opium smokers (such as is involved in e system of     jl-4-/registration
.&quot;5    I&apos; I-     Vregistration and licencing) Is possible.    The key- jjnoteB to the situation are theundcubted existenceof a wide spread demand for opium for the purposes ofsmoking, the complete absence of any public opinioncondemning the practice, the existence of unlimitedsupplies of Chinese, Turkish and Persian opium, and inthe circumstances outlined above the virtual impossibility of stopping smuggling.     The Committee observe:&quot;Opium is carried in receptacles bolted outside tbe bottom of a junk, in a hollowed out spar, in a compartment insidea tin of petrol or a jar of wine, in the leg of a bedstead,in a bog of flour, in a woman&apos;s hair, in fact in every possible plaoe In which the ingenuity of the Chinesecan devise means to hide an article the bulk of whichia as small as its value is large.&quot;12.    The Committee have exoressed their conviction that any diminution in the amount of opium legitimately available would undoubtedly be counter-balanced by an increase in the use of illicit opium and that if the use of opium were prohibited it is probable that the situation would got entirely out of hand.    They suggest as a comparison the placing of a small foreign Government in Marseilles and the prohibition by it of the drinking of wine by the French within the town; except that opium is much more easily smuggled than wine.     They -suggest that it is impossible to prevent indulgence in &amp; practice which they describe as habitual in a nation of four hundred million people unless that nation desires to give up that indulgence, and unfortunately there is no present indication that the opium /habit
habit will be abandoned by the Chinese people in the near future.13.     It has been suggested that since presumably the smugglers arc already exerting their utmost efforts to evade the preventive measures now in force in the Colony, the mere maintenance of the present degree of vigilance would continue to restrain smuggling within due limits.     I have put this suggestion to the Sovonor who, however, has replied that at present the profits of smuggling are limited by the existence of supplies of legitimate opium.     If legitimate supplies were stopped the   temptation to smuggle would be increased, as much larger profits could be made, especially as wealthypeople who now use Government opium would be driven to Use .....contraband.     Even now, most of the large   seizures of illicit opiuio are due to information given by persons who have not been paid well enough to keep secret.   . With in-creased profits higher bribes would be   possible, and the Government could not oompete without greatly increasing their scale of rewards, whereas if deprived of the opium revenue the Governor     states that they could not afford to maintain the present scale.14.     He goes an to say that there would moreover be  . thousands of small smugglers of Chinese opium,    On account of the increased profits they could afford to bribe the Chinese Police and Revenue Officers.     Even if these were incorrupti-ble (which is   not the case) evasion would be   easy owing to the facility of landing from boats at hundreds of places on the coast.15.     In the Governor&apos;s view, therefore, prohibition could only be made effective by giving the police practically unlimited power to search persons and premises.     The Chinese Community has objected time and again to the methods of search
Ms statement Is U in ^e report l the local Comm-tfee which the Ivernor endorses, i are not aware fi; the aotual jthoas of search i It have no reason I doubt that they le exceptionally las tic).now erqployed, methods far more drastic than any used in this country.   To introduce more drastic measures would oausa such popular indigaation that not only would every Chinese be in sympathy with the smugglers but the satisfactory relations of the Government with the people would be greatly endangered,16.    A suggestion has been made, amounting ineffect to the view that &quot;honour would be satis-fied&quot; by passing a prohibition law end by merelymaintaining the preventive service at itB present level.   If the Governor&apos;b view as to the effectof suoh a measure is correct (and in such amatter I submit that we must accept his view) thiswould be impossible.   I cannot help anticipatingthat the lav; would be a dead letter that breacheswould be flagrant and continuous and that the prestige of the Government would suffer irreparable harm.   Moreover it is unlikely that our presentcritics would be satisfied but would clamour forthe very increases in the preventive measureswhich the Governor considers it would be dangerous to adopt,17.     I am aware that it is not suggested thatprohibition should be brought into force immediatelybut at some definite future date.   I submit however that if it is impossible now, no man con name adefinite date when it will be possible.   The Gover-nor has declared that he will be ready to close theGovernment monopoly so soon as China ceases to growopium.   When the Convention was signed in 1912, noone oould have imagined that China would be growingmore opium in 1924 then ever before in its history,and with China1s affairs in the existing state ofchaos, he would be a bold man who would venture toprophesy a definite date for the establishment of a stable Government in China, which would be able to
suppress the growth of the poppy.. , will agree in  these circumstances I cannot doubt that my colleagues /with me that it would be the height of folly, so far asHong Kong is concerned, to do more at this stage than to bind itself to the complete prohibition of the use ofopium in the Colony so Boon as China has shown to the satisfaction of an International Commission that she haspermanently ceased to grow It on any considerable soale.18.    So satisfied is the Hong Kong Government that the Colony has gone as far as it is safe to go in the matter of the control of opium smoking, that the officer who has been sent home aa the representative of that Govern-ment at the Conference in November, has suggested that the League of Nations should be invited to send out to the Par East an   independent Commission, consisting of (say) an unprejudiced American and a Frenchman to examine the problem on the spot, and to visit not only British territories but also those of France, the Netherlands and Portugal as well as Slam and the Phillipplnes.   If the Governments of the other countries would not agree, Hong Kong would be prepared if necessary to pay the entire expenses of such a commies ion *19.     I commend this suggestion to the careful con-slderatlon of my colleagues, as ap indication of the good faith of the Hong Kong Government.   I understand that the Foreign Office are favourably Impressed with the suggestion as the? consider that it would hove considerable value from a propaganda point of view.   In my opinion far too much attention has been unfairlv focussed on the British Colonies in connection with the opium question, largely through the honesty of the British Authorities (which is not reciprocated by Foreign Governments) in admitting the (inevitable, in existing circumstances) imperfections of the present systems.
30.    Malaya presents rather a different problem. Unlike Hong Kong It is not at the doors of China and unlike Hong Kong it is an extensive territory, half the size of the United Kingdom.   In these respects It resembles the N.E.I., but It differs from that country, in that of a total popluation of a million and a half, nearly three quarters of a million (or 48$ of the total) are Chinese; and in that a large proportion of that population being plantation and mining labour attracted from China, are constantly on the move.21.     In reply to my direct question the Governor has expressed the deoided view that a policy of total prohibition would meet with no success whatever.   Smuggling has not, as yet, developed into anything like the problem which it presents in Hong Kong, but the Governor is con-vinced that if ill-considered restrictions are placed on the sale of Government opium before the time Is ripe, it would be Absolutely beyond the competence of the authorities to prevent the entry of opium which (in the absence of any public opinion adverse to the practice of opium smoking) would inevitably be smuggled from China.   The Malayan Committee have pointed out the remarkable facilities for smuggling presented by the 1230 miles of coast line.   There are innumerable creeks running far inland and connecting with little known rivers and country roads and so to the main trunk roads and railways; hundreds of sparsely in-habited jungle islands and scores of rivers navigable for timber-laden junks and native craft, in any of which contraband can be concealed with little fear of detection,22.    The same reasons for not undertaking to adopt a policy of total prohibition at some definite future date apply with the same force to Malaya as to Hong Kong.
25.     While unable to   recommend this policy, the local Committee appointed to consider the matter in Malaya have however dram up a very carefully thought out scheme which in the opinion of the Governor (while he admits that there is and must be some element of doubt as to the full success of ?ny policy) promises a large measure of success in the object in view, (vizt the gradual but ultimately effective suppression of opium smoking), whereas he considers that the policy of prohibition promises no success whatever.24.     The Committee have come to the conclusion that In the circumstances of British tlalava, eventual elimination of oolum smoklnir can onlv be brought about by control over smokers individually, but they are emphatically of opinion for a variety of cogent reasons that any premature attempt to reduce the ameunt of opium freely placed on sale,   would produce the most deplorable results, and that an immediate attempt to introduce a system of registration would be foredoomed to failure. They have however submitted proposals   leading up to both registration and rationing in a. measurable   distance: in time; as well as for removing some of the worst features of the present system.25.     At the date when the Governor&apos;s despatch was written he had not had time to obtain the opinions on the Cornmittxfe proposals of all the various Governments of British Malaya  (a* to the significance of this variety some notes will be found later on in this memorandum), and the Governor was of opinion that they are so far-reaching in character that he could hardly expect that they would be welcomed by or even acceptable to all the different Governments concerned.   These Governments   could however be induced to put them into force, ard I submit
that they should be given a fair trial, in preference       g-jto a policy which, in the opinion of all those whose knowledge of local conditions Invests them with authority to speak, would lead to a disastrous failure with lasting adverse effects on the country.26.    The only other territories nhloh are concerned in the matters to be dealt with at the Con-ference are the State of North Borneo, and Sarawak. These are both Independent states under British pro-tectlon, and while In accordance with the charter of the British North Borneo Company, and an agreement in the case of Sarawak, His Majesty&apos;s Government controls the foreign relations of both states, It has undertaken not to Interfere with the internal administration of either. This undertaking is absolute in the case of Sarawak, though in the case of North. Borneo His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State may in certain circumstances make suggestions in accordance with which the company must act.27.    Both these Governments were asked to consider the suggestions made by the Advisory Committee for the more effective application of Article 6 of the Opium Con-vention.   I have not vet received a report from Sarawak, but I have been informed semi-officially that the Sarawak Government has decided to Introduce a system of registration and individual rationing of opium smokers.   The position In that state can therefore, from this point of view, be considered satisfactory.28.    The British North Borneo Company on the other hand, after careful enquiry have come to the conclusion that conditions in their Territory are not suitable for the . introduction of such a system, and they are not prepared to go further than to watch the results of registration in neighbouring territories with a view to its possible ultimate adoption In North Borneo.. &apos;-j
295     I am sure that the Company would resist strenuously any endeavour on our part to induce them to adopt such a measure as total prohibition at a definite date, but I have no doubt that I could induce them to adopt a scheme on the lines of that proposed by the Malayan Committee. 3 0.     The Sgvenue. question.The Some Office suggest that, failing a decision in favour of total prohibition, the Colonial Governments should proceed with such improvements in the existing systems as can he devised and at the same time should dissociate the profits of the opium monopolies from the general revenues of the Colonies and use them for humanitarian and social services outside the ordinary sphere of Government activities - the process to be reread over a number of years0 31.     I may say at once that when it was first made to me I was much attracted by this suggestion which, if it could be adopted, would clear the Colonial Governments of any suspicion that their vested interests are preventing them from taking more effective action to carry out the terms of the Convention,   The comparatively small, compact and prosperous Colony of Vong .&quot;,&apos;ong would present no serious difficulty as tho Governor has often declared that the revenue quest ion was quite irrelevant there.   I felt, however, that I could not agree   to the suggestion on behalf of the complex array of States which comprise British Malaya without consulting the Governor and High Commissioner. 32.     British Malaya is by no mams a homogeneous whole. It consists of -(l)     The comparatively densely populated Colony of the Htraits Settlements dependent mainly on the prosperity of the free port of Singapore, and to a le-,s (though still great) extent, :.&apos;en?.ng.S
(2)    The Federated Malay States, vrtiose prosperity is bound up with that of the tin and planting (mainly rubber) industries. Both these industries have in the course of the last three years suffered from an unprecedented slump, and from Its position as probably the most flourishing country In the Empire, the Bederation was brought to a critical financial condition, from which it is only just beginning very slowly to recover. Of tho States comprising the Federation, Perak, Selangor and Hegri Sembilan are opened up and reasonably accessible through-out.   Panang is less advanced, and has many villages, estates and mines buried in the depths of jungle covered mountains, extremely difficult of access. (3)    The Unfederated States.(a) Johore, which is in much the same position as the Federated Malay States and(b) Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trenganu in the M^lay peninsula, and the small State of Brunei in theI .land of Borneo.   For the -most part these States consist of mountainous and jungle country and they are remote, backward and difficult of access. 33.     The Straits Settlements and the Federated M,lay States are administered mainly by European Officers of the Malayan Civil Service; The Unfederated States --cinly by their Malay micro, -,1th native officers, but acting on the advice of Briti.li Advisers responsible to the High Commissioner at Singapore.34,     The political relations of the High Commissionerwith the Malay Hulers (not only of the Unfoderated butFederated States)&apos;are very delicately balanced and the -also of the/smooth administration of the States and thedevelopment of British policy in the Peninsula depends to agreat extent on carrying the Hulers and their people with us in any matters which vitally affect their well being,35.    I have received the following telegram from the governor and High Commissioner in reply to my enquiry.whether the MalayanGovernments would accept in principle the suggestion for the gradual surrender of opium revenue:-
- \ 184&quot;Confidential Opium (i) American proposals.   On behalf of the whole of Malaya enter strongest objections against the acceptance of the principle that no State is to draw any nett revenue from the control.   In the Colony enforcement of the principle especially at the suggestion of foreign Governments could only be carried in opposition to public opinion with dangerous results and strain of loyalty.   In Malay States its enforcement would mean the loss of British prestige.   It would also especially in view of uncertainty of revenue from rubber and tin involve financial troubles of incalculable extent.   The incidence of any income tax would be resented and a high income tax would arouse the fiercest feeling amongst all races against the British Government. The people Of country would say that in order to deprive them of use for general purpose of revenue which they consider natural and legitimate they are to be burdened with new and unnecessary taxation. They would contend that revenue from Opium differs little if at all from revenue from alcohol and thoy would ask whether any nation is justified in objecting to another nation deriving revenue from aloohol.   fii) British delegates suggestion (s).   This in the opinion of ray advisers  and myself will not bear investigation.   It would mean that the Government of Malaya would be endeavouring with an inoome tax steadily increasing towards a danger point to carry on necessary services whilst an increasing portion of their revenue was being diverted to a fund which is unnecessary and even dangerous as building up services which as Opium Traffic declines will be eventually left in the air with no money to pay for them.
I am not parepared to adopt the suggestion in principle.   I do not believe that it would be practicable in Malaya even if the French Indo-China Hetherlands East Indies adopt it which I oannot believe will be the case.   Hong Kong a self contained Colony with easier financial conditions affords no parallel.Earnestly beg that Malaya may be allowed to develop its polioy of steady and continuous reduction of opium consumption on our own lines.   It oan only be carried out at a rate proportionate to the response by the population to legislative and Executive action by the Government,   Attempts to force the pace will result in smuggling and corruption and will create desire for alcohol and substitutes for opium such as morphia and oooaine.   Rapid progress impossible with present attitude of China as a result of whioh smuggling into Malaya cannot be effectively controlled and immigrant Chinese arrive addicted to the opium habit&quot;.36,     The first part of the telegrem refers to a proposal put forward by the United States Government that the Conference should aocept the principle that no State should draw any revenue from the oontrol of opium beyond the expenses incident to the exercise of the control.   The second part of the telegram refers to the suggested dissociation of the opium revenues from tho general revenues of the Colonies,37.     In amplification of this telegram I should explain that practically the whole of the develop-ment of British Malaya - railways, docks, waterworks,
hospital and sanitary services (including very extensive anti-malarial measuros) has been paid for out of current revenues.   Without the revenues derived from Opium development on anything like the scale which has been carried out, would havo been impossible.   In the truest sense then these opium revenues have in fact been employed on social and humanitarian services, the maintenance of which now entails very heavy recurrent expenditure.   Moreover from their accumulated   balances both the Colony and the Federated Malay States rendered extraordinarily generous financial assistance to this country during the war.38.     I submit that in this present time of financial depression, in Malaya&apos;s hour of need, it would have the worst possible effects on our relations with the rulers and people of these States if His Hajesty&apos;s Government were to insist on a measure which has no direct bearing on the question of the suppression of opium smoking, but is merely suggested as a sop to ill-informed American and other prejudices.39.     In saying thi3 I recognise (and I am sure that the Malayan Governments also recognise) that with the. gradual supression of the consump-tion of opium which it is hoped will ultimately be the result of the scheme elaborated by the Malayan opium Committee, those Governments must look to and mako provision for a gradual reduotlon in the revenues which they now derive from the sale of opium.-16-
40.     If the Cabinet, as I suggest in the circumstances they ought, rejects the Home Office proposal, I intend to take up seriously with the Malayan Govern-ments this question of the gradual replacement of the opium revenues.   The matter will of course have to he enquired into very carefully by experts, but the soi*t of provision I have in mind is the gradual building up of a fund the income from Which in addition to such alternative sources of revenue as can be devised will&apos;as the revenue from opium decreases be available to meet the expenses of the preventive services which may bo expected to increase par! panau with the suppression of the use of opium, as well as for the maintenance ox valuable social services which, but for the existence of opium revenue in the past, could never have been undertaken on anything like the extensive scale which thoy have been.41.     Some such provision, I think, the Malayan Governments should make, and while the High Commis-sioner assures us that they would bitterly resent doing so merely for the sake of making political capital, I have no doubt that they will undertake the task willingly for the good of their country. Unfortunately there is no considerable source of revenue which can be.raised to replace opium revenue except an income tare which as opium revenue diminishes to disappearing point must be on a very high scale and must be a rreat handicap on the trade and develop-ment of a young country.42.    As I have al.rer.dy indicated, Hong Kong is in a vary different position financially and would
have no difficulty in replacing her opium revenue by additional taxation, however unpalatable an addition of S5fo to the ordinary taxation of the Colony, would be to the inhabitants.    But assuming that the British delegates will not be authorised to make any pronouncement of tho nature indicated^&apos; in the case of Malaya, it would in my opinion be most unwise to do so in the oase of Hong Kong as this would be bound to focus attention on Malaya,   iloreover, as I have already suggested, this question is not really relevant to the matter under consideration,   I urge therefore that the British delegates should not be authorised to raise this question at Geneva, end if it is raised by the delegates of any other country, they should deal with it on the lines indicated in paragraphs37 and 39 of this memorandum, pointing out also the fact that if the sale of opium were not in the hands of the Colonial Governments, the profits, whioh are at present expended for the good of the countries concerned, would go into the pockets of private individuals, 43.     In conclusion I submit that the line which the British delegates should be authorised to take at Geneva is as follows:-The object of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to bring the practice of opium smoking to an end as soon as pos ible in accordance with the &quot;Opium Convention&quot;. V.hen that convention was agreed to it was not foreseen that after a period of some yef.ro of improvement China would relapse into opium smoking and opium growing ,on
an immense soale.     It is clear that opium smoking cannot he brought to an end, until there is a stable Government in China whioh is willing and able first to reduce and then to suppress opium growing.In the meantime, in our possessions outside China in which there are large Chinese populations it is the strong opinion of our Governors and of practically all our high officials that far more evil than good would result from trying to prohibit and penalise the practice amongst Chinese.    The question therefore is how far an advance may be ms.de upon the present regulations for restriction.&quot;    These regulations should be enforced simultaneously and so far as possible uniformly in the Far astern dependencies of \7e-5tern Powers, and by Japan and Siam.Tho policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is not to pose a3 specially righteous by drastio action in our own Colonies only, nor is there any occasion for this country to how itself as specially sensitive to adverse criticism, or to court the approval of enthusiasts either in this country or in the United States of America.     -hat we want is to get other countries to go as far as we have gone and are prepared to go.     The case of our Colonies is that they cannot go further at present than they have shown their willingness to go.     tie are prepared to have this case examined by a delegation sent by the league of Hat ions to study the question in the Par Ba3t for (say) a year, visiting each country concerned.    Wo are prepared to accept delegates of other nationalities, (say) one of French and
one of American nationality, and our only stipulation is that the delegates selected should he entirely unbiased and have taken no side on this question.   I? other countries do not wish to contribute to the expense we are prepared to defray it from Hong Kong and Malayan revenues. i.&apos;hen the delegates have reported to the League of Ilations we are prepared to carry out, so far as possible, recoraiendations made by the League of Hations thereon provided that other countries concerned will also carry them out.This offers tho best chance of a real and nenoral improvement and is i submit in stridt accordance with &quot;a one hundred per cent League of nations policy&quot;.DM(Intd) J.II.T,Colonial Office, 31at July, 1924.-20-
