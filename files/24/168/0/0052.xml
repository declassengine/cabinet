[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]SECRET.CP. 450 (24).CABINET. Opium Policy.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.1. The Government of India (though their interests are involved) have no direct responsibility in regard to the measures to be adopted in British Colonies in the Far East for giving effect to Chapter 2 of the Hague Convention. If, as has been suggested by the Home Secretary, a policy of suppression after a fixed period were adopted, Indian exports to those Colonies would be reduced and would ultimately cease, and the Government of India would lose revenue. But as that Government have undertaken that no opium will be exported unless covered by a certificate issued by the importing Government that it is required for legitimate purposes, no objection could be taken by them. In so far, therefore, as Indian revenues would be affected by the adoption of a policy of suppression in British Colonies, it seems unnecessary to consult the Government of India as suggested in para. 7 of the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum.2. If a policy of. suppression be adopted in British Colonies, this decision would not, of course, apply to Burma. In that province opium administration is a transferred subject under the control of a Minister who has inherited what is believed to be the most effective system of control in the East, the policy having two objects, first the ultimate total prohibition of consumption by Burmans, and secondly the supply to non-Burmans who are already consumers of their legitimate minimum requirements. Each consumer is registered, and the amount of opium issued is fixed in the case of each individual. In the case of Burmans no new consumers are registered, so that within a reasonable time a policy of complete prohibition, so far as Burmans are concerned, will be established.3. With reference to para. 7 of the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum, I feel bound to enter a caveat against any assumption that the policy of India in respect of the export of opium must automatically and in all circumstances follow that adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Constitutionally, no doubt, His Majesty&apos;s Government could, through the Secretary of State for India, direct the Government of India to restrict or discontinue exports. But this doctrine is hardly applicable to the present case. For what we are now concerned with is an international Convention, for compliance with which India, as a full member of the League of Nations, is responsible just as Great Britain is. ft is accordingly to the League, and not to His Majesty&apos;s Government, that India is answerable for carrying out the obligations imposed on her by the Convention. During the past, few years India has been the object of a sustained and unfair attack, which she has successfully resisted, and it is now admitted by all but the most prejudiced that India is faithfully carrying out the prescriptions of the Convention. In the circumstances stated, I think it would be unreasonable that India should also be subjected to pressure or dictation by Great Britain. This is a doctrine which has been accepted in the case of other branches of the activities of the League. Moreover, there are some indications that public opinion of India, if left to itself, may favour the restriction or the stoppage of the opium export trade, although it is somewhat doubtful whether this movement is genuine or whether it is&apos; mainly political. However this may be, it is, in my view, probable that any attempt on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to dictate an opium policy to India would, in the present state of political feeling, be resented, and might tend to check the growth of any public opinion in favour of the restriction and prohibition of exports.If the proposal of the Home Secretary be not adopted this question will not arise, and even if that proposal be accepted the question would &quot;not arise for several years, as it is not suggested that a policy of complete suppression should be adopted at once. Nevertheless, I have thought it desirable to refer to the implication contained in the memorandum.4. For the information of my colleagues, I append a brief memorandum on opium consumption in India.OLIVIER.18th September 1924.
APPENDIX.Opium consumption in India,In India, apart from Burma (where consumption generally takes the form of smoking), opium is generally eaten in the form of pills or drunk in solution. The general attitude of the Government of India on the question of opium eating in India is described in the following extracts from a despatch of Lord Iiardinge&apos;s Government written in 1911 : &quot;The prohibition of opium eating in India we regard as impossible, and any attempt at it as fraught with the most serious consequences to the people and the Government. We take our stand unhesitatingly on the conclusion of the Royal Commission which reported in 1895, viz., that the opium habit as a vice scarcely exists in India, that opium is extensively used for non-medical and quasi-medical purposes, in some cases with benefit, and for the most part without injurious consequences; that the non-medical uses are so interwoven with the medical uses that it would not be practicable to draw a distinction between them in the distribution and sale of the drug ; and that it is not necessary that the growth of the poppy and the manufacture and sale of opium in British India should be prohibited except for medical purposes. Whatever may be the case in other countries, centuries of inherited experience have taught the people of India discretion in the use of the drug, and its misuse is a negligible feature in Indian life. Even if it were possible to suppress the cultivation of opium in India, geographical and political limitations would place it beyond our power to prevent illicit import and consumption on a serious scale.&quot;&quot; The great majority of Indian opium-eaters are not slaves to &quot;the habit. They take small closes as required, and can and do give up the allowance when the need of it is past. Opium is in virtually universal use throughout India as the commonest and most treasured of the household remedies accessible to the people. It is taken to avert or lessen fatigue, as a specific in bowel complaints, as a prophylactic against malaria (for which its relatively high anarcotine content makes it specially valuable), to lessen the quantity of sugar in diabetes, and generally to allay pain in sufferers of all ages. The vast bulk of the Indian population, it must be remembered, are strangers to the ministrations of qualified doctors or druggists. They are dependent almost entirely on the herbal simples of the country; distance and the patient acceptance of hardships standing in the way of prompt access to skilled medical relief In these circumstances the use of opium in small quantities is one of the most important aids in the treatment of cbilclren&apos;s sufferings. It is also a frequent help to the aged and infirm, and an alleviation in diseases and accidents which are accepted as incurable. To prevent the sale of opium except under regular medical prescription would be a mockery; to many millions it would be sheer inhumanity.&quot;The consumption of opium in India dates probably from the 16th century, and for the last 100 years the Government of India have, recognised that the practice is deeply rooted in the lives of the population, and that any attempt to eradicate it would be open to all the objections which can be urged against bureaucratic interference with traditional and widespread popular customs. It has consequently been the object of Government regulation to eliminate opportunities of over-indulgence and thus to restrict consumption to legitimate needs.The methods of regulation that have been adopted are as follows: The Opium Act, 1878, prohibits the manufacture, possession, transport, import, export and sale of opium except as permitted by rules framed under the Act, and provides for the confiscation of any opium in regard to which an offence is committed. Officers of the Excise, Police, Customs, Salt, Opium, and Revenue Departments of the proper rank, are given powers of search, seizure and detention. The production of opium is a Government monopoly, Practically the whole of the poppy required is grown in a particular area in the United Provinces and must be delivered to the Government Opium Department. It is then made up into balls or calces (&quot;provision&quot; opium) or cubical packets (&quot;excise&quot; opium) at the Government Factory, undergoing only such processes as are necsssary for standardisation and packing. Most of the &quot; provision &quot; opium is sold by the Government of India direct to the Governments of the countries which require it, and is covered by certificates from those Governments that it is required for legitimate purposes; the remainder is
sold by auction at Calcutta, but this also may not be exported except on the production of a certificate from the Government of the importing country that it is required for legitimate purposes. Excise opium is sold by the Central Government to local Governments at fixed prices, and these local Governments when become responsible for its distribution. The main provisions of the rules controlling distribution made by the different local Governments are uniform. Opium is issued only to licensed wholesale or retail vendors. The issue price is artificially high, and has been progressively raised with the object of restricting consumption without stimulating smuggling. The wholsale vendor may sell his opium only to other licensed vendors or to licensed druggists; the retail vendor and the licensed druggist may sell to individuals. Thus the individual can obtain opium produced in India only from a licensed retail vendor or a licensed druggist. Each stage of the distribution down to the retail vendor is safeguarded by an elaborate system of transport passes, while the conditions governing the licence of a retail vendor are most stringent; he may uot sell to any one person at one time more than the quantity of opium which an individual may lawfully possess ; he may sell only for cash and only on premises for which he is licensed ; he must not allow consumption on such premises, and he must keep correct daily accounts of his sales, which shall be open at all times to inspection by Excise officers. The number of licensed shops in an area is fixed so as not to exceed what is necessary to satisfy the moderate needs of legitimate consumers, and is constantly being reduced as improvements in communications or other changes in local circumstances render centralisation of supply more easy. The amount of opium of which an individual may be in possession varies according to circumstances in the different provinces, being either 180, 360 or 540 grains.Very stringent control is also exercised over the import of opium, and, generally speaking, it may be said that only licensed druggists and medical practitioners are permitted to import it.The system of control over the possession, transport, purchase and sale of opium has now been inherited in each province (except Assam) by the Minister who is in charge of the Excise Department and is responsible to the reformed Legislative Council of the province. During the four years that have now elapsed since excise administration has become a transferred subject, Indian Ministers have not, so far as I am informed, initiated any measures for the prohibition or stricter control of opium eating or for improvement of the existing machinery of control. It was announced at the Assembly of the League of Nations last year that, in the event of such further legislation being initiated in any province, it would undoubtedly receive support from the Government of India. The only province in which the subject is not transferred to Indian Ministers is Assam, and it is noteworthy that this is also the only province where steps have recently been taken (by the rationing of shops and by the registra-tion of opium eaters) for closer restriction, and even with a view to preparing the ground for prohibition if such a step should eventually be found practicable.Opium smoking, as opposed to opium eating, is not indigenous to India proper and is universally reprobated as a degrading vice. The Government of India suggested some time ago that smoking dens should be suppressed by making the assembly of three or more persons for the purpose of smoking opium a penal offence. Legislation on these lines has recently been introduced in the Central Provinces and in the Punjab.The Ail-India Congress Committee this year passed a resolution that the opium policy of the Government of India is contrary to the moral welfare of the people of India, and expressing the opinion that the people of India would welcome the total abolition of the opium traffic for purposes of revenue, and that the production of opium is out of all proportion to the medical requirements of India. It would seem, however, from the apparent indifference of Provincial Legislative Councils and responsible Indian Ministers to the subject of opium consumption during the last four years that Indian opinion is not in advance of the policy which they have inherited from the Government of India. Nor, until this year, has any attack been made on this policy by any of the Governments outside critics, who have been conducting a most vigorous campaign against the sale of alcoholic liquors.It is interesting to note that the annual consumption of opium per head of the population in India is nearlv constant. It was reported by the Royal Commission to be 27 grains per head in. 1892-93. It was 29 grains in 1903-04,31 in 1908-09, 30 in 1913-14, 28 in 1918-19 and 26 grains in 1919-20.
