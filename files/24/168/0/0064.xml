S 60WRKMENT),; c r b3 T,. 462 (24).C A 3 I 13 E T.PROPOSED VISIT OF A BRITISH ADMIRAL TO&quot; GREECEoMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,I circulate to ray colleagues the accompanying copy of a note from the Greek   Minister in which he requests that a British admiral may be sent to Greece to advise the Hellenic government on the re-organisation of their navy, In communicating this note to the Foreign Office the Greek Minister explained that the desire of hia government was that a British admiral of high authority and distinction might proceed for a few weeks to Greece in order to examine and advise on. their present naval situation:   the Greek government hoped thereafter to be again able to engage a permanent British naval mission similar to the successive British naval missions which had rendered such excellent service to the Greek government from 1911 until last year,.It is understood that an analogous request has been addressed to the French government in connection with the-re-organisation of the Greek army,, and that the French government have already acceded to tho request and have appointed General Gulllaumat for tho purpose.It can scarcely be doubted that the successive British naval missions which have been present in Greece since 1911 under the direction of Admirals Tufnell, Kerr, Palmer, Kelly&apos; and Aubrey Smith, have not only proved of great utility to, the Hellenic navy, but have been cf considerable advantage to British politics! and strategic interests,,     Since the
establishment of the republic in Greece, the French government have endeavoured and  re still endeavouring to bring that country within their ov/n orbit, and it is to be apprehended that if His fciajesty&apos;s Government were to refuse this present request the Greek government would apply to the French government for the expert naval advice of which they now stand in need0     Such a contingency would not only be generally undesirable but would also be particularly incon-venient at a moment when we are endeavouring to discourage these small states, from, all unnecessary armament programmes.! The French have already managed to induce the Greek government, in spite of our&apos; opposition, to purchase two submarines, and it is to be feared that if our influence in Greek naval matters is to be superseded by French influence, the Greek government will be encouraged to place further orders in France and build up a navy in excess of their actual needs. The presence of a British naval mission in Greece would go far to counter-act this dangerous tendency, and it is for this reason, if for no other, that I am inclined to accede to the Greek government&apos;s request,I should be grateful therefore if my colleagues would consider the matter in order that we may take an early occasion of discussing it in Cabinet and conveying our reply to the Greek government.     These intricate points cannot always be fitted into a universal and simple formula,(Intd,)     J.R.K..ign Office, S,W. September 30th, 1924,
