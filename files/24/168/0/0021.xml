document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s. Government).Lord Danesfort is asking in the House of Lords on Wednesday 50th July the following question.&quot;To ask the Lord President of the Council whether his attention has been called to the fact that, owing to the present state of the British Law of nationality and to recent legislation in the United States in 1929, a British born woman on marrying an American citizen loses her British Nationality and does not acquire United States citizenship, and is consequently sub-jected to serious hardships as regards passport and other matters and to many other disabilities;    and whether, in view of the fact that the recent Joint Select Committee of the House of Lords and House of Commons on the nationality of Harried Women were unanimously of opinion that a British-born woman shall not on marriage lose her British nationality if she does not acquire that of her husband under the law of his country, His Majesty&apos;s Government will, after consultation with the Dominions, introduce legislation at an early date to give effect to this unanimous opinion, without prejudice to the larger questions which have been raised as to the position of British and alien women respectively in regard to the retention and acquisition of&quot;British Nationality on their marriage.&quot;I attach a memorandum prepared in the Home Office from which it will be seen that I have been advised that the Government should not, in present circumstances at any rate, encourage legislation on the lines indicated, on the following grounds:-(l) The present principle of our law that the wife of a British subject is deemed to bo a British subject and the wife of an alien to be an alien has been maintained for the last 64&apos;. 419(24)CABINET.Nationality of Married Women.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.
years and the laws of most foreign countries embody the same principle. (S) After the whole subject had been deliberated by a Select Committee in 1922 and a Joint Select Committee in 1923,    without any agreed conclusion being arrived at it vas referred last yeo^r to the Imperial Conference which passed a resolution in favour of maintaining the present principle subject to power being taken to re-admit a woman to British Nationality in hard cases where the marriage though not legally dissolved was for practical purposes brought to an end.     In the face of this decision of the Imperial Conference - if for no other reason - it has been&apos; suggested to me that, the British Government ought not to adopt Lord Danesforfs suggestion.(5) The nationality of a person in&quot;contemplation of British law ought not, as Lord Danesforfs motion would have it, to be dependent on Foreign Lav;.(4) V/e ought not to abandon our principles merely becausethe new American law imposes hardships on some individuals; and as a matter of fact Lord. Danesforfs suggestion would tend to mahe the position worse by introducing uncertainty into the position of British born women who marry aliens.(5) Lord Danesfort&apos; exaggerates the hardship due to the American law, which has been partly mitigated by administrative arrangements; - in any case his proposal would not remove disabilities as to leave to land in the United Stater, of America as the woman would still be an &quot;alien1&apos; in American lav/.(C) The proposal has already been negatived by theGovernment in the House of Commons - nee for instance the Prime ;.i&apos;ini;:.ter&apos; s answer to KTs. Wintringham on i; 3rd rfarqb copy annexed.
On the other hand there has been considerable agitation on the part of certain women&apos;s organisations for a complete change in British law on this natter - much wider than Lord Danesforfs motion - and the House of Lords may show otrong sympathy with the motion.I shall be glad to know whether   my colleagLi.es consider that the Government representative must maintain rigidly that the motion cannot be accepted or whether he may be authorized if pressed to admit the possibility of further enquiry of the Dominions as to whether they are prepared in consultation with the Home Government to consider the point further.A. H.29 th July,  1924.
MEMORANDUM ON LORD DANESFORT&apos;S QUESTION FOR WEDNESDAY SOTH JULY.This is a shrewdly and judiciously drafted question which is designed to attract the sympathy of all reasonable people in favour of an amendment which, on the face of it, seems quite unobjectionable;   while at the same time the question attempts to avoid the controversy to which the &quot;larger questions&apos;&apos; have given rise in recent years.The proposal is that a British born woman shall not on marriage lose her British nationality if she does not acquire that: of her husband under the law of his country.     This point was raised before the Joint Select. Committee which considered the whole question in 1923 and the House of Lords Members of that Committee went out of their way to recommend that the law should be amended in this respeot, although their general conclusion was that there should be no general alteration of the law relating to the nationality of married women, (See Report of the Proceedings pp. xviii - xix).   Their recommendation was not confined to British born women as in the present proposal-The House of Commons Members of this Committee recommended a complete reversal of tho existing principle that the nationality of the wife shall follow that of her husband, and recommended in particular that a British woman shall not lose her British nationality by the mere act of   marriage with an alien.   The whole Committee may therefore in a sense be said (as Lord Danesfort suggests) to be unanimous on the present point.Under our law the general principle that the nationality of a married voman shall depend upon that of her husband has been main-tained for the past 64 years, and the present law is now expressed in Section 10 of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act,1914, as follows:-   &quot;The wife of a British subject shall be deemed to be a British subject and the wife of an alien shall be deemed to be an alien&quot;.   Broadly speaking the same principle has for many years been maintained in most foreign countries.   There has been considerable agitation in favour of altering this principle - which has b,een
closely allied with, the women&apos;s movement for the &quot;self determination&quot;. This has led to a careful examination of the subject first by a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1922 to whom was referred a Bill which had been introduced by Lord Danesfort (then Sir John Butcher), and subsequently in 1923 by the Joint Committee of both Houses to which reference has already been made.The deliberations of the earlier Committee, after it had heard a considerable amount of evidence, were brought to an end by the dissolution of Parliament,     The proceedingsjof the later Joint Committee, which are published, show that after hearing a great deal of evidence they were unable to agree upon a report, and the result must therefore be regarded as inconclusive except in so far as they can be said to have been unanimous on the point now under discussion.In these circumstances the opportunity was taken to bring the whole subject up for consideration by the Imperial Conference which met in October 1923 and it was referred to the Nationality sub-Committee of that Conference.     This Sub-Committee which had before them proceedings of the Joint Committee, passed a resolution, subsequently approved by the Conference, expressing the opinion that the principle of the existing law that the nationality of a married woman depends on that of her husband should be maintained.    The resolution recommended, however, one change in the law, viz, that power should be taken to re-admit a woman to British nationality in cases where -the married state though subsisting in law has to all practical purposes oome to an end (see Cmd 1987).   This recommendation followed upon special representations by the Commonwealth of Australia in che same dense.    Steps are now being taken to give effect to the latter part of this resolution and a Bill has been prepared and is being submitted to the Self Governing Dominions for their observations. In these circumstances it is Somewhat difficult vi.i_li_Y.iE. the Dominions arid apart from any other considerations to take up now the suggestion in Lord Danesfort&apos;s question which,though referred to in the Joint ommittee&apos;s proceedings which were laid before the imperial Conference, as not recommended in the resolution referred to above.
Apart from the above considerations the proposal in Lord Danesfort&apos;s question is superficially attractive for several reasons.   In particular the Cable Act of U.S.A, has drawn attention to the   inconvenience which results from tho loss of a woman&apos;b nationality by marriage without the acquisition of her husband&apos;s nationality and the present proposal might remove those inconveniences where they exist.     France and Belgium already have, and have had for some time,a law to the effect now proposed, and there is nothing bo far as we know to indicate that it has proved unsatisfactory.   At   the same time the last thing we want to do is to follow the nationality laws of other countries unless there is some very good reason for doing so;   nor do we want to bo driven into adopting a principle which is unsound because some other nation, e.g., the U.S.A., has made a change in its law which has produced inconvenience to individuals.Nationality law should be based upon good principle and not on mere convenience or incidental hardship.   A further criticism to be urged against Lord Danesforfs proposal is that it would tend to introduce uncertainty into the national status of British born women who marry aliens.   Under the present law such women are aliens, whether or. not they possess the husband nationality. If our law ia changed it will be necessary to enquire and ascertain in each case whether in fact the woman has acquired her husband&apos;S nationality.   This may not always be easy to establish definitely, and it is hardly right that the women&apos;s position should depend upon facts which may be quite uncertain or difficult to ascertain. Moreover, suppose, that the law, e.g., of U.S.A., is again changed (as is quite possible) so that a British woman marrying a citizen of U.S.A. after the date of the change will herself become a citizen of U.S.A., it is easy to imagine that difficulties may arise in ascertaining how the U.S.A.i law as so changed, Affects the position of the woman who married before the change came into operation.As regards Lord Danesforfs statement that by marriage to
an American citizen a British horn woman is subjected to &quot;serious hardships as regards passport and other matters, and to many other disabilities&quot;, this assertion seems to be an exaggeration of the actual facts so far as we know them.     It is true that difficulties have arisen in regard to the grant of facilities to enable such women to travel and in a few instances the wife has actually been refused leave to land in U..S.A.     The passport difficulty has, however, teen largely obviated by arrangements made ir th the U.S.A., authorities and though the position cannot be regarded as   -satisfactory, it can hardly be said that in this respect any real hardship is imposed on the women concerned.   The danger of the wife being refused leave to land in America would remain even if she retained her British nationality.    It is not known exactly to what &quot;disabilities&quot; Lord Danesfort refers, but in so far as they relate to disabilities such as disqualification of aliens to exercise the&apos;franchise in this country it is to be remembered that in most cases the wife is or will be resident with her husband in U.S.A., and would not be in a position to qualify for a vote even if she were a British subject, and eligible as such for the franchise.In view of the above considerations it is submitted that it would be nei ther expedient nor right that the Government, in present circumstances at any rate, should encourage the proposal to introduce legislation on the linos indicated by Lord Danesfort.
DAILY DEBATES   .3.5.261 Oral Answer.57. Mrs.WIHTRI1TGHAK asked the Prime Minister whether, in view of the labours of the Select Committee on the nationality of Married Women and of the amount of valuable evidence taken, he can allow an opportunity either for the introduction of legislation or for the setting up of a further Committee to consider the matter during this Session?The PRIME MINISTER:   In view of the fact that the Committee referred to failed to arrive at a conclusion and that the Imperial Conference of last autumn, who had the Committee^ Report before them, came to the conclusion that no case was made out for any general change of the law on this subject, there seems to be no advantage in initiating further enquiry at the- moment and no possibility of legislation other than that recommended by the Conference&quot; for the purpose of dealing with certain hard cases.Mrs. WINTR1NGHAM: Is the Prime Minister aware that all the Members of the House of Commons who were on this Committee were unanimous that legislation was important?The PRIME MINISTER:    If I were convinced that anything could be done, 1 would be perfectly willing to try to do it. I look at this question not from the point of view of what 1 would like to do, but from the point of view of what I might find myself limited in doing.
