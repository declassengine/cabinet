printed for the Cabinet.   November 1924.....XOXFipEXTTAL.&apos;24)) 4iRANCE AND THE GENEVA PEOTOCOL.I CIRCULATE this Foreign Office memorandum to the Cabinet for information only at this stage. I am naturally not yet in a position to make any proposals to my colleagues.Foreign Office, November 9,1924.[C 16913/2048/18]Memorandum on the Necessity of the Early Consideration of the Question ofFrench Security.WITH the advent to power of a new Government it is necessary to draw attention to one question which, though temporarily dormant, is certain to be raised in the very near future, and which is likely to be one of the most important, if not the most important, issue in foreign politics with which the new Government will have to deal.   This is the question of French security.Anglo-French relations in Europe have in the main, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Versailles, turned on three great questions the settlement of reparations, the settlement of inter-Allied debts and the settlement of security. All these questions were so interwoven that for a long time it seemed impossible to settle any of them. The method of isolating each and settling one at a time seems likely, however, to bear fruit. The application of the Dawes plan promises the settlement of the reparation question. But in the improved atmosphere which has resulted from- the application of this plan the other two problems must not be forgotten. It was only with the greatest difficulty that His Majesty&apos;s Government held out for the entire elimination of such questions from the discussion of the Dawes plan, and it is certain that the French only consented to this unwelcome method of procedure on the understanding that once the Dawes plan was put into operation discussions about debt and security would begin.Discussion of the inter-Allied debt question may easily result eventually from the present meeting of financial experts who are considering the distribution of German payments obtained both during the Ruhr period and under the Dawes Report. This meeting is expected to lead shortly to a meeting of Allied Finance Ministers.There remains security. To the French this is the crucial question. While reparations and debts may loom large from time to time, security is always present in the French mind, and until this problem is solved it will react as before on other problems and make them insoluble, and a real return to normal and peaceful con-ditions will be as far off as ever.It is impossible, therefore, for a Government whose object is to restore stability all round and encourage conditions in which trade can prosper not to take this question into very early consideration.Apart from this general reason, His Majesty&apos;s Government, while not legally bound, are at least morally bound to see whether some satisfactory solution cannot be reached. For, whatever views may be held about the desirability or otherwise of giving a pact of guarantee to France&quot;, there can be no doubt that a great proportion of the trouble of the past five years is traceable to the failure to implement the guarantee treaties signed by this country and the United States and attached to the Treaty of Versailles.We are, moreover, under an obligation to discuss the question in the near future a.

with the French Government. At Chequers on the 21st and 22nd June last M. Herriot definitely asked whether, after a settlement on the basis of the Dawes Report, Great Britain would study a pact of mutual guarantee. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald explained the difficulties in the way of such a pact. At the same time, he expressed his willingness to explore the whole question as soon as the Dawes Report was out of the way. &quot; Let us settle first,&quot; he said, &quot; the question of the Dawes Report; then we will go on to that of inter-Allied debts, then to the problem of security.&quot; Security was again discussed at Paris on the 8th and 9th July at some length. The question was found to be too vast to settle in so short a conversation, and the Prime Minister, therefore, suggested that the French Government should send a note to His Majesty&apos;s Government, to which the latter would reply, and the question could then be taken up again at a future conference or conversation. The position as it was then left by the two Prime Ministers was set out in the Franco-British memorandum of the 9th July concerning the application of the Dawes plan. The relevant paragraph read as follows : &quot; The two Governments have likewise proceeded to a preliminary exchange of views on the question of security. They are aware that public opinion requires pacification; they agree to co-operate in devising through the League of Nations or otherwise, as opportunity presents itself, means of securing this and to continue the consideration of the question until the problem of general security can be finally solved.&quot;The subject was not discussed during the London Conference in August, but on the 11th August M. Herriot, following on Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s invitation recorded above, submitted a note putting forward the views of the French Govern-nient on the question. No detailed answer has yet been returned to that note, which is at present before the Committee of Imperial Defence, The comments of the War Office on the French views have also been addressed to the Committee of Imperial Defence; those of the Admiralty and Air Ministry are still awaited.Meanwhile, the results of the assembly of the League of Nations in September have cut across the situation. Whether it is possible for the Geneva Protocol to be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government and whether, if the Geneva Protocol is generally accepted by the present members of the League, French security can be regarded as adequately safeguarded, are questions which this department is not in a position to answer; nor is it the object of this note to discuss them. Its object is simply to draw attention to the fact that if the Geneva Protocol falls through, or if its acceptance by the present members of the League cannot be said to be an adequate safeguard of French security, the whole question of French security will be reopened; and if we do not show the French that we are still prepared to consider it with every desire to reach a satisfactory solution, we may expect renewed accusations-tions of bad faith from France, with a consequent deterioration of Anglo-French relations and a possible renewal of the nightmarish happenings of the past five years.An extract from Paris despatch No. 1893 of the 29th August, 1924, which bears on this point, is attached.Central Department, Foreign Office, November 4, 1924.Extract from Paris Despatch No. 1893 of Augwst 29, 1924.THE majorities who voted, their confidence in M. Herriot in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies respectively over the London agreements undoubtedly expect from Great Britain certain satisfactions in regard to (a) security and (6) inter-Allied debts. If, as the result of your approaching meeting with M. Herriot at Geneva, and of the future meeting of the Allied Finance Ministers in Paris, these expectations should be disappointed, the existence of the Entente will, I fear, be gravely threatened.9. France may quite conceivably, in that unfortunate eventuality, decide upon one of the two following courses: (a.) She may, by the gradual process of Ministries formed more and more towards the Right, revert to the old poincare policy of constraint and reliance upon what, after all, if her alliances with the Petite Entente be included, constitutes her at present overwhelming military force; or
(o.) And this appears at any rate for the near future to be most probable, she may either under M. Herriot, M. Briand or some other President of the Council chosen from the Left, decide, regretfully perhaps, to throw in her lot more and more with Germany, and to conclude with that Power close commercial agreements which, by a species of Franco-German industrial combine, may prove highly injurious to British interests.10. How far it may be within the power of His Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent either of the two unfortunate results above referred to from materialising it is difficult to say, but it might perhaps be possible for Great Britain to make certain concessions to France over debts, and to obtain in return a solemn and binding undertaking in regard to any possible commercial arrangement to be come to in the future between France and Germany, and in regard to granting the most favourable treatment possible to British goods under the future revised customs tariff.
