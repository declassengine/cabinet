[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma]&apos;esty&apos;s Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1924.) SECRET. hlmda ;-&apos;v^&apos;l&apos;CP. 448(24).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.The papers which have been circulated to the Cabinet, closing with my telegram to the Viceroy of the 17th instant, drafted at the meeting of the Cabinet Sub-Committee of 16th instant and my letter to and reply from the Prime Minister, will have put Members in possession of the developments since the Cabinet meeting of the 30th July in regard to the assumption by the Government of India of special powers to deal with conspiracies for violence.The question on which there has been some division of opinion in the Cabinet Committee was whether immediate authority should be given to the Government of India to take, if it considered that necessity had. actually arisen, special measures for forestalling and preventing criminal action or whether such authority should be deferred in accordance with the opinion formulated by Mr. Trevelyan that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready to consider a measure intended to give the Government of India powers to search for arms and explosives, assent to the enactment of a Crimes Ordinance should not be given unless accompanied by some definite act which would make it clear to the Indian people that His Majesty&apos;s present Government are ready to co-operate with them in working for Indian self-government, and that no assent should be given to the Ordinance without the authority of the Prime Minister and Cabinet after consideration of the concurrent policy of conciliation.The Prime Minister deemed it advisable that the telegram proposed should be sent without waiting for the fulfilment of this condition, the possibility of complying with which I now desire to discuss.Mr. Trevelyan, and with him Colonel Wedgwood, insist upon the importance of &quot; some definite act &quot; as distinct from the repeated assurances which have been given by the Prime Minister and myself of -the desire and intention of the present Govern-ment to co-operate with the reform parties in working for Indian self-government.His Majesty&apos;s Government have in fact taken such action as it has been deemed practicable to take. They did desire to take more definite action, namely, to arrange a conference between Indian political leaders and selected representatives of British political parties, but this course was opposed by the Viceroy, and was abandoned.In the meantime the Committee of Inquiry into the practical working of the existing transitional constitution, which was authorised to be set up in February last, has been established and is proceeding with its work. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have repeatedly urged upon the Viceroy the necessity for despatch in getting through the work of this Committee, but the Viceroy&apos;s latest letter to me insists that its work has been conducted with the-utmost possible despatch, but that it cannot make its report before the beginning of November (see note A. below).ITote A, Extract from Private Letter from Lord Reading to Lord Olivier, dated 28th August 1924.3. The Reforms Enquiry Committee is pursuing its labours, and is, I think, getting testimony which will have to be weighed and may be of use. It is not entirely one-sided, as the newspapers would seem to indicate particularly the extremist Press. I have already written to you fairly fully regarding the probable duration of the enquiry and the date when the Report will be presented to me. Meanwhile, I am keeping myself fully acquainted with all that is happening in the Committee from day to day.. I have also written to you confidentially my views regarding a visit by me to England for the purpose of conferring with you and the Cabinet. I feel more strongly than ever that it would be desirable, if not essential, before we can arrive at conclusions regarding the immediate future, to say nothing of a more remote period. Again, however, I must repeat that I see practically no prospect of being able to do it this year. As I have already indicated, the Report can scarcely be ready before November, and even that is rather sanguine. Yon may think at home that the pace is slow, but that is not a fair view. The. Committee is sitting daily, is working very hard, and has much material to digest. Although I am fully with you that no time should be lost, I am satisfied that it would be wrong to hurry the Committee. These constitutional questions do not lend themselves to hasty decisions. The problems require much probing, and any suggested remedies must be viewed from all angles. It is for this reason among others that I see little prospect of my return this year. But I shall be only too glad to take the opportunity of returning as early as possible in the next year and of conferring with you. That conference and discussion between us would be invaluable has always been my conviction as you are aware, but frankly I see little use in it except with those who are directly charged with the responsibility of policy. It would be futile to discuss India with reservations in one&apos;s mind. I should desire to speak with the utmost frankness to the Prime Minister and you and the Cabinet, and it is only thus that we could arrive at satisfactory conclusions. I agree entirely with you that we can scarcely hope to arrive at a mutual understanding on so important and perplexing a series of problems by means of letters, despatches and telegrams. Of one thing you may rest assured, that I am only too eager to find legitimate opportunity for returning home and of presenting my views. The answer to the suggestion made by you is contained in the views I have above expressed.
That such delay should be inevitable might be regarded as in itself an indication that the Government of India is not a very efficient organ for the conduct of political affairs, but, having regard to the conditions involved in the administration of that sub-continent and the intercurrence of other public business (sessions of the Assembly, &amp;c), it must perhaps be recognised that such delay has been unavoidable. The Viceroy assures me that it has been so, although earlier in the year he had expressed the hope that the Committee might conclude its labours this month.Meanwhile the spokesmen of all sections of the political reformist parties in India have expressed their conviction that the present constitution is unacceptable to them and cannot be worked satisfactorily, and that some overt act, indicating that His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to take steps to reform, it, is necessary.His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, are not, I consider, in a position to accept, in anticipation of the findings of the Committee of Enquiry and of its endorsement by the Viceroy, the proposition that the present constitution has proved unworkable. I confess that I have myself formed views upon that subject after discussing it with between 200 and 300 representatives of all shades of opinion in India, but 1 am not prepared to propound those views as a conclusive ground for immediate action.The salient troublesome facts with regard to political affairs in India which are brought to public notice in Press telegrams and in current discussions are local facts, and in considering their importance it is desirable to use a large-scale mental map. For example, in the Indian Legislative Assembly, consisting of 145 members, of whom 26, including the President, are officials, 14 nominated unofiicials, and 105 elected, only 41 were returned as Swarajists, with whom 12 others classed as Independents, Sikhs and Burmans may generally be expected to work. The balance of. the majorities against the Government have been floaters and opportunists. The case of Bengal is analogous, in which, out of 114 elected seats only 37 are returned as Swarajists and 13 as Independents, the balance of the narrow majorities being composed of voters temporarily bought or intimidated or voting with the Swarajists on such special issues as that of the Vote for Ministers&apos; salaries, which was rejected, as the Government admit, on grounds of the personal unsuitability of the Ministers.The position is much the same, in the United Provinces. In no other &quot;Provincial Council can the Swarajist Party pull majorities.Further, whilst a great deal is made of the clanger of terrorist revolutionism in India, this danger, as Lord Chelmsford pointed out at a previous Cabinet Meeting, is practically peculiar to Bengal, although at one time it took shape at Bombay, especially at Poona.   There may be possibilities of it in the Punjab.There is a constant tendency to identify not only the Swarajist political Party, but the whole of the progressive movement in India with the Bengal terrorist organisations and their conspiracies. The document on page 19 of the Blue Paper (CP. 446/21), which is described as &quot;Brief for use in Council or Parliament,&quot; and which, since it is so called, it is hardly unfair to describe as tendentious, labours this suggestion. It does not cite evidence, but states that &quot; it is common knowledge now that the Sirajganj resolution was the result of an agreement between the revolutionaries and the Swaraj Party.&quot; I have never been able to get from the Government of India anything more definite in support of this than that it was the result of an agreement between Mr. C. R. Das himself and the revolutionaries. Moreover, the only &quot; party &quot; concerned in that resolution was the Bengal Provincial Conference not the all-India Swaraj Party. I do not, therefore, consider that we have evidence to justify saying that &quot; the Swaraj Party &quot; is a party to any such agreement. In fact, Lord Reading, in a private letter, dated 21st August last (see Note B. below), has said expressly that he did &quot; not at present see any evidence of co-operation by the Swaraj Party as a whole or by its acknowledged leaders, other than Mr. C. R. Das, with the revolutionary movement.&quot; We are not, therefore, entitled to identify the &quot; Swaraj &quot; political Party with the Bengal outrage conspiracies, although I feel bound to give weight to the note B. Extract from private letter from Viceroy, dated 21st August 1924. 8. In para. 8 of your letter, after referring to the reports of the association of O. R. Das with the Bengal revolutionaries, you ask whether I have any reason to believe that such association lias spread, or is likely to spread, beyond Bengal. I find it difficult to answer as to the future, hut I have already indicated that I do not at present see any evidence of co-operation by tho Swaraj Party as a, whole, or by its acknowledged leaders, other than C. R. Has, with the revolutionary movement. Neither do I believe that the Swaraj Party as a whole lias at present any association with the Bengal revolutionary movement; but I am not prepared to say that I feel certain that this condition may not bo changed ; if it does, we shall become aware of it, and I shall advise you. All I can say is, that there is nothing to indicate that it has yet happened, and in my opinion it has not yet taken place.
cj. ij) Orepeated indication by Lord Lytton and the Viceroy of their conviction that Mr. C. R. Das-entered into the compact referred to on the &quot;Sirajganj resolution,&quot; and that Mr. Das-has caused funds to be placed at the disposal of the revolutionaries. I must, however, repeat that evidence of this, or that such funds were official Swaraj Party funds, has not yet been sent me; it appears, so far as the papers circulated show, to be only inference, and the possibility that the Bengal murder societies may have been supplied with funds provided by the Third International through Mr. M. N. Roy (who incited the Oawnpore revolutionaries recently tried), or otherwise, cannot be excluded.Still more unjustifiable would it be to allege that the majority of Indian progressive politicians or of Indian public opinion outside the Swaraj Party approve the physical force programme. The Sirajganj resolution has created violent schism in the Congress, and Mr. Gandhi has vehemently denounced it.On the other hand it is, I have no doubt, part of Mr. Dass policy to frighten us with the threat that, unless the demands which he makes on behalf of the Swarajist Party are forthwith complied with, outrages will occur. It is also the opinion of such Moderates as Mr. Sastri, Dr. Besant, and many other Indians who visited England this summer, that, unless some progressive move is shortly made, this is likely to happen..$ But I consider that it would be a very great mistake, even if I thought it politically justifiable, to act as though Mr. Das and the Swaraj Party held in one hand a constitutional scheme aud in the other hand the threat of outrage, and to say to them : &quot; We will repress your outrage, but at the same time we feel bound in compensation to accept your political scheme.&quot;The outrage conspiracies must be dealt with on their own merits and in their own genre, and it is the question of how to deal with these that we have in the last fortnight been concerned with. The Government of India believe that, if the-special powers now asked are given to it, the efficiency of the outrage movement will be scotched as it was scotched by the use of similar powers at a previous outbreak.I think it desirable to notice what appears to me a significant characteristic in the Bengal Governments attitude towards the presentation of this case.The two Bengal murder societies are-anarchist, terrorist organisations, aiming at destroying the executive machinery of Government, primarily by killing police officers and Government servants. These societies first became active in the agitation against the partition of Bengal. They are irreconcilably anti-British. Up to quite recently, their lately revived activities, as reported to us, have appeared merely as a vendetta aimed at killing Mr. Tegart, the Bengal Chief of Police, in reprisal for his having secured the conviction of some of their members. Later outrages have been aimed at supposed traitors in their own ranks.The Indian Swaraj political Party has a totally distinct origin and history. &quot; Swaraj &quot; means simply self-government, and all Indian progressive politicians are in that sense &quot;Swarajists.&quot; Tho Swaraj political Party is, however, a particular section of the reformist movement which has its own organisation and policy. Its declared political method has been non-co-operation. It is &quot; revolutionaiy,&quot; as the-&quot;Congress movement &quot;has always been, from the point of view of the established bureaucracy, in that it aims at changing the form of Government into an Indian national democracy. His Majesty&apos;s present Government and previous Governments have desired, and desire themselves, to promote this aim. Recently Mr. C. R. Das, the leader of the Indian Swaraj Party and more particularly the leader in Bengal politics, has, we are informed, joined hands with the Bengal anarchist terrorist organisation, tie has given, in the extracts from an interview, quoted on page 26 of CP. 446/24, his own account of his attitude towards those organisations. We are assured that his association is much closer. But from the basis of this particular contact, the evidence for which is itself extremely shadowy (although I am not prepared to contest the Government of India&apos;s belief that it exists), the programme of the Bengal Government and the Government of India expands into a demand for means of suppressing, not an anarchist outrage movement,&apos;but political &quot; movements.&quot; This fact impressed the Sub-Committee of Cabinet in the wording of the draft Ordinance submitted, the final form of which only reached the India Office on the morning of the 16th instant, just before the Sub-Committee met.The Government of Bengal may have believed that they were only asking for powers to suppress crimes of violence, but the habitual sub-conscious propensity of the Indian public service to regard all political reforming activity as a. source of public clanger emerges in the form of the provision which they submit, and whioh our telegramw*nw*ii-?i&apos;,ir&quot;&apos;-,i;-:&quot;!&apos;[&apos;:...
:-of the .17th instant demurred to, as follows : (Section 12.) &quot; Where, in the opinioivof ,,the local Government, there are reasonable grounds for believing that any person lias acted, is acting, or is about to act, in furtherance of any movement the object of which is to subvert the Government established by law in British India or any part thereof or to disturb by violence the public safety or tranquillity,..the local Government may&quot; &amp;c. (exercise the special powers conferred by the Ordinance). This is the Bengal Governments idea, uncorrected by the Government of India, of what constitutes anarchical crime, calling for special powers of repression. The Morning Post could hardly have improved on the simplicity of the definition.. It is difficult to conceive anything more disastrous than the effect the promulgation of such an Ordinance would have had on public opinion in India. Any politician or anyone convening a public meeting for the purpose of advocating changes in the Government could be proceeded against under this section, and although it may not have been the intention of the framers of the clause that any such course should be taken, it is obvious that this intention would immediately have been imputed to them by every Indian newspaper and progressive politician.This persistent sub-conscious habit of Indian public officials of regarding any political movement as seditious and treasonable and accordingly dangerous to the public peace and provocative of a tendency to outrage, is one very strong cause amoug others of the difficulty which we have in persuading Indian politicians of our good faith in the reforms and of the recrudescence of the irreconcilable anti-British anarchist movement.Prolongation of the present political status quo will, I believe, do two things: (1) It will feed the springs of the terrorist movement even if the activities of that movement may be temporarily or even for a prolonged period held in check by such measures as are now proposed, and (2) it will, as I forecast in my first memorandum to the Cabinet on Indian questions, and as I have had since then additional reasons for feeling confident, greatly reinforce the Swarajist polls and the election of Swarajist members to the Assembly and the Councils when next the constituencies are consulted. This reinforcement will be to some extent stimulated by the conflict of opinion connected with the Lee Commission Report. The Lee Commission was appointed in the teeth of the will, of the majority of the Legislative Assembly, including the Independents and Moderates. The Assembly, last week, declined by a considerable majority to approve its recommendations. The Council of State has indeed approved those recommendations without a division, and I have no doubt that the Viceroy will recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to take the necessary action to implement its recommendations. Such action will be likely to aggravate the difficulties of the Government in the January session of the Legislative Assembly.I gather from Lord Reading&apos;s private letters that he does not see his way to come home to confer with His Majesty&apos;s Government until after that meeting of the Assembly say in March next if then (see Note A. at foot of page 1).Colonel Wedgwood has suggested that the Viceroy should be invited to instruct the Governors of Bengal and the Central Provinces to offer the Swaraj Party a fresh opportunity of accepting ministerial responsibility under the transitional constitution. Prom one point of view this might be simpler in Bengal than in the Central Provinces. In Bengal the Swaraj Party have put themselves on sound constitutional ground. They have withdrawn from their policy of crippling services and have voted the supplies they originally refused for Education and Medical Service. On the other hand they have refused to vote salaries for Ministers largely, in substance, on the ground that they disapproved of the personalities of the Ministers who had been appointed, as non-representative men of straw. My opinion is that this ground is well founded. It is possible that their vote might be regarded as a protest against the constitution, but this line does not seem to have been taken in the debate so that, as far as I can judge, it is not impossible that Mr. Das might accept office if offered to him, though I think it improbable that he wrould do so. On the other hand it seems to me impossible to suggest to the Viceroy that he should make this offer to Mr. Das, both because he has told us that Mr. Das has been fomenting and financing outrage and because it would encourage the belief of Mr. Das that he has only to mobilise threats of outrage to bring the Government to his feet and would have a deplorable effect on constitutional reforming opinion in India.Mr. Das&apos;s own attitude, so far as can be gathered from the telegrams, is that he will proceed with his wrecking policy in the Councils, assisted by an outrage policy underground, until the Government accede to his demand that he and his friends should formulate a new constitution.
The Government of India can be carried on under the powers reserved in the -existing constitution. It is being now so carried on in Bengal and the Central Provinces. Lord Lytton seems to think it possible that it might be carried on in Bengal by fresh Ministers other than Mr. Das. It does not appear possible to expect that in the Central Provinces fresh Ministers would accept office or have their salaries voted for them. It must not (as I have already suggested) be supposed from the salience in the public eye of the Bengal conspiracy of the political difficulty in the Central Provinces, and of the like difficulty (which Lord Lytton seems to think he can steer through) in Bengal, that all. India is on the brink of revolution. Nor, so far as I can judge from all the witnesses I have consulted, is there any serious clanger of the Government being placed in real difficulties by any sort of no-taix agitation. It must be remembered that, largely owing to Mr. Das&apos;s own vagaries, the Congress Parties are in a very much greater state of division than they were a year ago. All these considerations incline the Government of India to believe that they can safely play for time. AVe do not want to play for time. Our time as a Government may not be very long and we do not believe that playing for time is a safe and effectual policy with regard to Indian affairs. We believe that it persistently aggravates the irreconcilable movement against British administration, -or administration partially British, in India. I am, therefore, entirely at one with Colonel Wedgwood and Mr. Trevelyan in recognising at least the desirability of making any such overt move as may be advisable as quickly as possible. The only question in my mind is whether we can make any really advisable move before we have had the Report of the Constitutional Inquiry Committee.Any such move will, I think, probably have to take the form of the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry and Review, with a view to the redress of grievances; such grievances being indicated (1) by the increasing tendency to violent outrage, which must at least be indicated as an inflamed symptom of a real and persistent cause of dissatisfaction; (2) the increasing opposition between the Government and the Elected Members of the Legislative Assembly, as evidenced in the proceedings of last February and the debates on the Lee Commission Report.In view of. the unanimous acceptance of that Report by the Council of State, and of the issues on which it was rejected in the Assembly (on which I have not yet had the Viceroy&apos;s full reports), this antagonism does in fact appear to me to present less disquieting features than I had feared it might do; the principal line of attack having been that the Lee Commission Report did not provide for sufficiently rapid Indianisation of the services or for sufficiently democratic control of them.We may, if the Viceroy does not again disappoint us, expect the Report on the Constitutional Enquiry within two months. We could not expect to mature, in agreement with the Government of India, any entirely new departure in anticipation of that Report very much within the same period. Much, therefore, as I should desire to be able to do so, I cannot recommend anything that would pass muster as a &quot; definite act&quot; of advance towards liberalisation of the constitution until we shall have received that Report.As distinct from such &quot; definite act,&quot; the only thing that can be done would be, if the proposed crimes legislation should be brought into force, that the Prime Minister should in Parliament repeat the assurance which he has already given and point out the course that we are taking towards the end in view.OLIVIER.17th September 1924.Note. I beg leave to take this opportunity, for the guidance of such of my colleagues as read only the Morning Post, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, and have no time for the House of Lords Official Reports, to inform them that it is not the fact that I have described Mr. Das as a saintly person or defended political assassination; so that, if in any public meeting anarchist sympathies are imputed to them on my account, they may simply reply that any statements that I have -done so are falsehoods.
APPENDIX.1. Telegram from Prime Minister to Lord Olivier, dated lQth September 192-1.I agree telegram. Am in London Sunday, unless you think I should arrive-earlier. Cabinet might meet Monday morning if no change in situation. I authorise you to arrange meeting with Hankey.. Shall pass through Fort William Wednesday noon, and shall call post office there for telegrams.2. Telegram from Lord Olivier to Prime Minister, dated 16th September 1924 Telegram received.   Have sent telegram as approved.   I think Cabinet Monday morning desirable and sufficient; will so inform Hankey.   Will circulate memorandum.3. Telegram from Secretary of Slate to Viceroy, Home Department, dated 17th September 1924;Secret. In reply to your telegram 3076 D, dated 10th September. In view of deficiencies in ordinary law, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to authorise enactment of legislation, or, if required, issue of Ordinance giving ample powers, including search, arrest, temporary imprisonment or segtegation, intended to prevent crimes of violence, where breaches of Explosives or Arms Acts or definite concerting or attempting physical violence to or assassination of any person whatever are suspected. But they must exclude from scope of legislation mere sedition or pro-yoking class enmity or other offences consistent with exclusively political action.They therefore object to the provision of section 12 enabling the Governor to use powers against persons acting &quot; in furtherance of any movement the object of which is to subvert the Government or to disturb by violence the public safety or tran-quillity,&quot; which they consider far too wide. This part- of section 12 should, in their opinion, run &quot; is about to act in breach of the Explosives Substances Act or Arms Act, or is definitely concerting or attempting [or conspiring to&quot;8&apos;] attempt physical violence, murder or assassination&quot; in lieu of words &quot; in furtherance &quot; down to &quot; tranquillity,&quot; and in following sections of draft Ordinance they would substitute &quot; offence &quot; for &quot; movement&quot; (of the nature described in section 12). Similar changes of wording will be necessary in clauses 15, 18, 19, Schedule (2) and possibly elsewhere.4. Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 17th September 1924. Private and personal. Your telegram of 11th instant. I am sending official telegram after consultation with Cabinet Committee and Prime Minister. You will appreciate absolute requirement that it should not be left to appear open to Government to use power under Ordinance as a means of interfering with proceedings deemed seditious, treasonable, or otherwise disturbing to the public peace as generally understood, but that Ordinance is intended solely to give powers effectually to prevent commission of outrage, violence or murder against individuals by whatever methods. Cabinet meets Monday further to consider Indian situation.5. Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, dated 11th September 1924.3137 D. Secret. Correspondence ending with (corrupt group). Revolutionaries. Following telegram, 5014 P.D., dated 14th September, received from the Government of Bengal: &quot; Latest information indicates intention of the revolutionists to attack the less important police officers and relations as soon as the Mirzapur Street bomb case is disposed of, and we should be in a position to strike immediately case terminates. Case is fixed for 15th September, and will not last long. Further information regarding the date of the promulgation of the Ordinance will be telegraphed. Some reports subsequent to letter .1360 P.D.,f dated 1st September, have been comnumi-cated direct by Police to D.I.B., Simla. Urgent orders requested regarding modifications in the Ordinance suggested by our telegram of 5th September, 1402 ?.D.&quot;t* These words added on recommendation of the Council of India with the approval of the Prime Minister. O. ^ ...t This is the letter summarised in the Government of India&apos;s telegram No. 3067 D, dated men September 1924 (page 27 of CP. 446/24).X Not repeated to India Office.
