This Document is the property of His Britannia Majesty1.s Government.Disarmament and Arbitration protocol,Memorandum by the First lord of the Admiralty.As my Colleagues know, I have been greatly exercisedprotocol for ths pacific Settlement of International Disputes, and I placed before them a Memorandum dealing more specifically with the Naval aspect of the protocol (CP.456/24).That Memorandum was drawn before the oxaet terms cf the prctoool were in my hands, but I regard it still assubstantially correctoI should like now to deal more generally with that document, and I do so not from any hostility to its basic principles, but from a sincere desire tc secure that we do not put our hands to an agreement whioh may promote disputes rather than ensu*e peaoe, and may from its ambiguities prove to be a source of contention in the future.My remarks will fall under two main hoads0   First, the grave foar which I entortain that a substantial difference of opinion may arise between the Mother Country and the Dominions over the terms of the protocol, and that the UoSsA. may on like issues be further alienated from the league of Nations.Secondly, that, as the history of the Irish Treaty&apos; shows, it is essential to be precise, and that the protocolSECRET.cab i i e i.Oop.478/24us Eirst Lord of the Admiralty over the previsions of theas
as at present drawn is full of ambiguities./, I take it that it had always been understood, prior to the drafting of the Protocol that if&quot;it was foimd that a dispute &quot;arose out of a matter which by international law was solely within the domestic jurisdiction of one party,&quot; further action by tho Council was estopped-In the opinion of the Commission of Jurists on the Janina-Corfu affair in roply to question 3 which read as follows&quot;Is an objection founded on Article 15, paragraph &quot;8, of the Covenant the only objection based cn the &quot;merits of a dispute on which the competence of the &quot;Council to make an enquiry oan be challenged,,&quot;The answer was&quot;Where a dispute likely to lead to a rupture is &quot;submitted to the Council on the application of one of &quot;the parties, in accordance with the provisions of &quot;Article 15, paragraph. 1, the case contemplated in &quot;paragraph 8 of Article 15, is the only case in which &quot;tho Counoil is not to enquire into the dispnte,&quot;As the result of the Japanese amendments to articles 4 and 5 of the protocol at tho ond of the reoenti-aneva discussions, it emerges that even after a decision has been given that a dispute arises out of a matter which issolely within the domestic jurisdl.jurisdiction.on of one party, theGouncil may ta&quot;&apos;e action under irt:; .le 11 of the Covenant,presumably conciliatory action,&apos; The important fact is that certain of theDominions strongly obj?ct to a domestic question, such as their national immigration policy, being submitted directly or indirectly to the consideration of the Council of theLeague, whether it is to secure pacific settlement of a dispute or not; and for this reason it appears not improbable that they may refuse to aoeept the protocol.The
Tho argument lias been employed that- there is. a close connection between paragraph 8 of Article 15 of the Covenant and Article 11 of the Covenant, though, as far as I know, the operation of Article 11 of the Covenant in such a connection has either been overlooked or at least never emphasised in the past.    It seems to me possible that certain of the Dominions may reject this interpretation of the Covenant. with the result that they will not only refuse to accept the protocol, but also press for an amendment or interpretation of tho Covenant which should deny to the Council any jurisdiction whatsoever in the case of a dispute whioh has been held by the permanent Court to arise out of a matter which by international law is sololy within the jurisdiction of one party to the dispute.I cannot but regard the attitude of the Dominions in this connection as supremely serious, and I would urge that no steps be taken in this country to sign the document until or unless it is known that, all the Dominions have agreed to sign.     The unity of the British Bnpiro should be brought out in the effective instrument, ai it is in the annex to the Covenant, the Dominions being namod subjaeently to the British Empire-.It may further be advisable that the British Empire should not sign or ratify until Japan has done so.   personally, I doubt whether thero are strorg reasons or even any reasons for Japan considering it -to her military advantage to accept the protocol, especially if the Covenant is regarded as already containing the point mentioned above which Japan contended for at Geneva, namely, that the Council is not barred by any decision of the permanent Court on questions of domestic
domestic jurisdiction from taking action under Article 11 of the Covenant; this Article indicates no special action end is very general in its terms.The importance to this country of knowing that Japan, tho power next in Naval strength to the U.S.A. and the British Empiro has accepted the protocol need not he laboured,,So far I have stressed my argument on the doubtful if not hostile attitude of the Tjominions and the need to be sure that Japan is a signatory of the protocol I pass now to the effect of the protocol on the attitude of the UoSoA. towards the league of Nations0   It is a matter of common knowledge that tho TJoSoAc is extremely sensitive on tho subject of matters coming, as it contends, solely within its domestic juris diction, e0g. the admission of immigrants and the Monroe doctrine.It has held aloof from the league mainly on the ground that it could net submit such questions to outside jurisdiction.    If it has done so on tho Covenant as interpreted by the Commission of Jurists, how will it regard the new development under the Japanese amendment?Further, I cannot but think that from the point of view of an American citizen the arrogation by the Council -of ? r\ght to declare that the UoS* . is an aggressor in the circumstances mentioned in Article 16 of the protocol will be regarded as an additional argument against joining the league.I am sure that the L\S*A. will not sign the protocol itself for two or three decades at least, for the reasons given by Mr. Hughes in his letter of the,, 1st March 1925, which I attach (Appendix I).Should Japan remain a member of the league butnot
- 5 -482not acoopt the protocol, and if tho Uo3,A. continueto remain outside the league, then the advantages ofthe protocol to the other great Naval Power, namely,the British Empire, will, I feel, ho outweighedimmeasurably hy the disadvantages.     These twooountries seem to me so situated, so strong, and incertain circumstances possibly so stubborn in theirassertion of their rights that they would, and could,disregard the sanctions of the protocols     I dread theincreasod occasions being provided hy the protocolfor should I say by their re-discovery within the ambitof the Covenant) for the Council to bring into operationtho sanctions mentioned in Article 16 of the Covenant,,The ooonomic and financial sanctions are a tremendousweapon, but have we considered the effect of their application to the TJ0S.Ao, far instance, on the positionof London as the financial centre of the world?     Iappend a copy of the correspondence which took placobetween Lord Curzon and lord r0 Cecil on the occasion ofthe dispute between Greece and Italy,(Appendix II).   Noether eountrr in the League woul&apos;. sacrifice so much as great Britain in applying the financial sanctions..Again, the General Report^ page 12, in stating(under Article 10 of che protocol) -&quot;that it was in accordance with tho spirit of &quot;tho protocol that acts of violence and force &quot;which possibly may not constitute sn actual state &quot;of war should&apos;nevertheless be taken into &quot;consideration by the Council,&quot;seems to me to increase indefinitely the number of occasions on which the UoS^A. may come into conflict with the League, and on which economic and financialintercourse may be completely interruptedc.        ..Vi -League of Nations document A.135. 1924, dated 1st October 1924.
A Q o5 32.    I turn now to my second head -. .gone of theambiguities in the.Protocol.    It is in itself anintricate and difficult document and the difficulties are not made less by the interpretation and views expressed by the Rapporteurs.    I should like to besure that the Protocol speaks for itself and that thereports of the Rapporteurs will not subsequently bebrought up as an authoritative commentary on its text.Bat in this connection we cannot ignore the Continentalpractice.    In the General Report to tie london conference 1909 we find this paragraph;-&quot;We now reach the explanation of the &quot;Declaration itself, on ttnich we shall try, by &quot;summarising the Reports already approved by the &quot;Conference, to give an exact and uncontroversial &quot;commentary ;   this, when it has became an official commentary by receiving the approval of the &quot;Conference, may serve as a guide to the different &quot;authorities - administrative, military and &quot;judicial - who may be called on to apply it&quot;.(a)   As regards the obligations of tho Protocolthough the &quot;sanctions&quot; (Article 11) were discussed at length at Geneva, the position is by no means clear.Lord Parmoor in his letter to the &quot;Times&quot; of October 15thha. stated, &quot;The sanctioned; on Article of the protocol does&quot;not purport to create, and does not create any new&quot;sanctions.    It makes operative, under the conditions&quot;specif let&apos;, the sanctions mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2&quot;of Article 16. of the Covenant.    I do not think that the&quot;paragraph of this Article which interprets  he&quot;obligations undertaken by each of the signatory States,&quot;goefl beyond the provisions in the Covenant, but quite&quot;certainly it does not in any way interfere with the&quot;sovereignty of a nation as regards the use of its &apos;&quot;military, naval, or air forces&quot;.   sMr,Henderson, in his speech on the Protocolat Burnley on the 12th October, is reported to&apos;have saidsignatory.....
signatory States were &quot;solemnly pledged that their &quot;forces should be used to make the decisions effective &quot;if sanity, reason, right and justice fail, and these &quot;sanctions had to be employed&quot;.The difference in interpretation seems considerable. I therefore think it advisable to recapitulate past views, and to add a few remarks.The Foreign Office opinion as given in CM.TL416B was, that &quot;Article 16 is primarily concerned with&quot;economic and financial measures, but paragraph 2 &quot;also contemplates the use of armed forces to be &quot;contributed by members in accordance with a &quot;recommendation from the Council.   In this case also &quot;our own consent to the recommendation will he &quot;required before it is made.   Paragraph 3 contains &quot; an  agreement to support other members of the &quot;League&quot;in resisting any special measures aimed &quot;at one of their number by the Covenant-breaking &quot;State.   No authoritative interpretation cf this &quot;provision has been issued by the league, hut it may &quot;doubtle&amp;s he assumed that any military or other &quot;measures, to be t...ken in accordance with it will be :,taken as the result of a recommendation from the &quot;Council, and therefore subject to our concurrence. &quot;In view of Article 17 of the Covenant, the area within &quot;which action may have to he taken under Article 16 &quot;must he regarded ss co-extensive with the world. &quot;Generally speaking, it may be said that unless &quot;Article 10 is given a peremptory interpretation, which &quot;seems unlikely, rather than otherwise, the Covenant &quot;of the League&apos;of Nat ions imposes no obligation&quot; on &quot;H.M. Government to take military action in any event &quot;excep&quot;, with the concurrence of their representative &quot;on the Council&quot;.It is understood that in the third paragraphof Article 11 cf the Protocol the words at thecommencement, mamely (&quot;in accordance with paragraph 3&quot;of Article 16 of the Covenant&quot;) have to be emphasised as showing clearly that this paragraph, refersonly to economic and financial sanctions, but itwould, be well to note the words at the end - &quot;take all measures/
&quot;measures in their power to preserve the &quot;safety of communications by land and by sea nof the attacked or threatened state&quot; - which clearly point to Naval measures.In any case, as I have stated in the Cabinet Paper (CP.456/24), it is only by Naval measures that the safety of sea communications of a \.threatened State can be safe &quot;guarded, i.e., while paragraph 3 of Article 11 was probably intended &quot;merely to protect the victim of aggression and &quot;could not go beyond it&quot; the Naval Forces to be effective must operate within reach of the Naval Forces of the aggressor State,I doubt whether the Dominions, especially Canada, whose attitude is well known in connection with the proposed revision of Article 10 of the Covenant, will be able to accept Article 11 of the Pro toe61;A porw&amp;al of the remarks   in the General Report under Article 11 (see page 17) shows in my opinion that States have &quot;the obligation to anply the necessary &apos;&apos;SM2&apos; iens of every kind &quot;s a direct result of the &quot;decisions of the Counciln, and this is described as a &apos;&apos;new element&quot;, whereas under the Covenant Military sanctions kid to be recommended by a unanimous decision, which recommendation might not be followed.   It seems to me to be begging the question to say that no burdenhas/
lias been imposed on States beyond the sanctions al-re&amp;dy provided for in the Covenant.   The point surely is that more occasions have been created for the application of sanctions, and that a State like Great Britain is now being pledged to intervene with armed forces.   The new scheme is applicable to acts of aggression which do not under the Covenant involve obligations or which cannot, speaking generally, be regarded as prohibited under the Covenant - see Action with reference to a demilitarised sone, an armistice, etc., Article 10 of the Protocol.   &quot;;ven the provisions of Article 7 of the Protocol, as the general reports says, page 15, are not unaccompanied by sanctions, and the Council can surely only take such &quot;measures as may be &quot;appropriate in each concrete case&quot; with the help of the pledged forces of Signatory States.I do not think I need apologise for   the length at which I have dealt with this cuestion of &quot;sanctions&quot;. It is a vital question and needs the greatest precision in its presentation.(b)   Again, there is a. certain want of clarity about relations between Signatories to the Protocol and others. This can be perhaps most easily demonstrated by writing paragraph 2 of Article 1 in the following form:-&quot;The Signatory States agree -(1) That, as between themselves, these provisions shall be binding from the coming into force of the present Protocol and(2) That so far as they are concerned the Assembly and the Council of the League shall thenceforth have power to exercise all the rights,etc. as conferred by the Protocol&quot;.It
It should have been definitely stated whether the injunctions referred to in Article 7 are applied to a signatory who is a party to a dispute with a State, Member of the League, which is a Non-Signatory, or with a Non4iem.be r of the League.The first paragraph of Article 7 deals with a dispute between Signatory States, but the second paragraph embodies Article 11 of the Covenant whose opening words are &quot;any war cr threat of war whether &quot;immediately affecting any of the Members of the &quot;League or not&quot;.More emphasis should, I think, have been placed to the possibility if not probability that a number of Members of the League may not sign the Protocol, and on the fact that there are important nations still outside the League.The General Eeport in remarking on Article 16 does, however, state -&quot;In possible conflicts with a Statenon-signatory
&quot;non-signatory and non-member of the League, &quot;Signatory States are entirely free to take &quot;such action as they chooserTho British Empire being world-wide has to consider     /especially the States non-signatory of the Protocol.(c) It is remarkable that in such an important Article as Article 7 of the Protocol there is no olsar definition of &quot;Dispute&quot;o     Historically there have been many disputes which for a time created a certain amount of friction between this country and say, the United States of America, but ultimately were amicably or easily settled, and meanwhile increase of armaments or effectives, 6*g5 warship construction and enlist-ment, proceeded normallycAs examples one may quote the friction caused by the British exercise of belligerent maritime rights at the commencement of the Greater, our disputes with America over the executive action taken to enforce the Alcoholic Liquor Prohibition Law or over the proposed exemption of all American vessels from Panama Canal 1&apos;nicholls, Alaska Boundary disputes in 1903, Venezuelan Incidents in 1895 and 1902 etc. 5ven differences of opinion of a character analogous to that shown in the correspondence we had with Prance over the evacuation of the Ruhr might apparently fall within the category of &amp; dispute under Article 7 of the Protocol,(d) It is to be noted that on page 14 of the General Report dealing with Article 0 of the Protocol it is stated that the force employed by a State must be proportionate to the object in view, and must be exercised within the limits and under the conditions recommended by the Council.     this proposition as regards Naval Activities needs further exposition,The &quot;sea is all one&quot;, and it is a false idea to envisage tho functions of warships aa limited to a particular theatre of operations and to contemplate some ships of the Navy
as aotively engaged on one ocean in helping a threatened State or coercing an aggressor whilst ships in other ooeans remain absolutely passive;   the oontrol of an enemy1s commerce is normally exercised in every sea.Though it is believed that the aim of the delegated at Geneva was that the reoaloitrant power should not he orushingly overwhelmed by the forces brought against it, yet the proposition in the General Report that the foroe employed by a State must be proportionate to the object in view might mean that a large foroe may he required on occasions;   under Article 11 of tho Protoool, however, It is recognised that a Signatory State is obliged to co-operate loyally and effectively in the degree whioh Its geographical position and particular situation as regards armaments allow,     Ihis is a reasonable proviso in many ways hut it will afford an opportunity to many States, e.g. Scandinavian Nations (who have been desoribed as &quot;professional neutrals&quot;) praotioally to contract out of the obligations of the protocol and a larger burden may morally rest on Sreat Britain.     In any case the situation envisaged serves to demonstrate the ambiguous nature of our obligations,(e)   Article 19 is peculiarly ambiguous, It is bb follows&quot;Exoept as expressly provided by its terms, the &quot;present Protoool shall not affeot in any way the &quot;rights and obligations of Members of the League &quot;as determined by the Covenant&quot;,A very normal (and Indeed the most obvious) interpretation of this Artiole would be to the effect that the rightB and obligations of the Members of the League as determined by the Covenant are not affected by the Protocol exoept where the Protocol contains provisions which affeot those rights and obligations&quot; and the ordinary deader would endeavour to find in the Protocol the clauses that modify the rights and obligations of Members of the league whether Signatory of the Protocol or not.The General Report on page 20 states
&quot;The present Protocol emphasises and defines certain &quot;obligations arising out of the Covenant.    Those of &quot;which tho present Protooel makes up mention are&apos; &quot;not affected in any manner.    They still ejdst&quot;.This commentary would bear out the above interpretation ae itseems to imply that the obligations of the Covenant havo boonaffected.   The clue to the meaning can be found in the last paragraph on page 14 of the General Report, from which itappears that Article 19 is to be read in the following sense,namely:-&quot;Except as expressly provided by its terms the present &quot;Protocol, shall not affect in any way the rights and &quot;obligations of States signatory of the Protbool qua &quot;their rights and obligations as Members of the League&quot;,3,    One last word,   Many of our difficulties in connectionwith the ProtoojL have, I think,: arisen through, insufficientconsultation with expert advisers,   As to this I have nopersonal knowledge, but the following paragraph which I quotefrom a Memorandum of the Chiefs of Staff prepared- for theCommittee of Imperial.Defence seems to Indicate this,&quot;Considerable apprehension has been caused by the &quot;methods of procedure pursued at Geneva,   Pop instance &quot;the Protocol for Pacific Settlement of International &quot;Disputes was prepared without the Naval, Military and &quot;Air experts being consulted and they had in oonsequenoe &quot;no opportunity of obtaining the opinion of th&amp;ir &quot;Departments in London,   This resulted In various &quot;articles being included in the Protocol to which the &quot;three Chiefs of Staff take great exception and which are &quot;considered to jeopardise the safety of the Empire.   No &quot;amendments or reservations to the Protocol seem to have &quot;been contemplated and, therefore, should It be decided &quot;to reject it a certain amount of odium would be attached &quot;to the British government as being one of the joint &quot;authors of- the documents   This unenviable situation &quot;would have been avoided had.the protocol been prepared &quot;without hurry and if the opinions of the various &quot;departments had been obtained0-&quot;The practice of presenting to the Council documents &quot;which have&apos;not previously been studied by the members is&quot; &quot;also open to objection.   League document C ,567(1) M0193S1Q24 &quot;IX,, o&amp;ntaining proposals for the procedure leading up to &quot;the Disarmament Conferonoe was put before the -Council on &quot;3rd October, and forthwith adopted although the technical &quot;experts had had no opportunity of expressing their opinions &quot;or consulting the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministrya &quot;The Naval and Military experts recommended an adjournment &apos; &quot;until these opinions had been obtained, but without avail&quot;,-ADMIRALTY, S.W.I.27th October, 1924.,(Intd.)      C,
By dear Mr.President,I have recel&amp;ed your letter of February 28, enclosing a request handed to you by Senator lodge, ohairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, for oertain information desired by the oommittGe in order to reach a deoisien relative to advising and consenting to our adhesion to the protocol establishing the permanent court of international justice.       I beg leave to submit the following statement upon the points raised;First, the inquiry is this:That the President be requested to advise &quot;the Committee whether he favours an agreement obligating all Powers or governments who are signers of the protocol oreating the Court to submit all questions about which there is a dispute, and whioh cannot be settled by diplomatic efforts, relative to;  (a) The interpretation of treaties; (b) any question of international law; (o) the existence of any faot which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation; (d) the nature or extent of reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation; (e) the interpretation of a sentence passed by the court.I understand that the question is not intendedto elicit your purely personal opinion, or whether you would look with an approving eye upon an agreement of this sortmade effeotive by the aotion of all Powers, but whether you,as President, in the exercise of your constitutionalauthority to negotiate treaties, favour the undertaking tonegotiate a treaty on the part of the United States withother Powers creating suoh an obligatory jurisdiction.So understood,, I think that the question mustbe answered in the negative. This is for the reason that the senate has so clearly defined its attitude in opposition tosuch an agreement that until there is ground for believing that..........Washington. - &apos;J &quot;     Mar oh 1st 19 23.
Moored International Law Ligest, VolcYII.pp.76-76that this attitude has been changed it wuld be-entirely futile for the Executive to negotiate any treaty of the sort described.I may briefly&apos;refer to earlier efforts In this direction.In the latter part of the Cleveland administration a very strong publio soatiment was expressed in favour of a general arbitration treaty he Ween the United States and Great Britain, this being regarded as a step toward a plan for all oivilised nations * In January 1897,. the Olney-Pauncefote treaty was signed, with provisions for compulsory arbitration having a wide 80ope* This treaty was supported not only by the Cleveland administration but President McKinley endorsed it in the strongest terms in his annual message, of December 6, 1397, urging &quot;the early action of the Senate thereon not merely as a matter of policy but as a duty to mankind&quot;. But despite the safeguards established by the treaty the provisions for compulsory arbitration net with disfavour in the Senate, and the treatyofaile do&quot;A series of arbitration treaties was concluded in 1.904 by Secretary Hay with about twelve&apos; states. Warned by the fate of the Olney-Pauncefote treaty:, Secretary Hay limited the provision for obligatory arbitration in those treaties to &quot;differences whioh may arise of a legal nature or relating to the interpretation of treaties existing between the two contracting parties, and which it may not have been possible to settle by diplomacy&apos;1. Even with this limitation there was added the further proviso: -&quot;Provided, v .( nevertheless, that they (the differences) do not affect the vital interests, the independence, or the honour of the two
- 16 -contracting States, and do nob concern the interestsof third parties&quot;iIt was also provided that the parties shouldoonolude a &quot;special agreement&quot; in each individual case,&quot;defining clearly the matter in dispute, the soope of thepowers of the arbitrators, and the periods to be fixed forthe formation of the arbitral tribunal and the severalstages of the procedure&quot;aNotwithstanding the limited scope of these treatiesfor oompilsory- arbitration, the Senate amended them by substituting the phrase &quot;special treaty&quot; for &quot;speoialagreement&quot;, so that in every individual case of arbitrationa special treaty would have to be made with the3and consent of the Senate^ In-view of this ohange, Secretary Hay announced that the President weald not submit the amendment to the other government SoIt should alse;&quot;be observed that the Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907, to whioh the United States is a party, relating to the general arbitration of certain classes of international differences, do not make reo-ourso to the tribunal compulsory^In 1903 a series, of arbitration treaties was negotiated by the United States* The provisions of these treaties were limited to &quot;differences which may axist of a legal nature or relating to the interpretation of treaties existing between the two contracting parties and which it may not have been possible to settle by diplomacy1&apos;, with the proviso &quot;that they do not affect the -vital interests, the independence, or the honour of the two contracting states, and do not concern the interests of third parties&quot;t Secretary Soot also provided, taking aooount of the failure.PP,102-103*
of the Hay treaties, that &quot;in each individual, ease&quot; &quot;he contracting parties before appealing to the arbitral tribunal should conclude a &quot;i;jeoial agreement&quot; defining the matter in dispute, the scope and powers of the arbitrator, and so forth, and it was further explicitly stipulated in these treaties that such &quot;special agreement&quot; on the part of the United States should be made by the Presidenfby and with theadvioe and consent of the Senate&quot;. These treaties, with these limiting provisions, made in deference to; the opinion of the Senate as to the permissible soope of such agreements, reoeived the Senate&apos;s approval6In 1911 the Taft administration submitted to the Senat general arbitration conventions with Great Britain and with France which were of broad scope. There were numerous otjj eat ions on the part of the Senate. There was a provision in Article 3 that, in case of a controversy as to whether a particular difference was justifiable, the issue should be settled by a proposed joint high commission. Objeotion was made that such an arrangement was an unconstitutional delegation of power, and the provision was struck out by the Senate, Again the Senate conditioned its approval on numerous other reservations, withholding from the operation of the treaty any question &quot;vhich affects the admission of aliens into the United States, or the admission of aliens fco the educational institutions of the several States, or the territorial integrity of the Several States or of the United States, or oonoernlng the question of the alleged indebtedness or moneyed obligation of any State of the United States, or any question which depends upon or involves the maintenance&apos; of the traditional attitude of the United States ooncerning American questions, oommonly described as the Monroe Doctrine or other purely governmentalpolioy.......
policy :.In the emended 10m the treatise were not aceeatable to the aduixiititrstion end renain mrratifiea.In the li/jht of this record it vovld seem to be entirely clear that until the Senate changes its attitude it would be a waste of effort for the&apos;president to attempt to negotiate treaties with the other powers providing for an obligatory jurisdiction of the scope stated in the coKimittee!s first inquiry quoted above.If the Senate, or even the Committee on. Foreign Relations, would indicate that a different point of view is now entertained, you might properly consider the advisability of negotiating such agreements.I am, my dear Mr.President, Faithfully yours,Charles E.Hughes.
The Marquess Ourzon of Kedleston to Consul, Geneva.Foreign Office, (Ko.48). September 5, 192S, 6 P.M.FOLLOWING for Lord Robert Cecil;-&quot;In view of possibility of league action having to be taken against Italy, the various departments concerned have bo en warned to study article 16 and measures that would be entailed by its strict application.    Other Departments have not, so far, expressed their views, but Treasury are seriously perturbed at the consequences of a literal application of the&quot; article.&quot;Following are their views, which are sent you for your general guidance should the matter take serious shape.   But you naturally would not, in any case, commit His Majesty&apos;s Government to any course of action without first consulting us fully&quot;Following from Treasury:-&quot; !To give effect to the undertaking contained in the first paragraph of article 16 of the covenant, it would&apos;be necessary to impose forthwith control of all foreign correspondence, all foreign credit operations, including remittances abroad, and of the whole of impori; and export trade of the kingdom, in short, to re-establish the follow.ing war-time departments with full war-time powers:-&quot; &apos;Postal and cable censorship&quot; &quot;Foreign Trade axil Blockade Departments  and the&quot; &quot;Trading with the enemy Department of the Treasury.&quot; &apos; It would have to be made a legal offence to correspond (directly or indirectly) with any person resident in the offending State, to enter (directly or indirectly) into any commercial or financial contrac- with or for the benefit of such a person, to complete any suet transaction already entered into, to remit money to any such nerson, to accept, pay, or discount any bill drawn by or held for such a person etc.    No bank, accepting house, stockbroker or trader, could accept any order or instruction or buy or sell any goods to any resident abroad, unless satisfied that there was no direct or indirect benefit to a person resident in the offending State-    This would involve the imposition of the war-time system of declarations before.any business could be entertained. a No banker could open any foreign credit, or allow any drawing against a confirmed foreign credit, or remit money abroad with-out a declaration;   no person could export or import goods with out an undertaking that the origin or destination of the goods was not the offending State.    The result would be a complete stoppage of all foreign business and all imports and exports until such time as declarations could be obtained.&quot; Unless
w &apos;Unless every State, in particular the United States of America, joined in these measures  they would be completely ineffective.    There would be nothing to prevent a member of the offending State obtaining goods or credits through his friends or setting up an address in a State not participating in the measures to be taken under the article, and until his detection, drawing money or obtaining goods from this country.    The detection of agents or bogus firms is a difficult and protracted business.    A whole department was during the war engaged for years in compiling a black list.&quot; &apos;UBless tne machinery adopted in all countries was equally effectivet the. country where the prohibition Was respected would simply lose business to the country where it could safely be ignored.&quot; &apos;Without war-time machinery including censorship high-class bankers and trading houses will lose business to less scrupulous competitors, and no such machinery will work unless generally and willingly accepted.    We do not believe banking or trading community will accept bureaucratic control and dislocation of trade, unless essential to prosecuting a war in which national feelings are intensely&quot;aroused1 &quot;.
