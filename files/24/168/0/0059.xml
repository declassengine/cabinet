[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. JPrinted for .the Cabinet.     September 1924.SEOBJST.CP. 457(24).The Situation in Bengal.I circulate lor the information of my colleagues the following telegraphic correspondence with the Viceroy in continuation of CP, 452(24),29th September 1924. OLIVIER.Telegram from Secretary .of State to Viceroy, dated 22nd September 1924. 2.6.96.   Private and personal.Cabinet this morning considered Bengal correspondence ending with your private and personal telegram oi .21st September, We noted point to which you call attention as to enlargement.of scope of special statute if phraseology you propose is adopted, but it appeared to us that this enlargement is aggravated by adoption of form you propose, that is to say, making provisions of clause .12 applicable to all offences in the schedule.We considered that the Schedule should be amended by omitting the whole of clause 1, which relates to offences which are either covered by Indian Arms Act or are not specially germane to present emergency. We do not object to provisions of first part of Ordinance, clauses I to 11, being made applicable to Schedule as so amended, but-we consider that application of powers contemplated under clause 12 should be limited as suggested in my telegram of 17th September. &apos;We therefore do not object to sub-clause (6) of clause 2 of Schedule in this connection, but assuming that legislation by reference to Penal Code is deemed by you necessary we do object to inclusion in sub-clause (a) of sections 124 (a), 153 (a), 385, 38&apos;tf, 387, 392, 394, 454, 455, 458, 459, 460, and it appears to us necessary that care should be taken that the-application of the special powers under section 12 should be strictly limited to offences of the character described in my telegram of the 17th September.We are ready to give powers to enable you to meet the situation created by the assassination and physical revolutionary movement, but we must urge upon you the necessity of making it quite clear that you are not asking for and are not using exceptional powers ,to deal with political movements, however troublesome. We must also urge upon you the further necessity of devising without delay some political policy which will save India from the political movement drifting into the revolutionary movement. We press this upon the Indian Government as being as urgent in its own way as repressive measures against crime, and wish to have advice on this matter. The Cabinet feel very keenly that repression should be preceded or accompanied by clear declarations and acts such as approaches to Indians commanding-support of majority in Councils to co-operate in Central Provinces and Bengal in forming Governments.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 23rd September 1924. 2705.   Private and personal.1. Last sentence of my telegram of 22nd was partly suggested by what 1 gathered from Lytton&apos;s and your private letters as to contributory causes of recent rejection of Ministers&apos; vote. Central Provinces situation doubtless less promising but might there be chance of Moonje reconsidering acceptance of office ?2. I wonder whether you have considered possible good public effect of sympathetic representation on your part to Gandhi against risk of fatal strain on his health ?Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 2Qth September 1924.Private and personal. Please refer to para. 3 of your private and personal telegram dated 22nd September, No. 2696, and your private and personal telegram dated 23rd September, No. 2705. The consideration of any general, political or constitutional changes must obviously await examination of the Report of the Committee of Enquiry.   I appreciate the anxiety of His Majesty&apos;? Government to arrive at a remedy
for the political difficulties in the two Provinces referred to. I have definite views as to the course we should follow in Bengal and the Central Provinces, which I am explaining in this telegram. Meanwhile, please remember that, even if a remedy, can be obtained, it is unlikely to have an effect direct or indirect on the revolutionaries. The latter are really irreconcilables. They were willing to further some of the aims of Das&apos;s party in Bengal, because that party was prepared to give them monetary assistance. Bengal Swarajists, on their part, were willing to risk the employment of the dangerous assistance of the Bengal revolutionary party, because they saw it as a ready form of pressure and intimidation to obtain political domination, but it must not necessarily be inferred that the revolutionaries agree with the ultimate aim of the Das party. The objects at which they aim, and the means by which they would attain them, are different. There is a mutual dependence and an unholy alliance because each party hopes to obtain from the other something of use to gain its individual goal whicb it could not easily otherwise secure.2. I have discussed situation in the Central Provinces with Sly. Position is better, and there is a steady but slow change in feeling. People are becoming conscious that progressive programme in nation-building departments has been checked by Swarajist action. Nevertheless, Sly has satisfied me that dissolution of the Legislative Councils at present would be productive of no useful result. As regards your suggestion about Moonje, he has made it clear that Moonje&apos;s party would not permit him to accept office as Minister.3. The only wise course is for the Governor of the Central Provinces to continue to carry on careful administration of transferred subjects under emergency powers until budget season. Legislature wall onlv be called to discuss budget. By budget session, understanding as regards position will be more widespread. By then there will be some surplus, and it will be possible to frame an attractive budget with progressive development in nation-building departments. Definite offer will then be made to Legislature of opportunity to carry this programme by agency of Ministers, according to the intention of the constitution. It will be made clear that if offer is rejected alternative is re-transfer and execution of programme by reserved agency. I am convinced that this is the only course to follow. Sly agrees with me. You will understand that this notion is based upon present conditions and subject to decisions resulting from the report of the Reforms Enquiry Committee.4. The same course generally would be adopted in Bengal. There may be modi-fications in the Bengal case. The next session of the Bengal Council cannot be deferred until the budget season because, as you are aware, Council must shortly he summoned to consider special legislation to deal with revolutionary crime. Also Swarajist element in Bengal Council is not so completely predominant as in the Central Provinces. These facts may offer opportunities for a speedier solution, but we cannot count on it.
