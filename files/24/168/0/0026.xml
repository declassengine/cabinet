A Departmental Committee was at work in 1913 and 1914, considering how the Bchemes of the Report could be put into effect, but it had not finished its labours when war broke out and any idea of legislation was inevitably deferred.   I have reviewed the present position and have consulted with a &quot;&quot;selection of the most important academic authorities.   There is a strong desire for reform in many quarters, but there is also a general feeling that some of the findings of the Haldane Commission require reconsideration in view of the long period that has elapsed. I therefore wish for the approval of the Cabinet to the appointment of a Departmental Committee, in order to lay down the basis upon whioh a Statutory Commission could act.   I should propose that the Reference should be as follows&quot;To oonsider the final Report of the Royal Commission on University Education in London dated the 27th March, 1913, and, having regard to present circumstances and after consultation with the persons and bodies concerned, to indicate what are the principal changes now most needed in the existing constitution of the University of London and on what basis a Statutory Commission should be set up to.... \&apos; I1.\j i
8      ic^sSffo^c&apos; &quot;. frame new Statutes for the University.&quot;.I hare reason to suppose that if suoh a Departmental! Committee were appointed, Lord Ernie, who is very unbiassed and who has had experience of analogous problems on the Oxfordl and Cambridge Commission, might be prepared to aot as Chairman^   I should like to be able to appoint it at onoe so that it might be possible for it to oommenoe its sittings immediately after the holidays.&apos;C,T.&apos;30th July, 1924.
