Copy No. 3*9&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;t&quot;&quot;*&quot; iPOOR LaW REFORM. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEAITH.It will be within the recollection of the Cabinet that early in the Session on the occasion of the Poplar Debate pledges were given by the Government to introduce some measure of Poor Law Reform, and that In the hope of securing a general measure of agreement the other political parties were Invited to participate In a Conference at which, it waa suggested, the main principles on which the proposed reform should be based might be discussed.    Unfortunately this attempt has proved abortive, and It accordingly devolves   uPon t^ie Government to produce Its own scheme without assistance from either of the other parties.My Department have devoted much time and thought to the consideration of this question, but we are unable to make further progress without some directions from the Cabinet as to the lines upon whioh we should proceed.      Briefly, the question Is whether we should aim at (1) a general reorganisation of the whole system of public assistance, or (2) a reform of the Poor Law throughout England and Wales, or (3) a reform of London Poor Law, or (4) a general reform of London Government on the lines suggested by the London Labour Members in a statement which they recently forwarded to the ^ime Minister.My own view is that the proposed legislation should dealwith the reform of the Poor Law throughout England and Wales.So far as I can judge from the declarations made by leaders of theother parties, a Bill with this object should receive a generalmeasure of support and it would clearly be In strict accordancewith the pledges given on behalf of the Government,I attach to this Memorandum a Paper drawn up in my Depart-ment dealing In more detail with the points at issue, and I suggest
that this Paper should be referred to a   Committee of the Cabinet which should report before the Recess so that my Department may proceed with the preparation of whatever scheme may be decided upon during the Autumn.(Intd.) J.W.Ministry of Health,1st August, 1924.
POOR   LAW   REFORM., public Assistance.    Multiplicity of existing services and authorities.1.    Local Government, as we know It to-day, is based in the main on three sets of enactments, (1) the Poor Law Acts, (2) the Public Health Act; 1875, and amending Acts, and (3) the Local Government Acts of 1888 and 1894.    VJhile it would no doubt be incorrect to say that these three codes have been built up without any regard to the need for coordinating their effects, it is nevertheless broadly true that no real attempt has been made to fit them into one common systems    But this is not all,     Since 1888, there has been a great awakening of the social conscience and a corresponding expansion of   -measures and machinery designed to ameliorate the con-dition of the people.   Unfortunately the programme of social reform has been carried out on no concerted plan. On the other hand it has been characterised by a common feature, whioh, however, has only added to the confusion and overlapping, namely, a-determination to entrust no new functions to the Poor Law Authorities end to place the new services in other hands.2.    Superimposed on this congeries of Local Government systems and authorities we have had, since the National Insurance Act was passed in 1911, an entirely different pattern of social legislation which has little integral connection with the machinery of Local Govern-ment,3.    It is not surprising that the want of a common aim and a guiding principle in the social reform legislation of recent years has resulted in a state of confusion and overlapping which would have led to chaos
but for the genius of the British people in making appar-ently unworkable systems work in some way or another. That the system, or want of system, is expensive-and in-efficient can hadrly be denied, and it is a condition pre-cedent of all reform to reduce it to some semblance of order and uniformity.    At present, services are needlessly duplicated, control, both central and local, over expendi-ture and administration is   weakened, the economical use of existing facilities and rational organisation of new provision is prevented, and the ordinary citizen   finds it Impossible to realise either his responsibilities or his rights.4.     The diverse character and the wide range of needs eovered by the existing Public Assistance Services is thus described by the Betterton Committee&quot;Through them the community has undertaken (1) &quot;to provide, in the interests of general public health and &quot;welfare, free treatment and care for persons affected by &quot;certain forms of sickness and infirmity;   (2) to assist &quot;in the maintenance of the aged who are in needy circum-&quot;stances;   (3) to watch specially over the welfare of &quot;school children and of nursing mothers and their infants; &quot;(4) to assist by cash payments in meeting the risks of &quot;slckneBs and unemployment among the employed population; &quot;(5) to assist in the relief of distress due to unemployment &quot;by measures designed to encourage the initiation of works &quot;of public utility for the purpose of providing employment &quot;In times of severe Industrial depression;   (6 ) to compensate &quot;those who have suffered disablement and the bereaved &quot;dependents of those who have lost their lives through &quot;war service according to the measure of their loss;   and &quot;(7) to provide, through the Poor Law, for each and all of
-its members a last resort against the final extreme of &quot;wanti* * *&quot;The various services have for the most part been &quot;instituted at different times and have developed on a &quot;number of independent lines.     They have been designed to &quot; provide for special contingencies as the need or demand &quot;for them   beoame apparent, frequently by different methods &quot;and in different measure;   different principles have &quot;entered into the conception of services providing for &quot;closely related forms of need, and different forms of &quot;administrative machinery have been set up for services &quot;broadly similar in purpose.    Moreover, a new scheme of &quot;assistance for a particular form of need has normally &quot;been introduced with regard only to the special or &quot;technical requirements of persons affected by that need &quot;and even if, as is rarely the case, the new scheme is so &quot;widely applied as to meet completely&quot; the wants of all its &quot;individual beneficiaries, it ignores, and must ignore, &quot;oases which are outside its own prescribed limits.    The &quot;position is further complicated by the diverse forms and &quot;extent of the discretion possessed under statute by many &quot;of the local authorities to whom the administration of &quot;specialised forms of assistance has been entrusted.   In &quot;the legitimate exercise of this discretion assistance &quot;which may be granted freely in one area, jyay, in a &quot;neighbouring area, under a different Authority, be &quot;withheld or granted in different measure/1 Maclean CQmmittee,5c     With a view to the establishment of a more intelligible and economical system the Maclean Committee laid down certain broad lines of policy,,     The fundamental principle underlying the scheme cj*f reform proposed by that
9 9,4h) h! &apos;jiCommittee was the concentration, as far as possible, in one Local Authority for each area of responsibility for the administration Of all expenditure from public funds. As a first instalment of their policy they recommended the abolition of the Poor Law authorities and the merging of their functions in those of the County and Counts&apos; Borough Councils, and as the ultimate object to be aimed at they had in view such a reorganisation of local government as would render unnecessary any further multiplication of separate authorities and would facilitate the further unification of services.Special arguments for the abolition of the JPoor Law Authorities.6. In regard to the proposal to abolish the Poor Law Authorities attention may he called to certain aspects of the question which are of special importance from the standpoints both of health and of economy.7. The medical and other services provided under the Poor Law must always suffer from the great disadvantage that the administering authority has no duties or powers in respect of the prevention of disease or other disabilities. It is not only prejudicial to the individual, but uneconomical, to stand by and allow a disability to develop to the point at which destitution is produced, before remedial measures are applied.    The administration of medical and other services should he placed In charge of authorities whose responsibilities are comprehensive in their respective spheres, who are empowered, and under obligation, to direct their efforts alike to prevention and to treatment, and are able, therefore, to place in proper relation measures suitably adapted to fulfil either or both of these objects.8. It was pointed out by the Maclean Committee that this inherent defect in the Poor Law authority as such leads to very undesirable results.r*   4   *&quot;
9.      In the first place, authorities are needlessly multiplied, and the co-existence of Boards of Guardians with other local authorities causes &quot;the largest and moat &quot;intractable case of overlapping&quot; In the present system of local government.   &quot;We are here faced,&quot;   the Committee reported, &quot;by overlapping functions and areas, and by con-&quot;fllcting principles of administration.      &apos; The resulting &quot;confusion has been aggravated by the growing popular pre-&quot;judice against the Poor Law, a prejudice which does less &quot;than justice to the devoted work of the Guardians, and the &quot;continuous improvement in poor law administration, &quot;especially in respect of the children and the oick.    For &quot;the last decade Parliament has been unwilling to entrust &quot;the Boards of Guardians with new functions, and the pro-&quot;vislon for new services has had to be made by other local &quot;authorities - in some oases new local authorities - often &quot;to the increase of the confusion and overlapping.     Further, &quot;the classification by institutions and the specialised &quot;treatment of recipients of assistance almost necessarily &quot;involve an enlargement of existing areas of administration. &quot;The Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress, &quot;which sat for over three years and took a very large &quot;amount of evidence, attached great importance to those &quot;points;   and both the Majority and Minority Reports con-burred in recommending the abolition of Boards of Guardians &quot;and of the Poor Law Union,.&quot;10.     In the second place, there is a consequential multiplication of staffs.   On this point the Committee reported that &quot;it is plainly undesirable to perpetuate &quot;the existence, even under one Local Authority, of separate &quot;staffs, with duplicate institutions, rendering,   tinder &quot;different Acts of Parliament, what must be to a large
9 o p^extent., the-eame services, whether the persons benefited -&quot;the sick and infirm, the children-of school age or the &quot;lunatics and the mentally deficient - be destitute or &quot;non-destitute.   It is obviously more economical that the &quot;specialised provision to be made for all persons having &quot;similar need  should be carried out by a united staff, &quot;with its appropriate series of specialised institutions, &quot;in alliance with the appropriate voluntary agencies,, &quot;under the supervision of the appropriate committee of &quot;the Council,&quot;11, In the third place, it is obvious that the existence of the separate Poor Law authorities with their separate staffs must give rise to unnecessary expenditure. Out of the total of over 42^ millions spent on the Poor Law service in the year ending March,- 1922, expenditure on the remuneration of staff  (not including the cost of central adminis-tration) accounted for over 8 millions, including  .700,000 for salaries, &amp;c. of clerks to Boards of Guardians and other members of Guardians&apos; clerical staffs, and over 7^ millions for salaries, &amp;c. of medical officers, dispensers,, nurses, and other officers engaged exclusively in connection with the relief of persons in institutions or in their own homes.12. There thus appears to be an overwhelming case In favour of the abolition of the Boards of Guardians and the transfer of their functions to other authorities on the lines recommended by the Maclean Committee.    That Committee set out to reconcile, and largely succeeded in reconciling the divergent views ofthe Majority and Minority Reports of the Royal Commission, and the general principles of the Maclean Committee&apos;s Report have bee7!? accepted by previous Governments. The case for a general reorganisation of the public social services.13. There is however at the present tlma a
distinct movement in favour of a general reorganisation of the public social services, and objections are being raised by the supporters of this movement to any further &quot;piecemeal legislation&quot;*    It may be questioned, however, whether the reforms proposed by the advocates of this policy might not themselves be described as pieoemeal legislation.    So much depends upon the angle from which the problem is regarded.    For example, there is a school that wishes to &quot;envisage as an Integral whole the problem &quot;of Insurance against all the contingencies of industrial &quot;life&quot;, and to bring Into a Bingle scheme sickness, accident and unemployment Insurance, superannuation allowances, and pensions for widows^ and children.    While there is, no doubt^much to be said in favour of a scheme of this kind, it might quite legitimately be contended that such a scheme should be combined with, or at least should follow, instead of preceding, a scheme for establishing a definite relation between say, sickness insurance and the health services of the Local Authorities, or unemployment insurance and the Poor Law,14. While therefore the ideal policy might be to frame a large comprehensive scheme embracing all kinds of public assistance, it may be feared that the problem would be so unwieldy as to defy solution, or at the best inde-definitely postpone useful reform, and that before.any attempt could be made to frame practical proposals it would almost certainly be necessary to appoint another Royal Commission, the proceedings of which would have to await, or in some way be linked up with, the work of the present Royal Commission on Local Government and the
Royal Commission on National Health InsuranceReasons for commencing with Poor Law reform.16,    It may very well be that no reform of any branch of Publio Assistance should be undertaken without keeping in view tho comprehensive scheme into which every new or remodelled servioe should be capable of being ultimately moulded.   But, subject to this reservation,   there appear to be at least two practicable reasons for making a beginning with tho reform of the Poor Law;   firstly it Is by almost universal consent conceded that in any case the Poor Law must sooner or later bo drastically reformed, and secondly in the case of the Poor Law the ground has boon sufficiently covered already to obviate the need for furthor inquiry.General principles of Poor Law reform.16.    It will probably be oonoeded that some agreement the terms of reference to the Royal Commission on LocalGovernment are as follows:-&quot;To inquire as to the existing law and procedure relating to the extension of County Boroughs and the creation of new County Boroughs in England and Wales,   and the effect of such extensions or creations on the adminis-tration of the Counoils of Counties and on non-County Boroughs, Urban Districts, and Rural Districts;   to investigate the relations between these several local authorities;   and generally to make recommondations as to their constitution, areas, and functions.&quot;In the case of the Royal Commission on national health Insurance, the Commissioners are being asked to inquire into the scheme of National Health Insurance established by thoNational Health Insurance Acts,. 1911-22, and to report what,if any, alterations, extensions or developments should be madeIn regard to the scope of that sohomo and tho administrative,financial, and medical arrangements set up under it.
upon general prlnoiples whether on the lines laid dotm by the Maclean Committee or otherwise, is a necessary preliminary to any attempt to frame a measure of Poor Law Reform, even though, In view of the exigencies of Parliamentary time, it may be thought desirable, as a first step, to draw up a detailed scheme restricted to the reform of London Poor Law. The case for dealing first with Poor Law Reform in London.17.    The case for dealing with London alone in the first instance may be said to rest partly on the particular urgency of the London problem, and partly upon the particular clreurostanoes whioh differentiate the London Poor Law from other parts of the oountry,18.     It is interesting to note that In Part IX. paragraph 27, of the Majority Report of the Royal Commission the Commissioners stated &quot;The area to be included in the &quot;London district and the administrative maohinery to be &quot;established in that area require special attention. The case for the abolition of Boards of Guardians has &quot;been mo e conclusively demonstrated in London than In &quot;any other part of the Kingdom   .....   We found &quot;that there was an almost universal opinion .... &quot;that the px*esent system, basod on popular election in a &quot;multiplicity of separate districts, does not, under the &quot;conditions surrounding it, produce the right class of &quot;poor law administrator, cr secure generally economical &quot;and efficient administration&quot;.19.    The problem In London is further differentiated from the general problem in England &quot;and Wales by the existence of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund,   and particularly by the extension of that Fund by emergency legislation during the present period of unemployment to cover a substantial charge in respect of the cost of
the administration of-outdoor relief.   Another feature differentiating London administration from that in the provinces is the existence of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, which, though primarily a poor law body, is also the London authority for the provision of hospital aooommodation for smallpox and other infectious diseases.20.    It must, however, bo borne in mind that a limitation of the reform to the Metropolis leaves untouched the serious problem of the administration of areas contiguous to London.  For instance, West Ham and Edmonton aro   areas in which the burden of the relief of tho poor is very heavy, and falls almost entirely on the locality, though the inhabitants are largely employed In London, and the existence of the towns depends upon their neighbourhood to the Metropolis with whioh they are in essential unity.21.    It is conceivable therefore that a proposal to deal with London Poor Law alone may be met by a demand for a reform of London Government generally, including therein an extension of the present London area.   Should this be the case there would be a revival of the acutely controversial issues which wore examined, but not resolved, by the UllBwater Commi8eion.22.    It will be evident also that any scheme of Poor Law Reform for London must almost necessarily indicate the lines upon which reform throughout the country is contemplated, and it must accordingly be argued that, the interests oonoerned and the opposition to be anticipated being largely the same in either case, the balance of advantage would be in favour of a general Bill.   It may even be  suggested that the Parliamentary difficulties of securing a reform of the London Poor Law may be almost as serious as those of securing legislation covering thej &apos;
9Q1whole of England and Wales, and that the passing of a Bill affecting London alone will not make the passage of a subsequent Bill covering the whole country substantially more easy,tcatlon of the Maclean Committee&apos;s recommendations. (a) Modifications In detail necessary.23*   Whether the proposals for Poor Law reform are to extend to the whole country or to be restricted to London, the broad outlines of the plan suggested by the Maclean Committee for the transference of administrative powers from the Boards of Guardians to the County and County Borough Councils will probably be accepted, although some modifications in detail will be needed in view of change of circumstances or otherwise, and it will no doubt be found that the modifications required will be more extensive in the application of the scheme to London than in Its application to the provinces.24,   In the case of London the Maclean Committee recommended that the administration of Poor Law Institutions should be handed over to the London County Council and the administration of outdoor relief to the Metropolitan Borough Councils.     But the cost of administering out-door relief was to be defrayed to the extent of two-thirds by the County Council, provided that the County Council was satisfied,that the administration was conducted efficiently, economically, and on approved principles.    The County Council was also charged with the duty of laying down the policy and rules of local administration for the exercise of the Poor Law functions assigned to the Borough Councils, 25.   It ia obvious that a transfer of out-relief from the Boards of Guardians to the Metropolitan Borough Councils will do little towards solving the particular problem which
o n q(C- o* uhas brought this question again to the forefront.     In Poplar the Borough Council and the Board of Guardians are actuated by the same policy and are ^indeed largely identical In personnel, and It is not very likely that the Borough Council would prove itself more amenable to the control of the London County Council than the Guardians have been to the control of the Ministry of Health,26.   Accordingly the better plan might be to place the whole administration In the hands of the London County Council, out-relief, or Home Assistance as it Is called by the Maclean Oommittee, being entrusted to local committees of the County Council which, however, might be partly composed of representatives of the Borough Councils.27,   Should it be decided that the Bill to beintroduced should extend to the whole of England and Wales,the provision to be made would not be, in its main lines,substantially different from that required for the metropolis, though it would come In direct conflict witha larger number of interests and special circumstances.The scheme put forward by the Maclean Committee for county boroughs differs from that proposed for London only in sofar as It omits the establishment of local out-reliefauthorities within the area of the main authority - anomission which follows naturally from the smaller size and population of the oounty boroughs.   The scheme proposed for the provincial counties is substantially the same asthat proposed for London, if the modifications suggestedIn this memorandum are accepted for the London scheme.Principal difficulties as regards administrative machinery. -28.   Apart from the particular problem of London and the surrounding, area, the principal difficulties which
99 9iv cy cJwill probably arise in connection with the question of the administrative machinery Involved in the scheme of Poor Law Reform recommended by the Maclean Committee would seem to be (1) The position of the Minor local authorities in the scheme;   (2) the principle of co-option; (3) The allocation of the property and liabilities of the Guardians among the Councils concerned;   (4) The financial consequences of the transfer;   and (5) The allocation of transferred functions to specified oommittees.The Minor Local Authorities.29.   There have been few Bills in recent years conferring powers and dutiea on Local Government bodies in which controversy ha6 not arisen on the question of the position of the smaller local authorities, and it would have been surprising if similar differences of opinion had not emerged during the proceedings of the Committee,    The question is discussed in paragraphs 21-24 of the Report, and in three separate memoranda appended to the Report.30.   The way in which this question is dealt with in any legislation transferring the functions of Boards of Guardians to other Local Authorities must largely depend upon the position which these authorities occupy at the time when legislation takes place, and -what might be considered an ideal soheme will probably have to give place to an arrangement, though possibly of only a temporary character, which will take account of the powers and duties for the time being possessed by the existing Local Authorities, If, for instance, it be assumed that Poor Law Reform will precede any disturbance of the present functions of the minor urban and of the rural district councils, the medical services of those authorities cannot be left out of consideration in any scheme dealing with the transference
of the Poor medioal services.   On the whole it would seem that so long as the urban and rural district oouncils retain their present powers under the Public Health Acts, the precise arrangement to be made in each county area should be determined by a scheme prepared locally and confirmed by the Ministry of Health,, subject, however, to the proviso that so far as practicable ln-stitutlonal servicee should be concentrated in tho hands of the county authority,31.     It would also be advisable that all such schemes -should bo of a temporary and provisional nature, and subjoct to reconsideration and modification in the light of experience of their actual working or in conse-quenoo of subsequent legislation.Qo--.option.38.    The Maclean committee proposed proposed that any Committee through, whom any functions transferred to the Town or County Council from the Poor Law Authorities are to be administered shotild include mon and women and representa-tives or bodies (not being membera of tho Town or County Council) possessing experience of various kind3 in the work to be done, and   in the first instance persons who have been members of a Poor Law Authority.   They further pro-posed that tho Prevention of Unemployment Committee should include representatives of Employers&apos; Associations and of Organised Labour,53.    There is no doubt that the County and Municipal Councils would find it difficult adequately to discharge the additional functions proposed to be trans-ferred to -ahem without an enlargement of their committees; and it would be a real advantage to them to have the assistance of mon and women, who, though keenly interested
2n r*not possess the time or the inclination to devote them-selves to the general work of the Council and to face the ordeal of a County or Municipal election.   Moreover,provided that the power of the Council to reserve theright of giving a final decision on a subject of generalpolicy, and of the Finance Committee to control the ex-pendlture, Is duly safeguarded, it is difficult to seewhy these proposals should carry with them any diminution of popular control.34.   On the other hand it is well known that theLocal Authorities generally are opposed to the principle ofco-option, and it may be necessary to abandon this partof the scheme.Allocation of property and liabilities of Poor Law Authorities among the Councils concerned,35,   This will be a matter of considerable diff1-oulty, and it may be necessary to appoint Commissioners for the purpose,36.   In a large number of cases the present Union area does not coincide with or lie wholly within the area of any administrative county or borough;   institutions are frequently situated outside the area of the Union to which they belong;   in some Instances institutions are the joint property of a combination of Unions;   oertain Unions are well equipped with modern institutions, while others possess only an o id fashioned workhouse;   in some cases the Councils concerned will be in great need of additional institutions, in others they will already be in possession of as many institutions as they can economically administer. Similar questions will arise In regard to tho allocation of the existing staffs of the poor Law Authorities!    And the whole problem will be further complicated if the transference
should take place while the future policy of the country in regard to local government generally and health eer-vices In particular is still unsettled,Finance *37.   The financial consequences of their proposals were so lightly touched upon by the Maclean Committee that it may be said that thiB vital part of the problem still remains to be explored.    The financial adjustments between local authorities to whom property and liabilities of the Guardians are to be transferred, the financial relations in County areas between the County Council and the minor local authorities, the rates or funds out of which expendi-ture of various kinds under the new scheme is to be defrayed and consequential alterations in local taxation If the Poor Rate is abolished, the Exchequer Grants new and old, all these are questions of great complexity requiring the most careful examination before a Bill can be framed,Allocation of&quot;Functions to specified Committees.38,   In the separate Memorandum which he appended to the Report of the Maclean Committee Sir James Curtis saids-&quot;If County, Borough and other Councils are to be &quot;entrusted with further important functions, I consider &quot;these bodies should be allowed greater freedom than the &quot;recommendations permit of In allocating the now duties &quot;to committees,     A scheme appropriate to Manchester or &quot;Birmingham might be found Cumbersome and costly for &quot;Eastbourne.    Similarly a scheme suitable for a county &quot;mainly Industrial, such as Stafford, might be found &quot;unworkable In a Rural County such as Hereford,&quot;39,   Mr, Pritchard dealt with the same point In paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of his Memorandum..     He wrote;-&quot;The scheme relating to County Boroughs la in my &quot;opinion open,to the objection that it involves,unnecessary
997hi O  i&quot;interference with tho councils in regard to the manner &quot;in whioh, and particularly the committees through Tjhom &quot;the transferred functions are to be performed.&apos; In the &quot;past it was the practice of Parliament to confer and &quot;impose definite powers and duties upon Town Councils, &quot;and not to tell them how their functions ware to be &quot;performed or what committees they must appoint; the&quot;powers and duties being prescribed by Parliament^ the-&quot;responsibility for finding the best and most suitable &quot;method of carrying them out according to the local &quot;circumstances was left with the council in each case. &quot;A notable example of this policy Is the Public Health &quot;Act,1875, whereby most extensive powers are given to &quot;Urban and Rural Sanitary Authorities, but where Parlia-&quot;ment, wisely, in my judgment, refrained froin indicating &quot;what committee should -be appointed to assist in their &quot;performance.&quot;I am aware that more recently Parliament has in &quot;some cases interfered with the discretion of local &quot;authorities in theappointment of Committees, either by &quot;direct enactment or by requiring tha approval of schemes &quot;by a central department.&apos;  Personally, I think that this &quot;ia a mistake, and I trust that the praotice will not be &quot;extended.&quot;In   the present case if is, in my opinion, sufficient to transfer the funotions of the Poor law &quot;Authorities to the oouncils of County Boroughs, with &quot;such modifications and extensions as are desirable &quot;(the modifications consisting largely, I trust, of the &quot;removal of unnecessary central control) and to empower &quot;the councils in performing these functions to make use &quot;of their existing statutory committees (for example, the
&quot;asylums and education committees), and to appoint such,, &quot;other committees as they may think neoeuaary.&apos;    If &quot;thia course ;&apos;s not adopted, not only will unnecessary &quot;difficulties be placed in the way of councils in the &quot;performance of onerous duties, but there is the real &quot;fear that the netj statutory committees, and particularly &quot;the homo assistance committees, will be regarded as the &quot;old Poor Law&quot;Authority tinder a new name.&apos;&quot;40. Considerable weight must be attached to these reservations, and. it would be imprudent to provoke the opposition of the Local .%thorities by insisting that the schemes outlined in the Report should be translated intolegislation and imposed by statute upon the Oounty and Borough Councils.41.&apos; It might be desiarble for the Central Department to frame model sohemes and to require the Local Bodies to 3ubmit their schemes to the Central Department for oonfirma-tion, but even this limited amount of interference is open to some objection and it-is doubtful whether in the last resort the Central Department could legitimately refuse to confirm any scheme which purported to give effect to the general principles laid down by Parliament and did not merely perpetuate the old poor law authority under a new name.42. Xn any oase It may be assumed that a question of this kind could be better left to bo dealt with by regulations than settled by an Act of Parliament, and that if schemes are required to be framed and approved they should be subject to revision after a short experience of their working.(c) Abolition of the Poor Law, Implications and difficulties, and possible couraea of action.43,&apos; There would be a manifest saving of Parliamentary time, and the avoidance of muoh acute controversy, if the 3cheme of reform, whether for the whole country or for London
alone, could be limited to a mere transference of powers from the Boards cf Guardians to the County and County Borough Counsils^     But Poor Law Reform, as contemplated by the Mac-lean Committee and as generally understood at the present time, implies not only an alteration of the administrative machinery but also the absorption of the existing services of the Boards of Guardians in the several specialised ser-vices of the Local Authorities to whom the functions of the Guardians are to be transferred.44,   The Maclean Committee recommended that.-(a) The provision at the expense of the rates, with or without Exchequer grants, for the sick and infirm (includ-ing maternity and infancy and the aged requiring institutional care and all institutions appropriated to any of these), should be made by the Council under Public Health Acts suitably extended.     The Council should organise such pre-preventive and curative treatment as the cases individually require by means of their specialised institutions and medical staff *(b) The provision for all children able to attend school (including residential and special schools of all kinds) should be regarded as predominantly a matter of educational training, and should be mads by the Local Education Authority under the Education Acts suitably extended.(c) The provision for the mentally deficient, and for persons of unsound mind, whether certified or not, including all institutions appropriated to these classes, should be made by the Council under the Lunacy and Mental Deficiency Acts, suitably extended, and through the Committee or Committees administering their powers under these Acts.45,   It will, however, be agreed *&amp;b&amp; neither the
translation of this doctrine into the form of a statu-tory enactment, nor the solution of the complicated problems to which its practical application must in-inevitably given rise, can be accomplished without con-siderable difflcluty.46,   What is implied in the phrase &quot;Abolition of the Poor Law&quot;?     As is stated above, the intention was not only that the health services should be transferred from the Boards of Guardians to the County and Municipal Authorities, but also that these services should cease to be administered under the Poor Law Statutes and orders. Prom this it would seem to follow that the Poor Law Statutes should be repealed, and the orders rescinded. But this is not a task to be lightly undertaken, and before embarking upon it it will be necessary to forecast the consequences and endeavour to appraise their gravity. If the Poor Law la abolished It must be reasonably clear what it is that is being destroyed.47.   In the first place will the right to relief be destroyed?   Is the right to relief a statutory right or a common&apos; law principle?    And what will be the effect of repealing the Statutes upon which such a large and im-portant body of case law has been based?48.   It is evident that these questions would require the most careful and critical examination before any attempt could be made to oraw the headss of a Bill?     For the present purpose it will perhaps be sufficient to draw attention to the evidence&apos; given by the Legal Adviser of Local Government Board before the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws (questions 74 to 79), in which he gave a description of the early Poor Law legislation, of the true place and value of the Poor Relief Act, 1601, and
of the common law origin of the characteristic features of the existing Poor Law system.49.   Without attempting to prejudge the outcome of this examination, it may be useful to indicate some of the possible courses which might be taken:-(1) All the Acts relating to the relief of the poor might be repealed in their entirety.     If this were done it would probably be necessary to reaffirm explicitly the statutory right to relief, as well as to lay down the powers and duties of the authorities entrusted with the administration of the health and other transferred services and the conditions under which those services should be rendered.(2) All the Acts relating to the relief of the poor might be repealed with the exception of the Act of Elizabeth.     This was the suggestion made by the authors of the Minority Report, who considered that thereby they would preserve&quot; the statutory right to relief.(3) The repeal mlght.be limited to those parti-cular provisions of the Acts relating to the relief of the poor which appeared to be inconsistent with the new doctrine,    This course seems to be open to objection on the ground that, while it would require a meticulous examination of every provision of every Poor Law statute, it would still not obviate tho necessity for constructing a fresh code designed to give effect to the accepted principles of reform.   To this it may he added that the intention of some of the existing and particularly the older statutory provisions is obf?oure, that many of these provisions are obsolete and unsuitable to modern requirements, and that the essential provisions contained in over 300 Acts of parliament relating directly or in-directly to the relief of the poor could be very well
2 $9compressed into a much smaller and more convenient compass.50.   There remains to be considered what is perhaps the most difficult and troublesome question of ail,   What is the exact intention and precise effect of the Maclean Com-mittee&apos;s recommendations that provision for the sick and infirm should in the future be made &quot;under public Health Acts suitably extended&quot;;   that provision for all children able to attend school should be made &quot;under the Education Acts suitably extended&quot;;   and that provision for the mentally deficient and for persons of unsound mind should be made &quot;under the Lunacy and Mental Deficiency Acts suitably extended?&quot;    Under what conditions is the Home Assistance Committee to give assistance in the home of the recipient, or the Unemployment committee to make provision for the able-bodied unemployed or vagrants?51.   The way in which these questions are to be answered will necessarily depend upon the ambit of the pro-posed legislation.   It would not perhaps be difficult to work out a complete paper scheme, but the practical difficulties both of securing the necessary legislation and putting such legislation into force would be very serious;   and on the whole it would seem that the better plan would be to allow the new authorities considerable latitude and to afford them an opportunity of solving these and similar problems in the course of actual day to day administration.
