CABINS T,INDIAN   POLICY.Telegram from Viceroy, dated 3rd August&apos;:, 1924.&apos;Oiroulntod hjr the Secretary ,df ;&apos;;State..for. India;,&apos;Private and personal.   Secret..  First-&apos;of four parts.Reference your secret telegram of .31st- July.-   I *understand that the documents which were under&apos;the considwr-ation of the Cabinet were my private letter&apos;and secret telegram regarding the Bengal revolutionary conspiracies.&apos; Since those were written the proposals of the;Bengal Govern-ment reached us officially (and you have received, copies by mail) and were considered by my Council on Monday, July 21st. and Friday,.July 25th,- Oh the latter date we came to our conclusions.   These conclusions were again discussed by me and my Council with Lord Lytton who attended a meeting of my Council for the purpose oh-Monday, the 28th July, and a despatch is nor/ being drafted to inform you of our&apos; conclusions.. 2.     The conclusions we arrived at ware -(1) that the question whether at :any time an emergency exists which justifies and required the resort to extra-ordinary powers by ordinance is a matter for&quot; the Governor-General to determine;(2) that at the present Juncture and on the &quot;evidence and material before him, the; Governor-Genera! in Council&apos;is &quot;&quot;&apos; not prepared to advise that such ah emergency exists&apos;; (3) that in the event of the Governor-General being at any time satisfied of the existence of such an emergency the nature and extent of the extraordinary powers to be taken should.be. substantially those proposed by the Government of Bengal; .
9 P p(f*f (4) that in the meantime the Government of Bengal shouldhe invited to consider whether, having regard to their immediate requirements, it would he advantageous to them to proceed in tho local legislature with the enactment of part one of the draft Bill, the Governor-General in Coxuioil being of opinion that the facts reported would justify this course being taken forthwith. This is subject to ;later observations in this telegram; rt II)     (5) that the Government of Bengal should be informedthat the Government of India are prepared to grant them assistance in improving their (police) intelligence arrangements;(6) that the Government of Bengal should be moved to consider whether the immediate situation could not be ameliorated by further recourse to Regulation III.In addition it was decided to address you by Despatch in order to apprise you. of the remedies whioh might have to bo brought into operation should the emergency supervene. -It was also decided to re-draft the proposed Bill to avoid the close resemblance it now has in structure and terms to portions of the Rowlafct Act.3.   I thank the Cabinet for their sympathetic references to the troubles that confront my Government and the Government of Bengal.   I shall send this part of your telegram oonfiden-tially to lord Lytton as it will be an encouragement to him in a difficult situation.4.   You will observe from paragraph 1 hereof that we have substantially already adopted the views you express for the Cabinet and I am glad that there is thus complete accord between us.   Reinforcement of police is being specifically considered by the two Governments.5,   As a result of Lord Lytton&apos;s discussion with my Council there was also agreement on all points.   Lord Lytton
^ was perhaps rather&apos;iaore disposed to view the emergencyat present existing as a justification for recourse to extraordinary remedies although he made clear that he did not ask that thoso should be adopted at the moment.art III) 6.   Our objeot in sending a Despatch is that it isessential in view of present conditions to be prepared to aot without delay if and when I am satisfied (also my Government) that the emergoncy has arisen.   Although the responsibility rests on me of issuing the ordinanoe I attach importance to carrying my Government with me. Further, I should of course request your assent before taking this aotion and should apprise you by telegram of &apos; the circumstances constituting the emergency.   We must remember that an attack upon Tegart or the murder of another European would be likely to cause inflamed situation with Europeans whioh might necessitate prompt action by Government against the revolutionaries.   Further, if Indian police officers are murdered there is danger of demoralisation in the force unless Government promptly takes measures for their protection.   You will have seen from our official telegram the text issued by the revolution-aries of the threats against the Police Force.7.   Too much importance should not be attached to the issue of this notice by the revolutionaries but it resembles the procedure of the past in Bengal whioh was followed by outrages and consequently greater significance is attached to it in Bongal,ft iv)8.   We shall do everything possible to accelerate completion of enquiry into working of dyarchy whilst avoiding any foundation for suggestion that we wish to hurry the Committee to termination of its labours.   We must avoid even appearance of hurry.   Already many written representations have been received together with requests to give supple-mentary oral evidence.
9.   I need not assure you that I should most gladly welcome opportunity of returning home to confer personally&apos; with H.Mls Government and if situation should permit of my absence from India, I would inform you immediately.   But I see little possibility of it at present for this year, The Bengal situation alone would prevent it unless there is considerable Improvement.   At present it is known that I intend as usual to spend at least a month in Calcutta from beginning of December, and I attach importance to carrying out this intention unless the revolutionary activities show marked decrease.10,   We shell send telegraphic summary of despatch when it has been signed in case we have to request your assent to prompt action.Whitehall Gardens, S.&apos;.V.I., 4th August, 1924.
