C.&apos;Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. October 24th, 1924.
RELATIVE RANK OF OFFICERS OF THE NAVY, ARMY AND AIR FORCE.At a meeting of the Cabinet held on July 2nd.,1924 (Cab. 39 (24) 14) it was agreed that this question &quot;should be referred for immediate decision to the Arbitration of the Lord Chancellor&quot;oI have heard representatives cf the Navy, Army and Air Force and, with their assistance, have endeavoured to compare the different units of the three Forces with a view to bringing the relative rank of Officers in the three Services to a common denominator.     I hoped that by this means a basis for arriving at adjudication might be reached.     I am, however, convinced that a comparison of units is an impossibility^I am unable to find a practicable solution for meeting the views of the Army and Air Force Representatives that the ages of officers in certain equal ranks of the existing scale of ranks of the three Services should approximate more closely^I consider that the dividing, as at present, of the Naval rank of Captain into tvo classes leads to complications and should be discontinued.     Captains in the Navy, Colonels, and Group Captains in the Air Force should rank equally.I am also of opinion that Commanders, Lieutenant-Colonels and Wing-Oommanders should rank equally and that the present limitation tc this equality should be abolished.Tho practico of giving special rank to Marines when afloat should be discontinued, and in all cases Marines should retain the rank appropriate to their military title.I have purposely refrained from entering into any financial considerations as they are excluded from the Cabinet&apos;s Reference.
I adjudicate that the relative rank of Officers of the three Services he as followsHATTY:.ARMY.AIR FORCE.Admiral of the Fleet.AdmiralVice-AdmiralRear-AdmiralCommodore, 1st &amp; 2nd ClassCaptainCommandor -Lieutenant-CommanderlieutenantSub-Lieut e make ntCommissioned Chief Gunner, etc.Field Marshal,.GeneralLieutenant-GeneralMa jor-General[Colonel Commandant) (Colonel on the ) (       /      Staff )ColonelLi eut lieutenant-Colone1 MajorCaptain Lieutenant2nd LieutenantMarshal of the AirAir Chief-Marshal Air marshal air Vice-Marshal Air CommodoreGroup Captain WIng 0 ommande r Squadron LeaderFligh t- Li eut enantFlying Officer (or Observer Officer)Pilot Officer.ehall Gardens, S,W.l. th.
