909 w t) oI submit herewith a memorandum for the Cabinet recommending the introduction of legislation to enable Local Authorities to trade in coal,   I also attach a copy of a letter from the Minister of Health indicating that he is prepared to give general support to my proposal.Retail house coal prices in London have already been increased - at least two weeks earlier than last winter -and as a result, I am already reoeiving a number of letters of protest.   In my view it ia important that some action in the matter of household coal distribution should be taken at once, and I shall be glad if Cabinet authority may be obtained for proceeding with the preparation of a Bill and for making an announcement   of the Government^ intention.(Sgd).

Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines rgopjmngndingr-&quot;the introduction of legislation to enable Local&quot; Authorities to trade In ooal.1*      Complaints regarding the present system of household coax distribution.Every winter questions are asked in Parliament: articles appear in the Press, and complaints are made to the Mines Department about the high price and Inferior quality of domestic coal and the difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies. 2.      Investigation by the Coal Advisory Committee in 1922.In 1922 the Coal Advisory  Committee were    asked to investigate whether there was any possibility of economising in the distribution costs or the railway freights or in anyof the various items which go to make up the prioe of ooal to the consumer.   The report of this enquiry, published in January, 1923, contained the following particulars of the items comprising the retail price of coal per ton in Central London during August 1914 and August 1922:-

&quot;mind . *,...... arises from a suspicion that..............&quot;........ intervening agenoies between the pit and the&quot;buyer are reaping undue reward. This conclusion is arrived at largely beoause of the size of the margin between the pit &quot;prioe of ooal and the actual prioe to the consumer.&quot;While on the evidence before us we accept the figures &quot;(i.e., the coal merchants&apos; figures of oosts), w* are bound &quot; to remark that those responsible for the distributing trades &quot;should take immediate steps to render possible considerable &quot;reductions in all the items.&quot; 3.       Investigations by the Secretary for Mines in 1923-24.In the winter of 1923-24 the question again became aoute and many oomplaints were received from all parts of the country about prices, qualities and shortage of supplies. I accordingly decided to look into this personally in order to ses Whether the allegations had a substantial foundation  , and if so, whether any remedy oould be found for them.(a) Coal Merchants. (I began by inviting the oo-operation of the Coal Merchants1 Federation of Great Britain.   A Conference took plaoe with   them and a series of questions was addressed to them in the hope of elucidating the situation.The results of these enquiries, which were presented to Parliament in Cmd. 2117, were unsatisfactory and inconclusive as the meroha.nt3 proved reticent on the really important points.   It is olear that the movements of price are controlled by a few leading firms in consultation, and the rest follow, but whether, on the whole these prices give large profits it is impossible to say.   The merchants did not give up*to-date figures for the items of cost that were critioised by the Committee of 3,922;    and even if they had the information would&apos; have been of doubtful value, as it is quite impossible to check the allocation of the margin
between the various items.   What is certain is that the margin has not been reduced:   and its size warrants the presumption that the retail coal trade is either inefficient in methods, or makes excessive profits, or both, and that the consumer has a real griavanoe.   For example3 it appears from the Report of the 1922 Committee that tho distribution coats, after the coal reached the merchant-a depot, amounted in 1922 in London to about 27$ of the retail price:   in Liverpool the costs were 20$: in Cardiff and Manchester 23$: and in Southampton 34$. (b) Co-oparative Societies.I also held a similar conference with the representatives of the Coal Departments of certain Co-operative Societies. A verbatim report of the discussions, with specimen analyses of the costs and profits of Co-operative Societies on the same basis a3 those placed by the merchants before the Committee of 1922, was presented to Parliament in Cmd. 2185, The scope of this enquiry was not wide enough to give results on which general conclusions can safely be based, but it appears that certain co-operative societies, at any rate, selling at about the same figure as the merchants, can make much higher profits than the merchants disclose. 4.    Remedies.If then there is a case to be met, - and I am satisfied that thera is, and the public will oertainly never be persuaded that there is not - what is the right way of meeting it?   In theory at any rate, there are three possible lines of attack.   One is nationalisation.   The second is to control prices.   The third is to make more effective the factor of competition on which, under the present system,-the public depend for their protection.Nationalisation involves the larger question of national ownership of the mines and for the present must
be ruled out.   Hor would a Bill to control prices be likely to pass in the present Parliament:   and if it did it would probably prove unworkable.   The experience of the war shows that to control price without controlling supplies and   dis-tribution is an almost hopeless task.   Moreover, it would be no remedy for the present evils in so far as the root of them is not excessive profit tut inefficient methods.   We are left with the third - and the obvious way of making competition more effective is to permit local authorities to enter the field.   So long as the ooal trade is based on competitive private enterprise this appears to me to be the natural, simple and appropriate remedy.5.      Objections to municipal trading in coal.The Ministry of Health, who have been good enough to examine my suggestions, have drawn my attention to the objections to this form of municipal trading which their experience suggests.They are of the opinion that Local Authorities are so unfavourably placed for entering into competition with merchants that either they will never embark on the enterprise, or If they do, they will incur losses   that will have&apos;   to be made up out of the rates.   The Ministry base their criticisms on the following grounds:-(a) A Local Authority is at a disadvantage in having to accumulate an expert staff, provide railway trucks, trolleys, a site for the storage of coal and supplies of coal itself.(b) The margin of profit made by the traders is not encouraging,(c) A Local Authority must incur expense by storing Coal in the summer.(d) A Local Authority must make an annual provision for repayment of capital that might be more than a trader has
to make for depreciation.(e) Municipal Labour is more expensive than private labour,(f) If a Local Authority started to trade, the existing ooal traders might, if working over a large area, as in London, be in a position to reduce their charges below those of the Local Authority and recompense themselves by raising their costs in other districts.   The Local Authority would then either have to reduce prices at the cost of the rates or be left without a market and in consequence sustain capital losses.Proposals to meet these objections.I do not reoommend that local authorities should be given a monopoly In coal distribution, or indeed that they should enter the coal trade at all unless local circumstances warrant it.   I propose that the Bill, which would apply only to Borough and Urban District Councils, should provide that if a Local Authority desires to trade in coal it must submit its proposals in writing to the Mines Department giving full details of the scheme of trading.   It would not be allowed to trade unless the Mines Department had certified in writing Its approval of the scheme, of trading.   Before doing so, the Department would be required to hold such enquiry as it thought fit and would have power to require merchants or dealers who have supplied coal to consumers in the area of the looal authority at any time during a period of twelve months preceding the submission of the proposals to furnish such accounts and statistics as may be demanded.   If the enquiry showed that the existing coal distributing organisation was able to supply the distrlot efficiently, for example, where a Co-operative Society complied with such conditions, the application by the Local Authority would be refused.   If it showed that the district was not being efficiently served by the existing merchants or
that unreasonable prioea were being charged   (and therefore that there was a likelihood of the Authority&apos;a competing successfully) the applioation would be approved.The Local Authority would be required to carry on its Goal business so far a3 possible without profit or loss.   The surplus in any year, after the necessary provision for working expenses and loan charges, would be carried to the credit of the rate funds and any losses would be chargeable to the same account. It would probably also be desirable to provide that the Mines Department, in consultation with the Ministry of Health, may at any time, after reasonable notice, withdraw approval from any scheme, which would then cease to operate.It appears to me that in certain respects a Local Authority so far from being at a disadvantage In competition with merchants,. ! would be at a positive advantage.   It already knows all about buying horses, carts and lorries and their upkeep.   If it has a gas or electricity works - and many of them have - it knows all about the purohase of coal and perhaps of wagons and may even have a site for storage with sidings    ready made.   It-is better situated for buying coal than the private trader because it has a better credit.   And since it does not need the profit that a private trader requires to make it worth his while to trade, it should be possible for It to make the necessary annual pro-vision for the repayment of capital. 7.    Conclusion.It is, I submit, Impossible for the question of household coal distribution to be left where it is.   The public are aware of the enquiries that I made at the end of last winter and they expeot something to be done.   Am attempt to provide a remedy for the defects in the present system would be popular and would, in my view, be a political asset to the Government,   For the reasons that I have given I believe that, whatever may be the objections to my proposal, any alternative proposal is open to far more serious objection.   Municipal trading in coal is by no
means a new suggestion.   All the reports of the Second Stage of the Coal Industry Commission (including that of the Coal Owners) recommended that Local Authorities should he given such powers.   Moreover, I believe that the mere threat of effective competition may be enough, and that such a measure as I suggest might well justify itself even if no Local Authority ever actually embarked on the coal trade.If the Bill is on the Statute Book by next winter it should go some way towards preventing a repetition of the storm of complaints received last winter from the public It is, In any case, important that some armounoement of the Government&apos;s intentions 3hould be made at the beginning of winter if the oircumstances so determine, and X should be glad to reoeive the sanction of the Cabinet to do this,(Sgd) E.
