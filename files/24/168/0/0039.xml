ilg DOCUMLiiT IS. THE JPRQJ^j^ a. GOVaRHMaUI,l&apos;J \J u/CRET..P.437 (24).OABIH! .THE FUTURE OF THE BRITI. SH EMPIRE EXHIBIT I Gil.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Although the question of the continuance of the British Empire exhibition in 1925 is evidently not ripe for decision, no definite proposal having been put forward, I agree that it is only prudent to discuss the matter now.     The worst of all possible solutions would be that we should be rushed by a newspaper agitation to an eleventh hour decision, in the course of which all parties, the Guarantors, the Exhibition Board, the Concessionnaires and the Exhibitors and possibly even the Dominions would unload their liabilities and responsibilities on to the home taxpayer.My own feeling is that the right policy is to close down the Exhibition at the due date, 31st October, 1924, and cut our losses.     A possible reduction by      million in the deficit after a second year&apos;s working seems to me too small a reward having regard to the risk involved.     It seems to me more likely that the Exhibition assets would be sold as a whole for a substantial sum after one year than if the Exhibition were allowed to run for a second year with gradually decreasing interest on the part of the public. The estimate of two thirds this year&apos;s attendances also strikes me as unduly sanguine for 1925.Bo figures have been adduced to show the effect which the Exhibition has had on trade.
I am sure that in any case the Government ought not t take the initiative in pressing the continuance of the Exhibition.   I would agree to the appointment of a Cabinet Committee to go into the whole question during the holidays but not to take decisions.     The final decision must, I think, rest with the Government as a whole.(Intd.)   P.S.Treasury, S.W.4th August, 1924.
