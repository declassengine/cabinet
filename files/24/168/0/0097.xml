fflSS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SKOfflST. CABINET. &apos;J ^P. 494 JC4)^-----   &apos; WAR CHARGES VALIDITY BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.My colleagues will recollect that this Bill passed the Houbs of Commons last Sessions it provided (l) for the validation of all the charges in question, except those in respect of milk licences, (S) for the voiding of any judgments obtained against the Crown in suits for refund of charges paid, and (5) for   payment of &quot;solicitor and own client costs&quot; to any plaintiff who had already instituted bona fide proceedings which were not already barred by the Indemnity Act.   The Bill was rejected by the House of Lords, and the late Government had tabled a Rosolution in the Commons to enable the Bill again to be proceeded with In the same Session, before Christmas.The introduction of a Measure to legalise the charges was promised by the Prime Minister in 1922, when President of the Board of Trade, and by the disallowing of all claims (except those for milk, which have been paid:), the State will be relieved from making any payments other than those respeoting costs, in cases which the Bill affects.If there were to be no Bill, the&apos; financial results would depend upon certain judicial decisions.   A case is being oontested against the Crown by the Felix Steamship Company, on the question whether, if proceedings are not started within one year from tho official termination of the war, they are barred by the Indemnity Act.   Tho High Court has already in another oase (the British Channel case) decided that they are so barredj and it is to be presumed that the
that the present plaintiffs propose to take their case to the Court of Appeal, and, if necessary, the House of Lords.Should the final decision uphold the High Court judgment already given - i.e. be in favour   of the Grown, - then, in the absence of the Bill, the Crown1b further disbursements, in addition to the costs above referred to, would again depend an another case, viz, that of T. &amp; S. Brooklebank v. the King.   In that case the Court of Appeal has decided that claims for repayment of oharges cannot be recovered by Petition of Right, and are properly within the jurisdiction of the War Compensation Court.   The oase is, however, under appeal to the House of Lords.   If the present judgment is upheld, the Crown will have to meet the claims made in the War Compensation Court before the time limited by the Indemnity Act, which will amount approximately to B70,000j if the judgment is reversed, the clairaB made by Petition of Right before the limiting date will also have to be met, and these amount to about  135,000.In the event, however, of the Felix Steamship Company obtaining a judgment to the effect that the limiting date under, the Indemnity Act doeB not apply to War Charges claims, then all these claims, totalling roughly  18,500,000 in the y   aggregate, would be involved.   Whatevor the result of thelegal deoisions may be, however, - if anyone is paid, then all the other claimants would have a oertain justification in demanding payment.   If they had not instituted proceedings, they oould say that they had refrained from doing so on the faith of the Government undertaking to bar all claims by statute.If a Bill is again to be introduced, there will be considerable advantage in doing this before Christmas,   prom an intimation received, it appears that the War Compensation Court proposes shortly to deal with the claimB before it, so
V 11 uthat the question of introducing the Bill and passing it into law becomes one of some urgency.   At present there is no judicial&apos;decision standing against the Crown, and it will be possible to proceed with a Bill without any provision for avoiding judgments, although this position cannot be main-tained for long, as probably before Christmas a decision in the War Compensation Court will be given against the Crown, It will be remembered that the provision avoiding judgments caused most of the debate last Session, end if it is absent from the next Bill, there ought to be no speoial difficulty In passing the measure.   The Bill would however require to be introduced on a Ways and Means Resolution which involves two stages, eaoh of which would have to be taken on different days, before the introduction of the Bill,I annex a copy of an Opinion of the Attorney General on the subject.   Apart from considerations of equity as between different classes of claimants, I think that we ought to proceed with the Bill, if there is any risk of a decision of the Court of Appeal being adverse to the Crown,   If the Cabinet decides in favour of a Bill, it will be very desirable to pass the Ways and Means Resolution in the autumn session,A decision is urgent; and I shall be grateful if this memorandum may be referred to the Home Affairs Committee at once,(Intld.)   P.L1.-0.Board of Trade,17th November, 1924,
WAR CHARGES VALIDITY BILL.OPIKIOW OP THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.(1) The points raised in the Bristol Channel case are undoubtedly difficult;   and in considering the chances of any appeal regard must be had to the inclination of the Courts to construe Statutes of Limitation as narrowly as possible, and also to the tendency of the Court of Appeal to decide against the Executive if it possibly can.   However, the judgment of Bailhache J., agrees with the opinion which I expressed on the 29th August 1923, and after re-reading that opinion, and the Judgment, I adhere to the conclusion at which I then arrived.   It follows that in my opinion the decision ought to be affirmed in the Court of Appeal.(2) In considering whether or not a War Charges Validity Bill is necessary, it must be remembered that many persons abstained from lodging a claim or presenting a Petition in reliance upon the declared intention of the Government in August 1922 to introduce such a Bill; and it is a matter for consideration whether, in view of this fact, tho Government oucht to rely upon a Statute of Li-nitations in such cases.(Sgd,) Douglas McGarel Hogg.LAW OFFICERS&apos; DEPARTMENT, 11TH NOVEMBER, 192&apos;i.
