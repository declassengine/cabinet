TUTS DOOIIi-JgHT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS 3RITABTIC MAJESTY&apos; S OOVBRMMEflTSECRET. CABINET. Copy -So.Times of Cabinet and Cabinet Committee Meetings.CP.No.495(84).Memorandum by the Minister of Health.Some considerable inconvenience is, I gather\ from time to time caused in my Department by deputations having to be postponed ;at the last minute on account of the sudden calling of a Cabinet or Cabinet Committee.    Appointments. that have been made with people in London can generally without much difficulty be postponed at short notice by telephone, but when deputations eome from a distance, particularly if the members aro drawn from different localities, considerable annoyance is caused by their postponement.    The difficulty over these deputations from a distance could be met if there were some period every week during which Ministers could bo certain that they would not, except for some grave emergency, be summoned to attend a Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee.     I suggest for the consideration of my colleagues that we might appoint for this purpose two consecutive hours between 10.30 a.m. and 6.50 p.m. arranged so as not to clash with question time, on a fixed day every week.(Intld.) - .N-..C.Ministry of Health,   . November 18th, 1924.
