[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1924.SECRET.CP. 406 (24).CABINET.POSITION OF GOVERNORS-GENERAL AND GOVERNORS IN RELATION TO PAYMENT OF SUPER-TAX.   .Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I circulate, for the consideration of my colleagues, a Memorandum which has been prepared in the Colonial Office and concurred in by the Treasury on the subject of the position of the Governors-General of the self-governing Dominions and the Governors of the Australian States in regard to the payment of United Kingdom super-tax..  J. H. T.July 1924.Memorandum.&apos;TWO claims have recently been made by Governors for exemption of a portion, of their private incomes from super-tax, under Section 5 (3) (b) of the Income Tax Act, 1918, which empowers the Treasury to allow the deduction from the assessable income of an individual in the service of the Crown abroad of such sums as they think fit &quot;for expenses which, in their opinion, are necessarily incidental to the discharge of the functions of his office.&quot; These claims raise, in an acute form, the question of the adequacy of the salaries at present paid to Governors-General and Governors by the Dominion and State Governments. *Successive Secretaries of State have been concerned for some years over the extent to which Governors-General of the self-governing Dominions (Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa) and Governors of the Australian States are compelled to draw upon their private funds to meet expenses incurred by them in the discharge of their duties.There are great difficulties in determining both the amount of such expenditure and how far it may be said to be not merely legitimate, but necessary. But, even before the war, it was known that the salaries and allowances did not nearly cover the outgoings. Since the war the difficulties have been enhanced, and there has been no general increase of emoluments to compensate for the increase of prices.The following is a summary of the most recent information available as to the expenditure which Governors-General and Governors have had to incur in excess of their official salaries and allowances : (i.) Canada. The Duke of Devonshire (Governor-General, 1916-1920) has said, in reply to a special enquiry, that, &quot;at a time of high prices,&quot; he spent, about  5,000 a year from his private means, (ii.) Australia. Lord Forster, the present Governor-General, said (May 1922): &quot;My first year&apos;s expenditure [i.e., as Governor-General of the Common-wealth in 1921] was  7,000 from private resources.  With strict economy,. I shall require a minimum of  5,000 a year from private means.&quot; (iii.) New Zealand.-Both Lord Liverpool (Governor and then Governor-General, 1912-1919) and Lord Jellicoe (Governor-General, 1920 to present time) kept careful accounts of their expenditure.  In the case of Lord Liverpool, the expenditure from private means worked out at an average of  2,150 a year.   Lord Jellicoe&apos;s exact statement of his total expenditure is as follows: for the year 1921,  14,800; 1922,  12,700; 1923,  12,550; .    in each case as compared with the official salary and allowances of j     7,500 a year. 111(352&quot;;V

Salary	10,000$	10,000$Allowances	2,500	4,000-* This allowance was increased in 1914 from 25,000 dollars.I It will be seen that the only increase in salary occurred in the case of the Governor of South Australia and in allowances in the case of the Governors-General of New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.J The. Governor-General of the Union of. South Africa acts also as High Com-missioner for the South African Territories, and in respect of this office receives a salary of  3,000 per annum from Imperial funds. A deduction of  1,000 is at present made for super-tax purposes from this salary, under Section 5 (3) (5) of the Income Tax Act, 1918.As regards allowances : in Canada the allowance of 50,000 dollars is paid to cover travelling and entertainment expenses, but, in fact, free railway travelling is provided.In New Zealand the allowance of  2,500 is paid for the salaries and expenses of the Governor-General&apos;s establishment (i.e., Private Secretaries and A.D.0.&apos;s) and for travelling expenses, but free railway travelling is provided.In the Union of South Africa the allowance of  4,000 is paid to defray the expenses of official entertainments.   Free railway travelling is provided,In Australia (the Commonwealth and the States) no such allowances are paid ; but free railway travelling is granted, and in some cases additional expenses necessitated by important official entertaioments are defrayed.It may be noted that the official figures for the increase in the cost of living in 1922 over 1914 are as follows : Canada      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 48 per cent.Australia.................,. 42     .,,New Zealand       ...      ...      ,..      .... 56Union of South Africa     ......      .... 36It does not of course follow that the ratio of increase in the necessary expenditure of a Governor-General or Governor can be determined with reference to these figures, but it seems fair to deduce that in most cases the necessary expenditure is 40 per cent, above the official salary and allowances.If the several salaries are held to be inadequate to meet the necessary expenses of posts, the natural course is to increase the salaries ; but the salaries are paid by the(iv.) Union of South Africa. His Royal Highness Prince Arthur (Governor-General, 19,20-1923) is known to have been compelled to draw on his private resources, but no definite figure is available.(v.) Australian States. As regards the Australian States, it is on record that it was estimated in 1914, by the then Governor of South Australia, that a State Governor would have to spend  1,000 a year from his own means. Present information is to the effect that this estimate should be at least doubled.A schedule is attached, showing in outline the emoluments granted in 1914 and at the present time to certain Heads of Missions to foreign States.The following table shows the pre-war and post-war salaries of Governors-General and State Governors: 
Dominions (or States) concerned, and at a time when there is a universal desire for retrenchment and economy, wherever possible, it seems very difficult to approach a Dominion Government or State Government with such a proposal, though it may be mentioned that as a special .ease in 1523 it was found possible to induce the   South Australian Government to restore the Goreraor&apos;.s salary to the level of that in Victoria and New South Wales. It should also be added that in 1922 Prince Arthur was offered an increase in the allowances of his office by General Smuts, but felt compelled to decline in view of the invidious position in which a Governor-General would be placed if an appeal was made to the Union Parliament for an increase in his allow-ances at a time when Union Government Departments &quot;were being compelled to curtail their Votes and exercise stringent economy.&quot; Moreover, from the political point of view, any general approach, to Dominion and State Governments on these lines would be open to objection as tending to raise afresh the whole question of the desirability of maintaining the system by which Governors-General and Governors are appointed from this country.There is, however, ,an alternative method of relief which might, it is thought, in many cases be of substantial assistance. This is for the Treasury to exercise the powers vested in them, ,as indicated at the beginning of this memorandum, by section 5 (3) (o) of the Income Tax Act, 1918, by prescribing the amount which may be deducted, for the purpose of super-tax, from the private income of the Governor-General or Governor, on account of necessary expenses in excess of the official emoluments of the post. (The latter emoluments being paid by the Dominion or State Government are not liable to Imperial taxation.) The late Law Officers have advised that such .a deduction may be allowed.It shoidd be pointed out (a) that this step involves acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the view that the salaries paid by Dominions and Australian States are inadequate, and (b) that the relief afforded is only partial, consisting, as it will, of the amount of super-tax on the sum by which necessary expenses are held to exceed emoluments.If the Cabinet approves this proposal, it is suggested, in order to avoid controversial examinations in detail of budgets of personal expenditure, that a maximum deduction should be fixed as shown in the following table: 		(2.)	(10 Proposed Maximum Amount of Deduction.

In the case of Canada, as the salary and allowances together come to a total of  22,000, a sum considerably more than that paid to any Ambassador, or to any other Governor-General, it was felt that no deduction could be justified.Special considerations arise in the case of the Irish Free State, and no special action in this case is suggested at the present time.
