I havo now received an important telegram from the Governor of tho Straits Settlements to whioh I invite the earnest attention of tho Cabinet. 2.     When tho suggestion for the gradual dissociation of the profits of the opium monopolies from the general revenues of the Colonies was communicated to him, the Governor and High Commissioner appointed a Committee to advise him on tho financial aspects of this proposals He now states that the Report of this Committee confirms, his own view that the acceptance of the proposal would inflict serious and possibly irremediable injury on tho finances of Malaya, especially in somo of the. Unfodorated States.   A previous telegram from the Governor on this subject will be found quoted in paragraph 35 of my memorandum of the 31st of July.3,     As a result of a Conference with his Chief Officers in the Straits Settlements and tho Federated Malay States and with the Chairman of the Malayan Opium Committee who has recently returned from leave&apos;in this country (in tho course of whioh he was.present at a Conference between tbo Foreign Office, Colonial Offloe and Home Office oalled to consider this question of opium policy), the Governor Btatse that it would be impossible to carry tho resultant
financial measures through tho legislative Council of the Colony, except by ovor-riding tho Unofficial Members of the Council by using the vote of the official majority, on the instructions of HiJ kajesty&apos;s Government; and that in tho Federated Malay States it would be impossible to carry thems unless Their Highnessos the Rulers.could be persuaded to give their personal voto in favour. In the Unfedarated Statos the necessary moasuroa could only he carried by invoicing tho rights conferred by the existing Treaties, to bring prosjure to bear on the Rulors. 4.      The Governor and High Commissioner considers that, both in the Federated Malay States and the Unfoderated . -Hates, it would be highly impolitic to bring such pressure to bear on the Rulers.   I share this viow and I could not undertake responsibility for the political consequences of disregarding it.5.      Incidentally I may observe that the Straits Settlements would bo certain to demand to bo rolieved of the Military Contribution of l/5th of tho revenue which they at present make to.us; and strong, f-rohahly irresistible, pressure for financial assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government to make good huge deficits will follow from tha Malay States, some of which will lose 40$ of their revenue. 6,       Thero is of course no doubt that when there can be a general prohibition of opium smoking by tho Chinese races in the Far East,  --he present Opium Revenues must be replaced ,.,s far as possible from other sources and so far as they cannot be replaced, social services and development must be curtailed or abandoned.   I have already indicated in paragraph 40 of my memorandum of the 31st of July what steps I am prepared to take now, in contemplation of tho eventual great sacrifice of revenue which must be faced.   But I cannot agree to a pledge of prohibition, &apos;&apos;&apos;     ;.: ;; .V;;&apos;&quot;;. -xS--. -2-
tj &quot;-iat tho end of a fixed uurahor of years (without regard to the question whether the suppression of opium smoking is thon actually enforced throughout the Par Bast) nor can I agree under ;ires.jure -from uninformed third parties who have themselves to mako no sacrifice whatever j to tie the hands of Governments and Ifative Rulers in dealing with funds which aro and for long have heen their main source of revenue, on the froe utilisation of which the maintenance of their present medical, educational and humanitarian services is still dependent.   The telegram just received from the Governor strongly emphasises this view,7.       In paragraph 25 of my previous memorandum I indicated that at that date there had not been time for the Governor and High Commissioner to obtain the views of all tho various administrations in British Malaya, on the proposals submitted by the Malayan Opium Oommittoe, The Governor reports that ha &quot;has now done so, and is in a position to state that all the Malay Governments accept generally the Committee1s Report as a working basis, and are prepared to do their best to carry out the Committee1s recommendations.   The Governor again urges that this is the only practicable course to adopt,(Intd. ) J.II.T.    .Colonial Office,30 th Hapt ember, 1924,
