[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.      September 1924,SECRET.CP. 446(24).CABINET.P 0The Situation in Bengal.Note by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the accompanying copies of telegrams, despatches, &amp;c, which have passed between the India Office and the Viceroy from 31st July to ilth September inclusive.OLIVIER.India Office, S.W. 1,15th September 1924.i1 /t;
SECRET.Telegram to Viceroy, dated 2Ast July, 1924.Private and personal. Your letter of 9th instant re Bengal conspiracies for outrages discussed by Cabinet yesterday. We desire to express our deep sympathy with yourself and Government of Bengal in your anxious and difficult position. But we. recognise equally with yourself the extremely disastrous situation which for the reasons you point out would almost certainly be produced by adoption of special repressive legislation on the lines contemplated by Lytton, and we are not as at present advised prepared to entertain such proposals. We consider that the murder conspiracy should be attacked by efficient reinforcement of the Police, and we hope that if financial assistance and loan of officers to Bengal Government for this purpose is required, you&apos;will find yourself able to afford this in full sufficiency. Please telegraph information of position in this respect. -In order to relax tension in the Indian political situation we are impressed with the expediency of accelerating completion of Enquiry into working of Dyarchy. In this connexion, in order to agree as to the next step, we contemplated suggesting to you that on completion of report of enquiry and your September session, you should come home to confer personally with Government. But we recognise the increasing, difficulties and dangers of your absence from India under present conditions, and we should be glad to hear what would be your own view as to the expediency of such a course.Telegram from&apos;&quot;Viceroy, dated 3rd August, 1924. Private and personal.  Secret.  First of four parts.Reference your secret telegram of 31st July. I understand that the documents which were under the consideration of the Cabinet were my private letter and secret telegram regarding the Bengal revolutionary conspiracies. Since those were written the proposals of the Bengal Government reached us officially (and you have received copies by mail), and were considered by my Council on Monday, 21st July, and Friday, 25th July. On the latter date we came to our conclusions. These conclusions were again discussed by me and my Council with Lord Lytton, who attended a meeting of my Council for the purpose on Monday, the 28th July, and a despatch ia now being drafted to inform you of our conclusions.2. The conclusions we arrived at were : (1.) That the question whether at any time an emergency exists which justifiesand requires the resort to extraordinary powers by ordinance is a matter for the Governor-General to determine. (2.) That at the present juncture and on the evidence and material before him,the Governor-General in Council is not prepared to advise that such anemergency exists.(3.) That in the event of the Governor-General being at any time satisfied of the existence of such an emergency, the nature and extent of the extra-ordinary powers to be taken should be substantially those proposed by the1 ; Government of Bengal.(4.) That in the meantime the Government of Bengal should be invited to - consider whether, having regard to their immediate requirements, it would be advantageous to them to proceed in the local legislature with the enactment of part one of the draft Bill, the Governor-General in Council being of opinion that the facts reported would justify this course being taken forthwith. This is subject to later observations in this telegram.(5.) That the Government of Bengal should be informed that the Government of India are prepared to grant them assistance in improving their (police) intelligence arrangements.(6.) That the Government of Bengal should be moved to consider whether the-immediate situation could not be ameliorated by further recourse tp Regulation III.7629  20  9.24   [12055] n[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government iPrinted for the Cabinet.
In addition it was decided to address you by Despatch in order to apprise you of the remedies which might have to be brought into operation should the emergency supervene. It was also decided to redraft the proposed Bill to avoid the close resemblance it now has in structure and terms to portions of the Rowlatt Act.3. I thank the Cabinet for their sympathetic references to the troubles that confront my Government and the Government of Bengal. I shall send this part of your telegram confidentially to Lord Lytton, as it will be an encouragement to him in a difficult situation.4. You will observe from paragraph 1 hereof that we have substantially already adopted the views you express for the Cabinet, and I am glad that there is thus complete accord between us. Reinforcement of. police is being specifically considered by the two Governments.5. As a result of Lord Lytton&apos;s discussion with my Council there was also agree-ment on all points. Lord Lytton was perhaps rather more disposed to view the emergency at present existing as a justification for recourse to extraordinary remedies, although he made clear that he did not ask that these should be adopted at the moment.6. Our object in sending a Despatch is that it is essential in view of present conditions to be prepared to act without delay if and when I am satisfied (also my Government) that the emergency has arisen. Although the responsibility rests on me of issuing the ordinance, I attach importance to carrying my Government with me. Further, I should of course request your assent before taking this action, and should apprise you by telegram of the circumstances constituting the emergency. We must remember that an attack upon Tegart or the murder of another European would be likely to cause inflamed situation with Europeans, which might necessitate prompt action by Government against the revolutionaries. Further, if Indian police officers are -murdered there is danger of demoralisation in the force unless Government promptly takes measures for their protection. You will have seen from our official telegram the text issued by the revolutionaries of the threats against the Police Force.7. Too much importance should not be attached to the issue of this notice by the revolutionaries, but it resembles the procedure of the past in Bengal, which was followed by outrages, and consequently greater significance is attached to it in Bengal.8. We shall do everything possible to accelerate completion of enquiry into working of dyarchy whilst avoiding any foundation for suggestion that we wish to hurry the Committee to termination of its labours. We must avoid even appearance of hurry. Already many written representations have been received, together with requests to give supplementary oral evidence.9: I need not assure you that I should most gladly welcome opportunity of returning home to confer personally with His Majesty&apos;s Government, and if situation should permit of my absence from India, I would inform you immediately. But I see little possibility of it at present for this year. The Bengal situation alone would prevent it unless there is considerable improvement. At present it is known that I intend as usual to spend at least a month in Calcutta from beginning of December, and I attach importance to carrying out this intention unless the revolutionary activities show marked decrease.10. We shall send telegraphic summary of despatch when it has been signed in case we have to request your assent to prompt action.Telegram to Viceroy, dated 8th August, 1924.Private and personal. Secret. Your private and personal secret, telegram, dated 3rd August.The policy which commends itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government is that you should as fully as possible make use of all powers under Regn. Ill or any other powers already existing which might enable you to cope with dangers of situation, rather than to make any premature demonstration of an intention on the part of the Government to invest itself with new exceptional powers. Either course may equally be denounced as arbitrary, but the latter seems to us likely to provoke the more violent outcry.We should, therefore, desire opportunity of very careful consideration of any proposed new legislation whether by ordinance or in Bengal Council.   In para-
graph 6 you express your intention to request assent of His Majesty&apos;s Government before taking action by ordinance. I presume that you intend that this procedure should apply equally to any proposal that Government of Bengal should proceed as suggested in paragraph 2 (4) of your telegram with enactment of any special legisla-tion in the Bengal Council, even of a partial character, but I should be glad to be assured on this point.I am somewhat puzzled by the apparent discrepancy between your para-graph 2 (2), which suggests that you do not consider an emergency exists, and paragraph 2 (4), where the Bengal Government are invited to consider whether they should proceed with enactment of Part I of a draft Bill. Do you draw a distinction between degree of emergency legally required for exceptional process of passing ordinance under Section 72 of the Act, and degree of emergency which may be held to justify enactment of provisions of Part I of Bill by ordinary legislative process? If so, this distinction, which is one of degree, should not in our view affect the wider distinction drawn in my paragraph 1 between creation of new powers and use of existing powers.Telegram from Viceroy, dated 11th August, 1924.Private and personal. Secret. Your private and personal secret telegram, 8th August. I am in complete accord with the policy which commends itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government. I have throughout urged the continued and, if necessary, wider use of powers under Regulation III. You are correct in assuming that I should consult His Majesty&apos;s Government before having recourse to exceptional measures of an ordinance or sanction for special repressive legislation by Bengal Legislative Council even of a partial character, such as enactment only of Part I of the proposed Bill.I am telegraphing officially summary we are forwarding this mail. It will explain the passage which puzzled you in my private and personal secret telegram of 3rd August. We are examining the situation with the Government of Bengal regarding the feasibility of proceeding only with Part I of the Bill should the emergency occur. Our purpose is to arrive beforehand at conclusions in order that, if necessary, prompt action may be taken. In any event, I should only recommend action of even limited enactment of Part I of the proposed Bill after the emergency had been established to my satisfaction, and I should consult His Majesty&apos;s Government before taking action.Despatch No. 2 of 1924 from Government of India to India Office.Simla,My Lord, Qth August, 1924.We have the honour to submit, for your Lordship&apos;s consideration, the Govern-ment of Bengal&apos;s Secret letter No. 6721-P., dated the 10th July, 1924, and its accompaniments, and to acquaint you, as precisely as the present situation permits, with our conclusions on its important contents.2. As Your Lordship is aware, we were, nearly a year ago, addressed by the Government of Bengal in their Secret letter* No. 8188-P., dated the 28th August, 1923, a copy of which is in Your Lordship&apos;s hands, regarding the political situation in Bengal and the measures necessary to deal with it. In our telegram No. 733, dated&apos; the 6th September, 1923, we communicated to the Noble Lord your predecessor the substance of this letter, the conclusions which we had formed upon it and the course which we at that time considered expedient to deal with the situation as it then stood. We have now been again addressed in the most urgent terms by the Govern-ment of Bengal, who, in renewing their demand for the substance of the proposals which they made last year and which we were then reluctant to concede, have repre-sented so material an alteration and, we regret to say, so serious a deterioration in the circumstances which then subsisted, and. on grounds so cogent, that a reconsideration of the situation and of the remedies to be applied is clearly imperative.* Not printed.[1^055] &apos; b 2
3. The situation reported by the Government of Bengal and the measures which they now propose for dealing with it obviously raise questions of the utmost importance, which cannot fail, in whatever sense they are answered, to have serious consequences not only in Bengal, but throughout India. On the judicial evidence alone, and apart from ampler and not less credible evidence from other sources, we have incontestable proofs of the formidable recrudescence of a revolutionary conspiracy aimed at the violent subversion of Government. The fact has been established in the Courts, and the causes and concomitants of the failure of the prosecutions in the Alipur and Chittagong cases are in many respects hardly less convincing than the.recent successful prosecutions, such as those of the murderer of Mr. Day and of the accused concerned in the manufacutre of bombs and the illicit possession of arms.4. The consequential issues, grave as they are, can nevertheless be comparatively simply stated, and they are as follows : (1.) Are the existing powers of the law sufficient to enable this revolutionaryorganisation to be suppressed ? (2.) If not, what is the nature of the powers which are indispensably necessaryfor this purpose ? (3.) At what stage should such powers be put into operation ?5. The first and third of these involve what may be called variable factors. We can form an estimate, on a basis of fact, of the effect of the application during the last year of Regulation III, and of the present state of affairs in Bengal, but we have also to take into account and endeavour to appreciate the probable future develop-ments of the revolutionary movement itself and the probable effects, direct and indirect, of the measures proposed on the general political situation. This is a wider enquiry, which demands not merely the examination of ascertained or ascertainable data, but a forecast of probabilities of the future, and it can only be concluded after a survey of the whole position has been completed.6. For an answer to the second issue, we have available the results of the exhaustive discussions and the practical experience of over twenty years. The measures now proposed are substantially those which were pressed for before the war by the Government of Bengal, which were used with success during the war and for the necessity of which, in dealing with a revolutionary conspiracy, when the resources of the ordinary law have been proved to be exhausted, the Government of Bengal can point to an impressive consensus of opinion from successive Governments, and from judicial, administrative and executive officers with every variety of experience. The essentials of these measures resolve themselves into these executive powers of arrest and search and of detention for a limited period without warrant by officers empowered in this behalf by the local Government, powers to be exercised by the local Government without judicial proceedings, of detention or of internment or of the imposition of lesser restrictions on liberty, and the provision of special tribunals with special rules of procedure. Assuming, therefore, the existence of a state of affairs in which&apos;a revolutionary movement has successfully defied the ordinary law, it seems unnecessary to attempt to go behind the prolonged laborious and exhaustive enquiries of the past and the ascertained results of experience. On tne question, therefore, if extraordinary powers are necessary, what should be their nature and extent, we would definitely accept these results and, in consequence, the substance o E this part of the Bengal Government&apos;s proposals.7. It must be observed that the Bengal Government rely to a large extent on the success attained by the measures taken under the war legislation. This requires some comment and perhaps some qualification. In the accompaniment to their letter No. 8111-P., dated the 28th August, 1923, they claim that the revolutionary campaign which attained its zenith during the years 1914-17 was finally crushed, after all other expedients had failed, by the measures then taken which &quot; entirely smashed up the revolutionary caucus and resulted in a total cessation of revolutionary crime.&quot; That this was substantially true cannot, we think, be questioned. It would be too much to expect that the results of measures, which, were as lenient as the circumstances permitted, which were essentially preventive rather than punitive, and which were withdrawn in the hope that they would no longer be necessary, should be permanent. .What the Bengal Government actually claim must, we think, be admitted. It cannot, however, be ignored that war conditions were favourable to and undoubtedly contributed to their success. The liberty of the subject had to yield in many directions to the supremalex.  Government at that time possessed large powers
of control over the press and a strict censorship over the publication of news and comment could be, and was, enforced. They had, moreover, a majority in the Legis-lative Council, and could meet effectively resolutions or other action proposed in the legislature. For these reasons, political opposition was reduced to a minimum, and there was the additional justification of the special peril to a state at war of internal revolutionary activities. If, therefore, war conditions contributed materially to the success of the powers then taken, there may be some room for doubt whether in peace time and in less favourable political circumstances the same results would necessarily be attained, but at least they offer the best chances of success, and no effective alternatives to them have been put forward.8. The conclusion to be drawn from these considerations is that, if and when a stage is reached at which it can be established that the present law is insufficient to prevent the revolutionary movement from becoming an imminent danger to peace and good government, extraordinary powers must be invoked and must be, in nature and extent, substantially those now proposed by the Government of Bengal. In dealing with organised crime on an extensive scale, action which aims primarily at pre-caution and prevention has often proved more efficacious in its results and milder in its operation than drastic changes in penal law and procedure, and the more efficacious it can be made, the more speedily can the conditions which render it necessary be terminated.9. Decisions on these points are comparatively easy. Experience and reason point only in one direction, so long as the axiom is accepted that the fundamental duty of Government is to preserve public security, on which political advance and all the functions of a civilised social organism depend. It would be abdication of government to permit a revolutionary organisation to pursue its course and perfect its machinery to a stage which would enable it to suspend the rule of law and deprive the Government of its authority. The difficult problem is to determine the stage at which extraordinary powers must be taken and put into operation.10. A year ago the Government of Bengal asked for powers substantially the same as those for which they now renew their demand. The Government of India were not then prepared to grant the powers asked for though they admitted that in the ultimate resort extraordinary legislation might be necessary, and there was little doubt as to the character of the legislation. They said: &quot; The Government of India agree with the Bengal Government regarding the measures which may eventually be necessary to cope successfully with a movement of this nature.&quot; In refusing the powers then asked for and in granting recourse under certain conditions, to Regulation III of 1818, we were moved by the following considerations. On the positive side, and in addition to the inherent dangers of a revolutionary conspiracy in being, there were the admitted greater facility in obtaining arms, the definite connection with M. N. Roy and the communist organization and a suspected associa-tion with certain elements in the Swarajya party. On the negative side were the general atmosphere of hostility which undoubtedly then prevailed to any organization for promoting outrage, the view that the conspiracy could now be treated as simply anarchical and revolutionary, without any connection with a popular political object, such as the anti-partition agitation lent.to the earlier phases of the movement and the fact that the overt activities of the movement did not then supply a case which could be made convincing to the public of the necessity&apos; of the remedies proposed. The Government of India, therefore, offered, as an experimental measure, the renewed recourse to the Regulation of 1818 on a more extended scale. -11. That estimate of the situation appeared, at the time, sound and justified by immediate results. The resort to the Regulation had a marked effect for a considerable period on the most active revolutionary organization, the Yugantar. But this remedy, for its permanent effect, relied on other factors which have failed. Public opinion has not consolidated into open or active opposition to the conspiracy. Though the most powerful argument in favour of special measures, which in private would be conceded by many men in the public life of Bengal, is the still lively recollection of the misery and terror created by the revolutionary movement from the years 1912 to 1917, the Government of Bengal are nevertheless unable to anticipate any public support for these measures in the Legislature or elsewhere. Other leaders have sprung up to replace those confined under the Regulation, most of these being fanatical young men under little or no restraint from the older conspirators who&apos; have learnt by experience some measure of prudence and caution. Projects of assassination continue to be devised and the public threat contained in the notice (Enclosure No. 3) appended to this despatch, which has recently been sent to certain
officials in Calcutta and posted up at various places in the city, is a matter of grave significance. Leaflets of this type have not come to notice for nine or ten years and their appearance was then accompanied or followed by murderous outrages. In other respects also the situation has gravely deteriorated. As a result partly of action taken in India, and partly of the negotiations now pending between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Soviet Republic, the communist menace has receded but it is still in the background. Our latest information indicates an intention on the part of the Soviet Government to renew and reinforce their propaganda in India. On the other hand, the connection between the revolutionaries and at least a powerful section of the Swarajist party in Bengal has received definite and indisputable confirmation. This is by far the most important and sinister of recent developments. The financial resources, which there is now good reason to believe to be at the disposal of the revolutionaries, represent not only the most dangerous form of political corruption but relieve them from the necessity of resorting to the kind of outrage-the so-called political dacoity which did more than anything else to arouse public detestation of their policy and methods.12. This obviously gives a significance and a direction to the movement such as it has never before obtained in the long history of revolutionary activities in Bengal. The revolutionaries, who hitherto could only command the veiled sympathy of a few extremist newspapers and politicians, have now a patron and collaborator in the leader of the most powerful political party in Bengal, who is also as Mayor the Dictator of the Corporation of Calcutta with large funds and patronage at his disposal. It is unnecessary to comment on this aspect of the case further than to say that the evidence adduced by the Government of Bengal establishes the fact that, whether from a conviction that violence, or the threat of violence, is the sole road to the realisation of national aspirations, or because they have committed themselves too deeply to withdraw, Mr. C. R. Das and his following are involved in the movement. It is unnecessary to determine which of these alternatives is correct as the effect is the same. For the first time the revolutionaries can command from a political party public countenance, secret subsidies and executive offices in a great corporation and can contribute in return organised support in election campaigns and at political meetings and votes in a legislature. This may clearly create a situation which it will be our duty to suppress at whatever cost and whatever risk.13. We consider, therefore, that the Government of Bengal are justified in arguing that resort to the Regulations, as an effective and permanent remedy, has failed, that the present situation holds graver and more imminent potentialities of danger to the State than it did a year ago and that recourse to extraordinary powers is a question that must immediately be faced and on which prompt and resolute action may become imperative. But the question obviously cannot be considered as a domestic concern of the Presidency of Bengal. We recognise that the re-enactment for any part of India, particularly the part most vocal, politically the best organised and most prone in the stress of agitation to extreme courses, of the operative provisions of legislation which we so recently deemed it expedient to repeal, could not be restricted to a provincial controversy. We are keenly aware of the contingent danger of a reunion on a popular issue not only of the jarring sections of the Congress, but even of parties still adhering to a constitutional policy, and a great access to the prestige and forces behind the Swarajists. We have carefully weighed the possibility that this might lead to a general adoption of obstructive and wrecking tactics, to a revival of the campaign of civil disobedience and perhaps, unless wiser counsels prevail in the matter of its relations with the revolutionaries, to a conflict, not with individuals or associations, but with the most highly organised political party in India. If, in contingencies like, this, the present system of Government became definitely inoperable, the Swarajist party, to whom such a result is an avowed object, would, doubtless, endeavour to transfer the onus and odium to what would be described as the adoption by the Government of India of coercive legislation.14. These are considerations of the most momentous consequence, but they must be confronted as soon as it can be established that the revolutionary movement can be controlled by no other means. It is clear that there are two decisions of fundamental importance to be taken, the first as to the nature of the powers which, in the contingency supposed, will be necessary, and the second as to the time at which thev should be put into operation. As to the first, we have already indicated our acceptance in substance of the proposals of the Government of Bengal. We have come to this conclusion having due regard not only to the support which the
Government of Bengal are entitled to expect from us in the grave crisis which confronts them but also to the more extensive responsibilities which devolve upon us and upon the Governor General for the peace and security of India, and we are confident that we can equally rely upon the support of Your Lordship and of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Government of Bengal seem further to suggest that the stage at which action must be1 taken should be left to their discretion. This is a proposition in which we cannot concur. We agree that if, when the time comes, action is to be immediately effective, the interval which must necessarily elapse before any measure can be enacted in the provincial or the Indian Legislature must be covered by an Ordinance. If the exigencies of the crisis permit, we -recognise our obligation to submit, for the concurrence of Your Lordship and His Majesty&apos;s Government, the immediate grounds on which we propose to take or to advise action. But we have no doubt that Your Lordship will agree that nothing can absolve the Governor General from his statutory responsibility to take such action as he deems imperative on the occurrence of an-emergency which brooks no delay. We consider these propositions so clear that it is unnecessary to elaborate argument in their support.15. In this broad survey of the situation we have necessarily omitted many considerations of undoubted importance in themselves and have confined ourselves to the fundamental issues. &apos; We have considered whether any intermediate measures could profitably be undertaken.   The improvement of the intelligence service of the Government of Bengal is one of these, which, if found necessary, could be undertaken without reference or prejudice to the contents of the draft Bill.   To this we are directing the immediate attention of the Government of Bengal and we are inviting them to inform us whether and in what way we can be of assistance to them.  We are also moving them to consider whether the immediate situation could not be relieved by further resort to the Regulation.   But apart from preliminaries within this scope, we are persuaded that no intermediate steps could be adopted as a permanent remedy and as a complete substitute for those contemplated in the whole Bill.   We are convinced that to proceed by instalments, except within the limited scope and for the immediate objects above indicated, would be to invite, by longer or shorter stages, a situation in Bengal, and most probably by contagion in other provinces, in some of which there is a soil more ready for infection than when the revolutionary movement was last most active in Bengal, which would compel us ultimately to take more drastic measures and in far more unfavourable circumstances.   We must reiterate that one of the objects most present to our minds is that the suspension of the ordinary law of the land, if that condition becomes inevitable, should be restricted in its degree, in the area of its application and in the period of its operation within the narrowest possible limits, and this object can only be obtained by making it at the outset immediately effective.   Meantime, it is of obvious importance that all preparatory and preliminary action that is possible should be taken.   We are, in particular, examining in consultation with the Government of Bengal, the question whether it would be feasible and advantageous to proceed separately and in advance with the enactment of the local legislature of Part I of the Bill.   We desire in this and in other ways to bring matters to a stage at which nothing will remain for decision except the moment to act. 16. We have therefore arrived at the following conclusions :  (1.) That the question of whether at any time an emergency exists which justifies and requires the resort to extraordinary powers is a matter in the first instance for the Government of India.   The responsibility for sanction to the introduction of special legislation or for the issue of an Ordinance lies upon the Governor-General.   If it is decided that it is necessary to use extraordinary powers, the approval of the Secretary of State and His Majesty&apos;s Government would ordinarily be sought before taking action; but in a crisis necessitating immediate action the Governor General might be forced to act forthwith and report his action for approval afterwards. (2.) That at the present juncture and on the evidence and material available,we are not prepared to hold that such an emergency has arisen. (3.) That in the event of such an emergency being established, the nature and extent of the extraordinary powers to be taken should be substantially those proposed by the Bengal Government.17. We commend these propositions to Your Lordship&apos;s most urgent consideration.   The immediate state of affairs has permitted us to communicate &quot;to
you, as was evidently most proper if the exigencies of the case permitted, our considered conclusions by despatch, but as very serious developments may occur at any time, which may call for immediate action, we should be deeply grateful for an intimation by telegram of Your Lordship&apos;s views. As regards the substance and the operative provisions of the legislation which may be required, we have already stated our conclusions. As regards its precise form and the procedure which it may be found most convenient to adopt, many matters of importance within this more limited scope remain to be determined. We are proceeding with the examination of the Bill, Part I of which at least raises important questions as to how far its enactment is within the legislative powers of the local Council in the form in which it has been drafted and we are, in particular, considering the advisability of redrafting, with a view to avoid as far as possible, in title, arrangement and language the features of previous measures which were especially obnoxious to public opinion. These are details which will involve further communications with the Government of Bengal, the results of which we shall intimate with the least possible delay. We trust, however, that we have placed Your Lordship sufficiently in possession of the fundamental issues and of the considerations which have moved us in laying these weighty proposals before you to enable you to signify the decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government and to empower us to proceed, on the lines we propose, as circumstances may render necessary.We have, &amp;c.i.

MlTRA.Enclosure 2 in above.From Chief Secretary to the Government of Bengal to the Government of India,Home Department.No. 6721 P. Calcutta,Sir, July 10, 1924.Report on the Political Situation in Bengal and the measures necessary to deal with it.I am directed to refer to Mr. Birley&apos;s letter No. 8111 P, dated the 28th August, 1923, on the above subject, with which was enclosed a note on .the revolutionary conspiracy as it then existed in Bengal. In that letter a r&amp;ume&apos; was given of the history of the measures taken during the years 1910-1918 to deal with the revolu-tionary conspiracy and the following- conclusion was drawn: &quot;Two facts appear to the Governor in Council to be incontrovertibly proved from the papers of which a resume has been given above firstly that, in spite of differences of opinion to start with, all authorities, Governments, high judicial officers, administrators and police were eventually driven by experience to the unanimous conclusion that it is impossible to fight a revolutionary conspiracy or deal with revolutionary crime under the ordinary law or through the ordinary machinery of the courts, and that special powers, and those of an extra-judicial nature, are indispensably necessary. Secondly, that these authorities are equally unanimous that powers given under the. Defence of India Act and Rules, with Regulation III in the background, have proved successful to this end and that no other powers have ever been suggested as reasonably effective. His Excellency in Council definitely and unhesitatingly accepts these conclusions and is of opinion that no other powers will enable him to discharge his responsibilities for the peace of Bengal.&quot;The Governor in Council accordingly asked that certain powers on the lines of the Defence of India Rules might be granted by an Ordinance and undertook to introduce the necessary legislation or such part of it as the Legislative Council was competent to pass.
2. The Government of India expressed their agreement with this Government as to the measures which might eventually be necessary to any attempt to cope successfully with a revolutionary conspiracy. They considered, however, that it would be inexpedient to Issue an Ordinance of the nature indicated. They based this decision on the grounds that the evil was localised in Bengal; that the overt acts which could be demonstrated as due to the conspiracy were of a limited nature and the majority of the section responsible were under arrest; that without a dangerous disclosure of the source of police information it could not be proved to the public that the situation justified so strong a measure, and that the criticism which would follow, coming at a time when the elections were approaching, might entirely destroy the atmosphere favourable to the introduction of exceptional legisla-tion which was believed.to exist in Bengal and would have consequences detrimental to the position of Government in other provinces. They recognised that some immediate action was necessary and admitted the use of Regulation III of 1818, provided that it was employed&apos; solely against persons known or reasonably believed to be members of an anarchical or&apos; revolutionary conspiracy, that they should be such as the Governor in Council believed it to be essential to arrest in order to prevent, the spread of the conspiracy or the committing of crime and that the Governor-General in Council was satisfied of the necessity for such action in each case before the warrant was issued. Warrants were accordingly issued against 19 persons in September 1923. One of these was under trial in the Alipore conspiracy case and fifteen were arrested within a few days. Three absconded. One of these absconders was arrested in March 1924. The other two have so far succeeded in evading arrest.3. The sudden unexpected blow which was dealt deprived the revolutionary organisation of its leaders at a time when preparations had not been made to replace them, and for a time it wa.s paralysed, but not for long. The overt activities were resumed on the 14th December, 1923, when at Chittagong a section of the Jugantar party whose chief organiser is Nagendra Sen committed a robbery of Rs. 17,000&quot;, the property of the Assam-Bengal Railway Company. This was followed ten days later by a running fight between this gang and a party of police and villagers, in the course of which two of the gang were arrested with firearms in their possession. These two were ultimately found not guilty by a jury, while Ananta Singh, one of the gang, is still under trial in the robbery case. On the 24th May, 1924, an attempt was made on the life of one of the chief witnesses in that case, and on the next evening a Sub-Inspector who had arrested Ananta Singh in Calcutta and was particularly dangerous to this section of the revolutionaries, as he knew them by sight, was shot by a revolutionary named Premananda Datta. In the enquiry-preliminary to commitment the principal witness who had arranged several meetings between the Sub-Inspector and the accused resiled from his statement on this point, before the police, and later informed the officer in charge of the case that although he knew he had done wrong, he would otherwise have lost his life.4. Again, on the 12th January, Mr. Day was murdered in Calcutta by Gopi Nath Shaha, a member of Santosh Mitra&apos;s group, by mistake for Mr. Tegart, the Commissioner of Police, who had been the main object of the attention of the revolutionaries since April 1923. In consequence of this outrage, five persons, who had succeeded the leaders who had been arrested in September, were arrested and detained under Regulation III. Later at the beginning of February warrants were issued for the detention of three important members of the revolutionary party, viz., Nagendra Nath Sen alias Juki, the leader of the Chittagong section, Debendra Nath De alias Khoka, an absconder in the Alipore conspiracy case, and Nripendra Nath Mukharji, who had been detailed to watch Mr. Tegart, but all of them have successfully evaded arrest. At the beginning of March, action was taken against Puma Das, the leader of the Madaripur party, who had been released from jail only at the peginning of the year, but had at once thrown himself vigorously into the ;^s!&apos;filiation plpt and had speedily and effectively reorganised his followers, formerly i-:is the &quot;Santi Senas.&quot;5. On the 15th March a bomb factory was discovered in Calcutta and enquiries in that case led to the recovery of one of the Mauser pistols which had been stolen from Messrs. Rodda and Co. in 1914. Almost simultaneously a member of the Pabna section was severely injured by an explosion whilst he was making a bomb at Faridpur. 16. Such have been the activities of the revolutionary party which have come into publicity, but there are also incidents not generally known which have come to the knowledge of this Government.  The assassination plot has all along been the [12055] - c
foremost object of the revolutionaries next&apos;to the improvement of th^r organisation-Mr. Tegart, the Commissioner of Police, is their main objective. The murder of Mr. Day, which was actually a daring attempt on the life of Mr. Tegart, has already been mentioned. On the night of the 20th February three men were deputed to attack Mr. Tegart, who was expected to visit the bathing ghat on the occasion of the lunar eclipse, and at the end of the same month preparations were made to blow up the train in which he was travelling near Santahar. On the 13th April another European, Mr. Bruce, was mistaken for Mr. Tegart and was fired at in Harrison Road, but was fortunately not hit. On the night of the 10th June two parties went out to assassinate Mr. Tegart whilst he was dealing with the anti-Sikh riots. A number of youths have been noticed loitering on the routes which he usually takes, though their object seems to have been chiefly to identify him for future occasions, as although several of them have been questioned and have made unsatisfactory statements, they have not actually been found in the possession of arms. That Mr. Tegart has escaped so far is little short of a miracle, and is probably due to the fact that the would-be assassins have usually made their attempts in circumstances which would give them a good chance of escape. But it is merely a matter of time before more fanatics of the type of Gopi Nath Shaha are forthcoming.7. There are also several Indian officers whose assassination has been considered by the revolutionaries, but they seem to have decided to concentrate on the assassination of Mr. Tegart in the first instance, partly, because if this were carried out, their prestige would be immensely increased and the morale of the police would, they hope, be seriously affected, and partly because they fear that the assassination of other officers might lead to precautions which would make the assassination of Mr. Tegart more difficult. The movements of these officers have nevertheless been watched, and an incident occurred on the night of the 30th May which raised strong suspicions that a plot was afoot to bomb the. Special Branch Barrack in which some of these officers reside at Bhowanipur. That the revolutionaries will not be content with the murder of police officers only, and that their aims are even more extended, is evidenced by the fact that the Legislative Council Chamber was reconnoitred in January last with a view to the commission of a bomb outrage.8. The above is a brief account of the acts of violence or intended violence which have taken place during the past ten months. A more detailed account will be found in Enclosure 1* The most sinister development, however, has been the increasing and now hardly concealed identification of the revolutionaries with the Swaraj party. This party is the only political party in Bengal which possesses an efficient organisation, and it owes its organisation very largely to the revolutionaries, though the latter for the most part remained in the background as far as the Legislative Council is concerned. The capture of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee gave the party money, and the control of this money gave it immediate success and the power to make more money. In the days of the old revolutionary conspiracy, even when they were well organised, the revolutionaries lacked funds and were driven to commit dacoities &quot;in order to obtain them, with the result that they ran risks and to some extent alienated popular sympathy. They are now in a position to obtain money otherwise, and this accounts for the fact that whilst their organisation is growing very rapidly, political dacoity, which was a feature of the situation a year ago, has ceased.9. The absence of dacoities may tend to obscure to the public eye the existence of the strength of the revolutionary party, and not perhaps until assassinations again begin to take place will the public be fully persuaded that such an organisation is in existence. At the same time recent events connected with the Swaraj party have caused alarm, although the connection between this party and the revolutionaries may not be generally appreciated. The earlier history of the connection between the revolutionaries and the Swaraj party is embodied in a note which was written at the beginning of March (Enclosure 2).* The association has since become closer. The Swarajists have captured the Calcutta Corporation, a feat which has ensured ample funds for the party chest, and have appointed C. R. Das as Mayor and Subash Bose as Chief Executive Officer. One of their first acts, was to call for applications for assistance from those who had worked and suffered in the country&apos;s cause. The alliance was sealed at the Sirajganj Conference at the beginning of June. The split between C. R. Das and Gandhi had just occurred, and the Swarajists needed help against the no-changers on the questions of Council-entry and the Hindu-Moslem Pact, opposition to which bid fair to be serious.  Assistance was rendered by the* Not printed.
nrevolutionaries, of whom Suren Ghosh, alias Madhu (perhaps the most active leader at the present moment), and. other leaders brought more than 500 delegates. They completely dominated the proceedings and the Swarajists emerged triumphant. Their price was primarily the Gopi Nath Shaha resolution which, in the form in which it was passed, was a direct incitement to the youth of Bengal to follow the example of the murderer. Mr. Das&apos;s subsequent version of the resolution makes little real difference to it; in the eyes of unbalanced youths it would make none at all. The resolution was a triumph for the revolutionaries, and the Swarajists have thrown off the threadbare cloak of non-violence, though the public, who do not know the inner history, naturally find it incredible that Mr. Das, who went to jail as a martyr in the cause of non-violent non-co-operation and was a leading barrister in Calcutta, should have any sympathy with the cult of assassination. The second advantage to the revolutionaries was a large accession of funds. It is saicl that they received 15,000 Rs., and a promise of a further 75,000 Rs. They have also established their ascendancy in the Swaraj party and a very large claim on the party funds.10. The present position is therefore very serious in some ways more serious than it was in 1915. The present organisation has not had as long a start as the former one, and the Anushilan, which was broken up very thoroughly, has not yet fully recovered. The organisation of the Jugantar received a set-back last September. But it has now more than made up the lost ground and the present leaders have not repeated the mistake of failing to provide for men to succeed them in the event of their arrest. The number of their followers was strikingly illustrated at Sirajganj, and though all of these youths may not at the moment be dangerous, the large majority will certainly become so if measures are not taken to deal with the organisation. The revolutionaries now have active members in high places, including four or five members of the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive Officer of the Calcutta Corporation, besides supporters like C. R. Das and Byomkesh Chakravartti, and, above all, they have access to large sums of money with which they can secure arms and perfect their organisation without the necessity of having recourse to dacoity. That the ordinary machinery of the courts-has again broken down is instanced by the results of the Alipore conspiracy trial and the case at Chittagong referred to above.11. The Governor in Council has given the situation his most anxious consideration and is convinced that&apos; it will be impossible to prevent the spread of the movement, which has already&quot; reached dangerous dimensions, unless the net is cast much wider. The use of Regulation III of 1818 has been most valuable in dealing with a comparatively small number of leaders in the earlier stages of organisation, but it is not a suitable weapon for dealing. with the revolutionary conspiracy at the stage which it has now reached. In the first place, it is too drastic. A few even of those who have already been detained might have been adequately dealt with by internment instead of being kept in jail. It is now very necessary to act on a far wider scale and to deal not only with leaders, but&apos; with those who are ready to succeed as leaders, and with potential assassins. Many of these persons could be adequately dealt with by being domiciled in their homes or elsewhere, and there would be&quot; justifiable grounds for Icomplaint if they were incarcerated. It may be noted here that Gopi Nath Shaha and Premananda Datta were both known to be minor members of the conspiracy long before they committed the murders of Mr. Day and Sub-Inspector Prafulla Ray. They would have been dealt with if the Government of Bengal had had power to intern, and two lives would in all probability have been saved. There are a number of persons of this class whose names are known, any one of whom may at any time commit another murder. In the second place, before an application can be made for action under the Regulation, it is necessary to make out a complete case in order to satisfy the Local Government and the Government of India of the necessity of such action. Under the Defence of India Act arrests might be made on reasonable suspicion and the enquiry had not to be completed for two or three weeks. The case against a particular individual might and. frequently did rest upon information which would have been inadequate for immediate action under Regulation III, but when action was taken simultaneously against a considerable number of persons, their independent statements provided, a mass of information which threw a flood of light on the persons, who had taken part in the movement and the part which each had played. It may be suggested that action on these lines is fraught with the danger that evidence may be fabricated. This question was, however, very carefully considered by Sir N. G. Chandavarkar and Mr. Justice Beachcroft, in a series of [12055] c 2        .
passages in the memorandum which they wrote in 1918, from among which the following may be quoted:- * - e&quot; If an individual member of the revolutionary organisation is arrested and dealt with by the State, the revolutionary crime does not end; it goes on and where a person arrested confesses the crime, the confession is useful to Government only if it becomes a starting point to the police for fresh investiga-tion of the crime, continuous as it is. Every such confession, so far from exhausting its activity with the arrest and disposal according to law of the&apos; person making it, continues, subject to the sifting process of truth, for a IW period. The temptation, therefore, to which a police officer is exposed of extorting confessions, true or false, in the case of ordinary crime, is very much less in the case of revolutionary crime. The risk which the police run of certain exposure is greater in the latter than in the former.* * * * * *&quot; We applied ourselves at the outset of our enquiry to a careful scrutiny of the most important of the confessions .... In that scrutiny we had this advantage, that we are called upon to examine each of the cases, not as and when it arose, but long after the confessions, which have proved helpful to the police in successfully and step by step coping with revolutionary crime, had sufficient time in some cases, years, in some cases, months to undergo the sifting process of truth and prove themselves by the discoveries made, absconders traced and arrested, hidden revolutionary haunts, arms and ^ ammunition and other materials of revolutionary crime found in consequence of &apos; information and clues given in the confessions. We are satisfied that the police have taken care to see that the confessions they have obtained are true and have been helpful. We have come across cases which show that sometimes the police have been overcautious in that respect.&quot;Further, it was often possible to persuade the persons who had been arrested of the futility of violent revolution, and to release them, but it is much more difficult to do this if they are in jail.And lastly, a great defect in the use of the Regulation, worked as above, is that it does not destroy the conspiracy. Leaders may be dealt with one by one, but there are others ready to take their place at once, and the organisation goes on, not weakened, but being built up day by day as more recruits are drafted in.12. The situation as it stands to-day is then this that there is an efficient organisation, backed up and led by leaders, prominent members of the Swaraj party, furnished with funds from the coffers of that party, which not only sympathises with, but encourages, revolutionary activity, and has practically made violence one of its planks. That organisation is increasing in numbers day by day, bombs are being manufactured on a large scale, and ample preparations are being made for the assassination of officers. It is difficult to deal with its members in the absence of overt acts; even when they occur, it is becoming practically impossible to get witnesses to depose, and the probability of securing a conviction in a case tried by a jury is extremely slight such is the effect of the terrorism which the revolutionaries apply. And although the knowledge in the possession of Government of the various activities of the party is considerable, it is impossible to take action on any effective scale without revealing thereby the sources of information and running the almost certain risk of losing these sources and the cutting off of all information. Feeling is running high among the European community in particular, which has been greatly excited by the Sirajganj resolution, and should anything happen to Mr. Tegart, an outburst of racial feeling and possible reprisals would create a situation full of alarming possibilities. At the moment a feeling of nervousness amongst the revolutionaries, engendered by their success with the Gopi Nath -resolution, has been responsible for a temporary lull in their activities, although this has in no measure stood in the way of developing the organisation. But the situation is extremely serious, and our latest information points to renewed activity at no distant date. For a time Government were able to keep pace with the movement, but it has for some time now got beyond their control, and it is now impossible to cope with it with the existing powers. The time will come sooner or later when drastic action must be taken and that without delay or hesitation-to prevent the conspiracy from being a grave danger to the country. An epidemic of assassinations would remove the most valuable officers ot the force, would affect the morale of the police, would hearten the revolutionaries,
and generally produce a situation which His Excellency in Council dare not contemplate. His Excellency &quot;in Council is convinced that he cannot exercise his responsibilities in the matter unless he has power adequately to deal with this movement. The Governor in Council is convinced, from the experience gamed in Bengal during the former revolutionary movement, that nothing less than measures on the lines of the Defence of India Rules will enable him to check the movement, and that, until he is given these powers, the movement will continue to spread and the danger be increased. He desires, therefore, to introduce legislation on these lines, and I am to enclose a draft Bill (Enclosure No. 3) for the previous sanction of the Governor-General under section 80 A (3) of the Government of India Act. The Governor in Council recogises that the Legislative Council are not likely to pass any legislation of this kind, and that it will be necessary to proceed under section 72 E of the Government of India Act. Before an Act so passed become operative, it must be laid before each House of Parliament and must receive the assent of His Majesty in Council. It would be worse than useless to attempt to introduce the Bill in Council at all if it were to be disallowed at later stage, and I am, therefore, to request that, if the Government of India are prepared to sanction this proposal to legislate, the views of the Secretary of State for India in Council may be obtained before final orders are passed.13. I am further to ask that, if legislation on the lines proposed is agreed to, the Governor-General may be pleased to issue an Ordinance identical in its terms with the Bill, as soon as this Government request him to do so. The Governor in Council will immediately thereafter introduce the Bill into the Bengal Legislative Council. In the opinion of the Governor in Council the proposed legislation will lose its effect if he is unable to act without warning to the revolutionaries, and, in the absence of an Ordinance, the interval between the introduction of the Bill and its becoming law will give them this warning.14. Einally, I am to emphasise the extreme importance from the point of view of the Government of Bengal of keeping this letter and its enclosures absolutely secret; first, because if the information contained, in them were divulged, it would lead to the exposure of the sources of information, with the results that information would for some time inevitably cease to be available and that those who had given it would, in all probability, be murdered, and second, because it is of the utmost importance that the revolutionaries should have no warning whatever of these proposals.I have, &amp;c.A.

Enclosure 4 in above. Brief for use in Council or Parliament.Existence of a Revolutionary Conspiracy.1. Without danger to the sources from which our information is derived we cannot disclose all we know about the existence of the revolutionary organisation and its activities, but there is a good deal of material which we can place before the public, both of a specific and general nature which, if considered in the light of the revolutionary campaign of 1914-17 and the conclusions arrived at by those who went fully into the details of that campaign and the activities of the revolutionary during that period, which show clearly that a similar state of affairs, exists at the present time and establish the necessity for measures to deal with this conspiracy on lines akin to those which alone proved effective in crushing the previous campaign.2. It will not be denied that a revolutionary conspiracy existed during the years 1914-17 which established a reign of terror throughout Bengal. It is indeed admitted by the revolutionaries themselves in the books that they have written and in articles in the public Press. Every possible method of dealing with this con-spiraey was tried without avail, but it was not until the leaders were imprisoned under the provisions of Regulation III of 1818 and the rank and file were interned under the Defence of India Act that the forces of law and order gained the upper hand and the movement was finally crushed. Subsequently, after the Royal Pro-clamation of 1919, all persons interned under the Defence of India Act were released. Many of these forsook their revolutionary ways and have not returned to them. When the Reforms were instituted there was still under restraint a comparatively small group of irreconcilables who were the leaders of the movement. To these the amnesty was gradually extended in the hope that the new era under the Reforms would effect a change in their attitude towards Government. These hopes have not, however, been realised. The revolutionary leaders were not satisfied with the reforms, they still believed that by violence, alone swaraj could be attained, and it was not long before they were known to be back on the oid lines, reorganising their old societies as before, but taking good care to avoid the mistakes which they thought had been responsible for their previous defeat. To this end they were assisted by the non-co-operation movement. The revolutionaries who had constantly preached violence as the only road to freedom, had naturally no faith in non-violent non-co-operation. . They realised, however, that this non-violent policy had been accepted by the extreme politicians generally and they had perforce to stand by and watch developments in the political arena during the years 1920 and 1921. During this period&apos;, although no overt acts occurred, the revolutionaries were not idle. They seized on the opportunity afforded them by the non-co-operation movement as a cloak to cover their operations. They reunited their followers and perfected their organisa-tion with a view to future action when opportunity offered.3. Following on the Bardoli resolutions of 1922 and the events arising therefrom, it soon became clear to us that the proportion of the extremist party which had no faith in the non-violent cult was steadily increasing. The revolutionaries in Bengal formed a nucleus of this section, and during 1922 several attempts were made by the irreconcilable element to commit the Bengal Congress Committee to a definitely violent programme. They finally became convinced by the end of 1922 that they must depend on themselves alone, and they decided to organise at once for a campaign of violence. Since then revolutionary activity has markedly increased; the old organisation, resuscitated, is at work under the same leaders and following the same methods as in 1914-17.There were two main organisations in the past; both are in existence to-day. The attack on Government has been definitely organised on Sinn Fein lines local administration is to be captured and controlled by revolutionary organisations throughout the province -and Government officials terrorised by a campaign of assassination.In pursuance of this policy the leaders bestirred themselves in the recruitment of new members and the collection of arms. Asrams were organised on lines similar to those which played so important a part as recruiting-centres in the former revolutionary warfare. We know that leading members of the two organisations have been very active in propaganda- work and in endeavouring to secure recruits, particularly from-the student class. And even the movement at Tarakeswar is being [12055] , d 2
utilised as a means of drawing youths into the revolutionary net. We know that the revolutionaries have manufactured a new and highly dangerous type of bomb and that they have secured a considerable number of arms and a large stock of ammunition, partly of a kind which cannot be obtained in India and must have been smuggled from abroad. These weapons have been used in some of the outrages that have occurred in the past.year, and it is significant that the ammunition used was of the same foreign make unprocurable lawfully in this country.4. Such&apos;are the more general facts relating to the revolutionary organisation which we can disclose. But it is possible to indicate certain details of the activities that they have displayed. We know that since 1921 the revolutionary party have been meditating the assassination of certain police officers, including, since his return to India, Mr. Tegart, and our information has been corroborated by the fact that revolutionaries were. actually watching the movements of these officers and their residences. These watchers were themselves placed under observation and&apos;traced to places which are known to be revolutionary haunts. About a couple of months ago three youths reconnoitred a building occupied by some police officers in circumstances which pointed strongly to an attempt to bomb that building. The contre-espionage, which was adopted as a result of this watching of police officers, confirmed in considerable measure our previous knowledge. Apart from the assassination of police officers and their agents, the outrages committed by the revolutionary party in 1914-17 included the commission of a large number of dacoities. These crimes were committed mainly to provide the revolutionists with funds for carrying on their operations. The present body of revolutionaries embarked on a similar campaign last year. In May there was a dacoity with double murder at Kona, near Howrah; in the same month the Ultadingi post office was looted. We have full details of these outrages in the statement made to a Magistrate by one of those who actually participated in them. We know that the same type and pattern of arms, ammunition and paraphernalia was used in both these dacoities. A robbery with murder took place at Garpar Road on the 30th July, in which firearms were again used, and our information again showed that this was the work of the same gang. Next followed the Sankaritola murder, in which the postmaster was shot. One of the assailants was arrested redhanded with a pistol of foreign make of the type to which reference has already been made, and in the dispensary at which this assailant said he was employed, two more revolvers were discovered. It was known previous to this that this particular assailant was a member of one of the revolutionary parties, and raids were then made on the haunts which they generally occupied, and several arrests were made. Statements made by some of those arrested fully corroborated and amplified information already in. our possession, and proved conclusively that these outrages were all the work of this particular group of the revolutionary party. Seven members of the gang were put on trial in the Alipore conspiracy case. This trial ended in an acquittal as a result of the verdict of the jury. A great deal of the facts in possession of the police could not be put before the Court, while the Judge, in accepting the verdict of the jury, expressed the hope that the case would prove a lesson to the accused. Subsequently certain of the accused who had not admitted their guilt previously, practically admitted, their complicity in these outrages, and also admitted that the main object of the conspiracy was the assassination of police officers. Three of the accused were dealt with under Regulation III on the ground that they were known to be conspiring against police officers a conspiracy which was continued even while they were incarcerated as under-trial prisoners in jail..5.. The situation at the time when these outrages were committed was becoming menacing. The revolutionaries had come into the open with dacoities and murders -intended, partly to terrorise, partly to &quot; blood &quot;. their men, and partly to obtain funds and with&apos; the definite intention of a campaign of assassination against police officers. Public opinion had been shocked, the lives of our officers were in imminent danger, and it became clear that unless immediate action was taken, terrorism and crime would spread and Bengal would be again exposed to the dangers and miseries of the previous outbreak of revolutionary crime. Swift and immediate action was imperative, and, as a result, Regulation III of 1818 was put into operation and certain, leaders were incarcerated. This action checked the movement for the time being. . The organisation was not prepared for the attack. This situation unhappily did not last long. New leaders were found and operations were resumed. In December last, four.revolutionaries armed with revolvers committed at Chittagong a robbery of 17,000 rupees, the property of the Assam-Bengal Railway, and this was followed ten days later by a running fight between the gang and a party of
police and villagers, in the course of which two men were arrested with firearms in their possession. In a house which had been occupied by this gang were found a number of weapons and ammunition, which included four cartridges of the foreign type mentioned above. An attempt was made to decoy from his house one of the chief witnesses in the robbery case (at present sub judice) in circumstances which leave little doubt that an outrage was intended, and the evening following that incident a Sub-Inspector named Prafulla Ray was shot at Chittagong. This Sub-Inspector had arrested one of the gang who is still under trial in the robbery-case, and was known to have taken a prominent part in the investigations in Calcutta.6. Next we have the events in Calcutta in which Mr. Day was murdered in January by Gopi Nath Saha in mistake for Mr. Tegart, Commissioner of Police, and the attempt in April to shoot Mr. Bruce in Harrison Road-in circumstances which suggest that this was also a similar case of mistaken identity. It may be noted here that the ammunition used in the murder of Mr. Day and Sub-Inspector Prafulla Ray was also of the type to which a reference has already been made. In March last there was the discovery of a bomb factory in Calcutta, in connection with which two members of the revolutionary party have been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The bombs used marked a distinct advance on anything which the revolutionaries have hitherto produced, being modelled on the Mills bomb and loaded with ammonium picrate. As the result of the find of bombs in Calcutta, search was made in the house of an associate of the individual in whose possession the bombs were found. This resulted in the discovery of one of the Mauser pistols stolen from Messrs. Rodda and Co. in 1914, and also a revolver and a certain quantity of ammunition. This conspirator was also convicted and sentenced. Almost simultaneously a member of the Pabna section was severely injured while making a - bomb at Faridpur. Since the end of May. there have been no overt acts, but this does not mean that the revolutionaries have been inactive. Apart from the crimes mentioned wre know that others were planned, and the assassination of police officers is still contemplated. We know that the conspiracy to assassinate Mr. Tegart and other police officers is still being vigorously pursued. We know that recruitment to the ranks of the revolutionary party is proceeding apace, and that to-day a strong organisation exists throughout the province. -7. Before proceeding to the causes which have led to a temporary lull in the overt activities, a brief reference may be made to the campaign in the Press and on public platforms, which has proved so effective an agency in assisting the party to perfect their organisation and increase their numbers. This campaign started in 1922 and grew in intensity till the months of June and July 1923. The eulogy of old revolu-tionaries, the idealising of youths who committed murders and other crimes and the publishing of their biographies were all resorted to with the obvious intention of inciting.the youth of Bengal to follow the example of these heroes. Articles still appear daily in the Indian press inciting racial hatred and verging as near to violence as the freedom of the press admits.8. It will be apparent from the foregoing that the situation at the end of May was fraught with dangerous possibilities. In the beginning of June an event occurred which has undoubtedly given the situation a far more serious aspect. A meeting of the Bengal Provincial Conference was held at Siraj gang in the Pabna district. This meeting was attended by Mr. C. R. Das, the leader of the Swaraj party, not only in Bengal, but throughout India. He was supported by the leading members of the Swaraj party of this Province. The meeting was also attended by several hundreds of members and. followers of the revolutionary party. During the course of the proceedings of this conference, certain resolutions were passed. These mcluded a resolution which expressed admiration for the spirit of self-sacrifice exhibited by Gopi Nath Saha. This resolution was carried to all intents and purposes unanimously in an open conference attended by about 6,000 persons, who included representatives from every district in Bengal. The dissentients were a mere handful. A considerable amount of discussion has taken place since regarding the actual words m which the resolution was framed and passed, but there can be no question as to the. meaning of the resolution to the ordinary man in the street, namely, that assassination as a political weapon had the approval of the Swaraj leaders and the Swaraj party in this Province. The effect on the revolutionary party was electrical. They were assured, in public and in no uncertain language, of the support of the Swaraj party in their campaign of violence. It is clear that this resolution has proved itself to be by far the most potent recruiting instrument which has ever been
placed in the hands of the revolutionary organisers.. Since June this resolution has been constantly before the public eye as a continual incitement to the youth of Bengal to take to violent ways and there can be no doubt that the resolution was passed with this end in view. It is common knowledge now that this resolution was the result of an agreement between the revolutionaries and the Swaraj party. The revolutionaries gave their support to the resolution regarding the Hindu-Muhammadan pact in return for the passing of this resolution which accorded its approval of violence. It is significant that this resolution has since June been twice reaffirmed by Mr. C. R. Das in most explicit terms. The connection between the revolutionaries and the Swaraj ists can thus be well understood it is reasonable to conclude that the aims of both are one and the same on the question of violence. This connection between the two parties if they are really two parties may afford some explanation of the lull in overt acts since June last. As has been said, one of the objects of dacoities by the revolutionary party was to secure funds for their activities. The revolutionaries appear at the moment to be in possession of ample funds, and therefore may not be forced to have recourse to crime for this purpose. Whence have they got their funds ? In the light of the agreement with the Swaraj party, which we know has ample funds at its disposal, and the Sirajgang resolution, it would seem fairly obvious what the source is which provides finance for the revolutionary party. It is the possession of the wherewithal to carry on their operations that accounts in part for the discontinuance, temporary at any rate, of these dacoities with murder, but it must not be concluded therefrom that the revolutionary party has abandoned its main plan of assassination or that the danger no longer exists.There are other reasons which have tended to bring about this seeming inactivity. Police action, contre-espionage, and the arrest from time to time of certain leaders, have all contributed to retard or check the assassination plots. Further, the public feeling engendered by the Sirajgang resolution has undoubtedly acted as a danger signal. But the lull is merely on the surface. The consolidation&apos; and equipment of the party and recruitment all are going on vigorously with a view to launching a revolutionary campaign of assassination when the moment seems opportune.9. We&apos; have thus at the moment in Bengal a large revolutionary party, working under two main organisations, secretly organising and equipping itself for a campaign of assassination against the officers of Government with a view to the overthrow of Government by force and violence; its existence is beyond doubt, its organisation is getting stronger day by day, and if Bengal is not to undergo the danger and miseries which resulted from the conspiracy of 7 to 10 years ago, it must be crushed without delay. As a general consideration stress could be laid on the necessity of protecting the youth of Bengal, in their own interest as well as that of the general public, from the clutches of revolutionary organisers. It is significant that Baren Ghosh, who was sentenced to death for the murder of the postmaster in Sankaritola, Gopi Saha, who was executed for the murder of Mr. Day, and Premananda Datta, who is Under trial for the murder of Sub-Inspector Prafulla Ray at Chittagong, were all three known to the police as members of the revolutionary party before their arrest, and had the police been equipped with powers to deal with theni on the lines of the Defence of India Act, action would undoubtedly have been taken against them with a view to segregating them from the evil influence of their leaders, and thereby possibly have averted the three dastardly outrages and protected these youths themselves from the consequences of their crimes.10.. Hitherto these remarks have been confined to the indigenous organisations, but the evil does not end here. We find, as in the previous campaign, that the local revolutionaries have received and are expecting more help from revolutionary organisations abroad. Of these the most important is the Bolshevik caucus m Europe,, at the,head of which stands Narendra Nath Bhattacharji,. a resident of the 24-Parganas district, who is more generally known by his alias of Manabendra Nath Roy. This Indian renegade, who has for several years past been in close touch with the Comintern, has, we know, been provided with considerable funds by the latter with the object of stirring up trouble in India on Bolshevik lines. He has at various times in the last three years sent emissaries to this country. These included a well-known English Bolshevik named Charles Ashley, who was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment for fomenting revolutionary conspiracies in the United States. He was released before serving his sentence, joined Roy in Berlin, and was sent out to India, where he got in touch in Bombay with Dange, who was recently convicted in the Bolshevik conspiracy case at Cawnpur. Ashley was detected at Bombay and
shipped home by the next week&apos;s mail steamer, but not before he had fulfilled an important part of his mission. More recently still we have the case of Nalini Gupta, an active member of the Bengal revolutionary party in the previous outbreak. This man was arrested in Calcutta in December 1923, and was finally convicted and sentenced in the Cawnpur case, mentioned above. Nalini did not deny, when examined by the police, that he was an emissary sent to India by M. N. Roy in order to get in touch, inter alia, with revolutionary leaders in Bengal. We further know that Roy was in correspondence with Jadu Gopal Mukharji, Atul Ghosh, Satish Chakrabarti and Jiban Lai Chatarji, all four of whom are now incarcerated under Regulation III of 1818 as leaders of one section of the revolutionary party. Roy&apos;s modus operandi included the furnishing of arms and money to the revolu-tionary party in Bengal. Apart from the Bolshevik connection, the Bengal revolutionaries are known to be in touch with Indian renegades in other parts of the world who have never ceased to conspire with the object of subverting, the Government in India by violent methods.11. As to the measures to be taken to crush this conspiracy, we have the experience of the past to guide us. The conspiracy of to-day has the same aims, the same methods more perfected, so as to avoid the mistakes of the&apos;past and largely also the same leaders as the conspiracy of 1914-17. All efforts to crush the old conspiracy failed until the Defence of India Act and Rules came into operation, and only then was it found possible effectively to deal with it. Differences of opinion existed at the outset as to the best method to deal with the conspiracy, but the eventual conclusion, in which all concurred, was that it is impossible to fight a revolutionary conspiracy or deal with revolutionary crime under the ordinary law or through the ordinary machinery of the courts, and that special powers, and those of an extra judicial character, are indispensably necessary. It was equally the unanimous conclusion that powers given under the Defence of India Act and Rules proved successful to this end, and that no other powers have ever been suggested as really effective. The conclusions of the Rowlatt and Lowndes Committees, the report of Messrs. Beachcroft and Chandravarkar, and the remarks of the Committee on Repressive Laws can be quoted in support of this view. The case for the applica-tion of Regulation III to crimes of this kind has been more than once explained to the Legislative Council. It was indeed explained to the Council in January last in dealing with the arrests made in the latter part of last year in connection with this very conspiracy. But at this stage which the conspiracy has now reached, it is not sufficiently effective, and, unless further powers are conferred, it will be impossible to prevent the spread of the movement, which has already reached very dangerous dimensions. In the earliest stages of the organisation, with only a small number of leaders, the use of Regulation III might and did retard the movement, but only for a time. By the arrest of individual members, however, the conspiracy did not come to an end. Now, with a larger organisation and with leaders ready to take the place of those arrested, the Regulation becomes inadequate. It does not operate to kill the conspiracy, when leaders are readily available to fill vacancies, and the organisation, particularly among the rank and file, is being strengthened day by day. The actual would-be assassins are not generally to be found in the ranks of the leaders. If we are, therefore, to crush the conspiracy, the net must be cast much wider; we must deal not only with the leaders, but with those who are ready to succeed as leaders and with potential assassins and recruits. In doing so, it is unnecessary in all cases to take the extreme measure of detention in jail. In many cases our end would be adequately met by using the power of internment rather than by detention in jail. This is the procedure which we should apply to the minor members of the conspiracy, any one of whom, it may be noted, may at any time commit murder, if he is left in touch with the leaders of the movement.12. The Bill makes provision for this and follows on the lines of the Defence of India Act and Rules, the provisions of which alone have been shown to be the only effective method of dealing with a conspiracy of this kind.The Bill further provides for a special means of trial of persons accused of revolutionary crime. This, again, follows on the results of past experience the ordinary machinery of the courts is inadequate to deal with cases of this kind. Terrorism of witnesses and juries, failure of juries, largely through fear, to return verdicts in accordance with the evidence,, the murder of witnesses and persons who have confessed or turned King&apos;s evidence, the fear of witnesses to depose correctly, all combine to render justice unobtainable. This has already been shown by the results of the Alipore conspiracy case and the case at Chittagong, and the evidence1
given by-a witness in the case against Premananda Datta in the Chittagong murder case: : - if-      &apos;4--Vi       :;r i-..., tliu^y; yieii .go; fn-: ,;ai ... .Much might be said on the subject of the Alipore conspiracy case. e.g., the relatives of the approver, Nritya Gopal Datta, were subjected in Calcutta to various forms of harassment. During the course of the trial, Nritya&apos;s brother died. Owinc to social ostracism, the family were unable to get people to carry the dead body to the burning ghat. Further, Nritya GopaFs sister, who was engaged to be married, was thrown over by the prospective bridegroom as soon as the latter&apos;s relatives heard that her brother was an approver in this case. The approver himself was cross-examined for weeks on end by five different counsel for the defence in circumstances which practically drove him to the verge of insanity. He was unable to sleep in the jail and was suffering towards the close of the trial from nightmare and hallucina-tions. As regards the verdict of the jury, the following remark made by the foreman in returning the verdict is worthy of note: &quot;Whether we have been able to find out the truth in this trial is known only to that great -Omniscient unerring Judge before whom we have been on our trial as.it were during the last three months.&quot;In the Chittagong case, following the verdict of acquittal in the original charge in connection with &apos;the running fight, referred to above, the Crown were compelled to move the High Court for a transfer of the second charge, namely, the actual robbery, on the grounds that a fair trial could not be expected at Chittagong. In &apos;the case against Premananda Datta, the principal witness entirely resiled in court from the statement which he made before the police. Afterwards he fell at the feet of the investigating officer and begged his pardon, saying that he was compelled to perjure himself in order to save his life. In this case also the Crown have been compelled to move the High Court for a transfer from Chittagong.Enclosure 5 in above. Bande Mataram.

Bengal Government report, as result of the outrage, their main source of information regarding the inner working of the Jugantur group is no longer available. They recently obtained from this source report of the inception of plot directed against life of his Excellency the Governor. Their intelligence, is now seriously crippled, and grave developments may take place at any moment without previous indication. Source of information mentioned was in close touch with the Swaraj revolutionary leaders, and it was for this reason that action against these leaders under Regulation o, though otherwise regarded as extremely necessary, was not recommended by the Government of Bengal.
Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Home Department, dated .  &apos; 30th August, 1924.2458. Your telegram of the 28th August; Bomb outrage. On assumption that Government of India will satisfy themselves as to strength of evidence in each case, I do not desire to interfere with your discretion.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, dated 2nd September, 1924.2992-D. Bengal revolutionaries. Reference to correspondence ending with your telegram 2458 of the 30th August. We are. satisfied that the information received establishes the fact that the eighteen persons mentioned in our telegram of the 27th ultimo, 2397-D, are all active and dangerous revolutionaries. We have strongly impressed on the Bengal Government the gravity of the implications entailed generally by the action they urge,Nand especially by the arrest of certain of the persons implicated; but if, after weighing fully all these considerations, they still hold that the action they propose is imperatively necessary and cannot be postponed, we have authorised them to execute the warrants which, in order to obviate inconvenient emergent action being necessary, had already been issued subject to confirmation which we have now given.In a subsequent telegram of the 2nd September the Bengal Government report that the situation has seriously deteriorated and is now one of extreme gravity. The Governor in Council considers that the issue of the warrant under Regulation 3 must be followed immediately by the Ordinance. We await their letter, which will presumably explain the situation fully and which has been despatched from Calcutta to-day.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, dated 5th.September, 1924.3017-D. Continuation of our telegram No. 2992-D, dated 2nd September. Following telegram 1365 P.D., dated 3rd September, received from Bengal: &quot; Your telegram of the 2nd September, 2992, Political. We have addressed you fully in our letter No. 1360, dated 3rd September, which should reach you on Saturday morning, and this letter, we think, contains sufficient answer to your observations as to the wisdom of taking action against prominent leaders of the revolutionary section of the Swaraj party. In our opinion, and we entertain no doubt on this point, time has come when it is imperative to strike, and to do so effectively, at the revolutionary movement in all. its branches. Our action will be, of course, misrepresented, but, in our opinion, it would be folly to cripple the effectiveness of the measure in the vain hope of avoiding criticism. Moment has arrived when, in our opinion, only consideration should be necessity of any step to achieve the object in view. We are satisfied that the evidence we can lay before the judge(s) in the cases of all these men will be no less conclusive than that which we have submitted in other cases. WTe would draw your attention to the statement made by C. R. Das in interview with the &apos; Statesman&apos; newspaper.. We regard this as most opportune, and feel that it will greatly strengthen our hands. Please see also Tegart&apos;s letter 1st September to D.I.B. on this subject. Finally, we are convinced that, as soon as the Government has shown that it has effective weapons and the courage to use them, opinion, which is now afraid of both revolutionists and Swarajists, will rally to the support of the Government. In our despatch referred to at the beginning of this telegram&apos;we have intimated that we are prepared to postpone these arrests if possible, until we have received the orders of the Government of India with regard to promulgating ordinance.&quot;[12055]e    -12. Bengal Government now urge the necessity of the immediate arrest, under the Regulation, of 18 persons; these include Subash Chandra Bose, Chief Executive Officer of Calcutta Municipality and one of chief lieutenants of C. R. Das, two members of the Legislative Council, and other prominent revolutionary leaders. Matter is under our consideration and we have called for further information. We should be glad to receive any observations you may have to offer with the least possible delay by telegram.
Mr. C. R. Das\i Statement as reported in the &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; dated ; . 2nd September, 1024.Asked to outline the immediate programme, Mr. 0. R. Das gave me a carefully-pondered statement: &quot; I hope mass civil disobedience will be unnecessary. I started with the idea of destroying the reforms, believing them to be a sham. I claim I have succeeded. The next step for my party is to educate, first, the electorate, and then the masses so that the whole of India may formulate a consistent demand the undeniable right of early self-government. After that it will be my duty to convey to the authorities in England the truth about. India. That truth is easily stated : unless real self-government is granted in a short time the peaceful work on which Swarajists are now engaged will become impossible. I have been a truer friend of constitutional progress and more against the growing tendency towards anarch than the Government will believe.&quot;I asked : &quot; You admit, then, that there is an anarchist movement in Bengal ?&quot; Mr. Das replied :  &quot; Undoubtedly, and a much more serious anarchist movement than the authorities realise. It is growing increasingly difficult to suppress it. I hope Britain and India will get together presently and come to terms on the lines mentioned. If the Swarajist movement fails, no repression can possibly cope with the anarchy which is sure to raise its head, and violence and disorder will reign supreme. The authorities do not realise that with the failure of the Swarajist movement the people will lose all faith in any form of constitutional methods. When that happens, what is left to them but violent anarchical revolutionary methods.&quot;-From Secretary of State to Viceroy, i)th September, 1924.Private and personal. Bengal situation. The Indian Cabinet Committee have been examining your despatch of 9th August and your official and private telegrams since that date. We realise that you have not yet accepted the position that an emergency exists and that you do not yet ask us to assent to the special proposals put forward by the Government of Bengal. It will help us to come to a decision on any request which you may make and which we presume will precede action if you could give us an answer to the following questions :  (1.) Do you adhere to statement at end of your private and personal telegram of 11th August, that in any event you would only recommend action of even limited enactment of Part I of the proposed Bill after the emergency had been established to your satisfaction ?(2.) What are your reasons for wanting enactment of Part I, which appears only to authorise trial by special Commissioners instead of ordinary Courts ?(3.) What exactly are advantages of any new Ordinance over fullest possible use of Regulation III in conjunction with all existing powers under ordinary law freely applied?From Viceroy, 11th September,1924.Private and personal. Your telegram of 9th inst. Bengal situation. Our official telegram of to-day will have conveyed to you our present views based upon Lytt,on&apos;s and Government of Bengali representations.2. In answer to your first and second questions, the suggestion we made previously, limiting action to the enactment of Part I of the proposed Bill, is abandoned by us in consequence of developments in Bengal. It was intended as a step to meet difficulties envisaged of securing conviction of offenders by juries, but we are convinced that by its (? omission) it will now be inadequate to meet situation.
OKI 3 o i telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, dated Sejrteviber 10, 1924.3067 D. Following is summary of letter dated the 1st September from Bengal regarding measures necessary to deal with political situation : &quot;Governor in Council accepts conclusions of Government of India (1) that existence of emergency is for them to determine, and (2) that, on evidence before them on the 15th August, they were nots prepared to hold that emergency had arisen. The object was to indicate that extraordinary powers would most probably be necessary, and to obtain assurance that they would be granted at proper time.&quot; 2. As regards suggestions for action, short of special measures, put forward by Government of India, Governor in Council observes as follows : &quot; First, he will strengthen Intelligence Branch as necessity arises, but results depend more on sources of information than on strength of staff, and danger of exposing sources prevents action on information so long as rank and file of revolu-tionaries cannot be dealt with. He recommends employment of Bamford of Bengal Intelligence Branch under Director of Intelligence Bureau. Secondly, more extensive use of Regulation III of 1818 was prevented by fear of exposing chief source of information regarding Jugantur group. Mirzapur Street outrage has changed position as source referred to must now cease, and risk of exposure need no longer be considered, while no other source available and further delay dangerous. Governor in Council has therefore asked for warrants against twenty leaders;. Places of leaders will, however, be filled, and rank and file ready to assassinate will not be affected. Thirdly, con-sidered opinion of Governor in Council is that eventually Part One of Bill could not be passed without action under Section 72E, Government of India Act, and that, while Part One alone would be useful, Part Two is required to break up conspiracy.&quot; 3. Recent march of events has been rapid, and Governor in Council now presses for immediate grant of extraordinary powers on the following grounds : &quot;(1.) Marked development of assassination plots. Das endeavoured to postpone definite action, though he made no effort to discontinue assassination until Swaraj party had gained supremacy in Legislative Council. In spite of this, recent overt acts such as issue of &quot; Red Bengal&quot; leaflets and Mirzapur Street outrage have taken place, and whole series of assassinations have been planned. Jugantur party no longer restrained by him, and Anushilan never were so.&quot;(2.) Excitement of campaign against Ministers being ended, revolutionaries likely to turn to the assassinations already planned. [12055] v; i03. I regard main advantages of Ordinance and legislation over Regulation III to be (a.) The search for bombs and arms which is now unauthorised under the law. (b.) The segregation of those who harbour and assist in the furtherance ofconspiracy and cannot be reached by Regulation III. (c.) The power to deal without delay and by special tribunal with offendersagainst the Ordinance and legislations, (d.) Preventive action in the power to arrest without warrant.I attribute special importance to the right to search for bombs and arms. In the manufacture of bombs and accumulation of arms lies the most serious danger. Neither Regulation III nor ordinary law is available for above purposes.4. The arrest under Regulation III of 20 persons, including prominent persons mentioned, will, of course, produce great outcry. The Ordinance and proposed legislation if introduced at same time will probably not greatly intensify the situation, and it seems better policy to take action simultaneously by all the measures we deem necessary to meet the exceptional conditions.5. I have impressed upon Lytton necessity for summoning his Legislative Council immediately he has begun to take action under the Ordinance and for presenting the proposed Bill to them. He has advantage of Das&apos;s recent warning statement regarding the gravity of revolutionary situation in Bengal. Probably Lytton intends to take above course as it was his Governments original proposal but it is desirable to arrive at clearly defined conclusions upon it before action is taken.
&quot; (3,) There is serious danger of large consignments of arms reaching the revolutionaries. Information suggests consignment seized in Colombo intended for Bengal, and others going to Far East are awaited by persons intouch with&apos;the revolutionaries.&apos; 1 Only- effective method of scotching &quot;this danger&apos; iV:to strike at&apos; rivolufionanes and cut off &quot;supplies. Delivery of even one consignment would&apos;&apos;&apos;c&apos;reate situation beyond &quot;the powers of Government, ahd&quot;&apos;i&apos;t&apos; is&quot; essential that&apos; Government &quot;should strike before revolutionaries do so. Outburst of violence in Bengal&apos;would be accom-panied by outbreaks elsewhere. Plans&apos;to this end are &apos;known to be prepared.&apos; (4.) Two&quot;&apos; Bolshevik Agents have recently been in touch with revolutionary leaders, and have &quot;promised&apos; funds from&apos; Comintern,&apos; and&apos; suggested routes and methods for importation of arms!&apos;sun iMA       C&apos;iv it ,Tt?%nvr &apos;     c l ,&quot; 4. Further considerations which influence Governor in Council are as follows: first, situation &quot;in. Bengal has greatly; deteriorated in the past year, revolutionary organisation&apos; improved,&apos; recruits more numerous, &quot;and anti-Government feeling more bitter. Arrest of leaders may lead to reprisals&apos; by the rank and file, and Governor in Council must be in apposition to &quot;deal with &quot;such situation &quot;without any&apos;delay. Action against both leaders and rank and file will &quot;forestall action by latter and inspire public confidence. Powers must be sufficient to&quot; obviate any chance of failure. Secondly, promulgation of Ordinance will not&apos;increase public outcry against arrests under Regulation III, while enabling Government to deal effectively with the situation. To await the effect of arrests may leave Government helpless in face of &apos; dangerous situation, and involve loss of valuable officers. Thirdly, Government can now command no support. Strong sustained action and evidence of determination to end revolutionary teaching affords best hope of rallying stable elements in Indian society.&quot; 5. Governor in Council therefore urges promulgation of Ordinance immediately after arrests, and, in spite of urgency and danger of situation, will postpone arrests, if possible, pending orders as to Ordinance.&quot;6. Views of the Government of India follow in separate telegram.Telegram from Viceroy, Rome Department, dated 10th September, 1924.3068-D. Following is in continuation of our telegram of the IQth instant, 3067-D.   We have addressed the Governor of Bengal as follows : &quot; Reference your Secret Letter No. 1360-PD, dated 1st September. Government of India are not clear as to the intention of the Governor of Bengal as regards legislation in the Bengal Legislative Council. In the event of the: promulgation of Ordinance, notwithstanding the fact that the Council is not likely to pass legislation and that certification would then be necessary, they consider that it would be highly inadvisable to disregard the Local Legislature. Recent adverse voting of the Legislative Council supplies, in their judgment, reason in favour of, rather than opposed to, the advisability of giving the&apos; Legislature opportunity of at least discussing issue of a fundamentally different character. The operation of an Ordinance being limited; to six months, it appears indispensable that the powers conferred should be continued by legislation. The Governor of Bengal will also realise the grave embarrassment that would be entailed if an Ordinance were made during the sitting of the Central Legislature, unless it were simultaneously announced that its provisions would be submitted, with as little delay as possible, to the normal procedure of legislation. Government of India would be glad to receive the views of the Bengal Government on these considerations by telegram.&quot;2. Qur decision as regards the moment when it will be necessary to act must depend &quot;on the reply of the &quot;Governor of Bengal, but, on consideration of the grave situation reported by them,- we have&apos;come to conclusion that it may at any moment be necessary for&apos; the Governor-General to make and&apos; promulgate an Ordinance in the terms of the draft&apos;communicated to you with our Secretary&apos;^ letter&apos;No. 152 dated 12tfi &quot;August,&quot; subject to a provision to exclude the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the High Court, and to certain drafting amendments. The Ordinance reproduces m substance, with some improvements in form, &quot;arrangement and drafting, operative
provisions of the Governor of Bengal&apos;s draft Bill transmitted to you with our despatch No. 2, Political, dated 9th August. Our desire is to make the situation clear to you, and to ask for your approval to our policy. -3. In view of the gravity of the situation, which has been clearly established, we are confident that we can count upon the support of your Lordship and of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the course which we propose to take.Telegram, from Viceroy, Home Department, dated 10th September, 1924.3090 D. Continuation of our telegram of the 10th September, D. 3067. Following telegram has been received from Bengal: &quot; Further information regarding revolutionary activity.
