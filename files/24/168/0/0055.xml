THIS DOCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY OF HIS -BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRETCABINET. UNEMPLOYMENT POSITION. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.:I circulate for the information of my colleagues the following notes on the recent increases in the-unemployment... figures which not unnaturally have given rise to some anxiety.Since the beginning of June there has been an increase of over 160,000 in the total, but during the last two weeks the increase has been checked.   The increase is mainly in coal-mining, building and ironpuddllng, these three accounting for one half of the total increase,   I have arranged to held a meeting of the Unemployment Sub-Gommittee of the Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 30th inst., to review the steps that are being taken by way of assistance to schemes for the relief of unemployment.The following Table gives the Live Register figures at the beginning cf each month up to September, 1S24, (and for the 2nd and 3rd week of September), with comparative figures for 19231923.I.Increase (+J! or / \.

In 1924, the lowest figure was on June 2nd (1,002,915). After an increase up to 1,052,641 on June loth, largely attributable to Whitsuntide stoppages, the figure fell again to 1,009,444 on June 30th.    From that date onward there was .a continuous and substantial increase until September 8th when the increase almost ceased.An inorease of unemployment from the end of June onwards in not unusual.     In fact, it was a common experience in pre-war years, as shewn by Trade Union percentages for 1900-1914.In 1923, the lowest point in unemployment was reached on May 14th (1,200,291).An industrial analysis of the 1924 figures at the end of the last four months gives the following results for the twelve largest industries :-GR3AI BRITAIN.Industry (in order ofy&amp;agnitude aooord-ing to Ho. insured).tploy-ed at end of May* 1924.Inorease i+j or Peoroase (-) as compared with end of May at and of -June.July,  i August.Percentage sf unecpJ oyment at end of August.il Mining (It stributive rades       (l, Llding ginesring tton &quot;Hen &amp; reted     ( tol, Boarding ouae etc. f i?building( oal 3overn-ent-nting idling urnaoes    ( torehioleg &amp;0j(266.72C)242, 360) 704, 350 ) 663,540) 675,060)27 2, 140)252,350) j 248,090) j242, 330 ) I 227,540) ;214,350) jj193,080) j.38,05278, 501 56, 447 95,790 90,15212,63727,695 35,00114,529 11,94435,89213,581+2L576 i * 48, 210 : t-59,099- 3,462- 208- 4,114- 2,835* 3,108- 3,492- 1,322- 427444* 4,037- Illi - 4, 329 I i 111,705 ! j - 7,758 i *     873 !+ 354 +18,609- 3,202- 2,248* 6,352 j 4- 7,775- 4,043 I- 3, 207 Iit    701!- 843 !i* 6,198 j* 2,388 1- 2,180 * 1,4574 2,767 484+13, 519-f 5,0997.76.3 10.7 14.0 15.37.51C.1 27.27.2 5.023.110.2
o 7*)On the whole there wea a greater percentage increase of unemployment as between August and June among men (13.7 per cent, inoreuse) than among women (8.4 per oent. increase). \She increases in August, 1924, were general all over the country but were most marked in the north of England, Scotland, the Midlands and Jales and least marked in London and the South ox England,iunong large towns the following are the largest proportionate increases as compared with the end of May:-............

It may De relevant to observe that in the United states employment has rapidly declined since February, as will be seen from the following index-numbers of employment have considersi whether or to what extent the recent inoreases in the unemployment figures may have been affeoted by the inoreaae in rates of benefit and other alterations in the soheme of unemployment benefit made by the Act passed at the end of July.Out of a total increase (as between the beginning of June and the beginning of September) of rather more than 160,000, 45,000 ooourred before the beginning of August (the total for the last week in July being 1,048,300), and none of this oan be attributed to the new Aot,Between the beginning of August and tho beginning of September, there was a further ioarease of 115,000, , of whioh some part was due to an effect of the new Aot in inoreasing not the numbers unemployed, but the numbers on the registers and therefore counted as unemployed.    This effect ooourred principally in the following waya:-(a) The alteration in the trade dispute rule under the July Aot brings on the register for the first time all those indirectly affeoted by a trade dispute at the establishment at whioh they were employe! and many of those directly affected;(b) The reduction in the waiting period and other changes in the July Act has a tendency to bringpersons on tho register who would otherwise, .though unemployed, not have thought it worth while to register owing to. tho livelihood that theirunemployment would be of short duration;4.February March Apr il97 96 95May 91 June 88 July  85
S) H actual) i(o)    In some areas the Boards of Guardians have tested the effect of the July Aot by requiring persons drawing relief who had previously been disqualified for benefit to make a fresh claim.   The probability is that not many of them will be suooesaful but in the meantime they owell the registeres.  ! It is not possible -*n present information to say with any certainty what part of the August increase should be attributed to this effect of the new Aot and I am having an investigation made into this point.     It seems unlikely that more than half the   inorease is attributable to this cause.    A considerable part of tho August inorease no doubt refleots a oontlnuanoe of the depression, as is evidenced by the fact that the Trade Union percentages of unemployment also shew a further rise in August as compared with July, following upon similar rises in July and June.In the main, therefore^ it may be said that the increases in the unemployment figures since the end of June reflect a real depression, whioh, however, is largely seasonal and need not fer tho present give rise to any undue alarm.(intd.)
