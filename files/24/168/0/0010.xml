Printed -for the Cabinet.      Jidy 1924...SECRET.CP. 410 (24).CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,21st July 1924.Y7our telegram dated 26th June. Ahmedabad Congress. Of 10 resolutions moved, the following four important, moved by Gandhi, namely : (1) Compulsory spinning tests for the members of the Congress witli penalty clause that, such members as do not send the prescribed quantity Khaddar Board by .15th August will be deemed to have resigned the oflice of the Congress. (2) Disciplinary action, including dismissal, against persons acting in contravention of the instructions issued by the provincial organisations. (3) Five boycotts : foreign cloth, Law Courts,, educational institutions, titles and legislative bodies. (4) Gopinath Shaha resolution. On Gandhi rising to move these resolutions, .Mot: Lai Nehru at once objected on the ground that they were ultra vires of constitution. In this he was supported by Das. After some hot discussion, voting eventually taken resulted in 69 for Aloti Lai Nehru and 83 for Gandhi. Poll subsequently demanded ended in 68 for the former and 83 for Gandhi; 10 remained neutral. Resolution consequently declared perfectly constitutional. Gandhi then proceeded to move the first resolution. Moti Lai again urged the same objection, pointing out that the demand that the Swarajists should go out of the Congress was unreasonable. Thereafter, he, Das and their supporters, numbering about 55, left the hall, when Gandhi&apos;s resolution was put to the vote and passed by 85 to 25, but, on the grounds that penalty clause was carried only by 67 against 37 votes, and that the original resolution would have been defeated had the Swarajists who withdrew been present, it was decided to omit the clause. Majority of the Provinces, except Bengal, were in favour of the original resolution. Swarajists intended leaving Ahmedabad forthwith, but, hearing of deletion of the penalty clause and after compromise effected at private interview with Gandhi, they resolved to attend the further proceedings. On the 29th June, second resolution was passed unanimously. As regards the third, Das pointed out that there was no idea, expressed or intended at Delhi and Coconada, of excluding Swarajists from the Executive after they went to the Council, for which they got the Congress permission. After consideration of some minor amendments, which were defeated, resolution, which / confirmed the compromise reached Coconada, passed by overwhelming majority. In the fourth, Gandhi strongly condemned the acts Gopinath Shaha and all the other political murders as inconsistent with the Congress creed non-violence. Resolution did not command much genuine approval. Many &quot; no-changers &quot; supported Gandhi purely out of loyalty to him. One member from Bengal, whose name cannot be definitely ascertained, said that the entire Province was for violence, but, if Gandhi went there at once, he might be able to check the movement and bring the Bengalis back to the non-co-operation fold. Opposition to the resolution included delegates from Bengal and Berars, Moti Lal&apos;s followers; few from the Punjab, Sindh and Madras. Das moved amendment exact counterpart of his. revised version of the ,Serajgunj resolution. Amendment was defeated by 73 votes to 67, and the original motion carried by overwhelming majority. It was noticed that some &quot; no-changers &quot; voted for Das. As stated in our telegram dated 12th July Sikh situation-resolution of sympathy with the Akali movement also passed.2. Gandhi&apos;s resolution aimed at restoring discipline and the re-establishment of his power. Attempt was complete failure. General impression is that the majority of his followers have ceased to attach great importance to the live boycotts, and Swarajists particularly absolutely refuse to go back on their policy of Council-entry, and regard Khaddar programme impracticable as step towards advancement of Swaraj. Finally, bare majority by which the Gopinath Shaha resolution passed completed GandhPs discomfiture. In short, Gandhi&apos;s influence as political leadei has considerably waned, and belief in his principles and policy is at very low ebb. 7516     100   7.24
In article in his paper Young India, Gandhi admits that lie has been defeated and humiliated. He wishes to retire from the Congress and confine his activity to.the Khaddar programme, communal tension and regeneration of the depressed classes, but considers that this course cannot now be taken immediately without greatly weakening the Congress organisation. He lias, therefore, decided to retain his position as leader until the Congress issues definite mandate against him.3. View generally taken by Indian press is that the Ahmedabad meeting was clear victory for the Swarajists but personal triumph for Gandhi. We consider it doubtful whether the success achieved by the Swarajists will enable them to pursue their programme without the assistance of Gandhi, whose forthcoming tour in the country next month will show whether he still commands influence over the masses. Gandhi expected suffer defeat at Belgaum session next December, and to retire along with Ali brothers, but saner elements regard his presence as leader essential in order to obviate accession.of strength to the advocates of violence, especially in the Assembly. Strenuous campaign by Gandhi with active support &quot;no changers,&quot; with passive acquiescence of Swarajists, may be expected in favour of constructive programme, with (much, emphasis on ultimate goal &quot;mass civil disobedience.&quot;4.
