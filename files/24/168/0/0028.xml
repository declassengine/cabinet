July 31st, 1924,
In the flatter of the Reference as to the Tribunal under Article 12 of the Schedule appended to the Irish Free- State Agreement Act, 1922.By an Order in Council of date 25th June, 1924,Your Majesty was pleased to refer to this Committeethe following questions1.   Whether, in the absence of a Commissioner appointed by the Government of Northern Ireland, a Commission within the meaning of Article 12 of the Treaty will have been constituted, or can be competent to determine the boundary under that Article ?2.   Whether5 if the answer to the first question is in the negative, it is competent for the Crown. acting on the advice of Ministers of the United Kingdom, to instruct the Governor of northern Ireland) in default of advice from His Ministers, to make an appointment % and for the Governor of Northern Ireland to act upon that instruction; and whether; if the Governor of Northern Ireland makes.an appointment in pursuance of that instruction, the Commission will be duly constituted?3.   Whether, if the answer to the preceding questions is in the negative, it is competent&apos;for the Crown, acting on the advice of Ministers of the United Kingdom? to make the appointment j and whether, if the^ Crown so appoints, the Commission will be duly constituted ?4.   If the answer to all the preceding questions is in the negative:, whether.there is any constitutional method of bringing the Commission into existence, so long as the Ministers of Northern Ireland maintain their refusal ?By another Order of date 25th July, 1924, the followingsupplementary&apos; question was referred:5.   If a Commission is duly constituted composed of (a) two persons or (h) three persons&apos;, whether in case (a) in the event of disagreement the Chairman will have a casting vote and in case (b) in the event of disagreement the vote of a majority will prevail ?The.Lords of the, Coia;dttee thought it righf, to afford an
an opportunity to tho representatives of the Irish Free State and of northern Ireland respect irely to put forward any considerations whioh, in their opinion; ought to have weight in arriving at the answers to the above questions.     The representatives of Northern Ireland appeared before their lordships by counsel;   the representatives of the Irish Free State intimated that they did not desire to be heard.    Yoiir Majesty^ Attorney-General for England intimated a desire to be heard, which was aeoeded to.      Their lordships had submitted to them the correspondence which had taken place between the Government of the Free State and Northern Ireland and the Cclonial Offioe and the Prime - Minister ef Great Britain.Their lordships having taken into consideration the questions submitted beg to report as followsIt appears to their lordships that the question whioh really underlies and provides the key to the first 4 questions is what Is meant in Article 12 of the schedule appended to the Act of Parliament entitled &quot;The Irish Free State Agreement Act, 1922&quot;, 12.Geo*V Oh.4 by the expression &quot;the Government of theFree
Free State, the Governmeiit of Northern Ireland and the British Government&quot; by whom respectively the appoint-menta are to be made.Their Lordships have no hesitation in holding that the expression 13 to be taken in its natural and ordinary meaning, namely the respective exeoutive Governments responsible to their respective Parliaments.    In the case of the Free State, that is the Parliament   which is being created by the Act. In the oaae of Northern Ireland it is the Parliament created by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. Itt the case of the British  Government it is the Imperial Parliament,    In the oases of the Free State and of Northern Ireland the determination of the Government would be constitutionally expressed through the mouth of the Governor as advised by his Ministers. The expression so construed has not only ite natural and everyday meaning but it is so used again and again in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which Act it ia the purpose of the Act of 1922 to alter and amend.
Heaping &quot;this oardinal point in view their Lordships humbly submit the following categorioal answers to the questions pat :-Question 1.Their Lordships think it right to point outthat the words &quot;in the absence of a Commissionerappointed by the Government of Northern Ireland&quot; aresusceptible of a double meaning.     They rnigirt mean that no Commissioner had been appointed.   Thoy might mean that a Commissioner had been appointed but hadabsented himself from all deliberation.   It is clear to their Lordships, from the terms of tho second question, that the meaning is the first of those mentioned.    The answer to the quostifin is in the negative.     The Tribunal designated by Article 12 is a statutory Tribunal brought into existence by the termsof the Artioleo     It is no existing bodya   AnyTribunal, therefore, which did not exaGtly corresponds to the words used in section 12 would not be theTribunal which, under the Aot of Parliament, had a^cnepower to determine the questions for whioh thatTribunal was created. &apos; \Question
Question 2,The answer to this question Is also In the negative.     The reasons have been given in the preliminary observations submitted.     The appointment is not committed to the Governor who only acts in this matter as the mouth piece&apos; of his Ministers responsible to Parliament,     Their Lordships consider that the Governor of the Irish Free State expressed himself with perfect correctness when, in his dispatch of 19th July, 1923, he intimated that, pursuant to Article 12, &quot;my Ministers have nominated&quot; a certain gentleman as the representative of the Iri3h Free State to act on trie Boundary commissioners si on. Question 3.This, also is answered in the negative.     The same considerations as dictated the answer   to question 2 apply here.     In addition their Lordships consider that any view of a remanent prerogative in His Majesty to make such an appointment cannot be entertained.     In the first place it is not a question of settling boundaries but of supplying a casus improviaus in an Act cf Parliament, a prooedure to which the prerogative-5* could   .
oould not be held to extend.   3ut further, even supposing it could be looked on as a question of boundary their Lordships consider that the case of Attorney-General v.. ,De. geyser&apos;b royal Hotel.., Ltd. 1920, Ap. Cas. 511, settled that once any matter which includes something which might fall within the prerogative is dealt with in an Act of Parliament to whioh His Majesty has neoessarily assented, all withinthe ambit of the matter so dealt with, can only be dealt with in the future as the Act of Parliamentdireots and cannot be affected by an exercise of the prerogative outside the provisions of the Act.Question 4.There is in their lordships opinion underthe above hypothesis no constitutional method under the existing statute law. !Ihe Supplemental Question.In view of the answers already given it is apparent that this question cannot apply to any existing state of affairs.   Categorically, however, their lordships answer thus:-
(a) If there were a Commission of Wo thero would be no casting vote appertaining to a Chairman as suoh unless power to that effect had been specifically given in the constituting inatrament0(b) If three Commissioners had once be on appointed then5 although in private arbitrations unanimity is necessary, it is otherwise when the matter to be determined is of public concern,     Shis was settled so long ago as 1798 in the case of Grind-ley Vo Barker Ic Boso &amp; Sulo pcE29, where Chief Justice lyre says ,?I think It is now pretty well establishocl that where a number of persons are entrusted with powers not of mere private confidence, but in some respects cf a general nature, and all of them are already assembled., the majority would conclude the minority and their act will be the aot of the whole,&quot;     Shis case was followed by lord Chancellor 0kirns, Lord Gelborne and several other members ox the Judicial Committee in the matter of an arbitration between the province of Ontario and tho province of Quobeo, where the matter-was referred&apos;by His Majesty to the Judicial Committee,
The case is reported in 4 Cartwright&apos;s cases on the British North America Act, p,712. The case had to do with section 142 of the British North America Act, where a certain matter was to be referred to the arbitrament of three arbitrators, one appointed by the Government of Ontario, one by the Government of Quebec, and one by the Government of Canada. One of the arbitrators had retired. Lord. Selborne says "the view which prevails that unanimity is necessary when power is given to three persons does not depend on anything peculiar to arbitrations, it surely would be a general view subject to control either by something expressed in the instrument or by something to be collected from the nature of the power and the duty to be performed under it."  And then he puts the question "Is not one reason for the distinction that in the public interest it is necessary that the thing should be decided ?"; and their Lordships&apos; answers were given in accordance with
with this view.     These authorities seem to their Lordships conclusive.     They have no doubt that this is a matter of public interest and not a matter of merely private concern between the parties concerned and they, therefore, answer that though in accordance with their answer to Question I if no appointment is made the Commission cannot go on, yet if once the three appointments had boen made, a majority would rule.All of which is humbly reported to Your Majesty by Your humble and obedient servants.(Signed)     BUKEDIN. , &quot; BIApSBU JC3 .&quot; LAWRENCE JENKINS.l.Po mm,&quot; &apos;  ADRIAN EE OX.July 31st., .1924.
