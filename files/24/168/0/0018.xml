fa&amp;W%SEB&apos;2    1.     A Conference of Ministers was held for the purposejjlJTTEE.       o:f considering the Reports prepared by the Unemployment3RMS Of^2, Grants Committee as a result of visits paid to and information received from various Local Authoritiesin regard to schemes for the Relief of Unemploymentin 1924-E5.     The Conference had before them thefollowing documents:-Preliminary Report by the Unemployment Grants Committee, C.U. 689,Extract from the 14th Conclusions of the Unemployment Sub-Committee.Supplementary Report by the Unemployment Grants Committee&apos;, C.U. 689A.Third Interim Report of the Proceedings of the Unemployment Grants Committee, C.U.692,THE 10RD PRIVY SSAi summarised the position tfeich had been reached and reminded the Committee that in the view of Lord St. Davids it would be a waste of public money to improve the terms to the local authorities. He informed the Committee that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was still strongly opposed to the extension of the grants, and that if the Committee were of the contrary opinion the Chancellor would like an opportunity of disousslng the matter further with his colleagues. He (Mr. Snowien). was unable to attend that day owing to a meeting at the same time in connection with the Reparations Conference.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE called attention to the 3iffleulty of modifying- the present terms for the more necessitous areas only and for this year only.     There appeared to be only S or 6 towns who were not, for one reason or another, fully met by the existing arrangements and the additional employment which would be found by them, if their demands were conceded, would not be considerable.    further, it was very likely that onoe they knew that the present terms were definitely fixed they would modify their attitude and set&apos;l;schemes in motion. - i .-SsSMSssias
It might be possible to bring pressure on these towns without a ohangs of grant.   It could be pointed out to them that the Government was rendering considerable assistance centrally through the Unemployment Insurance Act, the grants in aid of roads, and the forthcoming development of electrical policy.   He (Mr. Webb) had thought it might be possible to separate some specific class of relief work and give it more generous treatment than was normally accorded by the Unemployment Grants Committee but he had been unable to discover a satisfactory way of doing this.MB. REY pointed out that if a change were made favourable to the local authorities there would be a demand that it should be made retrospective..     Schemes already approved and for which payments would fall to be made in the future would be re-submit ted as qualifying for the new terms.THE MIIISTER OS1 LABOUR said he found himself in the same difficulty as the President of the Board of Trade.     He saw no way of confining any advance in the terms to tho five or six towns in a special position.THE PliliHCIAI SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY stated that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was opposed to going&apos; beyond the present terms;   that he was confirmed in this view after reading the Reports of the visits of the officers of the Unemployment Grants Committee, and that there was everything to be gained by a firm announcement of the Government&apos;s decision to stand on the present terms.     In his view work v/ould then go ahead.     At present paragraphs in the newspapers were unsettling and the Government should in their announcement emphasise the assistance which was being made through (a) Unemployment Insurance which would otherwise fall on the guardians; (b) their Electricity Programme (c) their Road programme and (c) Post
Office extansions. 115MB. REY suggested that it would he useful to state puhlioly that whereas at this time last year the Government had approved schemes to the value of     million for the forthooming winter, this year there were already approved schemes to ihe value of  4 millions.THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, MINISTRY OP HEALTH (Who arrived at this stage of the proceedings) stated that the Minister of Health had not altered his views as a result of a perusal of the Reports of the Unemployment Grants Committee.    It was clear from the Reports that there were some towns which were taking the grants with a had grace.      The Reports threw little light on the position of the smaller industrial areas which had a relatively low rateable value.    He (Mr. Greenwood) agreed that it was very difficult to define a necessitous area or to find a formula whioh would remove them for separate treatment from other areas.     In his view if more schemes were to be called forth the only way was to inorease the finanoial inducement.    The smaller relief works had been carried out.    Local authorities were anxious about the obligations they had already incurred and not inolined to undertake fresh burdens.THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE TR.Ea.SURY said the last point might possibly be met by some revision of the sinking fund arrangements, such as an extension of the period of repayment, but he did not suppose that prospect would arouse enthusiasm as the immediate relief would be email.THE LCRL PRIVY SEAL said that if in any way it were possible to do more to help the local authorities it should be done.     The present Government should go beyond its predecessors in granting&apos; assistance.    The matter was one of urgency in view of the debate in * Parliament
usmon Wednesday and he suggested that the question should he referred to the Cabinet at their next meeting. He should like to see an estimate prepared by the Unemployment Grants Committee of what the additional burden to the State would have h een last year assuming the grants in each category had been 10 per cento more than they actually were,MR. BEY pointed out that local authorities complained that they did not receive the full 60 per cent, of wages for works financed otherwise than &quot;by loan because the 60 per cent, was calculated on the unemployed men taken on for the job, and excluded the wages of the men in control of the job, who were usually permanent employees, THE COMMITTEE agreed1.   That the question whether the terms ofassistance now offered by the Unemployment Grants Committee should be made more favourable to the local authorities should be referred to the Cabinet at their next meeting for decision before the debate on Unemployment in the House of Commons which was due to take place on &quot;Wednesday afternoon.2.   That the Unemployment Grants Committee should provide fur the Cabinet an estimate of the additional cost which would have heen incurred by the State &apos;   last winter had the terms of assistance been increased by 10 per cent, in each categoryoThat the Reports of the Officers of the Unemployment Grants Committee vho had visited a number of local authorities should be circulated to tho Cabinet.&amp;S FOR 2,        Th3 Committee&apos;s attention was drawn by theHOHDSHT OF&quot;piSG SITES. Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health, to the desirability of reminding local authorities by Circular of the fact that the Unemployment Grants Committee is prepared to grant half the interest for -

On the next day arrangements were made with various Local Authorities for visits by Officers of the Committee, the objects of the visit being -(i)     To ascertain, -as far as possible, the extent to which schemes for the relief of unemployment were likely to be forthcoming for the Autumn and Winter;(ii) to assist Local Authorities in the initiation and formulation of such schemes,(iii) to discover what real difficulties, if any, there were in.the way of^further schemes coming forward and to assist in the removal of such difficulties.The Officers, Captain Horris snd iiiir.Godd.ard, have visited in all 35 towns representative of various industries and degrees of unemployment in Lancashire, Yorkshire, the Midlands, the South of England, the Morth East Coast and South Wales.In addition arrangements were made through the Sc6ttish Office with the Chief Inspector of the Scottish Board of Health for a number of Authorities in Scotland to be visited for the same purpose by Officers of that Lepartme Eleven Scottish Authorities were seen.   The total number, of places visited was therefore 46.Further it was possible to interview in London and to obtain reports from a number of other Authorities, including the London County Council./The

It would appear that there will actually be proceeding in the towns indicated above works to the value,of  2,000,000 during the seven months, September to March inclusive.
A comparison with, last yearV figures has boon .made of 30 County Boroughs visited, in which the volume of work which, any bo put up for tho coming Winter amounts to approximately  6,216,000.2he amount of work approved for the year 1923-4 from these same Boroughs amounted to  6,272,000, or approximately the same figures     2ae total value of all schemes approved for the wholo country for that year was very nearly  22,000,000 or approximately      times the figure for the 30 Boroughs visited.As stated above the value of schemes proposed for 1924-5 by those same 30 Boroughs is  6,218,000;   -and assuming that they may be regarded as forming the same proportion of schemes to be submitted by the whole country as they did last year there would appear to be a possibility of a total amount of  21,750,000 worth of works being forthcoming for 1924-5, or allowing for rejections, about  20,000,000.An examination of the detailed reports of the visiting Officers would appear to support this hypothesis.She prospects would, on the whole, and with certain notable exceptions appear to be satisfactory and the general impression (apart from figures and statistical estimates) that may be formed as a result of the various interviews, visits and reports, seems to indicate that taking the country as a wholo probably nearly as much work will bo forthcoming during next.Autumn and Winter as was tho case last year.     On the other hand in the North of England it seems unlikely that the response to tho Government invitation in that part of the country will be extensive as heretofore.2be attitude of .the Local Authorities generally speaking appears to be sorawha-t as follows:-.
This being the fifth Winter of serious unemployment thoy may have to some  extent acquired the attitude of regarding unemployment as a permanence and have in many cases lost that keen desire to look around to try and find work to relieve tho position which, was characteristic in the first year or two.     On the other hand thoy seam in most oases to be felly prepared to co-operate with the Government in working schemes for tho relief of -unemployment and to of for all help in their power.   On this account, therefore, tho visit of the representatives of tho Unemployment Grants Committee has had an admirable result in forcing their   attention to the problem and in causing a number of schemes to be put forward which otherwise would very possibly not have seen the light of day.In addition many difficulties have been smoothed over, and some valuable suggestions for assisting the progress of schemes generally have been made. 2h.ese will be examined and will form the subject of a further report.On the other hand, there is no doubt but that the Authorities are feeling the pinch cf the necessity for the continued provision for unemployment not so much in the level of their rates alone as in the heavy indebtedness whioh they are piling up by way of loans for such work.   For this reason it is perfectly: ovldent that thoy will not undertake works to any extent without Government assistance.   It is not that they wish to extract the uttermost farthing from tho Government but rather that they feel that they cannot justifiably incur farther liabilities without State aid.
They have in the last few years been putting in hand ^accelerated&quot; works, that is to say, works which, would not be done a tall at the present time and which indeed need not be dons except to relieve unemployments    But they are now rather forced back on work which really ought to be done now in the ordinary oourse but which, owing to the financial burdens they have undertaken for &quot;accelerated&quot; works, they feel quits unable to proceed with at the present time without State assistance.It is a fact that the difficulties experienced by tho Committee in deciding whether works have been sufficiently &quot;accelerated&quot; noticeably, increased during the past winter - it is to be anticipated that these will be still greater next Winter.It is therefore the view of the Committee that if they are to get tho maximum of effort put forward by tho Local Authorities and if they are bo derive the maximum benefit from tho visits of thoir officers it will be necessary to interpret somewhat more widely than has been done hitherto the &quot;acceleration&quot; condition.There are many works for instance which it is . very desirable that Local Authorities should undertake but which they are not legally bound by Statute to do now.     Where it appears reasonably evident that they will in fact not undertake these at tho present moment owing to thoir other burdens without State assistance, such assistance should not necessarily be refused.     Otherwise it is unlikely that the volume of work put in hand will roach the same level as heretofore.
1 9/3X iJParticular attention was directed by the Committeers officers to the limited assistance which could be given for the development of housing sites (i-e, roads and drainage schemes) and the impression derived was that many local Authorities did not at all realise that any assistance from the Unemployment Grants Committee was available,,     In a number of cases Authorities seemed to think that a good deal of work could bs &quot;undertaken -en this basis and proposed forth-with to examine the possibilities.    This may lead to an Increase in the number of schemes proposed,,     Of course the only terms mentioned to the Authorities were the existing terms.As regards the class of schemes proposed, so far as can be seen from the particulars supplied the schemes are fairly evenly divided be tee en revenue-producing and non-revenue producing work.An interesting point which emerged from the interviews was the great value attached by many local Authorities to the provision of Parks and Pleasure Grounds * lot only did these afford more relief per   spent to local unemployed, but the work when done was stated to be of the greatest value in providing recreation and open air for the inhabitants (bowling greens, tennis courts, cricket pitches, etc) attracting them from less desirable occupations and improving &apos;their health,,In the opinion of many Authorities, these JSToilities for healthy open-air recreation and exercise must inevitably tend in the future to reduce expenditure on health services,,
The Authorities from whom lit tie may he expected in tho way of work for the Winter, if their present attitude be maintained, fall roughly into three categories,(1) Those who say that it is practically Impossible to find works of a helpful character owing to the work already done and the limitations of their districts, (2) those who say that they cannot find works to be done and that the Government terras are inadequate, .(3) those where there is admittedly work t o be done but who refuse to do it because of the alleged inadeqra&amp;ey of the terms.As regards the first of these categories (Bury, Gates head, Manchester, Salford and Wolverhampton) the impression obtained as a result of the visits paid is that the statement probably represents the true facts of the ease, except pe rhaps in Manchester^     These Authorities genuinely feel that they have not got any more work which they would be justified in putting in hand at the moment.With regard to Manchester, however, it is only fair to point out that they had officially submitted a definite scheme to cost  450,000 a few days before the visit of tho representative of the Gomaittee, which is almost as much as the value of all the schemes submitted by them last year. And presumably they propose to go on with this scheme.In tho case of Bury, the Corporation are quite anxlouS&quot; to put schemes in hand and they have asked the heads of all the departments what can be done-.     They have even consulted the unemployed themselves as to what they could suggest but local circumstances are such that no work can be found to do.In Gateshead the Corporation are anxious to find work and are having a further meeting to consider the possibilities but so far they have not been able to produce anything.
As regards Salford, the Borough Engineer stated that&quot;*il he were given a free gift of half a million pounds to provide schemes ha could not thick of any.In the oase of Wolverhampton they cannot, as the town is situated, at present deviee more schemes.   If the Eoyal Commission whioh is now considering the general question of Borough boundaries, recommends the extension of the limits of the Borough, then they say there will be a good deal of work whioh oould and would be done in the enlarged borough.The seoond category i.e. those Authorities which consider both that there are no special unemployment schemer.: which could be done and also that the Government terra are ir&amp;daquate (Liverpool and Newcastle) use arguments which arc mutually destructivet   Obviously if there is no work which can be done it does not matter what the Government terms are.In faot so far as Liverpool is concerned, the general impression is that they are displaying and have displayed a great deal of apathy as regards the unemployment question. They are, however, very anxious that the Government should press on with two large schemes viz* a new road from Liverpool to West Lancashire and a tunnel under the Mersey, estimated to cost something like  8,000,000 and  3,000,000 respectively, the oircumstanoea (and difficulties) of whioh are fully known to the Ministry of Braneport.In the case of Newcastle on Tyae, the probability is that the question of terms ia really more important than the absence of work.    It is quite true that the official view of the Corporation was, as expressed by the Town Clerk, that there was no work to be done, but on the other hand the Committee^ representative understood from the Deputy Borough Engineer that he had quite a number of works whioh might be put in hand if the Corporation were willing.As to the thirl category, there is only one Authority
which was Interviewed by representatives of the. -OommiJstee^i,^ whioh said that they had plenty of work to bo done but refused to do it on account of the alleged inadequaoy of the Government terms, namely, Sheffield.    Here a list of schemes amounting to no less than *700v000 was submitted by the Oounoilrs Officers to the finance Committee last week but they did not feel disposed to agree to it in view of the considernation by the Government of their request for increased terms.It is fairly obvious that having be on practically the Instigators of a movement to obtain increased terms, Sheffield feel that it would stultify their position to agree to put forward schemes on the existing terms.   Ihe probability is that when they realise that the existing terms are all they oan get, and when tho local pressure of unemployment is felt more strongly they will in feet submit their schemes for grant.They stated indeed that beyond the issue of the Unemployment Grants Committee Circular they had had no official reply to their request far improved terms.0.F.HEY18th July, 1924.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 14th July, 1924.

So far as this is practicable efforts will be made to make arrangements of this nature in consultation with Local Authorities during the next few weeks..It is hoped that Local Authorities will once again co-operate with the Government and that it will be possible for them to put in hand at least as much work as was done last winter Avhen, as a result of their co-operation, the Committee were enabled to approve for grant schemes to the value of nearly  20,000,000.The terms on which State assistance was afforded last winter are set out overleaf, and it has been decided by the Government that these terms will again be offered for&apos; works which can be commenced during the coming winter.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,secretary.(A copy of this Circular is forwarded herewith for the information of the Surveyor to the Council.)

What further latitude is required as to theinterpretation of the Acceleration&apos; condition.II.   Details as to those municipalities which had expressed themselves as unwilling to proceed with further work in view of the inadequacy of the Government terms. - -It &apos; THE &quot;ACCELKRATIOH&quot; CONDITION.The &quot;acceleration1 condition on which the Committee lave hitherto insisted, is that &quot;works which would not be prc-eeded with at the present time apart from tha pressing need for the relief of unemployment are alona eligible&quot;.The interpretation which the Committee have, as a general rule, given to this condition, is that it must bo shown to their satisfaction that the work proposed for grant would be so Accelerated As to be completed before tho time that it would ordinarily oe commenced.,fih certain cases where the completion of the work rather&apos;, than the Commencement is &quot;accelerated&apos;, that is to say where, for example, work which would normally be completed in two years is to be done by &quot;acceleration&apos; in ono year, the Committee have given a grant in respect of part of the expenditure representing the Accelerated5 portion.Sow, however, that sane Local Authorities are finding it more difficult to produce suitable schemes of work and are moreover putting off on account of financial stringency work which ought to be done, the Committee feel that it will be necessary for tbsm to interpret somewhat more broadly than in the past the
1 acceleration&apos; condition, if Local Authorities are to be en-courugad to do as much as possible this winter.   For example, the Committee have before them two schemes fftam the City of Manchester amounting to  536,000 in value in connection with their Gas Works.   These schemes would normally be commenced In the summer of 1925 and would take two years to complete.The Corporation are, however, prepared to coiamenoe the schemes forthwith and to complete thorn in 15 months.   In other words, to decelerate&apos; the commencement by about 10 months and to shorten the duration of work by about 9 months.Under their existing interpretation of the oonditlon the Committee feel a one hesitation in approving those schemes for grants and it wa3 schemes of thi3 olass that the committee had in mind when thsy suggested in their preliminary report of the 12th. July, 1924, that it would be desirable for them to be authorised to oxeroise greater latitude than has been done hitherto in the interpretation of the deceleration&apos; condition.The QoTffiSlttee feel that they should net be bound by too literal an interpretation of the condition, and they therefore regard it as desirable that they should be empowered to approve for grant so homes as a whole, which are otherwise suitable, where the element of acceleration enters to any appreciable extent either aa to commencement or as to completion, should the general circumstances appear to justify grant.fe MUNICIPALITIES UNWILLING TO PROCESS WITH WORK.As pointed out in the Committee&apos;s preliminary repor^, the.towns who say they are unwilling to proceed on account of the inadequacy of the terms are Sheffield, Liverpool and   &apos; Newca3tle-on-Tyne.     Since then,   a letter has been resolved to the same effect from Walaall,   although .at the interview wjfi&amp;ih tho Committee &apos;s Offioer had with various officials of the Corporation on the 3rd. July a list of works amounting to approximately  50,000 was proposed.
1 *1A. W a(a) Sheffield - So far as Sheffield is concerned,the following is an extract frorc a report from Mr.Goddard who Interviewed the Town Clerk and other officials of the Corporation on the 1st July.EXTRACT   m0%   HEIGHT.&quot;Interviewed Town Clerk, City Purveyor, Parks Suporln-tendent and Improvement Surveyor.Town Clerk referred to recent deputation from Muncioal Corporations Association to Minister of Health and wished to make it quite clear that, while a list of Possible schemes for next Winter had beon orepared by the heads of Departments and was on that day to be out before the Finance Committee, the Corporation^ decision would dopend upon the result of the application for improved terms of assistance.   It was noted that Unemployment Grants Committee terms had not been altered and if this was final, it was by no means certain that the Corporation would proceed with, further schemes. The financial burden upon the Corporation was too heavy.Later in the day* I w^s informed that the Finance Commit-tee&quot; had considered the list of schemes which had been prepared but were not diaoosed to approve the adoption of the schemes on the present terms of assistance.&quot;As pointed out in the Committee&apos;s report schemes amounting to  700,000 are available and could be put in hand.   There is consequently no dearth of work, but as tho Committee pointed out, Sheffield, having been practically the leaders of the movement to obtain improved terms, no doubt feel that it would.stultify their position to agree to put forward schemes on the existing terms.   The probability is that when they realise that the existing terms are all they can get and when the local pressure of unemployment is felt more strongly they will in fact submit their schemes for grant.Sine the inauguration of the Committee&apos;s work in 1020, schemes to the value of  785,000 have been approved on the loan baaia, and schemes to the value of  116,000 on the 60$ wages basis in Sheffield, making a total of just over  900,000 divided fairly equally between the three winters.Schemes to the value of  42,000 already sanctioned by the Committee will be running through the winter.
The rates in Sheffield last year -wsre 20/lOd. and this year ere 18/-.   This must doubtless include provision for       J0m the works already sanctioned, and the burden on the rates of these works should probably, at a rough approximation, be appreciably less than l/- in the  , or taking an average for the period probably about 9d.   A. id. rate produces aporoxi-mately  9,000.(b) Liverpool.As regards Liverpool the following is an extract from o report from Mr.Goddard who interviewed the Town Clerk and the Chairman of the Finance Committee:-EXTRACT   PROM.   REPORT.&quot;Interviewed Sir John Utting, Chairman of Finance Committee, and the Town Clerk.The Town Clerk stated that the terms of assistance were not adequate, the Corporation were not disposed to put further schemes of work in hand under present terms, even if suitable works could be found.    In fact, however, the well has run dry for netty schemes.   They are found to be too expensive to the Town,   Heads of Departments will not recommend schemes.Sir John 0&apos;ttlng said, with much emphasis that what was wanted were large schemes of national importance which would give employment not only to large numbers of unskilled men in the locality of the work but also to 3killed men In various trades throughout the country.In particular he wanted to press two schemes now before the Ministry of Transport, namely, Mersey Tunnel scheme to cost from  6,000,000 to  7,000,000;   New road&apos;from Liverpool to East Lancashire to cost about  3,000,000,These two schemes are the best In their region for relief of unemployment.   Between 50 and 60% of the labour would be unskilled,The new road would be from 30 - 40 miles in length,about 10 miles of which would be in Liverpool.   This scheme would provide employment throughout Lancashire.    It could start at once, if adequate assistance was forthcoming from the Government,It was suggested that the Ministry of Transport are In favour of both schemes and that the only question outstanding is as to extent of Government assistance. The Local Authorities apparently want special terms on the ground that the works are cf national importance.Apart from these two schemes, there is also a proposed new road through Everton Hill in the City.   It is expected that this would be aided by ministry of Transport, but. it has not yet matured.   The estimated cost is  170,000.Some other Ministry of Transport schemes &quot;are also ocmingalong.The position as regards unemployment in the City will be much the same as In past three Winters.
190i. ij UThe two big schemes referred to in this Report do not, apparently, come within the range of immediate practical politics, as it is understood that statutory powers would be required and the schemes would crobably meet with considerable opposition.     This, however, is a matter primarily for the Ministry of Transport.The rates in Liverpool were 16/9 in 1922-23, 14/2 in 1923-24, and 13/2 in 1924-86.A Id,rate produces approximately   0,000/The total value of the schemes sanctioned in Liverpool since the initiation of the Committee&apos;s work were  08 0,000 for schemes on the loan basis, and  471,000 for schemes on the 60/* wages basis, making a total value of  1,051,000.     As in the case of Sheffield, provision for these schemes must have already been included in the rates, which cannot bo said to be very high in comparison with many other towns.Schemes to the value of over  100,000 already sanctioned will be running through the Winter.(c)     Hewcastle-on-Tyne.As regards Hewcastle, the position is as set out clearly in the Report from Mr.Goddard who interviewed the Town Clerk.&quot;Interviewed Town Clerk.On two occasions the Corporation have r.. Ministers their views on the question of reli. unemployment.    What is wanted are large works v. national character and works of joint benefit to or more local authorities.The works which an individual local authority can put in hand are coming to an end.       In the case of
NewcastLe^pon^tfJyns, there is very littie-which can be done by the Corporation alone.She &apos;Jown Clerk&apos;s view is that the . quest ion cf unemployment is a national one and not local.     The whole country should boar the cost of relief works, and not leave the bulk of the burden to bo borne by the local authorities in whose areas unemployment exists..    Industrial ar&amp;as exist for the benefit of tho country an a whole.There is a joint work with Gateshead which it is hoped to start this year.     This work consists of the construction of a bridge betweeh Newcastle and Gateshead.     It will oost about  1,000,000, and financial assistance is expected from the Ministry of Transport.Statutory authority for tobstruction of the bridge is contained in a Bill new before Parliament.Tho Deputy Borough Engineer gave me the following particulars of works now in hand which would run through the Winter:-Beaton and Walker Main Sewor 120 menRoad to Coast (Joint scheme with Wallsend, Longbonton &amp; Tynemouth) 120 men Wingrove Road Extension,The Engineer has prepared a tentative list cf schemes of work for next Winter; but did not feel at liberty to give me the list or any particulars because it had net yet baon before the Corporation, He oould not aay when (if ever) the schemes wera likely to materialise.&quot;The rates in Newcastle are as follows 19/6 for 1923-24 and also for 1924-25. A Id. rate produces about  7,000. The volume of works approved for grant by the Committee since its initiation Is appreciably smaller than In the two other tpwns referred to, amounting only te  442,000, of whioh  413,000 are for works on tho loan basis, &quot;and  29,000 for works en the 60$ wages basis.Sohemes&apos; to tho value of  80,000 will be running through the Winter.(d)   WalsallAs regards Walsall the visiting officer reported that works to the value of about  50,000 would be put in hand for next Winter.     Since then however the following letter has. been received from the Corporation:-
1 ini.     \jCOUNTY BOROUGH OP WALSALL.Town Clerk1a Office,Council House.;The Secretary, WAVwALL.Unemployment Relief Works,23,Buckingham Gate, 17th July, 1924,LONDON, S,W,X,Sir,WORKS for the RELIEF of unemployment the Town Council of Walsall and ita various committee have had under consideration your Oiv&quot;huar Letters of the 27th February and 27th June last w:V;h reference to Unemployment Relief Works, and I enclose herewith copy of a list of wox^ks which, subject aa under-mentioned, the Council is prepared to put in hand for the purpose of providing additional work for the relief of Unemployment during the current Summer and during the Winter of 1924-25.The submission of the acoompanying list, however, is subject to adequate Government assistance being forth-ooming, and the Town Council have passed the following resolution&quot;That in the opinion of this Council the grants now offered by the Government towards the oost of unemployment relief works uudor-taken by Local Authorities are quite inadoifiate, particularly as regards non-revenue producing works, and that the Gouncil cannot, unions auch grants are substantially Increased, undertake to carry out the works included in the list now submitted.&quot;In places, such as Walsall, which have been so hard hit by the abnormal unemployment during the past three years, the amount of Indebtedness already incurred for Unemployment Relief Works is so great and the rates are so excessive owing to unemployment and the trade depression, that the Town Council feel they must call a halt in regard to additional Schemes involving large expenditure, unless the Government can increase the assistance offered, particularly in regard to non-revenue producing works, whioh on the present basis, works out at a proportion of only about 30$ leaving 70$ of the loan charges to be borne locally.    Moreover, in order to earn this Inadequate Government grant, the prescribed condi-tions have to be adhered to, which necessarily prevent the Local Authority from obtaining the full economic return from the labour employed.My Council trust that on further consideration the Government will be able to increase the grants so aa to enable Local Authorities where the burden of unemploy-ment has been greatest to provide more work for the unemployed next Winter.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) HERBERT LEE,Town Clerk.
