3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.0 A B I N E T. THE TRADE POSITION AND PROSPECTS. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I oiroulate, for the information of the Cabinet, a note of the views as to the Trade Outlook, whioh were expressed confidentially by the members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council at the meeting on 6th October.The general tendency of these reports is more hopeful than those whioh were given to me at the August meeting. I would refer to the remarks of Mr, Baring on page 9 as being a fair summary of the present situation.   The Federation of British Industries also report a slight all-round tendency for the betterj though, it i3 true, the Association of Chambers of commerce say that their information does not tend to disclose any general improvement.In addition to the Ooal Trade referred to by Mr. Baring, General Engineering and oertain branches of the Iron and Steel Industries are suffering from continued depression. The prospects of the Cotton Trade have, on the other hartd, materially improved; the American orop is unexpectedly good, prices of raw cotton have fallen, there is a good demand for Yarn and Cloth, and conditions promise to be more favourable during the ensuing months than for several years past.   The lighter branches of Eleotrioal Engineering, such &apos;as telephony, lamp-nanufaoture, etc, are also more actively engaged than they have been of late.TCrd *, 471 (2-4).(Intel.).

4MX.  ... .^SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON said that the position of the shipping industry had. not materially altered.   There had been some Improvement in freights, espeoially for long voyages, notably to Australia and the Plate.    Freights usually exhibited an upward tendenoy in the autumn.   Redundant tonnage still remained the governing faotorj but this had now been reduoed somewhat) Lloyds register showed a net reduction in total tonnage this year for the first time for a considerable time past.    This was, however, due in the main to the breaking up of  old and wooden vessels, whioh had already ceased to be effective.   A oertain number of new orders were being plaoed for speoial ships (a large proportion of these with Diesel engines), but no big flow of orders for tramp tonnage was ooming in at present, or appeared likely to oome for some time.Shipowners had disoussed the Russian Treaty, and, while refraining from examining the proposed loan, had oome to the oonolusion that it constituted a dangerous departure from this oountry&apos;s fixed praotioe.ENGINEERING - GENERAL TRADE.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR   said that depression continued in engineering tools .and the Sheffield steel trade generally. There was a falling off in the Japanese and South American trades.   The depressed oondition of the alloy trade was also an ominous signs its position waB now as bad as two years ago and hardly any alloys could be sold.- A general want of oonfidenoe was felt. This had been exaggerated by pessimistic newspaper reports, which had, he thought, done much harm.- Low prices were still ruling; it was diffioult to carry on export trade at a profit, and exohange rates were a further impediment.With regard to the Russian Treaty, the Chambers of commerce took the view that while it contained oertain desirable olauses,others were of an unsatisfactory character. The loan proposals were viewed with much uneasiness by the trading community.As regards machine tools, he understood that, while the Exhibition might have stimulated the demand to some slight extent, no substantial improvement could be looked for till a general revival in trade took plaoe.In general, British costs of production continued too high.- COLONEL ARMSTRONG thought that the,.reports received by the Federation of British Industries might be taken to indicate oome slight all-round tendency to improvement.General engineering, however, remained in as bad a oondition as ever.   He had not heard any encouraging reports in regard to maohine tools: perhaps a few orders had been
confidential.ENGINEERING g GENERAL TRADE (Oontd.)plaoed as a result of the Exhibition, but not to the extent whioh had been anticipated.The Federation of British Industries had disoussed the Russian Treaty, and while they would welcome any increase in trade with Russia, they felt that too high a-price oould be paid for it..  He referred to the Foreign Office. Committee which was now examining proposals for applying the Boxer Indemnity Fund.   The industrial oommunity generally were anxious that they should be represented on this committee, but had been told that the suggestion oould not be entertained.    In view of the magnitude of the sum at atake, some  4,000,000, it seemed Important that every avenue should be explored for seouring its best utilisation.    He asked if the Board oould not see its way to support the views of business interests in this.     It was understood that Wu Pel Fu favoured the use of the indemnity for railways, and this was one of the things whioh British Industrialists desired, though a-recent answer had been given&apos; in Parliament on behalf of the Govem-raent stating that it was not the intention so to aoply the fund.Mr. Alexander said that note would be taken of these representations, but the matter wsb one for the Foreign Office: he feared that no hope oould be held out of the constitution of the Committee being altered.Proceeding, Colonel Armstrong said that the Federation of British Industries had reoeived representations in regard to the new Greek Tariff *   There was understood to be an intention to impose high duties on(1) soap and perfumery (2) oarpets.He had been asked to express the hope that every effort would be made to protect the industries of this oouhtry in this respect.Sir Sydney Chapman Baid that an Inter-Departmental   -meeting on the subjeot- of the Greek tariff had taken plaoe the previous day, and the Board would, in aooordanoe with its usual praotioe, consult business Interests.ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.Mr. HIRST said that the lighter branch of the Electrical Industry, whioh produced telephone apparatus, lamps, oables and the like, was experiencing distinctly greater activity, and more men were being taken on.Of the heavy branch there was quite a different story to tell.   Works were still bUBy with orders plaoed at the end of last year, but praotioally no fresh orders had been plaoed during the last few months, owing to the stagnation in the staple heavy industries of the country.   One or two orders had also been lost to foreign competitors.It was a point whioh should, he felt, be borne in raird in any negotiations for an Anglo-Gernan Treaty that the level of German wages for skilled labour in engineering was only 6d. an hour as against 15d. per hour in this country, and labour was a very large elene.it in costs in heavy electrioal-a-
m- CONFIDENTIALt ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (Oontd.)engineering.    German competition was to a considerable extent disguised by the ramifications of their enterprise in Holland and Switzerland.IRON &amp; STEEL.Mr. DORMAN said that the position of the steel Trade was oritioal, though Press reports had painted an unduly gloomy pioture of it.Our production of&apos; Pig Iron was going down, while that of other countries, taken over a period of 10 years past, was creeping up.   Our output per unit (i,e., per furnaoe), however, was going up, and the pen were working well.The Sheet Trade, whioh was an important branoh, was quite good; if his own firm and others thought they oould depend on orders for Sheet bars, they eould bring plant into work whioh would produoe bars at  6.10.0 per ton, a very low prioe for this oountry, rendered possible by the economies whioh oould be effected by ooncentrating on one line.   Even so however, bars oould be bought at 15/- per ton less from abroad.   The sheet trade was becoming more dependent on supplies from abroad; if these onoe supplanted home produotion the foreign makers might raise considerably the level of prioes.It was true that a large business was being done with Australia and probably   more would be done in the future.Shipbuilding continued poor: orders for plates were tailing off, but there was some prospeot of a few fresh orders for ships being plaoed in the near future.In connection with certain work whioh his firm were doing in Bombay for oontraotors and for the   Bombay Corporation, he wished to draw attention to the oondition imposed by the Corporation that no goods produced in any part of the British Empire other than India should be used, if they oould be got as cheaply anywhere else in the world. Any steps whioh oould be taken to deal with this unreasonable attitude would be appreolated.Mr, LINDSAY said he was aware of the Bombay Corporation&apos;s oondition but was disposed.to regard it merely as a polio!tal manoeuvre, and doubted if in practice it had had any material result.Mr. DORMAN said he oould quote a case where an order had been given to a Frenoh firm at 60$ over the British tender.
CONFIDENTIAL.IRON &amp; STEEL (Contd.)Mr. BAKER said that the eteel trade was not experiencing good times; but, in spite, of this, the employers had inoreased wages 1/Sd, a shift for the lowest^pald grades, and the numbers of unemployed had to some extent decreased.It was noticeable, however, that while forty-seven blast furnaces had been put into blast again in the United States, none had been in Great Britain.    At the same time, the prioe of the ordinary shares of iron and steel concerns in this country had risen a little during the last two weeks! he hoped this could be read as a sign of somo coming improvement in the trade.With regard to the inoreases lately shown In the Government&apos;s statiBtios of unemployment, it would be of interest to know how far thie was attributable to -changes made by reoent legislation.     It might perhaps be doubted whether there were actually more men unemployed in August than in July.Mr. PHILLIPS said that the New Unemployment Insurance Act oame into Force at the&quot; beginning of August, and the increased rates of benefit took effeot from mid-August. Any Increase of numbers before August was not attributable to the Act, and, in fact, there were substantial increases in the numbers unemployed, in July.      At the same time, the Ministry of Labour were inolined to think that eome part of the reoent increase was due to an effect of the Act in bringing on the register unemployed persons who might not previously have registered.    The Act had altered the position in regard to trade disputes, since now persons who were thrown out of work by a trade dispute without  -themselves being on strike beoame qualified for benefit, as also persons who went on strike owing to a breach of a national or district agreement by their employers.   Other provisions of the Act affeoted persons out of employment for very short periods.      The Ministry of Labour were trying to get a closer estimate; but at present they were disposed to think that not more than half of the inorease sinoe the end of July was due to the operation of the new Act.
Ji JX \JIRON &amp; STEEL (Oontd.)SIR GLYNN WEST wrote*I have nothing muoh to add to my previous statement, except to say that my prediction of a- worse slump in the Engineering and Steel and Iron Trades is beginning to materialise.&quot;The number of blast furnaces in operation has decreased, and it is becoming Increasingly difficult to obtain orders, even at prioes whioh show no profit.&quot;This fact is emphasized in the reoent oaseB of India and Burma having plaoed large contraotB for railway material in Germany, and it is known that in several industries Looal Government bodies have plaoed orders for tramway rails and other material on the continent.    There is a continual fall in the demand for this country&apos;s steel products, and muoh uncertainty surrounds the future conditions of the trade.&quot;OOAL.Mr. EVAN WILLIAMS wrotej-&quot;The position in the Export and Industrial Ooal Trade is even worse than when I last reported.    Pressure of foreign competition has increased and even in south Amerioa the Germans are able to undercut us, and have taken a large contraot in the Argentine at 2/- per ton less than South Wales figures.   Until the oost of produotion in this oountry can be materially reduced, ther1? seems to be no prospect of improvement.   Indeed it ia to be feared that we have not yet seen the worst&quot;.TEXTILES (COTTON).Mr. HOLROYD . said it was gratifying to note that a marked improvement had taken plaoe in the state of the cotton trade, and it might indeed be hoped that the corner had now been turned.   Pull time, it was true, was not yet being worked generally as it was thought that this would not be prudent in view of the position so far disclosed by the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federations weekly returnsj but those works whioh were, on full time were not experiencing losses, as they had done during the last two years.   The goods produoed were being taken off the market.   Demand was keeping fairly well up both for cloth and yarn.   Cotton prices had fallen considerably, and there seemed no reason why they should go up again for the present.   Harm had been done, he thought, by hasty and 111-r.dvised forecasts in the press that ootton would oome down to l/- per pound: this had led merchants to hold off.   Nevertheless prospeots for the next few months seemed brighter than they had been for several yeare past.Mr. JUDSON agreed.   Two months before he had been disposed to take a gloomy view, but the Amerioan ootton crop had now proved to be larger than had been expeoted,
CONFIDENTIAL.TEXTILES (COTTON) (Oontd.).and there were prospects of more work for the operatives. It would, he thought, have beon well if the press had refrained from intervening in the question of wages in the cotton trades both operatives and employers were at liberty to make application for a change if they desired one.SIR EDWIN STOCKTON wrote a -&quot;I am glad to report that the demand for Cotton Textile piece goods is shewing a further inorease since our last month&apos;s meeting, and as the prospects of the American Cotton Crop are of a more favourable nature, I have every reason to believe that the improvement in the Cotton Trade will gradually develop into a satisfactory position. The big eastern Markets which in normal times consume the biggest proportion of our production, are at present undoubtedly rather bare of supplies, and if we oan secure a reasonable oondition of stability in regard to values, I do not hesitate to state that the Lancashire Mills would soon become quite busy.   The outlook 13 certainly much brighter than it has been for some time past&quot;.TEXTILES (WOOL).MR. ANDREWS remarked that a rise of prioes from 10$ to 15$ had&quot; set In In August owing to an anticipated shortage of tho raw material, although this was not yet   very pronounced.With regard to Russia, there had been a good number of enquiries in Bradford from that quarter for scoured wool. Some merchants had effected sales at high prioes and rates of profit, but they were only getting payment in oash to the extent of 30$, the remainder being on a Soviet Government Bill of very doubtful value.   The majority of merchants would not take the risk.There had been a slight improvement in employment of combing machinery; spinning maohinery was not, howeyor, occupied up to more than 60$, which was a very bad average. Competition for the little trade available was so .&apos; keen that spinners wero almost uniformly working at a loss.   Strong competition was being mat with from Franoei Bradford houses found that they oould sell their raw material&apos; to better advantage in France than in England, tho French being in a position to give better prioes, owing to their lower costs of combing and spinning.TEXTILES (WORSTED ETC.).MR. SUTOLIFFS SMITH noted that a reduction of about 700 had taken place In the numbers of unemployed in Bradford.   The French were not taking quite as much of Bradford&apos;a trado as they had dons, and were unable to compete in oloths of better quality than 7/- per yard. Only about 50$ of looms were running, but 60$ of spindles; the lattor representing an increase of some 10$ since when he
CONFIDENTIAL * TEXTILES (WORSTED ETC.) (contd..).last reported.   Some Italian competition was now, however, making itself felt: certain oases had come to his knowledge in which Italian firms had sold large quantities of goods to London houses.The position in India was much better and more hopeful. In China there would be a big trade if only the present politioal disturbances oould be settled, though Italian competition was making itself felt even there&apos;.   Certain figures extracted from the Chinese Customs Returns, however, made disquieting reading: they showed that whereas in 1914 this country had exported some 3,465,000 pieoes of certain cotton piece goods to China as against about 29,000 pieoes from Japan, in 1923, this country exported only some 1,800,000 pieces, as against some 3,000,000 from Japan.With regard to the reported franco-German Commercial Treaty, he wished to associate himself with the cotton trade in emphasizing the necessity of our having an equal chance with France In any trade with Germany.Mr. Alexander in reply referred to the negotiations in progress for an Anglo-German Commercial Treaty: the /President of the Board of&quot; Trade was in consultation with a number of members of the Advisory Council in order that the Board might be kept in touch with the views of the commercial community aa negotiations proceed.Referring to the operation of the forty-eight hours week in Roubaix, whioh had been mentioned at the last meeting, Mr. Sutcliffe Smith said that he had sent out a representative to investigate this question, and hoped to be able to report on it shortly.He wished also to point out that harm was sometimes done to British trade by remarks such as had recently been made publicly in this country in regard to Italian artificial silk, whioh had led every merchant to ask his buyer to pay attention to these Italian goods.   He realised that there was little action that the Government could usefully take, but, in the case he referred to, the industry had already mr.de representations direct, in the quarter. concerned,-&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;GENERAL TRADE -POOD INDUSTRIES.MR&apos;. STANLEY MAORIH said that tho Chambers of Commerce reports did not tend to disclose any general improvement.In the food industry, however, trade was fairly satisfactory in volume.   There was a better demand for eugar products than last year: this had been assisted by the reduction in duty.   The export trade was livelier than it had been for gome years pastj &quot;though there had been a decline in the demand for food products from South America, where, as in so many other manufacturing oountries throughout the world, a tendency to protect home markets by&apos; the imposition of new restrictions was noticeable.He desired to confirm Sir Arthur Balfour!3 remarks as to the Chambers of Commerce view of the proposed Russian Treaty.   While they were in favour of taking any useful
CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE - FOOD INDUSTRIES (Oontd.).steps to encourage trade with Russia, they oould not but regard thi3 Treaty as containing undesirable and dangerous features: a loan under the conditions sug^e^ted would, they considered, be impossible from a business point of view, and much better security would be needed than was now offered.Sir Arthur Balfour said it was felt that all the trade that oould safely be done was being done under the present Trade Agreement.   A high rate was naturally asked for aooeptanoes for any business done with Russia, owing to the laok of security.   Mr. Maohin noted that trade was increasing under the present trade agreement, but it did not appear that the proposed Treaty would make trade any safer.CHEMICALS.MRv PERRY said that the situation of tho chemical Industry, as&apos; shown by the index commodity, sulphuric acid,s showed a marked deterioration: the improvement of which some signs had appeared in the Spring had not been maintained.The industry was conoerned at the polioy and prooedure of the British Dyostuffs Corporation, whioh had been endeavouring to sell sulphuric and nitrio acid In competition, with established British manufacturers in an already overstocked market: at the same time, British colour users said they were unable.to obtain some essential dyes exoept by Importation.The chemical industry also feared that the effect of the Hours of Industrial Employment Bill and the Factories Bill, unless modified, would be to Inorease oosts of production in this oountry and so hamper the export trade.BANKING.MR. TENHANI said that he had no striking new developments to report in the financial world.   No big Empire or foreign Loans had been floated of latei the Bank Rate had remained effeotlve, standing at about Sf since July.With regard to the Australian exchange question, to which previous speakers had referred, he understood that the Sommonwealth Bank had now praotioally been re-organised, but its Board had not yet been appointed.   As soon as this was done, his informant thought it would act by way of issuing money in Australia against securities in this country.   The difficulties whioh had been met with arose from the fact that Australians held their balanoea in this oountry, while money wan needed on the other side.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE wrotes-&quot;Monetary conditions in the month of September were by no moans easy and at times, especially towards the end of the month, accommodation had to be obtained at the Bank of England.   This, of oourae, is not unusual in the last month of the quarter.   Three por oent. has been the general oharge for day-to-day money, and the three months bill rate about 3% - -&quot;-Vie.   In the pant two weeks the
BANKING (Oontd.).Treasury has been able to sell Treasury Bills at a slightly lower rate of diaoount, because the Bills mature in the last days of Deoember when money is usually tight and they are therefore a desirable maturity.   But there is no weakening of the discount market. for three months bills maturing in January the rate is 3/8, at whioh level a paroel of Australian Oommonwealth Bills were plaoed last week.&quot;Deposits have tended to deoline In the past two or three months.&quot;New capital issues are likely to be on a large soale this autumn.   German Loan will be ready for issue probably by the middle of October.   A Greek Loan will follow at no distant date.   Several Corporation issues are contemplated, and Colonial borro\ving will not be inoonspicuous.   The Government also will probably arrange an issue to provide for the maturity next Spring of about  135,000,000 sterling of 5%fo Exchequer Bonds.&quot;American bullishness is mainly responsible for the firmness of the New York exchange, and it is not Improbable that sterling may get back to par next year.   It is reported that the Federal Reserve Banks have deoided not to go on replaoing interest bearing assets with non-interest bearing gold.   In other words, they will force the commercial banks to keep the gold and oreate credit on it, thus protecting the earnings and dividends of the Federal Reserve Banks.   If this deoision is confirmed Amerioan orices should rise and thereby lift up the American exchange.&quot;The prospeots, therefore, are that monetary tendencies will remain firm&quot;.GENERAL TRADE.MR.. BARING remarked that, if exception were made of the coal industry, it seemed to him that the past two months had witnessed a change for the better in the general complexion of the financial and commercial markets.   Commercially, the leading feature was the realization of an abundant crop of ootton in Amerioa, the consequent fall in the price of that commodity, and the prospeot of a revival in the Lancashire textile trade.   Financially, there were two noteworthy events - the expected stabilization of Germany, which seemed likely to give a stimulus to the world*s trade) and the changed attitude of Amerioa towards foreign investments. Last June he had drawn tho Council&apos;s attention to the faot that the American public shewed a marked&apos;disinclination to invest money outside their own.countryj to-day the same public were looking for foreign investments and willing to pay good priooa for them.   This important change of attitude, coupled with the faot that ootton,,whioh Amorioa has to sell, had gone down in price, while wool, whioh she han to buy, had gone up, would tend to have a steadying effeot on the old-world exchanges.Trade in african produce was reported to be in a good position.   Tho South Araeriom ourrenoieo had improved in
CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE (Oontd.)value.    There was a-good demand for oredits, although a-large part of the Amerioan Imports were, naturally enough in view of the low discount rate in New York, financed by dollar oredits.INDIAN TRADE.Mr. LINDSAY said that exports from India had fallen off, though imports remained steady.     The deoline in imports was probably attributable to (l) the seasonal deoline whioh normally began in june (2) more espeoially, to the riBe in the exohange.   City merchants said that any rise in the Rupee exohange above l/5d. brought pressure to bear unfavourable to Indian trade with this country.   It was now at l/5fd.Imports, however, had remained steady at twelve to thirteen million pounds sterling per month for many months past.   There had been a tendenoy during the last two months for the ootton pieoe goods trade to inoreaset this was compensated, however, by a deorease in the imports of sugar. Iron and steel were fairly well maintained.   For the present there seemed no reason why the import trade should be reduoed, as there had been a very satisfactory monsoon.Mr. Andrews enquired whether there was any intention on the part of the Indian Government to alter the duties on ootton in a manner adverse to Lancashire trade.Mr. Lindsay replied.that there was no question of raising the oetton import duty, but a proposal was on foot to abolish the ootton exoise.     A private Bill for this purpose emanating from the swarej party, had passed the Legislative Assembly, but had not yet reoeived the India Government&apos;s-assent, which might be withheld on revenue grounds, sinoe the reoeipts from exoise were considerable, bearing the proportion to revenue from import duties of 5-1$ to 11$.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.Mr. SANDERSON said that he had reoently returned from a five months&apos; visit to Australia, where he had found conditions very favourable.   Wool and wheat were the outstanding faotorB in the situation.   In wool an inorease of prioe of some 10$ to 15$ had taken plaoe, and it was antioipated that there would be an inorease in the year&apos;s output of wool of some three to four hundred thousand bales as compared with the previous year.    He did not think that exohange difficulties had affeoted prioes, so far as could be seen at present.   It was true that in oertain oases wool buyers had been rationed, but there did not seem much likelihood of any serious difficulty in the immediate future.   Rates were oertainly high, but the effeot of this was felt principally by the wool producers, who seemed well able to bear it,   -Efforts were being made to deal with the exchange difficulties by a re-oonstitution of the Commonwealth Bank, whioh it was felt in some quarters had gone rather too far in restricting currency.&apos;   The wheat harvest, of the prospeots of whioh more would be known later, would be a-&apos; factor of importanoe in the -exohange situation! at present indications seemed to point
Af:&apos; &apos;1.... 2&apos;1&apos;   CONFIDENTIAL. AUSTRALIAN TRADE (Oontd.)to the likelihood of a- good one, but much depended on the weather in November.The Canadian-Australian Commercial Agreement called for a mention; under bids,arrangements had been entered into whereby oertain Australian and Canadian goods obtain reciprocal preferences, nctably paper and fish from Canada, and meat and dried fruit from Australia.A further matter   oalling for remark was that the Australian Government had decided to raise the proportion of British labour and materials to be required in British goods under the preferential tariff from 25$ to 75^. A good deal of pressure had been brought upon them to this end and the Tariff Commission was now dealing with the matter.With regard to immigration,numerous sohemes had been put forward and various States had been endeavouring to make arrangements for the last two years to settle Increased numbers, of British immigrants, but It must be admitted that the results so far had been disappointing.    There was no lack of suitable immigrants, but difficulty was found in absorbing and placing them,FAR EASTERN TRADE.-Mr. LANDALE said that before the outbreak of hostilities in China a considerable business was-being done there, but it. was now a-very disturbed market.   Business in Shanghai was muoh affeoted by the fighting,! there were large numbers of refugees in the town, and the oost of living was rising. Two of the railways leading into Shanghai had been badly damaged.The Ohina Association and the British Chamber of   Commerce in Shanghai had telegraphed on 10th September to the Ohina Association in London a resolution passed at a joint meeting, to the effeot that in view of the ohaotio oondition of China, the British Government should be urged to take such steps In conjunction with the leading Powers as would prevent the -continuance of internecine warfare; and suggesting that the state of affairs which had existed in China for several years past, and had resulted in the present upheaval, waB in a measure due to the apathy of the Powers towards misappropriations&quot; by the leading militarists of railway and other State Revenues in part hypothecated to foreign bondholders, as well as to laok of any united action towards preventing illegal exactions.This had been oommunioated to the Foreign Offioe, who however replied that until the hostilities between the Chinese leaders had reaohed Borne deoisive result no peaceful intervention by the Powers oould take plaoe, and no other kind of intervention could be considered.Mr. Landale pointed out that the present oonfusion, if it oontinued, would do great damage to this oountry1s trade.   In this oonneotion It should be borne in mind that something like a quarter of the total population of the world is Chinese.1
*confidential.FAR EASTERN TRADE (Oontd.)He also desired to support Colonel Armstrong^ remarks in regard to the disposal of the Boxer Indemnity.   It seemed desirable that the Committee should contain some representation of industry and should not be bound to devote the fund to any particular purpose suoh as eduoation, without free consideration of other objects.Mr. SUTOLIFFE SMITH enquired as to the present position of the Chinese &apos;Trade&quot;Marks question; he observed that independent   Trade Marka Bureaux had now been set up in Manohuria and in Southern China.     At present British firms were not registering their Marks; the position seemed very oonfused.Sir SYDNEY CHAPMAN replied that the Chinese Government. had made Borne concessions. but not yet on all points.COLONIES &amp;- PROTECTORATES.Sir GILBERT GRINDLE said that there was no substantial change to report in the trade situation of the Colonies and Protectorates, exoept that the rubber position was slightly more satisfactory.RAILWAYS.Mr. BROOKE said that during the last few months railway receipts from merchandise traffio were better, while passenger carryings had oontlnued good; but in spite of this, receipts were down as oompared with the corresponding period of last year; there had been losses of traffic in the ooal trade.00-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (SCOTLAND).Mr. GALLAGHER said that the first three months of the new half year had shown a slight decrease in the business of the Soottish Co-operative Sooieties, especially in the furnishing department.   Groceries, however, showed a slight inorease, attributable entirely to the drop in the price of sugars there had been a fall in the aotual prioe of the article, over and above the reduotion of duty.The general deoline in purohasing power he would attribute to the bad state of the Soottish ooal trade, though it was true that a few signs of revival in this direction had shown themselves during the last few weeks.With regard to the question of the Russian Treaty, the Co-operative Sooieties had considered this question and-while in favour of a trade Treaty, had come to the oonolusion that sufficient information was not yet available as to the Treaty whioh had been signed to enable them to offer an opinion.   They preferred to wait till its scope and detail became more fully known: pending this, he would depreoXate comment whioh    tended to have an adverse effect on its prospeotB-
CONFIDENTIAL. CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (ENGLAND).Mr. ALEXANDER aaid he had reoeived from Sir Thomas Allen, who was unable to be present, reports from the English Co-operative Societies on their business in August and September.
