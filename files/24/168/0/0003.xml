his document is the property of,His&apos; Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ), 403(24).0 R E T.IRISH BOUNDARY COMMISSION.0 A B     HE T.REFERENCE TO THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies.The Chairman Designate of the Commission having anted the question whether a decision by a majority of the Commission will be valid, the question must no doubt be put to the Judicial Committee&apos;, but we are anxious to bring before our colleagues the following considerations:-The political issues raised by this question put it on quite a different footing from the other questions.   The other questions have arisen because of a new circumstance which has occurred since the Treaty was signed, namely,  the refusal of the Ministers of Northern Ireland to advise the Governor as to the appointment of a Commissioner.    But it can be argued with great force that the question of the validity of decisions given by a majority must necessarily have been present to the minds of the framers of the Treaty at the time when Article 12 was agreed to.It is obviously unlikely that any Commission constituted in the manner prescribed by Article 12 and having the task of drawing a new Boundary should be mmnimous in all its decisions. The drawing of a Boundary involves not one decision but numerous decisions as to each of the points through which the line is to run, and it cannot be expected that there should be unanimity with regard to every decision.   This is a consideration arising not as a result of something which has occurred since Article IS was drafted, but inherent in the scheme contemplated by that Article.   If the Boundary Commission must always be unanimous, the whole scheme is unworkable, and the view wi]il be taken in......
the Free State that Article 12 was a mere pretence.   Such a view will be extremely difficult to combat..   It must be remembered, that if the Commission cannot agree as to any particular point in the Boundary line and if a decision by a majority is not valid, there will he no boundary at that point; and if the British Government appears to be in the position of having an open mind on the question whether the Commission can decide by a majority, the inference, we fear, will be inevitable that Article 12 was not honestly intended to provide a solution of the Boundary question.For these reasons it appears to us essential that in putting the question to&apos; the Judicial Committee, it should be made clear that the question has not arisen because of any doubt felt by the Government, but is put at the request of the Chairman designate, and that the legal representatives of the Government should be instructed to defend as the Governments interpretation of the Treaty the view that majority decisions will he valid.In regard to the other questions the task of the legal representatives will be to see that all the considerations are placed before the Judicial Committee, but not necessarily to argue one point of view only.   As regards, however, the question whether decisions can be by majority, it seems to us essential that the legal representatives of the Government should argue as advocates for the only view which is consistent with the good faith of Great Britain as a party to Article 12.We suggest also that when the Free State Government are informed that this question is to be put to the Judicial Committee, it should be made clear to them that the question has been put at the request of the Chairman designate, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government take the view that decisions by a majority will be valid and that this view will be urged by the Government&apos;s legal representatives before the Judicial Committee.
-3-       &apos; r   p  P&quot;&apos;   -If this is not made clear at the outset, the political consequences in tho Free State will, we fear, he of the gravest kind.     Apart from the consideration that the British Government will be exposed to attack for lack of good faith in the framing of the Treaty, there is the further c or: si dor?.-tion that tho Free State   Government will be placed in a most unfair dilemma unless they are told that our legal representa-tives will dofend the view that majority decisions are valid, For political reasons the Free State Government cannot themselves be represented before the Judicial Committee but they will be aware that the case against majority decisions will be fully and.   strongly argued, by the legal representatives of the Northern Government and that unless the opposite vie1&apos;; is   strongly defended,  judgment may go by default.The further question arises what action is to be taken by the Government if the Judicial Committee decide that only unanimous decisions are valid?     The view taken by the Free State will naturally be that this unforeseen defect in Article 12 should be remedied by legislation, and they will urge that if the Government intend to honour the Treaty, as they have always promised, it is their duty to introduce v-: such legislation.     lioreover the fact that there will be no Boundary at any of the points on which the Commission fails to agree, will probably render legislation inevitable in any case.The question /therefore deserves consideration whether we are prepared at once to say something to indicate that if the Judicial Committee should decide that majority decisions are invalid, stops will be taken to remedy the defect.     Such an announcement would be a complete defence - and the only complete defence - against the outcry which the putting of tho question will raise in the Free State.     Wo therefore recommend that in the despatch informing the Free State that this question
July,  1984.is being laid before the Judicial Committee (and&apos; this despatch must be sent not later than Saturday the 19th instant) it should be stated that, while it would be premature to anticipate what the finding of the Committee on this point will be, it would, in the opinion of His I.lajesty&apos;s Government, be incompatible with the honourable observance of the intentions of the Treaty to allow the proceedings of the Commission to be brought to a nullity by reason of such finding.A.H.
