his document, is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos; a Government. ) ISI, CABIN E T.14(84). JInternational Opium Conference, November,  1924.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1,   In November next, in pursuance of a resolution unanimously adopted by the Assembly of the League of Nations at its meeting last September, an International Conference will be held at Geneva, under the auspices of the League, to consider what measures can be taken for giving effect to Chapter II, of the International Opium Convention which provides for the &quot;gradual and effective suppression&quot; of the use of opium for smoking.The Conference v;ill consist of representatives of those States in whope territories the practice of opium smoking still continues/&apos; and of China,Opium smoking is permitted under regulation in several British possessions, more especially in Hong Kong, Straits Settlements and the Malay States, North Borneo, Sarawak&apos;and Burmah, and His Majesty1s Government have accepted the invitation of the Council of the League to be represented at the Conference.   The other States concerned are Prance (in respect of Indo China), the Netherlands (in respect of the Dutch East Indies), Portugal (in respect of Macao), Siam and Japan (in respect of Formosa and the leased territory of Kwantung).The Conference Is the outcome of the proceedings at the meeting of the Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations in April 1923, in which a delegation &apos;from the United States Government took part - and though the United States Government will not be them-aelves represented at the Conference as opium smoking has bean officially prohibited in the Phillippines (their only territories in the Par East) it is known that they take a very lively interest in it?They will be represented at a subsequent and larger Conference which aas also been summoned by the League for November next, to consider the question of the limitation of the manufacture of morphine, nerom and oocaine and the production of raw opium and the coca leaf irpm which the drugs are obtained.
2.   The Opium Advisory Committee at its meeting last yeas-adopted, on the. motion of the British representative, the Resolution of which a copy is annexed.That Resolution embodies certain suggestions, which were put forward after consultation between the Home Office and Colonial Office, as to the measures that might be taken into consideration by the proposed International Conference, for.bringing about the &quot;gradual and effective suppression&quot; of opium, smoking to which the Parties to the Opium Convention are pledged.   This was done in order that all the States concerned might have ample opportunity for examining the suggestions, but neither the British Government nor any other Government was committed by the Resolution to their acceptance.    Some of the suggested measures are already operative in whole or in part in the British Possessions, but the most important from- the point of view of bringing about a gradual reduction in consumption, viz. the proposals for rationing and registration, are not.When the decision to convoke the Conference had been taken by the League, it was decided that the Governments of the Colonies and Protectorates mainly concerned, viz. Hong Kong, The Straits Settlements and Malay States and North Borneo should be asked to appoint Committees, on which the Chinese community should be represented, to consider and report on the suggestions and subject generally.   The reports have now been received, and it becomes necessary for the Government to decide what policy is to be adopted by the British delegates at the Conference next.November.3.   The question is not an easy one.   The present position is far from satisfactory.   To put it shortly, we are not carrying out our obligations under Chapter II of the Convention.   Other countries it is true, are in the same, or even a worse, position.   In all the British Possessions in which opium smoking still continues, elaborate systems of control are in operation.   These have had excellent results up to a point, and brought about a considerable ^eduction in the local consumption.   It is admitted, however, that the systems have produced their full results in this direction and
that no further reduction in consumption is to be expected.    The Government cannot therefore rely on the normal working of these systems of control to bring about the ultimate suppression to which they are pledged by the Opium Convention.The position is complicated further in two ways.   Vv&apos;ith the abolition of the export of opium to China and with tho increasing stringency of the control over the opium traffic in the countries where smoking is still permitted, an enormous smuggling trade has sprung up in the Par East, in which our Possessions are involved to some extent.   Ample supplies for the contraband trade are available from Persia and latterly from China where the cultivation of opium has been revived on an enormous scale.   Many hundreds of tons of opium are again being produced every year in China, and large quantities are being smuggled into neighbouring territories.The Government of Hong Kong estimates that only about half of the opium smoked in the Colony is Government monopoly opium, the other half is smuggled.As long as the sources of supply remain uncontrolled smuggling will continue, however excellent the preventive- services maintained by the Colonies.The relapse of China affects our Colonies in another way. Practically the whole of the opium smoking in British Possessions  -is among the Chinese immigrants, and with the resumption of the practice of opium smoking in China, a much larger number of the Chinese immigrants are bringing the habit with them.   This particularly affects Hong Kong which has a large floating population of Chinese and a very large traffic with the mainland -some ten to twelve thousand Chinese passing daily.   On the other hand, it is interesting to note that in Malaya it appears that the majority of Chinese smokers commenced the habit there.The other complication is that in some of our Possessions the profits of the opium monopoly form an important part of the general revenues of the Colony.   This is particularly;so in the Straits Settlements where the monopoly contributes over 40 per cent of the
revenue.   In the Federated Malay States, the monopoly contributed !?.,&amp; per cent of the revenue in 1932j    in the Unfederated Malay States proportions ranging from 18.5 to 4-0 per cent;    in Hong Kong, about 9,5 per cent.    This would make it    J difficult - apart from other difficulties - to bring about suddenly any drastic change, though it is an unpleasant feature of our position and one which exposes the British Government to    ,iImany attacks in the United States of America and elsewhere.4. There seem to be only two possible methods by which the j suppression of the practice of opium smoking may-be brought about jiOne isflimit the use of opium for smoking to existing smokers by the introduction of a system of regintration or licensing.   Ho licences are issued to hew smokers, and as the existing smokers die off, the practice disappears.   This is the policy adopted by the Japanese Government in Formosa and the Burmese Government in Lower Bu.rm.ah.   The process of reduction can he accelerated by combining with registration a By-stem of      i rationing.The other method is to prohibit absolutely all smoking a.fter a fixed date.   This is the policy adopted by the United States Government in the Philippines.&apos;The first method - that of registration and rationing -was embodied in the suggestions which were put forward in the Resolution of the Advisory Committee of the League and which the Colonial Governments were asked to consider.    The results of their consideration are not encouraging.    The Hong Kong Government declares that in the circumstances of the Colony both registration and rationing are impracticable. It is prepared to adopt the proposal to abolish the private retail shop and to keep the whole of the business in the hands of        Government but it has no constructive proposals of its own to put forward for bringing about the suppression of the practice and takes the view that under present conditions :in. China no reasonable measure can be devised to reduce further
the consumption of opium in Hong Kong.   The Straits Settlements and ,&apos;ialay States while agreeing that &quot;eventual elimination of opium smoking can only he achieved, without causing unnecessary hardship, through control over smokers individually&quot;, considers that the immediate introduction of an individual rationing scheme would be disastrous, and. suggest a scheme for working towards a system of registration and rationing which in the course of Dome years may make its adoption practicable though they are not very sanguine of this.   The scheme includes abolition of private retail shops, alterations in method of packing with a view to checking illicit traffic, reduction in size of packet, appointment of observers at retail shops, and establishment of an Advisory Committee,   north Borneo would agree to some form of rationing hut not registration.5.   It does not seem possible or de inable to force upon the Colonial Governments measures which they believe to be unworkable and for whose administration they,would have to be responsible. This being so, it appears that there are three alternative courses open to the British Government.    They are(i)&apos;Frankly to give up the attempt at gradual suppression of opium smoking in the British Possessions, and to be content with maintaining the present systems of control for what they are .worth with such minor improvements ao are suggested in the reports from the Colonies, on the ground that the relapse of China has entirely altered the position and made it hopeless to attempt to keep the Chinese immigrants from smoking.   This   &apos; course would be extremely difficult to defend.    The obligations undertaken by the Parties to the Convention in Chapter II of the Convention were not made in anyway dependent on simultaneous action by China in the suppression of the growth and use of opium in China, and though the difficulty in the way of enforcing prohibition which is created by the revival of the production and use of opium in China is a very serious one, it is,,difficult to argue that it justifies an abandonment of our pledges.(ii) To proceed with the minor improvements in the existing
systems and at the same time to dissociate the profits of the opium monopolies from the revenues of the Colonies and to use them for humanitarian and social purposes outside the ordinary sphere of Government activities. e.g. medical provision, improvement of housing, higher education, and the like.   This would at any rate relieve us from the reproach of living on the profits of vice.(iii) To announce that prohibition of the use of opium for smoking will he brought into force after a certain fixed period. Different periods could be fixed if desired for different Colonies according to local circumstances.   The Hong Kong Government, if they have to suppress the traffic, would prefer to do it at a stroke.   Their finances are extremely prosperous and the opium revenue is of no consequence to them.   The Malayan Governments which depend very largely on the opium monopoly for their revenue, would need a fairly long period in which to put their finances into order and tap fresh sources of revenue.6.   The Home Office which acts as the central department in regard to matters connected with the International Opium Convention is strongly in favour of the latter course, if it is at all practicable.   Our position at the present time is an equivocal and an embarrassing one.   The British Government has been specially active in the execution of the Opium Convention and has brought a good deal of pressure to hear on other countries to enforce the Convention effectively, while at the same time it has to be admitted that Great Britain itself is not carrying out its obligations under Chapter II of the Convention and moreover is actually deriving large revenues from the traffic which it is under the obligation to suppress.   It is needless to say that in the circumstances we are bitterly attacked in the United States of America and other countries.    The adoption of a policy of definite prohibition after a fixed period: would place Great Britain in a much stronger position internationally and would produce a very good effect   in America which holds very
strong views on the opium traffic.   It would also be welcomed by a large body of opinion in this country.   The League of Nations Union has just declared in favour of prohibiting all exports of opium except for medicinal purposes.It is admitted of course that there will be difficulties in giving effect to the policy of prohibition.   It will be unpopular-no doubt among the large body of smokers, especially in the coolie class;    and the representative of the Straits Settlements and Malay States fears it might lead to actual disturbances.   Ample notice would be given and the Governments could be given a free hand to carry out the change in the way they thought best, provided the Home Government was assured that the Colonial Government was actively preparing for the final step and was in the meantime taking steps to eliminate the opium revenue from its normal budget.It must also be admitted that legal prohibition would not mean the extinction of the practice.   Smuggling will go on, as it goes on in the Philippines today and everywhere else where the opium traffic is controlled, and as long as China grows vast quantities of opium and Turkey and Persia exercise no control over their exports, there will always be an ample supply.   The Colonial Governments would not be asked, however, to do more than they are doing already to prevent smuggling.   Complete prevention is impossible - the admirable preventive service of Hong Kong, even under the present system, cannot prevent huge quantities of opium being smuggled into the Colony.The position would in future, be that opium smoking would be an offence against the law, as it is already in Great Britain and the rest of the Empire, and the authorities would take all the measures in their power to put it down, as for example the authorities are doing here to put it down among the Chinese of Limehou.se or Liverpool.Things at least cannot be worse than they are under the present system, and it is hoped   may be better.   The fact that
the practice of opium smoking is declared illegal will tend to deter decent people, and strengthen the tendency already strong in the younger generation of Chinese in the Colonies against it.The Home Office propose that the adoption of this policy should be urged by the British Delegation at the International Conference in November on all the States represented, but that its adoption by Great Britain should not be dependent on the action of the other Powers and that this should be publicly announced.?.   If the policy of suppression is adopted by the Government it will apparently have certain consequences for the export of opium from India on which the Indian Government should be consulted.All or practically all the opium exported from India   is for smoking and goes to the Par East, partly to our own possessions, partly to the possessions of Prance, Holland, Portugal and Japan, and to Siam.   The revenue derived from this export trade is about  2,000,000 a year, which goes to the Central Government, forming under 2 per cent, of the total revenue.If the policy of suppression is adopted for our own Colonies, it would seem difficult to continue the exports from India to the possessions of other Powers, after the import into our own Colonies has been stopped.   The abandonment of the Indian export trade is being continually urged on Great Britain (especially in U.S.A.). It is justified at present on the ground that Chapter II of the Opium Convention recognises that the suppression of opium smoking can only be effected gradually;    that as long as opium is required and used in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II India may lawfully supply it;    and that as the practice of opium smoking is gradually extinguished the Indian export trade will die a natural death.If, however, the British Government were to adopt a policy of suppression - whether immediate or gradual - for the Colonies, it would not be consistent with that policy for the Indian Government to go on exporting to the possessions of other&apos;j countries after suppression had taken effect in our own.   The
9T9-19.t9- . . i -I &quot;.-       - - -present export may be justifiable if and as long as the importing countries are in fact carrying out the gradual suppression provided for in Chapter II, but if other countries were going to lag behind, and refused to take the steps that the British Government considered necessary for discharging the obligations under Chapter II, the British Government would find it very hard to defend the continued export of opium to such countries.A.

LEAGUE   OF   NATIONS.RESOLUTION PASSED AT FIFTH SESSION OF ADVISORY COMMITTEEOil TRAFFIC IN OPIUM AND OTHER DAHGEROUS DRUGS (MAY 24th TO JUNE 7 th,  1923).The Advisory Committee, having regard to the large amountof detailed information now available, recommends the Council to invite the Powers with Far Eastern territories where the use ofopium for smoking is temporarily continued in.pursuance of chapter II of the Opium Convention, to enter, into immediatenegotiations, by means of calling a special conference ofrepresentatives of these Governments,.or otherwise, to consider what measures could be taken to give a more effective applicationto Chapter II of the Convention and to bring about a reduction ofthe amount of opium used, and whether, on the lines of the suggestions set out below or on other lines, an agreement orunderstanding could not now be reached for the adoption of a uniform policy on the matter;I. That the farm- system, where it is still in operation, should be abolished and that the opium business should be made a Government monopoly and kept entirely in the hands of the Government.II. As a corollary of paragraph I, that the retail sale of prepared opium should, be made only from Government shops, and that all private shops should be abolished.   Persons in charge of Government shops should be paid&apos;a fixed salary without any commission on the amount of business done, and therefore would have no temptation to push the sales.III. That a uniform maximum limit should be fixed for theamount of prepared-opium placed on sale for consumption, calculated according, to the number of the adult Chinese male population, e.g., x taels per 10,000 adult Chinese males in the territory, and that the annual imports ofraw opium should be limited to the amount required for that rate of consumption-.IV. That the possibilities of the system of registration and-licencing, which has already been introduced in come of the Far Eastern territories, should be thoroughly explored.V. That the possibility should be considered of making uniform so far as circumstances permit: W(a) the price at which prepared opium in retailed in thedifferent territories, and(b) the penalties for infraction of the law in regard tothe import, export, sale and use of prepared opium.
rVI. That the interested Powers, that is, the Powers having territories in the Par East where the consumption of prepared opium is still permitted, should conclude an agreement among themselves to apply the foregoing measures for the purpose of carrying out Chapter II of the Convention.VII. That the position should he generally reviewed periodically by the Powers interested and the question of further , reducing the maximum limit fixed in the agreement should be&apos;considered. N
