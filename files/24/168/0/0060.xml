[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)[Printed for the Cabinet.      September 1924.)SECRET.CP. 458 (24). 1 ,.Situation in Bengal. f;     n qI circulate for the information of my colleagues copy of a Memorandum which I have received from Lord Lytton on the political situation in Bengal as it emerged from the Legislative Council after the vote of 26th August; rejecting the provision for salaries for Ministers.Lord Lytton in his covering letter remarks: &quot;Although I have attempted to estimate the relative strength of the various parties, this is a much more difficult matter than it would be in England, as party ties are less binding in this country, and there are practically no party organisations in the constituencies. I have, therefore, based my classification chiefly upon the votes which the new members have recorded in the first two sessions of the new Council.&quot;30th September 1924. OLIVIER.Memorandum by the Goveknou of Bengal.Owing to the refusal of the Legislative Council to vote any salaries for Ministers, the Reforms have been suspended in Bengal for the time being. I have taken over charge of the Transferred Departments under the Transferred Subjects (Temporary Administration) Rules and prorogued the Legislative Council.The existence of this emergency and its probable duration can best be explained by an analysis of the composition of the various groups in the Legislative Council and the motives which have influenced them to produce this result. There are 140 members of the Council. Of these 114 are elected and 26 are ex officio or nominated. Of the elected members the largest group consists of the Swarajists under the ^6 Swav: leadership of C. R. Das. This is a compact, well disciplined, well-organised body, jists. with an acknowledged leader, a well defined programme and a well filled party chest. When the new Council assembled in January last the Swarajists numbered 46, consisting of 24 Hindus and 22 Muhammaclans. Since then, however, bye-elections have added two more Hindus and deprived them of one Muhammadan. The 26 Hindus are as staunch as ever in their allegiance to the party, but of the Muhammadans five have either voted with the Government on certain occasions or have definitely severed their connection with the party. The reliable strength of the party at the present time is therefore 42.The Swarajya party represents the wing of the non-co-operation party which broke away from Gandhi on the question of Council entry.   Its members are bitterly anti-British and belong to the extreme left or ultra-nationalist group in Indian politics. Their Their object is to force the concession of political independence and full responsible object, government on a representative basis by making every other form of government impossible.   The methods they adopt for this purpose are--(1) To utilise every possible occasion of making Government hated, and by Their deliberate falsehoods, distorted facts, insinuations, misrepresentation of methods, opinions and a continual stream of abuse of every Government official from the Governor clown to the village chaukiclar, to stir up hostility against what they call &quot;the alien bureaucracy.&quot; For this purpose their official organ The&apos; Forward a most excellent newspaper, well printed, well edited and cleverly written is their most effective weapon.(2) To capture as many seats as possible in the Legislative Council and local governing bodies with the object of obstructing Government ou every possible opportunity. Their candidates are mostly of a very indifferent standard of intelligence or character. It is sufficient that a man should be extremist in opinion and obedient to the party orders for him to be selected to contest a seat, and his election is facilitated by the intimidation of his*    opponents.(3) To obtain large party funds, partly by appeals to nationalist supporters, partly by blackmail, partly by patronage. Two very profitable sources of income have been exploited during the present year; one is the patronage which they enjoy through their majority on the Calcutta Corporation, atad the other is the agitation which they engineered against the Mohunt of the 7687     100  10.2-1 A
Tarkeswar Shrine: This agitation, which professed to be a religious move-ment, aimed solely at the purification of the worship in a Hindu temple, has been a very valuable piece of political propaganda. Having exposed the iniquities of the Mohunt, it was a comparatively easy task to represent Government as his protectors and as the opponents of a movement for the reform of the worship in a Hindu temple. Having then secured the inter-vention of Congress a purely political body the Swarajists have been able to use.this agitation to fan the flame of anti-government prejudice, to fill the jails with emotional and ignorant young men, to capture the temple and take all the fees from the pilgrims, and now they appear to be on the point of extorting a handsome fine from the Mohunt as the price of a settlement of the question with him.In the Legislative Council the Swarajists have had hut one policy, namely, to obstruct the Government in everything and thereby to &quot;destroy diarchy.&quot; In this, although they do not command a majority, they have at last succeeded for reasons which will be apparent when the composition of the other groups comes to be considered. The Swarajist members were the only ones who voted for the rejection of Ministers&apos; salaries with the object of &apos;.&apos; destroying diarchy,&quot; and they are the only ones, therefore, that are completely satisfied with the result. They are confident that the Government at home will now come forward with fresh concessions to secure their co-operation. If they knew that no further concessions would be made, and that the result of their action would be not more, but less self-government, they would be as little satisfied as anyone else.Merits and The merits and demerits of this party may be summed up as follows i-They are demerits of the only-Indian party in Bengal with an efficient organisation, au accepted leader, a this party, considerable fund for party propaganda, a party newspaper, a common policy and a certain amount of party discipline. All these are great merits, rare in Indian politics and reflecting great credit upon their leader, C. R. Das, who has brought his party to such a degree of efficiency. The greatest defect in the party is its want of any constructive policy. Its methods are purely destructive and it has not yet therefore had any opportunity of testing its strength in a position of responsibility. They were given such an opportunity alter the last general election and had they then accepted the responsibility of office, they would have been able to prove how far they could retain the majority with which they were provided at the elections once the responsi-bility for carrying on the administration rested upou them. Another grave fault of the party has been the use which it has made of its party funds. Bribery, blackmail and intimidation have succeeded in their immediate object, but they have lost the party the respect of their countrymen. The Swarajists are feared but disliked and 27m; Forward is now the only newspaper in which C. R. Das is not criticised daily. The last fault of this party, and perhaps the most serious of all, is the connection which some of its leaders have allowed themselves to establish with the physical force or revolutionary party. When C. II. Das first established the Sivaiajya party, he imposed upon his followers the obligation of abstaining from violence with as much emphasis as Gandhi had done before him. But as he had neither tho sincerity nor the strength of character of Gandhi, he was unable to resist the pressure which was immediately put upon him by the party of violence ; and little by little he has allowed himself to be completely captured by them. The first step in his surrender was when under threats from the revolutionaries he made the release of the Regulation III prisoners the first item in his party programme at the beginning of the session of the new Council in January 1924. This was an easy step to take because it was consistent with his own political principles, and was supported by many members of other political parties. The difference, however, between C. R. l)as&apos;s advocacy of the resolution for the release of these men, and that, of others who supported it, was that the latter did not believe hi the existence of a revolutionary conspiracy, whereas he was fully aware of it, and had even been threatened with the hostility of its members if he did not support them. Tho second step which bound him irrevocably to the revolutionary movement was the support which was extorted from him to the resolution extolling the patriotism of Gqpinath Saha (the murderer of Mr. Day) at the Serajgnnge conference in June. On this occasion, as the price of their support, the revolutionaries not only insisted on the passing of this resolution, but also demanded and received substantial financial assistance from the Swarajya party. As their demands were accepted Surendra Ghosh, who had conducted the negotiations ou behalf of the revolutionaries, brought
90 ft9 O c oo500 of his : followers from Mymensingh to support C. R. Das throughout the Conference. From this time onwards 0. R. Das has been obliged to admit himself -that the fortunes of the. Swarajya and revolutionary parties were inseparably interwoven, and though in the statement of the objects of the party the words &quot;the attainment of Swaraj by all legitimate and peaceful means &quot; are retained in spite of the efforts of the extremists to get rid of them, they have ceased to have any practical effect.The second largest group among the elected members of the Legislative Council Co&quot;8&apos;i&apos; is composed of Moderates or Constitutionalists. In the last Council this group had a utl0naIlsts substantial majority and were beginning to be organised into a party under the leadership of S. Li. Das (the Advocate General). At tho General Election at the end of 1923, however, they were completely defeated and their organisation has since broken up into a number of scattered groups with little or no cohesion. In the present Council this party, if such it can be called, numbers 29 including certain Muhammadan members who were returned as Swarajists or Independents, but the. various members who make up this number have no common leader, no common policy, no party discipline, and it cannot be calculated with any certainty how their votes will be cast in any particular division. They may be divided into four separate groups. The first is that. of the elected Europeans, who number .18 and who consistently support the Government on all occasions. The second is that of the Muhammadans, who also number 18 and who have consistently supported the two Muhammadan Ministers in the present Council. The third is that of the Hindus, who only number seven.and whose allegiance to Government has been severely strained by the absence of any Hindu Minister. The last group consists of a few individuals whose action has been dictated solely by personal considerations, and who, though opposed to the Swrarajists in principle, have occasionally voted with them for one reason or another.Each of these groups may now be.considered separately.(1) The Europeans. This group is the only one, except the Swarajists, which can be said to possess all the characteristics of a genuine political party. They have a common policy, a common leader, a party whip, and in The Englishman and The Statesman they have in effect a party Press. It is always possible, through their leaders or their whip, to ascertain what the attitude of this group will be on any particular question, and, having decided their policy at a party meeting, every member of the party may be relied on to vote in accordance with that decision. They number 18, and have consistently supported the Government in the present Council.(2) The Muhammadans. Out of 40 Muharnmadan seats in the Council, two are Ministers, and 13 others are consistent supporters of the Government, while five others have supported Government on certain occasions. These men have no separate organisation apart from the various Muhammadan bodies of which they are members. They have no recognised leader, though in the present Council they have accepted the leadership of the two Muhammadan Ministers, and Mr. Ferroqui as their party whip. On all communal questions they are united in the defence of what they consider to be Muhammadan interests, and they exercise as much pressure as they can upon the Ministers to secure the appointment of a Muhammadan to any vacant post in the Government service, quite regardless of whether or not a suitable candidate may be available. In national politics they are suspicious of any rapid advance towards Swaraj, which they fear is likely,, if attained in the near future, to be a Hindu raj under which they would fare worse than under the present regime. In local politics they are inclined to be liberal; they support the Government in all transferred subjects, but are apt to be critical of it in regard to reserved subjects. Their support could be counted on by any Ministry which either included two Muhammadau members or at least one member in whom they had confidence, and to whom they could look for the protection of Muhammadan interests.(3) The Hindus. The Hindu Moderates or Constitutionalists only number seven altogether, and of these two of them, namely, Sir P. C. Mitter and Raja Rishi Case Law voted with the Swarajists against the late Ministers. They are a mere rump of the Constitutional party of S. R, Das, which was so strong in the last Council. They would all favour a Ministry with two Hindu members, but it is doubtful if even these seven could agree upon who the two Ministers should be. So long as the Ministry was composed of two Muhammadans only, they wrere at best very lukewarm m their support, and their votes could never be counted on. !:&apos;V::&apos;   &quot; v&apos;.;:&apos; &apos; :: :&apos;&apos;&apos;K^r:&apos;J
C (4) Miscellaneous. Lastly, there is a group of 11 men whonv it is difficult to-classify at present.   They are:-     &apos;(1) Major Hassan Suhrawardy, the Deputy President of. the Council. He is a Muhammadan of a moderate school, both on communal questions as well as in general politics. He described himself as an Independent when the Council first met iu January, but the qnly two votes which he has recorded have been in favour of Government. His attendance is necessarily irregular owing to the fact that he is a medical officer in the employment of the East Indian Railway and is now stationed at Tundla in the Punjab. It is therefore extremely difficult lor him to attend, and, as Deputy.President, he does not consider it advisable to vote except on very important, issues. He might, I think, be classified as a Moderate, but his attendance cannot be depended on.(2) Rai Sahib Panchanan Barma. This man alsO&apos; classified himself as an Independent and voted against Government in most of the divisions during the last session. He has, however, recently supported the Government and may now be classified as. one of the Moderate group.. (3) Brajendra Kishore Boy Ghaudhury. This gentleman is classified as a Moderate, but he was absent through illness most of the first session and has never yet recorded a vote in the Council. On the occasion of the vote on the Ministers&apos; salaries he was besieged all day in his house by a crowd that refused to let him leave and he declined the offer of a police escort!(4) Maulvi AUabaksh Sarkar was returned as a Swarajist but he has voted with the Government on every issue except that of the Ministers&apos; salaries, when ou the first occasion he abstained (it is alleged after receipt of Rs. 3,000 from the Swarajists); and on the second occasion he voted against Government.(5) Maulvi Muhammadan Abdul Jubbar Pahlowan. This gentleman is somewhat of a freak. He entered the Council as a Swarajist and voted with that party in all the early divisions. He is said to have received commissions from the Swarajists to influence members of the Government party to abstain or vote against their party. It was he who offered Rs. 3,000 to Haji Lai Mahammed to abstain from voting in the first division on Ministers&apos; salaries and afterwards (it is believed) got Allabaksh Sarkar to accept this amount. The Ministers then brought pressure to bear upon him through his father, and he came over to their side. He distinguished himself by breaking up one of C. R. Das&apos;s meetings by turning out all the lights, and on the strength of this &quot;service&quot; asked to be made a Minister. In the last session after much negotiation with the Swarajists and after receiving promises of rewards from them which were not paid, he voted with the Ministers and was reprimanded by the President for trying to drag members by force into the lobby with him.(6) Maulvi Tayebaddin Ahmed. He entered the Council as a Swarajist and voted with his party in the early divisions. In the Budget debates, however, he voted with the Ministers on the demands for the transferred subjects and he voted with them in both divisions on their salaries.(7) Maulvi Sultan All, also a Mnhammadan Swarajist who only once voted with Government in the first session, but who supported the Ministers in the division on their salaries on 26th August.(8) Maulvi Zanoor Ahmed, a Muhammadan Independent who supported the Ministers on the demands for transferred subjects. He voted with them on the demand for their salaries on 24th March, but against them on the same issue on 26th August.(9) Mr. Altaf Ali (son of the Nawab Ali Chaudhuri Bahadur), who, though returned as a Swarajist, generally voted with Government. He abstained on 24th March and voted against the Ministers on 26th August.(10) Maharaj Kumar Sris Chandra Handy (son of the Maharaja of Cosimbasar), a Hindu Moderate, who also abstained on 24th March and voted against the Ministers on 26th August.(ID Debendra Lai Khan (son of the late Raja Narendra Lai Khan of Narajole), a Hindu Moderate, who, however, divides his votes almost equally between the Government and the Opposition.   His motives are unfathomable, but he is evidently influenced by personal considerations. The Inde-       ,;: The third main group in the Legislative Council is that which contains the men pendent or who have called themselves Independent.   For the most part this group consists of Party&quot;1 ,S   individuals who owe allegiance to no one, who would accept office themselves, but
who would support no one else in office. They attend the meetings of the Swarajya party and have voted with the Swarajists on all occasions, the only difference between the two being apparently that the Independents are prepared to accept office and the Swarajists are not. The nominal leader of this party, which consists of 19 Hindus and 6 Muhammadans, is Byomkes Chakravarti, but it is doubtful how many of these would support him if he took office.When the new Council met after the general election I had to consider whether or not to retain my existing Ministers, and if not, whom to appoint in their places. Three facts appeared to emerge from the election: (1) That the Constitutional party to which the Ministers belonged had been decisively defeated ;(2) That no single party had a majority against a combination of the other two ; (3) That the Swarajists comprised the largest group among the elected members,and if they combined with the Independents they would have a decisivemajority.In view of these facts, I accepted the resignation of my Ministers, and sent for Mr. C. R. Das, the leader of the Swarajya party. I offered him the opportunity of becoming a Minister himself, and of suggesting to me the names of his colleagues, but after thinking the matter over he declined. I then sent for Mr. Byomkesh Chakravarti and made him the same offer. Mr. Chakravarti expressed his willingness to take office, but asked for time to consult his followers. In a subsequent interview lie agreed to form a Ministry, and submitted to me his conditions. These conditions I was unable to accept and the negotiations fell through. As my refusal to appoint Mr. Chakravarti as Minister has sometimes been criticised, it may be as well to explain my reasous. The independent Nationalists who accepted Mr. Chakravarti&apos;s leadership only numbered about 25. It was obvious that he could not retain office without the support of one of the other two groups, and it was necessary for me to know on which of the two he intended to rely. I put this question to Mr. Chakravarti and he told me that he would have to rely ou the support of the Swarajists. Such a situation would have meant that the policy of the Ministers would be dictated by a party who had themselves refused the responsibility of office on the ground that they were pledged to alter the Constitution not to work it. I told Mr. Chakravarti that I was quite prepared to allow the Swarajists to put their policy into operation if they accepted respon-sibility for the consequences, but I was not prepared to allow them to dictate the policy -of Government without such responsibility.- He replied that he had &apos;no intention of allowing his policy to be dictated by the Swarajists and that if they voted against him, he would rely on the support of the Moderates or Constitutionalists. I then pointed -out to him that if he intended to rely on the votes of the Constitutionalists to save him from Swarajist dictation, that party was entitled to some representation in his Ministry, and I asked him if he would select one Constitutionalist as his colleague. This he refused to do, and I told him that in that case I should be obliged, before appointing him, to try and secure a Ministry which would command a majority from :among the Constitutionalists. He replied that in his opinion I should find this impossible, and the interview terminated.I was now left with the task of forming a Ministry with the knowledge that it would encounter the combined opposition of the Swarajists and Independents, whose total strength would number about 68. If the new Ministers could secure the support, -of the remaining elected members, they would with the official and nominated, members number 72 and thus secure a bare majority. I considered that in view of the defeat of the party of the late Ministers in the elections new men would have the best chance of rallying all the Moderates in the Council, and perhaps detaching a few &apos;of the Independents. I therefore sent for Mr. S. N. Mallik, who had been the virtual, leader of the opposition in the late Council. He not only consented to accept office himself, but he admitted&apos; that as the majority of his followers would necessarily be Muhammadaus, his two colleagues should be Muhammadans. On his advice I selected Mr. Fazl-ul-Haq as the second Minister, and with their joint approval I offered the fhird post to Mr. Ghuznavi.The new Ministry was unfortunate from the outset. Mr. Mallik was unseated by ;an election petition and the two Muhammadan Ministers were left to bear the brunt of the first session without the assistance of a Hindu colleague. It. is unnecessary to recapitulate the story of the two sessions of the Council which took place this .year, but it should be remembered that in spite of the narrow margin of their anajority never more than one or two votes the two Ministers were able to defeat
the determination of the Swarajists to throw out the entire budget, and when ther xesigned at the end of August they could point to the fact that all the demands for the transferred subjects had been passed intact.The possibility of the formation of a new Ministry has now to be considered. The first important consideration is that out of 140 members, only 42 are actually in favour of suspending the Constitution and desired to make the appointment of any Ministers impossible. It may be assumed that in spite of the voting on 26th August, the 25 Independents, the 29 Constitutionalists, the 18 elected Europeans and the 9 nominated non-officials, are all in favour of retaining Ministers though they are unable to agree, upon the individuals whom they would support. The formation of a new Ministry from among., the Constitutionalists alone is clearly impossible. Against the combined opposition of. the Swarajists and Nationalists, the Government majority has been shown by experience to be too narrow even if all its supporters were united, whilst the action, of Sir P. 0. Mitter and Raja Rishi Case Law in voting with the Swarajists against the late Ministers, and of the Nawab Ali Chaudhuri Bahadur in abstaining, has destroyed any chance of unity within that party. Feeling at the moment runs very high between the Hindu and Muhammadan sections of the Constitutionalists, and the-Europeans, who did their utmost to save the Constitution, do not conceal their satisfaction that it has been destroyed by the treachery of two ex-Ministers. A new Ministry formed by a combination of Swarajists and Independents is equally -impossible. Not only are the objections to such a combination as strong as they were in December hist, but the jubilations of the Swarajists over the death of Diarchy would make it impossible for them to assist in its resuscitation. The only chance of a new Ministry, therefore, depends upon some combination between the Independents, and the Constitutionalists.The difficulties in the way of such a combination are great but not insuperable. In the first place the politics of the Nationalists are iu all essentials the same as those of the Swarajists, the.only difference between them being.the willingness of the-former and the unwillingness of the latter to take office. It would not, therefore, be easvfor the Nationalists and the Constitutionalists to work together. Secondly, the Nationalists are practically entirely a Hindu party, and it is very doubtful whether the Muhammadans, who are naturally resentful at the attitude of the Hindus towards their Ministers, would consent at this moment to support a Ohakravarti Ministry. They are more likely to combine with the. Swarajists to defeat such a Ministry. Thirdly, the Europeans are not likely to give any support to Ministers who throughout the last two sessions have voted with the Swarajists ou every single issue and whose speeches have been as bitterly anti-British and anti-Government as those of any Swarajist. These 18 votes, therefore, could not be counted on in any combination between Nationalists and Constitutionalists. Without the 18 Europeans and the 10-Muhammadans, Mr. Chakravarti would be placed in the following position. In the-most favourable circumstances he might receive the support of Hindu Nationalists, 19 ; Hindu Constitutionalists, 11; Nominated non-officials, 9 ; Official block, 17; Nationalist Muhammadans, 8. Total, 64. This would enable him to defeat a Swarajist opposition of 42. The European and Muhammadan groups,, numbering 34, would be a neutral body holding the balance. If at any time they combined with the Swarajists they could put the Government in a minority. On any . issues, however, on which the Ministers were likely to be supported by the Swarajists-they would probably find themselves opposed by the combined votes of the official block, the European members, the Muhammadan group and a certain number at, least of the Hindu Constitutionalists. This opposition might number from 50 to 60 against, a Swarajist-Independent combination of 65 to 70.It would, therefore, be possible for ,a Ghakravarti Ministry to be formed and to-carry on the Government if an agreement could be arrived at between his party and a -Substantial number of&apos;the Constitutionalists. Such an agreement, however, is more likely to come about after the consequences of disagreement have been demonstrated,, and a certain period without any Ministers at all has elapsed. I do not propose, therefore, to take any step at the present time towards the formation of a new Ministry, and I shall await the results of negotiation between the various leaders.31st August 1924.
