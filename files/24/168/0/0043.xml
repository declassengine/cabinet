[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.  August 1924,CONFIDENTIAL&quot;...CP. 441 (24).[C 12732/903/18]THE Prime Minister wishes to communicate in great confidence to the members of the Cabinet a letter which he has addressed to the Prime Ministers of France and of Belgium. The Cabinet would like, he thinks, to have this letter for its information so as to protect it against believing some untrue and unfair statements that are being made in certain sections of the press. 1 : &quot; -August 9,, 1924.Mr. MacDonald to M. Herriot and M. Theunis.August 9, 1924.I HAVE been sounding opinion amongst my supporters and in the House of Commons regarding two matters that have given me some anxiety in connection with our present negotiations the continued presence of railwaymen in the occupied area of the Rhineland, and the military evacuation of the Ruhr.As regards the first, I have consulted railway experts who are in charge of railway staffs and responsible for practical railway administration. They all tell me that if they were responsible for the administration of railways in the Rhineland and 4,000 French and Belgian railwaymen were pushed into the working staffs without the consent of the other-workmen, they would not undertake to manage the railways. Under those circumstances they would anticipate nothing but disorganisation-tion and trouble. They also pointed out that the presence of those men, in consequence of the edicts of an outside authority, would, however dicreetly the situation might be handled, as a matter of fact introduce a double authority, because it could never be felt either by those responsible for the foreign staffs or by those responsible for the German one that German railway authority was indeed supreme. I have therefore been advised with the most absolute emphasis that 4,300 French and Belgian railway workers in the Rhineland railways.would destroy harmonious and unified working.On the political side I find a corresponding stiffness. There is an almost universal feeling amongst members of the House of Commons that for over a year a looseness of mind has been creeping into the Allied administration of the Treaty of Versailles, and I must confess that my own experience at the Foreign Office has greatly disturbed me in this respect. A feeling has grown up that if the treaty does not suit us on this point or on that we need not observe it. i must firmly decline to take the view that when the treaty is not convenient for us we can break it, and at the same time make representations to Germany that she must fulfil her obligations down to the very last letter.The same kind of consideration, I find, has given rise to tremendous fears regarding the occupation of the Ruhr. Some of the Members of Parliament who are most bitter in their attitude to Germany, and who have consequently welcomed with hearty gratitude the attempts I have made to make the Entente a real living thing, are most disturbed at the attitude of some French sections who say that, having gone into the Ruhr for one reason, they may stay in it to suit their convenience in other directions. I have already put up this case in conversation with General Nollet in particular, but I feel it my duty to record it in writing, so that my position will admit of iw questioning in future. France sent soldiers into the Ruhr in consequence of a decision passed by a majority of the Reparation Commission that Germany was guilty of a default, and that the Allied Governments were therefore free to take sanctions. The British Government disagreed with the interpretation of the treaty which the French and Belgian Governments accepted, but I waive that consideration, for the moment,  France and Belgium undertook a military occupation of the Ruhr,2353   [11961]
in order: to support&apos;economic and industrial staffs of engineers, workmen of various kinds, and so on, who might be supposed to require police protection, which could only be given by soldiers. Now, when we are doing our best to liquidate the past, 1 have been faced with the argument that, as Germany has not fulfilled her obligations under the treaty; and as to hand back the Ruhr to Germany might mean that if it was evilly disposed it would thereby be in a better position for aggressive action, therefore France has the right to transform its military occupation from a police occupation to one of extra military security. Against that the British Government must firmly protest. When the Treaty of Versailles was under discussion the question of German disarmament, security and everything else relating to the relative position of France and Germany in consequence of all possibilities contained in the position left at the end of the war was thoroughly discussed at the Peace Conference, and the Allies agreed to certain provisions/which were accepted by France and Belgium, embodied in the treaty and presented as an ultimatum to Germany. If the Allies as a unified whole, or if any one of them or group of them, were now to say that action not provided for in the treaty, but expressly excluded by the limitations of the treaty, can be justified because it suits their convenience or because it may help to allay their fears, they would deal a most damaging blow to the moral confidence which the world reposes in them. Apart from all this, the technical necessities of the case would compel us to have a new conference, not only with Germany, but with every signatory of the Treaty of Versailles, before we could vary its terms and add to the obligations contained in it.When the question was raised as to whether this last point is really involved in the discussion of the obligations imposed upon us by the Dawes Report, I hope my colleagues will recognise that I have been willing to take up an attitude of a. helpful kind. This is the situation as I see it. The Dawes Report makes nq, recommendation regarding, military occupation because the experts were not allowed, to&apos; do so in view of their limited terms of reference; but they give the Governments a warning that economic unity cannot be dissociated from military occupation. What the experts say in effect is : &quot; We cannot express military views, but we hand over to the Governments the problem that the military occupation gives to them to solve if they mean to carry our report into effect. Though we ourselves cannot discuss it, you must, because it cannot be dissociated from the economic unity upon which you asked us to report.&quot; I have, therefore, favoured a discussion of this, not in the conference, but between the representatives of the Governments themselves as a diplomatic consequence of the Dawes Report. I have even gone a little further thau that and have said that, as the British Government has never recognised the legality of the Ruhr occupation, its correct attitude ought to be that it takes no part in the&apos; negotiations for the liquidation of the occupation.. I have been willing that the French and Belgian Governments, acting themselves, should come to their owu decisions upon it, and that only when they have arrived at conclusions they should communicate them to me. Of course, if these conclusions seem to me either to violate the Dawes plan or to be contrary to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, I retain the right to object. But if I do not regard them in that way, I should be willing that our two Allies should set about carrying their conclusions into effect. In any event, it is quite impossible for me to recognise an occupation which His Majesty&apos;s Government have never recognised by accepting the suggestion that I should bargain it off by, or in any way mix it up with, our continued occupation of Cologne for reasons not provided for in the treaty.The various problems and diplomacies which arise out of this situation 1 will always approach and handle with a most sympathetic desire to make ways smooth and co-operation easy. But I am very anxious that no misunderstanding should be entertained regarding the position of the Government.I am, &amp;c.J. RAMSAY MacDONALD.
