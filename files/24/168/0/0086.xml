fflSJjOOIMMT IS Tim P IDPE RTY OF II IS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot; S gpTOMMT).1,     I desire to call the attention of the Gabinet to the  1 urgent necessity of dealing with the question of the Sugar Beot industry.So     The late Chancellor of tho Exchequer announced in the House of Commons on tho 50th July last that the Government had decided to recommend Parliament to give a subsidy for a period of ten years on a diminishing scale to sugar manufactured in this country from home grown beet.   It was the intention to introduce the necessary legislation in tho Autumn Session so that the subsidy should be payable in respect of sugar manufactured this winter.3.     During the recent Election the Prime Minister pledged the Conservative Party to give particular consideration to the further development of the Sugar Beet industry, and I recommend that we should adopt and carry out the proposals of the late Government, which wore worked out in detail by a Departmental Committee re-presenting the Treasury, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Scottish Office and have been accepted and approved by all sections of the industry,,4,     On the assumption that these proposals would be carried out this year arrangements were being made for the immediate erection of six ne?/ Sugar Factories.   But tho delay and uncertainty of the position is impeding the provision of the necessary capital, and farmers are naturally reluctant to enter (into definite contracts to grow beot for a period of years until the subsidy proposals have received/S S C 3 BJP.CP, 483(24),CABINS I.SUGAi?

statutory authority.   There ia, therefore, a serious clanger that several of the proposed new Factories will not he put in hand in time to begin manufacturing sugar next Autumn and if so a further year will be lost.5o     I hope, therefore, that the Cabinet will agree that the necessary legislation should be introduced and passed into law before Christmas.   If it is deferred till next year It will probably not bocorae law until some time after the close of the sugar manufacturing season and the consequent delay in the payment of the subsidy will seriously embarrass the three existing Factories.60     If the legislation is introduced at once I do not anticipate any material opposition in Parliament, but any delay will certainly give rise to demands for a revision of the scheme and an extension of the period of the subsidy?7,     The legislation required consists of a short Bill, a Vfeys and Means Resolution for the imposition of an Excise Duty and a Supplementary Estimate for the amount of the subsidy in respect of sugar manufactured this winter., -8.     I ask, therefore, for the authority of the Cabinet to arrange with the -Vhips that the necessary legislation should be introduced and passed! into law before Christinas,,(Xntldo)   EoFbBoni stry of Agriculture and Fisheries 11th November. 1924u
