THIS DOCUMENT IN THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,I oiroulate for the information of the Cabinet a Summary of the views expressed by the members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council at the meeting on the 12th November.It will be seen that on the whole the outlook is brighter than it was some months ago.   The most marked improvement is in the cotton trade.   This should both increase the volume of our exports, and re-act favourably through increased purchasing power on the home market. The more gloomy aspect of the position is to be found in the reports on coal, shipbuilding, general engineering and iron and steel.   The most serious feature as regards the last-named is the low level of prices rather than the volume of production,I also attach certain statistical tabl es, which are I think of value as showing the volume, character and distribution of our export and import trade as compared with pre-war.SECRET,C A B I N E T..P. 500 (24).TRADE OUTLOOK.(Intd.)

TRADE OUTLOOK.ENGINEERING - GENERAL TRADE.SIR ARTHUR BALFQUR said that in the Sheffield engineering and shipbuiiding &quot;tiool&apos; trades, a great laok of oonfidenoe had been feit up to a short time ago.   The United States market was almost closed to them, on account of the tariff, while trade with Franoe was very difficult owing both to the tariff and to the state of the exchange: in faot, many firms had now reaohed the point where they would have to deoide whether to oarry on with that trade or not.   On a reoent visit to Franoe, he had found that the French appeared nervous as to their own ourronoy, and there seemed to be some danger of another &quot;flight from the frano&quot;.   The proposal of a loan to Russia, finally, had been unfavourably received by the oommeroial oommunity in this country.Recently, however, there had been a marked improvement iii confidence: an impetus had been given to enquiries and even to aotual buying.   The home trado had been very much better during the last two or three weeks: the number of unemployed had aotually declined and longer hours were being worked. Trade with Japan, however, remained very bad: that oountry was overstocked, and imports were being ourtailed in oonsequenoe.   The Chinese trade, on the other hand, was better and payments were being made satiBfaotorily.   Trade with the Empire, especially with Australia, remained good, though that with Canada had fallen off slightly.There seemed a prospect that a fair number of unemployed oould be absorbed in Sheffield in the near future. Even the trade in the heavy steel of Sheffield (as distinct from the different quality of heavy steel produced on the North East coast) was feeling the improved conditions.   This trade had, howevor,   boen oarried on with very narrow margins of profit. There now seemed some prospeot of prioes rising.Replying to a question of the President^, Sir Arthur Balfour said that the competition which was most keenly felt in the engineering tool trade oamo from our own firms, and not from Germany or the United States.COLONEL ARMSTRONG   said that the general feeling disclosed by the reports reooived by the Fedoration of British Industries was that conditions generally were improving.   There was a greater feoling of oonfidenoe, not unassoeiated probably with the change of Government. There seemed to be a general increase in purchasing power, and the exohange situation was more favourable to us.   Traders, however, felt some apprehension that the seasonal demand for money might lead to a rise in the bank rate.In general engineering, apart from electrioal engineering, conditions oontinued vory bad.   But the engineering trade was usually the last to feel any Improvement (or any decline) in general trade.
7? QCONFIDENTIAL.ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.Mr. HIRST enquired whether it was a general experience that better payment was now being obtained from Germany. It was stated that before the war the practice was for payments to be made by German firms in 30 days: since the war 90 days had been allowed, with the option  of another 90: but they now paid at 90 days without difficulty.Mr, Samuel said that in the business with which he had formerly been connected it had been found that accounts from Germany were now being paid regularly.Proceeding,Mr. Hirst said that the Electrical Industry was enjoying what might be described as a mixed prosperity, the lighter side  ( cables, lamps, telephones, eto) was extremely well occupied:     orders were booked ahead for a considerable time and employment was increasing: Indeed, October had been a reoord month, business being some ten per cent, better than the best month hitherto.In the heavy side of the industry however, conditions were by no means so favourable.   It was true that a good deal of new plant was required for current supply on account of the backwardness in development of many power stations, and also as a result of Government encouragement to railways, municipalities eto., to place orders:   but the sections dependant upon Coal-mining, Ship-building, the steel trade, and indeed the heavy industries generally, were badly situated and the works concerned were practically shut down.The export trade in general was not good,   Australia furnished the outstanding exception:   her capacity to absorb electrical plant was remarkable.He regretted to observe that many orders had recently been placed abroad by British Municipalities. While there might be something to be said for competitive private firms placing their orders strictly in the cheapest market, the case seemed different with public bodies, who might reflect that though perhaps some  10,000 might be saved on a contract, a larger sum would at the same time have been lost In wages to our own workers. Their aotion was also a bad advertisement for British manufactures in the eyes of the world.In reply to a question, Mr. Hirst said there was no shortage of labour   in the electrical industry:   they had no doubt teen able to attract men from other trades.
IRON AND STEEL.Mr. DORMAN said that sinoe the Election rather more confidence had been shown in the heavy iron and steel trade. A few orders were being placed for ships, but generally the demand for oteel was much below the normal.   The exports for September were lower than for any month this year, while imports amounted to 207,000 tons - the highest sinoe May. Plates from the Continent were coming in in large quantities,      j especially from Germany - in excess indeed of pre-war imports. Continental competition had continued to be keen during October, though it was true that continental prices had been rising during the last few days.The sheet trade was still good, though the demand was not quite so aotive.   Wire was quiet, the trade being faced with continental competition with low costs of production.   Coal prices were down, but still remained high as compared with pre-war.He had recently visited the steel-producing districts of Belgium the Ruhr, and Alsace-Lorraine.   He found that the Belgians were losing money, and were nervous of German competition.   The Germans also were losing money and were contemplating forming an association - a projeot whioh had since matured, some 95f&apos; of the steel producers coming into it. It did not yet seem possible to say what the effeot of this would be.   The German manufacturers were apprehensive of the future, expecting that they would have to export almost the whole of their production, possibly at a loss.As regards Alsace-Lorraine, the steel produced there had in former days gone almost entirely to the German home market. After the lapse of the existing Treaty provisions on 10th January next, the German Government would probably impose a duty on it, though the French were at present engaged in negotiations with them on this subject.   He himself thought it was in the interest of British manufacturers that alsace-Lorraine steel should continue to go to Germany, rather than be thrown on the world market.Australia continued to be a good market for iron and steel, but India was placing some orders for rails on the Continent.Constructional steel was in good demand, notably for use in London.In general, he thought that somewhat more confidence was being felt in the iron and steel trade, but the position was still an anxious one,Mr. BAKER thought also, that there were indications of improvement in the iron and steel trades.   Prioes were hardening, and a further rise of lj points had taken plaoe in wages governed by the &quot;steel Smelters&apos; Sliding Scale&quot;.   This was the third rise of l\ points which had taken place during this year. The price of shares in steel concerns was also going up, and this might be taken as an: indication that those having inside information looked for an improvement.
CONFIDENTIAL. IRON AND STEEL.He did not think, however, that at the present moment the Iron and steel trades were in a prosperous condition. Very few firms were making a profit.  At the same time output was keeping up: the production of ingots and castings was higher than that of 1913, and nearly up to the 1920 level.   Even so, however, many works were still idle and seemed likely to remain so.The large supplies of scrap left over by the war were now being used up, and this fact ought to assist the pig iron makers.His deduction from the whole situation was that an improvement in the Iron and Steel trades might be looked for by the ond of the year or n*xt spring.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.Sir Alan Andergon said that freights were somewhat better: the seasonal autumn rise had been sharper and more marked than usual.   The index number for October was 10% higher than in October of last year, and 6$ higher than in September of this year.Shipping laid up in the United Kingdom amounted to 533,000 tons, less than half the figure at this time last year.   The freight market however, was still influenced by the existence of the surplus tonnage.   The total world tonnage at the present time exceeded that of 1914 by 15 million gross tons.   Prom this, however, had to be deducted some 4 million tons representing an increase in &quot;Tanker&quot; tonnage, 4i million tons for vessels over twenty-five years old, and 4 million tons for the United States Shipping Board&apos;s ineffective tonnage: this brought down the excess over 1914 to a net figure of some 2f million tons.It was sometimes said that British shipowners were backward in replacing oat of date vessels: this suggestion, however, was not borne out by the figures, which showed that in June 1924 in Great Britain our tonnage^over 20 years old amounted to only 18-1$, as against over 31$ in the rest of the world (apart from the United. States, where the situation was a special one).   Altogether, the world&apos;s seagoing steam tonnage included 13,630,000 tons over 20 years of age, of which 7,700,000 was over 25 years.   Much of this would probably soon be turned to scrap, and the Council had heard from Mr, Baker that the supply of scrap was now running short.The chief new faetor in the situation was the advent of the Diesel Engine.   During the year ending June, 1914 there had been a decline in the world&apos;s steam tonnage of 1,164,000 tons, while during the same period the world&apos;s motor tonnage rose by 334,000 tons   or 15/&apos;s.
SHIPBTTILDING. 00L.LITHG0W (by letter),In my judgment there is very little ground for any feeling of optimism, as it appears to me that the existing handicaps on British industry in respect of high costs of production preclude the possibility of our obtaining a share of export orders sufficient to maintain our industries en a scale of prosperity sufficient to meet the burdens which, under existing circumstances, industry must inevitably bear, and at the same time provide the industrial population with a standard of living such as they have been led to expect.Taking Shipbuilding as an illustration,   eur experience over the last three years proves to my mind that reduced costs would bring a revival.   We got our men to accept sacrifices which greatly helped us, although none of our sub-contractors accepted their proper share of the burden, and international complications quickly obscured tho effect. Following on these events the industrial world was dis-disturbed early in 1923 by a cycle of wages advances quite unjustified by the state of trade, and having their birth in exploitation of a favourable situation by the dockers. The present position is that we have had to forego some of the advantages in reduced costs which we enjoyed six months ago, and the general level of Shipbuilding costs today is distinctly above that of foreign competing countries, and also above the level which the. freight markets of the world justify.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.During the quarter ending September 1924, the new tonnage commenced throughout the world  mounted to some 257,000 tons for steam vessels and 261,000 tons for motor vessels. Ordinary tramp-owners were not yet building: the demand at present was only for special ships,   Diesel-engined vessels represented a considerably higher first cost, so that owners must expect them to be distinctly more econcmical in working The general effect of these developments would be to accelerate the breaking up of old ships,The point had not yet been reached at which shipowners in the mass would begin to build, but this should soon come about.   For an increase&apos;in the demand for their services, shipowners looked particularly to the financial restoration of Europe and to the righting of the exchanges.   He was sanguine that there ought to be a general improvement in world trade before long, but hoped that the Government would not attempt to stimulate this artificially by loans under Trade Facilities Act and similar means - the effect of which he felt, could only be prejudicial.Reverting to the supply of motor vessels, Sir Alan agreed that the proportion of Diesel tonnage being built on the Continent, relatively to steam tonnage was greater than in this country, but British shipowners were building a larger actual amount of motor shipping.
SHIPBUILDING.There is, however, one element of stability about our presont costs j they compare very favourably with those of other British industries, and this leads me to the belief that while tho whole basis is unsound taking a long view, there is no immediate prospect of further reduction. We may, therefore, look for a continuance of a moderate stream of orders, having their rise in a desire to find investment for available funds, and a feeling that no advantage would bo gained by further delay, rather than in any immediate prospect of profit in trading.In my view, the future cannot but see a steady inorease in the effectiveness of foreign competition unless the whole basis of British costs is seriously&apos; modified.Ool. Lithgow also drew attention to oertain factors militating against&apos;a revival, such as low output per worker (70$ of pre-war), high level of rates and taxes; unemployment benefit&apos;and relief exoeedlng or approximating to a labourers wage.    He advocated ascertaining authoritatively and publishing why the cost of living w&amp;a so high.OPAL.MR. EVAN WILLIAMS ;py letter).The position in this industry is beooming increasingly serious.   The diminution in Gorman output of coal consequent on the oooupation of the Ruhr, aided in the months of March and April by the fear of a strike of miners in this oountry, kept the demand for coal, particularly for Export, up to the highest point ever reached. When these oauaeB were removed, there was, as might be expeoted, and as was predicted, a rapid reaction, the demand for coal fell off, prioes were reduced below cost, collieries worked irregularly and some were shut down, so that much under-employment and unemployment resulted.When the effects of the precautionary stocking of coal by buyers and consumers wore off, the trade found itself faced with a condition of things even worse. German production had grown greatly, and not only were reparation deliveries resumed to Franoe and Italy, but, what is even more serious, competition of a most severe kind was met from German coal in free markets, both in noutral and allied countries.   Exports continued to fall in quantity and price. There are still deliveries being made on contracts made early in the year at higher prioeB, but these are beooming less and less, and when exhausted will leave the position to that extent worse, in rogard to average prices and in regard to volume of export, owing to the impossibility in very many cases of renewal in face of the lower prioe of German coal.
COAL.Added to these factors is the effect of the depression in the Iron and Steel trades upon the demand for coal in this country itself.   The reaction of bad export trade alone would have tended to reduce prices for inland coal.   The great reduction in consumption has aggravated the position seriously.The nett result is that the total output has fallen by nearly half a million tons per week, and some part of this has to be put on bank as unsaleable at all in present circumstances.   The Industry as a whole is making a loss; some of the districts, particularly those dependent on export are losing very heavily, while only those supplying the best house coal are making any profit.There does not seem to be any prospect of any change in the position abroad.   Production at French collieries is increasing steadily and the potential output of German collieries is nearly double their actual production to-day.The remedy for the trouble must be sought in this country.   The cause is that our oosts of production are too high for ub to compete with foreign coals and for us to be able to sell to our home manufacturers at prices whioh will enable them to make their goods and sell them against foreign competition.   Unless and until we can materially reduce our coBts there is not only no hope of improvement but a grave risk of deterioration.The polioy of reducing hours of work and increasing wages while lowering output is responsible for the state into which Industry has got in this country.The effect of that in other industries contributes to the increased cost of all materials used in the&apos;production of coal, while the reduction of hours in the Coal Industry itself is the main cause of the great Increase in the oost of working the coal, bringing it to the surface and putting it into truck.The high minimum secured by the Miners in the present agreement is another important factor in the situation.     The point at which the lose in working exoeeds the loss in keeping a pit idle, is more quickly reached, and the warning which was given to the miners that a high wage rate would result in low earnings has been proved true.The position in the Coal Industry can be saved, but only by determination on the part of all concerned in it, to face resolutely the task of reducing the costs of production to enable us to hold our markets *t home and abroad, both for ooal and manufactured goods.
*? 9 &apos;confidential. TEXTILES - OOTTON.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN said that the feeling in the cotton trade was distinotly more hopeful.   In the American section of the trade, short time had been worked for a considerable period: they were, now however beginning to spin at a profit for the first time for several years: he was hopeful that short-time working would be reduced in this seotlon.   It now seemed clear that Amerioa would be able to fulfil Manchester spinners&apos; requirements of raw ootton.The Egyptian seotion, however, which had hitherto been working full time with a reasonable margin of profit, was now if anything not quite so well off.   This was due largely to an entire laok of confidence in Lancashire in the Egyptian Government&apos;s statistics of their orop.   There was considerable ground for believing that these were being manipulated by the Egyptian Government, whioh was itself dealing in ootton.   The matter was being investigated, and he hoped to be able to bring more definite faots before the Council in due oourse.   Though the Egyptian Government were giving out that there was a shortage,thus disturbing spinners and buyers, personally he thought that plenty of Egyptian cotton tfoulg be available.The export trade to the Empire was being fairly well maintained.   Business with India, in partloular, was also better, and America was taking a fa^r amount of cloth.   It was, however, difficult to deal with the Continent, on account of credit and exohange difficulties: also the ootton trade seemed not quite so fortunate as the woollen trade in obtaining payment from Germany: the position in this matter was causing some anxiety, as Germany was one of our chief yarn markets.The home trade was not yet satisfactory, but he hoped for an improvement shortly, now that cotton prices were down to a reasonable level. It was an unusual and rather disquieting feature that a considerable amount of Belgian yarn was now coming to this country.It should be mentioned that a rather serious difficulty might be met with when trade revived, in the fact that Lancashire had lost a large peroentage of her skilled weavers. This was the &quot;bottle neck&quot; of the Industry, so to speak, and the aotual shortage of weavers might seriously retard efforts to improve the general employment situation.   This shortage was due principally to the fact that mills had been working short time for the last three years, and consequently large numbers of the weavers (whioh is largely female labour) had been drawn out of the industry to alternative employment, or when married were not replaced.   The industry had become an unattractive one to &quot;train on&quot;..8-ram
TEXTILES - COTTON.Mr. JUDSON observed that an additional reason was the abolition of the &quot;half-timer&quot;, and the raising of the age at which ohildren were classed as operatives from 13 to 14. Re-adjustment to the new conditions might take a year or two.Our customers were now beginning to realise that cotton goods were as cheap as they were likely to be for some time to come.   We were still very dependent on the American supplies of the raw materialt but there had been a big reduction in prioe,A decision had recently been  cached by the employers to work a 40 hour week (as against a maximum of 48 hours): this compared very favourably with the 261 hour week which was previously being worked.A greater feeling of confidence was being shown, he thought%t throughout the world; payments, except from Germany, were coming in well.SIR WILLIAM CLARE LEES (by letter).The general outlook in the cotton trade is distinctly better.There Is a certainty of a more adequate supply of raw cotton during the next twelve months.   Although this has produced a lower level of prices for the raw material, the price of raw cotton is still well above the general average of world prices for other commodities.Further, the reduction In the price of raw cotton has not produced a lower range of prices in manufactured goods.   In spite of the fact that raw cotton is pence a pound cheaper t han it was twelve months ago, cloth is shillings a piece dearer. This is due to the fact that spinners and manufacturers were producing at a heavy loss last year,, which is no longer the case:   and, also, to the fact that 3hort&quot;time working adds materially to the cost of production.Two faotors are at work, therefore, in the minds of over-seas buyers in the world*s markets.   In the first place, I believe, they are at present undergoing a process of disillusionment.   Everyone has been waiting for lower prices, and, now that ootton is more plentiful, and somewhat cheaper, goods are actually dearer.   On the other hand, there is a psychological effect in favour of increased business.   Buyers have been waiting to see what prices would be when there was enough cotton to go round.   Now they know, and, though the price level must be a disappointment to them, they do know where they are and they also know that cotton is not likely to fall heavily from these prices, so there is not muoh to be gained by waiting.
ikl &apos;0TEXTILES - COTTON.Again, the prioe level of most agricultural products is upwards, which must inorease the purchasing power of our customers^ there is still a considerable disparity between their prioes and ours, but they are drawing closer together.   From tois, I conclude that the price of cotton piece goods is still so high that it must tend to limit consumption, particularly in the East.On the other hand, there are favourable factors at work, which, while not providing a demand equal to pre-war quantities, will work in our favour, and provide better employment than has been the case during the last two years.The need to-day is rigid economy at home, in order that taxeB may bo reduced, and capital allowed to increase, and then courageous expenditure, in reproductive development, at home and abroad.TEXTILES - WOOL.MR. ANDREWS observed that at the last meeting, six weeks ago, Hi had referred to the rise in wool prices, which thon amounted to some 10 to 15$.   Subsequently, owing to the supply of Australian currency being insufficient to meet demands, hoavy withdrawals had taken place, and prices had again dropped by some 10$.   The Australian Government and the Banks had, however, handled the situation well and had relieved the stringency by the iBsue of  15 millions more currency.    Further the results of the elections hero and in the United States had engendered greater confidonoe in buyers; and prices were now once more up to the September level.   This readiness to buy wool was stimulated by two factors, namely (l) shortage of the supply and (S) the improved financial position in Germany. He understood that last month Germany had taken a quarter of all the wool sold in Queensland - a very large proportion.   Six months ago Bradford traders had found they oould not get payments from Germany, but, since the Dawes Report had oome into operation, remittances had come through freely and Germany oould now pay almost on pre-war terms.   This would be specially of assistance to spinners of the medium and lower grades.   The spinners of the finest quality yarnB were fairly well situated,&apos; but the position in the ordinary grades was not so satisfactory, and work was only proceeding up to some 60$ of capacity.
r-j Cf t*jTEXTILES - WORSTED. EtcMr. SUTCLIFPE SMITH said that the general situation in the wool and worsted textile trade oontinued much the same, but more oonfidenoe seemed to be felt.   The situation in spinning waB better.   As regards weaving, he had at the last meeting reported that only 50$ of looms were working, but an improvement of some 10$ had taken place during the last few weeks.   The high price of raw wool was acting as a deterrent to buyersj but they would probably come forward more readily now that they were beooming used to the new level of prices. Frenoh and Italian competition was still severe.Many more enquiries were now being reoeived from India: China was very bare of goods, and should provide good business when greater political stability had been reaohed.   He had already, at the last meeting, drawn attention to the increasing Japanese competition in China.   Steady business was being .done with Egypt, the Dominions and South America.   The wool trade desired to associate themselves with the ootton trade in asking that everything possible should be done to ensure that we have an equal opportunity with Franoe In German trade.   As regards the question of the treatment of Alsace-Lorraine goods going Into Germany, the Bradford Dyers&apos; Association were already in touch with the Board of Trade.Generally, a distinctly more hopeful feeling was now showing itself and he felt confident that, if stability in the exohangea oould be reaohed, employment would become good.GENERAL TRADE - FOOD INDUSTRIES^Mr. MACKIN   said that the reports received by the Association of Chambers of commerce tended rather to confirm the general hopeful outlook.In the food-manufacturing industry there were signs of a revival of oonfidenoe and of an increased demand, especially from overseas markets, except south America.     Continental markets   were, however, in several oases, increasing tariffs to our detriment? in some instances British firms had found it necessary to establish factories abroad? this would naturally be prejudicial to employment in this country.He would mention, with regard to the lace industry, that he had heard serious complaints at Ncttingham of the severity of Frenoh competition.
NON-FERROUS METALS. MR. TAIT (by letter). Copper.On the whole the manufacturing industries in this country are fairly well employed, and in some cases, such as wire-drawing, are very fully employed.   Continental competition is being felt a good deal in Eastern markets for sheets; supplies of raw metal are ample, and prioes have only moved upwards to the extent of 3 to 4$,Spelter.The industries using Spelter are not going at capacity or at the normal pre-war rate, but are moderately well-supplied with orders.   If consumption were to increase a shortage of Spelter is probable, as the Continent has little to spare and the U.S.A, consumption is sufficient to absorb all the production possible from their richer ores.   It is very desirable that Spelter production at home should be stimulated in any way possible.Lead,The consumption in this country has been running recently at about 22,000 tons per month, which is substan-tlally above pre-war.   All branches of manufacture are active, and the Cable trade particularly so.   Tho same applies to the Continent where there is a heavy demand for pig-lead,.   There are no stocks of metal anywhere, and no new production.Aluminium.The consumption of the metal shows steady progress, not only In the Motor industry both for ingot metal and sheets but there is an increasing demand for electrical transmission lines both in the Dominions and on the Continent - partlcu-larly in France.   The sheet trade is fairly well-supplied with orders not only for this country but recently also for India.CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY said that the situation wf the chemical industry had remained practically stationary.   A good index was furnished by the production of sulphurio acid, which now amounted to some 62$ ef this country5s producing capacity.   Business In agricultural fertilisers, however, especially superphosphates, was much worse.Of sulphur as a raw material at least fte-sixths of our requirements had to be imported, especially from q oAs regards payments from Germany, his firm&apos;s experiences were that Germ-any was not at present able to pay quite as readily as had been hoped.   Some apprehension was felt as to the position that would arise in some of our smaller industries, such as printing, pottery, and Birmingham wares, when Germany was once more set on her feet and the full force of her competition made itself felt,
CHEMICALS.Sioily*where   the mines are controlled by the Italian Government. A few weeks ago that Government had refused payment in sterling, demanding that it should be made in United States dollars.   The particular contract to which this referred had been signed, to run till 1929,   In view of the rate of exoh*nge sgreed upon, however, by the Italian Government (4.30 dollars to the  ) it seemed likely that the arrangement might operate to our advantage rather than otherwise.He felt bound to call attention to the apparent inability of the British Dyestuffs Corporation to fulfil the objects with which it was set up.   The chemical industry felt that the Corporation had not succeeded in making our textile industry independent of foreign dyes and also was not likely to provide the needed measure of assistance for chemical warfare.   He hoped that these points, would receive attention.RUBBER MANUFACTURES.Mr   BIRLEY, said that from the rubber manufacturers1 point^of1 view, the recent rise in the price of the raw material of about 50$ waa naturally not a favourable factor. The home market for Rubber goods had improved, and the output of factories had increased, though there had been a big increase in plant during the war with consequent very small margins of profit.   South Africa, Australia and India, were the industry!s best customers.   The Australian and Indicii markets had improved, and South America was sending some inquiries, but German competition was keen there. The demand from Europe was poor, except from Scandinavia for waterproof garments which were largely a monopoly of this country.   In the home market United States competition had slackened off, but French and Italian competition was strong, and increasing.FINANCE.Mr. BRAND said that the International financial position   was at present peculiar: exceptionally low money rates obtained in the United States, as contrasted with extremely high rates in Europe (apart from this country): the latter would, however, almost Inevitably have some effect on rates In this country.   The situation In the United States might change quickly: it was likely that there would be a big increase of trade there, and large sums whioh had been lent to Europe on short terras would then be required back.   Very large amounts of American money Were at present going to Germany,&apos; but probably the Germans would prefer to have English, because when any crisis came, Americans were apt to demand their money back at once,
FINANCE.There was at present a very heavy demand for credit on London - bigger indeed than we oould fulfil! for every pound we have available to lend abroad we could lend 3ome three or four.   In these circumstances he held that there was praotioally no occasion for Trade Facilities Act loans to be made for purposes abroad, and he was inclined to associate himself with sir Alan Anderson in deprecating their use for such purposes.German currency would probably remain sound for the next year or two, but as that oountry began to find itself having to make large reparation payments, and at the same time repay short-terra borrowings, and meet the interest on heavy loans, a demand on the German exchange might arise which it would not be able to bear.   The high rates&apos; now being paid by Germany for loans might only further encourage lenders.   In addition, extensive foreign buying of German securities was now taking plaoo, in viow of the specially favourable conditions - even of the old German War Loan.. With rogard to the French Exchange, the Bank of Franco was quite oapablo of supporting it temporarily, but ultimately its course depended on the French Budget, which was still far from being balanced.He considered that sterling in the United States had recently appreciated more than existing price levels warranted; this might be attributed in some part to the faot that loanB whioh tho United States have made to a large number of countries, are being extensively converted into sterling.FINANCE AND BANKING.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE said that the trade reports, reoeived by his1 Hank went generally to confirm tho opinions expressed in the Council.   Banking figures went some way to confirm the more ontimistic tone.    There was an increased demand for credits! also an increase in deposits by  23,000,000 had taken place in the last month: this was represented on the asset side to the extent of one-half by the increase in advances, and to the extent of the other half by the inorease in bills.   Deposits were only some 4 millions up as compared with a year ixf:o, but advances had inoreaBed by over 60 millions; this additional credit had been found by the banks by means of a realisation of their investments to the extent of  25 millions, and by letting bills run off to the amount of some  35 rail lions.
CONFIDENTIAL.FINANCE.There was at present a very heavy, demand for credit on London - bigger indeed than we oould fulfil: for every pound we have available to lend abroad we could lend some three or four.   In these circumstances he held that there was praotioally no occasion for Trade Facilities Act loans to be made for purposea abroad, and he was inclined to associate himself with Sir Alan Anderson in deprecating their use for suoh purposes.German currency would probably remain sound for the next year or two, but as that country began to find itself having to make large reparation payments, and at the same time repay short-term borrowings, and meet the interest on heavy loan3, a demand on the German exchange might arise whioh it would not be able to bear.

AND. BANKING.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE said that the trade reports, reoeivecT&apos;by&apos; his&quot;Bank&quot;went generally to confirm tho opinions expressed in the Council.   Banking figures went some way to confirm the more optimistic tone.   There was an increased demand for credits: also an increase in deposits by  23,000,000 had taken place in the last -month: this was represented on the asset aide to the extent of one-half by the increase in advances, and to. the extent of the other half by the increase in bills.   Deposits were only some 4 millions up as compared with a year ap:o, but advances had increased by over 60 millions; this additional credit had been found by the- banks by means of a realisation of their investments to the extent of  25 millions, and by letting bills run off to the amount of some  35 millions.
7n -3FINANCE AND BANKING.One of the chief factors which would influenoe a rise in Bank rate was the United States exchangej although this was the time of year at which there was a seasonal demand for dollars, the dollar rate had nevertheless been improving considerably, and probably a large proportion of seasonal requirements had already been satisfied.   This improvement in the exohange was probably largely a matter of sentiment - attributed by some observers to the prospects of a stable Government.   Another faotor in the situation was the weakness of the French franc: and further, people who a short time ago had been putting their money into dollars were now again transferring it to sterling.Mr. TENNANT said that his Bank!s Branch Reports went to confirm &quot;the views generally expressed at the meeting, though perhaps their tone was not quite so optimistic. He did not observe any fresh inorease in the demand for money for trade.Asked as to the likelihood of a rise in prioes in the United States on account of the exohange, and other reasons, Mr. Tennant said that this had been generally expected, and it was a-matter for some surprise that it, had not yet taken plaoe.   Probably it would do so shortly, and should then have repercussions here in our favour.With regard to Trade Facilities Act loans, he was disposed to agree that their use was not desirable for the benefit of foreign concerns, but considered that these loans had done much good for concerns at home.The possibility of a rise in the Bank Rate seemed to depend largely on conditions in the United States; otherwise it did not seem probable.mto SANDERSON said that the reoent widespread rains in Australia had made prospects good for pastoral and agricultural! interests.     The harvest prospects for wheat were very good.The wool crop was estimated at over 2 ,million bales, with an estimated value of  70,000,000 - about 400,000 bales more than last year.The Queensland yield of seed ootton to date (8th November) amounted to 15 million pounds from 35,000 acres. An unofficial estimate put new planting at 60.000 acres, but a reliable estimate would not be available till December.AUSTRALIAN&apos; TRADE.ifii!
Mac)AUSTRALIAN TRADE.Cotton growing in New South Wales was now mostly-restricted to districts where it was likely to succeed under normal conditions.   Last season there were effectively planted about 1,000 aore.3 and a better yield was expected than any previously experienced.Recent prices of citrus fruit in both local and over-seas markets had resulted in considerable further planting.The exchange situation in relation to wool buying in Australia bad been largely relieved by recent arrangements made by the Associated Banks, on the initiative of the Commonwealth Bank, for pooling wool oredits.The prioe at present being realised for lead must be of great value to mining interests.Information so far   to    hand did not enable him to say exactly how the new Preference conditions, to whioh he had referred at the last meeting, on British imports into Australia would affect British Manufacturers, but exports from this oountry to Australia were on a large scale and oomprised a great variety of articles.Asked whether Australian cotton growers were confident that they could increase their production at the present price of cotton, while using white labour, Mr. Sanderson said that at present they were satisfied that it could be done by small growers employing family labour.   The dairy industry in Australia had been started by similar methods. A oertain Government subsidy was being given to cotton growing,CANADIAN TRADE.MR. LARKIN said that so far as the trade of Great Britain was affected by loss of business in Canada, he thought this was probably due only to temporary oauseb. Canada had enjoyed good crops and good prioes for some years past, and the effect of this ought probably to make itself felt here duringthe next few months.INDIAN TRADE.MR. LINDSAY Baid that Indian trade remained on the whole satisfactory.   TEe usual seasonable falling off was shown in exports, but not for so long a period aa usual: normally a Black season was expected from June to September inclusive, but this year it had lasted only for some two months. Probably this was because there had been little buying of Indian products for stock, but mostly for Immediate consumption with the result that buyers throughout the world could not hold off.
INDIAN TRADE.The import position was satisfactory.   Imports for September were the highest for any month since October, 1922. Imports of cotton piece goods had increased during September, and indeed were the highest, with one exception, for the last two years.Imports of bullion continued, encouraged by the rise in the exchange: the amount of gold taken during September had reached a very high figure,NEW ZEALAND TRAD ASIR J^iMES ALLEN (by letter).With regard to the present position you will be interested to learn that this year shows a considerable increase in the New Zealand trade.     For instance the value of imports into my Dominion for the first six months of this year were valued at  22,644,403 the figures for the corresponding period of 1923 having been  21,190,732. During the present session an announcement was made in the New Zealand Parliament that the regulations governing the entry of partially manufactured goods under the British Preferential Tariff were to be amended.   A copy of the proposed amendment is enclosed from which it will be seen that further encouragement i3 being given to British manufacturers.CHINA,MR. LAND ALE (by letter).Since the fighting ceased in the Shanghai district business has been resumed and deliveries of both import and export cargo have improved.The unsettled state of political affairs in Peking, however, interferes with business generally, more particularly as regards orders for Railway and Engineering material, &quot; fjContintental prices for the latter are still some 20 to 30$ below those quoted by manufacturers In this country.British prices for Textile goods are still too high for a large business to be transacted.RAILWAYS.SIR HERBERT VilALKER said that he could not hold out hopes of an early reduction in Railway rates and charges, since costs remained at something like 100$ above the level of 1913, while rates and charges were only 50$ higher.Owing to the greater stability of prices and conditions at the present time, the Railway Companies would probably be more willing than heretofore, to undertake new works.
RAILWAYS.As regards volume of traffio carried, though the figures were not divided by trades, it oould be said that the home coal trade was good and better than last year, but the loss of the export coal trade had heavily affected the figures.Carryings of general tonnage, however, were good,.and going up eaoh week,MR. BROOKE!   observed that the traffic receipts of the railways were not entirely a fair indication of the course of trade, since the loss of receipts had been concentrated upon coal and coke, in which a decrease of six million tons had taker, place up to the end of August: but general merchandise, apart from coal and coke, was improving.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (SCOTLAND)MR. GALLAGHER said that   the Scottish Co-operative Societies had again found a small decline in their business.   This was specially noticeable in the grocery department.   The drapery and boot and shoe sections, however, were doing well.   The furniture branch was somewhat slack, probably owing to the fact that new houses had not yet reached the stage where occupation takes place.   The price of groceries generally, especially butter, .cheese and tea, had tended to rise.The Societies&apos; factories were all well employed, with the exoeption of the mills manufacturing high class Scotch tweeds: the demand for these had been slack since 1920, having been diverted to the oheaper grades of cloth.The Societies&apos; business well reflected the trade position in Scotland, more particularly the Western areas the staple Industries of that region, the coal trade and shipbuilding, were quiet, but there   was a hopeful feeling for the future.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (ENGLAND).SIR THOMAS ALLEN   said that the English Co-operative Societi latest returns showed an inorease in business of 14.5^ over the previous three months and 6,3* over the corresponding period of last year: their situation seemed somewhat more favourable than that of the Scottish Societies.Consumers generally, he thought, would welcome Mr. Baldwin1s proposal to institute an Inquiry into retail prices.   Retail food prices were higher to-day than they had been for the past three years, those for October standing about 6% points above the September figure.   The enquiry might do something to avoid the threatened demands for higher wages.The increased purchasing power of Germany was now making its effect felt in the United Kingdom in regard to food prices. Large quantities of lard-had been shipped from North America to the Continent, and this led to an increase of price in the British market.   Similarly Dutch cheese, large quantities of which used formerly to come to the United Kingdom, was nown practically all finding its way to Germany.   Germany had also come into the market for Empire produce such as butter, with corresponding effects upon prices.   He understood that an
CONFIDENTIAL. CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (ENGLAND),arrangement was being entered into between Germany and Russia for direct shipment of next year&apos;s output of Siberian butter, of whioh we had thia year taken a considerable quantity, with benefioial results to British consumers.   This country had been a very considerable buyer of Danish butter also during the last few months:,  here again, as a result of German buying, prices had advanced from 30/- to 50/- per cwt., or 4d per lb to the consumer.   For the same reason the price of sultanas had gone up 5/- per cwt owing to Germany^ operations on the market.He would be glad to hear how matters now stood in regard to the attitude of Greece towards this country in relation to this season&apos;s currant crop.   The crop this year was practically the finest on record, but for the first time the Greek Government and imposed an export tax equivalent to some 5/- per cwt.   Importers regarded this as an infringement of Treaty obligations and had made representations in regard to it.The president  observed that the Anglo^Greek Treaties had been denounced.   The matter would, however, be carefully looked Into.
CONFIDENTIAL. ANNEX.FORBIQH TRADE IN OCTOBER. 1924.The arrival of ootton and wheat from the new harvests in the United States and Canada is reflected In the import total for October, which, at  120,458,000 is nearly  20,000,000 greater than the September total.Exports for the month, which totalled  68,567,000 show an inorease of  5,304,000 on the preceding month and re-exports, at  12,931,000 an increase of  3,365,000.Bullion and Specie movements show an excess of imports of  481,000, an exoeptlon to the export excess whioh has been usual since the war.The excess of imports over exports has reaohed the quite exceptional figure of  39,421,000 for the month, taking merchandise and bullion and specie together.The following statement compares the October figures with corresponding figures for recent periods.Total Imports......Exports (U.K.GOods),Re-ExportsExcess of Exports (*0 ) or of Imports (*) ) of Bullion and Specie)Exoess of Imports Merchandise and Bullion................October, 1924.120,45868,58712,9314- 48139 , 421Values In Thousand  ,Monthly Aye rage.September, 1924.100,89563,2839,566-1,39226,654Aug-Oct&apos;.

British Exports may be estimated at about 24 per oent. less and re-exports at about 11 per oent. less than in 1913.(2) Retained Imports.Imports less Re-exnorts.July-September, 1924.April-June, 1924.J anuary-March, 1924.October-Deoember, 1925.July-September, 1923.Mill.  .   &apos; Mill.  .Pood, Drink, and Tobacco.........I-iaw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured....&apos;Artioles wholly or mainly manufacturedKill.  .84.0 (72.2)-43.8 (40,2)50.3 (42.8)Mill.  .82.3 (68.5) -40.7 (42.2)44.5 (43.2)Mill.  .81.8 (62.3)44.3 (59.9)38.9 (42.2)90.1 (75.9)50.5 (63.9)39.2 (43.3)71.7 (72,2)35.4 (40.2)38.6 (42.8)
