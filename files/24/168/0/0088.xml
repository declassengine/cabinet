63&apos;fl(THIS document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET CP. 485 (24)cabinet home AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. EXPIRING LAWS CONTINUANCE BILL. 1924. (Memorandum by the Finanoial Seoretary to the Treasury).This Bill was introduced by the late Government in July.   It now, however, becomes necessary to reintroduoe and repriut it in order that it may be considered during the forthcoming short session and passed into law before 31st Deoember next.I have t* draw the attention of the Committee to two amendments whioh it is proposed to make in the Bill as introduced by the late Government.1.    Agricultural Rates Aots.Clause 1, page 2, line 10 at end insert, &quot;Provided that nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to oontinue the Agricultural Sates Act 1923&quot;.Tbe Sohedule of Acts to be oontinued by the Bill as introduced in the last Parliament included the Agricultural Sates Act 1896.   &apos; The Preamble to the Bill deolared it expedient t* provide for the continuance of the Aots in the Sohedule &quot;and *f the enactments amending or affecting the same&quot;,   fne of the Aots &quot;amending or affecting&quot; the Agricultural Rates Aot 1896 is the Agricultural Rates Aot 1923.   It was the original Intention of the late
Government to continue the latter Act in their Bill until it wag found that to do so.would require the passing of a Financial Resolution to cover tho charge involved in the continuance of the additional grants payable under the Act. It was then decided that a more satisfactory method of dealing with tho extension cf the Act of 1923 would he to omit it from the Schedule to the Bill (thus doing   away with the necessity of a Financial Resolution during the passage of the Bill) and to obtain beforo 31st March 1925, when the Act of 1923 expires, a small Bill extending tho Act   of 1923 and so worded as to enable tho latter to he extended in future, if desired, by an Expiring laws Bill without a Financial Resolution.    Parliamentary Counsel later advised that despite the fact that tho Act of 1923 was not in tho Schedule to the Bill it could in fact have been hold to be continued by the Bill by virtue of the word in the Preamble quoted above.   Thus to avoid tho doubts which might later arise and to satisfy the authorities of the House who have ruled that the A0t of 1923 cannot be extended without a Resolution, it is, in the opinion of Parliamentary Counsel, essential to amend the Bill as shewn at. two cowmen&quot;^m^nt of this paragraph.The specific exclusion of the Agricultural Rates Act 1985 from the Sohedule may evoke comment but it should be possible to resist any tendency to a general discussion of the question of Agricultural Rates by making it quite clear that the Act of 1983 cannot properly be included in the Bill on technical grounds and by referring to the special Bill to be introduced at once extending the Act of 1923 for a further year, that is to the 51st March 1936.
2. -  National Health Insurance Act 1911. Section 42.Tho Schedule to tho Bill us introduced in the last Parliament included (Ho.  (5) of Part I of the Schedule) Section 42 of tho National Insurance Act 1911, which deals with the Post Office Pund arrangements for contributors who are not members of an approved Sooioty,, This section was subsequently repealed by the Kationa.. Health Insurance agt. 1924 as from 1st January 1925, but the latter Act contains a provision whioh reenaots the substance of Section 42 of the Act of 1911 and which in its turn is limited to expire on 51st Dgoember 19 25. In those circumstances it becomes necessary to delete the reference in the Expiring laws Continuance Bill to Section 42 r.f the Act of 1911,(Intld.)   W. Q,Treasury Chamberlain er a,loth November 1924c
*Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.MEMORANDUM.It is essential that this Bill should pass before the 31st December next.Save in two minor respects the draft Bill is the same as the Bill introduced by the late Government on the 18th July last.Tho departures from the former Bill are as follows: (1) The proviso at the end of clause 1 relating to the Agricultural Rates Act, 1923, did not appear in the former Bill. It has been inserted in order to make it clear that the present Bill does not propose to continue the Agricultural Rates Act, 1923, that Act containing money provisions which could not properly be continued by an Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.(2) S. 42 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, appeared in the Schedule to the former Bill bat is not included in the present Bill. The reason for its omission is that since the introduction of the former Bill the National Health Insurance Act, 1924, became law and thus has made the inclusion of s. 42 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, unnecessary.16-1a
