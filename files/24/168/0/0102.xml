1 TinS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIC&apos; MaJBSTY &apos;3 GOWRNMENT.^ 0 flCABINET. &apos;u &apos;:&apos;Provisional Programme of Legislation (Ministry of Health). Memorandum by the Ministj?r jof Hea1th 10 .P*499(24). Copy No,    btySECRET.1. With a prospect of a continuous administration for a few years ahead, it is possible to make plans in advance, and I have therefore been engaged in preparing a provisional programme of legislation dealing with various subjects in which the Ministry of Health are directly or indirectly concerned.2. Apart from Bills which will be required to replace various expiring enactments and some minor Departmental Bills, the programme represents a connected series of reforms spread over a period of 3 t.o 4 years, and if this programme is to be carried out it will be necessary to make an early start with some parts of it on which the work is more advanced in order to clear the way for the remainder.3. I append a schedule showing the proposed Bills and their approximate date of introduction.     I need not trouble the Cabinet at this stage with a detailed des-description of the various Bills or with the reasons for their proposed introduction, but I would draw attention to some of the more important measures.       1 refer In particular to the proposed Bills dealing with Poor Law, Valuation and Rating, Insurance, and Contributory schemes for Widows1 and old Age Pensions at 65.4c All political parties have repeatedly sub-scribed to the doctrine of Poor Law Reform, and the late Government under Parliamentary pressure appointed a Cabinet Committee which instructed the Ministry of Health to prepare a detailed schemes
Without recalling- the well-4motm.-ar^gum9Trtrs .in .     rj^rj ravour-of &quot;Poor Law Reform. I may note the following points:-(a) The overlapping of the Guardians&apos; functionswith the health funct ions of the Local Authorities constitutes an ever present difficulty in current administration, and until this overlapping is removed there can -be no real advance in&apos;the direction of a properly organised Health Service.     For exaaple, as matters stand, there may be numbers of empty beds in the Poor Law Infirmaries and long waiting lists at the Voluntary Hospitals, and proper use cannot be made of the total hospital accommodation in an area until there is in existence one health authority charged with the responsibility for the health of the area so far as that responsibility is a public one.(b) The developments in National Health Insurance whichmay be expected to follow from the findings of the-Royal Commission now sitting cannot be attained without the creation of a single health authority in each local area.     The National Health Insurance Scheme should obviously be linked up with the general Public Health organisation, and the readiest way to do this is to make the Insurance Committee which now administers medical benefit under the Insurance Scheme a Committee of the Local Health Authority.(c) The gradual diminution in the number of persons re-quiring assistance from.the Guardians, which has been going on since the Report of the Royal Corn-mission; was materially accelerated by the recent Unemployment Insurance Act, and a fur then\step... 2 ...
In this direction will be taken if a scheme for r) aWidows&apos; Pensions and Old Age Pensions commencing at 65 is adopted. (d)      Unless Poor law Reform Is undertaken In 1926 it will be necessary to ask Parliament to renew the Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Act which pro-vides for centralising the cost of outrelief in London.    This would revive in an acute form the problem of London government which in my view can only be resolved by a prior settlement of the Poor Law question.5.    At the present time Valuation and Rating are attached chiefly to the Poor Law areas and the Poor Law Authorities, and accordingly any schemes of Poor Law Reform which proceeds on the lines of transferring the functions of the Poor Law Guardians to other bodies would necessarily involve a reconstruction of the machinery of Valuation and Rating.    On the other hand there is no need to postpone the introduction of Valuation and Rating Reform until Poor Law Reform has been undertaken.    The existing valuation and rating systems present several long-rstanding claims for reform, and this reform is a condition precedent to the much needed revision of the financial relations between the State and the Local Authorities.A draft Bill was prepared and widely circulated over a year ago.     Its provisions have attracted a great deal of public attention, and on the whole have been favourably received, except by the Poor Law Authorities whose functions would be largely diminished.6.    In view of the advanced state of preparation of the bating and Valuation Bill it is most important to introduce and pass this Bill next year in order to clear the way for the remainder of the series of reforms included in my programme.
7. I accordingly suggest that the Cabinet (a) should give provisional approval to the appended programme of legislation, and (b) should appoint a Committee to settle certain points of policy in connection with     &apos; the Rating and Valuation Bill and to make recommendations as to tho main principles underlying the draft scheme of Poor Law Reform prepared by the Ministry of Health.(ihtd.)
