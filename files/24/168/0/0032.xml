In accordance with tho promise I gave at the4S0&quot;(24).meeting of the Cabinet on the morning of 30th July, (Cabinet 44(24) Oonolusion 2), I am.circulating herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a statement ehow-ing the variations in the number of men employed in Great Britain on works assisted by the Government and Local Authorities for the purpose of relieving unem-ployment at various dates since the Government took Office.The volume of employment on such works reached its maximum during this year on the 28th March, when the total was 125,558.There was a slight fall in the volume of employ-ment between the 28th March and the 18th April, when the total figure stood at 118,572.    After that date the figure rose again until on the 2nd May, It stood at 122,835.Slnoo the 2nd May, there has been a rapid deollne in the number of men employed on these works, and the total on the 4th July, was only 90,890.It will be noted that tho numbers employed on eohomea finanood under the Export Credits Scheme are excluded because figures are not available.I should warn my colleagues that owing ^o thedifficulty of collecting precise Information, some of.1       /the
the figures shown on the attached statement oan only bo regarded as approximately correot, s.nd it would be unwise for the figures to be quoted.The same element of ^oortamty ia, however, present in the figures for all four dates and, therefore, they oan legitimately be compared with eaoh other, and It is particularly to the alarming fall in the figures for May and June that I wish to draw the attention of tho Cabinet.(Intld.) T.S.Ministry of Labour. let August,. 1984.
