IS nOCUi&amp;iJT. IS THL PROPi-fiTi 01* HIS J&amp;II&amp;HlilQ w.foSTY&apos;ii GOV^MJ&amp;alT.OABIUIijgjSIT. fl.P.434 (24),POET   Of   RIOBBOROUGH.Mote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Port of Richborough was created by the War Office during the war splely to meet special war requirements and was in no sense the outcome of any industrial development in Kent.During the war enormous quantities of material amounting to, I understand, at least 2,000,000 tons were shipped from Richborough by ferries and barges to Dunkirk, Calais and Dieppe.     Similarly, after the Armistice, large quantities of railway wagons, guns and other heavy stores intended for retention by the Army were brought back from those French ports to i\ichborough. In addition to the above the Disposal Board used Richborough largely to bring back surplus material, Mechanical Transport, Railway Wagons, etc. which were more saleable in England than in France.So far, therefore, as Hichborough as a war proposition is concerned it has amply justified the expenditure incurred on it.The port was handed over by the sYar Office to the Ministry of Munitions as surplus to Government requirements in December, 1919, and the Disposal Board proceeded to sell such of the Richborough stores, machinery, etc. as were not likely to be required for the Port in peace-time.     In addition, large quantities of stores brought back from France were sold at Richborough, and it is not possible now testate how much the Richborough stores and plant proper has realised.-1-
The Disposal Board advertised the P0rt extensively for sale, but no serious proposals for purchase were forthcoming until tho end of 1980.     Eventually in March, 1921, the Contract for the sale of the Port to the Queenborough Development Company was entered into, but the Contract was subject to a recission clause which became operative if the Government failed to acquire all the lands specified on the plan forming part of the Contract.Owing to the change in the course of the River Stour, the yueenborough Company contended that the Government had not in fact complied with contract provisions regarding the purchase of land, and eventually, on the advice of the Law Officers of the Crown, that portion of the Contract dealing with the sale of the Port was rescinded in July,1922.     Apart from the legal aspect of the matter, the yueenborough Company were not in a financial position to permit of their carrying out the Contract.      The portion of the Contract dealing with the sale of vessels for a sum of  500,000 is contended by the Government as still existing and legal proceedings are pending in the matter.Arising out of the dispute between the yueenborough Company and the Disposal Board, a Receiver was placed In charge of the Port by the Court in May 1922. The result *f the working of the Port by the Receiver during the two years ending May 1984 was a loss of approximately  5,000, excluding interest on capital and Government contribution in lieu of rates.Early in the present year the Disposal Board\1-.]
decided te employ an eminent engineer to report fully on the condition and suitability of the Port for commercial needs.   He advised inter alia that if in future there is sny large industrial development in south-eastern ient the Port is suitably situated for becoming a coal-exporting Port for overseas traffic of vessels of moderate size.     He added that the Port works were in a satisfactory condition and advised that no further capital expenditure be undertaken at present. The property in Government hands consists of  200 acres of land, wharves, machine shops, sheds and buildings, cranes and equipment, railway sidings and a hutted camp.Between the rescission of the Contract and the present date, the Department has had no offer to purchase the property, but it has recently been approached by a substantial group of firms with a view to leasing the Port for a period of five years, subject to an option of purchase within that period. -The group have, it is understood, obtained mining rights over a large area surrounding Richborough and extending as far as Canterbury, and are believed to have expended a large amount of money on acquiring these mineral rights and on sinking shafts,etc.The alternatives before the Treasury appear to be either to dispose of Richborough to the group on the best terms that can be arranged or to continue to vjork the Port as a Government enterprise.     If the group acquire control of Richborough they will presumably use it as a port if their mining operations are successful But there is nothing to compel them to use Richborough if it remains in Government hands, and they can obtain
facilities at Dover, Deal or other Kent ports.     In that case the Government wo-...ld find themselves with a derelict port on their hands.negotiations with the group have reached a stage at which it is desirable to bring matters to an issue; but before doing so, 1 desire to obtain a decision on the principle involved.     My own view is that the negotiations with the group should proceed.(Intd.) P.a.Treasury Chambers, 4th August, 1924.
