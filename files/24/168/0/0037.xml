, C-JlJ  iS rnfllMSHT IS THE PROPERTY OF KIS BRITAHUIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENTS Cj B T.,435 (24). 3AIE OP GRBTMA.Report by Treasury.The Government property at Gretna which has reoently been put up for sale by auction consisted of Factories, public buildings, dwelling houses, shops, wooden bungalows and land in 5 distinct areas.   Of the factories only one has been sold, of the dwelling houses about 78 sold and 173 unsold, of the hostels 8 sold and 19 unsold, of the wooden bungalows 34 sold and 221 unsold;   of the Public buildings of various sorts 13 sold and 11 unsold.   Before the sale some 4,635 acres had been sold to the Board of Agriculture in Scotland for small holdings, and 43 houses had been sold by private treaty t6 occupying tenants prior-, to the auction.   The greater part of the remaining lend has been sold.   The unsold public buildings include the Border Hall, a Market, Cinema, Laundry, Hospital, etc   The power house and plant were not put up for auction.The sum realised is  107,716.   This represents about 8 per cent over the reserves fixed for the sold lots.The effect of the sale is. to demonstrate that at the present time there is no effective demand for Factories of the size and in the situation of the Coverataent factories at Gretna,   There- was no bid from anyone prepared to operate the factories.   This is perhaps not surprising considering their size and the fact that they were inten-tionally sited in a remote area.
In the absence of any demand for the Factories; the demand for houses must he very limited.   Access by road and rail to the Factories is fully available.A copy of the Sale Catalogue and plans showing the lots Bold have been forwarded to the Secretary to the Cabinet.paeury Chambers, 4th August, 1924-
