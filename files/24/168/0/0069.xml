[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1924.SECRET.C.P.-467 (24).MEMORANDUM. .Export of Wab Material to the Soviet Union.MESSRS. VICKERS (LIMITED) state that they have been approached by the Soviet Government with a view to their contracting to supply arms and ammunition to a value of ^67,500,000. They say that it is a firm offer, and that if they decline it the Soviet Government will go to America or elsewhere for its requirements. Before closing with the offer they desire to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government approve the proposed transaction.2. The present practice in regard to applications for the export of war material to the Soviet Union, adopted after consultation between the Departments concerned, is the following: Eaoh application is considered on its merits, and before the issue of the necessary export licence is sanctioned, His Majesty&apos;s Government must be satisfied that the quantities in question are reasonable; that direct benefit to British industry will result, and that there is no specially disquieting feature in the political situation at the moment. In no case can there be any question of Government assistance in financing the transaction, whether by the Exports Credit Scheme or other means.3. Messrs. Vickers&apos;s application has not been made a matter of inter-Departmental discussion, as a decision will rest rather upon grounds of general policy than upon technical considerations.J. R. M.Foreign Office, October 6, 1924.2442   [12124]
