[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]i circulate for the information of my colleagues in continuation of CP. 457/24, the following telegraphic correspondence which has passed between me and the Viceroy. The telegrams of the 30th September to the Viceroy were sent as the result of discussion in the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Indian Affairs.1. Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 2Sth 29th September 1924.3236 D. Your secret telegram No. 2728, dated 24th September. We strongly deprecate your decision to omit clause 1 of the original Schedule. The offences specified in that clause refer to waging war or provoking mutiny. We very respectfully suggest that the view that these offences are in any way covered by the Indian Arms Act, or are not germane to the present emergency, is illusory in so far as the waging war sections are concerned. What we are faced with in Bengal is the possibility of attempts to overthrow the Government by means of anarchical conspiracies carrying out their nefarious projects by means of bombs, &amp;c. Although we agree that the sections regarding mutiny are not at present germane to the emergency, we earnestly trust that yon will allow us to retain the remaining offences for purposes of clause 3, that is, that these offences should be triable by the special procedure provided by the Ordinance.We would also beg for reconsideration of the view that the words &quot; by threat of violence&quot; should be omitted from 12 (3) 1. The most dangerous and insidious form of attack upon our judicial system is the intimidation, by threat, of witnesses, jurors and the like. We are prepared to give effect to your views regarding the alteration of clause 12, sub-clause (2), by enumeration of specific sections, though we doubt if this is preferable to the course we originally suggested. We trust, however, that you. will not press us to omit from suu-clause (b) of what would be the second schedule offences of, or connected with, robbery, that is, sections 392 to 394, as robbery with the object of obtaining funds has, like dacoity, been one of the most frequent incidents of the revolutionary movement. Prior to the receipt of your telegram, we had ourselves recognised that clause 12 (1) was in some respects too wide, and we had prepared the following redraft: -&quot; Where in the opinion of the local Government there are reasonable grounds for believing that any person, in furtherance of any movement, the object of which is to subvert by violence the Government established by law in British India, or any part thereof, (1) has acted, is acting, or is about to act, in contravention of the provisions of the Indian Arms Act, 1878, or of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, or (2) has committed, is committing, or is about to commit, any offence intending to, or knowing it to be likely that he will, thereby, disturb by violence the public safety or tranquillity, or (3) has acted, is acting, or is about to act, with a view to interference by violence, or by threat of violence, with the administration of justice; the local Government may, by order in writing, give all or any of the following directions, namely, that such person, &amp;c.&quot;We propose further to insert in clause (2) of the Schedule, after the words &quot; to subvert&quot; the words &quot;by violence.&quot; The effect of this re-draft will, of course, be to restrict the operation of the Schedule to clause 3 and connected clauses relating to trial of offences by commission.   The Schedule will have no relation to clause 12.It will be observed that the limiting words &quot; in furtherance of any movement &quot; down to &quot; or any part thereof,&quot; will expressly govern the acts and offences specified in sub-clauses (1), (2) and (3). The action referred to local Governments under clause 12 will thus be very specifically restricted and we venture to think that the draft, so amended, will meet the requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government in a more definite and convenient manner than the alternative discussed above. We earnestly trust it will be found acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.We do not propose to communicate these considerations to the Government of Bengal till we are in a position to put the case in final and definite form. -We 7696     100  10.241st October 1924.OLIVIER.
should, therefore, as situation is emergent, be grateful for your views with the least possible delay.2. Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 30th September 1924.2759; Private- and personal. Your telegram of 26th September. I should be glad to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should understand that you do not feel yourself in a position to make, any immediate suggestion for giving effect to their keen desire that any measure; of repression should be preceded or accompanied by clear declarations and acts indicating unaltered purpose of Government of India to give- every possible scope for exercise of constitutional responsibilities nf elected persons, or whether we may hope to receive any such suggestions from you after further, consideration. We presume, from your abstention from reference to our representation&apos; of the necessity of devising some political policy which may save India from the political movement1 drifting into the revolutionary movement, that you are in agreement with us on. this point.2: &quot;In view Of necessity of calling Council in Bengal together before budget season, might&apos;it not be Well if Lytton were to endeavour to arrange for re-appoint-ment in preparation for- that occasion of responsible Ministers who would be supported by a majority hot excluding consideration of any political section as field for selection ?&apos;3. Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Home Department, dated 30t/i September 1924.Secret. Your telegram of 29th September, No. 3236 D. The question of the first clause&apos; of the original Schedule was fully considered by. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and the decision that it ought to be excluded was quite definite. It was based mainly on the ground that there is not in the situation as at present reported, or in the history of similar conditions 8 or 10 years ago, anything that without a straining of language could be described as waging war or that indicates that any attempt to wage war could be made, outside of action, not military,, but merely criminal and not extending beyond the bounds of offences contemplated in the Arms Act or the Explosive Substances Act, or in other provisions of the Penal Code. The Cabinet also definitely desired and intended, to exclude section 124a (Sedition), thus confirming what I had already conveyed to you in last sentence of first paragraph of my Secret telegram of 17th September and in my private, and personal telegram of same date, since made official.As regards clause 2 of the Schedule, your telegram appears to indicate that Your Excellency has overlooked the reference to that clause in the last sentence of my telegram of the 17th September. The words from &quot;such au offence is connected&quot; clown to &quot;safety or tranquillity&quot; are not in accordance with the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and should not remain included&apos;. If it is indispensable to have at this point some limiting phrase, I should1 not object to words: running somewhat as follows : &quot;such offence is committed&apos; by a member of, or by a person who is controlled or instigated by a member of, an association of which the objects or methods include the commission of such offences or of any of them.&quot;&apos;As regards clause 12 of the draft Ordinance,. I agree to the inclusion of sections 392 and- 394 among the offences which would justify action under this clause and to the retention of the words &quot; or by threat of violence.&quot; I appreciate also your desire to avoid a second schedule, and in order to secure this end, and&apos; at the same time to give effect to the directions already given by His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the forms of words to be used and to be avoided, I have re-drafted the first portion of the clause as follows: &quot; 12. (1) Where in the opinion of the local Government there are reasonable grounds for believing that any person (1) has acted, is acting, or is about to act in contravention of the provisions of the Explosive Substances Act,, 1908, of of the Indian Arms Act, 1878, or (2) has committed, is committing, or is about to commit any offence under any of the- following sections of. the Indian Penal Code, namely, sections 148, 302, 304, 326, 327, 329, 332, 333,. 392, 394,. 395, 3:96&apos;, 397&apos;, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 431, 435, 436, 437,, 438,, 440, 457 and 506,. or (3) has acted, is acting, or is about to act&apos; with a view to interfere by violence or by threat of&quot; violence with the administration of justice, the local. Government if it is satisfied that such person is a member, or is controlled or instigated by a member, of an association of which the
0 a v* No. 1.objects or methods include the doing of acts or the commission of offences as aforesaid or any of them may, by order in writing, give all or any of the following directions, namely, that such person, &amp;c.&quot;In order that you may be in no uncertainty, I will explain why objection is taken to (1) the phrase regarding a movement for the violent subversion of the Government, and (2) the description of one ground for segregation as the commission of an offence with the intention of disturbing by violence the public safety or tranquillity.As regards the first, it would be open to a critic to say that the phrase was clearly directed at the Swaraj political party, which aims at abolishing the present system of Government, and of which some members have publicly condemned the doctrines of non-violence, whilst it is imputed to others that they approve it. It is essential to avoid any wording which could be read, or which it can be alleged can be read, to justify the use of a Crimes Law against an openly working political party.As regards the second, the immediate object of the legislation is not to secure the public safety or tranquillity but to give effective powers to control a body of men known to have designs of assassinating Government servants and committing crimes of violence in order to terrorise non-sympathisers or to secure funds or arms or otherwise to assist those designs. Their acts may affect the public tranquillity or even the public safety, but that is not the essence of the matter; and to use a statement of this possible general result as a definition of the dangerous actions needing to be restrained is to spread the net too wide.Since drafting, above, I have received your telegram 3286 D of 30th September.4. Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State dated oOtk September 1924.3286 D. , Reference correspondence ending our telegram No. 3236 J)., dated 2Sth--29th September. Following since received from the Government of Bengal :-&quot; Action against revolutionists. Necessity for action has become more pressing. Mail arriving 10th October is likely to bring more material than that contained in Statesman newspaper and Englishman cablegrams, which will expose measures contemplated and give warning to the revolutionists, who&apos;will disperse and abscond, and we shall not then be in a position to act with effect. We desire to know by &apos; clear the line&apos; telegram whether His Excellency the Viceroy has agreed to action, and how soon the Ordinance will be ready for promulgation. Tegart is pressing for partial action followed by Ordinance, but in view of absconding and of the considerations already advanced, we wash to strike a simultaneous and effective blow. Every day&apos;s delay is now serious.&quot; We should be grateful for earliest possible reply toour telegram No. 3236 L., dated 28th instant.&apos;8&quot;
