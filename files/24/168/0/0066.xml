RESOLUTIONS REFERRED TO THE GOVERNING BODY 3Y THE 1924 QQggBBSSOS AND RESOLUTIONS ADOPISD 3T % M OOfeTOST&quot;IN THE CARRYING OUT OF WHIOH THSHTOVERKING 55BTTS-OONOBRNSDi &apos;---(a) Resolution ooncernlng Freedom of ABsoolation:The British representative will support the Director in his proposals for a further enquiry into, the position regarding freedom of association in various countries.(b) Resolution concerning representations to be made to the Separations OoomiaBloniA resolution referred to the Governing Body by the 1924 Conference aeks them to consider means of drawing the attention of the Reparation OommiBsion to the International aooial oonsequenoea following the carrying out of any programme adopted by the Commission, The resolution has special reference to hours of work, particularly in Germany.The representative will assooiate himself with the draft resolution but will, at the same time, point out, by reference to the Dawes Report, that the plan of the Committee of Experts is in no way inconsistent with the views implied in the draft resolution.    He will add that H.JI. Government would be unable to aeeooiate themselves with any representations having as their object any interference with the working of the plan which the Allied Governments and the German Government have now definitely undertaken to put into foroe as it stands, but that they have bo committed themselves in the full assuranoe that it doeB not entail any special hardship on the German workers *(o) Resolution oonoerninp relations of the Government of- the Soviet&apos;Union with the work of the Inter-national&apos; Labour Office, :This resolution pf the Oonferenoe, which waa referred to the Governing Body, expresses the hope that the Russian workers will be fully informed of the aims whioh it is pursuing and asks the Govern-ing Body to ooramunioate the resolution to the Government of the Soviet Union and to enter into relations with it by the means and methods whioh it considers moat appropriate.    The Director of the Office feelo that it is important to choose a favourable moment for entering into offioial re-lations with the Soviets and asks the Governing Body to leave it to him to suggest, when the time eeema opportune, the steps neoessary to give effeot to the resolution.The British representative will express his general agreement with the Director^ proposals.
(d) Resolution oonoerning labour...Digj3Utes:This resolution, adopted by the 1924 Oonferenoe, asks the International Labour Office to devote atten-tion in its programme of research to the question of the settlement of labour disputes and the methods employed in various countries for the organisation of conciliation and arbitration In such disputes.The British representative will support the proposal to collect information as to legislation and praotioe in.respect of conciliation and arbitra-tion and will express the willingness of the Government to supply information aB to the position in Great Britain,    In the light of British experi-enoe, he will suggest points which should be borne in mind in settling the lines upon whioh the investi-gatlon should be oarried,(e) Resolution oonpernlng, Unemployment Enquiry,A resolution adopted by the 1924 Conference ex-pressed the opinion that the researohes of the International Labour Office and the Economic and Financial Organisation would be materially assisted if each Government prepared a report on its own unemployment problem indicating the nature of any remedies proposed and added that the compilation of such a report might usefully be entrusted in each country to an authoritative Committee representative of the interests involved.The British representative will express the view that the International Labour Office, as a general rule, should not itself undertake investi-gations on a matter of this kind and that it is better that eaoh country should prepare and supply the Office with a Report on its own problem, leaving to the International Labour Office the work of compilation.    He will assure the Governing Body that, so far as Great Britain is concerned, the question will be referred to &quot;an authoritative Committee representative of the interests involved&quot;.(f) Resolution concerning, Workers1 spare time.The 1924 Conference asked the International Labour Offioe to colleot and keep up to date infor-mation concerning the use of workers&apos; spare tine, and to publish regularly studies of the action taken and the results obtained in the different countries in the application of measures whioh have for their object the proper use of the workers&apos; spare time.The British representative will explain that while, in the view of the British Government, the activities of the Offioe could usefully be devoted to the study of more practical questions, he agrees that, the Conference having taken this deoision, it
fii 9v this neoessary for the Office to attempt the work involved,    in the view of H.M. Government, however, it is very desirable that the work should be kept within reasonable bounds,(g) Resolution concerning Inoomplete delegations:Arising out of the deoision of the Oonferenoe asking the International Labour Offioe to collect all the information available whioh will enable it to form an exact judgment on the position of the Employers1 and Workers&apos; organisations in the various countries, the Direotor is proposing to make exten-sive investigations with a view to issuing a more complete edition of the International Labour Dlreotory.The British Government representative will oall attention to the inevitable deficiencies in any publication attempting to oover such a wide field as this Directory and will suggest that the proper oourse is for the Offioe to ask eaoh country to prepare an Industrial directory of its own and to supply a oopy to the International Labour Offioe.g.EXAMINATION OP THE RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE ROME EMIGRATION CONFERENCE; AS AFFEOfllKG flSE&apos;INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFICE: &quot;The Italian Government recently oonvened at Rome, under the Chairmanship of Mr. De HioheliB, the Italian Commissioner General for Emigration, a oonferenoe which adopted a number of resolutions on the subjeot of emigration and Immigration.    At that Oonferenoe the British representative (Lord Ullswater) took a definite line in support of the right of the Inter-national Labour Office to deal with emigration queo-tlons and favoured the Offioe having the work of taking action on the resolutions of the Conference and the oonvenlng of a further Oonferenoe, rather than giving these duties to a permanent International Emigration Committee established at Rome.The British Government representative will support this policy at the meeting of the Governing Body and will agree, that, if neoessary, the staff of the Offioe dealing with emigration questions should be strengthen-ed.    He will enquire, however, aa to exactly what postB are likely to be added and as to the possibility of finding the officers to fill these posts from other parts of the Offioe.A proposal that the Governing Body should appoint a permanent Emigration Committee may be made.    The British Government representative will oppose any such proposal, more particularly aB it would probably involve a permanent Chairman, who would almost oer-tainly be Mr. De Miohelis.    He will BUggest that
the needs of the Offioe would be sufficiently met If the Governing Body were to appoint a Committee who would oonsider what action was neoessary on the part of the Offioe in connection -tlon with emigration questions and would cease to exist after making its report, whioh might, however, include a reoommendation regarding the continuance of an Emigration Committee in some form or other.4.HIGH COMMISSARIAT FOR REFUGEES.The Assembly of the League appears to have adopted a proposal by its Fourth Committee which involves the work of the League in oonneotion with Russian and Armenian refugees being taken over by the International Labour Offioe, in spite of the fact that the Council of the League and the Governing Body of the International Labour Office had had the matter under consideration and had, as yet, reaohed no conclusion as to under whose aegis the work should be oarried on in the future.    The position oannot properly be appreciated, however, until further offiolal reports of the proceedings of the Assembly are reoeived and, in these circumstances, it is suggested that the British representative should be given discretion to deal with the question as seems best to him on his arrival In Geneva.6.BEPRESENTATION MADE TOPER ARTICLE 409 OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES BY THE JAPANESE SEAMEN&apos;S UNION 0OWE3IING THE GONVEl^TION FOR THE FINDING OF EMPLOYMENT FOR SEAMEN.The Japan Seamen^ Union have made a repre-sentation, in aooordanoe with Article 409 of the Treaty of Versailles, to the effect that Japan has failed to seoure the effective ob-servanoe within its jurisdiction of the Convention for the establishment of facilities for finding employment for seamen, adopted at the 1920 International Labour Conference and subsequently ratified by Japan.
The procedure for dealing with a ooraplaint of till a kind contemplated by Artiolea 409 and 410 of the Treaty la roughly that the Governing Body 3hould oomaunioate the representation to the Government against whioh it is made and may invite that Government to make such statement on the subjeot as it may think fit.    If no statement is received within a reasonable time, or if the statement when received is not deemed to be satisfactory by the Governing Body, the latter have the right to puhliBh the represen-tation and the statement, if any, made in reply to it,The British Government representative will raise no objeotion to the adoption of this pro-cedure, but he will resist any attempt that may be made to apply the more serious prooedure oon-templated under Articles 411-415 and 417-420, whioh may ultimately involve recourse to tho Permanent Oourt of International Justice and even the application of sanctions.The British representative will explain that H.H. Government regard the strict oarrying out of ratified oonventiona in all their details aa a saored International obligation of whioh the lmportanoe oannot be over-rated, but he will maintain, should the neoessity arise, that the prooedure oontcmplated by Artioles/411  et sea., is not intended to be taken advantage of by the Governing Body of its own motion in a oase in whioh the procedure set out under Articles 409 and 410 la applicable.8.REPORT OP FOURTH SESSION OF the JOINT MARITIMEOOMlISSIOl; &apos; &apos;(a) Regulations for oargoee of wood goods.In the light of the Recommendation made by its Joint Maritime Oommission, the Govern-Ing Body, without passing judgment upon the merita of oertaln draft
rules drawn up by the International Shipping Oonferenoe regarding cargoes of wood goods, authorised the Director to communicate these rules to Governments with a statement of a reservation made by Miss Bondfield, the representative ef the British Government at the Twenty-first Session of the Governing Body,   with two abstentions   , the Joint Maritime Commission at its Fourth Session adopted a resolution regretting the circulation to the various Governments of Miss Bondfield&apos;s reservation, expressing the view that such circulation might tend to prejudloe the impartial consideration of the matter by Governments and asking that Mies Bondfisld&apos;s statement might be remitted to its Sub-Oommittee on Deok Cargoes for examination and report - the Sub-Committee&apos;s observations being oiroulated to the Governments to whom Miss Bondfield*s statement had been sent.The British Government representative will take the line that the Deok Cargoes Sub-Oommittee, composed of renres.representatives of Employers and Workers only without Government representatives, is not a suitable body to whioh a reservation by a representative of H. M. Government should be referred.   He will explain that the draft Regulations have been oarefully examined by the Board of Trade&apos;s teohnioal officers and that the Board propose shortly te refer the-matter to the British Merchant Shipping Advisory Oommittee. When this Committee&apos;e views are available - and it is hoped that this will be at no diBtant date - the British Government will forward its observations to&quot;the International Labour Offioe.     in the view ef H.M. Government, neither the Joint Maritime Commission nor the Deck Cargoes Sub-Committee should be oonvened to oonsider the question again until the information that the British Government will be able to contribute, with the information whioh will doubtless be contributed by other Governments, is available.7.     AGENDA OF THE 1926 CONFERENCE.The British Government representative will press strongly for an investigation to be made by the international Labour Offioe as to the standard of wages and other conditions of labour in the various oountries, with partioular reference to the question of methods of fixing minimum wage rates, in order that in the light of the report of that investigation a deoision may be taken as to the inscription in the 1926 Agenda of some subject relating to the improvement in the oonditions of labour of the workers such as &quot;the method of fixing   minimum wage rates&quot;.He will also press for the inolusion in that Agenda of &quot;the prevention of industrial aocldents&quot;.He will support also the inclusion in the Agenda of maritime questions.   As regards the question of hours of work for seamen, he will suggest that the Governing Body should take a provisional decision at their forthcoming Session to lnolude this subject in the 1926 Agenda, leaving a definite conclusion to   be reaohed in the light of the result of the negotiations now taking place between the Governments, ship-owners and seamen in various oountrleB,
He will not objeot to the inscription in the Agenda of -i,    international Seamen&apos;s Oode;ii.    System of insoeotion for the Mercantile Marinefill.    Proposals for dealing with sertain Anthraxquestions (suggested by the 1924 Oonferenoe);but he will not actively   support their inoluslon.p.   reoord of the meeting of the correspondence committee on Industrial kygiEnb.-&quot;The British representative will take the line that the Governing Body should take no aotion at its next Session regarding the Report of the Correspondence Committee on industrial Hygiene, Blnoe it is known that the proposals contained in that report require further consideration and   revision.   The Committee reoommended that before the report on medioal inspection waa issued, proofs should be submitted to a limited number of experts of different countries for correction.   The representative will propose that these proofs should be Bubmitted to Governments as well.October, 1984.
