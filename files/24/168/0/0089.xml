DOCtMKffi? .IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERMUKHT. ], 6 4P.Jl9 (24J.. CABINET., Copy No..        y*j1, There Is one point in connection with the sugar beetsubsidy which tfas not mentioned at the Cabinet yesterday and that is whether there should be ah express stipulation in the Bill that the contracts for plant or machinery required for any new factories must be placed in this country,2. No such stipulation was mentioned in the announcementmade by Mr. Snowdeh last truly, and I am-Informed that the Dutch group which has made arrangements for the erection of -a new sugar factory at Ely are proposing to equip it with second-kaffiS machinery from a dismantled factory -in Holland.5c The arguments in favour of such a stipulation are:-&apos;(a) that a principal object of the subsidy is to promote additional employment and that the provision of the machinery for new sugar factories would materially relieve unemployment in the engineering industry.(b) that it is most desirable that the subsidy should be employed to build up a new British Industry In all respects and that it is most important to encourage the training of British technicians on the engineering side of the industry.(c) that it would be consistent with the general policy of the Government to require that State assistance should be coupled with such a stipulation, as has been done in&apos; the case of grants for the relief of unemployment and guarantees under the&quot;Trade Facilities Act.
(d) Lord Weir, the Chairman of the Anglo-Scottish Sugar-Beet..Corporation, is strongly in favour of the Insertion ofsuch a stipulation in the Bill. 4, On the other hand it might he contended that it would beregarded as a breach of faith to introduce a new condition at this stage, which was not proposed by the last Government, and that its insertion in the Bill would result in the Dutch group withdrawing from the development of the industry.    On this point, I feel that -the Government must claim full liberty to revise the scheme if they think fit, and though it is conceivable that the Dutch group might withdraw, it does not seem probable in view of the value of the subsidy.    It might be, however, that a stipulation that British machinery must be used would cause delay in the completion of the Ely Factory in time to deal with next year&apos;s crop,5. It may also be contended that British manufacturers haveno experience of beet sugar machinery and that their costs would be much higher than Continental firms.    British manufacturers are, however, highly expert in regard to cane sugar machinery, much of which is equally applicable to beet.    It is probably true that British machinery might cost at least 10$ more than foreign machinery.6, On the whole, I have come to the conclusion that in viewof the fact that the industry is being developed by a generous Government subsidy, there ought to be a stipulation that not less than 75$ of. the cost of the machinery and plant for any new Factories must be spent in this country.    This will allow an ample margin for any special cases in which a particular piece of. machinery may have to be obtained abroad.7. As it Is urgent that a V6ry early announcement should &quot;bemade on this point, I shall be glad If any of my colleagues who dissent from the conclusion stated above, and would wish to consider the matter in Cabinet, will communicate with me not
later than Tuesday next, the 18th instant.    If they do not dissent, I shall assume that they concur in the recommendation I ras&amp;e in paragraph. 6,S.P.L.W.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 13th November, 1924 *
