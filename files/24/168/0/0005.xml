SSYiiR^I______TIDAL   POWER   ENQUIRY.Memorandum; by the: Secretary of the Department of Scientific anQ&quot;rInduetrlal*^legeareh.1.     The memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and the minister of Transport, together with the report of the informal Committee appointed by Mr.Webb, shows that the scientific and economic investigations necessary as the preliminary to formulating a scheme for the erection of a barrage on the Severn call for the co-operation of five government departments, the Admiralty, Ministry of Agrictilture and Fisheries, Board of Trade, Ministry of Transport and Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.     I suggest that the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which is the scientific adviser of &quot;the Government especially in relation to industrial investigations, and which is equipped with experience and machinery for co-ordinating the scientific work of the various departments of State, is likely to supervise and direct the necessary preliminary investigations more effectively, rapidly and economically than a specially constituted commission.     Some of the expenditure on staff and the feas proposed to be paid to the Commissioners would be saved if- the Department undertook the work, while its relations with the other departments already exist/h   The special services concerned are:-   The Hydrographer3 Department, the Ordnance Survey, the Division of Fisheries, the Mercantile Marine Department and the Industrial and Manufactures Department of the Board of Trade,  the Transport Ministry (Roads and Railways), the Government Chemist and the Geological Survey.
exist and are in constant operation in other fields of work. 2.     If the Cabinet decide to proceed with the necessary . preliminary investigations and to entrust the Peaearch Department with the arrangements, I suggest that in the first place a small committee of geologists and engineers be appointed in general supervision of the preliminary geological and engineering inquiries.     The Geological Survey should immediately study the formations in the nelfhbourhood of the alternative sites already proposed for the barrage..    Two leading firms of con-suiting engineers should also be asked at&apos; once to submit a joint report before the end of this year as to the possibility of constructing a barrage on one or more of the three sites already suggested, on the assumption that safe foundations exist.     It is important to recognise that, as I am. advised, the building of a barrage on the Severn would be one&apos; of the most difficult - and indeed probably the most, difficult engineering feat ever attempted. It would be far more difficult than the building of the great dams . on the Wile.3.     The next step should be to ascertain definitely Whether it is possible to find safe foundations for a barrage on the Severn at a point suitable for the purposes in view.     Until the necessary boring3 have been made it is impossible to answer this question. The experience already gained With the Severn Tunnel and the general knowledge of the geological formations in the lower valley of the Severn indicate that the selection of a possible site may not be easy.     Moreover the necessary borings will be very difficult to make.While the two investigations mentioned in 2 above were pro-ceeding arrangements would therefore be made for boring operations in the spring of 1925.     This work would not be actually begun unless the consulting engineers reported favourably rin December next.     If the report was unfavourable it would be waste of money and effort to proceed.     The&apos; total cost up to this point would/
would be (1) the cost of making soundings by the Admiraity for the use of the engineers (a snail sum),  (2) the fee,.to the Engineers (say  10C0- 150C), (3) the cost of any special plant purchased by the boring engineers (probably not heavy at this date) and (4) the delay in other work of the Geological Survey due to their investigations on the Severn.4c     If the consulting engineers1 report were promising the boring engineers would be ready to begin boring in the spring of 1925.   An earlier date is impossible because elaborate arrangements would have to be made and a great deal of special plant would be required.    It must be realised that bores have never yet been put down under the difficult conditions that exist in the Severn.   Assuming that the estimates of the &quot;informal Committee&quot; are sound the cost of this stage would be  10,000, but I am advised that it might possibly have to be greatly exceeded.    If the report of thQ boring engineers were considered unfavourable by the consisting engineers and the Supervising Committoe of the Department, it would again be possible to break off at this point with the oertainty that tho scheme was impracticable. She cost up to this stage would have beens-1924 First Stago (paras. 2 &amp; 3) say  2,000 to  2,500 1925 Second Stage (boring) say  10,000 to  15,000Total      12,000 to  17,500 5.     If, however, the results of /the boring were favourable it would ba safo to proceed with the other items proposed by the &quot;informal Committee&quot;.    The Supervising Committee of tho Department would bo enlarged so as to enable it to deal with the sider   range of considerations.    The land Survey would be made as quickly as possible, the Marine Survey in the six summer months of 1926, the model experiments would follow, and the economic enquiries would proceed. During the autumn of the present year and the first nine months of next year the Hydrographer of the Admiralty and the Ordnance Survey would be asked to prepare considered plans and estimates for their parts of the work so as to be ready to start in at the earliest date
possible if all went well up to that pointn    :Bie Board of Trade would similarly bo asked to prepare careful plans for the economic Inquiries8   At this point the Government would be committed to the full expenditure ( 50,000 to  80s000) foreshadowed by the &quot;informal Committee&quot; for their first stage of&apos;the inq.td.iy, 60     It will be realised that these proposals involve spending a year longer at the opening stages than was advocated by the&apos; &quot;informal Committee&quot; (of their report $$ 18 and 32 (4)) but under the present plan there will, bo a firm basis of knowledge at each stage before the next is entered,   A step at a time is the only eoonomical and scientific method in dealing with an undertaking which is estimated to cost twenty millions, which will at the best take many years to complete and unless approached deliberately may easily lead to great waste of money.   The proposal to control a great tidal and navigational waterway is undoubtedly the most difficult and complex problem ever put before the engineer and though it is of the greatest interest and offers fascinating possibilities it would in the opinion of the Research Department be dangerous to approach it hastily.,July   19th, 19240
