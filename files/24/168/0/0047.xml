[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet. September 1924.SECRET.-- 39CP. 445 (24).CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON  UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 108.   Period ended August 25, 1924.THE unemployment figures given in the Table in Part I (A) of this Report show an increase since the 28th July of 100,817 as compared with an increase of 36,243 in the corresponding, period of last year. The seasonal depression which normally commences in July has thus continued but the decline has been considerably steeper than it was in 1923. The present figure, however, is lower by 136,545 than the corresponding figure on the 31st December last, and by 119,750 as compared with the figure for August 1923. It will be seen from Part II of the Report dealing with the position in the chief industries that the falling off has been most pronounced in the coal-mining industry, although some recovery in this industry is reported from Scotland. The woollen textile, engineering and iron and steel industries have suffered to some extent during the period under review, and the building trade was dislocated for the whole of the period in consequence of the national dispute. The increase of unemployment amongst women is due principally to seasonal slackness in the wholesale clothing trade, and to the depression in textile industries.T.

II.-POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES..Coal Mines. The heavy decline in the employment of colliery workers has not diminished during the month. Work has been resumed at some mines and stopped at others. Irregular short-time working is prevalent. Demands for export and home consumption give no indication of an early substantial improvement. In the North-Eastern Counties unemployment remains severe and exports continue to fall off. In the North-Western Counties orders are short, and at the majority of collieries only three or four days per week are worked. There are some indications of improvement in this industry in the Midlands, but the depression continues to have a marked effect on the volume of unemployment. In the South-West, Bristol pits are at a standstill on account of a wages dispute, and work is very slack in the Somerset and Forest of Dean coal-fields. The coal-fields in Scotland, with the exception of the Lanarkshire field, report improvement during the month, both for shipment and for the home market. In Wales the general position has shown no sign of improvement, and at the end of the period under review further stoppages at collieries were anticipated.Stone Quarries.-Employment generally remains good.China Clay. There is no change to report. Employment is good in the skilled occupations, but only fair amongst unskilled labourers.Iron Mines. The employment position continues bad. Further mines have closed down in the Barrow area.Tin Mines. The slow improvement in the Cornish tin mines continues.IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION.Severe depression continues in this industry. Although slackness is expected at this season of the year, the decline which has continued during the month appears to be more serious than last year. In the Cleveland area quotations in pig iron have taken a downward turn and have reached lower levels than at any time since August 1922. At Rotherham large iron and steel works have closed down in consequence of a trade dispute involving 5,000 men. At Sheffield the month&apos;s output of steel was considerably less than the output for the corresponding period last year. Producers of open-hearth steel report a continued decline in buying, both on home and export account, and only a small number of furnaces in the district are working. The rolling mills and forges are less active with the exception of those engaged on the production of iron and steel sheets in which considerable overseas trade is being done. Depression is very pronounced in the North-Western Counties. In the Midlands the general decline continues. There has been slight improvement at Newcastle-under-Lyme, and the trade dispute reported last month affecting 2,000 workmen at Bilston has been settled with a consequent large reduction of the live register at the local Employment Exchange. The position in Scotland is very bad. In every branch of the industry business has been reduced to very small dimensions. In Wales the position in this industry is not so serious as in other parts of the country. Temporary stoppages have occurred during the month in South Wales iron and steel works, but in many cases work has been resumed.TIN-PLATE TRADE.The employment position generally remains very good,SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The steady improvement reported during the last few months has not been continued during the period under review and the tendency has been in the direction of increased unemployment. Reports from the Tyne, Wear and Tees districts show distinct depression. Contracts in hand are nearing completion, and workmen are being discharged as new orders are not forthcoming. On the Mersey-side trade was exceptionally quiet and new work practically at a standstill. At Barrow additional men were engaged during the month and some men from the Mersey-side obtained employment at the Barrow yards. The general position remains poor in the London shipyards. . Unemployment increased during the month at Southampton and Woolston owing to the completion of contracts for repair work, and at Bristol owing to a trade dispute. In the smaller ports of the South-Western Counties the shipyards
are fairly busy. In South Wales a trade dispute between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Shipbuilding and Repairing Association is having a serious effect upon the ship-repairing industry. , Repair work is being diverted to other ports as much as possible, with the result that unemployment has increased in Bristol Channel Ports. Scottish shipyards report a decline in employment owing to the completion of large contracts. Orders obtained during the month have been generally for smaller vessels and opportunities of employment have diminished appreciably. At Montrose, however, larger contracts have been secured for immediate execution and the position there has improved.ENGINEERING.Motor and Cycle Engineering. The employment position generally remains fairly good. In the main centres of the Midlands seasonal depression was more pronounced than it was last month. Considerable increases in the Live Registers at Birmingham, Coventry and Sparkhill are due mainly to suspension of workers in \ the motor-car, motor-cycle and cycle trades.- At Nottingham, Dudley and Wolverhampton some firms are still busy. In London and the South-Eastern Counties there were signs of increased activity during the month mainly in connection with light cars. On the other hand, the North-Western Counties report decreased trade in light cars and increased production of heavy motor lorries. In the South-Western Counties the motor trade remains good and activity at Oxford and Basingstoke has shown a tendency to increase. Aircraft works at Bristol. Woolston and Yeovil are busy.General Engineering. The employment position remains bad, and reports from the main centres of the industry indicate that the slow improvement which has been shown for some months has not been maintained during the period under review. In London and the South-Eastern Counties there has been no appreciable change on the whole. A fair level of employment appears to have been maintained in the South-Western Counties, although the position was uncertain in the railway works at Svvindon. No alteration of importance occurred in the Midlands. Trade continues firm at Beeston, Chesterfield, Basford, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Darlaston and Wednesbury. At Nottingham, trade improved in hosiery machinery, but textile engineers at Long Eaton were only -fairly well employed. Slight improvement is reported from Birmingham, but in the surrounding area trade was stationary and the prospects were uncertain. Employment was moderate in Wolverhampton. Skilled machinists were well employed at Coventry, and at Rugby and Newark little unemployment existed in the industry. In the North-Western Counties slackness continued in locomotive engineering and textile engineering. Makers of gas-engines and electric plant were fully employed. In the North-Eastern Counties the lathe and tool trade was quiet, but good orders for textile machinery for Japan were put in hand at Leeds. Railway wagon works experienced a further shortage of orders, and makers of colliery plant continued to suffer from the depression in the coal-mining industry. Some new contracts in constructional engineering were obtained at Stockton and Darlington. No change is reported from Scotland. In South Wales and at the Bristol Channel Ports generally marine engineering was dislocated owing to a trade dispute, and the state of the coal-mining industry still affected general engineering and iron founding. The position in South Wales is, on the whole, much the same as&quot; was reported last month.TEXTILES.Cotton. Although no change of importance occurred during the month there has been a tendency towards improvement and the outlook for this industry is said to be brighter. With the prospect of more abundant supply and cheaper cotton, there is a likelihood of increased activity, particularly having regard to the fact that stocks are almost depleted. The Egyptian (fine spinning) section continued very active, but organised short-time working remained in force in the American spinning section. A slight improvement was noticeable in the weaving section of the industry and more looms were running than for some months past. Makers of fancy^goods continued to meet with a fair demand, and increased activity was displayed in the manufacture of medium plain goods. The Yorkshire cotton centres reported further depression during the month.Woollens and Worsteds. During the month there has been a further increase in unemployment, due to a steady depression of trade rather than to any sudden^
fluctuations. The prices of the various classes of wool have been maintained and the lower qualities have been in greater demand. Higher-grade cloths have had difficulty in finding a market. The decision of the Japanese Government to increase heavily duties on certain classes of imports has affected the position of fine worsted manu-f acturers in the Huddersfield area, whose products will come within the scope of the additional import duties. The importation of French piece-goods to this country continued to increase during the month.Hosiery. The employment position generally remained bad, and there have been signs of further slackness in the trade during the month except in the Nottingham district, where some activity has been maintained.Lace. Unemployment in this industry continued to be severe on the whole, but during the month the position was somewhat eased at one or two centres. Trade was depressed at Basford and Newark, and, although still bad at Long Eaton, showed a decided improvement there. Slight improvement was reported from Ilkeston, and at Beeston there was a partial resumption of work in the curtain section. At Nottingham the position fluctuated considerably, but has been relieved to some extent by a large Government contract for mosquito nets.Silk. The month under review is usually marked by seasonal depression in this industry, but the employment position is, on the whole, fairly good, and prospects for the autumn season are said to be good. The artificial silk section of the trade remains very busy.Jute. No change of importance is reported. Fair activity continued, but there is a considerable surplus of labour in this industry.Carpets. -Trade at Kidderminster was normal and the employment position generally remains good.BUILDING AND BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.The national dispute in the building industry reported last month terminated on the 23rd August and work was generally resumed on the 25th August, the last day of the period to which the present report refers. It is understood that, with exceptions in a, few districts where operatives declined to accept the terms of settle-ment, the resumption of work on the 25th August was as complete as could be expected after a stoppage of this kind. Skilled men experienced but little difficulty in obtaining work even if they were unable to resume on their former job, but the dislocation caused by the dispute undoubtedly led to increased registration by unskilled building trade operatives.The brick-making trade was quiet during the building trade stoppage, but the brick-yards are now busy again. Tile-making remains normal, and fire-brick manufacturers were fairly well employed.CLOTHING.The employment situation reflects distinct seasonal depression both in the wholesale and retail branches of the trade, but on the whole employment is fairly good.BOOT AND SHOE.Employment generally remains poor. Most of the Midland centres report con-tinued depression and! increasing unemployment. The situation, at Northampton, however, improved slightly and trade was fairly good at Wolverhampton. In London the tendency towards depression continued except in the light-dress and dancing-shoe trade. At Norwich trade continued good. Marked improvement occurred at Kingswood.POTTERY.Employment remains slack on the whole. It was good in the tile sanitary earthenware and fire-clay trade and fair in the general earthenware branch, lneie is still a demand for labour in the porcelain section at Worcester.
7331DOCK TRANSPORT.There is no important change to report in the general employment position in this occupation. Fluctuations/occurred during the month at various ports. In London work generally was quiet and was affected to some extent by the diversion of fruit ships on account of the dispute at Covent Garden. Improvement occurred in the position at Southampton and particularly at Avonmouth. At North and South Shields and Hartlepool dock workers were well employed as the timber import season was at its height.

Expenditure by Poor Law Authorities, A (England and Wales) B (Scotland).These Statistical TaMes have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance.

- Unemployment Insurance. (Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance, against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a: week for women,; with 2s. (instead, of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may.be paid during unemployment subject.to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the, disqualification for benefit in the case of, persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the ,right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to August 30, 1924.Expenditure     Benefit paid &apos;     ...&quot;     ... ....   171,114,000&quot;;      &quot;-Appropriation for Administration ....    15,749,000Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;c. &apos; ....      2,130,000188,993,000Income-: Contributions-Employers .... .... .....    64,086,000Employed.............    58,260,000Exchequer........ ....    42,155,000Exchequer (for ex-Service Men)     ..... 2,927,000167,428:000Interest (Net)....        ....        ....      - .... -   949,000Balance of Old&apos; Fund at Armistice (excluding -   Interest accrued) *-Employers         ....        .... -      .... 5,825,000, Employed          ....   -    .... 5,825,000Exchequer         .... &apos;      .... &apos;    &quot;... 3,884,000- &apos;---    15,534,000Loans from Treasury (Net)....         ........ 4,700,000Miscellaneous-             .-                     ; .

These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by^ providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account [e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.\: Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.
