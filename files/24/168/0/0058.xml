pjyifiTIitBNT IS THB PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSTY&apos;S GQVaKiffl&amp;iT. ;Q g jCABINET. Disarmament and Arbitration Protocol.       &amp; Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty,I think it advisable that the Cabinet should realise that the Admiralty view with some apprehension the Disarmament and Arbitration Protocol which is being prepared at Geneva.The Admiralty have not had the time, nor indeed, the opportunity, to consider the progress of the various drafts of this protocol, and do not yet know the actual form in which it will be presented to the Assembly, probably on Monday, the 29th September; there are, however, oertaln points in the documents which they have seen, which they think should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet.The document by whioh the British Delegates may bind this nation is of grave importance and merits serious and detailed consideration being given to all its implications.   It is the more important that the details of the articles should meat with the approval of H.M.Government, and that amendments should be inserted at this stage, as amendments at a later stage may jeopardise the whole procedure regarding the suggested disarmament conference in June, 19.25.   If the Assembly endorse the protocol as drafted, and at a later stage amendments are pressed for, it would appear probable that these amendments must come again before the Assembly, which norr^lly does not meet till September,1925aI therefore mention certain points which require early consideration, and on which the Admiralty feel apprehension. 1. Although it has been asserted by Mr*Henderson at Genevathat Article VII really deal3 with economic sanctions only, yet that article (of which a copy is attached) contains the following undertaking:-&quot;And for this purpose the Signatories undertake&apos;,jointly and severally to take all measures in their power to preserve the safety of communications by land and sea of the attached or.SECRSTi. .P.N0.456/24.
Whatever may be the Intention of tho- Negotiators at Geneva, that Article,.as it stands, is bound to be interpreted as requiring Naval measures, as by Naval measures alone can the safety of sea communications of a threatened State be safe-guarded; to he effective, the Naval Forces must operate within reach of the Naval Forces of the Aggressor State, and thus he open to attack by tho Aggressor1s Forces, though legally no state of war exists *     This is a false situation in which to place the Navy, a situation which can only be regularised by a declaration of war on the aggressor State previous to such Naval operations.Again Mr* Henderson&apos;s statement that Article VII does not . involve Naval measures is directly contrary to the first lines of Article XI which refer to tho contingent Military Air and Naval sanctions provided in Article VII.   This matter should bo cleared up and not left to be interpreted by the Permanent Court at some later date-The question at issue is really whether the economic sanctions that could be applied are regarded as being effectual without the use of the Navy, or only effectual with the use of the Navy, and It must be remembered that the Navy has no rights of visit and search or control of commerce except in v/ar-   Navies only aoqulro international law rights of action from the fact of belligerency,It is noticed that a reservation has been made in Mr Vendors on&apos;s speech both as regards the proposed obligatory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court and as regards the compulsory arbitration, to the effect that disputes arising out of warlike operations undertaken by tho British:Empire in support of the leagu shall not be referred to the Court for settlement, or to the Arbitral Borlye   This reservation does not cover the whole field; it should also apply to warlike operations undertaken by the British Empire that yt&amp;&amp; not forbidden by the Covenant or Protocol as for instance resistance to aggression, and possibly war against a non-member.&apos;(The.....
(The position vis-a-vis non-raeittber-3 of the League is not tooclear as it la governed by Article XVII of the Covenant, butthis case would at least appear possible namely, that if we hada dispute about our reserved rights in Egypt with a non-*Statemember of the League and if the non-State member did not acceptthe decision of the Permanent Court that the matter was a domestic matter to the British Empire, we should be involved In awar with the non-State member).References occur in various Articles indicating that theCouncil will arrest the movements of Naval Forces or impose anundertaking that the signatories will not proceed during a certainperiod bf any measures of military, naval, air, industrial or economic mobilisation, nor generally to any action of a naturelikely to render the dispute more acute or more extensive *   Thereis also an undertaking that the Signatory States will abstain from any act which might constitute a threat of aggression against another State.The Admiralty cannot be content with the above provisions unless It Is specifically understood that nothing in these Articles shall preclude a movement of the. Fleet in self-defence.-, e.g. tho inability of the Fleet to move to a strategic position might involve the destruction of the Empire.   It also appears ,that an accelerated provision (or delivery) for supplies of all sorts might be regarded as violating these clauses and that we would be regarded as guilty of an infraction of the Protocol and this by two-thirds majority of the Council.   Further, although aggression has been flefined in the Protocol it seems impossible^ to define what Is a threat of aggression.There are othor points in relation to the Protocol on vdiich the Admiralty feel doubt, but I will not labour   them now.   I presume that the   document will be referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence for examination and.report.(Intlld)   C*ADMIRALTY.   ,27th September. 1924.-
COPY.AEiTCL.3   7tAs soon as the declaration of aggression has been ratio  and the outlawry of tho aggressor has been effected by this declaration, the obligations&apos; of the contracting Powers in regard to the sanctions of all kinds mentioned In paragraphs 1 and 2X of Article XVI of tho Covenant will immediately become operative in order that such sanctions may forthwith bo employed against tho aggressor^Those obligations shall be interpreted as obliging each of tho Members of tho League to co-operate loyally and effectively In support of the Covenant of the League and in resistance to any act of  ggresslon.In accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant the signatories give a joint and &quot;several undertaking to come to the assistance of the State attacked or threatened,and to give each other mutual support by means of facilities and reciprocal&apos;exchanges as regards supplies of raw materials and foodstuffs of every kind, openings of credits, transports and transit, and for this purpose to take all measures in their power to preserve the safoty of corranunications by land and by sea of the attacked or threatened State.If both parties to the dispute have been declared aggressors according to the above provisions, the economic sanctions will be applied to both of them.x   Original text of the Covenant.
