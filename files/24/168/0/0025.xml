Private and Confidential.

My dear Olivier,

I enclose herewith copy of a very confidential letter from letter respecting the revolutionary movement in Bengal. Undoubtedly the situation depicted by him is grave and the interview I have had here with Tegart confirms this view. Before discussing Lytton&apos;s  proposals it became obviously essential for me and my Government to receive the official representations of the Bengal Government with all relevant reports and documents and more precise indications of the powers sought. Neither I nor my Government could promise support or make recommendations  to you without full official information. The matter is far too serious to be dealt with otherwise than officially. We therefore communicated our views to this effect to the Bengal Government by telegram requesting them to address us officially and with the relevant documents. We are awaiting compliance  with this requirement. I also wrote a Confidential letter to Lytton appreciating the gravity of the situation and the difficulties confronting him and his Government. I explained also that we could not give assurance of support of particular measures until we had better information and that we could not act on the statements of Tegart, although I esteemed his oral representations to me of very great value. Generally I informed him that I should of course give the utmost consideration to the views of himself and his Government and with the earnest desire to be of assistance, but I could go no further at the moment. There the matters stand for the present.  It is right that you should know at once what is 
happening and further that I should, open my mind with the utmost freedom to ycu with the reservation that I am awaiting fuller details before coming to my own Conclusions and placing the matter before my DomicileTegaf t has added one detail of great importance to the measures proposed in Lytton&apos;s letter.     Hie Bengal Government?s plan is to introduce a Bill after being armed with an ordinance by the Governor General under seet072 of Go of I,, Act to be promulgated upon.the introduction of the Bill and to be continued until the Bill has beoome an Act,     22ae object is to prevent persons from dispersing and covering thoir tracks etc. pending the discussion of the Bill in LogoCouncil,     It is beyond disputo that the Bill will be rejected by a large majority,, and it is anticipated that Moderates and other Indians will support Swaragisto and very few, if any, Indians will vote for it,     The Governor proposos then to certify tho Bill-So far as my information goes, based upon Tegart2s statements to me, the Bill will be on the lines of the; ill-fated Hewlett Act and will give widely extended pavers beyond those under Beg oil I of arrest and detention, including segregation of individuals in specified villages.     I view these proposals with grave anxiety,,     I leave aside genera]; principles to which you and I and doubtless Lytton subscribe, with conviction forbidding the arrest of any person without trial.     These principles require no elaboration: but we have had to depart from thorn in the special circumstances and. have made and are making use of Reg,,IIIo     I fully appreciatei tho difficulties of yourself and your Government in defending this departure,,     How we are pressed by reason of more acute danger to go further and to enact a now law of repression of far-reaching importance,,     She Bengal Government naturally Seeks to protect its police offioers and citizens against
 murder, it has to meet a secret ruthless organisation financed as described by Lytton. The element of financial assistance is of utmost value to the movement and enormously increases the difficulties of the secret police. In the past, want of money led to ?cities and the police had thus better opportunities of ascertaining the participants in these crimes and thus the members of the Rev. movement. Again I gather from Tegart that by reason of retrenchment, his staff has been much depleted and at a time when in truth it should be increased.    Thus the information otherwise obtainable is comparatively meagre although one must have the greatest admiration for Tegart and his associates for all they have been able tee accomplish hitherto and in the face of these murderous plots directed against them.  At present Government has Regulation III; a number of leaders have been interned and at first it was thought that this measure might supply the needed instrument additional to the ordinary law. But the recent powerful assistance mentioned by Lytton has, in opinion of Bengal Government, changed the situation and it requires extraordinary measures. Tegart and I understand Lytton and his Government think these would give beat elements of success because good results were achieved (during the war) against these Revolutionaries under the Defence of India Act (similar in scope to the Defence of the Realm Act). I am very doubtful, as, during the war, little attention was paid to liberty of the subject as hitherto understood. Press was censored, attention was concentrated on the war. Nowadays there is already serious unrest and political agitation against Government and British raj, there are legislatures and Press is free. Two points thus emerge, first, will the Act, if passed, succeed?  and again, will it not cause a general uniting of Indian politicians and a recrudescence of
the kind of agitation that characterised events after the passing of the Kcwlatt Act, and which will s pread throughout India,     I am wondering whether an Ordinance and a certified Bill may not have effect of carrying the movement to other parts of India.     I do not wish to discuss these matters in detail, my object is mainly to give you indications of my present line of thought,,     Repression is in my opinion of no avail unless it can be carried Out without constant discussion and explanation and justification. If every act can be questioned and debated according to the ordinary law, the repression tends to become paralysed and is not effective.  &apos; The repression under Kef. of India Act succeeded because it could be used drastically, - the exceptional circumstances that alone can justify such repressive laws are the justification for their comprehensive use?     fo-day repressive laws will not move an inch without the territory being surveyed and the movement questioned, pilloried, condemned as outrages etc     I am doubtful as to its success as I see it at present     One further point. GoVoGeneral&apos;s Ordinance onoo promulgated will lead to agitation for discussion in legjkssembly.     If not sitting, it will ask to be convened.     If sitting, it will move adjournment and probably resolution condemning Ordinance and policy of Govt.     Members will ask my sanction to introduce measure to repeal or amend Ordinance^     If I grant it, measure will be passed by overwhelming majority;,     If I refuse it the Assembly will take probably more dramatic step and declare it is a useless and impotent Legislature.Whilst I have put three serious points for consideration I am not unmindful of the grave aspects of situation,     I propose to oonsider o::long other things whether we here can afford finanoial help to Bengal Govto (by secret service funds or otherwise) to enable them,to have more
\numerous ana effective staff, and further to oonsider whether we oan help by loan of O.I.D. officers.    Ihey might then be able to carry on with advantage cf regulation. III.    You will understand that I have decided nothing yet.Yours v* sincerely,
fii)Private and very confidential. From (Jovenor of Bengal.To   Viceroy. 26th Juno 19240Bear Reading,I am sorry to say that the&apos; revolutionary movement here is becoming more serious and in my opinion the time has arrived when it is necessary for us to obtain further powers than these conferred by Regulation III of 1818 and if we aro to suppress it effectively.   You will remember that we feared from the vory beginning that nothing short of the full powors which alone and at long last proved effective in the past would suffice to deal with the rocrudesoenoe of Bengal&apos;s revolutionary epidemic,;&apos; The new factors in the situation are these:-1.   The revolutionary movement is now being financed by CR.Das from his party funds,    Subash Bose the now Chief executive officer,  of the Corporation is subscribing Rs.1200 a month of his official salary to the Revolutionaries. O.R,Das is said, to have given them already Rs. IS, 000 and to have promised them Rs.75,000 more.   This support was extorted from him at the Sara;) gun j conference as the price of support for his Hindu-Moslem pact rosolution.   In addition the Revolutionaries are now maicing Rs.500 a day out cf the situation at TarakeshwarJ2.     As the rosult of this financial help it Is no longer necessary for them to rosort to .daooities for the purpose of obtaining funds.&apos;   The situation, therefore, is outwardly more peaceful, but in reality it is more menacing.   Bombs are being manufactured in large numbers and arms, are being accumulated.
1^31 . JL \j3,    Tegart ia now in moat &quot;imminent-,-danger-*md it Is a miracle that be has escaped so far.   On the occasion of the-reoent riot in Oaloutta when 7 Sikhs wore killed by Muhammadens in the belief that they wore kidnapping children for human saorifice 6 men were told off to assaEsintvte Tegart of Thorn 3 did not know him and were told to shoot anyone in a oar- of the pattern and colour of his own0   He was saved on that ocoaaion because he visited the district in a taxioab.   We feel that we oan no longer bo responsible for his safety and we live in fear of his assassination from day to day.4,    Surendra Mohan Ohosh, alias Madhu, is known to be tho leader and chief organiser of the assassination plot at the morenoti,but we dare not detain him under Regulation III as the identity of our only source of information of the workings of the inner oirole and leaders of the revolrtionary movement would at once be revealed if we arrested him.   Wo are sending you the history sheet of this man. 5.    Any fhrther use of Regulation III to be effective would necessitate the inclusion of well-known individuals like Subash Bose, Satyendra Mitra, possibly even C.R.Das himself. We have sent you reoently the history sheets of some of these men and I would beg you to treat these as specially confidential.   I understand that the authority to detain under Regulation III is that of the Governon-Gene ral in Council and I fie not know whether or not it is your practice to  . consult your whole, &quot;-Council in the matter.   If the history sheets are seen by the Indian members of your Council, I feel that they are more likely to be struck by the name^ of well-known politicians than by those of individuals of whose identity they are quite ignorant, and a chance remark or an unguarded reference might reveal some detail in the&apos;se
IShistory sheets ana have very serious consequences.   The need for caution, therefore , in these cases is even greater than it has &quot;been in the previous ones.   I should he grateful if you would impress this up onfall who may see them,,The situation has now reached a stage at which it is necessary for us to cast our net wider.   Without the powers of arrest and search and of segregating in particular areas the more obscure agents and followers as well as the leaders which were conferred, by the Defence of India Regulations and proved so effective in the past, wo feel that It will be impossible to prevent the spread of the movement now that it ia in receipt of funds,,   We have therefore drafted a Bill which we propose to introduce into our Legislative Council conferring upon us the powers required,    Such a Billvhcwever, has little chance of passing in the present Council and I should Toe obliged to certify it as necessary to ths discharge of my responsibilities.   I could not take such a step without the approval of the Government of India and of the Secretary of State and I propose to send Teg art at once to Simla to discuss the whole situation with you and give you all the information you may require.   He is more acquainted than anyone else with all the details. He is also a very lucid and capable exponent of a case.    We could not have a more efficient advocate, nor you a more experienced adviser.   His mission will have the further advantage of removing him temporarily from the dangers which surround him here.   If you approve, we may decide to send him subsequently to England on a similar, mission to the Government at home.I am not giving you more specific details either of the limitations of Regulation III procedure or of the terms of our draft Bill, as Tegart will explain everything to you when he arrives.Believe me,Yours sincerely, s(Sd) Lyttonc
j^C RET. I ,^ , (24) 10th ConclusionsCABINETINDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEEDRAFT CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the above Committee held in the Ministers&apos; Conference Room, House of Commons, S.W., on Monday, 28th July, 1924, at 4.15 p.m.PRESENT:-The Right Hon. Lord Olivier, K.C.M.G., C.B., Secretary of State for India, (in the Chair) .fhe Right Haii. Viscount Chelm&amp;f crd,     The Right Hon.

Trevelyan, president cf the Board cf fducation..p .,    Colonel the Right Hen. J.C.Wedgwood, D.S.0.,M.P., Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.THE FOLLOWING WERE ALSO PRESENT:-Mr. A.C. Chatarji, C.I.E., Member of the Governor-General1s Executive Council.Joint Secretary tc the Committee.V. Daws on, G.I.E., India Office
THE CHAIRMAN introduced Mr. Chatarji to the Committee and stated that the Prime Minister had asked the Committee to hear certain points v;hich Mr. Chaiarji had desired to place before the Prime Minister.MR. CHATARJI said that speaking for himself and in no way as a representative of the Government of India, he thought that if a further advance in Reforms was contem-plated it would be necessary for His Majesty&apos;a Government to arrive at a prior understanding as to the question of the Defence of India - the future of the Army (British and Indian) under reforms.     He personally thought that the proposals which he had seen advocated of a sort of Dyarchy in the Central Government) involving the transfer of most subjects to Ministers responsible to the Assembly, but the retention of Defence in the hands of the Governor-. General, would be unworkable, since it would be impossible to separate the finance &quot;of the Army from the finance of other matters.He was aware that a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence two years ago had gone very fully into the question, but he thought that that Committee had taken insufficient account of the promises of eventual self-government which had been made to India.LORD CHELMSFORD observed that the task of that Committee had been to consider the Defence of India In the circumstances then existing.MR. CHATARJI also urged that the next revision of Reforms should involve the widening of the franchise both for the provincial Councils and for the Assembly - or
possibly a revision of the system of voting such as the&quot; giving of the vote to a whole village collectively.He ventured also to express the view that Parliament and Parties in this country should Interfere ae little as possible with matters entrusted to the Indian legislatures: for Instance, that India should be left to take Its own line in industrial and social legislation, and not be pressed from here by the Trades Union Congress or otherwise.(Mr; Chatarji then left the Committee).The Committee then discussed the points which Lord Chelmsford should take in the adjourned debate on India in the House of Lords on July 29th.In the course of the discussion, LORD CHELMSFORD urged that in order to secure expedition In dealing with the Lee Commission^ Report, it should be suggested to the Viceroy that in preference to the usual methods of examination departmentally and by correspondence, he should adopt the procedure of Lord Chelmsford&apos;s Government in dealing with the Report of the Industrial Commission.     In that case a Secretary to the Government of India was deputed to visit each local Government and obtain a full statement of their views in discussion and subsequently Sir T. Holland wa3 sent to London to place the Oovernment of India&apos;s views before the Secretary of State - thereby securing very speedy-decisions.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.TS.1. gSth July. 1924.
Draft Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy.Your letter of 9th instant re Bengal conspiracies for outrages dlsoussed by Cabinet to-day.   ..e desire to express our deep sympathy with yourself and Government of Bengal in your anxious and difficult situation and in your recognition that conspirators1 activities are approaching a point at which some energetic and drastic action may have to be taken to disarm them. But we recognise equally with yourself the extremely disastrous situation that would be likely to be produced by adoption of the policy of the Rowlatt Aot, and we share your grave anxiety as to the proposal whioh it is indioated may be made.   All your arguments in justification of this anxiety commend themselves entirely to us, and we trust that you will find yourself able to deal with the situation by some effeotual means without resorting to measures whioh would probably result in entire destruction of any hope of ordered progress and development of constitution of India.    If financial assistance to Bengal Government is required, we hope you will find yourself able to afford this in suffloienoy.
Government recognise that when the Committee of &quot;&quot;-enquiry into constitution has completed its labours, which they trust may be accelerated as vigorously as pos ;ible, it will be necessary to consider very carefully what action shall be taken upon their report, either within the Act or for the purpose of considering possible revision of constitution.   They feel that they cannot satisfactorily and ezpeditiously deal with these questions without personal oonferenoe with yourself, and they think this would be best effected if you could come on leave for that purpose before the meeting of the Indian national Congress, if possible, and in any case in time for you to return to India well in advance of the January meeting of Assembly.   Please let me hear what you consider possible in this connection.-13-
