?01w u i.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Pi1 HIS BRITAHMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.3SCRET. CP ,427/24.CABINET. The Future of the British Empire Exhibition.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of overseas Trade.I circulate herewith to the Cabinet a memorandum which I have had prepared in regard to the future of the British Empire Exhibition.2.    The main points are as follows:     It appears ?probable that there will be a deficit at the end of the present year of perhaps  1,500,000*   The guarantee fund amounts to  1,700,000, of which His Majesty&apos;s Government will be responsible for  600,000 as soon as the Guarantee Bill now before Parliament has gone through.   The guarantors, therefore, will have to put up probably almost the whole of their respective undertakings.    They are entitled to be recouped rateably out of the proceeds of realisation of the assets, but it is impossible to say what the assets will realise, and it is quite possible that the amount available for recoupment may turn out to represent only a very small percentage. 3.     Should the exhibition continue for a second year, the figures in the statements annexed to the memorandum suggest that the deficit might be reduced to somewhere about  1,000,000, but this is necessarily a very speculative question dependent upon the extent to which the enthusiasm behind the exhibition is maintained.   Such a result does not perhaps sound very brilliant for the risk involved, but on the other hand a loss of  1,000,000 spread over two years&apos; working is.a much more satisfactory outcome than a loss of  1,500,000 spread over one year&apos;s working. 4-    It looks as if there will be a strong public demand for continuance of the exhibition, supported probably by the wholepress/
press, and on the other hand, if it ia closed in October, it seems clear that there will be a considerable outcry when the financial results are known, both from the guarantors and from other critics, especially in view of so large a loss having been incurred as against only some six months&apos; enjoyment by the public. 5.    Continuance also has Its complexities:   for instance, it appears that the guarantors might claim that they were ipso facto released from their obligations; and though they might be invited to agree to go on, the process of obtaining agreement would be full of difficulty.   His Majesty&apos;s Government would probably have to take a much larger share   of     responsibility in the management of the exhibition, which might well be embarrassing, and possibly in its finance.    On the other hand, it may safely be said that the exhibition has exercised a most beneficial influence upon unemploy-irent and would continue to do so both in the coming winter and after it had been reopened.6. 1 I do not suggest that the question is yet fully ripe for decision.     I only bring it forward now as I understand that this may be the last meeting of the Cabinet for some time, and it seems very undesirable that so important a question should be left over for hasty decision within three or four weeks of the closing of the exhibition.     I should be inclined to suggest that a committee of the Cabinet might be set up with power to   deal with the matter and take decisions.   In the meantime enquiry might be made through the Colonial office as to the attitude of the Dominions, and the views of the exhibition authorities themselves could be obtained in more definite form.     At present I have only had a general talk with Lord Stevenson, and we do not know what the views of the exhibition authorities are as to the eventual loss this year, the probable financial results of continuance, the best line of action in relation to the guarantors, and-other matters.31.7.24.

Messrs. whinney Smith &amp; Bhinney, the auditors of the British Empire Exhibition, have recently furnished Xloyds Bank with a report on the financial position and prospects of the exhibition. Attached to their report is a schedule containing a series of estimates of the possible deficit at the date of the closing of the exhibition on the 31at October, based on a aeries of varying hypotheses.    She most probable estimate would seem to lie aonie-where between  1,250,000 and  1,750,000, and perhaps  1,500,000, may be taken as a working figure.2.    Colonel Cole, Director of the Exhibitions Division of the Department of Overseas Trade, has supplied (see Statements I and II attached) an estimate of what might be the result if the exhibition were carried on for another year,    His calculations are based partly on figures at his disposal as a member of the . Estimates and Finance Committees of the British Empire Exhibition and partly on the report of Messrs. Whinney, Smith &amp; Whinney. He assumes an expenditure of  250,000 for reconditioning, but on the other hand calculates that there should be a considerable reduction next year in the cost of maintenance.    iflie experience gained/
-8- 9 a ahi u agained this aeaaon should make for economy, and the auditor a1 report also suggests that the present ataffing ia on the extravagant aide and that lack of financial control haa led to avoidable expenditure.    Aa regards revenue in 1925, Colonel Cole allows for a falling off of two-thirds in the renta paid by exhibitors for space since it might be necessary to charge much lower rates than those of thia year, and for a falling off of one-third in the receipts from admissions, conceasiona, etc.    Thia latter figure is necessarily speculative. The exhibition would have the advantage next year that it could be ready - and would be known to be ready - for whatever date might be fixed for opening:   its attractions would al8o be better known overseas where the publicity this time waa undoubtedly defective.    On the other hand tendenciea in thia country might be leas favourable.    It is perhaps doubtful whether firms would a second year be prepared to spend considerable sums in sending their employeea, or whether public spirited people would be able to subscribe as freely as has been the case thia year in so many centres for helping large numbers of children to visit Wembley;   or again, those who have had some difficulty in scraping together the money for a visit thia year, might well hold back another time.     m other words it ia conceivable that the enthusiasm behind the exhibition might have waned.    It ia not suggested that this will necessarily occur or even that it la likely, but it ia a riak which haa to be taken into account. 3.    On Colonel Cole&apos;a basis next year&quot;a working ahould result in a favourable balance of some  400,000, so that-the net result of a second year might be to reduce the deficit from somewhere around  1,500,000 to somewhere around  1,000,000.    Thia perhaps does not sound a very brilliant result for the riak Involved on the other hand a loss of  1,000,000 spread over two years&apos; working is very much better value for money than a loss of 1,500,000/
 1,500,000 spread over one year&apos;a working.     It ia safe to prophesy that there would be a formidable public outcry at the magnitude of the expenditure and the extent of the loss for an exhibition which had been open only a little over six months. 4.    It ia only fair to add that the exhibition authorities would probably regard the figures given above as unduly       . . pessimistic.    ? he Chairman of the Finance Committee ivaid the other day at a meeting at the Department of Overseas Trade that the deficit this year would not greatly exceed  500,000, and that a second year&apos;a working would remove any risk of ultimate loss,   fie Duke of Devonshire in an article in a special supplement of !Ehe fimes published this week foreshadows even a possible surplus in the event of continuance next year. But one cannot find any justification for such forecasts in Messrs. Whinney&apos;s report.(2)   The Guarantors. 5.    The total amount of the, guarantee fund ie, in round figures,  1,700,000, of which His Majesty&apos;s Government, when the guarantee bill now before Parliament becomes law, will be responsible for  600,000.    The guarantee form provides that the deficiency (if any) is to be ascertained within 12 months of the closing of the exhibition, but that the guarantors are entitled to have the assets realised on their account and to be recouped rateably from the proceeds.    Lord Stevenson, in conversation the other day, said that he has heard of a syndicate which might be prepared to pay  600,000 for the assets as they stand.    Such an offer might or might not materialise:   if it did, the guarantors, having first been called upon for nearly the whole of their guarantees, would subsequently have about 2/5tha of the total amount returned and distributed among them. On the other hand there might be grave difficulties about finding a purchaser for the assets which are somewhat of the &quot;white elephant&quot; order. *&apos;
6.    In one respect the guarantors&quot; position Is unusual.   When -guarantors are called upon after an exhibition It is generally, or probably always, because the exhibition has.been more or less a failure in Its appeal to the public;   in this case they would be called upon for a very large proportion of their total guarantee although the exhibition has been in this respect a notable success.   The fact is that by the time the exhibition was opened it had beoome impossible to earn the amount of the expenditure in the limited time available before it would have to be closed again in the autumn.   An estimate was supplied by the Board of Management of the British Empire Exhibition dated 1st April, 1924, in connection with the present guarantee bill, in which a balance between revenue and expenditure was shown by taking as a basis a figure of 50,000,000 visitors.   30,000,000 visitors In the 27 or 28 weeks for which the exhibition was to remain open meant an average of over 1,000,000 per week or close on 200,000 per day.   From the figures used by Messrs.Whinney Smith &amp; Whinney it would appear that the average daily attendance in the first ten days of July, when the exhibition was In full swing, was some 133,000 and we know that the figures, still sometimes drop below 100,000.   On the other hand to get an average of anything like 200,000 over the whole period of the exhibition, it would be necessary that after the first few weeks the figures should be averaging usell over that amount in order to make up for the inevitable slowness in starting.7. &apos;  The fact is that the conception of the exhibition widened greatly as time went on;   and the question of the&apos;possibility of recouping   the growing expenditure assumed a lesser importance as against the desire to comply with ever-increasing demands for space. This was natural enough, but it will afford a legitimate cause of grievance/
9^7*6egrievance to the guarantors, who will probably say that they came in with the reasonable expectation that the exhibition was to be devised on lines whioh would have given them at any rate a run&apos; for their money.   When for example the campaign for guarantees was initiated it was officially announced in the circular inviting contributions that the Government would guarantee  100.000 if an additional sum of&apos; 500,000 were secured from other sources, but that it was hoped to secure at least  1,000,000, statements which afforded little ground for anticipation that the eventual expenditure on construction and maintenance up to the opening day would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of  3,000,000.   To tell the guarantors that they have helped to produce a magnificent show and one which has been of enormous value both to this, country and to the Empire as a whole, will perhaps be not wholly satisfying to them.   It seems practically certain also from the tone of the auditors&apos; recent report that their final report will contain comments on lack of financial control, which may give rise to unpleasant recriminations.   Attempts will probably be made to place responsibility upon His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Technically this contention could be rebutted, for His Majesty&apos;s Government have always insisted that the exhibition is being run by private enterprise, and their powers under the Guarantee Act are limited to approval of the Executive Council and of the General Manager, and to the right to demand information.   If, however, there is an outcry against the present administration, it will probably be said that the Government were responsible for its creation, and though the Board of Management was technically appointed by the Executive Council, it must be admitted that, as everyone knows, it was the outcome, both as regards its constitution and largelyas/
&amp;&amp;^regards---its personnel,, of Sir William Joynson Hicks 1 inquiry into the administration of the Exhibition.8,    The guarantee question affects a large number of persons of all classes.   Apart from the Government^ guarantee there are only two guarantees of  100,000 or over, one that of Sir Robert MoAlpins &amp; Co., the contractors to the exhibition, for  150,000, and one of  100,000 by Lloyds&apos; underwriting members.   Then there are a certain number of big companies who have guaranteed  10,000 or  5,000 and the list tails out with 448 persons who have guaranteed  10 or less,   Probably when the position is known to those conoerned they will form some sort of association to protect their interests, and there is a good deal of danger in view of the preceding considerations that there may be serious trouble.     It would be deplorable if the exhibition were to end in a welter of recriminations and possibly even in litigation. 9.    If, on the other hand, the exhibition is continued for a second year, Messrs.Slaughter &amp; May, the solicitors to the exhibition, have advised that the guarantors could probably claim that they were released on the ground that they came in on a one year basis;   and any uncertainty on the point would no doubt make Lloyds bank refuse to continue.   It would be possible to circularise the guarantors, putting the position candidly before them, and asking them whether they would be willing to go on, but it is doubtful whether satisfactory results would be obtained by this method,   A certain proportion would presumably take their chance of getting out.It/
Xt would then, on the faoe of it be neoeseaxy-to^oolrvula^       209 the others again, since the disappearance of some of their colleagues would mean an Increase in their liability, and it is not clear where the process would end,   It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that If the exhibition is to be carried ori) His Majesty&apos;s Government may have to assume responsibility for the whole guarantee fund.   On the other hand, it hardly seems fair that the guarantors should g3t out altogether. They might perhaps be tempted to go on by an offer that their liability, whatever the eventual loss, should not exceed a fixed proportion of their Original guarantee.   The difficulty of getting an unanimous consent would remain, but the unpleasantness of their existing position (when they realise it) might prove a not ineffective inducement.10,&quot;   If His Majesty&apos;s Government became the sole guarantor, their maximum liability by the time the exhibition was re-opened in 1925 would be in the neighbourhood of  2,000,000 (i.e,  1,500,000 deficit on 1924 plus  250-000 for reconditioning plus  180,000 for maintenance during&apos;the winter .   At the close of the exhibition in October 1925, the Government would become to all intents and proposes the owners of the exhibition^ assets; that is, they could either demand their immediate realisation in reduction of the deficit before making the deficit good to Lloyds bank, or could retain the assets after repaying the whole amount of the deficit to the&apos; Bank.11.     It should perhaps be added that even if* the exhibition is not continued, there is likely to b6 muchpressure upon the Government to come to the relief of theguarantors and also to save the exhibition property being.summarily disposed of at any price which could be secured.The guarantors, as has been already stated, are entitled to be recouped out of its realisation;   and the likelihood of a price being obtained in any way commensurate with the vast sums expended on the exhibition-;&apos;is, perhaps, negligible.A/-
A Bale to some syndioate at what would be regarded as a knock-out price would be likely to arouse much popular indignation throughout the country and also possibly in the Empire overseas, (3), The Dominions, India and the Oplonies. 12,  Much necessarily depends upon the attitude of the Dominions, India ana the Colonies.    it is understood that the Board of Management have been sounding the High Commissioners through Sir James Allen, who is a member of the Board, and that the results do not show enthusiasm for continuance.   It is possible, however, that the Dominion Governments might take a different view.   It is difficult to believe that the Exhibition Commissioners in charge of the Dominion pavilions will not be reporting favourably upon the results achieved this year. Dominion produce, such as fruit, etc, which has to meet severe competition from the United States and other foreign countries, has secured a magnificent advertisement;, and it is said thatHPgood results have also been obtained in relatinn to landv settlement, especially in attracting the class of settler most required, the man with some capital.    If His Majestyfs Government are prepared to help the exhibition to carry on for another year, the best course would appear to be that they should address Dominion Governments directo    It is not unlikely that these would be influenced in their decision if they were   ;, given a larger part in the management of the Exhibition, through the British Government itself assuming a larger responsibility^ in it (see heading 5 below),13,   It is understood that the Government of India hav-e already cabled that they think it would be useless to incite provincial Governments to support the exhibition for a second year, but their attitude might be modified if the Dominions decide to go on,
911W X -2-(4) Exhibitors in the j^j-acgjjf Engineering and the Palace of Industry14.&apos;   It seems not unlikely that a good proportion of the existing exhibitors would be prepared to go on if they were offered some inducement in the way of lower charges.   The question was raised at a recent meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade, and the Committee were practically unanimous in favour of the exhibition being carried on for a second year.   The members took this view not only having regard to the interests of British trade and industry as a whole, but several of them also In their capacity as exhibitors.   It seems probable, too, that there would be no difficulty in filling the places of those who might drop out. If, however, there should be any large amount of space available, especially in the Palace of Engineering, it might be worth considering whether the railway companies should not be asked to consider forming a special exhibit in celebration of the centenary of the opening of the first British railway in 1825. A railway exhibit is always attractive, and a special show of this kind would supply a new feature in the exhibition.(5) Future management 15.     If the exhibition continues, it has been suggested in the earlier part of this memorandum that His Majesty&apos;s Government will have to take a larger financial responsibility, and it follows almost of necessity that they will have to have a different relationship to the exhibition authorities from that of this year.     The House of Commons is almost certain in the .circumstances to insist upon the Government having financial control, which in its turn will involve a large share   in the responsibility for the administration.   The system this year has/
has sometimes been embarrassing to the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, and exasperating to the Department, but it has often proved extremely convenient.   Perusal of the parliamentary questions of the last few months shows that criticisms of the exhibition have been constant, multifarious and frequently unreasonable, and to be able to reply that the Government have no power of intervention has been not without Its advantages.   It is Impossible not to foresee many difficulties if the Government should have to assume effective control.   There will be constant pressure for improvements, for reductions in charges and, so on, whioh it will be necessary to resist in the  -interests of finance.    Especially there will be difficulty over the granting of the new concessions for catering, amusements and many other items which will be necessary owing to the lapse of the old contracts in October.    Nobody likes monopolies but unfortunately no exhibition can be run without handing over many matters of this kind to concessionaires. This is especially the case with catering, and the question is complicated by the dominant position in the catering industry of Messrs.Lyons, who are proYtbly the only firm in the country capable of handling business upon ao large a scale. On the other hand, as has been suggested above, the fact of the Government having a share, and possibly a dominant share, in the management would probably facilitate working with the Dominions.(6) Influence on Employment, 16.    Shortly before the opening of the British Empire Exhibition this year, the exhibition authorities estimated that 19,000 persons were being employed at Wembley, and it was suggested that for every one employed within the exhibition ten were being employed outside.     If the exhibition is continued, work this winter would, of course, be on a much smaller scale, but a very large proportion of the  850,000 estimated for the cost of reconditioning(espocially road-making) would go in wage 3/
wages, and there would also be the expenditure of the Dominions and other exhibitors to be taken into account.   It was estimated at the same time that the numbers which would be employed In the exhibition after opening, including employees on exhibitors&apos; stands, employees of concessionaires, etc. would amount to 21,250.   The actual figures &apos;could no doubt be obtained from the exhibition authorities.    There is also the indirect effect upon employment through the stimulus given to trade, railway traffic, etc the extent of which it is impossible to estimate, but which must certainly fce very important.(7), Conclusions^17.   It should be explained that this memorandum has been prepared under pressure and without direct consultation with the exhibition authorities; there may, therefore, be inaccuracies-, and there are almost certain to be expressions of opinion with which, from their much more intimate experience of the exhibition, they would wish to differ,18,   It is not easy to make any positive or confident recommendation, but on the whole tho balance of advantage seem to lie in attempting to secure a second year&apos;e working, from a purely financial standpoint,His Majesty&apos;s Government would probably be well advised to let tho exhibition close in October, pay up their share of the guarantee, and cut their loss.   But it is clear that finance is not the only factor to be taken into account.   It would be a deplorable thing if the exhibition after the magnificent success attained were to end in an unpleasant atmosphere of bankruptcy and its concomitant recriminations; such a result might well undo much of what the exhibition has achieved as an educational instrument and in stimulating a reasoned imperial sentiment.   Intervention by the Government would appear to be the only way of avoiding .   1* such/
such a disaster, and if there is to be intervention, it would seem better that it should take the form in the first instance of helping the exhibition to run a second year.With the experience which we have in the Department   ofiexhibitions and their uncertainties, we should hesitate to venture in any way upon prophecy, especially in this case where the speculative element is enhanced by the enormous scale of the whole enterprise, but it would seem at least as if the exhibition could hardly fail to pay its way in the course of the second year.   In that case the financial position at the end of the second year would not be worEe, and might..&apos;well be better, than that at the end of the first, while the public would have had the benefit of the exhibition for twice as long.   This should do much to allay popular irritation and to silence charges of mismanagement which, however   unjust they may be, arc certain to begin flying about if an onormous deficit has to be met after the public have had only a little over six months&apos; enjoyment of the exhibition.     Lastly, there is thy stimulus which a great undertaking of this kind necessarily gives to employment, both through its direct demand for labour and from the influence which it exorcises upon trade, and railway traffic.DF^ARTMEM OF OVERSEAS TRADE, 31. 7. 24,
