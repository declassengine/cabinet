DOCmiB?TT IS THE PROPliRTY 0? Ill3 BRITANNIC i7^STY&apos;S QQVfflMKHT).3^CABINET, /UMBK PLOYS J3KT COIa ITTKV. REPORT OH TJNEIIPLOYI-VEFr GRANTS, COMMITTEE RATES OF GRANT,it    At their Meeting on the 30th June, 1924 (Cabinet 44 (24) Conclusion 2) the Cabinet, by a majority, approved in principle the proposal that the grants made by the Unemployment Grants Committee to Local Authorities should be increased from 65^ to 75$ of interest and sinking fund, charges for Non Revenue Producing Works; from 50?&apos; to 60;&quot;* of interest charges for Revenue Producing Works; and from&quot;60^ to 75$ of the wages cost for works financed otherwise than by loan and referred the matter to the Unemployment Committee for further examination in the light of the above decision,2,    The Unemployment Committee are informed that on reconsideration. the Minister of Health is doubtful as to the necessity or desirability of increasing the existing rate of grant in the case of Revenue Producing Works.   The Committee concur in this view and recommend that the present rate - 50$ of interest charges - should be maintained for Revenue Producing schemes.   The following paragraphs are therefore concerned only with schemes of Non Revenue-Producing Forks and Works aided on the wages cost basis,3,     The Unemployment Committee consider that the only other question remaining to be settled is the date on which, and the extent to which, the increase in the remaining categories of oases is to become effective, in order that the Unemployment Grants Committee may at once iscue the necessary circular to Local    &quot; u Authorities&apos;111&apos; 436 (24),
4.       It is obvious that all schemes submitted after the date of the public announcement of the new terms will benefit and that the simplest course would be to restrict the benefit of the new terms to such schemes, or possibly to schemes approved after that date.-5.     Such a course would t.owevcr be manifestly unfair to those local authorities who in spite of&apos; their financial burdens responded at once &apos;*nd whole-heartedly to the Government&apos;a Circular of the 27th February last and submitted, without delay schemes for the summer of 1924 and the winter 1924-5 on the existing terms. 6,     It would moreover be injudicious from the point of view of future programmes (should such be necessary) as it would put a premium on delay in putting schemes forward. 7.     It is suggested therefore that the preferable course would be- to make the new terms applicable to all schemes (other of course than Revenue producing dahemes) put forward in response to the Unemployment Grants Committee&apos;s Circular of 27th February, for whioh purpose it would be necessary to adopt some such arbitrary date as 2nd Inarch, 1924 for the dividing line.Ho doubt hard cases will arise and attempts may be made to take unfair advantages; to meet this it is suggested that the Unemployment Grants Committee should be authorised to use their discretion, subject to observance of the broad principle of division indicated above,
9,    The Unemployment Committee invite the Cabinet to take note of and approve the following Conclusions unanimously reached by the Committee.(1)   That in the case of Revenue Producing Works the present authorised rate of grant (50fe of the interest charges) should remain unaltered and r,fcat to this extent the Cabinet should reconsider the decision contained in Cabinet 44 (24) Conclusion 2a.(2)   That, the Unsmplpyment Grants Committee should be authorsced to pay grants at the new rates (nou Revenue Producing Works: 75$ of interest -and sinking fund charges.
