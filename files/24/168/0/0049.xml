THE SITUATION   1,    THE CHAIRMAN referred to the telgrems x IS BENGAL.to and from India subsequent to tha laBt meeting of the Committee held on September 9th, and to the draft of the Ordinance received from the Government of India which may also he introduced aa a Bill into the Bengal Legislative Counoil,MR. TREVELYAN expressed the opinion that tho Bill need not be criticised aa it resembled other Crimes Bills.    He considered, however, that there was a great principle involved;   the class of crime in question is political orime and any legislation proposed is advocated as a means of dealing with a political party.    He was not prepared to ooeroe without making an attempt to deal with the, politioal situation out of which the crime arises.    In his view the Prime Minister and the Cabinet should oonsider the question.    He himself would definitely object to the Ordinance unless acoompaniod by an attempt at conciliation.    He would not say that the Ordinance was unnecessary, but he considered that the action might be used against the Swarajist leaders.COLONEL WEDGWOOD agreed with &amp;r. Trevelysn that conciliation must accompany ooeroion, and desired that the Viceroy should be instructed to direct Lord Lytton to offer office to Mr. C.R. Pea and to Dr. Moored.THE&apos; OHMRuAN dissented in view of the information available connecting Mr,* Das with the movement of the promotion of revolutionary orime.LORD CHEL5MF0RD agreed with the Chairman, MR. WEBB  was of the opinion that the/terms of the Ordinance were too wide?   he would giveeIegramS&quot;aiid despatches&quot;datlng from July bist to September Uth inclusive, including a draft Crimes Bill, etc, are reproduced in Cabinet Paper CP. 446 (24) whioh will be circulated shortly.
unlimited power to se&amp;rch for btmbe and deal with conspiracy for violent r*m&amp;utienary aotieh but other parts of the Ordinance were, he eoneidtred, e*Ject4^ee le.LCRD OHSiaiSFORD reminded tho Committe* of the very great care with whioh power to be given by the Ordinance was used when it existed under the Defence of India Rules and referred to the resolution of the enquiry, by Mi Jm * Beacheroft and Chandravarkar.THE CHAJBlttJNT oonoidered that this revolutionary movement oauld not bo identified with the Swaraj party though  seme individuals might beleng to one of the two revolutionary societies and to the party, and the., party might help the eooiety with funds.    The revolutionary societies were localised in Bengal. He read the following passage from a private letter whieh he had reoeived from the Viceroy dated 28th AugustThere seems politically no difference of view between you or the Cabinet and me upon the proposal for emergency legislation for Bangui.    There may be an occasion in the immediate future when we shall be called upon to put eur principles to the test.    It is impossible to doubt that it might become seoesB-ary to have recourse to wholly exceptional measurest and I do not suppose for one moment that the Cabinet or you would oppose the reoourse to them if you were satisfied that ordinary measuree and even extraordinary measures te the extent now available to us [suoh as Regulation ill) have completely failed to prevent outrages or break up the movement.    The retjl question will be whether or not the faots constitute an emergency Justifying the recourse to such measures.    This is a tjuestien *tf degree&quot; upon which it may &apos; well be that the Bengal Government may seek this from special powers when neither we nor y&amp;u may be convinced that they are necessary. Naturally the man on the spet, rliving in the atmosphere and constantly hearing representa-tions favouring recourse to exceptional measures, may prom-nm^a in favour of them, when we, fu^iriior  removed from the scone ef action but nevertheless with knowledge of all the local Conditions as reported by the local Government ;
may refuse to acceot such recommendation, I imagine that if I and my Government were convinced that special repressive measures had become essential for the preservation cf crcler, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not oppose us, although I can well understand the embarrassment this policy would cause to a Labour Government,       But after all it would have the justification that this action w?:s necessary to support the Viceroy and his Government and to give reasonable security to the people of Bengal..s0.;,&quot;THE CHAIRMH pointed cut that the meaning of theViceroy&apos;s telegram cf September llth appears to be thatthe emergency   hich makes it necessary to issue an Ordinancegiving these special powers is now imminent, that the Viceroyexpects the support of His Majesty1s Government and expresseshis opinion that it would be right to give such supportindependently cf political considerations and as a necessarystep for enabling the Government to deal with crimes of violence.     He considered that His kajesty&apos;s Government.was bound to support the Government of India when they decided that the    emergency exists,(The Committee after further discussion adjourned until 2.30 in the afternoon.)At the adjourned meeting held at 2,30 p.m3 on the 15th September, it was decided that the Secretary of State should write a letter to the Prime   Minister recommending that the te]fgram of which a draft is appended should be sent to the Government of India.     Some members of the Committee desired that there should be added to the telegram an intimation on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that it was considered extremely desirable that if the Government of India should be called upon to invest the Government of Bengal vrlth special powers of the character contemplated there should at the same time be made some definite indication of the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to make some liberal advance on constitutional lines, and. possibly some declaration/making
making it perfectly clear that the action taken was aimed not at the Swarajist or any other constitutional political movement, but solely and exclusively at the revolutionary organisations which have for many years past existed in Bengal and which are now showing renewed activity,COLONEL WEDGWOOD maintained his suggestion-that such action might be taken in the form of a suggestion to the Viceroy that he should consider the propriety of causing Mr, Das and Dr. Munshi to take o.. f ice as Ministers in Bengal and the Central Provinces respectively.2, Whiteha11 Gardens, S, W,1, 15th September, 1924e
to I.    .Draft OJelegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy Dated_______September 1924.In view of defects in ordinary law, H.M,&apos;s Government prepared to authorise enactment of legislation, or, if required, issue of ordinance-giving ample powers including search, arrest, temporary imprisonment or segregation, intended to prevent crimes of violence, where breaches of Explosives or Arms Acts, or definite concerting or attempting physical violence or assassination of any person whatever are suspected.    But they would exclude from scope of legislation mere sedition ox-provoking class enmity or other offences consistent with exclusively political action.They therefore object to the $revision of Section 12 enabling the Governor to use powers against persons acting &quot;in furtherance of any movement the object of which is to subvert the Government or to disturb by violence the public safety or tranquillity&quot;, which they consider far too wide.    Section 12, should, in their opinion, run, &quot;is shout to act in breach of the Explosives Substances Act or Arms Act, or is definitely concerting or attempting physical violence, murder op assassination&quot; in lieu of words &quot;in furtherance&quot; down to -&quot;tranquillity&quot; and in following sections of draft ordinance they would substitute &quot;offence&quot; for &quot;movement&quot; (of the mature described in section 12).     Similar changes of wording will be   necessary in clauses lb, 18, 19, schedule ( ) and possibly elsewhere.
Telegram from Secretary of State for India to the Prime Minister, The Hillocks, Lossiemouth, dated 15th September, 1924.Cabinet Committee and India Council sat to-day am sending you draft of telegram to Government of India proposed, but this was agreed to by some Members of Committee subject only to conditions which must be considered by you   or by Cabinet.   &apos; Am writing by to-night&apos;s post. Olivier.
9 fibQ y JCOPY Oii&apos; lilTTBR FflOM SS01JSTA3Y 05&apos; STATE FOl^ IHDll&apos;TO THE 3?RBiE&quot;MIlISTEH; .INDIA OFFICE,Whitehall, s.W.lo 15th September, 19 4.My dear Prime Minister,The Cabinet Committee on Indian Affairs considered this morning the action to be taken in regard to the Bengal Criminal conspiracies.Since the papers were last before you, a further telegram (in three parts) dated 10th September which is the last in the blue papers herewith, has been received.The first part of this telegram (paras. 3 and 4) gives all the reply that we have to your note of the 12th instant as to the apparently rapid develop-ment of the situation.I enclose a memorandum of the proceedings in the Cabinet Committee and the draft of a telegram which it ?;as agreed should be sent;    the main purpose being to restrict the operation of the special powers absolutely to the repression of crime and not to give a loop-hole for allowing them to be used against seditious or politically revolutionary movements.I had a meeting of my Council after the Committee meeting and they concurred in this telegram but advised that after the word &quot;attempting&quot; there should be inserted the words &quot;or inciting to or conspiring to attempt&quot; - physical violence etc.   I think these words are unobjectionable and may be an improvement to the telegram.I desire/
I detsiro to call your attention to the quotation which I made from Heading1s private letter received this morning (page 2 of the Minutes of -the Committee.) and to the last two paragraphs reporting what passed at the adjourned meeting.Wedgwood sad ffrevelyari were in - favour of making the proposed addition to the telegram;AWebb, was neutral and Chelmsford and myself dissented, my ground being the following.Whilst I agree in thinking it extremely desirable that we should be able to make some indication of our liberal constitutional intentions, it seems to me idle to tell the Viceroy that we&apos; desire to do so with-out telling him what kind of promise we can make; end equally idle to ask him-for suggestions..   He will simply reply that he is proceeding as quickly as possible upon the lines we have approved as preparatory to the consideration of constitutional advance; whilst as regards Wedgwood&quot;s suggestion in view of the fact that he and lytton have definitely informed me that they have evidence whioh satisfies them that Das has been encouraging and financing the new activity of the conspirators, I really do not see my way bo inviting him to ask Das to take- officThe Assembly having voted against the Lee Report, will undoubtedly bring us more deeply into difficulties and it may he that this would by itself/
o P V-f K * ft O U aitself produce a situation in which we should be bound to take some now departure in overhauling the Government of India,   Beading told mo that Blackett has himself not been in favour of the Leo Commission Report, but had advised a complete overhaul of the Indian Government establishment with a view to running it on a less espensive scale; and I cm bound to say that this seems to me a more helpful line of action than the mechanical enforcement of the lee Commission recommendations.But my immediate point is this, that I do not think we can refuse to consent to the special measures recommended, restricted as proposed in the draft telegram, until we are in a position to couple them with some definite authority to the viceroy as to an announcement of the intention to meet the demands for further reform;, and I do not think that it is at all doairable so . closely to associate repression of crime with concessions to the Swaraj movernento   I have dono all I can to insist that the two are quite distinct,   She Bengal conspiracies have beon going on for the last 20 years*Troveiyan definitely stated that he would not consent to any repressive legislation unless accompanied by some definite liberal act,    I enclose a copy of his rec ommend at i on.If you concur, I will despatch tho telegram   as drafted and amended by my Council; but the question of any promise of constitutional advance cannot, I think, be decided without a Cabinet Moeting, and you may think it necessary to take the opinion of the Cabinet as to whether the telegram as drafted should be issued before the question of such a promise has been dealt with,I will immediately prepare a general memorandum for the Cabinet on the position of matters in India.Yours sincerely OLIVIER.
-10-Mr.Trevelyan&apos;s opinion.While ready .to consider a measure intended to give to the Government of India powers to search for arms and explosives, the Committee regard the assent of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the enactment of the Crimes Ordinance as   inadmissible unless accompanied by some definite act which will make it clear to the Indian people that His Majesty&apos;s present Government are ready to co-operate with them in working for Indian self-government and that no v.ssent be given to the Ordinance without the authority of the Prime Minister and Cabinet vdisn the concurrent polioy of conciliation can be considered0
