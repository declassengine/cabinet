I circulate for the information of my colleagues, in continuation of CP. 469(24), copy of a telegram from the Viceroy of India. I concur in the views expressed as to the difficulty of meeting the suggestion made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. They correspond with those I have put forward myself in the Cabinet and in the Committee on Indian Affairs, and are precisely what I should have expected to receive from the Viceroy.OLIVIER.8th October 1924.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 8th October 1924.Private and personal. Further reference your private and personal telegrams of 22nd September and 30th September. As the Reforms Enquiry Committee has not yet reported, I no not qnite understand your urging upon me the further necessity for devising, without delay, some political policy which will save India from political movement drifting into revolutionary movements. I have already explained that the revolutionary movement is anarchical, and that its members are irreconcilable, and no action that the Government can take will placate them. I have further explained that the Swarajist party, as a whole, has neither adopted the revolutionary policy nor, so far as I am aware, become connected with it. I do not believe that Nehru and his associates approve of violent revolutionary methods. C. R. Das, as I have already explained, has made use of Bengal revolutionary movement for his own purposes. Doubtless some of the Bengal Swarajists are connected with the Bengal revolutionary movement, but, from all the information before me, they are not the majority of the party.2. The revolutionary movement is at present confined to Bengal, and if unchecked might spread its activities elsewhere, but I see no evidence, and have received no information which would indicate that so far the movement has spread beyond Bengal.3. It is highly inadvisable to make any declaration of future policy which has not been thoroughly considered as expressing the definite intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India until the Reforms Enquiry Committee has reported. I do not feel justified in giving any indication of future policy I may advise beyond what I have already said to you in my private leiters and telegrams. I realise the Cabinet&apos;s desire that repression by means of Ordinance should be accompanied by declarations and acts which would appeal to the Indians commanding majority in Councils. But I feel strongly that indefinite declaration of policy for the purpose of placating majorities in the Council would at present do harm and not good. Any declaration of such policy made at the moment of issuing Ordinance might, and in some quarters undoubtedly would, be regarded as the consequence, direct or indirect, of criminal conspiracies and would, I fear, be used for the purpose cf encouraging their continuance. It is well known that Reforms Committee is about to conclude^ the evidence and to consider its report, and no political party expects any pronouncement until the report has been received.4. This telegram, read with my private and personal of 26th September, gives you my views on the points referred to by you. From these you will perceive that my difficulty in accepting, as it stands, the immediate policy urged by you in your private and personal No. 2696 of 22nd September is that I am convinced that it would be highly inadvisable to make any such declaration of policy as an accompaniment of the promulgation of the Beugal Ordinance.5. Lord Lytton has sent me copy of the memorandum he has forwarded to you showing why, at present moment, there is no reasonable prospect of constituting a new Ministry. I agree generally with his conclusions. Meanwhile the situation in Bengal will be carefully watched.Printed for the Cabinet.      October 1924.SECRET.CP. 472(24).Situation in Bengal.
