Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I have before me a case relating to the eviction of the widow and family of a prison warder from Government quarters at Wormwood Scrubs prison which involves a question of principle&apos; affecting other Departments as well as difficulties in connexion with the expenditure of public money and on which I find it necessary to invite the opinion of my colleagues.The husband died on the 25th January.   On the 11th February the widow, was told that she could have until the end of the month in which to vacate the quarters.    She then pleaded that she was unable to obtain alternative accommodation but was hoping to obtain it at Plymouth.   On tho 18th March legal notice to give up possession on 1st April was served upon her.   On the 5th April she was told that if she did not soon vacate the quarters the Prison Commissioners would have no alternative but to apply to the Court for an Order for possession and hoped she would be able to give up possession within the next fortnight.   On the 15th she said she could not vacate and asked for another month;    the Commissioners replied that they would delay action for a further fortnight.    In May the papers were sent to the Treasury solicitor and on the 28th May the Court granted a Warrant for possession after 28 days.   More than twice this period has passed and ehe is still occupying the quarters;    and the Commissioners represent that, having failed to induce her to leave by this pressure and threats of legal action lasting over 6 months, they see. nothing for- it but to enforce the order of the Court unless 1 feel that I can give special instructions in the matter.   Pressure is still being maintained, but we must, I fear, acknowledge that it is not now likely to succeed and decide before the Recess what action is to be taken if she does not now leave.,jjig document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)OJ^EJI. CABINET. &quot;^Cj, 4-18(24). ,EVICTIONS, FROM PRISON QUARTERS.
The grounds on which it is suggested to me that the law should now be allowed to take its course may be summarized as follows :-(1) Government quarters are provided at prisons at the public expense in the public interest in order that the authorized strength of prison officials may be in a position to carry on their duties efficiently;    and it is not right that prison officers should be forced to live away from the prison in order to allow the families -of warders who have died or retired to continue to occupy the prison quarters.    This is in fact specifically recognised by Parliament which has given special powers for dealing with this situation in the Prison Acts.*(2) Considerable hardship is involved to serving officers who are forced to live away sometimes a considerable distance from the prison and who, although they draw allowances for this on a fixed scale are not really compensated thereby for the increased expenditure, in-conveniencej and social separation from their comrades at the prison.(3) The continued payment of lodging and travelling allowances when Government quarters could be. made available involves expense to the Exchequer, is outside Treasury authority, and is liable to severe criticism by the Public Accounts Committee, to whom the Prison Commissioners could produce no valid defence unless they are in a position to say that the Secretary of State has specifically instructed them to refrain from enforcing the order of the Court and to continue paying the allowances until they can secure possession of the quarters without proceeding to eviction.(4) If the Government give countenance to an impression that they are not prepared to allow evictions even in a case like the present they will defeat their own object, as evictions will ultimately have to be resorted to in cases where the threat of it would have sufficed.On the other side there is the fact that the present Government is specially liable to criticism if it authorizes evictions from its own property, and particularly 30 when the evicted parties are the widow and five young children of one of the Government&apos;s own servants.A.
