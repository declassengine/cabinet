this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.,P.-Tgrpi)CABINET.British Dyee&apos;. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade, / eferenoe Cabinet 4S (24) Conclusion 67-After the Cabinet Meeting I saw Mr. mckenna and he thought there would be no difficulty in arranging suoh an undertaking on the part of the British DyeBtuffa Corporation as was suggested at the Cabinet.   I afterwards communicated to him the following draft with the suggestion that something on those lines should be made the substanoe of an agreement between the Corporation and the Government or incorporated as a proviso in the Memorandum of Association.&quot;The Corporation/ shall not Itself or through any subsidiary Company enter into   any agreement with any foreign interests conoerned in the manufacture or distribution of dyestuffs whioh shall have or be likely to have the effeot of subjecting the Corporation/ to foreign control, or of restricting unduly the production of dyestuffg, or the range of dyestuffs produoed, or the prosecution of research in dyestuffs ohemlstry, by the /0orPora&apos;bio l7 in tIie United Kingdom, or of imposing any undue restrictions or conditions upon the supply of dyestuffs to consumers in the United Kingdom and the British Empire.&quot;I ought to say that I think it may be found eventually that the solution oannot take the form of a olause in the Memorandum of Association but the form of an agreement between the Government and the British Dyestuffa Corporation enforceable in the Courts, whioh I think will be satisfactory from the point of view of the Government.   In reply to my communication of this draft I have just reoeived the following letter from Mr. MoKennas-&quot;Thank you for the draft.   It appears to me to answer the purpose and I think the Corporation might properly be
. hi X Orequested to enter into the.-agreement.   I hope very muoh that you  will he able to get a deoision next Tuesday.Thank you again for all the trouble you are taking in this matter with regard to the purchase of the Government Shares Mr. mckenna has tentatively put forward the idea that the reconstruction of British tJyestuffa Corporation might take the form of the setting up of a new Company in its plaoe, and that in the prooess the same terms should be offered to other shareholders as are offered to the Government, whioh would have the advantage of preventing any appearance of there being a special deal with the Government to its disadvantage or advantage.     This, however, is a detail whioh will have to be settled later.I should like to be authorised by the Cabinet to proceed with the negotiations upon these lines.Ml(Intld.) S.W.Board of Trade. 1st August, 1924.
