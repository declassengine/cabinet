H E T. 74(84).CABINET.OPIUM.Farther Memorandum by the Secretary of State for tho Colonies.ft o o o o c o(Previous Paperst CvP&apos;s 414(24); 425(24); 450(24);459(24); and 463(24)).I feel obliged to reply to the farther memorandum put forward by the Home Secretary.2,   F/hen the Opium Convention of 1912 was signed there was a reasonable prospect that within a measurable time the smoking of opium could bo practically eradicated.     But the situation in China, after improving for some years, has now reverted to con-ditions in which opium growing and opium smoking are going on to an immense extent.     The Home Secretary points out that in one province of China the practice of opium smoking has been successfully suppressed.     It must be remembered however that the Governor of a Chinese Province has at his disposal methods of suppression which are not at the disposal of British Colonial Governments.3.     I have already stated fully the practical difficulties in the way of carrying out the policy recommended by the Home Secretary and I can only reiterate my conviction that it is impossible to force upon reluctant communities in our Par-Eastern Colonies measures which their Governments after full enquiry hold to be not only impracticable, but even dangerous to our relations with the rulers and peoples.     I repeat that I cannot accept any responsibility for the political consequences if the considered advice of the Governors is rejected.
4.     It is impossible to ignore the difference between the conditions when the Convention was signed and the conditions now obtaining, and therefore to quote the opinion of Governors of Colonies that &quot;far more evil than good would result from trying to prohibit and penalise the practice amongst Chinese&quot; as being inconsistent with tho objects of the Convention leaves out of account the consideration that those objects cannot in present circumstances be attained within a specified time.5.     It seems equally impossible to say that prohibition will mean the cessation of smoking, when the Governors and all the high officials in the Par Eastern Colonies have expressed their conviction, based on intimate personal knowledge, that that will in fact not be the case.6.     The Home Secretary says that the period of 10 years was in his mind as that within which prohibition should bo enforced, but he would see no objection to a longer period if there were good grounds for thinking it necessary.     I submit that there are no grounds for any fixed period.   A period could only be fixed when there has been a radical change in the conditions in China.7.     In stating the position of the British Representatives at the forthcoming Conference, the Home Secretary entirely ignores tho proposal in my previous memorandum that the league of Nations should be invited to send representatives to the Par East to study the conditions, and report to the league what has already been accomplished and what further steps can be taken both in our own possessions and in those of other countries, which may be expected to do more good than harm*flntd.) J.H.T.glonial Office, th^Qgtober. 1924.
