fffilS rjOCUMEBT IS TEE property OF HIS 3RITAimC MAJESTY7S GOvllRJMENT).Sj 0 R E T. CP. 412 (24).cabinet british dyes COMMITTEE.REPORT.1.The Cabinet will recall that in February last theCommittee presented an Interim Report which was adoptedby the Cabinet (CP, 132(24)), The Cabinet then authorised the President of the Board of Trade privately to informthe British negotiators that while His Majesty1^ Govern-ment were prepared to examine any proposed agreement whichmight be submitted to them, they would be unable to approveany agreement which involved a fundamental departure fromthe policy which led to the establishment of the BritishDyes tuffs Corporation and the passing of the Dyestuffs(Import Regulation) Act.2.        Subsequently the Committee hoard the views of tho two Directors who represent the Government on the British Dyestuffs Corporation.   They laid before the Committee a Memorandum on the proposed agreement between the Corporation and the Interessen-Gemeinschaft.   The Committee have also had before them the views of the colour-users and chemical manufacturers.3.        Recently the President of the Board of Trade constituted an informal Committee consisting of the Chairman and the two Government Directors of the Corporation, with influential representatives of the colour-users and of the chemical industry under the Chairmanship of Mr. Reginald McKenna to consider and report upon (a) the organisation of the Corporation, and (b) the proposed agree-ment between the Corporation and the Interessen-Gemeinschaft.This Committee has now reported. &apos;r
All the members of the Committee were agreed;-(a) that there must be a reconstruction of the management of the Corporation;(b) that tho Corporation should by some means or other be entiroly freed from Government control;(o)   that there must be a reduotion of capital. With regard to&apos; the proposed agreement the colour-users on tho Committee maintained their attitude of opposition because, in their judgment, it offends two main principles on which they rely:-(a) that the colour-nBers must be assured of free access to the best quality and range of dyestuffs produced anywhere;   and(b) that they must be on as favourable a baBis as regards price as any of their world competitors and that the price should not be pn such a basis as to retard the sale of their productions to the impoverished nations of the world.This opposition to the proposed agreement is shared in, for various reasons, by the other dye-makers, the chemical industry generally, and British scientific opinion.4,       It appears to the Cabinet Committee to bo impossible to sanction the ratification of the agreement with Germany and that there are only three courses open:-(a)   To retain the Government holding; anddirectors but stand aside from the general management of the Corporation, as successive Governments have tried to do (notvery successfully) hitherto, whilst not    v,i
- z -obstructing such a soheme   of reorganisation of the Corporation as may commend itself to the shareholders and dirootors.(b) To take direction of the Corporation, through appropriately seleoted Government directors, and assume complete responsibility for the prevision of competent teohnioal and oommer-cial management.(c) 4. adopt the oourse reoommended by the Committee and bring the Government interest in the Corporation to a oloae.5,       Against the first oourse it may be urged that there would be no guarantee of effioienoy, criticism would eontlnue and not improbably the Corporation might , decide 9n liquidation.    The second oourse the Committee regard as impraotioab&amp;e.    The  majority of the share4 holders might not permit it unless the Government were, prepared to buy them out, and it is net dosirable that the Government should incur responsibility to a large body of shareholders whea liquidation is an eventuality that oannct lie altogether ruled out.    9n the whole the Committee are inolined to favour the third oourse, whi^h would be greatly faoilitated by the faot that the Corporation is understood to lie prepared to aquire thp-Governments shareB at the present market prioe.    The iamount receivable by the Government would on this oasis be about  630,000.6.       There is some divergence of opinion amo.*gmembers of the Committeo as to the precise terms on which the Government should withdraw its representation on the Board and its financial interest in the Corporation.      It is the opinion of some members thajfc
the withdrawal should be completej it Is th* view of others that the Government should have the power to veto any international agreement which contained objectionable features like those disclosed In the negotiations with the Interessen-Gemeinschaft.   To secure this power of veto would require fresh legislation which it might be difficult to obtain,   The dye-makers, the colour-users and the heavy chemical industries all object to the continuance of Governmental control.   If the cower of veto be retained the responsibility of trying to harmonise these conflicting interests will oontinue as at present to rest upon the Board of Trade. If the veto ia removed and an agreement is concluded with Germany, the colour-users and the other dye-makers are apparently prepared to face the situation which would then arise provided the protection afforded by the Dye-stuffs (Import Regulation) Act Is not withdrawn. 7. If the Government surrenders entirely itsinterest in the Corporation, the Corporation will then -be In the position of an ordinary commercial undertaking. The Dye-stuffs (Import Regulation) Act 1920 remains in force until 1930 and it is not proposed to give any assurance of its continuance beyond that date.   The licences to import provided for under the Act are given on the recommendation of a Committee on which the users are largely represented.   Briefly the practice of the Committee is as follows:-(1)   To grant licences automatically for the importation of any dyestuffs for which adequate&apos; equivalents are not produced in this country. (2)   To grant licences to users to import dye-stuffs for whioh adequate equivalents of British manufacture oannot be obtained at a reasonable price. !
The continuance of the Act, administered in this way, affords dyemakers other than the British Dyestuff Corporation, who have already made substantial progress, reasonable security for their further development, whilst safeguarding the interests of the textile and other trades to whioh. an adequate cupply of dyestuffs at reasonable prices is of vital importance.8.      The share capital held by the Government in the British Dyestuff8 Corporation is 850,000 preference and 850,000 preferred ordinary shares of  1 each.    The present Stock Exchange potations for the preferenoe and preferred ordinary shares of the Corporation are about 10.9d, and 5.0d. respectively. It will he for the Treasury to negotiate the heat possible terms when disposing of the Government&apos;s interest but the Committee desire to recommend to the Cebinet that a substantial part of the stun thus realised whioh will have to be paid   into the Exchequer, should be utilised for the advancement of chemical studies.   One of the main objects whioh previous    * Governments had in view in participating in the British Dyestaffs Corporation and in passing the Dyestuffs Aot was the encouragement of chemical research and the training of chemical experts olSj lines analogous to those pursued with such striking success in Germany.   I&amp;s obligation will remain.   How best it oan be discharged is a matter far further oareful enquiry and consultation between the Board of Trade, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, University authorities and others.
Id sum up,the Committee recommend that the Cabinet should;- .(a) authorise (subject to (b) below) the Treasury and the Board of Trade to bring the Government interest in the British Oyes tuffs Corporation to a close;(b) decide whether a pouer of veto shall be secured upon any future action of the Corporation in concluding international agreements, the precise nature of such veto, *md the method of obtaining it;(o)    request the Treasury to provide a cppital grant for the advancement of chemical research and training and appoint a small Committee to consider and report on the best means of expending such grant.(Initialled on behalf of the Committee(Sgd) T.J0HLS,E.
