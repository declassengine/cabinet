MIS DOOUMMD IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRHL4NMIO MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVERBMMS)S 3 0 U KCPs 488(24),CABINS TMY/ OP PROPERTY aMemorandum by thejLordCbancellor..The law of property. Act * 1922, which received the Royal Assent on the 22nd June in that year, was expressed to come into operation on the 1st JanGary, 1925*It was intended, in accordance with pledges given during the passage of the Bill, that the intervening time should be occupied in preparing Bills consolidating the law relating to settled land, conveyancing, trustees, land transfer, etc, that these Bills, which would incorporate the whole of the law of Property Act, should be passed through Parliament before the 1st January., 1925:. and that the Law of Property Act itself should never come into operation as an independent StatutOo The passage of all this legislation involves the issue of numerous rules of Court and other statutory rules and very large alterations 4&quot;n the existing text books.     For this reason and in order that the profession should be able to familiarise them&quot; selves with the new law in the form in which It has finally passed, it is necessary that the work of consolidation should be completed and the new Bills should pass Into law several months before they actually come into operation.The work of consolidation has taken longer than was anticipated.     All the Bills, however, have now been prepared and have been examined by a Committee of experts presided over by Mr. Justice Romer.     At the same time a Bill amending the Law of Property Act on many technical details has been prepares.
tV- C) uAll this work has made it impossible to pass the Bills before the 1st January, 1925, and accordingly there were introduced into tho late Parliament a Bill postponing the commencement     of tho Act of 1922 until the 1st January, 1925 5   a Bill amending the Act of 1922;:   and six Consolidation Bills,     It is necessary that the first named Bill, which does not raise any controversy, should be passed before Christmas,,It is also desirable that the Amending Bill should he passed &quot;before Christmas, sc that the work of consolidation can be begun as soon as Parliament meets next year and completed by Easter.     If this is done^ the period between Easter and the end of next year will ho available for the purposes of making the necessary rules and of enabling the text book writers to complete their work before the end of the year.     &apos;2he Bill does not raise any controversial issue -all Its provisions being of a highly technical nature-     If it does not pass before Christmas, it would bo necessary early in the lew Year to pass a Bill further postponing the operation cf the Law of Property Act so as to allow the steps described above to be taken.     A further postponement is, on every ground, much to be deprecated^(Intd,)   G.House of lords,13th. November, 1924*2r
