[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet,   September 1924,SECRET.CP. 449 (24).I circulate for the information of my colleagues, a copy of a telegram which I have received from the Viceroy regarding the debate in the Indian Legislative Assembly on the Lee Commission Report. Theiproposals of the Government of India for implementing the Report were passed in the Council of State after some discussion without a division.OLIVIER.. 17th September 1924.From Viceroy, Home Department, 14th September 1924.Three days&apos; debate on Lee Commission Report in Assembly ended yesterday, Moti Lai Nehru&apos;s Amendment to the Government Resolution being carried by 68 to 46. The Amendment in the first place rejected the recommendations of the Lee Commission ; secondly, it substituted the following proposals : All further recruitment in England for the Civil Services under existing rules to be stopped. Powers of appointment and control of the Services, now vested in the Secretary of State, to be transferred to the Government of India and local Govern-ments, such powers to be exercised under laws to be passed by the Indian and Local Legislatures, regulating all matters connected with the Public Services and their conditions of service. Finally, in view of the financial.relief that would result from the stoppage of all recruitment outside India, the amendment expressed willingness to consider the alleged, grievances of present incumbents, and recommended that these should be considered by a Committee of the House which was to go into the entire question on all the materials available to the Roval Commission.2. The Assembly has thus directly negatived the proposals of the Commission as regards control and Indianisation, aud treated the financial recommendations as merely indicating a prima facie case for further enquiry. The tone cf the debate, however, was markedly moderate. The majority were agreed that further European recruitment should be stopped. Ground for this, however, seemed not to be hostility to the European Officer as such, or even in many cases a desire to hasten Indianisation, but the fact that the European Officer was at once the founder and symbol of the existing system of Government, and that to continue to recruit him indicated the intention of continuing the existing system. This seems to have been the idea underlying repeated assertion that the proposals of the Commission amounted to an obstacle to constitutional advance. Constitutional aspect, in fact, was not merely an excuse for declining to consider the proposals, but was the root of opposition. Work done by the Services was freely acknowledged, but the House claimed the right to control them, and it was said more than once that, even if these Services were entirely lndianised, this would give no satisfaction as long as the system remained unaltered. A brown bureaucracy was no better than white.As regards financial relief, comparatively few members tried to attack the proposals on their merits, and the attacks were not very successful. A number of speakers professed to keep an open mind, merely harping on the absence of the evidence placed before.the Commission. European non-official members strongly supported the proposals.Governments case was throughout very fully stated, and the direct attack upon it was neither widespread nor effective.
