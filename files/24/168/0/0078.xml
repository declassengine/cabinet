SECRET.-- 39CP. 476 (24).CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 109.   September 1924.DURING the period covered by this Report unemployment has further increased, but to a smaller extent than during July and August, although it should be pointed out that during the corresponding period of last year an increase of only 6,942 was recorded. As has been explained in Parliament, a substantial part of the recent increase is not a real increase in unemployment, but is due to administrative and legislative changes in the- Unemployment Insurance Scheme, which have brought on the registers unemployed persons who previously, not being entitled to benefit, would not have registered, and would not have been counted as unemployed.It will be seen from the table below that the upward movement of the figures was checked during the first two weeks of September. This was probably due to some extent to the revival of activity in the building trade following the settlement of the recent dispute. The total increase of just over 31,000 during the whole period is distributed mainly over three areas, viz., the North-Eastern Counties (15,000), Wales (10,000) and Scotland (6,000).   In other areas the position has changed little.From Part II of the Report it will be observed that a further decline in employ-ment occurred in the coal-mining industry, in spite of some local improvement in the Midland coal-fields. The iron and steel trade and the shipbuilding and engineering industries still remain considerably depressed. The increase of unemployment amongst women is due principally to seasonal causes.T.

r II.-POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.Coal Mines.-The decline in employment of colliery workers continued during the month, although in certain areas improvement was shown. Slackness of orders from foreign countries caused increased unemployment in Durham and Northumber-land, but increased demand for house coal resulted in better employment in the Yorkshire coal-fields, particularly in the Castleford and Leeds areas. There was also a slight improvement in the Tyneside collieries. In the North-West Counties short time was worked at most collieries, but more settled conditions were found at Workington, where a resumption of work took place. In the Midlands area there was continued improvement, and in many cases a decrease in short-time working. The dispute in the Bristol coal-field still continued, but during the period under review there was an improvement in the Gloucester and Somerset areas, due to demand for house coal. In Scotland, apart from isolated cases of improvement at Leven and Kilmarnock, there was a slight set-back, due to lessened export demands. In Wales restricted demand for coal caused further stoppages of mines and much intermittent working.Stone Quarries. Employment in this industry was on the whole good. China Clay. Work in this industry was fairly brisk.Iron Mines. The position in this industry has not improved, increased employment at some mines being neutralised by discharges from others. Work was suspended at three further mines in the Barrow area, and at Frizington (Cumberland) the only mine remaining open has now closed.Tin Mines. The improvement in the Cornish tin-mining industry continued.IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION.The severe depression in this industry continued during the period under review. No appreciable improvement occurred in the Cleveland area, while at Scunthorpe three of the principal firms, employing 1,150 men, are reported to be closing down. The dispute at Rotherham, which was reported last month, still continued. In the Sheffield area unemployment in the heavy branches increased, but there were signs of improvement in the lighter trades. Rolling mills were more active, though many still remained on short time. Steel sheets were still in demand, and motor steel in request in larger quantities. The crucible steel branch was busier, but only a small proportion of furnaces were in blast. The depression continued in the North-Western area, and at Barrow it is expected that the Haematite steel works will close down. In the Midlands there is little change to report, and unemployment in the industry remains heavy. Except at Chesterfield and Basford, where the position is still good, many suspensions occurred and much short-time working is reported. In Scotland all branches remained dull and orders were very scarce. Further suspensions took place at Motherwell, affecting 1,150 men, and there was intermittent working at Coatbridge. In Wales the position was satisfactory compared with that in the rest of the country, owing largely to the prosperity of the tin-plate trade. There was, however, a tendency to slackness in the steel departments at Cardiff and Ebbw Vale. On the other hand, the production of iron was good. Some depression was experienced at Flint, and employment was only fair at Newport and Pontypool.TIN-PLATE TRADE.The employment position generally remained very good.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.There is no improvement to report in this industry and the depression is still heavy. In the North-Eastern Counties the completion of existing contracts and the absence of fresh orders give a discouraging outlook. At Sunderland 26 out of 53 berths only were occupied. Employment on the Mersey-side was no better and little new construction work was on hand. At Barrow the position remained fairly satisfactory, but a decline in employment may follow the completion of the work on the Orient liner. In the London yards and at Gravesend repair work was very slack, but there was improvement at Tilbury, together with some activity at Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft in connection with the reconditioning of fishing vessels
for the season. Employment was slacker at Woolston and Southampton, but activity continued at Cowes. The trade dispute affecting the Bristol Channel ports continued. In Scotland the general position was on the whole unaltered, but less repair work was being done than formerly. There was increased activity at Greenock and Govan, but otherwise, apart from urgent repairs, there was little work in the Clyde shipyards.ENGINEERING.Motor and Cycle Engineering. The position in this industry remained steady on the whole, although the seasonal decline is still unrelieved. Further suspensions are.reported from Coventry and Sparkhill (Birmingham), but there was a demand for highly skilled workers at Dudley, although large numbers were still on short time. At Derby trade was slack, and there was an increase in unemployment at Wolverhampton. At Redditch the position was better. Suspensions due to seasonal slackness took place &apos;in the Manchester area. In London and the South-Eastern Counties the position was steady, although trade was quiet at Luton, and at Hendon 400 were discharged, owing, it is stated, to over-production. In the South-Western Counties there was increased activity at Oxford and Bristol, and the aircraft industry was also busy.General Engineering. There is little change to report in this industry, and the depression has still continued. In the North-Eastern Counties there were signs of a slight improvement. Marine engineering, however,. was very slack, due to the continued depression in shipbuilding. At Sheffield, makers of small tools were active and saw manufacturers were busy. Railway waggon works continued very slack, but in the machine tool trade there was an optimistic tone due to encouraging enquiries from abroad, although there was no direct improvement in the employ-ment position during the period under review. In the North-Western Counties short time was general in the Textile Engineering Section, but there was some improvement in Locomotive Engineering. In the Electrical Engineering Section employment continued good. In the Midlands Area the slow improvement continued, but unemployment was still heavy. The position was good at Beeston, Basford, Newark, Chesterfield, Leicester and Coalville, but there was little demand for any extra labour. Employment was fair at Long Eaton, Stamford, Kettering, Stoke-on-Trent and Longton. In the South Staffordshire Area the position was still unsettled, although trade was fair at Cradley Heath. Constructional engineering firms at Darlaston were busy. The position at Birmingham declined slightly and further discharges took place at Sparkhill and Smethwick. The machine tool trade at Coventry was brisk. In the South-Eastern Counties steady progress was maintained in this industry. Improvement was shewn at Stratford and Ipswich, and overtime was being worked at Bedford and Chelmsford, but employment was slack at Colchester, Luton, Bermondsey and East Ham. In the South-Western Counties little change occurred. In the building of railway waggons work was brisk at Swindon and fair at Gloucester. In Scotland there was no improvement and trade was quiet, although affording regular employment to a limited number. In Wales the effect of the closed collieries is still being felt in this industry and there is no change to report.TEXTILES.Cotton.-There is no change to report in this industry. Improvement is still forecasted, but no substantial change is expected until the extent of the American crop is definitely known and prices become stabilised. Organised short-time working is to be continued during October, and November in the American section. Employ-ment in the fine spinning section remained good. In the weaving section the improvement was maintained and prospects at Blackburn, Preston and Burnley were much brighter.  The outlook at Todmorden and Skipton has improved.Woollens and Worsteds.-There is little improvement to report in this industry in Yorkshire and employment remained irregular. In spite of the steady increase in wool values, however, the general feeling is one of hopefulness. In the West of kngland a considerable improvement is reported and employment has almost reached the pre-war standard. In Scotland, tweed manufacturers were busy in some centres, out short-time was worked at Galashiels.
Hosiery. Unemployment in this industry still continued, and little prospect of improvement is seen. At Leicester and Basford there was a further decline in employment, and trade was still slack at Ilkeston and Derby. At Nottingham a temporary depression was reported, but it is hoped that this will be overcome by the demand for winter goods. In Scotland there was a temporary lull in trade, but this is customary at this period of the year and prospects remain good.Lace. Employment in this industry continued to be very slack. A considerable amount of &quot;&quot;patterning&quot; has been done in an endeavour to induce trade, but only-small orders are being received. A slight improvement was shown in the curtain trade, but trade was still slack in the plain net and levers&apos;section.Silk. Trade remained very quiet in this industry as the interval between seasons is not yet over. The artificial silk section at Derby, however, still remained busy.Jute. Employment continued good in this industry. There was ample work at Dundee and the spinners have resumed full-time work.Carpets. Employment remained on the whole satisfactory, but there was slackness in certain sections of the industry at Kidderminster.BUILDING AND BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.The position in this industry improved as a result of the settlement of the national dispute, which terminated on the 23rd August, and general activity has been maintained. In most places bricklayers, joiners, plasterers and stonemasons were difficult to obtain, but large numbers of labourers were still unemployed. In the brick and tile industry employment was good generally and conditions have become normal again as a result of the activity in the building trade.CLOTHING.The seasonal depression in this industry still continued and much short time was being worked. Trade was, however, brisk in &quot;West End dressmaking and tailoring, and an improvement was also reported at Stepney. The corset trade generally was slack, although there was a slight improvement at Ipswich.BOOT AND SHOE.There was little change in this industry, although improvement is reported from some centres. Trade was very quiet at Leicester; short time was being worked at Derby; and suspensions were taking place at Stafford. The improvement at Northampton was maintained, but at Wellingborough trade was very slack and much unemployment existed at Kettering. The position at Raunds has been relieved by the placing of Government contracts. Employment was fairly good at Norwich. The general improvement at Kingswood (Bristol) was maintained.POTTERY.Employment in this industry improved slightly. At Stoke-on-Trent factories were fairly well employed in high-class goods, but short time was worked at Hanley. At Burslem trade was better. In the sanitary fire clay branch, trade was good at all centres. At Chesterfield employment in the stone-ware trade was good. The porcelain trade remained satisfactory at Derby and Worcester.DOCK TRANSPORT.Employment generally remained poor. The import of timber at North-Eastern ports continued to provide fair employment, but this is likely to decline with the closing of the Baltic season. At the London Docks trade was generally quiet, but there was a slight improvement on the East Coast due to the import of timber, salt, coal, &amp;c, for the autumn fishing. At Bristol a considerable number of dockers were unemployed, due to a block in the river owing to a wreck, and slackness was reported at Southampton, due to the termination of the soft fruit traffic. There was continued depression in shipping and transport work in Wales.
III.-OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT.(Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion Authorities concerned. In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land have been agreed with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A number of organisations, having as their object the provision of facilities for the settlement of immigrants in certain of the Dominions, have also been assisted. An extension of this assistance to other organisations is under consideration.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of July and August &quot;(with the corresponding figures for July and August of last year) and for the five months ended the 31st August, 1924 and 1923 respectively, are set out in the following Table :-

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.

(Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries.. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924. the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.

These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.
