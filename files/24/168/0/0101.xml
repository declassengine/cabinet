i this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S &apos; GOVERNMENT.CABINET.CANALS (CONTINUANCE OF CHARGING POWERS) BILL.       *3^Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.1.       Before the War the charging powers of transport undertakings were regulated by moans of statutory maximumcharges which were set out in the Act or Order authorising the undertaking or by subsequent amending Acts or orders.The increased costs of labour and materials brought about by the War made these maxima Inadequate, and to meet thedifficulties which then arose, the Minister of Transportifas given temporary powers to modify the permanent statutorymaximum charges after reference to Advisory Committees.These temporary powers were sanctioned as regardsCanals by the following Aots:-Ministry of Transport Act, 1919.Canals (Continuance of Charging Powers) Act, 1922.2.       As things stand at present the temporary provisions ae regards Canals will cease on the 15th February, 1925. Directly thoy ceaoe, the undertakings will automatically return to pre-war statutory maximum charges, unless fresh legislation is enacted.3.       Associations representative of the Canal under-takings approached the Ministry last year with a request that the Government should promote legislation to make the present temporary arrangements permanent.It may ultimately be considered desirable to lntroduoe permanent legislation, but pending further con-slderation of the matter, the Government at the end of last year authorised the Ministry of Transport to announce thatSECRET. CP. 498(24).
r,1 ft f)it was their intention to Include the Canals (Continuance of Charging Powers) Aot, 1S22, in the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act so as to relievo the undertakings in question of the necessity of incurring the expense of promoting Private Bills. I aw now advised, however, that the Canals (Continuance of Charging Powers) Aot, 1622, has been so drafted that its operation beyond the 15th February, 1925, cannot bo secured by including it in the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill and that the only way to overcome this technical difficulty is to introduce during tho current Session a one clause Bill araend-ing the Act in question ao as to make It operative until the 15th February, 1926, thus redeeming the pledge given to tho Canal Association.   Such a Bill has boon so drafted that it would bo possible for further extensions of time, if necessary, to be dealt with in future Expiring Laws Bills and it would, I think, be noncon trover si al in view of the notoriously weak financial position of most canal undortakinga.Pesaible opposition might come froin traders who may apprehend that canal charges would be maintained at an unduly high level, but it is unlikely that they will raise thi3 point, aa it 13 open to them, under tho existing Act, at any time to ask the Minister to refer the existing charges to the Hates Advisory Committee constituted under Section 21 of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, before ?*hom they can state their oase.Tho main safeguard against unduly high charges on the canals is, howevor, the competition ?Mch they sustain from railways, road vehicles and other transport agencies.4*      2h the circumstances I recommend that I should have authority to introduce on the earliest possible day and promote through all its stages without delay a one clause Bill (a draft of which is attached) to extend the operation of the Canals
(Continuance of Charging Powers ) Act, 1922, for one year from 15th February, 1925, so as to redeem the undertaking given by the last two Governments and to enable the Canals to maintain their charges at an adequate level whioh they will otherwise be unable to do after the 15th of February next.(Signed)   WILFRID ASHLEY.Ministry of Transport, 6, Whitehall^Fd&apos;insji S.W,l.19th November, 1924.
