[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.      September 1924.)SECRET.CP. 452 (24).Situation in Bengal.In Continuation of CP. 446 (24), I circulate for the information of my colleagues the following private and personal telegrams which have passed between the Viceroy and myself.OLIVIER.21st September 1924.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy,. 17ih September 1924. 2637.    Private and personal.    Secret.    Please refer to Home  Department telegram of 10th September, 3067 D.    Please telegraph priority fullest possible information as to plans for outbreaks of violence elsewhere than in Bengal stated, in para. 3 (3) of Bengal Government letter quoted therein to be known to exist.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, 17th September 1924. Private and personal. Bengal question. At end of para. 9 of Bengal Govern-ment letter dated 10th July 1.924, and beginning of para. 12, there are statements as to Swaraj party&apos;s financial assistance to revolutionaries. Do these refer to Bengal party or to all-India Swaraj party ? Is cognisance by Nehru and others alleged? If so whom ? Please let me have by cable for information of Cabinet particulars of all important statements of this character which can be regarded as thoroughly substantiated.34Telegram from Viceroy, 19th September 1924.Private and personal. Reference your private and personal telegram dated 17th September. The allegations of financial assistance to revolutionaries hitherto made have reference solely to the Bengal party. We know of nothing to implicate the all-India Swaraj party. Some evidence exists of a Swaraj party fund which appears to be entirely under the control of C. R. Das. There is no evidence to show that Nehru is cognisant of the subvention having been made by Bengal Swaraj party to Bengal revolutionaries.2. Reference your private and personal telegram 2637. It is not clear to what the Bengal Government referred and as you required an early reply, I have not consulted Lytton Secret reports from secret sources which cannot be used, show that (1) ITaziat Mohani, the agitator and professed apostle of violence, recently released from jail on completion of sentence, has undertaken to organise a violence party in the United Provinces; (2) Madras addresses were found on search of Sasoda 1&apos;al&apos;s house in Bengal when bombs were found : (3) Bengal revolutionaries, meeting at Coconada during Congress of 1923, conferred with the representatives from the Punjab, Delhi, Gujarat and Ahmedabad with a view to starting revolutionaries&apos; parties to these centres.3. On the present state of our information we are not disposed to regard these incidents as pointing to substantial probability of violent outbreaks elsewhere than in Bengal.7671     50  9.24
