In tho event of very serious pressure it was proposed, in the case of amendments 1 and 2,to maintain the compulsory provisions of the Bill on the demand of a bare majority of tho men entitled to vote,
excluding, however, any limit of maintenance costs and excluding also interest charges upon the costs of maintenance.    With regard to the third amendment it might be necessary to insert a clause providing that six years after the passing of the Act a Resolution of both Houses of Parliament could authorise the Secretary for Mines to make regulations for enforcing     the use of the baths by the workmen before leaving the colliery.    The period of six years in question would., it was represented, enable valuable experience to be gained relative to the extent to which the facilities were being used. iWith regard to Clause 1 (4) of the Bill, the Committee were reminded that it was? not proposed to confer power on the Board cf Trade to exempt from the operation of the Act op the ground of cost.After individual Members of the Committee had expressed general approval of the provisions of theBill, the Committee agreed:-(l)   To approve the Coal Mines (Washingand Drying Accommodation) Bill in the form of the draft annexed to CP.391 ( 4), subject to the inclusion   of the words &quot;one year&quot; after the words &quot;expiration of&quot; in Clause 1 (l), and to any minor or other drafting alterations that may be necessary or desirablei( )   To authorise the Secretary for Mines to arrange for the immediate.introduction of the Bill in tho form approved by the Committee,(3)   That the Secretary for Mines should have discretion to decide as to the course of action to be taken respecting the amendments td the Bill.
