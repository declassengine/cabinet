THIS DOCtMOTT IS THE PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S G0VER1M3UT.SECRET.CP. 402 (24)i(JABIOlLocal Authorities Loans (Scotland) Acts, 1891 and 1893.memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.1. The issue of steak Toy ideal authorities in Scotland is regulated by the Local Authorities loans (Scotland) Acts, 1891 and 1893. v. Under ^hese Acts a minimum price of issue of ninety-fire per cent, is fixed and it is also provided that, where   a local authority has issued stock, any further issues by the authority must bear the same rate of interest as the ariginal issue.   The Acts give to the Secrotary for Scotland certain powers of making amending regulations, but I am adfised by this Lord Advocate that theae powers do not enable me fro alter the minimum price of issue or to fix a rate of interest on a new issue different from that carried by earlier issues by the same authority.2.    In these oiroumstaneee it 1b.obvious that the statutory provisions have become useless for /the purposes of new issues in the case of local authorities who issued stock before the war. Aa an example, I may cite the case of Fife County Council,   That authority issued stock before the war at four per centt and now requires to mako a further,issue.     It is clearly impossible for thorn to comply with a four peroent. irate of interest and a minimum price of issue of ninety-five per cent.   A state of deadlock&apos;has therefore arisen.3.    In tho case of the corresponding Statutes in England, the Minister of Health has a power of a very wide nature to make regulations varying the statutory requirements, so as to avoid a situation such as has arisen in Scotland, and I find it necessary to ask for legislation which will give me a similar power *t4*    I attach a draft Bill for this purpose and I desire authority to introduce it at the earliest possible moment-, Irdm information which has reached me, there seems to be,a reasonable prospaot that all parties will oonour in the passage of the Bill without discussion at any stage, and it is on this footing that I make the &quot;request for authority to introduce the Bill; - i&apos; t - ADAH30N&apos;.Scottish bffioa,, Whitehall, 3.W.1,17th July, 1924.
