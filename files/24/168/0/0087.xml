CONFIDENTIAL.fllfc OF THE ZLNOVIEV INCIDENT.(2mm. ZindvieV letter was brought to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State on the &quot;LOtli October in the form of a copy of the original document. &apos; The situation was very carefully considered, but although the most, convincing assurances of. the genuine character of the letter had been received it was not thought right to put the paper before the Prime Minister until corroborative proofs were forthcoming of its having reached this country. Such proof was obtained on Saturday, the lltii October, and was communicated to the Under-Secretary of State on the 13th October, whereupon it was decided to submit the whole matter to Mr. MacDonald.The Zinoviev letter was formally registered on the .14th October. Minutes were written in the Northern Department patting forward the case for and against protest and publicity and stating explicitly that the Foreign Office had been assured of the undoubted authenticity of the letter.. The papers came before the TJnder-Secretary on the loth October. He added to the foregoing reference to the question of authenticity the following statement:- . .&quot;Yes.   We have now heard definitely on. absolutely reliable authority that :     the Russian letter was received and discussed at a recent meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain.&quot;The Under-Secretary proceeded to minute the paper as follows :-&quot; It is quite true -and we have always felt that we get nothing out of the . Soviet Government by any remonstrances simply because these quite shameless liars merely, deny everything however clearly established. On the other hand, there is much force in the view that our best and only defence against these treacherous proceedings is publicity. It does not seem fair to.our own people that our knowledge&quot; of these Russian machinations should remain for ever concealed. We have not only every right but almost a duty to bring such cases of propaganda as the present one to the notice of the Soviet Government under paragraph .13 of the memorandum handed to M. Krassin on the 29th May, 1923.*&quot;It was agreed in virtue of the formula respecting propaganda, enclosed in the memorandum of the 29th May, 1923, that the Soviet Government should noj support with funds, or in any other form, persons or bodies or agencies or institutions whose aim is to spread discontent or to foment rebellion in any part of the British Empire. We cannot really rest content with the ridiculous assertion of the Soviet Government that they give no support whatever to the Third International.&quot; I think therefore that we should do two things : (1) address to M. Rakovsky a formal note of protest with a request for the definite stoppage of this propaganda of the most violent and indefensible kind and (2) give full information to our press.(Initialled)        &quot; E. A. C.&quot;October 15, 1924.&quot;The Prime Minister, in turn, added the following minute, dated the 16th October: &quot; We must be sure that- the document is authentic.&quot; I favour the publication of such things, and the way to do it is to address a despatch to M. Rakovsky. Prepare such and see how it looks. It must be so well-founded and important that it carries conviction and guilt. If not, it will do harm.(Initialled)        &quot;J. R. M.&quot; October 16, 1924.&quot;* The relevant passage in this memorandum is,&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government will be quite willing-, in the event of any future infringement of the pledge again recorded, that the case shall be brought immediately to the attention of the Government concerned, rather than such instances, if they are found to occur, shall be allowed to accumulate before complaint is made.&quot;2485 [12249]Printed for the Cabinet.

The papers were received back in the Foreign Office from the Prime Minister on the evening of Friday, the 17th October, and the Department set to work at once to prepare a draft ou the lines indicated by him. The Departments draft, after much elaboration and revision, was submitted to the Permanent Under-Secretary on Monday the 20th October, but the latter himself made further extensive alterations in it, and it was not ready for transmission to the Prime Minister uutil Tuesday, the 21st October   It was sent to him on that day with the following minute attached to it: &quot; I now submit a draft to M. Rakovsky, which I think puts the case squarely. It can be published so soon as it has reached M. Rakovsky&apos;s hands..(Initialled) &quot; E. A. C.&quot; October 21, 1924.&quot;The Prime Minister was at the time travelling about making speeches in different towns. The papers did not, v!t appears, come before him until Thursday, the 23rd October. Thpy were ret\Lfiied to the Foreign Office on the morning of Friday, the 24th, and it will be seen that the original draft, which is annexed to this memorandum, had been entirely revised and largely rewritten by the Prime Minister in his own hand. It was passed on to the Department for action, and was copied and signed in accordance with the usual practice when the Secretary of State is away-by Mr. Gregory, the Assistant Secretary in charge of the Northern Department, sent off to M. Rakovsky, and communicated to the press the same evening.A good deal of interest, has been aroused by the fact that the &quot; Daily Mail &quot; is known to have had a copy of the Zinoviev letter in its possession which it was about to publish. This fact, which was brought to. the.notice of the Foreign Office on the Friday afternoon, was one of the reasons which made it seem desirable to the Depart-ment that publication, which was considered to have been approved by the Prime Minister in any event, should take place on Saturday rather than on the following Sunday or Monday,Mr. Ramsay MacDonald has stated that he was genuinely dumbfounded when he heard late on Friday night that copies of Zinoviev&apos;s letter and of our protest had been communicated to the newspapers and would appear in Saturday&apos;s issue, and a series of telegrams were exchauged between him and the Permanent Under-Secretary on the subject.It is clear that a complete misunderstanding had arisen. The Prime Minister had expected that his draft would he returned to him for renewed consideration when it had been copied out, but owing to the pressure of work to which he was for the moment subjected, he had omitted to make any note whatever on the paper that this was his expectation.It is true that the draft which he had practically rewritten did not actually bear tho Prime Ministers initials at the foot. This is, however, a not infrequent omission, the Secretary of State&apos;s manuscript corrections on drafts submitted to him being ordinarily regarded as indicating his definite approval of the document so revised. A number of recent cases of the kind have since been brought to Mr. MacDonald&apos;s notice. It was accordingly only following the routine of departmental work that action should have been taken so soon as the revised draft note to M. Rakovsky was returned by the Prime Minister. There was the less reason to suppose that the Department were not carrying out his wishes precisely, inasmuch as every aspect of the action to be taken had been exhaustively discussed in minutes. The Prime Minister had explicitly approved publication and had intimated that the appropriate procedure was a note to be addressed to M. Rakovsky. This he had made dependent on two conditions: (1) That the document was authentic; (2) that he should see the draft. Both conditions had, in the view of the Department, been, fulfilled.In view of the evident misunderstanding, it was considered desirable that the head of the Northern Department should go to Aberavon and amplify the information and explanations which had meanwhile been sent to the Prime Minister&apos;by telegram ?nd by letter, and although there were no possible steps by which the situation could be rendered less embarrassing than it in fact proved itself to be to the Prime Minister, Mr. MacDonald&apos;s final telegram to Sir Eyre Crowe stated that &quot; he wished to make it quite clear to him that he had never doubted that Sir Eyre Crowe had clone his very best and that in his (Mr. MacDonald&apos;s) heart he had no reserve when he assured Sir Eyre Crowe of his confidence.&quot;In reply to the note signed by Mr. Gregory on behalf of the Secretary of State, .M. Rakovsky sent the reply which he published in the papers of Sunday, the
8 526th October, and of which a copy is annexed to this memorandum. This note is dated the 25th October and the question of what reply, if any, should be sent to it is the subject of a separate memorandum. On the 27th October M. Rakovsky sent a further note written this time not on his own initiative, but on instructions from the Soviet Government, and a copy of this note is also annexed. These two communications were respectively dealt with as follows. M. Rakovsky&apos;s note of the 25th October was sent to the Prime Minister on the same day and was returned by him at once with the following minute : &quot; When I return to town information will be to hand to carry the matter another stage.(Initialled)        &quot;J. R. M.&quot;October 25.&quot;Rakovsky&apos;s second note (written under instructions from his Government) was taken to Aberavon on Monday, the 27th October, by Mr. Gregory, who was then instructed by the Prime Minister to see M. Rakovsky personally, return the note to him, and tell him that we could not agree to accept it. This was done on Tuesday, the 28th October, and on the following day M. Rakovsky sent the note back and insisted that we. must accept it. It was again returned to M, Rakovsky by the Prime Ministers instructions on the 31st October, and M. Rakovsky sent it back to the Foreign Office for the third time on Saturday, the 1st November. On the evening of Sunday, the 2nd November, Mr. MacDonald saw M. Rakovsky in reference to both notes and recorded his interview in the following minute : &quot;I saw M. Rakovsky last night at 9&quot;30. I pointed out that his note implied not only that the Zinoviev letter was a forgery, which he was entitled to do, but that the forgery may have been committed by one of our officials. That I would not listen to nor do anything in any way to seem to admit. I pointed out that there was no analogy between his accusation by implication and our definite complaint against the Russian officials with proofs, and gave him quite clearly to understand that his note will not be placed on our files or be recognised in any way unless that part of it were eliminated. In the end he had nothing to say, and I understood he gave in. Write and say you understand that he saw me and discussed matter ; although I have not seen his note of the 1st (returning for the third time the note of the 27th), you are informed it was discussed between us, and I pointed out why it could not be accepted. Ask if he has anything further to say. If he replies that he has nothing, then you may take the action you suggest (viz., say that we regard the note as non avenu), but not without further reference to me or my successors.(Initialled)      &quot;J. R. M.&quot;These instructions were carried out on the 4th November by the despatch of the following letter, the draft of which had been corrected by the Prime Minister himself : &quot;Dear M. Rakovsky, &quot;Foreign Office, November 4, 1924.&quot; I understand that you saw the Prime Minister on Sunday evening and discussed with him the question of your official note of the 27th October, though he had not at the time seen your note of the 1st November.&quot;Mr. MacDonald explained to you at length the reasons why it could not be accepted, and was under the impression that you acquiesced in the position.&quot; As your note of the 1st instant was written before the conversation referred to, he assumes that you propose to address him further before he replies.(Signed)      &quot;J. D. Gregory.&quot;Meanwhile a committee of the Cabinet had been investigating the authenticity of the Zinoviev letter, and on the night of the 4 th November the Cabinet issued a communique in the following terms :-&quot; The committee appointed on the 31st October to examine the authenticity of the Zinoviev letter, after hearing the Departments concerned, find it impossible on the evidence before them to come to a positive conclusion on the subject, The original letter has not been produced to or seen by any Government Department, and action was taken on what was not claimed to be more than a copy. Unfortunately, in the short time available, the committee found it.impossible to obtain evidence throwing further light on the matter.&quot;
Subsequently, the Prime Minister sent for the papers and wrote the following final minute dealing with M. Rakovsky&apos;s second note and the correspondence with Mr. Gregory arising out of it: &quot;I have asked if any reply has now come, and have been told there is none, so I must minute my views further. The proposal to burn the note of the 27 th October * will not do. The despatch sent to M. Eakovsky on the 24th October was prepared on the assumption of the authenticity of the Zinoviev letter, and the Cabinet did not accept that view. The despatch should be withdrawn (provided no agreement is reached with M. Rakovsky), and that . carries with it the Rakovsky reply. Great care should be exercised as to formal withdrawal. The Cabinet decision can be cited. The Foreign Office assumption of genuineness reminded; then launch into real substance of our complaint, viz. (a), we are not satisfied with their propaganda; (b) we cannot allow that there is no connection between acts of Third International and responsibility of Soviet Government.   If this is reiterated, we get what we want.(Initialled)        &quot; J. R. M.&quot;November 6, 1924.&quot;Mr. MacDonald went out of office before action on this minute could be taken. On the 10th November the following letter, dated the&apos;8th November, was received in the Foreign Office: &quot; Dear Mr. Gregory,&quot; Your letter of the 4th November reached me with some delay owing to my absence from London. It follows from your letter that Mr. MacDonald had drawn incorrect conclusions from the conversation I had with him on Sunday evening, the 2nd November. I must therefore reiterate that on the question of our note of the 27th October I continue to maintain the position outlined in my letter of the&apos; 29th October.&quot;The question of how this and the previous letter from M. Rakovsky should be dealt with forms the subject of a separate memorandum.Foreign Office, November 11, 1924.* This refers to a departmental suggestion submitted to the Prime Minister, with ihe original&apos; draft, of which a revised &quot;version became Mr. Gregory&apos;s above letter to M. Rakovsky of the 4th November.
CONFIDENTIAL.MEMORANDUM ON THE ZINOVIEV LETTER.TWO documents were received from M. Rakovsky in reply to the protest signed on behalf of the ex-Prime Minister by Mr. Gregory and issued to the press on Friday, 24th October, last. Copies of these documents are annexed to the present memorandum.The first of these was sent to the Foreign Office by M. Rakovsky on his own initiative on the 25th October and was published in London on the same day. No reply has so far been returned to it. The second note was addressed to us- by M. Rakovsky by instructions of the Soviet Government on the 27th October, and although it was not communicated by the Foreign Office to the press, the text had been published in Moscow by the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and appeared in the &apos;&apos; Daily Herald&apos;&apos; before it was delivered to us. This second note was returned to M. Rakovsky in accordance with Mr. MacDonald&apos;s instructions, with an intimation that it was not a note that His Majesty&apos;s Government could possibly consent to receive. M. Rakovsky sent it back again to the Foreign Office, and again he was told that we could not accept it. A third time it was sent back, and on this occasion M. Rakovsky was told that the- Prime Minister as the result of an interview which he had had with the Soviet Charge d Affaires on the 2nd November  understood that the latter acquiesced in the view that the note could in no circumstances be accepted. In a further letter, dated the 8th November and delivered at the Foreign Office on the 10th November, M. Rakovsky now informs Mr. Gregory that Mr. MacDonald has mistaken his (M. Rakovsky&apos;s) attitude. Copies of this letter and of Mr. Gregory&apos;s letter of the 2nd November are annexed to the present memorandum.The question for immediate consideration is whether a reply or replies should be returned either to M. Rakovsky&apos;s letter to Mr. Gregory of the 8th November or to his note to Mr. MacDonald of the 25th October, or to both, and, if so, what the nature of the reply or replies should be. The following general observations may perhaps be of assistance in considering these questions : In the first place, it must be assumed that the governing body in Russia (that is to say, the Politbureau or Central Committee of the Russian Communist party, which controls the actions, both of the Third International and of the Soviet Government) will make no immediate and radical alteration in their present policy of invariable and sometimes open hostility towards His Majesty&apos;s Government in consequence of protests made against it by the latter. Nevertheless, the decisions taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the notes from M. Rakovsky now under consideration, and in regard to such further evidence of the hostile intentions of the Russian Communist party as may in any event be expected to come to light, will not be wholly without effect on the fortunes and actions of the Soviet Govern-ment; and it therefore seems desirable that the general policy to be followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government should be now determined and the nature of the replies to M. Rakovsky if any replies are considered desirable should be adapted to this policy.Three possible courses appear to be open to His Majesty&apos;s Government: 1. To protest, and to press their protest to its logical conclusion, which must inevitably lead to a fresh rupture of diplomatic relations, or, 2. To protest, but not to press the point home,3. To disengage themselves from the controversy bequeathed to them by the late administration, and ignore the Soviet Government as much and as long as this position is tenable.2486   [12252]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1924.
The objections to the first of these three courses are : (a.) That it will deprive this country of the relatively small commercial benefits which it derives from the Trade Agreement; (b.) That it will give rise to an acute and prolonged public controversy; (c.) That a rupture would give the Soviet Government a great deal of advertise-ment and fresh material for propaganda; (d.) That the Soviet Government would be able to set off against a presentrupture with us the rapprochement which they have succeeded in makingtowards M. Herriot&apos;s Government; (e.) That although a rupture would bring British policy into line with that ofthe United States, it is unlikely that it would be received with expressedapprobation in European countries; (/.) That if our mission is withdrawn from Moscow we should receive lessinformation about Russian affairs than we do now; (g.) That whilst it is notoriously easy to sever diplomatic relations, equallynotorious is the difficulty in finding the suitable means of resuming diplo-matic relations when desired; (A.) That a rupture of relations is a weapon which can only be used once; thatit is therefore desirable that it should be reserved for an occasion whenit is likely to produce the maximum effect upon the Soviet Government,and that their present position is not at all precarious and their stabilitynot likely to be upset by relations with this country being again broken off.The objection to protesting without pressing the protests home is that this course might be considered somewhat undignified and might undermine the weight which considered and public statements by His Mlajesty&apos;s Government should properly carry in foreign countries.It is of course open to question whether the Soviet Government would in fact permit the controversy arising out of the Zinoviev letter to peter out, but there is a possibility that they might do so, if His Majesty&apos;s Government were either to refrain from returning any replies to the notes from M. Rakovsky now under consideration, or were to return replies couched in mild terms; and the objections mentioned above to further recriminations afford reasons why we should give them every opportunity of so doing. The experience of the Foreign Office is that the Communist party in Russia are strengthened in proportion as they can advertise themselves and their ambitions in other countries, but that we, on the other hand, have much to gain by thrusting them into a wholesome obscurity. It is suggested that if His Majesty&apos;s Government favour an attempt to do this and to disengage themselves from the controversy which has taken place between Mr. MacDonald and M. Rakovsky, the best course to pursue would be for them to refrain from any written replies to the two notes now under consideration but to define their attitude in a statement made to the House of Commons at. the beginning of the next session by the Secretary of State or the Prime Minister, somewhat in the following lines : The spokesman of the Government could excuse himself on grounds of good taste from detailed comments on the actions of his predecessor in office which were not strictly relevant to the foreign policy of the new Government, and would proceed straight to the questions of substance : Whether Zinoviev&apos;s letter was genuine and what His Majesty&apos;s Government were going to do about it.The question of authenticity was not one which could be passed over. The action of the last.Government in, firstly, making and publishing a grave charge against a foreign Government, and, secondly, in stating that they were unable to decide whether this charge was well-grounded, was open to obvious criticism. He felt bound to declare that His Majesty&apos;s present Government, after examining both the evidence available to the late Cabinet and further corroborative evidence received since the late Government issued their communique of the 6th November, were unable to admit that there could be any doubt as to the authenticity of the document. We knew that it was genuine, and that, moreover, whatever M. Chicherin might think or say, M. Zinoviev knew that we knew it was genuine.The Secretary of State (or Prime Minister) might then pass to the considera-tions of future policy and emphasise that, so far as propaganda and hostile activities were concerned, the policy of the new Government could be at once and easily defined as one of absolute continuity with the declarations made by their pre-predecessors for instance, Mr. MacDonald&apos;s statement in the speech which inaugurated
the work of the Anglo-Russian Conference. On that occasion Mr. MacDonald said? that &quot; he did not question the right, of the Soviet Government to set up any form of: internal Government which might seem good to it, but that he did maintain that the first essential of friendly and profitable relations between the Union and this country was that the former should reciprocate the British attitude in this matter, and should desist from countenancing directly or indirectly anything that &quot;smacked of&apos; an attempt to carry on among the people of this country, either at home or abroad, a propaganda which, when internally inspired, might be legitimate, but, when con-trolled, and even financed, from abroad, was not legitimate. It was his duty to make it plain that the people of this country would require more on this head than formal undertakings, and he had himself top intimate a knowledge of international movements to be deceived by false distinctions.&quot;One of two things might happen : either the governing body in Russia would adhere to its declared intention to promote revolution in foreign countries, or it would not. If it did, the fact would soon become plain and would be resolutely faced, but he trusted that the Communist party in Russia would take to heart what he might call the reply returned by the British electors to the Zinoviev letter, and would relieve him of the necessity of pursuing a correspondence which could only exacerbate relations between the two countries.Supposing that some such statement were made in the House of Commons, there is a possibility that the leaders of the Communist party in Russia would be content to reply to it in speeches addressed to their adherents in Moscow, without the exchange of further diplomatic correspondence.In case His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide that one or both of M. Rakovsky&apos;s notes cannot be left unanswered, two draft notes are annexed to the present memorandum which may be of assistance to them in deciding what form of reply or replies should be despatched.Foreign Office, November 11, 1924.* Mr. MacDonald&apos;s speech was published in txtenso but has not been laid before Parliament.Draft Letters to M. Rakovsky. (I.)Foreign Office, Dear M. Rakovsky, November    , 1924.I HAVE submitted to the Secretary of State your letter to me, marked C.R.-8553, of the 8th November.Mr. Chamberlain instructs me to reply that he has caused the records left in this Office by his predecessor to be searched, and that your note of the 27th October on the subject of M. Zinoviev&apos;s despatch to the Central Committee of Great Britain has not been found among them. Mr. Chamberlain is, of course, familiar with the substance of this note, which was published in Moscow, but he has no intention of departing from the decision communicated to you by Mr. MacDonald and recorded in this. Office, that the note in question was one which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot consent to receive.
, Sir, Foreign Office, November    , 1924.I HAVE bad under consideration your reply of the 25th October to the note which my predecessor addressed to you with regard to the activities of the Communist International in this country.2. In the third paragraph of that reply you took it upon yourself to assert within the briefest period after the receipt of Mr. MacDonald&apos;s note and apparently upon grounds of internal evidence alone the spurious nature of the letter from M. Zinoviev which was the occasion of his representations. The reasons which you adduced in support of this extraordinary assertion are quite unconvincing. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot claim so intimate a knowledge of the processes of the Communist International as you would appear to possess, and they must refuse to discuss mere points of detail so remote from the real issue. They will only remark that if it is desired to find the Communist International described as the Third Communist International, and M. Zinoviev as President of the Presidium, it is only necessary to turn to the official publications and daily press of the Union in order to do so, and that the contents of M. Zinoviev&apos;s letter, far from being a tissue of absurdities, are merely the common-places of Com-munist propaganda the world over.3. But the arguments which you have put forward do not deserve even this measure of consideration. The circumstances in which M. Zinoviev&apos;s letter has fallen into the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government admit of no doubt of its genuine character, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to discuss the matter. No mere denial on the part of M. Zinoviev is of any value whatever in view of the evidence which His Majesty&apos;s Government have in their possession ; nor is it clear to them how it is that the Soviet Government can presume to speak with authority on a matter like the present so long as it disclaims all connection with M. Zinoviev&apos;s organisation.4. I must further observe that you would entirely misapprehend the character of the representations made to you by my predecessor if you supposed that they dealt with M. Zinoviev&apos;s letter only. The activities of which His Majesty&apos;s Government complain are not confined to one particular letter, but, on the contrary, extend to a whole body of revolutionary propaganda of which the letter is a fair specimen, and which is sometimes con-ducted in secret and sometimes, as you rightly remark, not concealed. The pronouncements of M. Zinoviev, which have been broadcast throughout the world, are in themselves sufficient evidence of a propaganda in which the Third International, with the knowledge and consent of the Soviet Government, perpetually indulges; and it is this system which in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is inconsistent not only with the solemn undertakings given by your Government, but with the existence of normal diplomatic relations.5. I entirely associate myself in this regard with the remarks of Mr. MacDonald, to which I have nothing to add.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[N 8105/108/38] No. 1.Mr. MacDonald to M. Bakovskg.Sir, Foreign Office, October 24, 1924.I HAVE the honour to invite your attention to the enclosed copy of a letter whioh has been received by the Central Committee of the British Communist party from the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, over the signature of M. Zinoviev, its president,, dated the 15th September. The letter contains instructions to British subjects to work for the violent overthrow oE existing institu-tions in this country, and for the subversion of His Majesty&apos;s armed forces as a means to that end.2. It is my duty to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot allow this propaganda and must regard it as a direct interference from outside in British domestic affairs.3. No one who understands the constitution and the relationships of the Communist International will doubt its intimate connection and contact with the Soviet Government. No Government will ever tolerate an arrangement with a foreign Government by which the latter is in formal diplomatic relations of a correct kind with it, whilst at the same time a propagandist body organically connected with that foreign Government encourages and even orders subjects of the former to plot and plan revolutions for its overthrow. Such conduct is not only a grave departure from the rules of international comity, but a violation of specific and solemn undertakings repeatedly given to His Majesty&apos;s Government.     .4. So recently as the 4th June of last year the Soviet Government made the following solemn agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government: &quot;The Soviet Government undertakes not to support with funds or in any other form persons or bodies or agencies or institutions whose aim is to spreaddiscontent or to foment rebellion in any part of the British Empire.....and to impress upon its officers and officials the full and continuous observance of these. conditions.&quot;5. Moreover, in the treaty which His Majesty&apos;s Government recently concluded with your Government, still further provision was made for the faithful execution of an analogous undertaking, which is essential to the existence of good and friendly relations between the two countries. His Majesty&apos;s Government mean that these iindertakings shall be carried out both in the letter and in the spirit, and it cannot accept the contention that whilst the Soviet Government undertakes obligations, a political body, as powerful as itself, is to be allowed to conduct a propaganda and support it with money, which is in direct violation of the official agreement. The; Soviet, Government either has or has not the power to make such agreements. If it has the power, it is its duty to carry them out and see that the other parties are not deceived. If it has not this power, and if responsibilities which belong to the Stale in other countries are in Russia in the keeping of private and irresponsible bodies, the Soviet Government ought not to make agreements whioh it knows it cannot cany out.(i I should be obliged if you would be good enough to let me have the observa-tions. of your Government on this subject without delay.I have, tec.J. RAMSAY MacDONALD,[763 aa-1]RUSSIA. October 24, 1924.
Enclosure in No. 1.Executive Committee, Third Communist International, Presidium.To the Central Committee, British Communist Party. (Very Secret.)Dear Comrades, Moscow, September 15, 1924.THE time is approaching for the Parliament of England to consider the treaty concluded between the Governments of Great Britain and the S.S.S.R. for the purpose of ratification. The fierce campaign raised by the British bourgeoisie around the question shows that the majority of the same, together with reactionary circles, are against the treaty for the purpose of breaking off an agreement consofidating the ties between the proletariats of the two countries leading to the restoration of normal relations between England and the S.S.S.R.The proletariat of Great Britain, which pronounced its weighty word when danger threatened of a break-off of the past negotiations and compelled the Government of MacDonald to conclude the treaty, must show the greatest possible energy in the further struggle for ratification and against the endeavours of British capitalists to compel Parliament to annul it.It is indispensable to stir up the masses of the British proletariat, to bring into movement the army of unemployed proletarians, whose position can be improved only after a loan has been granted to the S.S.S.R. for the restoration of her economics and when business collaboration between the British and Russian proletariats has been put in order. It is imperative that the group in the Labour party sympathising with the treaty should&apos;bring increased pressure to bear upon the Government and parliamentary circles in favour of the ratification of the treaty.Keep close observation over the leaders of the Labour party, because these may easily be found in the leading-strings of the bourgeoisie. The foreign policy of the Labour party as it is already represents an inferior copy of the policy of the Curzon Government.   Organise a campaign of disclosures of the foreign policy of MacDonald.The I.K.K.I. will willingly place at your disposal the wide material in its posses-sion regarding the activities of British imperialism in the Middle and Far East. In the meanwhile, however, strain every nerve in the struggle for the ratification of the treaty, in favour of a continuation of negotiations regarding the regulation of relations between the S.S.S.R. and England. A settlement of relations between the two countries will assist in the revolutionising of the international and British proletariat not less than a successful rising in any of the working districts in England, as the establishment of close contact between the British and Russian proletariat, the exchange of delegations and workers, &amp;c, will make it possible for us to extend and develop the propaganda of ideas of Leninism in England and the. colonies. Armed warfare must be preceded by a struggle against the inclinations to compromise which are embedded among the majority of British workmen, against the ideas of evolution and peaceful extermination of capitalism. Only then will it be possible to count upon complete success of an armed insurrection.. In Ireland and the colonies the case is different; there there is a national question, and this represents too great a factor for success for us to waste time on a prolonged preparation of the working class.But even in England, as in other countries where the workers are politically developed, events themselves may more rapidly revolutionise the working masses than propaganda..   For instance, a strike movement, repressions by the Government, &amp;c.Prom your last report it is evident that agitation-propaganda work iu the army is weak, in the navy a very little better. Your explanation that the quality of the members attracted justifies the quantity is right in principle, nevertheless it would be desirable to have cells in all the units of the troops, particularly among those quartered in the large centres of the country, and also among factories working on munitions and at military store depots. We request that the most particular attention be paid to these latter.In the event of danger of war, with the aid of the latter and in contact with the transport workers, it is possible to paralyse all the military preparations of the bourgeoisie and to make a start in turning an imperialist \\ ar into a class war. Now more than ever we should be on our guard. Attempts at intervention in China show that world imperialism is still full of vigour and is once more making endeavours to restore its shaken position and cause a new war, which, as its final objective, is to bring about the break-up of the Russian proletariat and the suppression of the budding
world revolution, and, further, would lead to the enslavement of the colonial peoples. &quot; Danger of War &quot;; &quot; The Bourgeoisie seeks War, Capital fresh Markets &quot; these are the slogans which you. must familiarise the masses with, with which you. must go to work into the mass of the proletariat. These slogans will open to you the doors of comprehension of the masses, will help you to capture them and march under the banner of Communism.The military section of the British Communist party, so far as we are aware, further suffers from a lack of specialists, the future directors of the British Red army.It is time you thought of forming such a group, which, together with the leaders, might be, in the event of an outbreak of active strife, the brain of the military organisation of the partyGo attentively through the lists of the military &quot;cells,&quot; detailing from them the move energetic and capable men; turn attention to the more talented military specialists who have, for one reason or another, left trie service and hold Socialist views. Attract them into the ranks of the Communist party if they desire honestly to serve the proletariat and desire in the future to direct not the blind mechanical forces in the service of the bourgeoisie, but a national army.Form a directing operative head of the military section.Do not put this off to a future moment, which may be pregnant with events and catch you unprepared.Desiring you all success, both in organisation and in your struggle, With Comm unist greetings,President of the Presidium of the J.K.K.I., ZINOVIEV.Member of the Presidium, McMANUS.Ktjusinen, Secretary.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]      $30RUSSIA. [October 25, 1924.]CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[N 8121/108/38] No. 1.M. Rakovsky to Mr. MacDonald. (Received October 25.)Sir, London, October 25, 1924.I HAVE received the Foreign Office note of the 24th October, signed by-Mr. J. D. Gregory, to which I have the honour to make the following reply : 1. As recently as last year, after the settlement of the diplomatic conflict which took place in May, it was agreed between the representative of the Government of the Soviet Union in London and the Foreign Office that, in the interests of the strengthening of friendly relations between the two countries, both parties would endeavour to settle by direct conversations any incidents which might arise, resorting to the despatch of notes only in the case of this friendly procedure failing to bring about a favourable result. After my arrival in London the Foreign Office personally confirmed that in the future we would adhere to this reasonable practice, which would remove avoidable misunderstandings and prevent future conflicts. By maintaining this rule we were able to liquidate in a friendly way a number of incidents affecting both countries. As an instance, I will mention the fact that my Government did not resort to a public protest and to creating conflict in connection with the extremely important incident bearing upon the most vital interests of the Union which arose as a result of the declaration made by the representative of the British Government, Professor Gilbert Murray, at the Conference of the League of Nations a declaration which was in contradiction with our agreements of last year and with the provision of the new treaties of the 8th August concerning non-interference in our internal affairs, and which flagrantly violated the note of the British Government on the recognition of the Soviet Union.2. To my great regret, the note which I received last night, in which absolutely unfounded accusations are made by the Foreign&apos; Office against the Soviet Government, at a moment when British opinion is concentrated upon the Anglo-Soviet treaties and the future relations between Great Britain and the Soviet Union, constitutes an unexpected violation of the procedure which we mutually agreed upon.3. As regards the subject matter of Mr. Gregorys note, I declare in most categorical terms that the manifesto annexed to it is a gross forgery and an audacious attempt to prevent the development of friendly relations between the two countries. If, instead of departing from the established practice, the Foreign Office had in the first place approached me for an explanation, it would not have been difficult to convince them that they had been victims of deception on the part of the enemies of the Soviet Union. Not only the contents, but the heading and the signature of the document definitely prove that it is the work of malicious individuals who are inadequately familiar with the constitution of the Communist International. In circulars of the Communist International (which may be seen in the press, for its activities are not concealed) it is never described as the &quot;Third Communist International&quot; for the simple reason that there has never been a First or a Second Communist International. The signature is a similarly clumsy forgery. M. Zinoviev is made to sign himself as the &quot; President of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International,&quot; whereas actually he is, and always signs himself officially as, &quot; President&apos; of the Executive Committee.&quot; The whole of the contents of the documents are, moreover, from the Communist point of view, a tissue of absurdities, intended simply to arouse British public opinion against the Soviet Union, and to frustrate the efforts being made by both countries to establish durable and friendly relations.4. The evident falsity of this document relieves me of the necessity of replying to the conclusion drawn in the Foreign Office note as to the responsibility of the Soviet Government for the activities of the Communist International, since they are based on the assumption that the document is authentic. [763 bb-1]
5;- I protest categorically against this using of false documents against the Soviet Union and also against the violation of the procedure mutually established for the consideration of all incidents which may arise between the two countries; At the same time I express my conviction that the British Government will take the necessary steps to investigate the authorship of this malicious attempt to create a conflict between the two Governments. This will ensure the possibility of preventing in future the recurrence of similar incidents.I have, &amp;c.C. RAKOVSKY.
[N 8271/108/38]M. Rakovsky to Mr. MacDonald. (Received October 28.)Sir, October 27, 1924.I AM instructed by my Government to address to you the following note in addition to my note of the 25th October.While adhering to the repeated declarations regarding the non-responsibility of the Soviet Union Government for any acts of the Communist International, and while abstaining at present from dwelling upon the form and tone of the extra-ordinary note signed by Mr. Gregory, the Soviet Union Government is in the position, and hastens to declare in the most categorical terms that the alleged letter of the Communist International, serving as a basis for the aforementioned note,, constitutes, as has been fully established, an impudent forgery aiming to wreck the Anglo-Soviet Treaties and to ruin friendly relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Great Britain, which are steadily improving.In view of the fact that this forgery has been used in an official document, the Soviet Union Government will insist on an adequate apology, and the punishment of both the private and official persons involved in the forgery.In order to remove alPdoubts regarding the falseness of the said document, the Soviet Union Government, fully appreciating the grave consequences that this forgery might have had upon both countries, emphatically and categorically offers to have recourse to an impartial arbitration for establishing the fact that the so-called Communist International letter of the .15th September is a forgery.I have, &amp;c.C. RAKOVSKY.2484   [12251]
RUSSIA. [November 4, 1924.]CONFIDENTIAL. Skotiok 1.[N 8272/108/38] No. 1.Mr. Gregory to M. Rakovsky.Dear M. Rakovsky, Foreign Office, November 4, 1924.I UNDERSTAND that you saw the Prime Minister on Sunday evening and discussed with him the question of your official note of 27th October, though he had not at the time seen your note of 1st November.Mr. MacDonald explained to you at length the reasons why it could not be accepted and was under the impression that you acquiesced in the position.As your note of the 1st instant was written before the conversation referred to, he assumes that you propose to address him further before he replies.Yours very sincerely,J. D. GREGORY.[791 d-1]
RUSSIA.[November 10, 1924.]CONFIDENTIAL.Section 1.[N 8512/108/38]No. 1.M. Rakovsky to Mr. Gregory. (Received November 10.)Dear Mr. Gregory, November 8, 1924.YOUR letter of the 4th November reached me with some delay, owing to my absence from London. It follows from your letter that Mr. MacDonald has drawn incorrect conclusions from the conversation I had with him on Sunday evening, the 2nd November. I must therefore reiterate that, on the question of our note of the 27th October, I continue to maintain the position outlined in my letter of the 29th October.At the same time, in the course of the conversation I had with Mr. MacDonald, I explained that the third paragraph of our note of the 27th October is incorrectly interpreted by the British Government. It does not contain any insinuations against officials of the Foreign Office. The chief point of departure lies in the question of arbitration, by means of which we are willing to prove the groundlessness of the accusations put forward against the Soviet Government.Yours sincerely,C. RAKOVSKY.[791 k-1]v-:--tit
