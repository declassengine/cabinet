MTOODUCTION. PHEMPLQYMEHT AMD:TRADE POSITION.On the 7th July, the latest date for which figures are available, the Live Register of unemployed persons was -M?  Women  yjL^JSJJrii5 Total774,900       191,500 58,000 1,024,400On the 9th June the corresponding figures were -764,321       200,705 62,439 1/327,515On the 21st January 1924 the figures were -917,792       252,721         81,839- 1,251,822On the 9th July 1923 the figures were -928,254       227,529 69,329 1,223,622These figures show a substantial improvement ever the corresponding position last year when the usual seasonal decline set in remarkably early.     It is probable that   the present figures on the whole represent the best likely for seme time, as normally the seasonal decline wouldbe expected to set in shortly.     The Improvement represents a real improvement, i.e*, the diminution in the Live Register does not represent any great, increase of men taken on for improvised relief work.The Board of Trade anticipate that there will be a continuation of the very slow general improvement in trade that has been developing intermittently for the last two or three years.     While the smaller trades appear at the moment to be in. a better position, the larger industries for a number of reasons are less promising.     The Iron and Steel(i) -    vl .
trade is suffering from a certain amount of foreign competition..     The Engineering and Shipbuilding trades find orders difficult to obtain.     The prosperity if the coal trade largely produced by the Ruhr position is now waning owing in particular to German competition in Northern Europe, and the cotton trade is hampered by the high price of raw material.The fluctuations in the Live Register which have been marked within recent weeks are mainly due to the instability of the cotton trade.,     Egyptian cotton spinners are still well employed, but the weaving section is patchy. There is no prospect however of full time working until cotton is obtainable at a much cheaper price.     Prices of raw cotton have been high owing to weather reports, but the most recent American Bureau Report ,,gave a higher figure for the cotton crop than had been anticipated with the result that there was an immediate fall in the price of cotton. The information on the conditions of growth has not been quite as favourable as the Report suggested and the price is reacting accordingly,     It is too soon to report definitely how the crop is progressing and the prospects of employment in the trade will depend very largely on the price position.Ths wool situation is variable but owing to the firmness of the raw material the position on the (&quot;hole is sound., though there are hot lacking one or two signs of a downward movement in the manufacturing section.
PART____I.Schemes initiated by previous Governments which have been continued and extended by the present Government,I.    MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, The 1923/24 programme of land drainage and water supplyttGEEBR      schemes has now been completed.     387 drainage schemes and 72 ArjigS.     water supply schemes having been carried out.     Actually a&apos;24      larger number of schemes were approved, but s^me had to beXne.      abandoned owing to the consistently bad weather and water con-ait i-ns      The t. tal estimated cost of the schemes carried out75$ of which is wages is  38S;,000),/of which the Government undertook to advance 296,000 in the first instance, a small portion of which (about-. 34,000) will ultimately be recoverable.     The average numberof men per week to whom employment has been given, primarily in rural areas, was 3,800 up to May 12th last, when the schemes were normally intended to end, and 2^90.0 from May 12th to june  30th, the final date for completion..adi- Most of the schemes referred to above were in progress ariFeb. 7th, 1924 hut since that date the total expenditure has been approximately  192,000, of which  150,000 was in wages, .1924c. This figure is, of course, included in the totals given above.The Government have made provision for the continuance of these schemes on a larger scale from October 1st, 1924, a date earlier than that fixed for last year.     The variation of certain conditions will,  it is hoped, lead to a rather larger type of scheme being carried out, but the main thing is that ygi-      the Government have allowed next year&apos;3 schemes to be prepared ramme; during the present summer so that it is expected that moreschemes will be carried out in 1924/25, and that-, in any case, a larger number of schemes should, be ready to start on October1st than has been the case in previous years, when the decision as to the next programme was not announced until early autumn.At the present moment all concerned are engaged on the prepara-tion of the 192i/25 programme for which at present  170,000 has been voted up to March 31st, 1925 as a beginning,  it being distinctly understood that more funds will be asked for asJ,and when required.RLY
* II     M BOARD OF AGRICULTURE j?pa SOQgMHD       . -Drain- luring the year ended 30th June, 1924, some 757radjvement   Land Improvement and Drainage schemes were approved in ne andidean      Scotland.     It was estimated that these schemes would give Works.employment to 3,100 men.     The total cost of the schemesamounts to  93,000,  of which  71,000 represents Trages.During the period 7th February to 30th June, 1924,some 314 schemes have been approved, the total cost of whichwas  17,655.     The area benefited by the schemes is 193,400acres of hill land and 2,535 acres of arable.     About 1,300men have obtained employment.     In addition tc the above, aspecial grant of  4,875 has been made in aid of the HebrideanRoad Works, one result of which has been that the localin Lewis furtherAuthority/has been able to obtain/assistance from the Ministryof Transport-     On the average about 1,100 men have beenemployed on these roads.rain- The Board of Agriculture for Scotland propose   an expenditure of  35,000 on the 1924-25 programme for Land5inane.     Drainage, etc. V/0ik6.     If unemployment remains acute and suitable applicationsfor grants are received on the same scale as in the last two seasons, it may he necessary to ask for additional funds in order to ensure the provision of the full measure of relief which the Vorkr are capable of affording..&apos; of Parliament has been asked to vote  3.00,000 for supplyingiatsJ!ed       at less than cost price, Seed Oats and Seed Potatoes to necessi-Jes cottars,bss-    tous crofters,/etc. in the Scottish crofting counties.     This*s.      assistance has prevented widespread unemployment on the holdingsduring the Spring months, and the harvest resulting will provide employment in the Autumn and a chiof means of subsistence for thepopulation of tho Highlands and Islands throughout the Winter.,-2-
III.POST OFPICE UaEMPLOYliSHT BOHEIiiB.THE 192-3/24 PROGRAMME.THE 1924/25 PROGRAMS.The Post Office schemes for 1923/24 covered -(A) Duct laying for telephone cables, and (b) Post Office London Railway   fl) the construction work, and (2) the electrical equipment.As regards (A) 455 miles of ducts have been laid at a cost of  585,000; 4,000 men being employed for 5 months on the work which is now completed.As regards (B) (l), part of the laying of the permanent way platforms, etc.,  (about  6 months&apos; work) remains to be done.    So far  48,000 has been expended and  79,000 remains to be spent.With regard to (B)  (2) electrical equipment..  All the contracts have been placed, the approximate cost of the w-^rk being  335,000.The total estimated cost of all the undertakings referred to above is  1,042,000,  of which  528,000 has so far been expended, leaving  414,000 to be expended.The Treasury have approved the Post Officeconstruction engineering/programme for 1924/25 at a total ofapproximately  8,250,000.   A supplementary programme isbeing prepared by the Post Office in case the government desire that additional works not covered by the authorised programme should be accelerated.
J1l    EZ3?Ce[r VZZ^S SGHSMB yTha total amount sanctioned ; up to June,.-30tiu-1924^ undor the Export Credits Sohorae is  28,063,677.   . Iha total credits actually granted up to the same date amount to  I0,608vlf3;   The difference between the amount sanc-tionad and tho amount advaneod or guaranteed is partly accounted for by business for which a guarantee had been sanctioned not being financed by tho Government or on Govern ment guarantee and partly by sanctions which have not yet been, but will, in due course, be taken up.     The. guarantee scheme was approved in the spring of 1921 hut little use was made of- it by the commercial public until 1922.   In the summer of that year&quot;, the amount guaranteed reached its peak at about  250,000 a month.   Since June 1923 there has been stagnation in new business, the reasons for which are be-lieyefi to bo general want of business combined with the&apos; nervousness resulting from tho disastrous experiences of traders in so man;/ markets during the slump period;   tho want of knowledge in tho business world of tho facilities offered by the Exports Credits Department and also to some extent to the increased capacity of traders to transact their own business without assistance.     Tho question of giving greater publicity to the, scheme is engaging the close attention of all concerned.The scheme applies to export business throughout the world except British Indi&amp;V Ceylon, the Straits Settlements and Hussia..    With regard to the first throe the Eastern Banks and the Manchester Chamber of Commerce are opposed
to their inclusion and there is also good reason to believe that the existing banking facilities are adequate.As regards Russia, the Department have con-ferred with arcos but the only case submitted has been one relating to the purchase of herrings fabout  50,000) and even in this case the applicants were not prepared apparently to comply with the conditions.     The Arcos Company have approached the Trades Facilities Committee but both in this as in the Export i Credits case the principal difficulty appears to have been one regarding security.There is no reason to suppose that any practice bio changes in the regulations now governing thetExport Credits Scheme would lead to its being utilised more freely.- 4a -
ti 0V,     TRADE FACILITIES- ACT SCHEMES.On the 31st December, 1925, the total Exchequer contingent liability authorised by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922, in r-eepcct of capital was  50,000,000, -u;o. the total amount in respect of which the Treasury had agreed to give guarantees was just 6-^er  58,800,000,     By the recent Trade Facilities Act passed by the Government the amount of the Exchequer contingent liability has boon Increased from  50,000,000 to  65,000,000 and Treasury guarantees have&quot; risen approximately  10,000,000 from  38,200,000 to  43,800,000.Since the 7th February, 1924, the Trade Facilities Committoe have recommended guarantees to the extent, of  8,859,000,     Among the,/principal items are the following:- 2,000,000. 600,000.  400,000,  1,600,000,  600,000,  600&apos;, 000, 850,000.  500,000,The Korth British Aluminium Go, Ltd,Union Castle Steam-ship CfJ!The Anchor Line,Lloyd Sabaudo, Genoa;British and African St8am HaviKation Co.Pacific Steam Kavi-gation Co*Company in Sud^n under Sud-m Government.Equipment of a Power Station and Aluminium Pac tory.For construction of Vessels on the Clyde, .P or - o on a t r uo 11 en of a ship at G0van*For construction of three ships at G$va-n,For construction of a ship at Dnlmuir,For purchase of plant, etc, in Great Britain for construction of vessels at Belfast,-ditto-For the construction of a Railway-

Among these may be mentioned electrical projects from Japan end Greece and reilway proposals from Yugoslavia, Tasmania., Eew Zealand end Australia, but of course it would be premature to say whether any, and if so which, of these applications will materialise,,(MOTE; The latest figures relating to Trade Facilities will be circulated to Ministers prior to the Debate.)  -
VI.  W  OOliTRACTIEG :D3&quot;PA.RH.iSIlT3. DERATION Apart from stjeai&amp;I senemas for the relief ofGVERtliviSH TMOTS.        unemployment undertaken by Departments, the Contracting Departments have been req-u.ested to aooeDerate their contract work so far as this can be dona with due regard to.economy and efficiency.     (there Is no reason to believe that so far as the Contracting Departments are concerned the acceleration of contracts has not been carried out to the fulles t practicable oxtent.The following are instances of the acceleration of the Government contraot workt-MIKISTRY. Since 7th February last the Air Ministry haveleratlon.   accelerated contracts for tho provision of aircraft,aero engines, clothing,  transport,  furniture and works of the aggregate value of approximately  4,400,000; in the result 10,000 men will be continuously employed on aircraft construction; 5,000 men oh engine construction and the works contracts will provide about 12,500 men-months employment.Per The Secretary of State for Air has indicated that ifres forilleviation   the Government can state early that substantially overla&quot; the and above the provision in the cur-rent estimates will be si and3&quot;       made available for the relief of unemployment a programmecan be worked out in the course of the next few months which will produce a substantial increase in the amount nf employment in the aircraft and allied industries. 3 OF lie provision for works in relief of unemployment was made in tho Office of Works Estimate, for 19 23/24 aid 1924/25 to the extent of  289,535   and  66,415 respectively. The whole of the programme, including this provision, has now been practically completed.
Conditions governing the inclusion of the Services in the various unemployment relief programmes were -(1)   That the works were necessary.(2)   That they could be put in hand without much delay. (5)   That the estimated expenditure on labour bore a high proportion to that on material.It may be of interest to note that among other Important works carried out here been the renewal of the electric lighting installations throughout the whole of the Government buildings In Whitehall and the overtaking, to a very large extent, of the arrears of internal and external decorative work which had accumulated during and immediately after the war.     Mention may also be   made of the reconditioning of the bed of the lake in St..James&apos;s Park.er While the Office of Works are unable to give detailedreshe       particulars, it may be assumed that a programme amounting inla-ofloy-the aggregate to approximately  30.),000 could be put in hand and executed in the period October 1924 to March 1925.     In addition there may be &apos;remanet &apos; charges amounting to as much as say  50,000 to be^ met from provision in the 1925/6 Estimates . Among other matters which could be included in this programme are the raising of the standard of decoration of Emplo7/raent Exchanges so far as possible, having regard to the tenure on which the buildings ,are held,     It may further be possible to Include special additional provision.to raise the standard of roads oh Government Housing Estates.     In order to undertake this further programme it will be necessary for additional staff to be engaged and in all probability Parliament would have to make provision by means of Supplementary Estimates for practically the whole of the probable expenditure.
As part of their programme for relieving unemployment in rural areas the Government have decided to extend the activities of the forestry Commission i, nd to inaugurate a new policy combining the general policy of afforestation with the- provision of forest holdings^Approval Las been given for the systematic establishment in future of forest holdings and the provision on reasonable terms of houses and land for the forest holders who will also be guaranteed not less than ISO days work in the forest each year, &apos;She Government have also decided in principle to revert to the afforestation programme contemplated in the report of tho forestry Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee and in the Pores try Act of 1919 and have &quot;authorised in pursuance of this policy the acquisition by the Porostry uommissicn during the current financial year of 50,000 acres of land suitable for the policy of afforestation in association with the provision of forest holdings,The.forestry Commission have also been authorised to carry out Turing the current financial year road-Disking and ether works of a permanent character in the various forests ander the Commission^ control and also forestry operations such &amp;s the planting and preparation of ground and the scrub-clearing of land.     The Forestry Commission have also beoa authorised&apos; to continue to assist by means of grants the development of municipal and private woodlands in- accordance with the approved arrangements under the Act of 1923.
Eb.o adUitich.:;!  expenditure- to be incurred by the forestry Commissl-pii in tne. finsueial year 1924-25 for the pufposes indicated above is estimated at   75,000 v/hioh the House of Comrooae will be invited to vote on the uuypleneritary estimate in due course.The above proposals will enable the Forestry Coaunis&amp;ion to employ 7,000 men in the winter and 2,300 in the summer as against 4,600 men in the winter and 1,300 in the summer under the arrangements now in operation.- 10 &amp; 11 -
Under Programmes authorised by previous Governments between 1920 and January 1924, a total expenditure of  37,250,000 was provided for,   towards this., the Government contribution is to be  22,500,000.On the 1st February, which is the nearest date for which figures are available, there remained to be definitely promised to individual schemes under these programings, a sum of about  4,000,000.   Between 1st February and 30th June,  3,000,000 of this balance had been definitely promised to local authorities for specific schemes, leaving at the tire sent time only a sum of- 1,000,000 still to be allocated to particular projects,    This sum of  3,000,000, which lias&apos; been, allocated in grants during the past five months, may be taken to represent work to the total value of about  5,000,000.Out of the total value of these programmes of  37,250,000, there had boon spent by 30th June an estimated total of  15,500,000, leaving yet to bo disbursed a sum of  21,750,000, -She expenditure during the first quarter of 1924-25(A.e* 1st April to 30th June) on these schemes has beenapproximately  l525G40OO:   and the anticipated future expenditure is somewhat as follows        -1924-25 (remaining nine months) ...  5,500,000 1925-25 .     w, o      ... *  7^000:0001st April. 19 26 onwards ...      0,250,000fhe present Government has itself authorised a farther programme amounting in all to an expenditure of  13,500,000, towards which the Gojernment will contribute nearly  10,400,000-,   2Mb is earmarked for definite purposes as 21,7 50,000IfflB PB0GBAMM3 OF JS3 PASSEC?

In addition, the Exchequer liability in respect of all works approved by the Committee grants on the basis of interest or interest and sinking fund charges for the same period is estimated to amount to  22,000,000o   The capital cost of the works in guest ion amounting to approximately  50,000,000*for the period from 29th June,,, 1923,. to 31st March, 1984, works to the value of nearly  19.,000,000 on the loan basis were approved, for grant and schemes to an estimated total value of over  8,100,000. were approved for grant on the wages basise   In other words1, no fewer than 3,550 schemes of a total value of over  30,000,000 have been  considered in the 12 months ending 23rd June 1924 and it should be noted that the whole of the schemes submitted are undoubtedly of greater public utility than was the case in the preceding years.   Since the Committee started operations no fewer than 8,350 schemes of a capital value of over  50;&apos;&quot;C0,000 have been approved fear grant.   These schemes involve 8,250,000 irsn-months -of direct; local employment and at least as much again In indirect employment in the manufacture of materials for the schemes.
During the period from 7th. February, 1924,, to 23rd. June, 1924, the Unemployment Grants Committee have approved altogether 750 schemes to a total value of about  5c 500,000 which will give direct employment for about 175,000 men-monthso2he Committoe have at present under consideration schemes of a total value of nearly  3 ,.400,000, representing works to be started in the coming autumn and wiater0 In addition a large number of the schemes approved during the present year will undoubtedly continue throughout the winter and steps have been taken to invite Local Authorities to submit further proposals0   While it is as yet too early to be able to form any close estimate of the volume of fresh proposals to be put/ forward in response to the CommitteeEs invitation, there is good reason to believe that the number and value of the schemes which, eventually, the Committee wi l assist the grant will at least equal, for the winter of 1924/85, the satisfactory figures of the winter 1933/34o
1.    MIHI-^J-RY OF_AGRICULTURE,As a result of repeated appeals which have been made the Government have accepted the principle of a certain measure of financial assistance towards putting in order the main trunk cf the River Ouse from the mouth to Brownshill Staunch, including training the river into deep water.    The whole question is now the subject of discussion between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ouse Board and a preliminary meeting ha3 already been held.It is hoped that this action on the part of the Governmen will not only result in putting thill great river in a proper state, thereby protecting one of the most valuable areas in England against flooding, but will also result in a permanent settlement of the disputes which have been   going on forgenerations between the Uplands and Fen interests,As has already been announced the Government have decided to reelsim a small area of Crown foreshore on theshores of the Wash, about 7 miles from. King&apos;s Lynn; so as to arrive   at some definite conclusion as to the cost of reclamation work generally.     The question of the tender to be accepted for this wort&apos;, is still under consideration-.scheme a initiated by the present Government.
0   NOTE:Cabinet 40 (.24) Conclusion 9,     It will be remembered that while the Government have approved the principle of a State grant, the question of &quot;the&quot; precise form in &apos; which Stata- assistance- should be given-Is still;undor cons ideation,tStjgAR BEET. The Government have accepted in principleproposals for the^grant of State financial assistanceto the Sugar Beet industry for the pureoae of extending and developing that industry and assisting in the relief of rural unemployment.If these proposals are put, into operation there is reason to expect that at least 6 new sugar beet factories will be out in bond at, once.     Each new factory would, cost at least  200,000, of which  150,000 would represent the cost of plant and machinery.     A considerable amount of work would be provided, therefore, for the engineering industry, and it is understood that the whole of the machinery required could be supplied by British manufacturers.Each factory would employ 500-600 men during the manufacturing season from October to January,     In addition, each factory would employ 50-60 men all the year round,     The growing of beet for six new factories would require an additional area  of 24,000 acres in the first year, and, as it is generally agreed that each 10 acres of beet requires an additional man, employment&apos;would be provided for 2,400 more men on the land,     Moreover, additional labour would be required, to satisfy the increased, demand for trans-port facilities which would arise with the development of the industry.An extension of the sugar beet industry will, therefore, have a material result in providing additional employment on the land, in the factories and in some of the trades which are most hardly hit - e.g. the engineering trade.
ii.FISHERY BOARD FOR SOOrLAMD.The Pis.hery board for Scotland are carrying mt?heriaen      a scheme of loans for fishermSa, for the purchase of herringNormally the amount of the loan Is 50$ of the cost of the nets to be provided, with special terms for sx-Service men.     If advantage is taken c-f the scheme it will enable fishermen to obtain for their industry additional capital up to  150,000, on moderate terms, and will result in improved employment, notonly in/herring fishing industry itself, but also in those branches of the trade engaged in the handling and curing of fish and in the net making industry.r the rchase Herring ift, Netsdrift nets.Parliament has voted a sum of  150,100 for the purpose.the

If Local Education Authorities respond to the Board&apos;3 invitation a considerable amount of work will be provided in the building and other allied trades, The Board are working in close consultation with the Ministry of Health ao as to avoid any difficulties which may arise through competition of building labour as between the provision of houses and educational buildings.The Board, on 18th June last, issued a circular to Local Education Authorities stating that they are prepared to consider proposals from those Authorities to make byelaws under Section 46 of the Education Act, 1921, requiring children to attend school till the end of the school&apos;term in which they Attain the age of fifteen.     The Beard have also invited the members of the Juvenile Organisations Committee to undertake as soon as possible, in conjunction with the local Juvenile Organisations Committees, a full review of the problem of unemployment amongst school leavers and. it is hoped that they will be able to devise means for mitigating the moral and mental deterioration which must follow in their case upon a prolonged period of unemployment.The Local Education Authorities have power, under Section 86of the Education Act, to aid schemes of this general character.and the Board have already informed the Authorities that theyare prepared to consider on their merits1 proposals for thispurpose.     If the proposals are approved the expenditure would rank for a $0 per cent grant from the Board.- 21 -
IV. ELECTRICAL DBVKLOP^BKT.The Government arc convinced that no solution of the unemployment problem is possible without a great revival of British trade and industry.   The lowering of British costs of production Is a condition precedent to any such revival, and. extensive developement of elect-rival undertakings will tend/ e marked degree to reriuce the cost of production and will also relieve-unemployment by providing a very large volume of work for skilled men in certain industries.The Government are advised, that the best andmost practicable methods of stimulating electricaldevelopment are:- I(1)   The attainment of one standard frequency throughout the country; and(2)   The laying of main transmission lines coupledin certain cases with distribution systems In areas where such, lines do not exist and would not be laid in the ordinary way in the near future.To secure standardisation throughout the country it will be necessary to alter the present frequencies onthe north-east coast, on the Clyde, in Birmingham and. theSouth-west Midlands District, in parts of London and InSouth Wales.   The change over in these non-standard areas will entail considerable ord; rs for new electrical mach-machinery, living work to skilled men.   The electrical advant-ages of the proposal are two-fold:-(1)   otandardisation will enable electrical manufacturers to reduce the numbers of their stocks and patterns, thus cheapening products and assisting manufacturers to oompete with other countries;(2)   Inter-connections of the capital generating stations throughout the country will be greatly facilitated,    Such a national policy of inter-connection means increased efficiency and economy and greater security of supaly.
Frequency standardisation throughout the country would probably take from three to five years to carry out.   As the change over will confer no immediate direct benefit on those interested in the production and consumption of electricity it will probably be necessary to effect the reform on the basis of a substantial proportion, if not the whole of the cost, being borne by the Exchequer.With a view to the earliest possible decision being taken, the Government have arranged for an expert report on the whole matter to be furnished forthwith. It is expected that this report will be ready in October next.   If the report is favourable, the Government will then be prepared to consider whether a substantial pro-portion, if not the whole, of the direct cost of the provision and installation of new machinery, etc., which will be required should be.,borne by public funds, and to take immediate steps to secure the practical good-will and. co-operation of the parties concerned.GTRICAL To produce electricity cheaply it la necessarySMISSIOH ;to concentrate Its generation in large stations anddistribute it at high tension to sub-stations.   Further-more the main stations should be Interconnected.   The high cost of transmission lines is a great obstacle to such development and tends to Cause the provision of such lines to be delayed until they are immediately profitable. Accelerated electrical development pre-supposes the laying of-transmission lines well In advance of immediate re-qulrementB.   It will be understood, however, that main transmission lines connecting different districts oannot be usefully laid until, under the scheme mentioned above, the frequency of the two districts has been made the .same.    A certain number of transmission lines., however, within districts whore the frequency is already standard
&quot;and lines -i^^ the-purpose-^jT&quot; distribution.-in areas where electricity i3 not available can be under-taken apart from the standardisation of frequency mentioned.in the first paragraph.The Government have decided to authorise the Electricity Commissioners to confer with the Muncipal and Industrial Electrical Associations with a view securing the maximum development of the main trans-mission system on the following terms: -(a) 3ork to be assisted to be main transmission lines as defined in Section 56 of the Elect-ricity (Supply) Act, 1919, and subject, as mentioned in (b) below, to substantial schemes of distribution in areas where electricity Is not available,(b)(b) The work must be of a kind which the undertakers have no intention in the near future of carrying out with their own resources and must not be accelerated work in the ordinary sense or mere additions to or extensions of schemes already in operation. *(c) The financial assistance to be given to consist of a grant to local authorities or companies undertaking approved works individually or jointly sufficient In amount to make up the net revenue (after allowing for depreciation or sinking funds) attributable to the particular work to a rate of interest (approved by the Treasury) on the expenditure incurred until such time as the net revenue is sufficient to meet this charge, or for ten years whichever Is less.The Government have given most careful andanxious consideration to the very important questionof railway electrification.. The problem is beingexplored to. the fullest extent and every effort hasbeen made to press on the Railway Companies thedesirability of undertaking any proposed electrificationat the present time with a view to relieving unemploy-ment.. &apos; . ,
V,     SEVERS BARRAGE.The Water Power Resources Committee in their Third Interim Report on Tidal Power dated 1st December 1920 drew attention to the desirability of investigating the possibility from the commercial standpoint of utilising the tides for motive power purposes, with particular reference to the Severn.     The Committee on the information before them wore not in a position definitely to recommend a scheme but considered there was ample justification for a further and more detailed enquiry into a number of difficult technical and economic problems.During the economy campaign consideration of the Committee&apos;s proposal was: postponed. . The Government have however revived the matter.    It is clear that a scheme of a barrage across the Severn, if practicable, could not be used to allsviatedaemploymerit existing at present or in the near future, but the matter is one of the greatest importance from the point of view of coal conservation and the development of natural resources.   The immense reservoir of power that would be provided if the scheme were practicable would ad\d definitely to the industrial capacity of the country and ft is accordingly entirely in keeping with the attitude of the Government towards the problem of unemployment in the future that a careful examination should be made of the project.,At the request of the President of the Board of Trade a small informal Committee were asked to advise as to the nature and scope of the enquiries which 3hculd be undertaken and their probable cost.     The Committee have reported that exhaustive survey and investigation are necessary to enable the Government - to arrive at a conclusion as to(a) the practicability of a barrage;     and 1(b) -  its possible effects on o ttier -interests in the riverespecially navigation but Including also land drainage and fisheries...
Including the investigation which is 111 he necessary into the crucial question of foundations and the survey end the preparation of a preliminary power scheme &quot;based on the &amp;?-. ta obtained should they be favourable, the enquiry would tcke a minimum period of three years and cost between  75,000 and  95,000.In view of the great advantages to be derived if tho scheme were found practicable and the necessity of taking all steps possible to improve the industrial efficiency of the country with a view to meeting foreign competition, the Government have decided to authorise the enquiry.The enquiry can be conveniently divided into stages which will reveal the practicability of the scheme and the extent to which further expenditure may be necessaryaThe first stage would be an immediate geological survey of the formation of the neighbourhood of the alternative sites which have been proposed for the barrage and a report before the end of this year as to the possibility of constructing a barrage on one or more of the three sites proposed on the assumption that safe foundations exist.    It must be mentioned that the building of a barrage on the Severn would be one of the most difficult engineering feats ever attempted.The next step would be to ascertain whether it is possible to find safe foundations for a barrage at a point suitable for the purpose in view.     Until necessary borings have been made it is impossible to answer this question and the experience already gained with the Severn Tunnel as well as the geological formation in the lower valley of the Severn indicate that the selection of a possible site, may not be easy and that the necessary borings will be difficult to make.
While the geological survey and the consideration of the engineering problems&apos; were proceedings arrangements would be made for boring operations for the spring of 1925, but the work would not be actually begun unless the consulting engineers report favourably by the end of the year.   If the report as to the engineering practicability was unfavourable it would obviously be waste of money and effort to proceed with the boring.     The cost of the geological survey and the consideration of the consulting engineers report would be between  2,000 and  2,500 and the boring from  10,000 to  15,000.     The total experimental expenditure therefore on the first stages being from  12,000 to  17,500.
