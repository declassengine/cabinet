THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CABINET,SECRET.CP, 487 (24).IMPERIAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEE.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The attached report of an Inter-Departmental meeting was circulated by my predecessor to the previous Cabinet, but its consideration was prevented by the Dissolution. I am circulating it again now, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, together with observations on the various points raised in the memorandum(1) Terms of Reference.     It is suggested that in the first instance there should be these limited terms of reference&quot;To consider the possibility of improving the methods of preparing for market and marketing within the United Kingdom, the food products of the oversea parts of the Empire with a view to Increasing the consumption of such products In the United Kingdom and promoting the interests both of producers and consumers&quot;.This might be approved, I suggest, as it has beenaccepted by the Dominions concerned.   If the Committeesucceeds in its first venture, all parties will be the morewilling to give it a wider scope.Chairman.   I agree with the suggestion thatthe name of Sir Halford Mackinder should be proposed tothe other parts of the Empire concerned.   This was our original intention.(3) British representatives.   If Sir Halford Maokinderis appointed Chairman, I think It only reasonable that weshould propose to appoint only three of the ordinary membersof the Committee instead of the four originally recommendedat the Economic Conference,   I suggest that the nomination of these three should be left to the Board of Trade.   Itwould probably be a good thing if one of the 1*fe was anofficial or ex-official: and, though I do not think It
6dGshould be laid down that one should be a oo-operator, I am disposed to think that Sir Thomas Allen, who happens to be a Director of the Wholesale   Co-operative Society, would be a useful member.(4) Representation of Colonies and Protectorates. Similarly, the appointment of these representatives might be left to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the lines laid down in the memorandum.(5) Expenses.   It might be considered, perhaps, whether in the circumstances the Government should not be more generous than is suggested in the Memorandum and offer to pay, at the outset at any rate, the whole of the expenses of the Committee apart from travelling and other personal expenses of the representatives of the overseas parts of the Empire, for which I understand most of the Dominions are prepared to make themselves responsible.   The expense is very small.   It will be considerably less than the cost to the Dominions of sending experts to assist in the inquiries. We have always paid the general expenses of the Imperial Shipping Committee.(Intd) P. LIBoard of Trade,13th November, 1924.
