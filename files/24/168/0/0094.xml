CHINA;[November 12, 1924,]CONFIDENTIAL.Section 1.[F 3783/174/10]No. 1.Memorandum Respecting the Boxer Indemnity Bill.AFTER the Boxer rising of 1900 the Chinese Government were called upon to pay an indemnity to the Powers concerned for damage sustained and military expenditure incurred. The total amount was fixed at 450,000,000 taels, or  67,500,000. The British share of this total was 50,620,545 taels, or  7,593,081 15s. This debt was to bear interest at 4 per cent, per annum. Owing to changed con-ditions and to the decision of other Powers, such as the United States of America, Japan, France and Russia, to remit their shares of the indemnity.. His Majesty&apos;s Government decided to adopt a similar policy; and on the 20th December, 1922, His Majesty&apos;s representative at Peking informed the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty&apos;s Government would devote the proceeds of the indemnity to purposes mutually beneficial to China and Great Britain.For this diversion of the funds from the purposes laid down under the Finance Act of 1906 legislation is necessary. A Bill was accordingly prepared in 1923 and would have been introduced, had not the general election intervened. The same Bill was adopted by the late Government and introduced in May 1924 (Bill 197). In the committee stage certain alterations were made, and the further progress of the Bill was once again interrupted by a general election. It is now proposed to reintroduce the Bill as amended (see annex).The balance of the indemnity (principle and interest) amounts to  11,186,547  payments being spread over twenty-three years from 1923 to 1945. The payments are at present being deposited in *W British bank at Shanghai, pending decision as to their utilisation.It will be observed that the Bill now provides for the appointment of a statutory committee, to advise the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as to.the allocation of the funds and the best means of securing their satisfactory administration.Foreign Office, November 12, 1924.A Bill to make farther Provision for the Application of Money paid on Account ofthe China Indemnity.BE it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows  1. (1) Any sums received at any time after the 1st day of December, 1922, on Application account of the China indemnity shall, instead of being paid into the Exchequer and ^ff^ issued and applied in like manner as the new sinking fund, be paid to a fund to be n omm 7&apos; called &quot;the China Indemnity Fund,&quot; and, subject to the provisions of this section, be applied to such educational or other purposes, being purposes which are, in the opinion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, beneficial to the mutual interests of His Majesty and of the Republic of China, as the said. Secretary of State, after consultation with the advisory committee to be established under this Act, may from time to time determine.(2.) For the purpose of advising the said Secretary of State as to the application of the China Indemnity Fund, there shall be established an advisory committee consisting of ten persons, who shall be appointed by the said Secretary of State, and of whom at least one shall be a woman and at least one shall be a citizen of the Republic of China.(3.) Any expenses incurred by the said Secretary of State in or in connection with or for the purposes of the administration of the China Indemnity Fund shall be defrayed out of that fund.Annex.2487   [778 m-l]
(4.) The said Secretary of State shall cause to be prepared, in such form as the Treasury may from time to time direct, in respect of each financial year an account showing the receipts and expenditure in that year in respect of the China Indemnity Fund, and the said account shall be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and shall, together with his report thereon, be laid before the House of Commons as soon as may be after the end of the year to which it relates.&apos;. short title 2.-(1.) This Act may be cited as &quot; The China Indemnity (Application) Act,and repeal.     -\ r\c\A &quot; 6 Edw. 7,       18^*.c. 8. (2.)
