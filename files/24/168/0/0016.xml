I attach a memorandum which 1 had intended circulating to the Oabinot in regard to tho question of guaranteeing a loan to the Soviet Union.     Since it was written I have received from Mr. Ponsonby a copy of the proposed Treaty and I have on tho instructions of the Cabinet had an interview with M. Rakovsky.I told M. Rakovsky that I regarded the draft Treaty 3,a being entiroly unsatisfaotory and that in my personal opinion no Government could take the responsibility of presenting to Parliament such a document.    Making it clear that I was speaking  for mysolf and was not in any way committing my colleagues I recommended IvL Rakovsky to continue his negotiations with the bondholders and other olassos   of claimants.    I indicated that if he should find it possibls to roach a satisfactory settlement of their claims it would bo open to him to ronew his request for a British Government guarantee to a Russian Loan,Such a request would have of course to bo considered by tho Cabinet as a&apos;whole on its merits and in the light of tho circumstances prevailing at tho time.P. 8.TREASURY. S.W.
RUSSIAN -TREATY.I.    Mr. Ponsonby&apos;s memoranda gives no precise indication what the terms of the proposed Treaty with  Russia are to bo.    In any agreement provision has to bo made to deal withfa) Pro-war public debts...............  40 millionsnominalfb) Properties owned by British subjootsin Russia................. claim  160 millionsfo) Trade debts due to British firmsfrom Russian firms now prevented from paying, etc   ...............  35 millionsfd) Value of Siberian Bank Shares owned by His Majesty&apos;s Government, whioh oost over............................    1 million.So far as tho Treasury is aware, tho draft Treaty makes no concrete suggestion whatever for any payment in respect of these debts, and contains a number of statements on the principles which His Majesty11 s Government aro to recognise as governing their settlement whioh will bo extremely embarrassing, not only for Russian debts but for debts due from other countries - Turkey, Roumania, Bulgaria, and possibly oven Allied debts.with regard to war debts to His Majesty1 s Government (about  660 millions), the British claims are postponed but the Soviet are not called upon to abandon their wholly ridiculous counterclaims and incidental claims such as 8 millions gold made over under tho Versailles Treaty, and it is clear therefore that they may to raised against us at any moment subsequently.^&quot;urthor,
Purthor, It appears to be intended to hand or err-unconditionally to the Soviet- the unexpended&apos;balanoes of our  4 millions of advances by the British Treasury to the Imperial Russian Government for war expenditure.    Ihese moneys were not spent by the Imperial Rusaiion Government on the purposes for which thay were lent, and should naturally revert to the British taxpayer,II.    (a)    It ia often said that an agreement with Russia would assist unemployment in this country.   The total British exports, to pre-war-finss^a.  i.a^ jjwluaJngPnlana  and other districts now no longer included in Russia -(excluding re-exports of foreigg and colonial produce), was In 1913  18 millions, (of vhich&apos; slig htly over half was manufactures) out of a total of United Kingdom exports of  525 millions.    The corresponding figures in 1928 for post-war Russia were  3,600,000 out of a total of  719-1-millions, and in 1923,  2-^- millions out of a total of  767 millions.    Having regard to the separation of Poland -a predominant manufacturing portion - from pre-war Russia, and the inability of Russia to export grain &apos;Xn large quantities, a trade with Russia:.amounting to any s ignifleant proportion of British exports is: not in sight.(b)    Russia at the present time can obtain short-term commercial credits, which are the obvious means of financing ordinary exports, without any great difficulty; in fact, she is believed to have considerable balances -not less than  10 millions - at the present time in the United Kingdom.(o)
J. G o(o) TChat she cannot ohtaln are longer for working capital In Russia (and It Is algnlfioant that shb doos not propose to spend the wholo of nor guaranteed loan here In any case) or for longer term purchases from this oountry.(d) When asked to give I standee of suoh longer credits, the Hussian Delegation, whllo mentioning In vague tarns a figure of  13 millions, wore only ahlo to produoo ooncrote oases of slightly over  2 millions.(e) This contribution of Russia to unemployment Wold have, under the present proposal, to he provided In faot hy this country, In tho form of a loan, and would therefore occupy money which, if not lent to Russia, would almost certainly ho used In other foms of industrial production la this country.III.  Mr. Ponsonhy talks of a guaranteed loan of  30 millions.    This Is a very largo amount.  Ho foreign country or dominion has placed a loan tfl:53hglajnd; la., recent years for so large an amount.    The largest recent guaranteed loan plaoed I in Englandoperation would&apos;&quot; a &amp; things with the entlro City, and all likely suhsorlherB to loans, aotlvoly hostile.    It Is almost ImpjBSihlo/to see how such a loan oould ho underwritten, and, if It wore underwritten, the Into re at rate would have to he fixed at a comparatively high figure.30
To issue a British guaranteed loan at an unusually high rate would depreciate all existing British stocks, whether guaranteed or other-vise;   it would make it impossible to place trade facility loans for unemployment on anything like their present basis of about 4f^;   it would make it impossible to raise money at a reasonable rate for housing;   it would make it out of the question to endeavour to reduce the interest charge on National Eebt by conversions.     The net effect would be to hamper industry by putting up interest all round and greatly reduce the power of the Government to finance unemployment measures.It is submitted that these very serious results would be impossible to defend in the House of Commons or in the country, and would immeasurably outweigh any advantage which could result from such a treaty as the Foreign Office appear to contemplate.IV,     It should be pointed out that His Majesty^ Government have no power whatever to promise a guarantee to a loan, even contingent, without specific authority from Parliament.     It is clear that a promise which, when the time came, the Government of the day might not be in a position to implement, would merely produce accusations of ill faith.     A promise, even contingent, without parliamentary authority, would be wholly unconstitutional and would certainly be attacked on that ground in the House of Commons.It must be remembered also that the annual charge for interest and sinking fund on a loan cff even  10 millions mightbe getting on for  1,000,000 a year.     It-is......quit What securityihas the British taxpayer for this liability?     It is quite certain that a general charge on Russian revenue - which wouldbe
be obviously quite unenforceable - would be useless.     A specific charge on a given revenue (e.g. Customs), though also unenforceable, might be slightly better, but Russia has shown no signs of offering any such security.
