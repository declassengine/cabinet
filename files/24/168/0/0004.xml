THIS JPOPTOT. IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S QOVERNMBNT. BEOBET.CABINET.0.P.404 (24) --nPROPOSED SALE OF OHEPSTOW SHIPYARD.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Chepstow Shipyard was part of the National shipyards Soheme and was sold early in 1920 to Messrs. Sperling &amp; Company for the sum of  600,000 of which  110,000 was paid in cash, the balance to be secured by a mortgage on the land, buildings and fixed plant.   Interest on this balance has been paid up to the 30th September, 1922, sinoe which date it has been in default.In aooordanoe with the terms of the Sale Agreement, the Monmouth shipbuilding Company was formed to acquire the property. This Company has now ,boen without work for some considerable time and besides its liability to the Government is heavily indebted to the Fairfield Shipbuilding Co., and another Company in the same group; in the ordinary course it will be compelled to go into liquidation in the near future.The position has been closely watched in order to protect the Exohequer interest in the property, and it is now olearthat a ohoioe has to be made between the two following ooureesi-(i) Resuming possession of the land, buildings and fixed plant in the Yard and disposing of them to the best advantage, or(ii) Acoepting an offer of  25,000 oash which has now been made by the principal private creditor, viz., the Fairfield shipbuilding Company.The offer of the Fairfield shipbuilding Company provides for a olean out settlement of all outstanding questions with the original purchasers of the property in 1920 and for the release of the Government from its present liability to -supply power&apos; from a power station at Beaohley at a loss of from  2,000 to  5,000 per annum.Ohepstow Shipyard was built during the War under Admiralty dlreotion and oost about  1,350,000, including unfinished work and other waste expenditure; this figure had no real relation
to the value of the property when sold in 1920 and still less to its present market value.   It is understood that many ship-yarda are to-day working at a loss and any purchaser of Ohepstow would have to regard it as a liability rather than an asset for some time to come unless able to put the property to some other immediate use.The recent offer for sale of the Forth Shipbuilding Company&apos;s Yard at Alloa is an indication of the heavy depredaticr in values which has taken plaoej this Yard probably cost several hundred thousand pounds, but was twice put up to auction at upset prices of  30,000 and  25,000 respectively without an offer^being reoeived,Ohepstow shipyard oovers an area of about 47 aores on the right bank of the Wye adjoining Chepstow Town; its resale cannot in any way interfere with any plans for the use or disposal of the Government properties at Deaohley, which oover an   area of-754 arwes, and are situated on the peninsula formed by the other bank of the Wye at its junction with the Severn.   The proposed sale does not include the two villages of Hardwick and Bulwarks at Ohepstow and numbering about 400 houses built by the Government in oonneotion with the National Shipyards Scheme.   These are at present held by another Company formed by the original purchasers and will be returned to the Government.Sir Prank Baines, Director of Works, H.M. Office cf Works, (who has acted as Adviser and has supervised work at the Shipyards sinoe 1919) has been asked to give some idea of the break-up or dispersal value &quot;of the plant at Chepstow ard from his figures it appears that the net results of such a sale might result in the ultimate reoeipt (say within 3 years) of a somewhat higher sumthan the present offer but realisation on a break up sale oanv&quot;only be a matter of estimate and, in view of the delay involved
in that method, of dealing and unforeseen difficulties and expenses which may arise, it is not recommended that, this method be adopted.Lord Maclay, who was Shipping Controller until March 1921 and has since acted as Adviser on liquidation matters, thinks that in all the oircumstances the Government would be adopting the bast course in accepting the present offer. It is understood the purchasers hope to put the property to practical use in the near future and thereby provide employment - in the district where unemployment is at the present time serious.After full consideration of the whole position, I consider that the offer of  25,000 by the Pairfield ship-building Company for Chepstow Shipyard be aocepted, but i submit the question for the Cabinet&apos;s decision in view of the previous discussion (Cab.39(24) 22(b))..(Intld.) S.W.Board of Trade, 19th July, 1924.
