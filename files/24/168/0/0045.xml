Period ended July 28, 1924.THE unemployment figures given in the Table in Part I (A) of this report show an increase since the 23rd June of 34,479. This is the first increase reported since January of this year in the monthly figures. Last year a similar depression occurred in the corresponding period, but then the change was less pronounced, the increase of unemployment during July 1923 being 9,433. The sudden and severe depression in the coal mining industry is mainly responsible for the present increase, and this is very marked on account of the falling off in export trade accentuating the normal seasonal slackness in the demand for home consumption. Other contributory causes are normal seasonal depression, extended trade holidays, some depression in the woollen textile industry, and, to some extent, the stoppage of work in the building trade. The increase in the live registers for juveniles is partly due to the fact that the end of a term fell within the month, and many juveniles leaving school registered for the first time.T.

The employment position in the coal-fields generally has shown a further heavy decline during the month. Reports indicate extensive short time working and the temporary closing of mines in many districts. The slump is largely the result of diminished foreign demand occurring at a time when the seasonal slackness in the home consumption is most pronounced. The Northumberland, Durham, and Cumberland fields have been very severely affected. In the Midlands the employment position varies considerably in the chief coal-mining centres. In the Nottinghamshire field there has been improvement during the month; trade in the North Staffordshire area continued fairly good and business improved in South Staffordshire. At Walsall, West Bromwich, and Coventry, employment remained [11.978] &apos; b 2
good but short time work prevailed at Coalville. In South Wales, where approxi mately 242,000 colliery workers are normally employed, 8,400 were totally unemployed, and 11,600 were engaged on short time at the end of the period under review. In the North Wales field approximately 19,000 men are normally engaged and there has, for some time, been an increasing demand for labour, but the change in the position during the month resulted in 5,000 new claims to unemployment benefit from these workpeople. A number of large Welsh colliery companies continue to work at full pressure with prospects of regular employment for many months, but in numerous instances smaller companies are working on day to day orders&apos; and uncertainty prevails.In Scotland depression has been very pronounced and all classes of coal have been in poor request. The export demand has greatly decreased and this has badly affected the East Fife coal-fields.Stone Quarries. There is no change to report. Employment generally remains good.China Clay. Employment remains good in the skilled occupations, but the surplus of labourers already reported has not been absorbed.Iron Mines. The employment position continues bad.Tin Mines.-There is no change to. report. For some months there has been slow improvement.IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION.The employment position in this industry is bad and further depression in the trade has been apparent during the month. The Cleveland pig iron market continues to decline. In Sheffield the trade was quieter than at any period during the present year. The majority of open-hearth furnaces in the district are idle and production has been substantially reduced. At Workington steady employment was maintained in the manufacture of pig iron, but depression occurred at the steel works. The improvement at Barrow reported last month has not been maintained. In the North Staffordshire area trade is still fairly good, although there have been indications of a decline during the month. Irregular short time work is prevailing there. Further depression occurred in South Staffordshire. At Bilston nearly 2,000 men were thrown out of work in consequence of the closing down of steel works. Increased unemployment was recorded at Brierley Hill, Corby and Wellingborough. At Ilkeston, Chesterfield, Sutton-in-Ashfield, and Oakengates, iron and steel workers were fairly well employed. In Scotland the demand for bar and pig iron was very quiet; employment&apos;declined and works were closed for extended holidays. New orders were difficult to secure and it is reported that considerable quantities of continental material are being used in the shipyards. Unemployment in this trade increased in Wales, but the orders already on hand resulted in the depression being less severe than in other parts of the country. Several Welsh steel works were closed during the month and there were indications that other firms would shortly have to close down.TIN-PLATE TRADE.The employment position continues good. Trade has been well maintained and exports continue to increase.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The slight improvement reported during the last few months has been main-tained, and generally there has been slow re-absorption of labour. Orders for new tonnage are reported from Barrow, Pallion and Wallsend, and the employment position shows improvement generally on the North-East Coast. Reports from the Mersey-side indicate increased slackness in both new and repair work, but at Barrow additional men were re-engaged in the shipyard. On the Clyde, fifteen vessels were launched during the month and employment was fair, but the demand for ships is stated to be slackening. New orders were received at Aberdeen, Clydebank and Ayr, but other districts reported a scarcity of orders. On the South Coast employ-ment is reported to be fairly good at Woolston and Dartmouth. Ship-repairing yards in the South Wales ports continue slack, with the exception of those in Swansea, where the improvement reported last month was well maintained.
ENGINEERING.Motor and Cycle Engineering. The employment position remains good generally, the demand for highly skilled operatives continues, but some indication of seasonal depression occurred during the month in some of the main centres of this branch of the engineering industry. In London and the South-Eastern Counties, the high level of activity was maintained, although firms manufacturing motor omni-buses were slack. There has been no apparent increase of unemployment in the Oxford area during the period under review. In the Midlands the usual seasonal slackness has commenced in some districts, particularly in connection with the motor cycle trade. Unemployment has increased slightly at Coventry, Redditch, Derby, Wolverhampton, Sparkhill and Selly Oak. At Birmingham, Nottingham and Dudley, firms are busy.  -General Engineering. The employment position on the whole remains bad. The majority of the local reports concerning this industry are encouraging and show that improvement continues, although progress is very slow and somewhat irregular. In the North-Eastern Counties some advance was made during the month, especially in the locomotive, electrical and marine sections. At Elswick a contract from India for forty-seven locomotives and a contract from New Zealand in connection with a large electric power scheme, has resulted in reduced unemployment. At Hebburn, the Live Register for this industry is lower than it has been for three years, in conse-quence of the marked activity in the manufacture of electric switch gear. On the other hand, engineering firms which specialise in coal-mining equipment have received a set-back in consequence of the slump in coal-mining. In the North-Western Counties the improvement has been maintained on the whole, but there has been a noticeable slackness in the locomotive sections at Crewe, Horwich and Openshaw. Electrical engineers, machine tool makers and printing machine makers continue to be fully employed. The textile machinery industry is still very depressed. In the Midlands trade is good at Beeston, Chesterfield, Basford, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Leicester, Coalville and Peterborough; moderate at Long Eaton, Nottingham. Birmingham, Darlaston, Wednesbury and Wolverhampton; and bad at Handsworth, Smethwick, West Bromwich, Kettering and Loughborough. In London and the South-Eastern and South-Western Counties this industry is maintaining steady progress. Reports from Scotland indicate that trade is generally quiet, but that increasing overseas business is being obtained. In Wales, the position has been affected adversely by the slump in coal-mining, but trade is certainly not worse than in the previous month.TEXTILES.Cotton. No important changes in the employment position occurred during the month, but the rapid rise in the price of raw material during the second half of the period had a disturbing effect on trade, and sales of both yarn and cloth fell away to negligible quantities. In the spinning branoh of the industry, employment continued good in the Egyptian (fine spinning section), and organised short-time working remained in general operation in the American section. In the weaving trade employment was erratic; while some towns benefited from cloth orders placed in May and June, in others the depression became intensified. In the Yorkshire cotton towns a further decline occurred, and increased unemployment resulted during the month.Woollens and Worsteds. The depression previously reported in the wool-combing section has been followed by depression in the spinning section, and during the month unemployment has increased in nearly all the Yorkshire centres, and the outlook generally is reported to be discouraging.Hosiery. The employment position generally remains bad on the whole and further depression has occurred during the month. Trade is fairly good at Basford and Nottingham, and good at Mansfield and Stamford. At Loughborough there has been a marked increased demand for underwear and a consequent demand for labour. At Leicester employment is fairly good for women, but continues slack for men. Increased unemployment was reported from Ilkeston, Burton-on-Trent, Coalville and Sutton-in-Ashfield.Lace. The employment position in the Midland Counties remains bad and further depression occurred during the month.
Silk. The employment position generally remains fairly good and some-improvement occurred during the period under review. At Leek the position was fair, and considerable improvement occurred in certain sections. At Longton trade remained good. The artificial silk trade at Nuneaton and Derby remained in a flourishing condition, and there was very little unemployment amongst men and women engaged in that part of the industry.Jute. There is no change to report. The employment position at the beginninc of the month was fairly good.   ,Carpets. The trade at Kidderminster has not changed during the month. While some slight depression appeared to set in, the employment position remains fairly good. A certain amount of irregular short-time working, particularly amon&quot; women and girls, was in operation, but the extent of time lost was not very great.BUILDING AND BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.At the beginning of July the employment position in the building trade was very good as regards skilled operatives, but there was still a surplus of unskilled labourers unemployed. On the 5th July the position was entirely changed by a stoppage of work due to a dispute between the National Federations of employers and work-people in the trade. The stoppage mainly affected the larger firms who are members of the Federation and considerable unemployment was caused, but the numerous smaller firms who are not affiliated to the trade organisations have absorbed large numbers of the skilled men concerned in the dispute. Employment remained good generally in the brick and tile industry, although in a few instances slackness was caused in consequence of the building trade dispute.CLOTHING.The unemployment position generally remained good. In the West End of London dressmaking and ladies&apos; tailoring trades were well employed. In the East End ladies&apos; tailoring slacked off, but the men&apos;s tailoring showed much activity. No material change occurred in the Provinces and the position is satisfactory. The commencement of seasonal depression was evident in some districts.BOOT AND SHOE.&apos; Further depression occurred in this industry in the Midlands and London and the employment position is poor. At Norwich employment remained good, and further improvement was reported at Kingswood.POTTERY.Employment continued slack on the whole, but there was a tendency towards improvement during the month. Trade in the china and earthenware sections is still depressed, but employment is better in the tile, sanitary-earthenware and fire-clay sections. Employment in china works at Derby increased and activity was main-tained in the porcelain works at Worcester, where there is a demand for labour.TRANSPORT.There is little change to report in the position as regards dock transport workers. There has been increased employment in the North-Eastern ports owing to the activity in the timber trade. The report from Southampton indicated an appreciable increase of unemployment.
III. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia^ New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion Authorities concerned. In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land have been agreed with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A number of organisations, having as their object the provision of facilities for the settlement of immigrants in certain of the Dominions, have also been assisted. An extension of this assistance to other organisations is under consideration.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the month of June (with the corresponding figure for June of last year) and for the three months ended the 30th June, 1924 and 1923 respectively, are set out in the following Table : Monthly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The empire settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.

(C.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after ^he Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund.1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923. -Payments during Year.

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and (b) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.

Juveniles.After the Armistice, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in certain localities to deal with the problem of unemployed juveniles. After a period of closure centres were again established, and the cost, which was originally shared by the Board of Education and Local Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the 31st March, 1924, partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to 75 per cent, in respect of approved schemes, the Local Authority providing the remaining 25 per cent. From the 1st April, 1924, the Exchequer Grant will, as an, emergency measure, so long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains at its present scale, be raised to 100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local Education Authorities.Approximate Net Expenditure from Aimistice to March 31, 1924.
