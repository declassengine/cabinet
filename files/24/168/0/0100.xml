CRET.,497 (24).CABINET.PROPOSED COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH GERMANY. Njoto, by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the oonsidoration of my colleagues the attached Memorandum which has beon prepared after consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   It will be soen that a Cabinet decision is required on three important questions of policy before the negotiations with Germany oan be carried further.The matter is one of great urgency as the Secretary of State for Foroign Affairs has instructed Lord d&apos;Abernon to Invite the German representatives to come to London at a vory early data.   It Is essential that the negotiations should be carried on and concluded without dolay.   A number of the economic Clauses of the Treaty of Vorsaillos which govern our present relations with Germany lapse on the 10th January next.   Moreover Lord d&apos;Abernon has advised that we are more likely to get a satisfactory Treaty if we oan conclude the negotiations before the Reichstag meets.Tho questions on which a Cabinet decision is required are as follows:-(l) Tho Germansdesire an assurance that differential duties will not be imposed as they were under Part II of the Safeguarding of Industrios Act.   For the reasons set out in the Memorandum I am in favour of giving such an undertaking on merit.   Differential duties aro Inconsistent with Most Favoured Nation treatment, which it is the object of the proposed Treaty to secure.
(2) The Germane ask that legislation shall be promoted by H.ia. Government to sweep away the particular disabilities affecting ex-enemy aliens and not other aliens, that Is to Bay the prohibition   of Germans and other ex-enemies (a) engaging in backing (b) engaging in-trade in non-ferrous metals and (o) serving on British merchant ships.   For the reasons stated in the Memorandum I am In favour of agreeing to remove all these disabilities.(3) The maintenance of the 26 per cent. Reparation Recovery Aot Levy.   Tho Chancellor of the Exchequer is strongly in favour of maintaining this levy on financial grounds.    I am equally strongly in favour of maintaining it on the ground that it is one of the effoctive ways of ensuring that German industry is adequately taxed.P,L1*-Q.
PROPOSED COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH GERMANY. The main object pursued by this country in the negotiation of commercial treaties is to secure British trade and shipping against discrimination and in particular to provide(a) that goods originating in, or destined to, this country shall secure full most-favoured-nation treatment in every-thing that regards importation, exportation or transit, especially of course in the matter of Customs duties and prohibitionsj(b) that British subjects are treated at least as favourably inall respects as the subjects of any other foreign country, and, In regard to taxation, as the nationals of the country with which the Treaty is concluded,?(c) that British shipping is treated in all respects on thesame basis as national shipping.The Treaty of Versailles secured these advantages in Germany for all the Allied countries, but the Articles by which they are secured are all of a more or less temporary character.The Articles relating to Allied goods,   Articles 2(34-267 of the Treaty, will expire automatically on January 10th next, being 5 years from the date when the Treaty came into operation.   The Article relating to the treatment of allied nationals, Art. 276 of the Treaty, will also expire on January 10th next, unless before that date a majority of theIICouncil of the League of Nations extend its operation, with or without amendment, for a further period not exceeding five years.   The Article relating to navigation (Article 327 of the Treaty) is  also liable to revision by the Council of the League of Nations at any time after January 10th next.In view of these circumstances it has seemed desirable to proceed as soon as possible with the conclusion of a direct
p C&apos; nL&apos; c/ i.jTreaty with Germany by which the above advantages at least shall be secured to this country, and some months ago a draft Treaty was submitted for the consideration of the German Government,   This Treaty was, speaking generally on the lines usual in commercial treaties, but it contained two special features which also were included in the Treaty with Austria, which has been signed and is now awaiting ratification.In the first place it contained an Article by virtue of which short notice could be given at any time to the German Government of the intention of His Majesty1s Government to impose special duties on German goods in the event of German currency being depreciated and unemployment resulting in the United Kingdom. The Article provided that if such notice were given, the German Government would have the option of terminating the Treaty when the notice expired and the special duties on German goods were imposed.   As regards this Article it will of course be recalled that the provisions of the Safeguarding of Industries Act relating to the imposition of special duties on countries with depreciated currencies have expired, so that no action of this sort could in any case be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government without further legislative authority.In the second place, the German Government were required to sign a declaration by which they recognised the right of His Majesty1s Government to maintain   against their nationals certain special disabilities which&quot;were Imposed upon ex-enemy aliens by war time legislation in this country.   These disabilities are;-(1) The exclusion of Germans from the business of bankingfor a period of five years after the termination of the war, and thereafter unless Parliament otherwise&quot;determine.(2) The exclusion of Germans from dealing in   non-ferrous metals in this country for a definite
period of five years. (5) The prohibition of the employment of Germans on any British ship. To this prohibition there is, under our legislation, no time limit. The five-year period referred to above comes to an end in August, 1926.At preliminary conversations whioh have already taken place the Germans took strong exception to both of these provisions.   They declined to Bign any Treaty whioh even by implication suggested the possibility that their currency might again become depredated and they declared that it would be altogether impossible for them to sign a treaty so long as their nationals were liable to special disabilities which did not apply to other foreigners. Differential.Duties.It is clear that the German refusal to oonsider the possibility of duties being imposed on their goods which are not also imposed on other foreign goods is not unreason-able and that we cannot expect to secure ourselves against discrimination in Germany unless we agree not to discriminate against Germany.   Any attempt to discriminate is in fact inconsistent   with most-favoured-nation treatment.The deoision to be taken on this question is, however, closely bound up with the polioy the Government intends to pursue for safeguarding industries, where a oase for such protection is proved.   If it were our policy simply to renew Part 2 of the safeguarding of Industries Aot, a liost-Pavoured-Hation Treaty would be impossible.   I hope, however, that the Cabinet will prooeed on rather different lines.   Looked at merely from the point of view of safeguarding industries, I
am strongly of opinion that a renewal of Part 2 with its    1 differential duties is a bad method of prooedure.   As I-understand our policy, it ia that no duty should be imposed, unless an industry, which is itself efficient, can prove that it is, or is likely to be, seriously injured by abnormal foreign competition..   Such abnormal competition may be due to depreciation of exchange, or to the fact that a foreign industry is working longer hours at lower wages, or to excessive dumping, or to a combination of these and other causes.     While therefore we ought only to act aaoep-ir in a clearly proved case, we ought not, I suggest, to confine our ground of action to depreciation of exchange. Again, Part 2 of the Safeguarding of Industries Act was exceedingly difficult to administer and was only partially effective.   Exact proof of the effect of a depreciated exchange is almost impossible.   Where an order was made against a&apos;particular country, it was necessary to require certificates of origin, not only from that oountry, but from other countries around its borders.   Nor could an order be made against any country with which we hcd a Host-Favoured-  -Nation Treaty without denouncing the whole treaty.For all these reasons I think that enyone, who has had experience of administering that Act, would strongly recommend that, where it is necessary to safeguard an industry; this should be done by means of a general duty on the imports of that industry.   In these circumstances I am strongly of opinion, both in the interests of treaty relations and in the interests of our own industries, that we should decide definitely against differential duties.
&apos; v KJ  *JDifferential treatment of ex-enemy aliens.Similar considerations apply in the matter of the par-ticular disabilities imposed on ex-enemy aliens.   The difference is that in this case legislation would require to be passed before we could place German subjects on the same footing aa other foreigners.   It is therefore important to know how far difficulties might be likely to arise in passing such legislation; and steps were taken by my predecessor to get into touch on the matter with the Inter-ests likely to be affected.   Certain members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council have been consulted on the general question of trade interests; one or two banking members of the Advisory Council have been Interviewed in regard to the restriction on banking; and interviews have also taken place with an influential representative of non-ferrous metal interests, with shipowners and with Mr. Havelock Wilson of the seamen s Union.   The result of these Interviews has been to show that no material opposition noed be apprehended to the withdrawal of the special disabilities affecting banking and the non-ferrous metal trades, provided a satis* factory treaty is presented at the time their removal is proposed.  Aa regards the prohibition affecting seamen, the shipowners will certainly raise no objection to its removal.   Indeed some of them have already been pressing for such removal, as they are unable to secure an adequate share of the passenger trade to and from Germany owing to their inability to engage German stewards.   The difficulty if any, of removing this prohibition, is likely to come rather from the men; but Mr. Havelock Wilson has stated that he personally has no desire to make difficulties, provided the employment of Germans on British ships at wages lowor than those authorised by the Maritime Board, is effectively prevented.   This proviso gives riso to no
w ty kjdifficulty as Section 5 (2) of the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act, 1919, definitely prohibits any such wage discrimination.In these circumstances, I am of opinion that we should give an undertaking to introduce legislation to withdraw all the above restrictions.Whilst it is true that ratification of any commercial treaty cannot be carried through until the necessary legis-lation to give effect to it is passed, lt would be well that the Treaty should at least be signed before, or at any rate soon after, January 10th next. Once the Treaty is signed, it is not likely that Germany will seek to discriminate against British subjects or British goods so long as she has reason to believe that we mean to proceed seriously with the steps necessary to its ratification. Indeed on September 29th a decree was issued in Germany which secures most-favoured-nation treatment to the goods of all countries which in fact accord similar treatment to German goods.   This decree is not limited in time but only provides for the treatment in question to be accorded until further notice.   It does, however, indicate that the policy of the German Government at present is opposed to&apos;discrlmina-tion without special reason.
Reparation Recovery Levy.Throughout the negotiations the Germans have been pressing for the substitution of some other system for the Reparation Recovery Act levy,   The Treasury attach great importance to maintaining the levy in its present form.   They insist on this, In order that receipts received under the Act may be treated as reparation In kind and therefore not subject to foreign priority.   They further contend that, under the present system, they have an effective means of collecting all that is due.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer will no doubt deal with this in more detail.From the point of view of the Board of Trade I should strongly press for the maintenance of the present levy, or an equally effective alternative, as I regard the levy as one sure means of securing the taxation of German industries.Assuming that the demand for the variation of the levy Is withdrawn, and that the German wishes in regard to the Safeguard-lng of Industries and the special disabilities affecting German subjects are met, there is a good hope of being able to arrange the details of a Commercial Treaty which will not only contain the usual provisions, referred to at the beginning of this memorandum, as regards discrimination against British trade and shipping, but will be accompanied in addition by some assurances regarding the favourable treatment of British trade in the future, and secure the early removal of tho existing system of prohibition of importation which has done so much to render trade with Germany impossible, as well ao the grant of special concessions in favour of British Shipping Companies and trade agencies, British banks and British insurance interests.P.LlrG.
