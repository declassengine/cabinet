[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.    August 1924.)SECRET.CP. 432(24).I circulate a private, telegram, dated 30th July, from the Viceroy regarding the constitutional position in Bengal. I also circulate ray private telegram of the Kith July in order to indicate the particular points under discussion.OLIVIER.1st August 1924.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 16th July 1924.2018. Private and. personal. Your private and personal telegrams of 11th and 15th instant. It seems we are somewhat at cross purposes. There have been two distinct questions: (1) Whether Governor-General in Council can declare over head of dissenting Governor that emergency exists. My private and personal telegram of 11th July was intended to deal solely with this question, and as I understand that Lytton now accepts your view on it, it is unnecessary to pursue it;(2) In my telegram of 9th April I said that it appeared to me, as then advised, impossible to contemplate or defend in Parliament the final adoption of a policy of wholesale dismissals, the dismissals then in question being both in the Medical and in the Education Department. This view was founded on regard both to the public interests dependent on the efficiency of those two departments, and to the moral obligations of the Government towards its employees on grounds of public faith which it would be contrary to the public interest to repudiate. The scope of issues involved has since been narrowed by provision made for Medical Services. The second question then is whether situation as regards education can be dealt with as emergency under proviso (b) to section 72d 2. I concur in your view that there is a case of emergency. On this line it rests with Governor to decide what is necessary for carrying on the department and this is a question of degree. In para. 6 you suggest that I should express an opinion. In so far as the question of what is necessary does not appear to have been canvassed in Legislative Council on its merits, I agree with you that what is necessary may prima facie be presumed to be what is required to carry on the work of the department on the normal approved standard, lint the Governor might perhaps be on stronger ground if he would agree to adopt the recommendations of the Retrenchment Committee to the extent to which he would have adopted them if conditions had been normal in pursuance of the promise made by the Minister in Bengal Council on 28th March. The final decision must of course rest with Governor. You have my authority to inform him of my views.The further question whether revocation of transfer should be resorted to may have to be dealt with both in Bengal and in the Central Provinces. From the point of view of principle, I am myself much disposed to think that if the situation in either province is prolonged, this line may have to be taken. It appears to me justifiable on the broad ground that whereas subjects were transferred to the control of the Legislative Council to be dealt with responsibly on their political or financial merits, tire Councils have refused to deal with them on this basis and have attempted to deal with them not in the interests of efficient public administration, but as mere opportunity for exercising pressure on the Government on a wholly separate issue. The constitution intends that subjects are devolved to be dealt with responsibly ; to exercise under such circumstances as have arisen the reserve power of withdrawing them from transfer would appear to be entirely in the spirit in which the constitution was conceived.From Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 30th July 1924.Private and personal. Please refer to your private and personal telegrams 2018, dated 16th July, and 2040 of 21st July. Lord Lytton has been with me in Simla for four days, and we have very fully discussed the situation, lie accepts the views on which you and I are agreed regarding the question of emergency and interpretation and also as regards meaning of carrying on a department, and is, I think, convinced of our views. 1 am glad I invited him as our conversations have been very satisfactory. 7526     100  8.24
He will put demand for grant ,of Ministers salaries before his Legislature again on 26th!August. He still has hopes that Bengal Legislature may reconsider their previous decision and vote the&apos; salaries, but the prospects of success are not so good as they were on 7th July, If the vote for Ministers&apos; salaries goes through the Educational grant will be voted without difficulty.If the Ministers&apos; salaries are not voted, they will resign. Lytton will then carry ,on their departments for a time under the Transferred Subjects (Temporary Administration) Rules, as waS&apos;done in the Central Provinces. No case will arise in Bengal for some time for recourse to the use of Devolution Rale 6.As regards the Central Provinces, we are considering whether steps should now be taken under Devolution Rule 6 to revoke or suspend the transfer of provincial subjects. As I have indicated before, if we must take this action I incline towards suspension as the proper course, but I am not disposed to take it until Bengal votes on Ministers&apos; salaries have been decided.
