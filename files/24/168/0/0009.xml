Report by Lord Parmoor on the Twenty-ninth Session of the Council of the League of Nations.The Council of the League of Nations began its twenty-ninth session at Geneva on Wednesday, the 11th June. The session lasted until the evening of Tuesday, the 17th June.In addition to the full meetings of the Council, four of its Sub-Committees on the Protection of Minorities, on the Financial Reconstruction of Austria, on the Financial Reconstruction of Hungary, and on the Scheme for the Settlement of Greek Refugees  held a number of meetings. ^The Austrian Committee of Control and the Financial Committee of the League&quot; also held meetings during the session.The conduct of the business of the Council was facilitated by the greatly improved arrangement of the Council Chamber, which had been made by the Secretary-General since the last meeting.The following is a summarised account of the business dealt with by the Council: I. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION. Austria.The Council gave further consideration to the important questions raised before its last meeting by the request of the Austrian Govern-ment for modifications of the programme agreed to in the Geneva Protocols of October 19-22.It will be remembered that the Austrian Government had requested the Council to agree that the budget figure, at which under the protocols budget equilibrium was to be established, should be raised from the figure of 350,000,000 gold crowns originally estab-lished, and secondly that they should be authorised to use for general productive investment any surplus of the loan raised under the protocols not required to meet budget deficits. At its last meeting the Council decided to invite the Commissioner-General and the Financial Committee of the League to carry out an enquiry into the present position of Austria, and to advise the Council as to whether the modifications desired by the Austrian Government could be agreed to.At its present session it was reported to the Council by the Financial Committee that this enquiry had been begun and that the results so far attained justified certain tentative conclusions. The Financial Committee were, for example, of opinion that the ultimate figure a,t which budget equilibrium could be established might be above the 350,000,000 gold crowns originally agreed to, and with this conclusion both the Austrian Committee of Control and the Commissioner-General, Dr. Zimmermann, were in agreement. All these authorities were, however, clearly of opinion that it was not possible yet to fix the exact figure. They, therefore, instructed the Financial Committee and the Commissioner-General to continue their enquiry in the hope that it might be possible to determine at
the next session of the Council a new maximum figure of budget expenditure. All the authorities were, however, agreed that what-ever figure might ultimately be accepted, further drastic economies in present expenditure were required. The Council therefore adopted a resolution expressing the earnest hope that during the period before the definite fixing of the new budget figure, the scheme of reforms, which the Austrian Government had originally accepted, would be pursued with vigour.With regard to the utilisation of any surplus of the Austrian loan which is not required for meeting budget deficits, the Council were again not able to take any definite decision. The Austrian Committee of Control and the Financial Committee of the League were at one in thinking that it would be premature to discuss the matter before budget equilibrium on a permanent basis had been established. The Financial Committee further recommended that, if any new investment of any part of the loan were agreed to, such investment would have to take due regard to the several rights and interests involved, and would have to be subject to the control contemplated by the protocols.The Financial Committee and the Commissioner-General, in laying their conclusions before the Council, expressed the view, with which the Council itself was in complete agreement, that the collaboration of the Austrian people as a whole in the policy of reform, would be the most effective means of expediting the date at which the Council could terminate the League control of the Austrian budget, which in the terms of the protocol is to be brought to an end &quot; when the Council shall have ascertained that the financial stability of Austria is assured.&quot;Greece.At its meeting in March the Council authorised its Greek Sub-Committee to hold a meeting at any date which might be agreed to with Mr. Morgenthau, the chairman of the Greek Eefugee,; Settle-ment Commission. It was then anticipated that important decisions might be required in order to enable Mr. Morgenthau&apos;s Commission to secure for the Greek Government the further loans necessary for the continuance of its work. Such in fact proved to be the case. During the month of April Mr. Morgenthau requested the members of the Greek Sub-Committee to meet in April. The meeting actually took place on the 7th May, under the presidency of the British representative. Mr. Morgenthau himself and M. Diomedes, the Governor of the National Bank of Greece, attended the meeting.At this meeting it was reported by Mr. Morgenthau and M. Diomedes that they had succeeded in reaching an agreement with the Bank of England for a further short-term loan of  1,000,000 for the continuance of the work of their Commission. The only condition attached to this agreement was that the Council of the League should definitely decide to carry the work on to a conclusion. This decision the Sub-Committee, acting under its authority from the Council, were only too glad to take, and money was therefore made immediately available to Mr. Morgenthau and2287 Wt.--- 1500 7/24 F.O.P. [11797] b 2
his colleagues. Mr. Morgentb.au reported that with these new funds &quot;his Commission would be able to continue their work until the late -autumn, by which time it was anticipated that a further long-term loan could be arranged.At the present Council meeting a report was received from the &quot;Refugee Settlement Commission in which the further valuable progress of the work of the Commission was recorded. The report, which is &quot;a document of great practical interest, emphasises the main principle upon which the Commission&apos; have based their plans, namely, that the only general solution for the refugee problem in Greece lies in augmenting as much as possible the agricultural productivity of the country, trusting to the repercussion of this on its general economic life to provide employment for the urban refugees. It gives details of the houses constructed by the Commis-sion, the families settled, the supplies with which these families &quot;have been provided, &amp;c. Among other things, the statistics show that during the period the 1st January to the 30th April, 13,000 refugee families were settled in Macedonia, Thrace and old Greece.The report of the Commission once again emphasises the diffi-culties which result from the poverty and malnutrition of the refugees, while they are waiting to be settled, and from the -devastating ravages of malaria. The Council, therefore, thought it right to endorse once more the resolutions agreed to by its Greek Sub-Committee, appealing for the continued assistance of the -charitable public in the mitigation of the sufferings of the refugees.The Council further heard suggestions put forward by the Greek member of the Eefugee Commission, M. Argyropoulos, for the modi-fication of the protocols under which tho Refugee Commission is established. They undertook to give these proposals their most eare-ful attention before the next meeting of the Council in September.Albania.At its meeting in March the Council received an appeal from the Albanian Government for assistance from other Members of the League to enable it to combat the famine raging among the mountain population of its northern provinces. The Council then agreed to make an appeal to the Members of the League to enable a small and gallant people to meet a serious crisis, and in order that funds might be immediately available they agreed, on the motion of fchp Italian representative, to make an immediate payment of  2,000 from League funds. They were happy to learn at their present meeting that in addition to the  2,000 just mentioned the following contributions had been received : SwedenItaly............Czechoslovakia... International Bed Cross... International save the Children Fund Certain citizens of the United States Spain  ...        ...        .&apos;.Great Britain  ... Roumanian Red CrossS.... 10,000 Swedish crowns.!. 025... 500,000 lire...... 5,000......... 500. . 5,000 Swiss fr.           ... 200,.....        ... 001... 10,000 dollars...... 2,300... 10,000 pesetas           ... M.....         ...    &apos;   ... 5,000... 10,000 lei      ...... 10
It will thus be observed that apart from an important gift of maize from the.Roumanian Government, a total of ^16,535 had been received in cash a larger sum than at its meeting in March the Council had thought to be necessary. It was, however, further reported by M. Pittard, whom the International Red Cross had at the request of the Council nominated to administer the funds in Albania, that further sums would still required to enable the inhabitants of the famine-stricken p-c*mees to re-establish their agriculture on a self-supporting basis. The Council therefore agreed to call the attention of other Members of the League to the facte given in M. Pittard&apos;s report, so that they might, if so disposed, con-tribute towards the fund; and to invite M. Pittard or his representa-tive to return to Albania as soon as possible to continue the work of administering the relief funds on behalf of the League.Hungary.At its meeting in March the Hungarian Committee of the Council were able to reach agreement concerning the scheme, for the financial reconstruction of Hungary, and the necessary protocols were signed on the 14th March, 1924. That, however, was only the beginning of the practical.work which had to be carried out if the scheme was to have any chance of success. The Council were, therefore, very happy to learn that since its last meeting the system of League control for the Hungarian budget had been established; that Mr. Jeremiah Smith of Boston, United States of America, had accepted the post of Commissioner-General; that after consultation with a League delegation a bank of issue had been founded; that the assets assigned for the service of the loan has been freed from all prior charges, so that the service of the reconstruction loan is to have definite and clear priority; that the Hungarian Loan Delegation had made satisfactory progress with the negotiations for the issue of the loan, the proceeds of which are to cover the deficit on the budget during the transitional period of reform; and that the Hungarian Government had already made a real beginning in carrying out administrative reforms and economies. The Council also heard an encouraging statement from the Commissioner-General, Mr. Smith, who informed them that the Hungarian tax returns had been showing an improvement which gave much encouragement for the ultimate success of the scheme.They were also very happy to learn that the negotiations for the issue of the loan were on the point of being concluded in such a manner that the .entire amount required,  11,500,000, would be obtained. To this result the London market largely contributed. The Council were also informed that Italy had given a splendid lead to the continental countries by undertaking to provide a substantial share of the loan. In view xif these results, which ensured the full success of the Hungarian scheme, the Council felt justified in accept-ing the advice of the Financial Committee, and in giving to the Reparation Commission an undertaking that it would carry through to a conclusion the reconstruction plan contained in the protocols of the 14th March.  This undertaking was required by the Reparation
Commission as a condition of their releasing their claims upon Hungarian assets. It now appears certain that the.speed with which the Hungarian budget is balanced will depend only on the progress made by the Hungarian Government in executing the programme of reforms to which it is pledged;II. POLITICAL QUESTIONS.Delivlitation of the frontier beticeen Albania and the Serb-Groat-Slovene Kingdom in the region of the Monastery of Saint Naoum.During its session the Council of the League received a letter from the Conference of Ambassadors, in which the conference, on behalf of the Principal Allied Powers, invited the Council to consider a point which had arisen in connection with the delimitation of the frontier between Albania and the Serb-Croat-Slovene Kingdom in the region of the Monastery of Saint Naoum. The point at issue was in many particulars similar to that in the ease of the frontier between Poland and Czechoslovakia in the region of Jaworzina, which had been finally settled by the Council at its last meeting.  The Council, therefore, readily agreed to the request of the Conference of Ambas-sadors.  In the papers forwarded to the Council by the Conference it was explained that the Allied Commission appointed by the Con ference of Ambassadors, in accordance with the resolution of the Assembly of the League of the 2nd October, 1921, to delimit the Serbo-Albanian frontier, had at that time reported in favour of allo eating the Monastery of Saint Naoum to Albania.   This reeommen dation was in accordance with what was believed to be the intention of those who delimited the Albanian frontier in 1913, and was endorsed by the Geographical Committee of the Conference of Ambassadors.   The Conference itself had, therefore, decided in December 1922, that the frontier should be so delimited as to give the monastery and the surrounding region to Albania. Since the date of that decision, however, the territory in question had continued to be occupied by Serbian troops, and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State had persisted that the decision was not justified.   The members of the Conference of Ambassadors, who in 1922 had been unanimous in according the monastery to Albania, were now divided in opinion, and they therefore requested the Council of the League to reeoni-mend the solution which might seem to them just. The Conference suggested that there was a preliminary legal question which required investigation, namely, whether the decision taken by the Conference in December 1922 ought to be considered by the Allied Powers, and accepted by the parties, as irrevocable.  The Conference of Ambas-sadors suggested that this question might be referred for an advisory opinion to the Permanent Court of International Justice.To this course the Council readily agreed. The question as defined by the Conference of Ambassadors itself was referred to the Permanent Court. The subsequent consideration which will be given to the matter by the Council at its next meeting will depend on the answer which the Permanent Court may in the interval return.
Mixed Arbitral Tribunals between Hungary and. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Roumania, and Hungary and the Serb-Croat-Slovene Kingdom.Shortly before it met the Council, received a request from the Hungarian Government that in the discharge of its duties under the Treaty of Trianon it should choose Presidents for the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals between Hungary and Czechoslovakia, &amp;e., &amp;c.Fortunately, the matter called for no decision by the Council, as it was reported to the Council that the Governments of Hungary and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State had agreed on a President, while the Governments of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Eoumania informed the Council that they had agreed to make a further effort to find acceptable Presidents for their respective Mixed Arbitral Tribunals. The Council expressed the hope that these efforts might be successful before their next meeting.III. ADMINISTRATIVE COMMISSIONS.Danzig.There were eight questions relating to the Free City of Danzig on the provisional agenda circulated to the members of the Council before they met. Some of these questions concerned important and long outstanding matters of dispute between the Free City of Danzig and Poland. Happily it was not necessary for the Council to take any of them into consideration, for the reason that the Governments of Poland and. the Free City desired to settle their disputes as far as possible by direct negotiation.It was reported to the Council that the two parties had, with the assistance of the League High Commission succeeded in reaching a provisional agreement on every outstanding point. The Council, therefore, for the first time in all its sessions was not called upon to consider any matters relating to Danzig. The Council thought it right to send their congratulations to the two Governments and to the High Commissioner.Soar Valley.1. It will be remembered that at the last meeting of the Council the Governing Commission reported that it had been their intention during the financial year 1924-25 to increase the existing force of 355 local gendarmerie by an addition of 500 men, but that the financial crisis through which the territory was passing had obliged them to reduce this programme to an increase of 200 men.The British representative, having been informed that the inhabitants of the Saar Valley were willing to bear an additional taxation if that were necessary to enable the full increase of 500 to be carried out, had proposed at that meeting that if the financial situation should improve before the end of the current year the matter should be reconsidered and a further increase made beyond the 200 promised by the Governing Commission.It was now reported to the Council by the Governing Commission that in fact the financial position of the territory had greatly
improved as the result of the recovery of the French franc and that in consequence the Governing Commission were of opinion that they would now be justified in making an immediate increase of 400 in the gendarmerie. The Council expressed their satisfaction at this result.2. The British Government drew the attention of the Council to a communication made to the League, on the 8th April, 1924, by the chairman of the Saar Governing Commission, dealing with the refusal to confirm certain appointments to the School Board of the town of Saarbruck. The British Government did not desire to question the propriety of refusing to confirm these appointments nor the manner of that refusal, but they wished to take exception to the actual wording of M. RauhVs letter&apos;which gave it the form of a communication from himself to the Council, on his own responsibility, without any indication that he was writing on behalf of the Commission as a whole or that the Commission had been in any way consulted or asked to indicate their approval. The British delegate therefore asked the Council once again to enunciate clearly the principle that it was the Commission as a whole that was answerable to the Council of the League, and suggested that all reports to the League, though signed by the chairman, should be made formally on behalf of and with the responsibility of the whole Governing Commission. The Council agreed that the principle of collective responsibility must be maintained and that future reports should be framed with proper regard to that principle.3. Shortly before the meeting of the Council a letter was received from the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs protesting against the action of the Saar Governing Commission in limiting the importation of goods duty free into the Saar from Germany under section 31 of the annex to articles 4S-50 of the Treaty of Versailles. That paragraph provides that &quot; for a period of five years from the date of the coming into force of the present treaty, articles imported from Germany into the territory of the Basin for local consumption shall be free of import duties.&quot; Latterly, the Governing Commis-sion had required that a certificate of destination must be.produced in respect of every consignment of goods to be imported into the Saar from Germany, and since the beginning of the year, it was alleged, such certificates had only been granted in isolated cases. Thus considerable quantities of goods which, it was claimed, were entitled to benefit under the paragraph quoted, had been refused admission in direct violation of the treaty.The Council had before it the observations of the Saar Governing Commission on this complaint of the German Government. The principal point made by the Commission was that the words &quot; local consumption&apos;&apos; referred solely to the local consumption of the Saar during the five-years&apos; period ending on1 the 10th January next. In point of fact, they maintained that German firms were establishing new agencies throughout the Basin and importing quantities of materials largely in excess of what was required for immediate local consumption, with a view to accumulating stocks for disposal subsequent to the 10th January, 1925.   This, they
declared, would in practice defeat the intention of the treaty. They further sought to justify their action by quoting representations made by old-established Saar traders, who saw their business threatened by the presence of large stocks of imported goods.The case was presented to the Council too late to admit of a detailed examination, and it was decided to postpone it to the next session. It the meanwhile, the Secretary-General was instructed to communicate to the German Government a copy of the letter from the Governing Commission stating their case.IV.-PROTECTION OF MINORITIES. 1. At its meeting in March the Council had approved the general principles proposed by their Sub-Committee for the settle-IImeat of the question of the expropriated German &apos;&apos; colonists&apos;&apos; in Poland. These principles, originally proposed by the British member of the Committee, Lord Phillimore, provided for the payment by. the Polish Government of a total lump sum to be distributed among the &apos;&apos; colonists &quot; by a Committee representative of themselves. The Council also suggested that the Committee should meet again within a short time and bring to a final conclusion its delicate negotiations with the Polish Government.In accordance with this recommendation, Lord Phillimore and his colleagues met again in Paris in April, and, after considerable discussion, reached agreement with the Polish representatives as to the application of the principles above indicated. They further agreed that Captain Godfrey Phillimore should go to Poland as the expert delegate of the Committee, to arrange with the Polish Government the sum of money which should be given as compensa-tion to the &quot;colonists.&quot;The Council were happy to learn from their Committee that Captain Phillimore had successfully carried out his mission to Poland, and that he had succeeded in reaching a complete and satisfactory agreement with the Polish authorities. Captain Phillimore himself gave an account to the Council of his negotia-tions, and explained in detail the basis on which his agreement was founded.The settlement come to would secure for each &apos;&apos; colonist&apos;&apos; an average sum of  220. Captain Phillimore explained that he had only agreed to this sum after a very careful examination of more than 250 individual cases, concerning which he. had received all the necessary papers and full information from the &apos;&apos; colonists themselves. He explained, moreover, that while the general average of compensation would be . 220 per &quot;colonist,&quot; many of the &quot; colonists &quot; would not be entitled to this full sum, and that there-fore those who had a larger claim would be entitled to more than the average amount of compensation.Both Captain Phillimore and the Council Committee felt that in some individual eases there might be a certain degree of hard-ship ; that is inevitable whenever a large number of individuals are compensated on a general basis and from a single lump sum.  The
Council were, however, satisfied that, by the arrangement proposed justice would on the whole be done to the claims of the &quot;colonists,&apos;&apos; and they accordingly approved the arrangement and congratulated the Polish Government, their Committee, and Captain Plrillimore, on a-satisfactory termination of what had been for many months a most troublesome question.In view of the criticism directed against the settlement in certain German quarters, the British representative felt it right to make before the Council a detailed statement of the reasons for which lie accepted the settlement, and believed it to be just.2. The Council also received a report concerning the negotia-tions being conducted in Vienna between the German and Polish Governments concerning the rights of citizenship of Germans resident in Poland. It will be remembered that these questions had been in dispute for a considerable time, and that at its last meeting in March the Polish Government agreed to carry on negotiations in Vienna under the presidency of Professor Kaeekenbeeck, President of the Upper Silesian Arbitral Tribunal, with the condition that, if the parties could not reach agreement, Professor Kaeekenbeeck should be empowered to give arbitral decisions which would be binding on the parties.It was now reported to the Council that the negotiations had been in progress in Vienna since the end of April, and that the parties had found it necessary to invite Professor Kaeckenbeeck to arbitrate on a number of the principal points involved. It was hoped that his arbitral decisions would shortly be available, and that the parties would then be able to draw up a comprehensive convention based on the principles which he laid down.The Council had, however, to consider a complaint lodged by the German Government to the effect that the Polish authorities were prejudicing the course of the. negotiations and imperilling then-success by legal and administrative action against persons of German race resident in Poland, whose nationality depended on the result of the negotiations. The German Government gave to the Council details of a number of cases in which they contended that the Polish Government had taken legal proceedings against such persons. The German Government expressed the opinion that this action constituted a violation of the pledge given by the Polish representative to the Council at its meeting in March, to the effect that nothing would be done to prejudice the interests of any indi-viduals whose nationality might depend on the result reached at Vienna.The Polish representative replied that in no ease had any such persons been expelled from their properties or from Polish territory; that if administrative action had actually been taken it was only in eases where it was clear that the nationality of such an individual in no way depended on the Vienna negotiations; and he repeated the assurances of his Government that no fait accompli would be created. He further undertook, in response to an invitation from the British representative, that all those cases cited by the German Government would be re-examined in the light of the assurances
given by himself and by his predecessor to the Council in March, and that if errors had occurred they would be rectified. Noting these assurances with satisfaction, the Council expressed the hope that the Vienna negotiations might be carried on to a. speedy and successful conclusion.V.-CONTROL OP ARMAMENTS IN AUSTRIA, HUNGARY AND BULGARIA.On the request of the British Government the following item was placed on the agenda of the Council: &apos;&apos; To consider the position of the Council of the League of Nations in regard to Articles 159 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, 143 of the Treaty of Trianon and 104 of the Treaty of Neuilly.&quot;Under these articles it is provided that &apos;&apos; Austria (Hungary, Bulgaria) undertakes to submit to any investigation which the Council of the League of Nations, acting if need be by a majority vote, may consider necessary.&quot;In bringing the request of the British Government to the notice of the Council, the British representative said that, in the opinion of his Government, the time was approaching when it was possible that the existing Allied Commissions of Control in Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria might be brought to an end, and that for this purpose the League should consider in what way it could effectively carry out the duty of investigation under the above articles.Certain States had made a claim that this question was one which under article 4 of the Covenant specially affected their interests, and that, therefore, they had a right to participate in its discussion as members of the Council. This contention raised a matter of much importance, and it was suggested by the British representative that it should be referred by the Council to a special commission of Jurists, who should be asked to report on the&apos;matter before September. A resolution to this effect was subsequently proposed by the French representative, and unanimously adopted.The British representative further suggested that the permanent military commission which, under article 9 of the Covenant, advises the Council on all military matters should be requested to continue the work begun in 1920 and to prepare for the consideration of the Council a draft scheme for the fulfilment of the duties which would be placed upon the Council when the existing Allied Commissions of Control had been brought to an end.. A resolution to this effect was proposed by the French representative and unanimously adopted.It is expected that the permanent military commission will meet without delay so that its report will be available for the Council at its next Session. It was made clear that the ultimate responsibility rests upon the Council, who in obtaining advice of the jurists and the permanent military commission cannot in any -way delegate their responsibility.
VI. SLAVERY.At its meeting in March the Council had instructed the Secretary-General to prepare a list of experts whom it could appoint a? a special committee to carry out the enquiry, proposed by the Third and Fourth Assemblies, into the question of slavery. At its present meeting the Council appointed, on the suggestion of the Secretary-General, the following persons : M. de La Fosse (France).M. Freire d&apos;Andrade (Portugal).M. Gohr (Belgium).Sir Frederick Lugard (Great Britain).M. van Rees (Netherlands).,M. le Commandant Roncagli (Italy).M. Louis Dantes Bellegarde (Haiti).Mr. H. A. Grimshaw (representing the International Labour Organisation).In view of the importance which the British Government attached to the successful accomplishment of its task by the committee, it was a satisfaction to the British representative to give his support to the nomination of M. Bellegarde, a most distinguished representative of the negro races.The Council did not think it necessary to define closely the terms of- reference of the committee, but were content instead to draw its attention to the debates and resolutions of the Third and Fourth Assemblies on the subject.VII.  SOCIAL QUESTIONS.Traffic in Women and Children.The Council received an important report from its standing Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Women and Children, con-cerning the work accomplished by the committee at its Third Session. There was must in this report of great interest, and much that showed that real progress was being made by the committee in the accomplishment of its difficult task. It was, in particular, reported that the Convention on the traffic prepared by the League Conference in 1921 had up to the present time been signed by thirty-three States and ratified by eighteen, and that the special investigation agreed to by the Council some time ago into the question of the traffic had actually been begun under the direction of Colonel Snow of the American Bureau of Social Hygiene. The-Advisory Committee further reported that they had received fourteen replies to a questionnaire addressed to the Governments, on the-subject of State regulation. In this questionnaire the Governments of nations members of the League, which have recently abandoned the system of licensed houses, were invited to explain the reasons which had led them to such a decision in so far as these reasons concern the traffic in women ,and children. States in which the-system of licensed houses still existed were invited to explain the-
relation of the system to the traffic. The replies from the different Governments were of great importance, and demonstrated not only that there was a close connection between State regulation and the traffic in women and children, but also that the system of State regulation has almost universally been found to fail in securing the objects for which it was established. The Council expressed their hope that those Governments which have not yet made known their opinions on the subject would furnish the information asked for, and requested the Advisory Committee to continue its study of the question in the light of any further replies which might be received.Refugees.1. The Council received a report from Dr. Nansen, the High Commissioner of the League for Russian Refugees, in which he gave an encouraging account of the work accomplished in many different countries on behalf of the refugees. The Council also noted Dr. Nansen&apos;s recommendation that the continuance of his work in this connection should now be handed over to the International Labour Organisation. The reasons which Dr. Nansen gave for this proposal were that the work has now ceased to be political, and that it consists very largely in enabling the Russian refugees to find employment in countries where they can be absorbed into the economic life of the community.The Council, while approving the suggestion put forward by Dr. Nansen, recognised that it could only take effect if the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation agreed to accept the duties which Dr. Nansen proposed for them. The Council further indicated that, in their view, it would be necessary that any political questions which might arise should be brought &apos;to the Council itself for consideration.2. It had been agreed in principle at an earlier meeting of the Council that Governments of Members of the League should be invited to grant to Armenian refugees identity certificates of the sort prepared for Russian refugees by the League Conference in 1922. Since the holding of this conference thirty-five Governments, including some States not Members of the League, have actually put into application the system of identity certificates, to the great benefit of the refugees.The Council now agreed that since so many Governments were familiar with the system, it would not be necessary to hold a further conference on the subject of establishing a similar system for Armenian refugees. They therefore agreed to invite the Govern-ments, without further formality, to grant to Armenians who are without a country the facilities which had proved of such great benefit to many Russians.The Greek representative also informed the Council that his Government was ready to pay the expenses of a League office which should organise the evacuation of Armenians from Greece in the way in which the Constantinople office had so successfully organised the evacuation of Russians from that city.  The Council welcomed this
proposal as one which might be of great benefit both to Greece and to the Armenian refugees.VIII.-TECHNICAL ORGANISATIONS.The Council received reports from three committees of its technical organisations the Financial Committee, the Economic Committee and the Health Committee.1. The report of the Financial Committee dealt principally with the important questions which have been considered in Section I above.2. The report of the Economic Committee gave an account of the important progress which the Committee has made towards securing general agreement for international conventions on the subject of the treatment of foreigners and foreign enterprise engaged in industries or commerce in the different countries, and on unfair competition. It also reported that satisfactory co-operation had been established between the Committee of the International Labour Organisation for a general investigation into the causes of unemployment and economic fluctuations; that the protocol on Commercial Arbitration, prepared last year, had been signed up to the present time by seventeen States, and that the convention on Customs Formalities, prepared by the Economic Conference in Geneva in October last, had been signed by twenty-eight States.3. The Health Committee reported that the majority of Govern-ments in the Far East had expressed a preference for Singapore as the most suitable place for the establishment of a League epidemio-logical intelligence and sanitary statistics office. They further reported that the Rockefeller Foundation had very generously pro-promised the funds required for the establishment of this office.The Rockefeller Foundation had also promised an additional sum for the continuation and extension of the international inter-changes of public health personnel. The Council, in accepting these generous offers, expressed their warm gratitudue to the authorities of the Rockefeller Foundation.IX.-COMMITTEE ON INTELLECTUAL CO-OPERATION.The Council reappointed as a member of the Committee on Intellectual Co-operation the distinguished German scientist, Professor Einstein, who some time ago had resigned his membership of the Committee, and who expressed a desire to be reappointed.They also appointed an additional South American member, the well-known intellectual M. Lugones.X. CONCLUSIONS.In conclusion it- should be mentioned that a number of other questions were discussed by the Council without any definite decision being taken. For example, the British representative reported that the draft treaty between the British Government and the Govern-
nient of Irak had been ratified by the Irak Constituent Assembly,, and he therefore expressed the hope that the Council would be able at its next meeting to give definite approval to this Treaty as a substitute for the mandate required for Irak under article 22 of the Covenant.The question of summoning a Naval Conference for the extension of the principles of the Washington Naval Agreement was, in view of the divergencies of view expressed at the preliminary Conference in Borne in February last, referred back to the Assembly with a recommendation that the Assembly should reconsider the scope, of the Conference with a view to its being widened to include other categories of naval forces than those dealt with by the Washington Treaty.The question of the Financial Adviser appointed by the League at the request of the Albanian Government was postponed until the next meeting, in order that the new Albanian Government might have time to consider the matter.The question of the erection of a Conference Hall for the League on the site generously provided by the Swiss Government was discussed, and it was agreed to recommend to the Assembly that an international competition open to architects of the various nations should be held as soon as possible with a view to securing the best possible design for the hall.The British representative called the attention of the Council to the desirability of earlier circulation of documents to be considered by the Council, and suggested various improvements in the general organisation of the business of the League. The Secretary-General undertook to prepare a detailed scheme for the further consideration of the Council.(Signed)     PARMOOR,Foreign Office, June 27, 1924.
