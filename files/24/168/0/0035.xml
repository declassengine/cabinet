active service, and .J.s retired pay should he suspended *Sir Leo Chio.F,za Money and Mr* Brail Eo.vies on the other hand are cf opinion that retired pay is a reward for past services, and thst therefore, on re-employment, a retired officer should continue to receive his retired pay in addition to full pay and other emolument soOn the particular question as to the grievance   of retired Naval and Marine Offloors that they reoeived worse treatment than retired Military Officers, the Committee.is again divided. She Chairman, Sir Cyril Jackson and Lieutenant Rhlnd find that the practice of suspending retired pay or pension during Active Service is reasonable and that in all the circumstanoes the retired Naval and Marine Officers re-employed in the war were adequately remunerated sSir Leo Ohioaza Money and Mro Emil Da vies on the other hand think that, although the case presents many difficulties and. anomalies, the legitimate grievance felt by many of the Naval Officers who were re-employed In the late war can and should&apos; be remediedo      While, therefore,  they adhere to their opipion on the general principle stated above, they recommend that the amount of retired pay of these officers which was suspended while they were re-employed in the War should now bo paid to them less (l) the amount of the 25 per cent bonus which they received while serving and which re-employed Army   Officers did not receive, and also less (2) the amount, if any which they received as pay in respect of the fact that, unlike Army Officers, they usually (but not In all cases) received a step in rank upon retirement and were re-employed and accordingly paid in that advanced rank)In certain cases re-employed Naval Officers actually received more under their Admiralty terms of re-employment than if they had been treated as Army Officers: in such cases the Proposal made is that they should be left as they areo1 The 3 14 4 4
The Admiralty accept the views of the majority of the Committee which confirm what has heen the practice in thepast and I recommend these to the Cabinet for. approval,i(Initialled) C;,Admiralty. 4, 8. 1924.
