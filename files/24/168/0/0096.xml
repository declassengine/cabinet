SECRET.CP. 493 (24).CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON  UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 110.   October 1924.DURING the period of five weeks covered by this Report, the number of persons unemployed has increased by 22,939, or practically 2 per cent of the number registered on the 22nd September. The upward movement of the figures, which was slightly retarded in the middle of September, received a definite check for the first time since the increase commenced in July, but the movement in the reverse direction was quite slight and the net increase during October was greater than during the corresponding period of last year.It will be seen from Part II of the Report that improved conditions are reported in both the cotton industry and the motor trade. At the same time, however, the depression in the coal-mining industry (which caused an increase in the Registers of 15,000 men in Wales), together with further seasonal depression in the boot and shoe and clothing industries, has counterbalanced this improvement. The position in the iron and steel&apos; trade and in the shipbuilding and engineering industries has changed little, but the tendency has been towards further unemployment.A.

II.-POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL MINING.The employment position in this industry declined slightly during the month, although in some centres the effect of the winter demand for house coal began to be felt. A reduction in orders for export caused a sharp decline in employment in Northumberland and Durham, with the result that some collieries closed down and others worked short time. In the Yorkshire coal-field the position remained fairly steady. The demand for export was slow, but sales for domestic use showed an upward tendency. In Lancashire there was on the whole little change, but a number of collieries worked full time and others increased the number of shifts worked. At others, however, a shortage of orders was experienced, due to the decreased consumption of industrial coal, particularly by such industries as the steel smelting trade. Employment in the Midland coal-field was not quite so good, and short time working increased. At Bristol, the partial settlement of the dispute caused the resumption of work at four pits, and at Keynsham employment was good. In the Gloucester area the improvement was not maintained. In Scotland there was still a considerable amount of irregular employment. The consumption of industrial coal was much below normal, especially in the iron and steel trades. There was a slight increase in the exports from Scottish collieries. In Wales the depression still continued, and stoppages of pits and irregular employment were prevalent.IRON AND STEEL.Employment in this industry continued to be bad on the whole. In the Cleveland area only 39 out of 70 furnaces were in blast, and fears are entertained that further plant may become idle. At Sheffield the depression in the open hearth steel industry was still pronounced. Rolling mills, on the other hand, were fairly active producing steel plates for export and armour plates for the two battleships at present under construction. The steel dispute at Sheffield and Rotherham has now been settled and the majority of the men concerned have resumed work. A further decline in employment occurred at Scunthorpe. In the North-Western counties unemployment in this industry increased. In the Midlands little change was reported and unemployment and irregular working continued at most centres. In Scotland no improvement was recorded, and orders were very scarce in spite of a reduction in price of raw material to the extent of 10/- per ton. In the pig-iron industry trade was slack, and only 29 out of a normal number of 85 furnaces were in blast. Steel works in South Wales were fully employed, except at Merthyr, Ebbw Vale and Port Talbot. At Llanelly and Swansea employment was still good, but uncertainty exists owing to indications that the tin-plate trade has reached its highest point of production and may shortly decline. In North Wales employment was poor at Flint, but a slight improvement was reported at Wrexham.TIN-PLATE TRADE.There are indications of a tendency to slackness in this industry, but so far employment has remained good at Llanelly, Morriston (Swansea) and Port Talbot, the principal centres.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Little change is reported in this industry and the position remains one of severe depression. Discharges of men have taken place at a number of the North-East coast shipyards, and Messrs. Smiths&apos; Docks Co. are reported to be closing their docks at South Shields owing to a serious slump in trade, although the firm will continue their branches at North Shields and South Bank. There was an increase in unemployment at Barrow following the completion of work on two large vessels built by Messrs. Vickers, Ltd. The keel of a new cruiser is, however, now being laid. At the Merseyside ship-repairing establishments, the employment position declined. The dispute with ship-repairing firms in the Bristol Channel ports ended on the 20th October and the shipping yards are consequently busier. There has been an improvement at Swansea, but trade was dull at Newport and slack at Port Talbot. Employment was bad at Holy head. The activity on the Clyde slackened as the result of the gradual completion of existing contracts,&apos;and a number of the less skilled men Avere displaced.
ENGINEERING.Motor and Cycle Engineering. The general position in this industry shows some improvement, and increased orders are expected as a result of the motor shows. At Coventry the improvement was considerable, but it was not so marked at Birmingham, although firms at Sparkhill and Selly Oak re-engaged employees. The position was better at Wolverhampton and Redditch, and firms at Nottingham and at Derby were well employed. In London and the South-Eastern Counties the position was quieter, and intermittent working occurred in places. The activity at Oxford (Morris Works) was maintained. In Lancashire manufacturers were busier, and in Scotland there was a slight improvement at Dumfries.General Engineering.-There is little change to report in this industry. In the North-Eastern Counties employment at railway wagon works was slack, but the locomotive works at Darlington gave good employment. Manufacturers of small tools and saws in the Sheffield area remained busy, and some improvement occurred at Elswick, ITebburn and Middlesbrough. Other centres, however, reported a slackening in employment. In Lancashire some improvement took place in the domestic engineering section, but there was less employment in textile engineering, particularly at Accrington. Unemployment in the Midlands was still heavy, but there was, on the whole, a slight improvement. Employment was generally fair at Basford, Chesterfield, Coventry, Leicester and Wednesbury, and an improvement occurred at Birmingham and Stamford (gas and oil engines). In the South Staffordshire area employment was intermittent. In the South-Eastern Counties the general position was better. Improvement was shown at Erith and Deptford, at Watford and in North London. Some slackness was experienced at East London and Bermondsey, and trade was quiet in the Borough area. In the South-Western Counties little change occurred. The building of railway carriages and wagons was still brisk, and more men were taken on by the Great Western Railway Company at Swindon. Trade in Scotland was generally quiet, but there was a slight improve-ment at Dundee. In Wales the position in the coal-fields still affects employment in this industry, and trade in.the majority of places was slack. Swansea, Mbrriston and Newport, however, reported fair employment.TEXTILES.Cotton. There are signs of definite improvement in this industry. The decision to increase the number of working hours per week in the American section of the trade from 26  to 32 has not so far had any marked effect upon the unemployment figures, but considerable under-employment is giving place to full-time working, and in certain places reductions in the Exchange registers are reported. A similar improvement occurred in the Yorkshire cotton towns, and at Todmorden two firms are now working full time after a long period of irregular short-time working. Trade in the Egyptian cotton-spinning section remained steady.Woollens and Worsteds. The position in this industry remained unsettled. Further unemployment and short-time working was reported in the heavy woollen section in Yorkshire. The position in the South-Western Counties generally remained steady, except at Chipping Norton, where irregular short-time working was again started. In Scotland considerable activity prevailed in the tweed branch. Employment was good at Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and full-time working was resumed at Galashiels.  In Wales employment was generally slack.Hosiery. There is little change to report in this industry, and unemployment was still heavy. A slight improvement was shown at Leicester and Basford, and the position at Nottingham has become more satisfactory. In Scotland the position remained fairly good, but the seasonal slackness still continued.Lace. Unemployment continued to be very heavy, and the general outlook is not hopeful. The improvement in the curtain section at Beeston was not maintained, and trade was very depressed at Nottingham.Silk. Unemployment in this industry has increased to an extent greater than that caused by the usual seasonal slackness. Employment in artificial silk manufac-ture, however, was still good.Jute.-Employment was good in this industry at Dundee, and jute weavers were in demand.
Carpets. Employment remained satisfactory at Kidderminster, and a slight improvement was shown at Salisbury. bBUILDING, BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.The activity in this industry was maintained, and employment continued to be good. Skilled operatives, particularly bricklayers, plasterers, joiners and masons were in constant demand, but a large number of unskilled workers remained unemployed. The usual seasonal slackness existed in painting and decorating work. In the brick and tile industry employment was generally good, but in the South-Eastern area a slight decrease in the output of bricks was reported, consequent upon the closing down of yards which depend on fair weather condi&apos; ions.CLOTHING.The seasonal slackness in this industry still continued, and much short time was being worked except with sections making overcoats. In London, the West End dressmaking, tailoring, fur and clothing trades were more active, and the improve-ment at Stepney in the wholesale tailoring trade was maintained. Employment in the corset trade was still slack, although a slight improvement took place at Ipswich. In the shirt and collar trade short time was being worked at Barnstaple, and slackness was still experienced at Taunton, but an improvement was shown at Exeter. The general position in the glove trade remained unchanged, but trade was bad at Worcester.BOOT AND SHOE MANUFACTURE.Seasonal slackness still prevails in this industry and unemployment increased in some centres. In the Midlands area the improvement in Northampton was maintained, but at Wellingborough and Kettering unemployment was still heavy. Trade was slack at Leicester and Stafford and short-time working still continued. There was a slight improvement at Derby, but at Burton-bn-Trent and Bromsgrove short time was again worked. Employment was not so good at Norwich, where short time was in operation. There was a falling off in employment at Bristol. The slipper trade at Bacup and Rawtenstall was slack. In Scotland there was a slight improvement at Kilmarnock, but the position was not so good at Maybole and Arbroath.POTTERY.There is little change to report in this industry, although there was a tendency towards improvement. At&apos; Burslem and Stoke-on-Trent there was some improve-ment and unemployment decreased at Longton. Employment was still slack at Hanley. In the stoneware trade at Chesterfield the position was good and porcelain firms at Worcester were also well employed.DOCK TRANSPORT.Employment amongst dock workers showed much: fluctuation, and, on the whole, was moderate. At the North-Eastern ports there was a falling off in colliery timber imports due to the depression in the coal-mining industry. Better conditions were reported from Liverpool, where increased goods traffic provided more employment. The position at Bristol improved slightly, but further discharges at Weyniouth by the Great Western Railway Company (Marine Department) were due to the cessation of the shipping of fruit and vegetable produce from the Channel Isles. In Wales the position fluctuated considerably. There was more activity at Barry, but a falling off in trade occurred at Cardiff Docks and some slackness at Port Talbot and Swansea Docks.
III. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion Authorities concerned. In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land have been agreed with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A number of organisations, having as their object the provision of facilities for the settlement of immigrants in certain of the Dominions, have also been assisted. An extension of this assistance to other organisations is under consideration.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the month of September (with the corresponding figures for September of last year) and for the six months ended the 30th September, 1924 and 1923 respectively, are set out in the following Table : -Monthly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The empire settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.

The Scheme,, however, closed to new applications in December 1922. vjj

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance.

Unemployment Insurance.(Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924. the rates of benefit were raised .

(0.)-Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,323,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund.1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Year.

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and (b) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet Cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.
