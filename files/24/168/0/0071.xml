The two main [revolutionary] terrorist organisations had now been resuscitated, new members hr 7710     100  10.24SJB0RET1CP. 469(24)..Printed for the Cabinet.      october  .1924.
large numbers were recruited, arms and ammunition, partly of a kind which cannot t be obtained in India, and must therefore have been smuggled from abroad, were collected. A new and highly dangerous type of bomb was manufactured. Projects of assassination against certain police officers and other persons were devised, movements of these officers: and their residences were watched, and those who watched, being themselves placed under observation, were traced to places known to be [revolutionary haunts] haunts of the conspirators.4. During the year 1923 a series of outrages was perpetrated including a dacoity with double murder at Kona, near Howrah, and the looting of Ultadingi post office in May, a robbery with murder in July, the Sankaritolla murder and others which I need not specify. In January of the present year Mr. Day was murdered in Calcutta and an attempt was made to murder Mr. Bruce in April, in both cases, it appears, in mistake for a prominent and distinguished police official. In March a bomb factory was discovered, and other activities directed to the manufacture of bombs and illicit collection of arms were detected. It is known that other crimes were planned and that projects of assassination continued and still continue. I say nothing of the other deplorable&apos;events which are now under judicial investigation. Evidence has been placed before me which shows to my satisfaction that the movement is deep-seated and dangerous. It is impossible, for obvious reasons, to divulge much of the information available to Government, but it confirms in every way the view I-have been forced to accept.5. Though the situation during 1923 was grave, I was reluctant to invoke the powers conferred upon me by the Government of India Act until I was fully persuaded that all other means for dealing with the emergency had been exhausted. My Government accordingly authorised the confinement, of certain leaders of the [revolutionary movement] criminal associations under the provisions of Regulation 3 of 1818, and the movement was temporarily checked; but new leaders were found and operations were resumed, as is apparent from the. dark record of crime in the present year. I have therefore come to the conclusion, after the fullest consultation with the local Government, that it is necessary to arm the Government of Bengal with special powers,to deal with [violent revolutionary] preparations for crime with the object of protecting, not only officers of the Government whose lives are threatened, but equally private citizens who have frequently been the innocent sufferers from such outrages and misguided youths who are its tools and often thetn-selves its victims. I am convinced that the [movement has assumed dangerous developments against which] preparations and plans for criminal outrages are vow so dangerously developed that it is necessary to provide immediate safeguards by an Ordinance. Permanent measures to remedy the situation will in due course be presented by the local Government.6. The Ordinance is directed solely to these ends, and will in no way touch or affect the interests or liberties of any citizens, whether engaged in private or public affairs, so long as they do not connect themselves with violent [revolutionary crime] criminal methods. The fundamental duty of Government is to preserve the public security on which the political advancement and all the functions of a civilised social organism depend, and, as it is manifest that sound and permanent political progress cannot be accelerated by violence, or threat of violence, so also I deemed it my duty, and the duty of my Government, to see that no violence, or threat of violence, shall operate to retard it. I and my Government will therefore proceed, as [heretofore] we are doing along the lines of political development laid down in the declared policy of Parliament and [in the Government of India Act] reaffirmed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Acting with these objects and these intentions, I believe myself and my Government to be entitled to the support and co-operation of all those who have truly at heart the peace, the prosperity and the political future of India.4.
