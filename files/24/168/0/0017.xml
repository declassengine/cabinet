HIS -QOfifTMBIj^IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITAHIIIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT).ICRET.P.416 (24:OA BIEET,Outstanding Arrangements for Autumn Session.Memorandum by the lord Privy Seal.Before the House of Commons rises for the Summer Reoess there are one or two points on which a decision is required and in regard to which I desire an expression of opinion from my colleagues the first point to which I wish to draw attention is the attitude to be taken up in the Autumn Session to existing Private Members1 Bills,     A large number of such Bills have been introduced during the Session by Members who have been successful in the ballot. Some of these Bills, such as Mr. E.T). Simon1 s Prevention of Evictions Bill and Sir Zingsley Woodrs Summer Time Bill, have been adopted by the Government, the former having already been passed into law.     Mr. Gardners Representation of the People Act (Amendment) Bill has similarly been taken over by&apos;the Government, so far as the provisions regarding equal franchise are concerned, and will be dealt with in the Autumn Session.     At the other end of the scale there are Bills of a politically obnoxious character, such as        / Captain AinsworthTs Trade Union Act 1913 (Amendment) Bill, dealing&apos; with Trade Union political levies which could not in any circum-stances receive the countenance of the Government.     Again, there are Bills which, though praiseworthy In their object, are so badly drafted: and of so contentious a character that it would not in any case be possible for the Government to grant facilities.There are, however, a certain number of Private Members1 Bills which are not open to these objections, and vhich, if Par-liamentary time were unlimited, it would be desirable to see passed  -into lawi     The approach of the Summer Recess is naturally leading the promoters and others interested in these Bills to seek a decision from the Government on their future attitude towards them, as it is clear that unless some special steps are taken, cither by the grant of special facilities or otherwise, few, if any, of these measures will find thoir way to the Statute Book.     In this connection it is worth remarking that the invariable experience of the past has been that only a very small fraction of the Bills so introduced are, in fact, ever passed into law, the remainder dying with the Session.I need not here observe that not only are Autumn Sessions not yet a permanent feature of the Parliamentary programme, but the strongest exception has always been taken to thoir being held except where absolutely necessary to pass urgent Government business., fur experience this Session in dealing with the Opposition Whips has convinced me that we shall have considerable difficulty in obtaining from them the necessary assistance to enable us to pass into law before Christmas even the Bills included in the list which formed Apuendix B to my memorandum of the 14th instant, O.P.397(24), though no&quot; doubt we shall, in addition, be successful in getting through the remaining Stages of a certain number of the Bills included in Appendices C and D,     Por these reasons I am satisfiedth at...
that the strongest exception would ho taken by the loaders of tho Opnosition Parties if the Government were to depart from the long established rule whereby all time in the Autumn Session is taken for Government business, no time being allowed for Private Members, They would certainly claim that the Government had no right to take the exceptional step of summoning an Autumn Session&quot;merely to enable them to allow discussions on Private Members&apos; business; A minority Government is, however,  in an exceptional position, and before reaching a final decision I think it would be a good thing to sound the Opposition Whips in regard to this matter.. Assuming, as I am convinced will be the case, that they share tho view which I have expressed, I suggest that before the Mouse rises a Motion should be put upon the Paper for discussion on its re-assembly, providing, in the customary,manner, for Government business to have precedence for the remainder of the Session and for the adjournment of the House at the conclusion of each sitting on the completion of Government business,     This Motion effectively rules out the consideration of any Private Members1 Bills; but the Government could adopt any measure should they so desire and could moreover &quot;star1 any Bill if they v/cre satisfied by the promoters that by agreement with those members interested in it the subsequent stages could be taken without opposition and without discussion.Tho other point to which I wish to draw attention has reference to the form of the Motion to be moved for the adjournment of the House for the Summer Recess.     Two courses are open, the Government can either move &quot;That this House at its rising this day do adjourn till...&quot; some specified date, or they can adopt the more elaborate procedure which has been followed in recent years whereby provision is made for the immediate summoning of Parliament in the event of emergency.     I,,do not doubt that if the first alternative is adopted the Government will bo severely criticised for making no provision for the possible re-assembly of Parliament &apos; before October, having regard to the European situation, though if the second alternative is accepted there is of course the darager that attempts may be made for partisan reasons prematurely to Turing Parliament together.     The experience of the three years,  1920, 1921, and 1922, when this procedure was adopted, does not, however, lend much support to this argument, as whenever attempts of this character were made tho Speaker declined to take any action without the concurrence of the Government,.     For these reasons, and in view of the, as I think, legitimate criticism with which we should otherwise be faced, I recommend that the second of the two courses indicated above should be adopted by the Government.     In this case also It might, be advisable to consult the Opposition Whips before definite action is taken.(Sgd.&apos;)  J.R. CLYRES,ajing^gtroet.
