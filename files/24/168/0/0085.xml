The Commissioners appointed in 1919 had, as a guide far action, the Report of the Forestry Sub-Committee of the Recon-struction Committee of the Cabinet (Cd.888l), which laid down the following objectives, viz:-(a) To provide an adequate supply of home-grown timberAfforestation Policy.against (i) a possible future war, (il) a probable stringercy in foreign supplies.(b) To increase the amount of permanent employment In rural areas and encourage land settlement in the&apos;
neighbourhood of forests, (c) To provide work in rural areas during periods of unemployment.3. The Reconstruction Committee Report recommended the following programme for planting softwood timber;Total to be afforested in 80 years 1,770,000 acres.Total to be afforested in 1st&quot;40 years 1,180,000   &quot;To be planted in first 10 years:-(l) -Afforestation - Acres.(a) By direct State action ... 150,000(b) By proceeds-sharing       ... 25,000(c) By Municipalities and private individuals ... 55,000   200,000(2) Replanting (municipal and private) ...... ____50,000Total in first 10 years.............   250,000As regards State afforestation the programme (1(a)) we3 to be on expanding lines, the rate of planting beginning with nil In the first (or preparatory :rear) and working up by equal annual increments of 3,300 acres per annum to 30,000 acres in the 10th year.Provision was also made for the acquisition and reconatitu-tion of 20,000 acres of devastated hardwoods.4.     The Act provided for the sum of  3,500,000 to be paid into the Forestry/&quot; Fund during the 10 years immediately succeeding the 1st April, 1919, in such annual amounts as Parliament from time to time determined.     Receipts from, operations were also to be paid into the Fund.Changes in Policy. 5.     The Commissioners proceeded with an expanding planting programme until 1921 when as a result of the Report, of the Committee on National Economy (Qeddes Committee) the programme was limited for the time being to 10,000 acres per annum. 6.     When the late Government came into Office afforestation policy was again reconsidered and the Commissioners submitted in February 1924 a detailed Memorandum on the subject (C.U.646).A Cabinet Committee under the chairmanship of Mr.Snowden rtiet in June 1924 and after reviewing the work of the Forestry Commission up to that -date decided to return to the expanding
planting programme ahO. to link up Forest iVorkers&apos; Holdingswith af forestation .In order to carry this into practice they sanctioned -(l)   A Supplementary Estimate of  275,000.(2)   Acquisition, by le^se and purchase,  of 50,000acres cf plantable land. (3)   The necessary increase rf staff.7.     Ag soon as tho Suppl0m.9nta.ry iistimate was voted byParliament in July 1924, the Forestry Commissioners made thefollowing arrangements:-(a)    To plant 14,200 acres in the year 1924/25 and. toprepare for planting 18,000 acres in 1925/26 and 22,000 acres in 1926/87.lb)   To speed up other work in connection with afforestation-tion such as scrub clearing, preparation of ground, draining, fencing, roads,  etc., the foriaa-tion of new nurseries to meet the plant require-ments for the expanding planting programme.(c)   To begin the systematic establishment of Forest Workers1 Holdings in accordance with a scheme submitted to the Cabinet (Ho. U.P.C.    (24) 17).Summary of work 1919-1924.0.  (a)   Afforestation.    If the Forestry Commission is creditedwith half tho planting results of the 1924/25 planting season,over 100,000 acres will be planted or under immediate promise of planting during the first quinquennial period.   Of thisacreage 45,000 acres will be planted by the State, and 55,000acres by private and corporate effort as the result of grants from the Forestry Fund.   This means that, provided policyis not asrain changed, the 250,000 acre programme of theReconstruction Committee Report should be carried cut in thefirst ten years.    The cost to tho State - apart from ForestWorkers&apos; Holdings which formed no part of the original scheme -should be within the&apos; figure provided for in the Forestry Act,viz:  3,500,000.(b)   Former Crown Woods.   Up to April 1st 1924 the Commissionerprovided the technical management of certain of the CrownI
Woods.   Under the Forestry (Transfer of :^oods) Aot 1923 some   &quot; 120,000 acres including 60,000 of woods have been vested in them.(o)   Unemployment;   Schemes for the relief of   unemployment have been carried out both in the Commissions areas and in the Crown Woods.   Far more effective work could have been done if the Commissioners had been given time for adequate preparation.(d) Surveys. The Commissioners have kept steadily in view the importance of intelligence work as a guide to Policy.:   Great Britain has been spending from  50 - 120 millions ayear in the purchase of forest products from overseas.    Inview of the rapid denudation of virgin forests ail over theworld and the consequent increased dependence on cultivatedforests, an accurate estimate of world, Empire and local timberresources is becoming increasingly important.   The followingsurveys have consequently been put in hand:-(i) World softwood resources. A preliminary report should be ready in three years&apos; time.(ii) Empire timber resources. By co-ordinating the procedure of the various Forest Services considerable progress has been made.   A full report on Empire softwoods should be available by the next Empire Forestry Conference in 1928.(iii) A Survey of, British, woodlands. The existing resources of &quot;British woodlands, area, age classes, species, productivity etc., to be completed in 1925/26.(iv) Area- and Productivity of Afforestalls land, in Greet Britain.    This survey begun in 1919, was interrupted after the Geddos Committee Report and will b6 accelerated as trained staff becomes available.(e) Research. The primary concern of the Commissioners has been to elucidate the numerous problems connected with the large scale establishment of plantations; e.g. the economical production of trees for planting,  the formation and protection of plantations from insect and fungus pests.   They have also devoted considerable attention to the subsequent treatmentof plantations.
On the subject of wood technology and utilisation the Commissioners have co-operated to some extent with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research but progress has been disappointing,     In view of the considerable quantities of timber which the Commissioners now have to market (in consequence of the transfer of the Crown Woods) this is a subject in which they have an increasingly direct interest and it is hoped that greater joint progress may be made,(f) Education..     In addition to assisting the Universities and Agricultural Colleges to provide forestry courses for estate managers, the Commissioners have main-tained Schools for woodmen apprentices, who are required in considerable numbers for the supervision of both State and private forestry operations.     In co-operation with the Colonial Office and the University of Oxford they have . recently established the Imperial Forestry Institute which it is hoped will do much to raise the standardof technical qualifications of forest officers and research workers not only in Great Britain but throughout the Empire,(g) Publications.     Besides their Annual Report the Commissioners have issued a series of Bulletins and Leaflets which incorporate the results of investigation which they have undertaken on some of the more important problems connected with home forestry,(h) Empire forestry.     The Commissioners organised the first Empire Forestry Conference (London, 1920) and co-operated with the Canadian Government, in organising the second Conference (Cansda 1923).     These Conferences have had a very great influence first in placing our great forest resources in proper perspective and secondly In bringing
aoientifio knowledge to bear on the various sylvicultural and economic problems which are pressing for solution.Conclusion.9,     It is submitted that certain fundamental facts have emerged from the comprehensive reviews to which Afforestation Polioy has been submitted in the course of the last few years:(1)   That afforestation is an integral part of soundrural development. (2)   That the materials and means to make a success ofafforestation are at hand. (3)   That stability in Forest Policy is the first essential.Action   Required.10.   (i) the term of office of the Forestry Commissioners expires on November 28th.     It is urgent for the conduct of business that the terms of the Order in Council appointing Commissioners for the 5-year period commencing November 29th be settled forthwith.(ii) The Commissioners are now carrying out the Policy outlined in paragraphs 6 and 7 above.     This policy should be continued and required confirmation.Forestry Commission, 10th November. 1924.
