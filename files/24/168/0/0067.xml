SECRET. 3.P.465.CABINET. 3^Imperial Economic Committee.Memorandum by the President of the Board of ; Trade.I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a report of an Interdepartmental Committee which has been examining various questions connected with the establishment of an Imperial Economic Committee.It will be remembered that the proposed establishment of an Imperial Economic Committee was approved in principle at the meeting of the Cabinet on 30th May (Cab. Concls. 35 (24) (9) (a)).Further, the question of the amendment of the terms ofreference proposed in CP. 323 (24) was left to be settled after the consultation between the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Cab. Concls, 35(24) (9) (b)).   These terras of reference were:-&quot;To oonsider the possibility of improving the methods of preparing for market, and marketing within the United Kingdom, the food products of the oversea parts of the Empire with a view to increasing the consumption of such products in the United Kingdom and promoting the interests both of producers and consumers&quot;.The Interdepartmental Committee, on which the treasury and Colonial Offioe were represented, have not advised anyohange in the terms of reference.I therefore now recommend that these terms of referencebe adopted and steps be taken to secure that when the Committeeis set up in accordance with the Report, their first enquiriesshall relate to meat and fruit and shall be held concurrently.There are also other points in the Memorandum calling for Cabinet deoision vizt-(1) The personnel of the Committee,
(ii) The Chairmanship of the Committee,(iii) The representatives of Great Britain,(iv) Representation of Colonies and Protectorates,(v) Apportionment of Expenses.(Intld.). S.W.6th Ootober, 1924.
REPORT OP INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE. &quot;       .   ^ -.- * fj rJi iJ oThe inter-departmental Oomrnittee have considered various questions connected with the establishment of an Imperial Economic Committee to be constituted on the linea contemplated by the Imperial Eoonomic Conference, 1923, but to be limited in lta terms of referenoe in the first instance to one specific enquiry, i.e.j-&quot;To consider the possibility of improving the methods &quot;of preparing for market and of marketing in the &quot;United Kingdom the food products of the overseas parts &quot;of the Empire, with a view to Inoreaaing the &quot;consumption of such products in the United Kingdom and &quot;promoting the interoats both of producers and &quot;con3umers&quot;.The membership of this Committee would follow that proposed at the Imperial Economic Conference, Lett-Great Britain. *..............   4 memberaThe Dominions................   2 membera eachIndia........................   2 membersColonies and Protectorates..., 2 members The Inter-departmental Committee understand that the Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, Hew Zealand and the Union of South Africa and the Government of India aro willing to participate in the establishment of 3uch a Committee and will appoint representatives.   The Government of Newfoundland have no objection to the proposal but do not at present desire to appoint repreaontatives.   No dociaion has yet been reoeived from the Irish Free State.   Arrangements will be made by the Colonial Office for the appointment of the necessary representatives of the Colonies and Protectorates. TERMS OF RETRENCH.In the telegram sent on the 19th June, 1924, by, the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the parts of theEmpire concerned on tho subject of the appointment of 3uch-3-
a Committee the suggestion was made that the proposed Economic Committee should concentrate their attention first on meat and fruit.   The intor-departmental Committee accordingly recommend that it be an inntruotion to the Committee that their first enquiries shall relate to meat and fruit and be held concurrently. PERSONNEL.With regard to the personnel of the Economic Committee the Inter-departmental Committee recognise that (quite apart from any possible later extension of the Committee^ work) seeing that the various kinds of food products with whioh the Committee will deal, in the oourse of their enquiries, will be very dissimilar, and affecting differing interests it will not be possible for the members of the Oommitteo to be experts fully oognisant with all branches of the subjeots of their enquiries.   This difficulty might be overcome in two way3.   Experts might be appointed to the Committee for a limited portion of the enquiry only (i.e. meat experts to consider the meat question, fruit experts to Consider the fruit question, wheat experts to oonsider the wheat question etc.), or members of the Committee might be chosen on the principle of endeavouring to seoure individuals with as wide a genoral knowledge as possible of the various matters to be considered and the neoessary broadth of outlook to enable thorn to weigh the evidenoe which experts will lay before them. The latter, the Inter-departmental Committee feel, is the preferable method,   The proper place of the expert in such an enquiry is the witness-box.   While, therefore, the Inter-departmental Committee recognise that it must be left to the different parts of the Empire concerned to solve this particular difficulty in the manner which soems best to them, they would reoommend that the attention of tho various Governments should be drawn to tho policy which the home Government propose to adopt, and to,the-very great desirability of the maintenance of continuity in the
personnel of tho proposed Committee In view of (a) the probable extension of their enquiries later to other food products, and (b) the possibility (if their work proves BUooeesful) of entrusting to them other investigations of an economic oharaoter. III. CHAIRMAN.The Inter-departmental Committee recommend that the Chairman of the Economic Committee should be appointed by agreement between the participating Governments, a name being proposed by the Home Government.   It is possible that there may be some risk of overlapping and friction between the proposed Committee and the Imperial Shipping Committee in view of the fact that both are ooncerned, in regard to the proposed enquiry into the marketing of foodstuffs, with sea transport and there may be some possibility of friction between tho Eoonomic Committee and British shipping interests.   The best method of avoiding these dangers would seem to be for both Committoes to have the same Chairman.   The Inter-departmental Committee understand that it was the intention to appoint Sir Halford Maokinder as Chairman of the Committee proposed at the Imperial Economic Conference..  If Sir Halford Maokinder were selected for the Chairman of the new Imperial Eoonomic Committee the neoessary correlation between that Committee and the Imperial Shipping Committee would be eeoured and the oordlal relations which have already been established with British shipping interests would be preserved.   Moreover, Sir Halford Maokinder&apos;s work as Chairman of the Imperial Shipping Committee ia already well-known and appreciated in the Dominions and in India.   Should the Cabinet decide that the name of Sir Halford Maokinder i3 a suitable one to propose to the other parts of the Empire ooncerned, the Inter-departmental Oommittee would suggest that after he has been sounded, the various parts of the Empire participating in the establishment of the Economic Committee should be
formally asked whether they would be willing to agree to his nomination (subject to his acceptance),   in the telegram to the parts of the Empire concerned special attention could be drawn to tho advantage of such an arrangement   from the point of view of co-ordinating the work of the new Committee with that of the Imperial Shipping Committee,   It could further be explained that in the event of the Dominions, etc., agreeing in the appointment of the Chairman suggested the representatives selected by the Home Government would be limited to three.IV. REPRESENTATIVES OP GREAT BRITAIN.The Inter-departmental Committee recommend that the representatives appointed by Great Britain should be as follows s-Sir H. Maokinder (subjeot to his being appointed Chairman) One official (selected by the Board of Trade). Two having practioal business experience (one being a co-operator).V. REPRESENTATIVES OF COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES.In the oaso of the Colonies and Protectorates the Inter-departmental Committee agreed to the proposal of the Colonial Offioe that for the purposes of the first reference to the Committee the two representatives for these parts of the Empire should be as follows:-One Official member.One unofficial member to be appointed from a panel, the member selected from time to time being chosen for the particular enquiry in regard to his knowledge of the part of the Empire concerned in the production of the particular food product, the marketing of whioh the Economic Committee was for the time being investigating.While this differs from the general policy reoommended by the Inter-departmental Committee in Seotion II (above) of this report, the Committee foel that the diverse interests of the Colonies and Protectorates make it unavoidable, and further they would point to the fact that the Imperial Economio Conference itself recognised the neoeasity of suoh an arrangement.
The Colonies and Proteotoraten, it wag agreed, should &quot;be represented by one offioial and one non-official, &quot;who should oharige in accordance with the subjeot under &quot;diaoussion&quot;.   (Report of Imperial Eoonomic Conference, &quot;Page 577 - Omd. 2009).VI. EXPENSES.With regard to the expense   involved in tho establish-ment and working of the Eoonomic Committee, the Inter-departmental Committee assume that eaoh part of the Empire oonoerned would be responsible for the travelling and other personal expenses of its own representatives (those of tho Chairman being paid by the Home Government).The general expenses (other than office aooommodation and secretarial assistance whioh it is suggested should be provided by the Home Government) will presumably be limited to shorthand writers and printing and the travelling expenses of witnesses in this oountry, unless the enquiries of the Committee should involve expensive journeys of any one or more of its members to other parts of the Empire.With regard to these general expenses the best plan   in all the circumstances would seem to be that they should be shared in proportion to membership between the Home Government and the Overseas Governments interested in the partioular enquiry whioh is being undertaken by the Committee.If this scheme is acoopted in principle the Inter-departmental Committee would suggest that it should be pro-posed to the Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Afrioa that thoy should eaoh undertake one sixth of the general expenses of the enquiry on meat and fruit the Home ^Government under-taking one third and also offering to provide office aooommodation and secretarial assistance.It should be mentioned that the Home Government 1b at present responsible for all the expenses of the Imperial Shipping Committee exoept those which involve *enquiry overseas.
