1    * I.r.a.-Rj)OOUMENT is THE PROPERTY OF his BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENT.CABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE (NO.2) BILL. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.iff(24). HOUSE OF LORDS AMENDMENTS.In the Committee Stage on this Bill in the House of Lords on July 28th, three amendments were carried against the Government on vital points(1) The grant of further benefit after exhaustion of benefit due in respect of the individuals contributions was made a matter of discretion instead of being a matter of right (Clause 1(3)).A Conservative amendment to the same effect was fully discussed and defeated in the Commons. (2) The trade dispute disqualification clause (Clause 4) was altered so as to provide that a workman who would be disqualified under the existing law would remain disqualified if he belonged to &quot;a trade union which either by Itself or through another trade union or a federation or association of trade unions is participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute&quot;.    Words to substantially the same effect were moved by Sir John Simon in tho House of Commons but were subsequently withdrawn by him.   The words were then moved by a Conservative Member (Mr.Luke Thompson) and rejected on a Division. (3) The trade dispute disqualification clause was further amended by the omission of the words inserted on the Report Stage in the House of Commons, on the motion of Mr.G.Spencer and others, which provided/that
that workmen should not be unqualified for benefit if they oeaaad work in consequence of a breach by the employer of a district-or-na^onal agreement to whioh he Is a party.As I have stated, the points dealt with by the amendments are of vital importance, and as the Bill must receive Royal Assent not later than Thursday, July 51st, in order to prevent a &quot;gap&quot; in benefits for a large number of people, an immediate decision Is necessary as to the course to be taken.    The Bill is expected to receive a Third Reading in the House of Lords tomorrow.The first amendment making the grant of further benefit discretionary strikes at one of the main principles of the Bill, which was to make all benefit payable as a statutory right, and not as a charitable gift at the discretion of a Minister.   To accept the amendment would mean a danger of the reintroduction of the system of gaps and the refusal of benefits to large numbers of insured persons.The second amendment is one which was specially discussed at a Party meeting when Sir John Simon&apos;s amendment was before the House of Commons, and, as my colleagues will recollect, the strongest objections were voiced to It.    In part these objections were due to a mistaken   idea that the amendment would disqualify for benefit trade union members who, under the existing law, are not disqualified.    This, in fact, could not be the effect.   My colleagues will however, be aware that about 50 per cent   of our own/Party
Party voted against the Clause as it left the House of Commons.    It is impossible to expect them to accept an amendment which makes the Clause even worse than the conservative proposal in the House of Commons.The words deleted by the third amendment were inserted with hardly any discussion on the Report Stage in the Commons/ and, while the principle they embody is an important one, it cannot be urged with regard to this amendment, as it could with regard to the others, that a decision was reached in the Commons after full disoussion.My personal view is that we should ask the Commons to disagree with the first and second of the amendments but to agree with the third rather than lose the Bill.Ministry of Labour. 25th July, 1924.(Intd)   T,S.
