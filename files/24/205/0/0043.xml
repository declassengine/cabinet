HIS DOCUIESHT IS TffE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC I&amp;AJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT. )C A B I N E T. - - - -MOST SECBET. COPY NO..CP. 2^(29).Proposals for a, Subway under Piccadilly connectinK Berkeley Square and the Mailt.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport,Following the decision of the Cabinet   at their meeting on the 26th July, 1929, that no scheme could be approved which would interfere in any way with the amenities of the Green Park, further consideration, as desired, has been given to the question whether any scheme, alternative to those proposed in my memorandum CP.212(29), could be devised complying with this condition.      I am advised, that any tunnel under Piccadilly which would conform with minimum requirements as regards length and gradients must interfere In some degree with the Park and that it is not practicable to devise a scheme which would be entirely free from objection from this point of view.     In these circumstances I&apos; Bcaused the owner of the Lansdowne House site to be informed that I   I was unable to proceed further with the negotiations for safeguarding-the line of the proposed tunnel under his property, and I have also apprised the Westminster City Council, as the local highway authority, of the position.I regret t hat I am unable to put forward any further alternative proposals for securing this traffic improvement.(Intld.)   H.M.1i8th September, 1929.
