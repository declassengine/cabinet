[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.^.1.. .umk.ti(.f..??&apos;&apos;/     -Printed-fort-tke:Cabineti :July 1-929.27SECRET. Copy No.    38CP. 203 (29).CABINET.GERMAN REPARATIONS.General Policy to be Adopted towards the Young Report.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.IT is now apparently agreed that the Reparation Conference to consider the Experts&apos; Report should meet in the first week of August, and it will be necessary, therefore, to decide at an early date what general policy should be adopted towards the financial proposals contained in that Report.2. It is, of course, clear that neither the late Government nor the present Government are in any way committed to the unconditional acceptance of the Report. Mr. Churchill in the answer he gave to Colonel Wedgwood&apos;s question on the 9th May last pointed out that the Committee consisted of independent representatives of the various countries concerned; that the then Government had not at any time sent definite instructions to the British representatives, and that they did not propose to do so; that the Experts must be left to reach their own conclusions; and that &quot;these conclusions, whatever they may be, and whether agreed or not, in no way commit His Majesty&apos;s Government, which remain entirely free to review the whole position and to take their own decisions upon the work and recommendations of the Experts&apos; Committee.&quot;3. There would indeed be little object in convening a financial conference at the present stage if the proposals of the Experts were to be accepted without examination. The right course in that event would be to set up the Organization Committees required to work out the details (e.g., about the International Bank) and to postpone the Conference until those Committees had completed their labours. But. in fact, up to the present none of the creditor Governments have notified the Reparation Commission of their readiness to accept the Report unconditionally and it is practically certain that one or other of the interested Governments will have questions to raise or amendments to propose in regard to every part of the Report, e.q.. M. Poincare has already indicated that he intends to propose limitations on the powers of the International Bank. In short, the position is rightly stated in the last French note in which the French Government agree that &quot; it is indispensable that all the interested States should be called upon to examine the Experts&apos; Report freely before giving their approval,&quot; and &quot; that the representatives of all the Powers interested in the complete and definite settlement of the Reparation problem should be called upon from the start to express their views and to defend their interests.&quot;4. It may, of course, be argued that any attempt on our part to revise the recommendations of the Experts may create political difficulties and delay the evacuation of the Rhineland. This assumes that it will be impossible for us to secure the amendment of the Report in the way we desire without a complete breakdown. I am not at all satisfied, for the reasons which I will set out below, that this is a reasonable hypothesis. But in any case His Majesty&apos;s Government have always [19603]
reserved their freedom of action in regard to thcvRhineland. and if we are unable to secure the agreement of the French and Belgians to an immediate evacuation, I trust that the British Government will not hesitate to withdraw the British troops independently. It seems to me, therefore, that the question of the Rhineland is not relevant to, and should not be introduced into the consideration of the purely financial aspects of the Report which should be dealt with on their merits.5. On this basis, it seems to me that there should be no difficulty in framing the policy which we should adopt to the Report on the following lines : (a.) We should accept the Experts&apos; proposals in regard to the amount of the German Annuities, and the method and conditions of payment;(6.) We should accept in principle the constitution of the International Bank, subject to the introduction of the necessary safeguards;(c.) We can readily agree to the connexion established between debts and reparations; but(d.) We should firmly insist that in the distribution of the German Annuities taken as a whole, the rights of this country under existing agreements are duly respected.6. As regards this last point, my colleagues are aware that the proposals in the Report which are particularly open to criticism are : (i.) That we are asked to accept a reduction, on the average, of  2,400,000 a year of the amount which we would be entitled to receive under the existing inter-Allied agreements. The great bulk of our loss (and the American loss) goes to Italy ( 1,800,000), and smaller amounts (about  500,000 each) to France and Belgium.(ii.) That five-sixths of the unconditional Annuity (viz.,  25,000,000 a year out of the  30,000,000 a year which is available for distribution) is given to France, though France is to put up a Guarantee fund which should suffice to cover any loss thereby entailed to the other Powers during a temporary postponement, (iii.) That the system of Deliveries in Kind is to be continued, on a reducing scale, for 10 years, and may be resumed on a larger scale if any transfer difficulties occur.The Report of the Experts does not give any explanation or attempt any justification of the alterations in the present system of distribution which they propose under the first two heads; and it seems to me that on all these points we must make a firm stand.7. During the war we poured out our financial resources unstintingly, to support our Continental Allies, and since the War, so far from getting anything substantial back in return for the enormous sacrifices which we made, we have constantly been asked to serve as the milch-cow for every European need. The percentage of Reparation allotted to us at Spa was, in the opinion of Lord Bradbur)&apos;, substantially below the percentage to which we were entitled on merits; and although the system of German payments has been altered at least four times during the last eight years, no serious attempt has hitherto been made by our Allies to cut down that percentage. When the late Chancellor of the Exchequer saw M. Poincare last October, he raised the question of the Spa percentages, and M. Poincare acquiesced in their maintenance.*    The proposal in the Report,* Mr. Churchill&apos;s record of the interview states : &quot; I pointed out that in any mobilisation of German capital as a part of, or supplement to, German reparation annuities, we should expect that the Spa percentages would rule and that France would not have any priority of mobilisation in her favour. He made no objection to this.&quot; The note made by M. Camerlynck, the interpreter, fully bears out this record as it quotes Mr. Churchill as saying: &quot; If there should be any mobilisation of the capital debt, it would be clearly understood that the percentages of Spa hitherto followed would be maintained. Opposition would have to be expected if France wished to mobilise capital for her own needs and if she asked for any sort of privilege or priority in this connexion.&quot; Further, the note records that M. Poincare accepted (&quot; prend acte &quot;) this declaration and then suggested that, as the conversations had shown that they were in accord, Mr. Parker Gilbert should be called in. To Mr. Parker Gilbert, M. PoincarS gave a resume of the points on which he and Mr. Churchill were in agreement, one of which was &quot; the maintenance of the Spa percentages.&quot; The formal memorandum setting out the view of the French Government on the Committee stated that &quot; France seeks no fresh advantages,&quot; and that &quot; the French Government took it for-granted that the new settlement cannot in any case modify to their disadvantage the percentages for the -distribution of the German payments as fixed by the agreements at present in force.&quot;
283 Srtherefore, represents;a^new departure in the demands; made-npon this country by our Allies. There might be something to be said for. making a final; sacrifice;now if there were any real prospect that the recommendations in the Report did. represent an absolutely final and definitive settlement of the whole problem; but there can be no, certainty of this, and, in the opinion of many well able to judge the probabilities, the present scheme is not likely to last more than a few years. Even so, a case might perhaps be made for accepting the Plan if the amounts we obtain as debt cover were definitely made a prior charge on the German annuities, so that they could be regarded as reasonably well secured. But, under the Plan, French and Italian reparations are to have priority over the debt payments, and the latter are to be drawn from the postponable annuities. In fact, each of the other Powers obtains some advantage from the Plan France obtains priority for her reparations, Italy an increased percentage of the annuities, Belgium not only an increased percentage, but also substantial payments for marks outside the annuities, while Germany obtains -a reduction in the total payments; but we are asked to take a smaller share of such payments as are received from Germany, and to take them from the unsecured portion of the annuities, and the net result of these sacrifices will simply be that at the next stage of the negotiations we will start so many points lower down the scale.From the point of view of the national finances, the position we have reached is sufficiently serious to make it a matter of serious moment that we should maintain to the full such rights as we still retain.Excluding the very large loans we advanced to the former Russian Government, the total indebtedness to this country of our Allies, at the date of funding, amounted to over  1,200 millions. This debt was raised during the war at an average rate of rather more than 5 per cent., and the interest due upon it accordingly represents a regular annual burden on the British taxpayer of  60 millions. In respect of this debt, our aggregate receipts up to date from all the Allied Governments put together amount to less than  35 millions. On the other hand, the total payments we have made up to date, in respect of our much smaller war debt to the United States Government, amount to over  260 millions, and the steady drain entailed by these large payments to America is becoming an increasing burden on our Exchange and on our economic system. If the French Government now make up their mind to ratify the Debt Agreement, our prospective receipts from Allied War Debts will be about  18 millions a year, as against the  33 millions (rising to  38 millions) which we have to pay to America, and the  60 millions a year which we pay in the form.of interest on the original advances to our Allies. For the balance of our future debt payments to America, we have to look to German Reparations, and if the proposals in the Experts&apos; Report are carried into effect and work successfully, we are to get just the amount required, with our receipts from inter-Allied debts, to cover our future debt payments year by year to America. But, as we are asked to take our share from the conditional Annuity, which the German Government may at any time postpone, we have no very good security for these prospective receipts; and if, in fact, any suspension of payments occurs, we shall immediately be faced with a deficiencjf on our current debt liabilities, as well as having to carry the full burden of the deficiency of over  200 millions already incurred.While we are to be placed in this position, France, who is indebted to us for over  600 millions, is to receive  25 millions a year from the unconditional annuity, as a priority, and a total, on average, of  52J millions a year, so that she will not only be fully covered for her war debts both to this country and to America, but will have a surplus over and above debts amounting at present to some  35 millions a year. -This surplus will be added to the immense foreign Exchange resources which are already at the disposal of the French authorities, and which have been on more than one occasion a menace to the economic situation in this country.&apos; The main benefit of the sacrifices we are asked to make goes, however, not to... France but to Italy. The Italian position was fully set out in the Cabinet Print already circulated (CP. 175 (29)), and I need only say that their present effort to increase their reparation share at our expense can only be described as outrageous. The late Government gave the Italians an unprecedentedly favourable settlement of their debt, involving a reduction of the effective liabilities of Italy from  560 millions to  78 millions, largely on the ground that their reparation receipts would not allow of further payments. The return which Italy makes for our generosity is to demand a further  30 millions of reparations at our expense, thus, in effect, reducing their debt liabilities from  78 to a net  48 millions.8. In view of the above considerations, I, for my part, feel that it is quite impossible to accept the proposals in the Report, involving as they would do  anm
average annual loss of about  2,400,000 and a capital loss of  37,500,000. It is, of course, little enough as compared with our sacrifices, but it represents more than we have as yet succeeded in extracting from all our Allied debtors put together, and it cannot, therefore, be regarded as negligible.I have seen it suggested that if we adopt this course we will precipitate a break-down of the whole settlement, involving grievous financialand political consequences for which the whole responsibility would be placed on our shoulders. No doubt efforts will be made to misrepresent the situation in this way, but it should not be a difficult matter to let the public know the true facts. As explained above, the pro-cedu-re which I contemplate is that we should accept all the recommendations of the Report so far as Germany is concerned, and that we should, if possible, get this part of the settlement adopted in principle before entering on the questions relating to the distribution of the German payments. This is the natural and logical course to follow, the German Government would be a party.to the former discussions, but would not have any reason to participate in Inter-Allied discussions. During these latter discussions we should insist firmly on the m aintenance of the existing Inter-Allied obligations, by which all the other Governments are bound as much as we are. These other Governments appreciate just as much as we do the difficulties that would be created by a breakdown in the negotiations, and the French Government have at least as great an interest as we have in securing a settlement. There is no reason to believe that any of the other Governments could afford to force a breakdown on the question of the Spa percentages, on which we should have no great difficulty in securing the support of other Powers, including Trance. In any case, if a break-down should occur on this issue, the responsibility would clearly not rest on His Majesty&apos;s Government, who would be standing for the maintenance of international obligations, but would rest with those who wished to depart from existing agreements at our expense.9. If the discussions are handled in the way outlined above I see no reason to think that we should be, forced to accept proposals so unfavourable as those put forward in the Report. But we may not find it possible to secure all that we might like and I do not put all the different emendations on the same footing. For my part, I propose that (a) we should insist rigidly on such adjustments of the distribution of the total German Annuities as to give us the full percentage due to us under the existing agreements;(6) we should urge strongly our views on Deliveries in Kind so as to secure their reduction within the narrowest possible limits (so far as Italy is concerned, if we succeed in restoring our Spa percentage it will automatically reduce the amounts which Italy can take in Deliveries in Kind); and in so far as Deliveries in Kind are continued, we should insist that the British Recovery Act should be treated exactly in the same way as Deliveries in Kind;(c) we should press the French in regard to the exorbitant share of the unconditional annuities which they have claimed for themselves, and we should insist, firstly, that they should not convert this priority (as there appears to be some chance they may) into a definite increase of their share in the total German payments, and secondly, that we should get our full, share of any market issue in America, as well as complete control over any issues in London; but provided that we were safeguarded on these points we should not press our objections to the French priority as a sine qua non.I ask my colleagues to agree to my pursuing the financial negotiations involved by the Report in accordance with the foregoing principles.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, July 15, 1929.o
