Copy No.   1 2 cp. 224 (29).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON EGYPT.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the first interim report of the Committee on Egypt; together with the text of the draft Treaty, with a covering memorandum and explanatory notes.It will be seen that the Committee wish to make sure that their colleagues approve in principle (a.) An attempt to conclude a treaty of alliance with Egypt, freely entered into on both sides, on the general lines advocated by Lord Milner in 1920.(&amp;.) The procedure favoured by the Committee, namely, that the draft Treaty should not be signed, but merely initialled, and handed to the Egyptian Prime Minister to take back with him to Egypt, on the understanding that li and when it is accepted by the&quot; Egyptian Parliament, His majesty&apos;s government, for their part, will put it into effect.If the answer to the above questions is in the affirmative, the Committee will proceed to examine the provisions of the draft in detail.A. H.Foreign Office, July 23, 1929,SECRET.FIRST INTERIM REPORT.Before proceeding further With our Inquiry into the details of the proposed new Treaty with Egypt we wish to make sure that we are proceeding on general lines which our colleagues will support. In addition, we wish to obtain an expression of the Cabinets views on an important question of procedure.General Policy.2. We circulate, with this Report, Committee Paper E.C. (29) 1, containing the text of a draft Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, together with draft complementary Notes to &quot;be exchanged on various questions simultaneously with the Treaty, and a commentary by the Foreign Office.[19645a]
3. We have received from the Secretary of State for War Memoranda by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and other members of the Army Council. &apos; The most important question of principle referred to among these documents is one raised by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who adheres to the view of his predecessors that for the defence of the Suez Canal it is essential to maintain a military hold on Cairo as well as the control of the Sweet Water Canal. One of the chief considera-tions on which this view is based is the necessity of ensuring the garrison&apos;s water supply. It must be noted, however, that the Egyptian Prime Minister has stated that he is quite willing to supply condensers in order to make the garrison independent of the Sweet Water Canal, in case of emergency.4. On the other hand, we are assured by the Foreign Office that, unless we agree to the withdrawal of our troops from Cairo and Alexandria and to a concentration of our forces in Egypt in the neighbourhood of the Canal, there is, humanly speaking, no possibility of any settlement being accepted by Egypt. All the information at our disposal supports the Foreign Office view.5. We believe that we shall be acting in accordance with the views of the Cabinet if we proceed on the assumption that the policy of the Government is in future to work on the lines of the Milner Report of 1922, that is to say &quot;A Treaty of Alliance freely entered into on both sides, which, while establishing the independence of Egypt, would give to Great Britain all those safeguards and guarantees which the Protectorate as we&quot;understood it was intended to secure,&quot;and that, in order to obtain a Treaty, it is essential that when alternative accommo-dation has been provided by the Egyptian Government we shall withdraw our troops from Cairo and Alexandria. When the question of principle is settled, we propose to examine the questions of detail raised in the War Office Memoranda.Procedure.6. The other point on which we desire to have the views of our colleagues is a question of procedure, namely, as to whether, on the conclusion of the present negotiations, the draft Treaty should be signed or only initialled.7. The procedure contemplated by Mohammed Pasha Mahmoud is that he welcomes the proposed Treaty whole-heartedly, and that if the present draft is accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government he will restore the Constitution, hold Elections, and lay the Treaty before the Egyptian Parliament for ratification. He anticipates, rightly or wrongly, that the Egyptian Parliament will ratify it, and declares that in any case he would make this Alliance his and his Party&apos;s main plank, and persist with it until it is carried.8. From Mahmoud&apos;s point of view, it would be preferable that he should return to Egypt with a treaty actually signed. In any event, anything in the nature of indefinite promises from His Majesty&apos;s Government would certainly not be enough to enable him to convince the electorate and to cany the country.9. On the other hand, we have received evidence which reveals the presence of considerable doubt as to whether in any event Mahmoud can hope to be successful at an Election. If this information is correct, the present Government in Egypt will never be in a position to deliver and ratify a Treaty by constitutional means. The mere fact that Mahmoud had negotiated a Treaty would, according to this view, ensure its rejection by his immediate successors, who would be bound to demand much stiffer terms.10. We do not consider this an argument for sending Mahmoud away empty-handed. In this connection we are impressed by the following views in the Foreign Office Memorandum of the 15th July : .&quot; In conclusion, it is definitely the view of the Foreign Office that, even if Mahmoud Pasha should fail to secure ratification of this Treaty by the Egyptian
Parliament at the first attempt, His Majesty&apos;s Government have nothing to lose and much to gain by showing themselves ready to implement the Milner proposals. Nothing, in  act, is given away that was not given away when those proposals were published nine years ago, and the fact that an Egyptian offer has been met in the spirit in which it was made, cannot fail in itself to improve the chances of a satisfactory settlement of the problem of Anglo-Egyptian relations.&quot;11.^ The alternative proposal, therefore, is that the Treaty should not be signed, but merely initialled, and that Mahmoud. should be informed, in a covering Note, that if the Treaty is submitted to, and accepted by, an Egyptian Parliament, His Majesty&apos;s Government w^ould proceed to give effect to it. We do not believe that Mahmoud would be satisfied with less than an initialled Treaty. But by the procedure just proposed we should be less formally committed than if the Treaty were signed.12. The difference between signing and initialling is a comparatively narrow one, but we see some advantages from the point of view of the Wafd in our being less formally committed, and, on the whole, we recommend that the Foreign Office should be empowered to ascertain whether Mahmoud would accept the initials instead of the signature of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.13. If the above proposals are adopted, the future procedure would be on the following lines proposed by Mahmoud Pasha, which appear equally convenient from our point of view : Remarks.Stage     I.--Moh&amp;mmed Pasha Mahmoud&apos;s proposals to be reduced to Treaty form.Stage    II, Draft Treaty considered by a Committee of the Cabinet.Stage III. The [draft is subhiitted to the Cabinet, and simul-taneously a summary telegraphed to the Dominions. When the Cabinet have approved the Treaty,Stage IV. It will be initialled in London : the sooner the better, and in any case before Mahmoud Pasha&apos;s return to Egypt at the end of September or the beginning of October next.Stage V. On his return, the Egyptian Prime Minister will at once take steps to explain the Treaty to the Egyptian public at a series of mass meetings, &amp;c. At this juncture the text will be published simul-taneously here and in Egypt. At the same time the suspended Egyptian Constitution will be restored, and elections held as soon as possible.Stage VI. In,November, the newly-elected Egyptian Parliament will be asked to accept the Treaty, as their first business.   If they do so,Stage VII. The approval of Parliament will be sought here for the Treaty.Already done.The first Meeting of the Coni-mittee was held on the 22ndJuly,During Stages I-IV inclusive,the existence and terms of Treaty to remain confidential to pre-vent a campaign of distortion and misrepresentation by the Wafd in Egypt during Mah-moutFs absence.If the Egyptian Chamber fail to ratify the Treaty, the question of its ratification by us will not, of course, arise.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 23, 1929.
E.C. 29 (1).ATTACHED is the text of a draft treaty, and eight pairs of complementary notes, which, in accordance with the instructions of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, have been elaborated by the Foreign Office with the Egyptian Prime Minister and his principal Legal Adviser in the course of the last ten days.The Prime Minister, in the presence of his Minister for Foreign Affairs, has initialled the draft to indicate that they accept its terms.Mohammed Pasha Mahmoud affirms that he welcomes the proposed treaty wholeheartedly, and that, if it is accepted in.turn by His Majesty&apos;s Government, he will restore the Constitution, hold elections and lay the treaty before the Egyptian Parliament for ratification. He anticipates, rightly or wrongly, that Parliament would ratify it, and declares that, in any case, he would make this alliance his, and his party&apos;s, main plank and persist with it until it is carried.In drafting the attached documents, an attempt has been made to liquidate all the Four Reserved Points of 1922 that is to say, to cover all that is essential in Anglo-Egyptian relations. It will be seen that, so far as possible, permanent questions of principle are dealt with in the draft treaty itself, while stipulations of transitory effect or of less importance are confined to the subsidiary notes.The settlement now proposed takes the form of a Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, and is in essentials that recommended by Lord Milner in 1920. A number of points agreed upon between Sir Austen Chamberlain and the late Sarwat Pasha have also been included.In February 1922 His Majesty&apos;s Government terminated their protectorate over Egypt, recognised her as an independent&quot; sovereign State, and thus laid aside any direct responsibility for the conduct of her internal affairs. But the necessity of ensuring the defence of the Suez Canal remained, and still remains. The trend of world opinion generally makes it a matter of increasing urgency that Egypt should voluntarily and formally recognise our right to ensure its-defence.. From our point of view, indeed, all other aspects of Anglo-Egyptian political relations are of subsidiary interest.Lord Milner in 1920 recognised that, while Egypt might formally recognise our right to maintain troops in the neighbourhood of the Suez Canal, she would never admit that the defence of the Canal necessitated the occupation of Cairo and Alexandria by British garrisons. The Foreign Office has consistently held the same view, and, further, has always regarded the apprehensions expressed by the War. Office as to the possible dangers of withdrawal from those towns as unwarranted. The present draft treaty, therefore, provides for the concentration of the British garrison in Egypt in the neighbourhood of the Canal. Unless we agree to this, there is, humanly speaking, no possibility of any settlement being accepted by Egypt.There is another aspect of the strategic issue. Even with a British military force present to defend the Canal, it is evident that we could never admit that Egypt should fall under the domination of another Power who might, for her own purposes, persuade or coerce Egypt into an attitude hostile to us, and so imperil the communi-cations of the Empire. In any event, it is needless to emphasise that we did not withdraw our Protectorate over Egypt, and grant her a large measure of independence, in order to offer, say, France or Italy an opportunity to establish herself in our place. The draft treaty, therefore, lays down that, if Egypt wants foreign advice or assistance, she shall engage British officials except when suitable individuals are not available. In the case of military officers, the employment of nationals of a third Power is excluded altogether.When we withdrew our Protectorate seven years ago, we formally notified all other States that we should regard any interference on their part with Egypt as an act unfriendly to us. Since we could not merely deny to other Powers the right to uphold their own interests vis-a-vis Egypt, without providing some alternative, we4960   [19554]    [19645] b
ourselves, in the Declaration of February 1922, unilaterally assumed the responsibility for the protection of foreign interests. In the attached draft treaty, Egypt takes over this responsibility, and undertakes to us that she will ensure the discharge of her obligations under this head. A failure on her part to do so, would constitute a breach of the treaty, and make it open to us to intervene to put matters right.As to the Sudan, the regime of the Anglo-Egyptian Conventions of 1899 is reaffirmed. All reference to Egyptian participation in the administration is omitted. But, as a face-saving device, and one likely to carry considerable weight with Egyptian public opinion, the return of one Egyptian battalion is provided for (the Egyptian garrison was evacuated from Khartum as a result of the events of 1924). The Governor-General has been consulted and has concurred in this provision. He considers that the concession is justified, if it forms a part of the settlement of the whole Anglo-Egyptian problem. The method by which international conventions shall be made applicable to the Sudan, a question which has in the past given rise to a good deal of friction, is settled by an exchange of notes.The provisions of the draft treaty also include a promise of our support of Egypfs candidature to the League of Nations; a change in the title of His Majesty&apos;s representative from High Commissioner to Ambassador; and a reciprocal undertaking by us to receive an Ambassador here; and, what is perhaps the most important stipulation from the point of view of Egyptian sentiment, an undertaking on our part to-support Egypfs efforts to secure reform in the capitulatory system. It is to be noted that the proposed reform would lie in the direction of a strengthening of the Mixed Courts, a result which would be to our ultimate interest.In Egypt, opposition to the proposed treaty must be reckoned with from the Wafdist party, not on its merits, but because it has not been negotiated by themselves. How strong such opposition might prove to be, it is very difficult to estimate, but, in view of the essentially just and reasonable nature of the settlement provided for, it could be neither sincere nor lasting.Here, the evacuation of Cairo and Alexandria may be viewed with misgiving by the service departments. In considering the question, it is essential to bear in mind (a) that, unless we do evacuate these towns, there is no reasonable prospect of an agreed settlement with Egypt, either now or in the future; and(&amp;) that, with the coming into force of the treaty, the role of the British garrison would no longer, as it is at present, be to provide a sanction available on all issues which we may declare to be covered by the Four Reserved Points, which is to say, all Egyptian affairs of any importance, external or internal. The garrison thenceforth would have one function only, namely, to ensure the defence of the Suez Canal.The garrison would, incidentally, serve, as at present, as a strategic reserve available elsewhere in the Middle East. His Majesty&apos;s Government would retain the right to reinforce it. The Egyptian Prime Minister has agreed that an emergency water supply, from condensers, would be made available against the unlikely contingency of attempts being, made to interfere with the existing supply.As to the nature of the emergency which the British force might be called upon to face, the idea of an overt act of hostility by an Egyptian Government against the British forces Egypt versus the British Empire is in itself ludicrous, apart from the fact that it would be a flagrant breach by Egypt of 1) the proposed Treaty of Alliance itself; 2) the Covenant of the League of Nations; (S) the Kellogg Pact.It is, indeed, hardly credible that any Egyptian Government would place itself in such a position.It might be argued that Egypt might be inclined to throw in her lot with our enemies if she saw us attacked in the Mediterranean by a combination of, say, France and Italy. The temptation to side with our enemies would, undoubtedly exist with things as they are (it existed in 1914, but was not strong enough to affect the attitude of the Egyptian Government), and would make Egypt a source of weakness to us; on the other hand, if she were united to us by a Treaty of Alliance such as that
Foreign Office, July 15, 1929.now proposed, the temptation to side with our enemies would largely disappear, and Egypt, if never likely to be a great source of strength in a crisis, should at least cease actually to weaken us, by compelling us to retain our garrison or even to increase it considerably for repressive purposes.Given the circumstances outlined above, and assuming our continued command of the Mediterranean, all the probability seems to be that the normal role of British troops in Egypt would resolve itself into that of protecting the Canal against possible sabotage by Egyptians. That attempts of this nature should be made is not in itself likely; but it is Conceivable that an Egyptian Government might become so weak, and popular discontent so general, that some form of anarchic movement might develop, in which units of the Egyptian army might become involved. In these conditions, it might be necessary for us to prevent the movement spreading to the towns on the Canal. It is to be noted, however, that His Majesty&apos;s representative at Cairo could hardly fail to be aware, and give warning, of the probability of such developments in ample time to permit of the taking of precautionary measures.Since it is clearly important to us to arrive at an agreed settlement with Egypt, and since there is no prospect of our being able to do so, unless we transfer the British troops from Cairo and Alexandria, the real question to be answered does not appear to be &quot; What is the most convenient strategic position from which to defend the Suez Canal?&quot;but rather  .&quot; Given the situation resulting from the Covenant of the League, the Kellogg Pact and an Anglo-Egyptian alliance, what military and air forces would it normally be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to retain in the neighbourhood of the Suez Canal &quot; (a) with the local object of securing its safety, and&quot; (b) as a strategic reserve for employment in emergency outside Egypt ?&quot;In conclusion, it is definitely the view of the Foreign Office that even if Mahmoud Pasha should fail to secure ratification of this treaty by the Egyptian Parliament at the first attempt, His Majesty&apos;s Government have nothing to lose and much to gain by showing themselves ready to implement the Milner proposals. Nothing, in fact, is given away that was not given away when those proposals were published nine years ago, and the fact that an Egyptian offer has been met in the spirit in which it was made cannot fail in itself to improve the chances of a satisfactory settlement of the problem of Anglo-Egyptian relations.
CONFIDENTIAL.July 15, 1929.DRAFT   ANGLO-EGYPTIAN   TREATY.HIS Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and His Majesty the King of Egypt,Being anxious to consolidate the friendship and perpetuate the relations of good understanding between their respective countries and to co-operate in the execution of their international obligations in preserving the peace of the world,And considering that in order to secure this object it is necessary to settle by mutual agreement the four outstanding questions which formed the subject of reservations in the declaration of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government of the 28th February, 1922,And considering that these objects will best be achieved by the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and alliance, which in their common interest will provide for effective co-operation in preserving peace and ensuring the defence of their respective territories,Have agreed to conclude a treaty for this purpose, and have appointed as their plenipotentiaries: His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond &quot;the Seas, Emperor of India :for Great Britain and Northern Ireland:His Majesty the King of Egypt:who, having communicated their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed as follows : Article 1.The military occupation of Egypt by the forces of His Britannic Majesty is terminated.Article 2.An alliance is established between the High Contracting Parties in consecration of their friendship, their cordial understanding and their good relations.Article 3.Egypt, being anxious to become a member of the League of Nations, will present in the conditions prescribed by article 1 of the Covenant a request for admission to the League, which His Britannic Majesty undertakes to support.Article 4.Should any dispute with a third State produce a situation which involves a risk of a rupture with that State, the High Contracting Parties will concert together with a view to the settlement of the said dispute by peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of any other international obligations which may be applicable to the case.
The four matters &quot;reserved to the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government until such time as it may be possible by free discussion and friendly accommodation on both sides to conclude agreements in regard thereto between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Egypt &quot; were : (a.) The security of the communications of the British Empire in Egypt(cf. article 9 of the treaty and the Army notes); (&amp;.) The defence of Egypt against all foreign aggression or interference, director indirect (cf. articles 7 and 8 of the treaty and Army notes); (c.) The protection of foreign interests in Egypt (cf. article 6 of the treaty andthe Police and Capitulations notes) and the protection of minorities(cf. Minorities notes); (d.) The Sudan (cf. article 13 of the treaty and the Sudan notes).Article 1.This is implicit in the last sentence of article 9 : &quot; The presence of these (British) forces shall not constitute in any manner an occupation and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rights of Egypt.&quot; This sentence was taken direct from the Milner recommendations and also figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft.Article 2.Follows the Milner recommendations and figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft.Article 3.Follows the Milner recommendations. A similar provision in slightly different words figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft.Article 4.Is designed to prevent Egypt, by some act of irresponsible aggression, dragging us into trouble. A more or less analogous provision figures in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft; the present wording is based on that of article 12 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.
Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes not to adopt in foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or will create difficulties for the other Party thereto. In pursuance of this undertaking they will not oppose each other&apos;s policy in foreign countries, nor conclude with a third Power any agreement of a political character which might be prejudicial to the interests of the other Party.Article 6.His Britannic Majesty recognises that the responsibility for the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt devolves henceforth upon the Egyptian Government. His Majesty the King of Egypt will ensure the fulfilment of his obligations in this respect.Article 7.Should, notwithstanding the provisions of article 4, either of the High Con-tracting Parties become engaged in war, the other High Contracting Party will, subject always to the provisions of article 14, immediately come to his aid in the capacity of an ally. In particular, His Majesty the King of Egypt will, in the event of war or menace of war, furnish to His Britannic Majesty on Egyptian territory all the facilities and assistance in-his power, including the use of his ports, aerodromes and means of communication.Article 8.In view of the desirability of identity in training and methods between the Egyptian and British armies, His Majesty the King of Egypt undertakes that, should he deem it necessary to have recourse to foreign military instructors, these shall be chosen from amongst British subjects.Article 9.In order to facilitate and secure to His Britannic Majesty the protection of the Suez Canal as an essential means of communication between the different parts of the British Empire, His Majesty the King of Egypt authorises His Britannic Majesty to maintain upon Egyptian territory in localities to be agreed upon, to the east of longitude 32Q E, such forces as His Britannic Majesty considers necessary for this purpose. The presence of these forces shall not constitute in any manner an occupation and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rights of Egypt.. - Article. 10. ,In view of the friendship between the two countries and of the alliance established by the present treaty, the Egyptian Government when engaging the services of foreign officials will as a rule engage British subjects.Article 11.His Britannic Majesty recognises that the capitulatory regime now existing in Egypt is no longer in accordance with the spirit of the times and with the present state of Egypt.His Britannic Majesty accordingly undertakes to use all his influence with the Powers possessing capitulatory rights in Egypt to obtain, in conditions which will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreigners, the transfer to the Mixed Tribunals of the jurisdiction of the existing Consular Courts, and the application of Egyptian legislation to foreigners.Article 12.In view of the friendship between the High Contracting Parties and of the alliance established by the present treaty, His Britannic Majesty will be represented at the Court of His Majesty the King of Egypt by an Ambassador, duly accredited, and His Majesty the King of Egypt will reserve the highest diplomatic rank at his Court to the representative of His Britannic Majesty.His Majesty the King of Egypt will be represented at the Court of St. James&apos;s by an Ambassador.
Article 6.Egypt takes over the duty of protecting the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt and gives us a binding promise that she will fulfil her obligations. If she fails in her duty we shall have a treaty right to intervene, even if the lives and properties of British subjects are not directly menaced.Article 7.Follows the general lines of the Milner recommendations, but as a result of reciprocity, in the first sentence, Egypt really gives us more than either the Milner recommendations or the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft contemplated. The second sentence follows the latter draft, which, in turn, was based on the Milner recom-mendations.Article 8.A similar provision figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft. It excludes the possibility of foreign influence in the Egyptian armed forces.&apos; Article 9..Longitude 32D E. runs parallel to and about 20 miles west of the Suez Canal, at its nearest point at Ismailia. As explained in the note on article 1, the last sentence figures in both the Milner recommendations and the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft.. Article 10.This is a slightly condensed version of a similar provision in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft. It is designed to prevent the growth of foreign influence in the civil service at our expense.Article 11.A similar undertaking figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft, but the present wording is an improvement, as is the addition of the words underlined. The policy is that advocated in the Milner recommendations.Article 12.A similar provision existed in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft, but it is now made reciprocal to the extent Egypt will be represented here by an Ambassador. This will enable the Egyptian Government to be sure of getting their best men for the post.Our Ambassador in Egypt is assured precedence over all foreign &quot;diplomatic representatives, who will all be of lower rank.In the Milner recommendations and the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft this was a unilateral undertaking on the part of Egypt. Eeciprocity being the underlying idea of the present treaty, the article has been made reciprocal.
Article 14.Nothing in the present treaty is intended to or shall in any way prejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or may devolve, upon either of the High Contracting Parties under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty for the Eenunciation of War signed at Paris on the 27th August, 1928.Article 15.The High Contracting Parties agree that any difference on the subject of the application or the interpretation of the provisions of the present treaty which they are unable to settle by direct negotiation shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations.Article 16.The present treaty shall be ratified and shall come into force on the exchange of ratifications, which shall be effected at as soon as possible.   It shallbe registered at the League of Nations in accordance with the Covenant of the League. At any time after the expiration of a period of twenty-five years from the coming1 into force of the treaty, such modification of its terms as may be deemed appropriate in the circumstances as they then exist may be made by agreement between the High Contracting Parties.In faith whereof, &amp;c.While reserving liberty to conclude new conventions in future modifying the conventions of 1899, the High Contracting Parties agree that the status of the Sudan shall be that resulting from the said conventions. Accordingly, the Governor-General shall continue to exercise on the joint behalf of the High Contracting Parties the powers conferred upon him by the said conventions, and on the coming into force of the present treaty an Egyptian battalion shall be stationed in the Sudan.
Article 16.The treaty is open to revision by agreement after twenty-five years. This seems a safer arrangement than a non-terminable treaty, which runs the risk of unilateral denunciation and which in any case Mahmoud Pasha would hot accept.This confirms the Anglo-Egyptian Convention of 1899, the,most important provisions of which run as follows :-&quot; The supreme military and civil command in the Sudan shall be vested in one officer, termed &apos; the Governor-General of the Sudan.&apos; He shall be appointed by Khedivial decree on the recommendation of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and shall be removed only by Khedivial decree with the consent of His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government.&quot; Laws, as also Orders and regulations, with the full force of law for the good government of the Sudan .&apos; : . . may from time to time be made, altered or abrogated by proclamation of the Governor-General.&quot;Articles 14 and 15. Similar provisions figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft.
ARMY.British Note.Your Excellency,In the course of our discussions upon the text of the treaty which we have to-day signed, certain military questions arose and were most carefully considered. These questions fall naturally into two categories : first, those concerning the Egyptian forces which might, in the unhappy event of the circumstances arising contemplated in the first sentence of article 7 of the treaty, be called upon to co-operate actively with allied British forces; and, secondly, questions touching the British forces which, under article 9, will be stationed in the neighbourhood of the Suez Canal for the purpose of ensuring the defence of that vital artery of British imperial communications.As to the first category, your Excellency and I agreed as follows : (1.) Existing arrangements, under which the Inspector-General and his staff exercise certain functions, shall terminate. British personnel shall be withdrawn from the Egyptian forces.(2.) The Egyptian Government, however, desire in accordance with article 8 of the treaty to avail themselves of the advice of a British military mission. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom undertake to furnish such a mission. The Egyptian Government will send the personnel of the Egyptian forces to be trained abroad in Great Britain only. His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, undertake to receive any personnel which the Egyptian Government may send to Great Britain for this purpose.(3.) In the interests of the close co-operation referred to above, the armament and equipment of the Egyptian forces shall not differ in type from those of the British forces. His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to use their good offices to facilitate their supply from Great Britain whenever the Egyptian Government so desire.With regard to the British forces referred to in article 9 of the treaty : (i.) The Egyptian Government will provide, free of cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government, lands and accommodation, in localities to be agreed upon, equivalent to those now occupied by the British forces in Egypt. Upon the completion of this new accommodation, those forces shall be transferred thereto, handing over the lands, barracks, &amp;c, thus vacated to the Egyptian Government.- (ii.) Subject to any modifications which may in the future be made by agreement between the two Governments, the privileges and immunities in jurisdictional and fiscal matters at present enjoyed by the British forces in Egypt will continue.(iii.) Until such time as the two Governments may agree to the contrary, the Egyptian Government will prohibit the passage of aircraft over the territories situated on either side of the Suez Canal and within 20 kilom. of it. This prohibition will not, however, apply to the forces of the two Governments, to services maintained by genuinely Egyptian organisations or to services already established under existing agreements.We also agreed that the Egyptian Government will give all necessary facilities to British Air Force machines on passage to or from the aerodromes placed at the disposal of the British forces in accordance with article 9 of the treaty. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will give appropriate facilities-to Egyptian military aircraft in territory under their control.Egyptian Note.Sir,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of to-day&apos;s date dealing with certain military questions, and to confirm that it accurately represents the agreement at which we have arrived.
11159(1.) The Egyptians do not want British officers to continue to exercise executive command in the Egyptian army. At the present moment the British Inspector-General is virtually Commander-in-chief.(2.) Instead of executive British officers the Egyptian Government would welcome the advice and help of a British military mission, and the more distinguished the general in command the better they would be pleased. The second and third sentences of this paragraph figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft.(3.) This also figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft.(i.) Mahmond Pasha has given Sir R. Lindsay his personal assurance that the word &quot;accommodation&quot; will be generously interpreted on the Egyptian side, and will include the provision of amenities and of an emergency water supply for the troops by means of condensers. The new barracks cannot be ready for at least two or three years.(ii.) A similar provision figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft. Sir R. Lindsay has promised that abuses whereby the Egyptian Customs are defrauded shall be remedied.(iii.) A similar provision, to which the Air Ministry attach importance, figured in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft. In the present treaty, however, the prohibition does not apply to &quot;genuinely Egyptian organisations,&quot; as this would be manifestly unfair and unacceptable to Mahmond Pasha.
ADVISERS.Egyptian Note.Sir,As you are aware, the Egyptian Government have taken in hand an extensive programme of internal reform, and I realise that this task will become even more far-reaching and difficult in view of the important modifications in the capitulatory system contemplated by the treaty which we have to-day signed. I appreciate that, in order to secure the satisfactory completion of this programme of reform the best advice procurable will be required, and I take this opportunity of informing you that it is the intention of the Egyptian Government to maintain, during the period necessary for the completion of the reforms in question, the employment of British subjects in the posts of Financial Adviser to the Egyptian Government and Judicial Adviser to the Ministry of Justice. Future occupants of these posts will be -selected by the Egyptian Government in agreement with His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and will receive their appointments as Egyptian officials from the Egyptian Government.British Note.Your Excellency,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of to-day&apos;s date regarding the posts of the Financial Adviser to the Egyptian Government and the Judicial Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, and note with satisfaction your Excellency&apos;s statement of the intentions of the Egyptian Government.POLICE.Egyptian Note.Sir,I take this opportunity of informing you that the Egyptian Government intend to abolish the European Bureau of the Public Security Department, but, in pursuance of the undertaking contained in article 6 of the treaty which we have to-day signed, the Egyptian Government will retain, for at least five years from the coming into force of the treaty, a certain European element in their city police, which will remain for the sarnie period under the command of British officers.. If at some future date the Egyptian Government should desire to reorganise their police force, I shall be glad to know whether they can rely upon the assistance of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in this task.British Note.Your Excellency,His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom note with satisfaction that in pursuance of the undertaking contained in article 6 of the treaty, the Egyptian Government, after the disappearance of the European Bureau of the Public Security Department will retain, for at least five years from the coming into force of the treaty, a certain European element in their city police, which will remain for the same period under the command of British officers.If at some future date the Egyptian Government should desire to reorganise their police force, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will be happy to lend them the services of individual experts or of a police mission as they have done in the case of other countries similarly desirous of reorganising their police.CAPITULATIONS.British Note.Your Excellency,Article 11 of the treaty which we have to-day signed provides as follows :-&quot;His Britannic Majesty recognises that the capitulatory regime now existing in Egypt is no longer in accordance with the spirit of the times and with the present state of Egypt.
1:3As recommended by Lord Milner, the Financial and Judicial Advisers are retained. No precise time limit is fixed, and if the right men are chosen for the posts they are likely to be retained indefinitely.160The European Bureau, an experiment dating .only from 1922 and of doubtful value, is to go; it is anathema to the Egyptian Government and also, be it said, to the British Commandants of Police. These latter are to remain for at least five years. Mahmond Pasha has given Sir R. Lindsay a personal assurance that the four Englishmen in the European Bureau will be treated generously.This note only differs from the one negotiated with Sarwat in 1927 in minor respects, which are indicated opposite the paragraphs where they occur. In the nature of things there can be no finality about the provisions of this note seeing that Egypt has got to secure the consent of eleven other Powers to the reform of the Capitulations, and the note only indicates the lines on which we propose to help her in the attempt.
CAPITULATIONS.&quot;His Britannic Majesty accordingly undertakes to use all his influence with the Powers possessing capitulatory rights in Egypt to obtain, in conditions which will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreigners, the transfer to the Mixed Tribunals of the jurisdiction of the existing Consular Courts, and the application of Egyptian legislation to foreigners.&quot;It will be useful if I explain to your Excellency the lines on which I think this reform of the capitulatory regime might well proceed, as I shall be prepared to support the efforts of the Egyptian Government to conclude arrangements with the Powers on these lines when the treaty comes into force.It was hoped in 1920, when negotiations were in progress between the British and Egyptian Governments, that arrangements might be made for the closing by foreign Powers of their Consular Courts in Egypt. Draft laws were accordingly prepared in that year extending the existing jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals, and enabling them to exercise all the jurisdiction now exercised by the Consular Courts.I shall be prepared to agree to the utilisation of those draft laws as the basis of the reform of the capitulatory regime if foreign Powers are willing to transfer to the Mixed Tribunals the jurisdiction of their consular courts.On points of detail many changes will no doubt be required. These must be discussed by experts. There, are, however, certain modifications which will, I think, be necessary in any event, and which I desire to take this opportunity of pointing out to your Excellency.It may be difficult for some Powers to agree to the transfer to the Mixed Tribunals of all suits relating to the &quot; statut personnel &quot; of their nationals. Transfer in the case of these questions should be facultative. Jurisdiction in such matters should remain with the consular authorities unless an agreement is made between the Egyptian Government and the foreign Government concerned for its transfer to the Mixed Tribunals. I anticipate agreement that the Mixed Tribunals should exercise jurisdiction in these matters in cases where British subjects are concerned.In the case of pardons or remissions of sentences imposed on foreigners, and also in connexion with the execution of capital sentences imposed on foreigners, the Minister of Justice will consult the Judicial Adviser, so long as that official is retained, before tendering his advice to the King.I recognise that the conditions in which the capitulations are at present applied as regards the power of the Egyptian Government to legislate for or to impose taxation on foreigners are no longer consistent with modern conditions. I should be prepared to agree that in future any assent which is necessary before Egyptian legislation, including fiscal legislation, is applied to foreigners shall be given by the General Assembly of the Mixed Tribunals, except in the case of legislation relating to the constitution or jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals themselves, which should not come into force until it has been approved by the Powers. It should be the duty of the General Assembly of the Mixed Tribunals to satisfy itself that the legislation in question is not inconsistent with the principles generally adopted in modern legislation which is applicable to foreigners, and, with particular relation to legisla-tion of a fiscal character, that it does not inequitably discriminate against foreigners, including foreign companies.An extension of the criminal jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals will necessitate the preparation and promulgation of a new Code of Criminal Procedure. The draft laws prepared in 1920 contain certain provisions of importance on this subject of criminal procedure (articles 10-27 of Law II, draft of the 18th April, 1920), and your Excellency will no doubt agree that the new Criminal Code should not diverge from the principles laid down in these articles.There are certain matters as to which it will be necessary for agreement to be reached between the Egyptian Government and His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, but I do not think it necessary to do more at the momeni than mention these subjects.
-4- A paragraph in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft relating to the trial of Egyptians accused of &quot; political offences against foreigners &quot; by the Mixed Courts is omitted; it was inserted in 1927 at Lord Lloyd&apos;s instance, and Mahmoud Pasha was not prepared even to discuss it. Article 6 of the treaty should enable us to ensure that, in the unhappy event of a recrudescence of political outrages (there have been none for over five years), the perpetrators are properly punished.This paragraph differs slightly from the corresponding one in the Chamberlain-Sarwat draft in that it is left to the General Assembly of the Mixed Courts rather than to the British Ambassador to see that Egyptian fiscal legislation does not discriminate inequitably against foreigners. Mahmoud Pasha was prepared to accept this, and from our point of view it is preferable that the odium of an unpopular decision should be shared amongst the twelve or so Powers represented on the Mixed Courts rather than that it should fall on us alone.
CAPITULATIONS.The first is the definition of the word &apos;&apos; foreigner &quot; for the purposes of the proposed extension of the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals. I understand from your Excellency that the codes now enforced by the Native Courts in Egypt subject to the Native Courts all persons in Egypt other than those who by law, usage or treaty are withdrawn from their jurisdiction. I am content to accept this principle provided that is understood that all foreigners who have enjoyed the benefit of the capitulatory regime in the past will fall under the jurisdiction of the Mixed * Tribunals irrespective of changes of sovereignty effected after the war of 1914-18.The second is the increase in the personnel of the Mixed Tribunals which will be necessitated by the proposed extension of their jurisdiction, and, as part of this question, the new functions of the Procureur General of the Mixed Tribunals and the staff which will be necessary to enable him to discharge those functions satisfactorily. The Judicial Adviser will, so long as that official is retained, be consulted with regard to the appointment of foreign judges in the Mixed Tribunals and of foreign members of the parquet, if any.Egyptian Note..Sir,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of to-day&apos;s date, in which you informed me of the lines upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom consider that the reform of the capitulatory regime might well proceed, and drew my attention to certain particular considerations to which you attach importance.I am happy to state that the particular proposals to which you referred are in accordance with the intentions of the Egyptian Government, who are also in general agreement with His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government as to the lines on which the reform of the capitulatory system should proceed.As regards the definition of the word &quot; foreigner,&quot; I would observe that, while the Egyptian Government would have no objection to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals including foreigners who possessed capitulatory privileges before the war of 1914-18, those foreigners who do not possess and never have possessed those privileges must evidently be subject to the jurisdiction of the Native Courts.FOREIGN OFFICIALS.Egyptian Note.Sir,In the course of our conversations in regard to article 10 of the treaty whifih we have to-day signed, it was understood that His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will not press for an unreasonably narrow interpretation of this article, and that nothing therein contained shall prejudice the freedom of the Egyptian Government to engage non-British foreign officials for posts for which suitable British subjects are not available.British Note.Your Excellency,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of to-day&apos;s date regarding the engagement of foreign officials and to confirm the statement therein recorded of the understanding which we have reached.MINORITIES.British Note.Your Excellency,I wish to place it on record that it was not thought necessary to mention, in tne treaty which we have to-day signed, the question of the protection of minorities, which figured m the declaration of the 28th February, 1922, but that it is recognised tnat this question will m future be the exclusive concern of the Egyptian Grovernment.

A similar assurance was given by Sir A. Chamberlain to Sarwat Pasha regard to the interpretation of the corresponding article in their draft treaty.
lbEgyptian Note.Sir,I have the honour to take note of your communication of to-day&apos;s date respecting minorities in Egypt.SUDAN.British Note.Your Excellency,When discussing article 13 of the treaty which we have to-day signed, we agreed that the question of the indebtedness of the Sudan to Egypt should now be examined with a view to a settlement on fair and equitable lines.We further agreed that a representative of the British Treasury should discuss the question with a representative of the Egyptian Ministry of Finance as soon as the treaty comes into force.Egyptian Note.Sir,In reply to your note of to-day&apos;s date I have the honour to confirm our agreement that the question of the indebtedness of the Sudan to Egypt should now be examined by representatives of the British Treasury and of the Egyptian Ministry of Finance with a view to its settlement on fair and equitable lines.British Note.Your Excellency,At the moment of signing the treaty of to-day&apos;s date it will be convenient to place on record the agreement which we have reached as regards the method by which international conventions are to be made applicable to the Sudan. The conventions which it will be desired to apply to the Sudan will naturally be conventions of a technical or humanitarian character.In cases where such a convention is signed on behalf of both Egypt and Great Britain, and it is desired that the convention should be applied to the Sudan, the British and Egyptian delegates will, at a convenient moment, make a joint declaration, to be duly placed on record, to the effect that their signatures on behalf of Egypt and the United Kingdom respectively are intended, taken together, to cover the Sudan, and (in cases where the convention requires ratification) that, when the ratifications t*f both the King of Egypt and His Britannic Majesty have been deposited, the convention will become applicable to the Sudan in accordance with its terms. If no such declaration is made the convention will not become applicable to the Sudan, unless by the method of- accession, to which reference is made later.In cases where such a declaration has been made, no special mention would be made of the Sudan in the instruments of ratification.In some cases, where the convention provides for subsequent accession, and it may be convenient that the convention should be applied to the Sudan by this method, accesssion would be effected by a joint instrument, signed on behalf of Egypt and Great Britain respectively by two persons duly appointed for the purpose. The method of depositing the instrument of accession would be the subject of agreement in each case between the two Governments. In such cases no question of ratification arises.At international conferences where such conventions are negotiated the Egyptian and British delegates would naturally keep in touch with a view to any action which they may agree to be desirable in the interests of the Sudan.Egyptian Note.Sir,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of to-day&apos;s date regarding the method of application to the Sudan of international conventions which it may be desired should apply to that country. I beg to confirm the statement therein recorded of the understanding which we have reached.
The Sudan owes Egypt at least  E. 5 million. On the other hand, ever since 1924, Egypt has made a contribution of  E. 750,000 per annum to the Sudan. A solution may possibly be found by writing off one against the other. The very successful outcome of similar discussions last winter in regard to Egyptian and British claims and counter-claims is the best justification for the proposed procedure.These notes sef-tle a technical difficulty which has given rise to a certain amount of friction in the past. It will enable international conventions to be made applicable to the Sudan without raising unfortunate political issues.
