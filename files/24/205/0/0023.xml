I THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,CABINET.HOURS OP EMPLOYMENT BILL.secret. L.P.223(29).Note by the Minister,of Labour.COPY HO.T.r.....The following memorandum prepared by the Ministry of Labour indicates the main heads of the proposed Hours of Employment Bill.     There are a number of points upon which there is a difference of opinion, and upon these a decision will be required before the Bill is finally drafted.     Among these points are the five-day week, overtime, inspection, and the position of mines and railways.I ask for a Cabinet committee to be appointed to assist me in the consideration of these questions and In the drafting of the Bill.&quot;     As most of the matters in question Involve legal consideration^ I would suggest that,    if the Cabinet agrees to the appointment of the Committee, the Attorney-General should be a member of it.(Intd)     M. G. B.Ministry of Labour 21st July. 1929.
WASHINGTON HOURS CONVENTION. HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT BILL-m1.   Scope.It is proposed to adopt the definition of industrial undertaking contained in the Washington Convention which Includes Coal Mines and Railways but excludes Agriculture and Commerce.   Whether Coal Mines should be dealt with in this Bill or in a separate Bill will be a matter for o ons id erat i on. 2.   Normal Working H0urs.The Bill will fix normal limits of 8 hours a day and 48 hours a week with power to work up to 9 hours in order to compensate for the weekly holiday or half-holiday. 3.    Shift Working.Provision will be needed for calculating for the hours of shift workers by taking an average over the period of alternating shifts usual in the district concerned.- ?.ntinu.QH.?. Frocesse s .Provision will be needed for an average week of 56 hours in these processes.5.    Other Methods of Distributing; hours.Provision will be needed for agreements between organisations of employers and workers covering the distribution of hours over a longer period than one week to be sanctioned by the Minister, provided that the Minister is satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable to maintain the normal arrangement specified above and that under the agreement the average weekly hours will not exceed 48.
6.     Five-pay Week.It will be necessary to consider whether provision should be made to enable the Minister to sanction agreements for the 48 hours to be worked in five days.     This might be done either by mentioning the five-day week in terms or by a general provision giving the Minister power to sanction agreements involving the working of more than 9 hours on one or more days of the week.     It may also be for? considera-tion whether the Minister should have power to make an Oder for an arrangement of this kind in the absence of agreement between the parties concerned.Note.   The five-day week of 48 hours is provided for in the London Agreement of 19S6 but not, according to the opinion of the Law Officers under the late Government, in the Convention.     The London Agreement refers specifically to a five-day week or eleven-day fortnight, and a general provision permitting the 48 hours to be distributed over four days or even less would therefore go beyond the term of this Agreement.     The possibility of an Order being made in the absence of agreement between the parties conoerned is not contemplated either by the Convention or by the London Agreement. 7.     Accident etc.Provision will be needed for the normal hours of work to be exceeded in cases of accident, urgent work required on machinery or plant, or force majeux-e. 8*     Overt, j me.Provision will be needed for the authorisation of permanent exceptions for preparatory or complementary work and for temporary exceptions to enable cases of pressure of work to be dealt with.     All extra hours worked under/this
-    151this authorisation -rill bo entitled to payment at time and a quarter except where upstanding wages are payable by agreement between organisations of employers and workers. It is for consideration whether the Minister should be obliged to fix the minimum amount of overtime permissible by regulation as appears to be required by the Convention, or whether it should normally be left to each industry to regulate this mattor for1 itself,  power being retained to enable the Minister to fix the maximum in any given instance on application by any interested association of employers or -workers and after consultation with the industrial Court.Note: The Convention allows a permanent exception to be made for workers whose work is essentially intermittent. The definition of working hours, however, which it is proposed to insert, and which will be found below, renders a provision of this kind unnecessary,  if not meaningless. The Convention only allows temporary exceptions to enable exceptional cases of pressure of work to be dealt with. It will be, however, for consideration whether If the Bill provides only for &quot;exceptional&quot;  cases this would permit the working of ordinary commercial overtime.Under the London Agreement it was agreed that only the temporary exceptions were entitled by virtue of the convention to the enhanced overtime rate.       The Convention lays down that regulations made by public authority should determine the permanent and temporary exceptions and that these regulations shall be made only after consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned,  if any, and shall fix the maximum of additional hours in each instance.       It is therefore open to question whether, if this matter was normally left to be regulated by tho industries themselves, the terms of the Convention would be fulfilled.
s 9-.   Enforcement *Provision will be necess-arv tn require employers to notify the hours of work and the Intervals allowed for meals and rest and to keep such other records as may be ^required, and to give to any worker on request on the occasion of any payment    of wages a record showing the period in respect of which the payment Is made and- the number of hours worked on each day during trhfft period,     In the 1924 Bill no provision was made for a definite system of State inspection.     It will be for consideration whether the same line should be adopted on the present occasion or whether a system of direct enforcement of a greater or   less extent should be included. 10.   Determination of Questions.Machinery will be necessary for the determination of questions arising as to scope, etc., Penalties and Proceedings *The usual pru/isIons will be needed in this respect including a provision permitting - In England, at any rate-an official of an employers&apos; or workers&apos; organisation to undertake the conduct of proceedings before a Court of summary jurisdiction. 12.   Applicationa.It will be necessary to make provision for the exemption of family businesses^ persons holding positions of supervision or management or employed in a confidential capacity, seamen and fishermen, agricultural workers, outworkers, persons employed in commerce and the Naval, Mllltery and Air Forces. 13. Suspension.Power will be needed to suspend the Act In/whole
?/hole or In part in the event of war or other emergency endangering the national safety.i4.    Int erpre tat1on.Under this head &quot;working hours&quot; will be defined as &quot;the time during which the persons employed are at the disposal of the employer&quot; and &quot;week&quot; will he defined as the &quot;period between midnight on Saturday ni^ht and midnight on the succeeding Saturday night&quot;.Note; It will be seen that no special provision has been Included above for either mines/or railways.   The positionof mines will have to be considered in relation to the action taken in regard to the Mining Hours Act of 19 26. As regards railways, the existing agreement between the Companies and the railway unions provides for a working week of six days only, and it seems difficult to reconcile the systematic Sunday work provided for under the agreement with the provisions of the convention for temporary exceptions.
