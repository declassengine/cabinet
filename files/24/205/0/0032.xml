CABINET.COflTRLBulORY B3SB3IOHS SCHEME PROPOSED AMBKDITO BILL. MEMORANDUM BY THB MINISTRY OF HEALTH.1.     I desire the authority of the Cabinet for the preparation of a Bill to amend the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act 1925 with a view to its Introduction immediately after the recess.2.     The main previsions of the proposed Bill are indicated below..and a memorandum by the Government Actuary containing an estimate of the cost of these proposals la attached.3.     The scheme embodied in the Act of 1925 has been subjected to orltioiam mainly on the following grounds:(a) its failure to provide pensions for the wives between-.1^e;\*^^.CEf&apos;65 and 70 of insured men who *bv reason of having attained the age of 70 before 2nd January 1928 were not themselves entitled to 65 to 70 pensions, which began on that date:(b) the termination, at the end of six months after the youngest child attains 14, of the pension of the &quot;pre-Act widow&quot;, l.e. the pension granted to the widow with young children of a man who having died before the commencement of the Aot had paid no contributions to the scheme.4.     With regard to (a) above, it is proposed in the Bill to provide pensions for this class of wives.     But, with a scheme suoh as that embodied In the Act of 1925, any amendment designed to meet a particular grievance inevitably$&amp;$$j&amp;jmjmm&amp;      mum&amp; MMsms mm^m.QOBY HO,S21-
-:    195creates new difficulties and I am convinced that it would,.....be impossible to restrict the proposed extension to the particular class mentioned.     Certain women who would have been entitled as the wives of insured men on 2nd January, 1928 (when pensions between the ages of 65 and 70 began), have in the interval become widows.     I submit that we cannot deny to such women the benefit we propose to give to the other women whose husbands are still alive.But we are dealing with the wives and widows of, a class of insured men the majority of whom by reason of age paid no contributions to the pensions scheme and it would be impossible to find adequate justification for selecting these women only for speoial treatment.     On the other hand administrative considerations compel some restriction.    If all widows of men in the insurable class - as defined in the National Health Insurance Act - were to be brought in, my Department would be faced with the impossible task of ascertaining the employment record of men who died 40 or 50 years ago, and even 40 years hence claims would be coming in from pre-Act widows as they reached the age of 65.     Again many of the younger widows would remarry and would be provided for on the insurance of their second husbands, while others would establish themselves in insurable employment and so become entitled, in right of their own insurance, to old age pensions when they reached the age of 65.     The hard case is that of the woman who was widowed comparatively late in life and whose prospects whether in the marriage market or in the employment market were on that account of the slightest.     I suggest therefore that the Bill should provide pensions for pre-Act widows of men in the insurable class between the ages of 65 and 70 who were not less than 50 years of age when their husbands died.     It may be urged that such widows should
not be requires to wait until they reach 65 but that a case exists for giving immediate pensions to them.     I am however advised that the financial implications of this course are so serious that it is Impossible to face them and even if the money could be made available, it would bg impossible to defend the retention of the contributory principle for post-Act widows when pensions of such Duration were offered as a free gift to pre-Act widows, I suggest that the change proposed will go far to meet the criticism against the original Act that the provision made for the pre-Aot widow was inadequate.     It must be borne in mind that any benefit given to the pre-Act widow is a benefit provided entirely by the Exchequer and her claim can be justified therefore solely on necessity.   . The Act made provision for the younger widow with children and, as will be seen from paragraph 5 below, it is proposed to extend that provision;    the proposal now made, by taking account of the scarcely less meritorious class, the elderly widow, rounds off the original scheme.     I am, however, bound to point out that this concession, which-will result in the award of pensions to certain pre-Aot widows on a very easy test applied to the occupations of their deceased husbands, will throw into relief the cases - an inconsiderable number, it is true - in which post-Act widows have failed to secure pensions because the full statutory conditions were not satisfied.Reference to the memorandum of the Government Actuary - Item B - will show that this extension will impose a heavy financial liability but I am satisfied that on farmers-ts wa cannot exclude the widows while including the wives and I feel that I am only forestalling parliamentary pressure by providing in the first instance for their inclusion to the
extent above proposed.5.    With regard to (b) in paragraph 3 - the &quot;pre-Act widow&quot; - I am satisfied that it would be quite impossible to &quot;continue the pensions to these widows for life, without at the same time conceding the right to pensions to all existing widows of insured men and this would impose an enormous liability on the finances of the scheme.     If any concession is to be made to the class of pre-Act widows who ware beneficiaries under the original Act, I suggest that her right to pension should be continued until the youngest child attains 18, when normally ha will have ceased to be dependent on his mother.      This proposal does not touch the child&quot;s allowance, which would, as at present, cease on the child attaining the age of 14 or, if he remained at school, 16.6.      The Bill will provide for the repeal of Section 25 of the Act which requires the withholding or reduction of the children&apos;s allowances in cases where compensation under the Workmen^ Compensation Act has been awarded in respect of the death of the father.     The rate of contribution payeble under the Act takes no account of this provision and it has. therefore been difficult to justify the deduction.   Further a somewhat elaborate calculation is involved in every case and the amount of the weekly deduction may have no relation to the weekly amount payable out of the compensation moneys, so that there has been considerable dissatisfaction, as ia,; evidenced by the fact that probably 90 per cent, of the cases affected are the subject of appeal,      Steps will be taken to restore as from the appointed day the allowances at the full rate in all cases where at present they are   *!?-* being withheld or reduced.
7.    Among the statutory conditions is included a condition (the &quot;average tost&quot;) which requires that the contributions for the last thre* years before the death of the husband in the case of olaims for widows pensions and before the 65th birthday in the case of claims for old age pensions should represent on the average not less than a specified number for each of the years in question and I am satisfied that this condition should remain as a normal feature of tho scheme.     Experience has however shown that notwithstanding that weeks of incapacity and weeks of genuine unemployment count for this purpose as weeks for which contributions were paid, a certain number of elderly people cannot surmount this teBt, although there is every indication that they had been regularly engaged in insurable employment over many years until just before the period to which the test is applied.     They may be in poor health but cannot properly be regarded as Incapable of work through illness:    they might welcome work if it were available but make no effort to get it feeling that in view of the state of their health and the surplus of available labour it would be useless for them to try to find work.       Thus they cannot be credited with contributions on account of incapacity or genuine unemployment.     1 submit that there is no justification for the refusal of a pension to a man or to the widow of a man who has had a long record of insurable employment, because late in life that record has not been maintained owing largely to causes quite outside his control, ana the Bill will accordingly provide for the waiving of this average test in the case of an insured person (man or woman) who had been continuously insured for at least ten years on attaining 60.8.     The proposed Bill will contain various minor amendments with among others the following objects:
(a) to extend the time within which diaims to pension cbn bis submitted without penalty in the form of the loss of pension for the period prior to the date of the claim.(b) to abolish the residence teat as a condition of the award of a contributory pension.(o) to extend the right to become voluntary contri-distributors within a prescribed time to certain special classes of persons who were found to have been unintentionally excluded by the terms of the Act.(d) to allow of the payment of a small lump sum to a pensioner who emigrates to one of the Dominions or Colonies and who because of emigration loses his right to continue to receive a pension.(e) to extend the period during whioh insurance remains in force in the case of an insured person who emigrates to the Dominions or Colonies and to ellow him to keep his insurance alive thereafter by becoming a voluntary contributor.(f) to enable provisional payments to be made, pending the completion of enquiries to determine age when primary evidence is not available, to an insured person who is entitled either to sickness benefit or unemployment benefit on the one hand or to an old age pension on the other according as he is found to be under or over the age of 65,(g) to extend to step-parents the right which by the Act is limited to natural parents to receive pensions under the Act although they are in receipt
of pensions from the Ministry of pensions, (h) to amend certain provisions which by a decision of the High Court were found not to oarry out the original intention.     One effect of that deoision is to enable a person to seoure a pension by paying the minimum number of qualifying contributions after reaching pensionable ags although not a single contribution was paid at the proper time, that is, contributions need only be paid after the right to pension has matured and then only *o many contributions as the qualifying conditions require   although these may fell far short of the number of weeks of insurable employment for which contributions were payable.     Power will however be given to pay missing contributions in defined circumstances. 9.    Tho memorandum of the Government Actuary shows that the balfnoe which, if the Act were continued in its present form would stand in the Fund at the end of the first decennial period (which ends on Slst December, 1935) will be entirely absorbed by the proposed concessions.     (The acceptance of any amendments during the passage of the Bill, which would involve further expenditure, would therefore necessitate legislation to provide for an increase in the Exchequer grant or in the rate of contribution or in both, for the balance of the decennial period.10.    It is for consideration whether it would not be politic to omit one or more of the proposed concessions to make possible th6 acceptance of some strongly pressed amendment.     In view of the extension of the class of pre-Act widows who will become beneficiaries under the
proposals in paragraph 4, I would suggest that the proposal to extend the period during which the present beneficiaries in this class remain entitled to pensions might cither be abandoned or modified to the extent of^terminating the right to pension when the youngest child attains 16,     Reference to the memorandum by the Government Actuary will show that the abandonment of this proposal would set free  900,000 in the first year while its modification on the lines indicated above would release  450,000.11.     It is proposed that cie new pensions which the Bill will create should become payrble as from the first week of January, 19550,     This will impose a heavy burden on my staff, for while it is estimated that the number of valid claims will be apordximately 110,000 the actual number of claims involving investigation will be far in excess of this number.     It is therefore of the utmost importance that the Bill should be introduced immediately after the recess, and pressed through ail its stages so that the necessary claim forms, which cannot be issued before the Bill has received the Royal Assent, may be made available at all Boat offices by the end of November.     With this object I have given notice of the title of the Bill so that as soon as the draft bill is approved by the Home Affairs Committee (which I hope will be early in October) the text may be circulated to members before Parliament reassembles and Second Reading may be taken immediately after that date.IB.     The inclusion of the pre-Act widow between 65 &apos; and 70 of a man in the insurable class who Is to receive pension if over 5o at the time of her husband&apos;s death will be the main cause of delay in actual payment of
pensions.     Shore is little doubt that only a minority of these widows will be able to supply the insurance particulars of their deceased husbands and in the majority of oases investigation, often protracted, will be neoessary before it can be determined whether the husband was in the insurable class.     If, however, the claims are made in proper time, title will run from the first week in January and any arrears whioh may be due will be paid as soon as the   title is established.   Some delay in payment has to be accepted, if a concession of this character is made.A.G.23ra July, 1989.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARY.1.   The present position of the Pensions Account.     The balance at the credit of the Treasury   Pensions Account on 31st March, 1929, was  42.8 millions.     This is not a permanent reserve. It arises from the circumstance that contributions began to be paid in   January, 1926, while the payment of pensions to persons aged 65-70 did not begin until January, .1928.     The accumulation of funds has not nearly ceased.     A maximum slightly above the present figure will be reached during 1930. Thereafter the Fund will diminish at an accelerated rate until it Is exhausted.     Without any change in the law regulating the grant of pensions, the Fund will disappear by 1937,, and thereafter the excess of benefits over contributions will have to he provided from the Exchequer.The present Exchequer contribution Is  4 millions a year.       This is payable until 1935-36.     It is estimated that in the following 10 years the charge upon the Exchequer in respect of the commitments under the system as it stands at present will be  13-1 millions a year allowing for the fact that under Section 43 of the Act an additional contribution of Id. a week from the employer and Id. a week from the worker is due to be paid from 1936.     Vfithout this increase of contributions the Exchequer contribution over the 10 years beginning in 1936 would he  19 millions a year.It should he understood that these figures provide for no accumulation of funds.     As indicated above the present accumulation is due to transitory conditions;    the scheme provides for no permanent reserve.     It should also be realised that the charges on the Account are limited to pensions to widows, allowances to orphan children end
pensions to persons between the ages of 65 and 70 with the related expenses of administration.     The charge for pensions at 70 and over is outside the Contributory Scheme and falls entirely upon the Exchequer.     In the present year the cost of pensions over 70 is estimated at  35-g- millions.     The average cost of these pensions over the 10 years 1936 to 1945 -will be  48 millions.The Cost of the Hew Proposals iThe cost of the concessions proposed to be included in the Amending Bill cannot be closely calculated but estimated as nearly as circumstances admit may be stated -at about  3-1 millions in the first full year, details being shown-in the following paragraphs&quot;&apos;.     The estimated total expenditure to 31st March, 1936, (the last day of the first decennial period) is about  19 millions.Since there is a balance in the Fund at the present times as above shown, it is possible to take the view that no immediate addition to the Exchequer grant of  4 millions a year is essential.     But postponement of an appropriate Increase In the Exchequer grant can only be secured at the cost of accelerating the exhaustion of the Fund, thus anticipating the date at which the Exchequer grant will go to the higher level.     It is estimated that if the grant Is kept at the present figure of  4 millions a year, the balance in the Fund on 31st.   March, 1936, will be reduced to less than  1 million.     In the circumstances this is a very narrow margin, and it is evident that any concessions beyond those contemplated would necessitate the Inclusion in the Bill of a power to increase the Exchequer charge of  4 millions a year from any date before 31st March, 1936, at which the Fund became exhausted.The positi on &quot;after 1936 on the assumptions that no Increase wlllbe made in the Exchequer grant up to- 2 -
that year and that the new concessions will he limited to those proposed in the Minister&apos;s memorandum is that the Exchequer charge for the ten years ending on 31sjt March, 1946, will have to he raised from the present  4 millions a year to  17 millions a year.     This figure is dependent on the oondition that the extra contributions from employers and workers from 1936 for which the Act provides will be secured.As the cost to the Exohequer under the present conditions would be  13^- millions a year in the ten years in question,  it follows that the effect of the proposed changes is to increase the State charge over this period by  3-1- millions a year or  35 millions in all.     This sum covers the  19 millions to be expended up to 1935-6 (with allowance for loss of interest) and the further expenditure to be incurred by the operation of the proposals in the ten years ending on 31st March, 1936.
So far as can be ascertained the initial number of pensioners would be from 60,000 to 65,000, and this number would not be substantially reduosd for several years, since the pensioned widows reaching 70 and passing into the olass of old age pensioners would be rsplaced by qualified widows, reaching the age of 65.The oost in 1930-31 is put at about  1^-millions and for the full period from January, 1st 1930, to 31st March, 1936,  at something less&quot; than  9 millions.Extension of &quot;Pre-Act&quot; Widows&apos; pensions till the youngest child attains age 18.The cost in the first full year (1930-31) is  900,000, and in the whole period to 31st March, 1936,  5^- millions.Pension to wife aged 65-70 of insured man who was over. .70 on 2nd&quot; &quot;January, 1928.The estimated number of pensions to be awarded is 24,000 and the cost in the first full year (1930-31) is  550,000.The number of cases will rapidly diminish as the age of 70 is reached and the beneficiaries enter the &quot;over 70&quot; pension class.     The oost for the full period to 31st March, 1936,  is about  2 millions.Pension tc widow aged 65-70, provided she was over 50 years) of age when her husband died, of an insured man. who (1) died before 4th Januaryj 1926,  or (2) was over 70 years of age on 4th January, 1926.
D. Removal of Reduction in Children&apos;s Allowances incases where an Award has &quot;been made under the Workmen&apos;s * Compensation Act,The oost is estimated to &quot;begin at about  LOO,000 a year and to rise to a permanent maximum of about  150,000 a year.     Estimated expenditure to 31st March, 1936, about  800,000.38. Removal of the Test as to Average number ofcontributions in the oase of persons who had been continuously insured fox ten years on reaching age 60.It is understood that at the outset nearly 20,000 pensions might become payable&quot; to persons, including from one to two thousand widows, whose claims have hitherto been rejected, at a cost of about  500,000 a year.     In view of the probable reactions of the provisicns of the National Health Insurance Act, 1928, whioh enable insured persons of advanced age who have suffered heavy unemployment to retain their insurance qualification, it is thought that the cost of this oonoession will gradually diminish, and the total up to 31st March, 1936, is put, somewhat speculatively, at about  3  millions.A0WCW.22/7/29.
