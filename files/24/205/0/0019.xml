(THIS DOOTMBETS IS THE HlOESaTY OP HIS BRITAHHIC MAJESTY*S GOVERHMEHT).CO&amp;SCXMTIOTIS OBJECTORS in the CIVIL SERVICE. MMORANDuTiE by the PIffiSIZffilOT of the BOARD OE EDUCATION.I hare had private letters ahout the present practice under which Conscientious Objectors are excluded from the Civil Service.     As there are an appreciable number of Conscientious Objectors in our Party ranks the question is sure to be raised shortly and I have actually deterred one of our members from putting a Question at once on the matter. There are still cases occasionally occurring in my own Depart-ment where we have been unable to take the most suitable candi-date who offered himself because he had been a Conscientious Objector.    I suggest that the Cabinet ought to make up its mind as to whether it does not think the time has come for removing the embargo on the appointment of Conscientious Objectors which exists at present.    The present practice is governed by a letter from the Civil Service Commission, dated the 11th July, 1922, in which it was indicated that:-&quot;Ho person will be eligible who obtained from any tribunal established under the Military Service Acts, 1916 to 1918, exemption from service in His Majesty&apos;s Eorees under those Acts on the ground of a conscientious objection to the undertaking of military servioe, or, although not so exempted, declined to comply with obliga-tions imposed upon him by those Acts.&quot; This is based on the Report of the select Committee (Ho. 69 of 1922), which reported in April, 1922, among other things, that no applications for entry into the Civil Service sh.sQ.1 be entertained from Conscientious Objectors who, althoughSECRET.CP. 219(29).C A B .1 H E T.
available for service, refused to serve in the Great War. ITo debate appears to have taken place at the time upon the Report of that Committee, which was immediately put into effect.My recollection is that we did discuss this matter in the Cabinet in 1934.   At any rate we decided then to leave it alone, but chiefly on the ground that we might have found ourselves defeated on the subject in the then Parliament and so have only prejudiced the restoration of the civilian rights of the Conscientious Objectors.    That objection does not hold good now, as it is very unlikely that the Liberal Party would raise a united objection to the change.    It is now ten years after the war and I suggest that we decide that the regulation of the Civil Service Commission be rescinded and any other necessary steps be taken in other Departments to render Conscientious Objectors eligible for all appointments.C.T.19th July,  1929.
