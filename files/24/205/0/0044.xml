[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1929.SECEET. Copy No.     36CP. 245 (29).CABINET.THE SINGAPORE BASE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I DESIRE to draw the attention of my colleagues to the Conclusions reached by the Cabinet Committee which has been considering the position at Singapore. These Conclusions were communicated by the Prime Minister to the Committee of Imperial Defence at the 244th Meeting of that body on the 25th July, and amongst them is the following : &quot; (iv.) For at least the next two years an Air Force Squadron drawn from Home Forces will be based at Singapore.&quot;In making this communication to the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Prime Minister stated that these Conclusions were provisional.Until a definite decision has been given by the Cabinet, it is impossible for the Air Ministry to make the requisite provision in next year&apos;s Estimates (1) to complete the equipment of the squadron for overseas, and (2) to undertake any works services which may be necessary.I therefore request that a decision may be taken as a matter of urgency to enable the Air Ministry to start the necessary preparations. Even if the orders are placed forthwith, it will not now be possible to complete arrangements in time for the squadron to be available at Singapore before September 1930 at the very earliest.T.Air Ministry, September 18,1929.[19931]
