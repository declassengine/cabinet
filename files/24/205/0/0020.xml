COPY 170. fjfo_-CABINET.MEW ANGLO-FRENCH SUBMARINE TELEPHONE CABLE.Joint Memorandum by the Treasury and the p931 Of f ice . (Circulated by direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer).A new submarine cable is required to provide for the growth of Anglo-French telephone traffic.    Anglo-Continental cables are jointly owned by the British and Foreign Governments,  and the orders for new cables are placed alternately by the British and Foreign Post Offices, the partner office reimbursing the purchasing office its half share.    The last Anglo-French cable was ordered in 1926 by the British Post Office from a British firm, the French Post Office paying,  in accordance with established practice, half the cost.    On this occasion it is the turn of the French Post Office to order the cable.Besides the submarine section there are connecting land sections at each end between the coast and the terminal repeater stations at Canterbury and Boulogne,  the whole forming to all intents and purposes a single cable, which must be of exactly the same electrical characteristics throughout and must therefore be manufactured by the same contractor.    In the case of the last cable the French land section was ordered from the British firm who supplied the submarine section.The French Post Office have obtained tenders from a German and a British firm.    The quality is in each case satisfactory and for the submarine sections the prices quoted are practically identical;    for the land sections the London price is slightly higher.The expenditure to be borne by Great Britain (excludingcertain subsidiary charges incurred in England) will be -Half share of submarine cable  27,000Land cable  11,000 38,000
ifThe French Post Office propose to place the order with the German firm on the ground that they can thereby absorb pro tanto their share of the German Reparation payments.    There are no grounds upfon which the right of the French Government to place the order for the whole cable and to place it in Germany could be questioned,  so long as efficiency of manufacture ia secured at a satisfactory price.It is proposed that the British share of the expenditure should,  like the French share, be met out of reparations, i.e., that the contractor shall be pa.id in German currency out of the British credit with the A-^ent General for Reparation Payments. The general policy of this country has been to decline to take deliveries in kind (with the exception of certain dyestuffs and timber taken before the Dawes plan) .    We have hitherto succeeded in drawing the whole of the British Empire share of Reparation, mostly through the operation of the Reparation Recovery Act procedure;    and if the Young plan comes into force, we should have no difficulty in continuing to draw our full, share by this means. But so long as transfer protection operates under the Daves plan we cannot  rely with absolute certainty on being able to draw the whole of our share by the existing methods.    If therefore we can absorb a part (probably about  20,000)  in payment for this cable, it is in our interests to do so.    The case is entirely exceptiona.1 since,  for the reasons explained above,  there appears to be no alternative to obtaining the cable from Germany, and if it is not paid for out of Reparation account,  the payment to the German Contractors will have to be rcade in sterling in the usual way. Thus the proposal to take our share of the cable as a Reparation delivery will help  to safeguard our reparation receipts, but will not give just ground for complaint to the British Contractors.reasury Chambers, 20th July,  1929 0
