(29) 2) which sets out the effect on Dockyard labour of the government&apos;s decision, and tho Admiralty proposals for dealing with the problem^     Briefly,  if effect were given to the Government decision as from 20th July, 1929, a reduction of tho Home Dockyards Wages Vote of about  141,000 in ths current financial year would be involved and, assuming that tho normal was tags, is not fillod, about 1,200 men would have to bo discharged unlsfaS special steps are taken.      The figures will bo substantially greater In 1930a3o       The Admiralty propose that 1,200 men should be absorbed in the Dockyards on the reduced wages provision in the following manner but emphasise (the fact) that the men absorbed will not necessarily &quot;be those who would have been employed on the Building Programme^     This applies specially to shipwrights, rivetters3 drillers etc.np0231(29).CAB I IT E ToCOMvlITTEE ON SAB CITS DISCHARGES *33d 0 Iff1 *

(This Document is the Property of. His. Britannic Majesjbyja Government)SECRET. 0 A B I IT E ToLoD.(29) 2.COMMITTEE OJ LABOUR DISCHARGES.Reduction of Naval Shipbuilding Frograimrie,, 1928. Memorandum by thenFirsttLord^of the&apos; Admiralty.Effect on Dockyard Labour0The suspension of all work on the &quot;Surrey&quot; (Portsmouth Yard)j &quot;Northumberland&quot;  (Devonport Yard);  &quot;Maidstone&quot; (Chatham Yard), and the slowing down to the extent of  20,000 of work on other Dockyard Items  (Including the Chatham submarine), all with effect from the 20th of July,  1929,, would involve a reduction of the Home Dockyards Wages Vote of  141.376, for the current year, and an even larger reduction for 1930.If present working conditions continued,  the Admiralty estimate that this would Involve a reduction of 1,470 work people during the financial year, and of these a large number would have to &quot;be discharged Immediately.Assuming that normal wastage would not be filled,  the number to be discharged iffay be taken In round figures as 1,200.Part II of this Memorandum gives certain proposals evolved at the Admiralty for retaining an additional 1,200 men in the Dockyards on the reduced wages provision,,     Briefly, the methods proposed are reductions in the amounts of overtime and payment by results, whereby the remaining xvork and wages would be spread over the present numbers.     The average wage would be reduced from about  3o300 a week to about  3.0.0. a week, but no man would get less than his proper time wages.It Is, however, important to point out that while these proposals will meet the financial difficulty, there will still
&quot;be the problem of fitting the men to the remaining work, and this can only be done by discharges in some trades and entries In others.The work to be cancelled Is New Construction, employing trades In certain proportionss the work remaining is chiefly refit and repair, employing trades in different proportions. Unless the Admiralty are allowed to adjust the numbers of the various trades to the work remaining,  the efficiency of the Yards is bound to suffer, and the programme of ships in hand for refit, repairs or under construction will be affected adversely.Provided that the necessary adjustments are made,  the Admiralty anticipate that, with the co-operation of the men, the changes can be effected without loss of efficiency.The present proposals are designed primarily to meet the problems of 1929.     As clearly indicated, a bigger problem will arise in 1930, and further efforts will have to be made to meet this by an extension of the present proposals or by other means. II. Admiralty Proposals.In my letter of the 11th of July, 1929,  I informed the Prime Minister that the Admiralty wore examining certain points, namely&apos;-( 1)    Overtime.(2)    Payment by Results, l.e. Job Contract, and Piece Y/ork.(3)    Short Time Working.(4)    Superannuation.These have now been considered with the following results(1)     Overtime may be divided into two categories (a) Permanent,(b) Temporary and Casual. -(a)    A certain amount of Permanent overtime is essential to the working of the^aras&quot;, but orders have been issued to reduce.lt to a lrJnimum.(b).....
-   fb-L  &apos; Prior to February, 1928s proposals for temporary and Casual overtime had to be submitted for AdmTralty approval.    In February, 1923, power to authorise this overtime wag delegated to the Superintendents of the Dockyardso   The results has been a great increase in this overtime, which for the twelveM.. months ended Irebruary, 1929, amounted to some800,000 man &quot;hours oOrders have been issued to resume control of temporary and casual overtime by the Admiralty, whence it will be restricted to an unavoidable mlninniffio   A reduction is anticipated whereby work and wages will be made available for about one quarter of the total number of men to be absorbed, but not necessarily those who would have been employed on the Building programme.    This reduction of overtime will meet with the concurrence Of the Trades Unions Side of the Industrial (Whit ley) Council for Admiralty Establishment s o(2 ) Payment by Results *A considerable extension of Payment by results in the Dockyards, has been made since the ware   The TradeUnions at first opposed the extension, but afterwards agreedto oo-operate, and the various schemes are now workingsmoothly.The object was to increase economy and efficiency, and the outcome has been beneficial both to the men and to the   management-   As a result, the Dockyards are now able to compete with outside industry on more level terms than formerly for orders for Hew Construction and other Naval re  uir ement s -Payment by Results comprises -(a)   Straight piece works(b J   Job ContractSj in which a gang of men engages -to carry out a piece of work for an agreed sum.The schedules for   piecework end the prices forjob-contracts are fixed at figures designed to enable themen to earn on the average 33*1/3$ above basic time wages,and this is approximately realised in practice.     payment by results Is entirely voluntary, and in all cases time-wages are guaranteed.The /
Tire total wages paid in the Departments concerned in the Home Dockyards last year (1928) amounted to  4,597,322 of which  526,013 was for excess earnings over time wages on payment by re suit s*Out.of a total of 31,100 men employed in a recent week, 18s490, or about 60$, were v/orking on payment by re salt Of these, 6,027, or about l/3rd, were employed on Piecework, and the remaining 123 463, or 2/3rd,s3 were on Job Contracts.^a ) Piecework*     A large proportion of the straight-pxecework&quot; is done on Eew Construction, and it will be automatically reduced by the cancellation of ships now in hand.   The Admiralty do not think it necessary for the present to take any further steps to curtail piecework, nor do they consider it expedient to do so? having regard to the effect on output of daywork, and&apos; of the existing practice in other building yardso) Job Contracts are most frequent in the Repair and reconstruction side of the Dockyard Programmes, and as indicated 3hove, these contracts amount to about 2/3rds of the total work dene on payment by results,  whether  measured in terms of men or money *Existing Contracts must be allowed to stand, but the Admiralty are prepared to take steps to reduce considerably the scope of the system, and to cause the work to be performed instead by time-work. By this means the Admiralty anticipate that work and wages would become available for the remaining 3/4 of the lp&apos;200 men to be provided for;   but, again, not necessarily for those who, would have been employed on the Building Programme *Action has already been taken for the restric-tion of overtime, but, having regard to the previous negotiations with the Trade Unions for &quot; the extension of the system,&apos; it is most important that nothing should be done to restrict payment by results until the Trade Unions have been consulted.   The intention is to get in&apos;touch with them immediately the decision is given.(3) Short Time Working.The Admiralty do not consider that this expedientshould be adopted,  so long as the position can be met byother means a     Here again, previous consultation with themen1 s representatives would be necessary.
The general question of Alternative Work in the Dockyards for the men who would he redundant as a result of the decisions on the Building Programme has been under careful consideration at the Admiralty.   The Trade Union side of the Industrial (Whitley) Council have also raised the question and have been invited to put forward any proposals they have in mind.    These are due to he received at an early  date and will he fully discussed with the Ken&apos;s representatives.Consideration is also being given to the possibility of diverting to the Dockyards any further items provided for in Vote 10 (Works) and other Votes, which would otherwise he carried out by private firms.A. V. A.ADMIRALTY. 16th July, 1929.(4) Sipe ran:nua,t ion 3The Regulations provide that work people, whether established or hired, may be compulsorily discharged on reaching the age of 60, with benefits regulated by the Superannuation Acts.   They may be retained year by year up to the ago of.65 if physically fit, but few are so,retained when numbers are being reduced.In 1927 and 1926, when reductions were in progress, Established Ken in the Dockyards, irrespective of age, were given the opportunity of taking their discharge on reduction with pensions and/or gratuities under the Superannuation Acts according to their actual service.   Only 124 availed themselves of the opportunity, and it is not expected that a larger number would accent a similar offer now.   Bat the Admiralty consider that they should have discretionary power to renew the offer.
