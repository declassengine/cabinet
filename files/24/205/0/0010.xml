Copy No.     D 1CP. 210 (29),CABINET.SECOND REPORT OF THE RESEARCH CO-ORDINATION SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE OF CIVIL RESEARCH.Proposals for Action.Covering Note by the President of the Committee of Civil Research.1. IN February 1920, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research set up Co-ordinating Research Boards for work in fields of scientific research which are of interest to the Fighting Services in chemistry, physics and engineering. Three Boards were accordingly established for this purpose. On the same occasion formal recognition was accorded to the co-ordinating function in this field, which was already being exercised by the Radio Research Board of the Department through agreement between Departments concerned.2. On the 18th October, 1928, in accordance with the recommendations contained in the Second Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Estimates (No. 119), that more attention should be given to the co-ordination of Government research with a view to economy and efficiency, the then Prime Minister asked the Committee of Civil Research to report under the following terms of reference :-&apos;&apos; To consider the co-ordination of research work carried on by or under the Government, to report whether any further measures should be taken to prevent overlapping, to increase economy and efficiency, and to promote the application of the results obtained.&quot; [19611]
3. The Committee of Civil Research thereupon appointed a Research Co-ordination Sub-Committee, which has presented two Reports. The First Report (C.R. (C) 24), which has been published, is a review of existing Government research organisations; the Second Report (C.R. (H) 64), now presented to the Cabinet, contains the Sub-Committee&apos;s conclusions and recommendations on all the matters referred to them except the organisation of agricultural research (paragraph 5).4. These recommendations have been approved by the Committee of Civil Research and by the Committee of Imperial Defence, with the exception of two, which have been reserved for further consideration, viz., paragraph 43 (g) (the appointment of a scientific adviser at the War Office), and paragraph 43 (Jc) (the concentration of all scientific and investigatory work on wireless for the Fighting Services). The remaining recommendations are concurred in by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on the advice of the Advisory Council of the Department, and by the other Departments concerned.5. The recommendations (a) to (/), (h) to (j) and (I) to (g) (pages 10, 11 and 12 of the Second Report), are therefore submitted for formal Cabinet approval. Recommendations (h) and (i) involve the reversal of the directions given by the Government in 1920 as recorded in paragraph 1 of this memorandum.(Initialled) J. R.

SECONDKEPOBT.-INTRODUCTORY.1. At their meeting held on the 18th October, 1926 (Cabinet 53 (26), Con-elusion 6), the Cabinet took note that, in accordance with the Second Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Estimates (No. 119), recommending that more attention should be given to the co-ordination of Government research with a view to economy and efficiency,-the Prime Minister had decided to ask the Committee of Civil Research to report under the following terms of reference : &quot; To consider the co-ordination of research work carried on by or under the Government, to report whether any further measures should be taken to prevent overlapping, to increase economy and efficiency, and to promote the application of the results obtained.&quot;2. The Prime Minister constituted the following Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research to undertake this enquiry : Under-Secretary   of    State   for   theThe Right Hon. W. G. A. Ormsby-Gore, M.P.   .Major W. E.

A.  F. Hemming, C.B.E., Assistant Secretary to the Committee of Civil Research (Secretary to the Sub-Committee).3. In our First Report (C.R. (C) 24), which we submit with this Report, we have endeavoured to draw a picture of the research organisation of Government in this country as it exists to-day. In the present Report we submit recommendations on various matters in which it seems to us that some modification in existing practice would lead to better co-ordination of the scientific work of Government.4. We set out our recommendations as briefly as possible by reference in each case to the appropriate paragraph in our First Report, avoiding as far as possible the repetition of facts already given.5. We reserve for our Third Report our recommendations in regard to the future organisation of agricultural research and to other changes that may be involved.
Ill,-RELATIONS OF DEPARTMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH WITH SAFETY IN MINES RESEARCH BOARD.6. The Safety in Mines Research Board is administered by the Mines Depart- First Report, fment and financed from the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund. It has duties and responsibilities 7o.ras&quot;2S f which border on those of the Fuel Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. To a small extent the duties of these Boards overlap, especially in connection with engineering researches. General co-ordination is effected by the appointment of the Director of Fuel Research of the Department as an assessor of the Safety in Mines Research Board, and by the appointment of the Director of Research of the Safety in Mines Research Board as a member of the Fuel Research Board. These arrangements are adequate for the purpose of co-ordinating fuel research for which the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research is responsible. We recommend that steps should be taken by the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to ensure periodical review of the work being done both by these bodies and by the Universities in the same field.III.-POSITION OF SCIENTIFIC STAFF IN THE FIGHTINGSERVICES.7. As regards civilian scientific personnel employed by the Admiralty, the First Report, War Office and the Air Ministry, there are a number of problems which, though not Para-107-affecting the co-ordination of research, react on the efficient conduct of that research, and, therefore, call for brief comment. The most serious of these arises from the strict obligations of secrecy necessarily imposed in many cases upon the scientists employed, which preclude them from publishing in the scientific journals advances in knowledge gained through their work. These obligations render it impossible, in most cases, for them to maintain, still more, to enhance, their standing in the scientific world ; moreover, Universities are not as a rule prepared to consider secret theses for the purpose of conferring degrees. Under the present system, there-fore, scientists accepting employment in any of these Departments may have to resign themselves to the prospect of scientific obscurity. It should, in our view, be possible to devise some distinguishing token for scientists of exceptional merit employed in the Fighting Services. We recommend that steps should be taken by the three Departments, as far as possible, to remedy this real disadvantage by joint negotiation with University authorities.IV.-TECHNICAL RECORDS AT THE ADMIRALTY.8. The Records Section at the Admiralty would be of even greater value than First Report, it is if it were able to secure that the Experimental Establishments were supplied \l^B&apos; with the necessary scientific publications. At present copies are circulated by the Records Section, but, however essential these publications may be to their work, the Establishments are not permitted to retain them. This restriction, which impairs the efficiency of their work, is due to financial causes. It could, we are informed, be remedied by a comparatively small annual expenditure, not exceeding  2,000 per annum. We therefore recommend that financial provision should be made for the supply of the necessary scientific publications to all the Experimental Establishments of the Navy.V.-POOLING OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH STAFF AT THE AIRMINISTRY.9.   The Air Ministry has made a beginning in pooling their scientific staff; but ^rst Report, at present it is borne on different establishments.  We recommend that in future its para&quot; lb&apos; scientific research staff should be held to constitute a single pool from which the Director of Scientific Research can draw  for  research requirements in any establishment.[19277] b 2
VI. THE AERONAUTICAL RESEARCH COMMITTEE.Mrst Report, 10. We have described the constitution of the Aeronautical Research Committee para. ii9. &apos; as pureiy scientific and civilian. The non-official members are appointed for three years, and are at present eligible for reappointment with or without an interval between the periods of service. We recommend that the Air Council should consider the adoption for the Aeronautical Research Committee of the rule already in use for the Medical Research Council, and for the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, that there should be an interval before members are eligible for reappointment.VII. RELATION OF THE METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE TOOTHER DEPARTMENTS.11. We do not wish to reopen the question of the wisdom of attachino- the Meteorological Office to the Air Ministry, but its present attachment makes it all the more necessary to ensure that adequate attention is given to the meteorological needs of other Departments. We recommend that the Air Ministry should continue to give full weight to the meteorological needs of other Departments.12. We are informed that the machinery of the Meteorological Office suffices to enable it to perform satisfactorily the duties which it is called upon to discharge. As regards its research activities, it is true that only a small sum is specifically allocated to this head, but we are informed that this item is merely intended to form a contingent provision for research, expenditure on which could not be conveniently charged to any other heading in the Estimates. Up to the present the amount of research work undertaken has not been limited by the amount of money provided, but by the amount of staff available. The staff of the Office was fixed in relation to the work which had to be undertaken, and no special staff was provided for research, except in so far as the routine work of the Observatories is research. The constant increase in duties undertaken by the Office has resulted in the time of the staff being more and more occupied by routine work, and less is available for investigations than was the case five years ago. Constant applications have had to be made for more staff to deal with the ever-increasing demands of aviation, and, therefore, the time has not been auspicious for asking for more staff for purely scientific work. So far the routine research work has not suffered, but special investigations have decreased, and it will be necessary to watch carefully that demands for new services are not met at the cost of scientific work.13. We recommend that steps should be taken by the Air Ministry to ensure that adequate attention is given to the promotion of fundamental scientific work in meteorology.First Report, paras. 122-12aVIII.-PROPOSED APPOINTMENT OF A  SCIENTIFIC ADVISER ATTHE. WAR OFFICE.was^TiH)&apos; 14&apos; When seven years aSQ the Present Co-ordinating Research Boards 114-115, &apos; were appointed, the Department of Scientific Research at the Admiralty 156-167. had only recently been established, and its organisation was only in the earliest stages of development. At the Air Ministry it was not until 1924 that the present Department of Scientific Research was organised under a civilian Director. In the years immediately following the end of the War the Co-ordinating Boards no doubt performed a useful service in facilitating exchange of information and programmes for the Service technical officers. The developments to which we have referred have, however, progressively robbed their meetings of this advantage. Now that research at the Admiralty and the Air Ministry is organised under special Directors who are in close touch with one another in their day-to-day work, it is clearly not necessary to provide special external machinery to enable them to meet.   The creation of these posts has, moreover,
facilitated co-ordination, as it is easier for the two Directors to discuss together lines of contemplated research -with a view to avoiding overlapping than for the Boards to reach conclusions on the same question on the basis merely of a series of titles of researches. Similarly, co-ordination, if it is to be effective, implies the necessity of the co-ordinating authority possessing first-hand knowledge of the various research establishments. Such knowledge cannot readily be obtained by the Boards, the members of which can hardly be expected to devote the time necessary for personal visits to these establishments.15.   As will have been seen from the review of the War Office organisation in KwtBeport, our First Report, the conduct of Army research is not centred in a single Director, hX&quot;&apos;126&quot; but is divided and decentralised according to certain broad classes of work.   The appointment of a civilian Director of Research at the War Office has, however, been canvassed and has, indeed, been the subject of much controversy.16. The War Office with its large and important joint Service Committees and Departments dealing with research such as the Chemical Warfare Committee, the Ordnance Committee and the Research Department, Woolwich, is not in the same position as the Admiralty, nor in the case of the War Office is there any counterpart to the Admiralty Research Laboratory at Teddington, which concerns itself primarily with the investigation of first principles, i.e., with scientific research of a fundamental and pioneer character which may bear on naval interests. It appears probable that the appointment at the War Office of an officer with duties formally comparable to those of the Department of Scientific Research at the Admiralty would not be possible without extensive changes in the research organisa-tion of the War Office. The nature of those changes would require much closer examination than we have been able to devote to them, before it would be possible to form a reasoned opinion on the question whether they could easily be effected or would be in the best interests of the work.17. We consider however that at this stage many advantages, including that of securing to the War Office the means of establishing effective contact with the other Services and with outside research organisations, could be secured by the appointment, for a period of, say, five years in the first instance, of an officer comparable in scientific standing to the Directors of Scientific Research at the Admiralty and the Air Ministry as Scientific Adviser at the War Office. Such an officer would be available for consultation when desired by. any department in the War Office. During the provisional five years&apos; period, experience would be gained to enable the ultimate form of appointment to be determined. We are of opinion that the appointment of such a civilian Scientific Adviser would be of advantage from two points of view; first, externally in connection with better co-ordination with the research activities of other Departments, and secondly, internally in regard to the work of the scientific personnel employed under the War Office.18. As regards co-ordination with the activities of other Departments, we believe that a Scientific Adviser at the War Office would facilitate communications not only with other Service Departments and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, but also with the outside scientific world. In the discussions at the Research Sub-Committee of the Imperial Conference, stress was laid on the importance in the development of inter-Imperial relations in science of appointing &quot; opposite numbers &quot; in the Dominions, who would be able to establish direct personal relations with their &quot; opposite numbers &quot; in Great Britain. We believe this principle applies not only to inter-Imperial relations, but also to inter-Departmental relations at home. The fact that the &quot; opposite number&quot; in the case of the War Office would not have the same functions as his &apos;&apos; opposite number&quot; in the Admiralty or Air Ministry would not vitiate the principle nor would it negative his usefulness. . As principal liaison officer between the scientific work carried on under the War Offi.ce and that carried on by other Departments at home and in the Empire overseas, the Scientific Adviser would be a valuable addition to existing machinery.19. From the point of view of the War Office itself we are of opinion that one of the chief advantages of the appointment of a civilian Scientific Adviser would He in providing the military officers, who have heavy administrative responsibilities, with the necessary information regarding the work of the large staff of scientists employed by the War Office.  Interchange of scientific workers between establishments
and even from problem to problem is often desirable not only in the interests of the work to be done, but in the interests of the research workers. The research mind requires new contacts and variety of stimulus for its development. Without doubt the importance of the best use of scientific personnel and their encouragement is fully appreciated by the officers responsible for research under the War Office, but we are of opinion that their task would be facilitated by a Scientific Adviser continually in touch with the work being done by individuals. And, further, it must always be borne in mind that in the course of work on any particular problem, new avenues of suggestion and discovery may be opened up which in themselves have only minor importance for the solution of the special Service problem of interest to the War Office, but are of greater value either to fundamental science or to. applica-tions in other fields. It would be the duty of the Scientific Adviser to be on the look out for such developments and to communicate the ideas or methods to those most likely to be in a positionto follow them up and make use of them.20. We do not feel qualified to lay down with precision the exact functions of the proposed Scientific Adviser, or the place he should occupy in the organisation of the War Office. If, as we hope, the Army Council approve the appointment of such an officer on an experimental basis, the functions to be assigned to him will naturally be worked out in detail by the responsible heads of the military and civil departments of the War Office. Similarly, the relation in which the Scientific Adviser is to stand to the various departments of the War Office and to its numerous establishments can only be settled by the Army Council after careful consideration by the heads of the Departments concerned.IX.-CO-ORDINATION OF RESEARCH IN THE FIGHTING SERVICES.^Stb.^.66-rt&apos; 21 - The Select Committee on Estimates drew particular attention in their 157. 5.e^or.t to t3ie neec* ^or *urtner co-ordination of the Research Organisations of theFighting Services, and we therefore devote a special section to this subject. The existing system of Co-ordinating Research Boards established by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research is described in our First Report.22.   These Boards have no executive functions, and their  responsibilities as   regards   co-ordination   are,   in   practice,   confined   to  the   interchange of information between the various Government technical establishments.   They have endeavoured to carry out this duty by asking annually for particulars of the research programmes of the Fighting Services and arranging for a general discussion of these programmes at meetings at which technical representatives of the Services are present.   The Service Departments have supplied the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research with a great deal of information to enable this to be done, but, naturally, they have not been able to supply it with much information on secret researches.   Decisive action has seldom, if ever, resulted from the discussions of the Boards.   That the discussion of these common programmes has, however, done some good there is little doubt.   The Boards have rendered a useful service in furnishing an informal meeting-ground for the scientific officers concerned.   Their procedure is, however, laborious, and it appears doubtful to us whether the results secured are really worth the time and labour involved.   The Boards cannot compel any Service Department or any section of any Service Department to stop research on the grounds that some other Department is doing similar work.   All they can do is to draw attention to the possibility of overlapping.   Their position is, moreover, somewhat anomalous, as they possess a certain degree of responsibility, but have no power of enforcing their views against those of the Service Departments.   The grant of such powers would, in effect, involve the transfer of responsibility for the direction of Service research from the military staffs of the three Services to a civilian Department. Such a transfer would involve grave difficulties in regard to the Ministerial responsi-bility of the Service Ministers.  On the uninterrupted development and application of research much of the efficiency of the Fighting Services must necessarily depend, and separation of responsibility for such an essential service would be wholly inconsistent with responsibilities for national defence imposed on the Board of Admiralty and on the Army and Air Councils.  Even if these difficulties could be overcome and we are of opinion that they could not-the transfer of responsibilities for research to a civilian Department would defeat the very ends which it was designed to serve.   A
X.-ECONOMIC RESEARCHES IN THE FIGHTING SERVICES.26    In dealing with the research work of the Fighting Services we were much first Export impressed with the value of the research already undertaken for prolonging the life eara-  -of otherwise satisfactory materiel and we were informed that considerable savings had been achieved.   We recommend that this class of work should be developed by the three Service Departments as opportunity offers.research organisation can only be expected to be effective in so far as it is closely associated with the practical needs of the Service for which it is working. The effectiveness of Service research would, in our view, be materially impaired if the present intimate relations between the research organisations and their respective Services were disturbed. Such a result would inevitably follow the transfer to a civilian Department of responsibility for the conduct of research. No civilian Department would be able to acquire at second hand the intimate knowledge of Service requirements possessed by the Fighting Department. Without such knowledge it would never succeed in giving to research the direction required by the peculiar conditions of the three Services, and its work would tend to become more and more unreal in character. Such results as it might obtain would, moreover, often fail to secure the acceptance of the&apos;Services.23. The conclusions which we have drawn from our review of the organisation set up in 1919 and of the subsequent developments in the organisation of the Fighting Services for Research make it impossible for us to endorse the following recommenda-tion contained in the Second Report of the Select Committee on Estimates (No. 119) :-&quot; Your Committee are also convinced that more attention could be given to prevent overlapping of the work of Scientific and Industrial Research under-taken by the Admiralty, the Air Ministry, and by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. It is felt that no opportunity should be lost to bring this work, so far as is possible and consistent with economy and efficiency, under the control of one Department.&quot;24. We believe that the most hopeful line of progress lies in the direction of improving the means at the disposal of the Fighting Services for effective co-operation rather than by a formal superstructure of co-ordinating machinery. Substantial progress has been made in this direction by the reorganisation at the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, to which we have referred, and the position will, we believe, be further improved if our proposals (paragraphs 17 to 20) in regard to the War Office are adopted. These developments have robbed the Co-ordinating Research Boards for Chemistry, Physics and Engineering of their former usefulness, and we recommend that they should be dissolved.25. Effective co-ordination between the Services in future can, it appears to us, be secured by the appointment, from time to time, of special ad hoc Committees for the consideration of particular problems. These ad hoc Committees should, we recommend, take the form either of Inter-Departmental Committees, or, in the case of inquiries with a wider scope, of Sub-Committees of the Committee of Civil Research. However constituted, they should contain representatives not only of the Fighting Services, but also of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and, where desirable, of the two Departments of Agriculture and of the Medical Research Council. It should, in our view, be open to any of the Fighting Services or to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research or other Depart-ments interested to suggest the appointment of ad hoc inquiries of this character. Discussions of these and similar problems would be facilitated by periodical meetings between the Directors of Scientific Research at the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, the proposed Scientific Adviser at the War Office and the Secretary of the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research, and we recommend that steps should be taken to establish meetings of this kind on the dissolution of the existing Boards; and that each officer should report annually to his Department on the results of these meetings.
XI.-CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF SCIENTIFIC STAFF INTHE FIGHTING SERVICES.Krst Beport, 27.   We have drawn attention to the advantage resulting from the adoptionparas, lie- , t^e Air Ministry for its scientific staff of the same methods of recruitment, 1 promotion, scales of pay and general conditions of appointment and work as thosein the Admiralty. In order to facilitate interchangeability of scientific staff between all the Fighting Services, we recommend that the whole question should be examined by the Treasury with a view to the adoption as far as possible of uniform conditions of service for scientific staff throughout the Fighting Services.XII.-RADIO RESEARCH.Fir&amp; ^52-rt&apos; ^n  generah   we  are of opinion  that  research  and  development  inisST&apos; wireless signalling and equipment are  possibly less well organised, and theexpenditure greater, than it need be owing to the existence of three Service Wireless Establishments dealing with this one subject. The fundamental principles involved in the design of a wireless set are the same whether the set is intended for use in a ship, on land or in the air.29. The choice of the Department which should undertake wireless research on any new subject of direct interest to more than one of the Fighting Services should depend on (a.) The Service which has most at stake;(&amp;.) The Service, if any, which is responsible for production;(c.) The Service which will be the greatest user;(d.) The facilities afforded in the various research establishments.30. We recommend, therefore, that all scientific and investigatory work on wireless for the Fighting Services should be concentrated in one joint establishment.31. A single wireless research establishment, such as we recommend, would secure the necessary degree of co-ordination between the three Services, and if this proposal is approved, there will be no room in future for the Radio Research Board usefully to perform co-ordinating functions. The Board has, however, done valuable work in other directions, and we, therefore, recommend that it should continue this part of its work, but that it should be relieved of its present duties in connection with co-ordination.32. With regard to development work, in which the first important signs of the different uses of the gear appear, the case is less straightforward, but we are of opinion that separate design and engineering staffs working on specific types of set in the same establishment would tend to economy, and that more favourable terms might be obtained by such an establishment when placing orders for standard component parts with outside manufacturers.33. The General Post Office which, so far as Radio research is concerned, has found the present machinery satisfactory, will no doubt determine in the light of experience whether it will be more convenient in future for its wireless work to be associated with the Radio Research Board or with the proposed single service establishment.XIII.-TECHNICAL RECORDS OF THE FIGHTING SERVICES AND OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH.J   W* tvt- -34- tS indicated in our First Report, the Admiralty and the Air wmS^ e adoPted a common system for their technical records. In the War Office technical records are maintained separately by the principal bodies responsible to the Master-General of the Ordnance for various categories of Research. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research possesses a small central Records Bureau, and, in addition, each of the various Research Institutes maintained or supported by the Department maintain technical records in regard to112, 120,139.
XIV. GENERAL RESEARCHES ON SUPPLY OF MATERIAL IN WARTIME.35. We have described the responsibility of the Board of Trade for studying First Report, in peace-time problems of general supply in time of war. These problems embrace para&apos;155&apos; the interests alike of the Fighting Services and of the civilian public. In order that due weight may be given to the claims for supply put forward from all sources, the Board are assisted by the Principal Supply Officers Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The President of the Board of Trade is Chairman of this Committee, which contains representatives of the Fighting Services, the Board of Trade and the Home Office. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research is also concerned with this problem in so far as research falling within its purview may be required for the solution of any particular problem. We recommend that, in order that the Committee may be fully representative of the various points of view, arrangements should be made for the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to be a member of the Principal Supply Officers Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.XV.-RESEARCFI GRANTS TO INDIVIDUALS.36. We have described in our First Report the nature of the grants given by the Government research organisations and.by the Royal Society to various classes of research worker. These grants have an important bearing on research for they provide for the recruitment and training of research workers, and in the case of senior workers for the promotion of independent research. Detailed considera-tion of the conditions on which they are made or the authorities by whom they are administered would, however, lead us considerably beyond our terms of reference. The question is intimately bound up with the provision for similar scholarships and grants now being made by the Universities, independent foundations and the like. We recommend that the existing provision of assistance to individuals by way of grant should be reviewed in relation to similar provision from other sources by an independent inquiry, at which all the bodies affected could have an opportunity of stating their views.XVI.-THE PUBLICATION  OF THE  RESULTS  OF RESEARCH.37. We have discussed the different methods that are employed for the publica- First Report, tion of the results of research in our First Report. We have drawn attention to the P^as-326-advantages of publication in the Proceedings and Transactions of learned Societies and in the Technical Journals, as compared with direct publication by Government Departments. We realise that in some cases direct publication may be necessary, but we recommend that the results of first-class scientific value secured as the result of research paid for by the Government should be published, where possible, through the appropriate learned Society or technical journal in preference to direct publica-tion by Government Departments.T19277] cResearch which they undertake. These records organisations are designed to meet the particular needs of the Institutes which they serve. We realise that certain diversity of system may be necessary owing to differences between various classes of Research and between the organisations of. one Department and another; but we consider that it avouM be worth while to explore the possibility of taking any steps for the more ready interchange of information between Departments through the establishment, where practicable, of uniform systems of technical records. We recommend, therefore, that the establishment, where practicable, of uniform systems of technical records should be examined jointly by the responsible technical officers of the Fighting Services and of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
XVII. THE ANNUAL REPORTS OF THE GOVERNMENT RESEARCHORGANISATIONS.First Report, 3g    jn our First Report we referred to the annual Reports of the Governmentpara. 329. research organisations, e.g., those of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research Council and Development Commission. We pointed out that&apos; these Reports stand on a different footing from documents actually embodying the results of original research. In view of their importance from the point of view of co-ordination, we recommend that in future they should be presented to Parliament as Command Papers.XVIII.-EXPENDITURE  ON  RESEARCH.39. We have been impressed in our survey by the difficulty in some cases of distinguishing accurately between expenditure on research and experiment and that on development. The distinction is a real one; for the methods and the amount of expenditure are of a different order. At present, for example, there are two Votes in the Navy Estimates containing items of expenditure both for research and for development. If steps were taken to group in a single Vote expenditure on research as distinguished from expenditure on development, a truer picture would be given to Parliament and to the public of the efforts undertaken by the Government in the furtherance of research.40. In the case of medical and industrial research, the form in which the Medical Research Council and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research have been organised permits a ready estimate of the expenditure involved, owing, no doubt, to the fact that little, if any, research is undertaken direct in these fields by other Departments. The position is rather more complicated in the case of agricultural research. The bulk of the expenditure of the Agricultural and the Fisheries Departments passes through the Development Fund. Moreover, there will always be cases where it will be difficult to draw the line between expenditure on agricultural research and that on agricultural education.41. We recommend, therefore, that in the preparation of&quot; the Estimates the Treasury should examine the form of the Estimates, in consultation with the Departments concerned, with a view to distinguishing as clearly as possible between expenditure on research and expenditure on development.42. We have not considered the adequacy or inadequacy of the expenditure on research incurred by the Government, as to do so would clearly be beyond our terms of reference.XIX.-SUMMARY  OF RECOMMENDATIONS.43.   Our recommendations may be summarised as follows : (a) that in order to avoid overlapping, steps should be taken by the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to ensure periodical review of the work being done by the Fuel Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, by the Safety in Mines Research Board and by the Universities;(6) that steps should be taken by the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry by joint negotiation with University authorities to remove as far as possible the disabilities attaching to their scientific staff owing to the secret nature of much of their work, which precludes them from publishing in the scientific journals advances&apos; in knowledge gained through their work;(p) that financial provision should be made for the supply of the necessary scientific publications to all the Experimental Establishments of the Navy;
(d) that the scientific research staff of the Air Ministry should form a single poolfrom which the Director of Scientific Research can draw for research requirements in any establishment;(e) that members of the Aeronautical Research Committee should not be eligiblefor reappointment at the end of their term of service until after an interval;(/) that as regards Meteorological research (i) the Air Ministry should continue  to  give full weight to the meteorological needs of other Departments;(ii) steps should be taken by the Air Ministry to ensure that adequateattention is given to the promotion of fundamental scientific work in meteorology;(g) that as an experimental measure, limited in the first instance to a period offive years, an officer comparable in scientific standing to the Directors of Scientific Research at the Admiralty and the Air Ministry should be appointed at the War Office to act as Scientific Adviser;(h) that as regards the co-ordination of research in the Fighting Services-(i) the Co-ordinating Research Boards of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research for Chemistry, Physics and Engineering should be dissolved;(ii) that in future special ad hoc Committees should be appointed fromtime to time for the consideration of practical problems;(iii) that the proposed ad hoc Committees should take the form either of inter-Departmental Committees, or, in the case of enquiries with a wider scope, of Sub-Committees of the Committee of Civil Research;(iv) that on such ad hoc Committees there should be representation notonly of the Fighting Services, but also of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and, where desirable, of the two Departments of Agriculture and of the Medical Research Council;(v) that it should be open to any of the three Fighting Services, or to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research or other Departments interested, to suggest the appointment of an ad hoc Committee for a special enquiry;(vi) that steps should be taken on the dissolution of the Boards referred to in (i) above to establish periodical meetings between the Directors of Scientific Research at the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, the proposed Scientific Adviser at the War Office and the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research; and that each officer should report annually to his Department on the results of these meetings; ii) that economic researches by the Fighting Services directed to the prolongation of the life of otherwise satisfactory materiel should be developed by those Departments as opportunity offers; (j) that the whole question of the conditions of employment of scientific staff inthe Fighting Services should be examined by the Treasury with a viewto the adoption, as far as possible, of uniform methods of recruitment,promotion,   scales  of  pay  and   general  conditions  of  appointmentthroughout the Fighting Services; (k) that as regards wireless research by the Fighting Services &apos;(i) all scientific and investigatory work on wireless should be concentrated in one joint establishment;(ii) steps should be taken to examine the question of the appointment of separate design and engineering staffs working on specific types of set in the same establishment; (iii) the  Radio  Research  Board  of  the  Department  of- Scientific and Industrial Research should be relieved of its co-ordinating functions;(I) that the establishment, where practicable, of uniform systems of technical records should be examined in concert by the responsible technical officers of the Fighting Services and of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research;
(m) that arrangements should be made for the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to be a member of the Principal Supply Officers Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence;(n): that the existing provision of assistance from Government by way of grant to the various classes of research worker should be reviewed in relation to similar provision from other sources by an independent Inquiry at which all the bodies affected could have an opportunity of stating their views;(o) that results of first-class scientific value secured through research paid for by the Government should be published, wdiere possible, through the appropriate learned Society or technical journal in preference to direct publication by Government Departments;(p) that, in view of their importance from the point of view of co-ordination, the Annual Reports of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research Council and the Development Commission should be presented to Parliament as Command Papers;(q) that in the preparation of the Estimates, the Treasury should examine the form of the Estimates, in consultation with the Departments concerned, with a view to distinguishing as clearly as possible between expenditure on research and expenditure on development&quot;(Signed).
