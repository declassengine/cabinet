(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  ROSERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^HE3S.ICRAHDUI.1 &quot;by the IBESIDEMT of the BOARD Off EDUCATION.It is a matter of great importance to Local Education Authorities to know immediately and before the end of this part of the Session the date when we propose to raise the sohool learing age.     Local Education Authorities are already at work on the programmes covering the period of the next three years, which have to be submitted to the Board of Education this autumn.     These programmes cannot he settled without a knowledge of the time of the change which is uni-versally expected.     The Directors of Education are expecting an immediate decision, and great difficulty and confusion would result from delaying an announcement.I recommend that April 1st, 1931, be thei date chosen and announced for   raising the school a^e.     That would give the Local Education Authorities a year and a half to prepare. It would be open to us to pass the necessary legislation either at the end of this session or early in the next.     The essential thing is that the Local Education Authorities should have the date definite, and the announcement -would incidentally placate the anxiety evidenced in our own party.It would be possible to raise the age earlier, i.e. on April 1st or August 51st, 1930, if it were urgently desired to use this means of reducing unemployment.     My Advisers consider that the earlier date would be practicable as an emergency measure but it would be a more serious call on the resources and ingenuity of the Local Education Authorities to meet the difficulties of accommodation and staffing.In considering the parliamentary question of the periodGOVERNMENT) .SECRET.CP. 204 (20.)C A B I 11 E T .RAISING    the   SCHOOL   LEAVING   ACE.
for the introduction of legislation there are tiro alleviating factors i-(1) No legislation is necessary for Scotland, as the age can be raised by administrative order from the Secretary of State.(2) The Bill required for England need not he much mere than a one clause Bill.Some of my colleagues are anxious about the unpopularity of the change in the textile districts.     Ho doubt thiB will manifest itself to some extent, though this time there has been no outburst of the traditional opposition to every raising of the age in Yorkshire and Lancashire because of the well-defined commitment of the Labour Party to maintenance allowances as an; accompaniment, ; There is, however, a strong feeling among many textile Members who have spoken to me that it would be politically advantageous to them if the legislation were passed as early as possible in this Parliament.Educationally the reason for an early date for raising the age iB that the numbers of children leaving school at 14 are at their lowest in the next three years owing to the decline in the birth-rate during the war.The figures of pupils between 14 and 15 who would stay in school if the age were raised are as follows -1931 452,0001932 373,0001933 393,0001934 509,0001935 580,0001936 559,0001937 504,000Educationally, therefore, it would be a mistake to wait till the peak years of 1934, 1955, 1936,
31Whenever the age is raised there are liable to &quot;be considerable difficulties facing the Local Education Authorities in finding accommodation and enlarged staffing for the additional pupil3. Emergency measures will need to &quot;be taken, in consultation with the Local Authorities, to provide temporary accomraedution, to expedite building of schools, and to pre cure a larger supply of teachers.   But the most difficult areas will regain difficult whenever the change cones.     And my advisers are of opinion that generally the problems can be met over nost of the oountry even if an early date is selected.In considering the cost of the change raach the most important ;mtter is the item of maintenance allowances.. These will have to be on a fairly liberal scale if they are to satisfy the expectations of our members and of parents.It will have to be decided whether allowances are to be given as a right or whether the local Education Authority is to award them in accordance with a need standard.It will also have to be decided whether the granting of allowances shall be made a requirement on the Local Education Authority.   IJy own view is that it would be doubtful policy to corcpel the Local Education Authorities to pay maintenance, and probably wiser to offer then increased financial inducements to adopt a liberal scale. I therefore recommend that the proportion of Exchequer grant be raised from 50 per cent, to 75     per cent, in the case of maintenance grants to children over 14*In the following estimates (Appendix) I have given as alternatives the lowest possible maintenance grant I can oonoeive our being able to get through Parliament, i.e*
325/- a week or  13 a year for one-third of the children involved, and the highest we are likely to  contemplate, i.e, 7/*- a week or  18.4s. a year for three-fourths of the children.     All intermediate possibilities can easily he calculated from these figures..In considering the educational cost of raising the school age it must always he remembered to set against it the saving in unemployment &quot;benefit and poor relief which is hound to result.     The effect of keeping half a million children annually out of the labour market cannot be accurately estimated but it cannot possibly be negligible. There is good reason for supposing that at least 300,000 children must obtain work during the year.     If only 1008000 unemployed were indirectly substituted for them, the national saving in benefit and relief might be estimated at  4,500 ,000 a year.
