S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.RET.      - COPY NO.       ^. 218(29).CABINET. RENT RESTRICTION. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1.      By the Expiring Lav/a Continuance Act of 1928 the Rent Restriction Acts were prolonged until the 25th December, 1929, in England and Ytoles and until the 28th May, 1930, in   Scotland.2*     A considerable number of questions as to the Governments intentions regarding the future of the Acts have been addressed to me in Parliament and it is very desirable that some announcement on the subject should be made before the House rises,  and on previous occasions announcements have been made before the end of the summer sdsslon.3.     We shall all be1 agreed that it would be quite Impossible for ue to allow rent restriction tb come to an end at the close of the present year and the real quesiion is whether immediately we should confine ourselves to continuing the Acts in their present form or whether we should attempt to pass an amending   Bill before Christmas. Any amending Bill must necessarily be extremely contentious and involve a good deal of Parliamentary time and I do not think that, If we are to make progress with a Housing Bill and the other urgent matters which must be dealt with in the Autumn, it would be practicable to pass a Bill amending the Rent Restriction Acts by Christmas.I propose, therefore, to provide for the continuance of the existing provisions in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill which it will be necessary to pass in the- 1 -
Autumn, and to make an announcement to that effect before the House rises.4*     The Secretary of State for Scotland has seen, and concurs in, this Memorandum.A.G.19th July, 1929.
