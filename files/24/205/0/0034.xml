S B 0 R E T o.GAB I M E T. ......CP. 234  (29)PROGRAMME    OF    LEGISLATION.M Memorandum by the Home Secretary0I have been considering the Prime Minister&apos;s. Memorandum (CP.217(29) regarding the.Parliamentary &quot;business for the Autumn and apart from the Factories Bill, which was mentioned in the King&apos;s Speech,  the only other Bill of importance for which I should like time to be found is one to amend the Children Act,  1908.As to the Factories Bill,  I much doubt whether it will be possible to have it ready for Second Reading within the first few days of reassembly3    it will be a large measure of some 140 odd clauses which will require very careful and detailed scrutiny by the Home Affairs Committee and the Cabinet before its introduction.    It will be remembered that we introduced a Factories Bill in 1924 and I shall have to consider, before the new Bill can be prepared and submitted to my colleagues what departures,  if any, from the provisions of the old Bill, whether on points of detail or issues of policy, have been justified or necessitated by the developments of the last five years.    This cannot and should not be done in a hurry:    we shall no doubt have critics on both sides of the House and we must be absolutely sure of our ground before we decide finally on our proposals.    Moreover,  it would, in my view, be desirable that the House should be asked to assent to the principle of the Washington Hours Convention before the Factories Bill comes up for Second Reading.    If this course is not followed,  the whole question of the eight hour day will inevitably be thrashed out on the Factories Bill.    The opponents of the Convention would not for one moment consider prejudicing their case against the 8 hour day by acquiescing in its application through the Factories Bill to industrial establishments.(This Document Is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government),
p. -211 II am inclined to think too that we would be ill-advised politically to ask the House to consider a Bill of the size and complexity of the Factories Bill only a day or two after the House meets.    Even if it were found possible to circulate the Bill a we&quot;-ek or so before the end of October, members would have a       * legitimate grievance in being asked to give a Second Reading to a Bill for consideration of which -they have had no reasonable o p p or tunity.In view of the foregoing considerations,  I think the most we should do Is to express a hope tb at the Government will be able to introduce a Factories Bill at the beginning of November with a view! to its obtaining a Second Reading in the third&apos;   week.An amending Children&apos;s Bill is urgent in the sense that it is long overdue, and    that we shall be subjected to pressure from many! quarters If we show no sign of moving in the matter.    Different parts of the field have been covered by the enquiries of three IDepartmental Committees - which reported as long ago as 1925 and I 1928, the Child Adoption Committee, (third report) the Juvenile Offenders Committee and the Sexual Offences against Young Persons I Committee, and the main object of a Bill would be to give effect tol recommendations made fey these Committees. Opportunity would at thej same time be taken J;o make minor amendments which the experience of the la.st twenty years has shown to  be necessary.The parsing of such a Bill would do much good, would be popular with a large body of opinion,  and sa ould not I think give rise to much controversy.    I am assured that it would be possible to have a Bill prepared in time for introduction in the Autumn -subject,  that is,  to the demands made by other Departments on the Parliamentary Draughtsmen     and I think some indication of our intention in this matter might well be given when the Government statement as to business is made.    I will of course at a later stage circulate a memorandum d&amp;aling in some detail with myIproposals aJ. R o C .23.7.29
