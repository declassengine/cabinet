Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET. Copy No.    00CP. 247 (29).(Also C.I.D. Paper No. 959-5.)CABINET.BAGHDAD-HAIFA RAILWAY AND TRANS-DESERT PIPE-LINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the report (B.H.R. 29 (11)) of the Sub-Committee of the Cabinet set up by the direction of the Prime Minister to consider the Baghdad-Haifa railway project and the pipe-line from the Iraq oil-fields to the Mediterranean. It will be seen that to the Sub-Committee&apos;s report are appended not less than three minority opinions. I regret that, partly owing to the short time available and the fact that several members of the Sub-Committee were unable to attend certain of the meetings, it has proved impossible to present an unanimous report. I fully realise that, accompanied by so many conflicting opinions, the report will not give any very clear guidance to my colleagues. I thought it better, however, not to delay the presentation of the report in the hope of achieving a greater measure of unanimity, but to give the Cabinet an opportunity to consider at once what I conceive to be the one really pressing question which has come before the Committee. I refer to the danger that, if we do not ourselves move in this matter of the trans-desert railway and pipe-line, the French authorities in Syria will forestall us.2. There is strong evidence that the French are contemplating the construction of a railway which will link up Deir-ez-Zor or Abu-Kamal on the Iraq border with a port on the Syrian coast, their avowed object being to induce the Iraq Petroleum Company to adopt that alignment for their trans-desert pipe-line. There is, I think, little doubt that, if a railway were constructed across the desert, that railway would in practice be adopted by the oil company as the alignment for their pipe-line. Not only would the existence of a railway immensely reduce the cost of the initial construction of the pipe-line, but it would make for important economies in the matter of annual upkeep.3. At one of the meetings of the Sub-Committee I asked Sir John Cadman, the Chairman of the Iraq Petroleum Company, what would be the effect if the French seriously proposed to construct a railway from Horns to the Euphrates, and whether such a project would influence the decision in regard to the alignment of the pipe-line. Sir John Cadman replied that if such a project were put forward in the near future, it would undoubtedly exercise a very strong influence in selecting the northern route as opposed to the southern route through British mandated territory.4. The evidence in our possession as to the French Governments intentions is admittedly not conclusive; but it is not such as can safely be ignored. In February last Sir Henry Dobbs, the late High Commissioner for Iraq, while staying as the guest of the High Commissioner for Syria at Beyrout, was informed by the latter that the French Government &quot;had decided to build at an early date a railway from Homs to the Euphrates.&quot; M. Ponsot added that when this was done &quot;no-one but a madman would contemplate the railway or pipe-line terminating at any other place than Tripoli.&quot; He showed Sir Henry Dobbs volumes of &quot;etudes&quot; on the subject of the projected railway. Since that date a certain amount of information (mainly from secret sources) has reached His Majesty&apos;s Government, all of which points to the fact that the French are really in earnest in their professed intention to build a railway across.the Syrian desert to the Euphrates.[19935]
That such is their intention received confirmation from the British Liaison Officer at Beyrout, who reported in March last that two experts from Paris had arrived in Syria to study the question of constructing the railway. More recently the Trench Government, in an official Note, confessed their desire to see a railway constructed through Syrian territory with Tripoli as its terminus and with a pipe-line debouching at that port. In this Note they expressly reserved to themselves the right to promote the construction of such a railway by all appropriate means. In April last Major Holt, who carried out last year a survey of alternative routes on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company, informed the Colonial Office in confidence that the Board of the Company had been given an explicit assurance that, whatever might be the cost, and whatever might be its natural disadvantages, the French Government would be prepared to build a first-class harbour at Tripoli if it were decided to bring the pipe-line there. This indicates to what lengths the French Government are prepared to go in order to influence the oil company in favour of a Syrian alignment for their pipe-line.5. There are therefore strong grounds for thinking that, if we take no steps ourselves to promote the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa, the French Government will anticipate us by building a railway across Syria, with the result that the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;s pipe-line will ultimately follow that route. It is for the Cabinet to decide whether or not this risk is one which may properly be taken. If the Cabinet consider that it should be guarded against, then I recommend as a first step that a detailed survey of the Baghdad-Haifa route be carried out on the lines suggested in the majority report of the Sub-Committee.. &apos;     P.Colonial Office, Downing Street, September 19, 1929.

BY the direction of the Prime Minister, a Cabinet Committee was set up with the following terms of reference : &quot;To advise the Cabinet at its next meeting as to the political aspects of the construction of the railway and/or pipe-line from Baghdad to Haifa.&quot;2.   The Committee was composed of the following Members : The Right Hon. Lord Passfield (Chairman), Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Colonies.The Right Hon. Thomas Shaw, C.B.E., M.P., Secretary of State for War.The Right Hon. Lord Thomson, C.B.E., D.S.O., Secretary of State for Air.Mr. G. M. Gillett, M.P., Board of Trade.Sir Oswald Mosley, Bart., M.P., Chancellor of Duchy of Lancaster. *Mr. F. W. Pethick Lawrence, M.P., Treasury.Secretary, Squadron Leader E. J. Hodsoll, Cabinet Offices. * Represented at two meetings by Mr. A. P. Waterfield, C.B., Treasury.Short Historical Note.1. A Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence drew up a report, dated the 13th June, 1928, on the construction of the Proposed Haifa-Baghdad Railway and/or Pipe-Line.* The conclusions reached by this committee are too numerous to be included here in full; it will be sufficient for our purposes to draw attention to their recommendations on the conditions of Government Aid (p. 18, para. 104):  &quot; In view of the uncertainty which at present surrounds the whole matter,, no action is necessary or desirable at the moment. If, however, proposals are&apos; submitted in the near future by or on behalf of the Oil Companies for participa-tion in the construction of a Baghdad-Haifa railway, and if the Cabinet decide in principle to assist in the construction of such a railway, their assent should be subject to the acceptance by the other interested parties of the following, among other, conditions : (a.) That the British Government are satisfied as to the financial status of the undertakers and as to capitalisation proposals.* C.I.D. Paper No. 886-B. [19915] B
(&amp;.) That the British, Iraq and Palestine Governments should together contribute an amount not exceeding  3 millions in the aggregate towards the cost of the undertaking, in such proportions as may be agreed between the three Governments.(c.) That the oil companies should participate in the construction of the railway by undertaking to subscribe for (and retain) at least one-third of the capital of the Railway Company.(d.) That the participation of the Governments in the Railway Company should be in such a form as will enable them to share in any future prosperity the Company may enjoy.(e.) That the oil companies should bind themselves in advance to lay their pipe-lines alongside the railway on such terms as to way leaves, &amp;c, as may be agreed between the oil companies and the Railway Company.&quot;2. In accordance with the recommendations of the Sub-Committee, no further action was taken in this matter, which was not submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence.3. When the new Government assumed office, however, the question of the con-struction of this railway was brought to the notice of the Cabinet and was referred to the Committee on Unemployment, under the chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal; it being understood that, if such construction could be undertaken, considerable orders for railway material might be secured by British Firms, which would help directly to relieve unemployment in certain trades.It was found, however, that the whole proposal was, politically, too nebulous to be considered as a direct measure for the alleviation of unemployment, and it was referred back, by order of the Prime Minister, to a Cabinet Committee to consider the higher political aspects and submit definite recommendations thereon.4. A further reason for the urgent consideration of this proposal was the fear that the French Government might forestall us in the construction of a railway in this area; it was realised fully that if this occurred it would most certainly exercise a strong influence on the alignment of the projected pipe-line, and it was thought undesirable, from every point of view, to leave the French a clear field without careful examination of the British interests involved.5. We have accordingly held three meetings, at the second of which we had the advantage of the presence of Sir John Cadman. We regret that we have been unable to arrive at a unanimous opinion in regard to our conclusions. Shortness of time and the unavoidable absence of some of the members of the committee have made it impossible for us to hold any further meetings; and, in consequence, minority statements by Mr. W. Graham, Sir Oswald Mosley and Mr. Pethick Lawrence have been drawn up and are attached to this report, setting out their views where they are at variance with our conclusions.   (See Annexures 1, 2 and 3 respectively.)Our Position in Iraq.6. In making any recommendation in regard to the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa, we realised at once that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, vis-a-vis Iraq, had an important bearing on the whole subject. If it was proposed, at any time, to withdraw entirely all British interests from this country, then it would be extremely doubtful if it would be worth while to consider the railway project, whatever other advantages it might hold out. We were given to understand, however, that it was not proposed to alter the status quo for the next three years, since we were in any case bound, in 1932, to support Iraq&apos;s candidature for membership of the League of Nations. When Iraq is admitted to membership of the League we presume that the Cabinet will reconsider the whole question of our relations, both political and military, with this country. It is obviously outside our terms of reference to comment on this point, but we should like to state definitely our opinion that, if it is decided to proceed with the construction of the railway, we think it should be on the understanding that we are not thereby prejudicing any future decision which might involve the withdrawal of the British Military Forces from Iraq.
7.   If this is the general intention, then we are satisfied that, from this aspect, there can be no objections to the construction of the railway.Our Position in Palestine and Trans-Jordania.8. Of equal importance to our position in Iraq is the continuance of the present status quo iat our relations with Palestine and Trans-Jordania, and for similar reasons to those which we have outlined in paragraph 6 above. We are given to understand that, since we have been entrusted with the mandates for these two territories, we have, in fact, assumed an obligation of indefinite extent, and that the possibilities of any important change in our relations vis-a-vis these two countries is very remote.9. If our information is correct, there will be no danger either of increasing our political commitments in these two countries if the railway is made, or of sinking British capital in an enterprise over which we may, ultimately, have little or no control (see also paragraphs 12 and 13).The Attitude of Iraq, Palestine and Trans-J ordania to the Construction of the Railway.10. We have been informed that the Governments of the respective countries will be favourably disposed towards this project. We can see no reason why this should not be so; at the same time, we have no information as to whether any of them would be prepared to give practical support or to become financially interested.11. We regard it as essential that the attitude of these countries should be stated definitely at an early date, so that we may be in possession of the fullest information from those to whom this proposal will be of practical application.Possible Military Commitments implied by the Construction of the Railway.*12. Although, as stated above, we do not visualise any increase in our political responsibilities in these areas, we feel a little doubtful in regard to the military implications of this scheme. We have studied the Reports of the Chiefs of Star!&apos; Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 884-B), and the Joint Planning Sub-Committee (C.O.S. 151 (J.P.)), and also a memorandum by the Overseas Sub-Committee (Paper No. O.D.C. 546-M), which all deal, in some detail, with the defence problems involved. From these reports it is apparent to us that, by authorising the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa, His Majesty&apos;s Government would undoubtedly be accepting certain additional military commit-ments. Under normal conditions these commitments will be of a comparatively minor nature, but, in the unfortunate event of a war with France, we might find ourselves under fairly onerous obligations. The considered opinion of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on this point is of interest, and is as follows : &quot; The principal disadvantage is certain added commitments in regard to defence. This, however, is small, except in the case of a war with France, and is completely outweighed by the advantages. In these circumstances, we consider that it is of the greatest importance that the pipe-line and railway should be kept within British territory.&quot; (C.I.D. Paper No. 884-B, paragraph 4.) -*13. We are not concerned primarily with the military aspect of this project; we feel it our duty, however, to point out that certain military obligations are implicated therein. The question whether the military commitments entailed would be justified by the benefits which Great Britain would obtain is a subject about which we do not feel ourselves at present competent to judge, particularly as the Cabinet has yet to decide upon the broadest aspects of the subject as raised by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in paragraph 16 of CP. 214 (29).* Note by the Secr-etary of State for War relative to paragraphs 12 and 13.I am not prepared to agree to what would be virtually the creation of a &quot; Suez Canal&quot; problem in Iraq, and cannot consent to any idea of a permanent occupation of Iraq by British troops. I am in favour of the survey in order that we may clearly understand what the costs and possibilities of a railway and pipe-line are.   That is as far as I can go.[19915] b 2
The Commercial Possibilities of the Railway.(a.) Possible Oil Traffic.14. Sir John Cadman explained to us, very clearly, the position in Iraq and South Persia in regard to the potentialities of oil production. The newly opened Iraq oil-fields, which are situated in the vilayets of Mosul and Baghdad, are being explored by the Iraq Petroleum Co. lately known as the Turkish Petroleum Co.  which has received concessions, on certain terms, from the Iraq Government. The Board of this Company consists of British, American, French and Dutch, each representing a holding of 23-75 per cent.; the remaining 5 per cent, being the property of a British-Armenian named M. Gulbenkian. The Board represents roughly two Groups, of which the French-American combination are less favourable to British interests than the other; we gather that it is impossible to say, at present, which Group is likely to exert the strongest influence.15. The present agreement between the Iraq Government and the Iraq Petroleum Company is unsatisfactory, for a number of reasons, and negotiations are shortly to be held with a view to its revision. The main points which the Company wish to obtain are the extension of the time limit in regard to their surveys, and the allocation to them of a smaller area in which they can remain in undisturbed possession.16. The potentialities of these new oil-fields are considerable, however, so much so that the Company has already spent over two million pounds sterling in their surveys, and a stage has been reached when it can almost definitely be stated that there is sufficient oil to warrant the construction of a pipe-line to a port on the Mediterranean; a survey, to ascertain the most suitable alignment, has actually been authorised.Apart from the valuable oil supplies which the geological surveys have indicated, there is. Sir John Cadman added, a further inducement to the Company to prepare for the commercial production of oil in this area at an early date, in that the present oil consumption of America is increasing at such a rate as will compel her to seek supplies from elsewhere in the near future.From every point of view it is, in fact, evident that the supplies of oil in the Iraq fields are of high importance.17. From the evidence of Sir John Cadman we are satisfied that it is the intention of the Iraq Petroleum Company to develop; what appears to be from present surveys, a rich oil-bearing district with big commercial possibilities, which will lead to considerable traffic to and from some port on the Mediterranean.18. The South Persian oil-fields have been operated by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for some twenty years, and there can be no doubt, in consequence, as to their commercial value. Sir John Cadman informs us that the output of these fields is at present at a rate of approximately 50 per cent, of their capacity, and that new wells are still being opened up. We were also informed that, in the event of a pipe-line and railway being constructed from Iraq to a port on the Mediterranean, it would be very probable, that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would endeavour to connect up their fields with this system.Two important economies could be effected if this was done, which would more than counter-balance the capital outlay required : firstly, there would be a saving of a 6,400 miles journey by sea in conveying the oil to European markets; secondly, the very heavy dues now imposed bv the Suez Canal Company would be evaded. (Tn 1927 these were  900,000.*)19. From this evidence we think it probable that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would show considerable interest in the proposed railway and pipe-line, and, should they decide to link up their oil-fields with the Northern Iraq system, a noticeable increase in the oil traffic, with resultant benefit to the railway and port, would result.&quot; C.I.D. Paper No. 937-B, paragraph 31 (c), p. 11.
(b.) Commercial Possibilities other than Oil.20. We have made enquiries in regard to any other commercial significance, apart from oil, which a railway from Baghdad to Haifa might possess : such evidence as we could collect was of a somewhat hypothetical nature, but it seems possible that such a line would be of definite benefit to Palestine and Trans-Jordania, and that it might stimulate production in Iraq. It was also suggested to us that, in view of the railway policy being initiated by Persia at the present time, as exemplified by the construction of a railway trans-Persia linking up the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, and the fact that the alignment Haifa-Baghdad coincides with a centuries-old trade route, the railway might be the means of reviving commercial intercourse between Persia, the Persian Gulf, Iraq, Palestine and Egypt.21. We hesitate to express any opinion on such conjectural speculations, but we are prepared to say that there do appear to be certain commercial possibilities in this railway, apart from oil, and that the substitution of the train for the camel may act as an incentive to increased commercial intercourse between the countries concerned. We also understand that there are distinct possibilities of a wheat export trade being built up in Iraq, if the opening up of that country continues undisturbed.Influence of the Railway on the Alignment of the Pipe-line.22. Sir John Cadman explained to us, as noted in paragraph 16, that a survey was being undertaken in order to ascertain the best route for the pipe-line to follow from the Iraq oilfields to the Mediterranean coast; what the result of this survey would be he was not prepared to predict at the present juncture.23. It appears fairly certain, however, that the knowledge that a railway was to be constructed would exercise a very marked influence on the alignment of the pipe-line; in fact, from what we have been told we are convinced that the railway alignment wrould definitely be accepted for the pipe-line, unless any unforeseen factors suddenly appeared. If, however, the only project before the Company was a military railway from Horns to Deir ez Zor, but no further (see paragraph 26 below), it is not clear how much influence such a proposal would have on their choice of a route for the pipe-line.24.   There are four possible alignments which the pipe-line might follow : (1.) Kirkuk-Alexandretta, (2.) Kirkuk-Tripoli, (3.) Kirkuk-Beirut, (4.) Baghdad-Haifa,The advantages and disadvantages of these routes have been summarised in paragraphs 45-50 of the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence,* and it will be sufficient to say that routes (1) to (3) inclusive involve a pipe-line terminus in French territory, while route (4), besides bringing the terminus into British territory, is, without question, much the safest route, although in distance it is decidedly the longest.Sir John Cadman assures us that the question of safety is one of high importance and must influence, considerably, the Board in making their final decision.Advantages of securing the Pipe-Line Terminus in British Territory.25.   The advantages of securing the terminus of the pipe-line in British territory may be summarised briefly as follows : &apos;(a.) The securing to ourselves of the oil supplies from the Iraq oil-fields, both in peace and war; if the French secure the pipe-line terminus it is possible that there will be supply difficulties in peace time, and in war they may be entirely cut off.(b.) Since it has been decided to construct a port at Haifa, the securing of the pipe-line terminus will add considerably to its prosperity and importance.(c.) On strategic grounds&apos; generally, the advantages are considerable (vide C.I.D. 230th meeting, Minute 1, and CCS. report, C.I.D. Paper 884-B, paragraphs 2 and 3).* C.I.D. Paper No. 8s6-B.
The Possibilities of the French constructing a Railway.26. We have been unable to secure any very positive information on this matter but we believe that the French Government are fully alive to the advantages that might accrue to them if they undertook the construction of such a railway. There is definite evidence that they are maturing such a project, but we are unable to say, with any confidence, how far advanced their plans may be. There has been talk of their building a railway from Homs to Deir ez Zor, on the Euphrates, about half-way between Tripoli and Kirkuk; and it is possible that what they have in mind, principally, is a strategic rather than a commercial undertaking; and that the completion of the line to join up with the existing railway system in Iraq may be left over till a future date. It may also be fairly assumed that finance and other practical difficulties will have to be faced by the French, as they would be by us, and will cause considerable delay. We do not even know for certain whether they have carried out a survey of the proposed route.All that can be said is that there is a certain risk of the French forestalling us, and that, therefore, if the Government should decide to proceed further in this matter, action should not be too long deferred.The Cost of Constructing the Railvjay.27. Three separate and distinct proposals have been put forward; they are as follows : (a.) The contribution of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be limited to a capital expenditure of  3,000,000 shared, in such proportion as may be decided, conjointly with the Governments of Iraq and Palestine. (C.I.D. Paper No. 886-B, paragraph 104.)(&amp;.) His Majesty&apos;s Government should guarantee the security and interest, amounting to  336,000 for fifty years, on a loan of from 10 to 12 million pounds sterling.   (C.I.D. Paper No. 886-B, paragraph 83.)(c.) His Majesty&apos;s Government should contribute  300,000 for five years.28. These estimates have been considered by us, but we are of the opinion that they are, in their present state, too vague in character. Of the three figures quoted, only (&amp;) bears any relation to the actual cost of the project, the remaining two being merely suggestions as to the limits beyond which His Majesty&apos;s Government should not go. &quot;Until more direct evidence of the actual cost of the project is available, we consider it idle to attempt to define the share that His Majesty&apos;s Government should bear; we would go further, and state that we cannot give any definite recommendation as to the policy His Majesty&apos;s Government should pursue until a definite estimate has been examined.The Need for a Detailed Survey.29. This leads us to the recommendation that a detailed survey is the first and most important consideration in connection with this project. From the evidence which we have examined there would appear to be the elements of a good case for the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa; we feel, however, that we should be entirely unjustified in submitting a definite recommendation in this sense before being in a position to postulate the cost involved. We would even venture to suggest that no Government would be justified in assenting to a proposal involving the Exchequer in unknown expenditure, possibly spread out over a term of years.30. The determination, accurately, of the cost of any project of this nature can only, be made after a detailed survey has been carried out on the spot, and we are sufficiently impressed with the possibilities of the scheme to recommend definitely that such a survey should be initiated.31. We have considered, further, the best means of executing this survey; two alternatives exist: (a.\ For His Majesty&apos;s Government to undertake it.(b.) For His Majesty&apos;s Government to entrust it to private enterprise.At first sight alternative (b) may appear preferable, and it might be urged that the obvious agents should be the Iraq Petroleum Company, who will have a major
interest in the project. This, however, would involve asking the Company to take sides in the political rivalry between the British and French interests, and it is clear to us, after hearing Sir John Cadman&apos;s evidence, that they would decline to do this, and that we ought not to press them to do so.Nor do we recommend that the work be entrusted to any other outside body. The only other group known to be interested at present is Sir Albert Stern and hia friends, whose proposals the Stanhope Sub-Committee were unable to recommend (C.I.D. Paper No. 886-B, paragraph 88). To invite them to carry out the survey-would not only practically commit the Government to accepting that particular group as the promoters of the scheme if it were finally approved, but would go far towards committing the Government to approval of the scheme in principle, subject to satisfactory financial arrangements; indeed, it is very unlikely that the group would undertake the task except on some assurance by the Government to this effect. If, however, the Government itself undertook the work, they would acquire full, accurate and first-hand information as to the cost, and would thus have their hands greatly strengthened when the time for bargaining arrived; and they could make it perfectly clear that they were in no way committed to the principle of participation. Furthermore, the cost of the survey could quite legitimately be recovered from the concessionnaires if it was decided to proceed with the scheme. We recommend, therefore, alternative (a).The Cost of a Survey.32. In regard to the cost of such a survey, we are informed that  100,000 should entirely cover all the expenses; we give this figure tentatively, however, and subject to confirmation by expert opinion.33. As to how this money should be found, we can naturally only put forward suggestions. The source that most readily occurs to us is the Colonial Development Fund, though we understand there may be difficulties in regard to financing any work . in Iraqi territory, this country having been especially excluded from the conditions of any grants.-34. We incline to the recommendation that the cost of the survey should be borne in part from the Colonial Development Fund and in part by the Iraq Govern-ment. The apportionment need not necessarily be based upon, the mileage to be surveyed in the respective territories, as this would place the principal burden on Iraq. It might reasonably be adjusted to the respective interests of the territories concerned.Political Implications if a Survey is undertaken.35. We have given some attention to any political reactions that might be set up by the knowledge that we were officially interested in this railway project, since we are aware that a certain definite promise was given to France by the late Government to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not bring pressure to bear on the Iraq Government to induce them to insist in their negotiations with the Iraq Petroleum Company on the adoption of the Southern alignment for the pipe-line.*36. We do not believe, however, that any decision of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to authorise a survey for the alignment of a railway between Baghdad and Haifa can have any untoward repercussions in the political world. We do think, however, that such a survey may give a direct stimulus to British elements and enterprise, and may help, quite legitimately, to secure the pipe-line trace on the Southern or British line.Recent Events in Palestine.37. We have given careful consideration to the recent disturbances in Palestine, and any bearing they might have on our assumption that the Southern alignment is the most secure. We do not think, however, that these riots, which were purely of a communal nature and were not engineered, so far as we can see, against the principle of British rule, can be regarded in any light sufficiently strong9 CP. 80 (29), paragraph 22.
Summary of Recommendations.38.   Briefly, then, our principal recommendations are as follows :-(a.) That there appear to be, primd facie, a number of advantages in con-structing a railway from Baghdad to Haifa, and that, despite certain objections, the chief of which as an added military commitment in certain of the areas, we are of the opinion that the whole project is worthy of closer investigation.(b.) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should take early steps to ascertain the opinions of the Governments of Palestine and -Iraq on the proposal to construct a railway line frOm Baghdad to Haifa, and whether the latter Government would be prepared to be financially interested in the project.(c.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake a detailed survey of the alignment Baghdad-Haifa, with a view to ascertaining accurately the cost of constructing a railway between these two points.(d.) That part of the cost of the survey should be borne by the Colonial Development Fund, and that the Iraq Government should be approached with a view to securing their financial co-operation.(e.) That no final decision should be made in regard to this project until the results of this survey are available, and have been carefully examined in such a manner as the Cabinet may direct.(Signed) PASSFIELD.T. SHAW. THOMSON.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, September 11, 1929.to alter our opinion. We regard them as being indigenous to any country like Palestine with a heterogeneous and semi-oriental population, and we are further influenced in our opinion by the fact that the Palestine Arabs were alone involved; such unrest as was manifested outside the Palestine borders being allayed with little or no trouble.
ANNEXURE 1. The Baghdad-Haifa Railway.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I. WHEN the original proposal for the grant of Government money to facilitate the building of the railway (C.P. 215 (29)) was put forward, the Petroleum Depart-ment held the view, in which the Board of Trade concurred, that it was a matter of first importance in time of war that the pipe-line should terminate at Haifa, and that to secure this alignment the construction of a railway from Bagdad to Haifa was very desirable. It appeared and still appears unlikely that the railway will be constructed in the near future as an independent commercial venture.2. The Board felt, however, that in the present state of international affairs the expenditure of Government money to secure this could not be justified by these considerations alone. It was the suggestion that the construction of the railway would contribute to the relief of unemployment in the heavy industries in this country that led the Board to form the opinion that it should be put in hand with Government aid. The proposal now before the Cabinet, as set out in the Report of the Committee (B.H.R. (29) 6), is of a different character the expenditure of Government money for a survey of the proposed route for the railway. This proposal, if adopted, would give no immediate assistance to British industry nor to the unemployment problem.3. Unless there is a real danger that the terminal of the pipe-line, when it is constructed, will not debouch at Haifa, the Board of Trade&apos;s view remains the same  that while for war purposes the termination of the pipe-line at Haifa is important, they can advance no sufficient argument on these grounds to justify in present circumstances the expenditure of Government money on the survey for the railway.4. The issue now before the Cabinet is a simple one. Is it necessary to spend Government money in order to prevent the French from promoting the construction of a railway connecting up the port of Tripoli with Deir-ez-Zor on the Iraq frontier and thereby influencing the alignment of the Baghdad-Mediterranean pipe-line ?5. It is probable, in the view of the Board, that ultimately the expense of the proposed survey may be borne by the Iraq&apos; Petroleum Company. The Company are not at present offering to undertake the work presumably because they wish to hold the offer in reserve as a bargaining point in their forthcoming negotiations with the Government of Iraq. It is of interest to note that the Iraq Petroleum Company have already formed a survey party, comprising three Americans, a Frenchman and an Englishman, which reached Beyrout at the end of August. They are to examine the coast-line from Alexandretta to Haifa before proceeding on the desert survey proper. An American pipe-line expert is in charge of the party, which is concerned, with the choice of the best route for a pipe-line and will not touch the question of a railway.6. Until some definite step is taken by the French which makes it certain that they will incur the enormous expenditure required to make Tripoli a suitable port and to complete the railway, consideration of this matter of the survey can in my view be safely deferred in anticipation that expenditure by the Government will ultimately prove unnecessary. I feel that the position is not at present so urgent as to compel the Government to defend in the House of Commons an estimate which will give rise to a difficult and embarrassing debate.(Initialled) W.

ANNEX URE 2.Memorandum by Sir Oswald Mosley on the Proposal to Spend  100,000 upon a Survey for a Baghdad-Haifa Railway.1. IT is submitted that considerable consequences would ensue from the decision to spend  100,000 on a survey for a Baghdad-Haifa Railway, which should be carefully considered before any final decision is reached. The spending, even of a small sum, on such an object will be accepted by the House of Commons, and by the country, as a definite commitment of policy which is connected both with oil and with military strategy. It will presumably have to be defended in the House of Commons on such grounds as no authority is apparently prepared to claim that, apart from such considerations, the railway will be a commercial proposition.2. The initiation of the survey will be understood to mean that the present Government intends a policy of capital expansion in Iraq which must almost certainly be supported by Government finance in the form of guarantee or direct subvention. Such a clear implication will have to be defended in the light of the Party&apos;s reiterated declarations in favour of reducing and liquidating our commitments of every kind in that region.3. To claim in the House of Commons that the survey commits us to nothing and need have no ulterior meaning is scarcely a tenable position. We shall be asked whether, in the event of the survey being satisfactory, we intend to promote the building of the railway. If we have no such intention there is clearly no object in the spending of money on the survey. If we have such intention, we shall clearly be obliged to defend ourselves in all the aspects of military, financial, and foreign policy which that intention involves. An opposition at all alive to their opportunities will make the spending of  100,000 on a railway survey the occasion for a full Parliamentary discussion of our policy in Iraq. In such event it appears on the evidence submitted to the Committee relative to the projected railway that the Government will have to admit : 1. That increased military commitments are involved. (B.H.R. (29) 1st Cons, pp. 3, 4, 5, 6.)2. That, apart from oil, the Railway is probably not a commercial proposition. (B.H.R. (29) 1st Cons. p. 9.)3. That even if the maximum hopes of the Committee in regard to oil are realised, we cannot be assured that the Railway will be a commercial proposition.   (B.H.R. (29) 1st Cons. p. 9 et infra.)4. That we have no assurance whatever that the oil pipe will follow the Baghdad-Haifa route rather than the shorter Northern route. (B.H.R (29) 2nd Cons. p. 5.   B.H.R. (29) 1st Cons. p. 17.)5. That our hopes that the oil pipe will follow the Baghdad-Haifa route rest solely upon the view that the Company will regard that route as more secure.   (B.H.R. (29) 1st Cons. p. 8.   B.H.R. (29) 2nd Cons. p. 5.)6. That events which have occurred in Palestine since the foregoing opinion was stated in the Committee must seriously diminish both our own confidence in this direction and public support for the project.7. That our belief in the superior safety of the Southern route over the Northern rests not upon the superiority of our forces in that region over those of the French, but upon our belief in Arab goodwill and upon our subsidies to the Tribes.   (B.H.R. (29) 1st Cons, p, 8.)8. That, in the event of a period of disorder arising in this region, the French could prove to the satisfaction of the Oil Company that their forces available in this neighbourhood are superior in strength to our own.9. That, in the event of serious disorder arising after the construction of the Railway and pipe-line in this region, we shall be obliged to draft far stronger forces to the area than if they had not been constructed.4. It is submitted that, before the Government proceeds with the recommendation, further consideration should be given to these questions, with special regard to recent events.
5. Other matters of substance are sribmitted in relation to the effect of this project upon the unemployment problem. The Ministers charged with this problem are frequently confronted by the suggestion that limits must be imposed upon the amount of loans which can be raised with Government assistance and encouragement by considerations relative to the general credit position of the country. At various times we have been informed that the amount to be raised in loans for home develop-ment must be limited by such considerations. If, then, we are informed that only a limited pool of such loans is available for development purposes, are we right to dip deeply into that pool for purposes of development in Iraq, only to be told at a later date that we have exhausted the pool and that we must curtail our projects for development in britain? Before we embark upon a policy which must imply sub-stantial loans from this country with Government assistance for Middle Eastern purposes, should we not ask the Treasury for a more precise definition of their views in this respect ?6. A further ancillary point arises in this connection. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has appealed publicly for a curtailment of foreign lending. In what position is the Government if it encourages and assists such foreign lending, especially when only a proportion of such loans will be spent in this country, as is inevitable in the case of a railway.7. Furthermore, it is admitted that some direct and substantial charge must fall on the Exchequer in the building of this railway; yet it is frequently suggested that at some time some limits will be set on such charges.. Will this encroachment upon our resources deplete funds which would otherwise be available for home develop-ment ? Constant demands are made upon us for further State assistance of development plans in this country. Some local authorities in very distressed areas claim that they can initiate no local plans to provide work without more assistance than is now offered by the Government. Is South Wales to go short in order to provide a railway in Iraq, over which effective British control largely terminates in 1932 ? Are we to curtail plans for the acceleration of work in this country for the same reason 1 Evidence is available to show that our road programme could be greatly accelerated if the State supported a larger proportion of the cost, or itself embarked on national schemes in addition to those undertaken by the local authorities. Is not a road in England as useful to the people of this country as a railway in Iraq ? It will, at any rate, provide more employment in this country per pound spent than a railway in Iraq.8. Such dilemmas must ultimately concern us unless we may proceed on the assumption that funds for these purposes are unlimited. It is submitted that the time has come to review the funds available for dealing with unemployment and their allocation. If we proceed without system in this matter we may dissipate resources in remote and speculative projects, which may soon be urgently required for sound propositions of home development. It is, however, contended that strategic advantages will inure from the construction of the projected Railway and Pipe Line in the undecided event of the Company preferring our route to that of the French. Against these advantages must be set the international and parlia-mentary repercussions of our embarking on what is nothing less than a scramble for oil against the French. The possibilities of agreement and compromise in the sphere of foreign policy might at least be explored before we commit ourselves to a struggle of such character and of such doubtful issue.9. In brief summary, it is submitted that the project commits us 1. In the military aspect, to a greater and dangerous obligation. 2. In the foreign policy aspect, to a struggle with the French, of wide reactions. 3. In the business aspect, to a gamble in which no authority can assure us a commercial return.4. In the unemployment aspect, to a possible curtailment of our resources for the promotion of sounder and more useful projects, and to the certainty that money thus expended would employ more men if expended at home.(Signed) OSWALD MOSLEY.September 12, 1929.
ANNEXURE 3.The Baghdad-Haifa Railway.Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.1. THE building of a railway from Haifa to Baghdad at the present time cannot be regarded as a commercial proposition. That is to say, whatever may be the commercial return, it may confidently be expected to be substantially less than would be required to cover the interest on the amount expended. If, therefore, the railway is to be proceeded with, it must be because there are on balance other advantages, mainly strategic, which are held to justify this anticipated loss.. 2. It is suggested, however, in, the report by the Committee that all that need be decided at present is to undertake an exact survey. But, assuming the survey is made and discloses ho unexpected difficulties or excessive cost of building the railway, what will be the position ? It will then be contended that not to proceed further is to stultify the original decision. This is so evident in advance that it will be difficult to-day to justify in the House of Commons the survey unless we are prepared to admit that, provided it is favourable, it is intended to proceed further. To attempt to defend the spending of  100,000 (with lib advantage to unemployment) merely to get information, would, in my opinion, be to court a charge of insincerity.3. The issue, therefore, as I see it, comes back to whether the Cabinet on grounds of high policy are inclined to embark on a non-commercial venture of this kind, and whether they consider that they can successfully recommend to the House of Commons what will be regarded as a first step towards it.4. My own view is that the evidence so far disclosed does not render an early decision imperative. It is true that we are informed that some months ago the French expressed an intention of building.a railway along the Northern route, but they haVe apparently taken no step towards the fulfilment of this intention, and we shall have ample time to reconsider our position if any further positive information reaches us.5. At the same time delay will enable us to judge better (a) how things are working-out in Palestine, (b) the development of our commitments in Iraq, (c) the commercial prospects of the railway, including the intentions of the oil company.6. Finally, Over-eagerness to build or subsidise or survey the railway will weaken bur bargaining power vis-a-vis all the other interests who are anxious to have the railway constructed.7. My recommendation, therefore, is that no decision be taken for the present, but that the matter be reconsidered if any fresh facts come to light.(Signed) F. W. PETHICK-LAWRENCE.September 16, 1929.o
