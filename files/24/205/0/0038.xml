[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;b Government.] Printed J or the Cabinet.   September 1929.SECRET. CP. 238 (29). (PART II.)CABINET.THE HAGUE CONFERENCE, 1929.Synopsis (continued) from August 24, 1929, to the End of the First Stage.*Part II.The Settlement.54. The first part of this Report closed on the information that M. Jaspar and the other Inviting Powers were getting to work again on another final offer, and that to give him a little more time the meeting of Delegations of the Inviting Powers arranged for the afternoon of Friday, the 23rd August, had been postponed until the following day. The meeting was subsequently adjourned at the call of the Chair.55. On Saturday, the 24th August, Mr. Snowden sent M. Jaspar a note, which he had prepared late the night before, with a view to speeding up a final offer (Appendix V). In the last paragraph it will be observed that Mr. Snowden asks for a definite statement in writing of the final proposals which the other Creditor Powers were prepared to make in order to meet his views, and which he hoped would represent a substantial advance beyond those which M. Jaspar had outlined on Thursday evening. He asked that this statement might arrive before the meeting arranged for the following afternoon, as in the absence of a definite document he feared that no useful object was likely to be secured by having that meeting. M. Jaspar showed some annoyance on being handed this note by Sir Maurice Hankey at 9 a.m., and more particularly at the suggestion that the latest proposals were merely a repetition of what.had previously been suggested by the other Creditor Powers.&apos; On quietening down, however, he noted that Mr. Snowden had asked for a substantial advance,&quot; and commented that this was not 100 per cent. He said his great difficulty- in approaching the other Powers was that he had no idea what Mr. Snowden would take.56. Shortly after 11-30 M. Jaspar called on Mr. Snowden, as a result of which a meeting of the Six Inviting Powers, which had been postponed for that afternoon, was further postponed at the call of the Chair. M. Jaspar left a written reply (Appendix VI), in which he undertook to notify the Heads of Delegations of the other Creditor Powers, promising a letter as soon as possible, but not guaranteeing, having regard to the short length of time available, that the reply could be sent before 4 o&apos;clock in the afternoon.57. Saturday passed and Sunday passed. It was known that the Delegations of the other Creditor Powers were hard at work, but it was not until the morning of Monday, the 26th August, that the reply was received.58. Before turning to the reply it is necessary to mention certain other events that were happening. It will be remembered that in paragraph 52 of Part I of this Report the British Delegation, on Friday, the 23rd August, had telegraphed to the Prime Minister asking if a Cabinet Meeting could be held at The Hague on Sunday, the 25th August.  The position of the Delegation at this time was rather* Note. This Memorandum is of a general character only, and may require correction in some technical details.   It should therefore be regarded as provisionaUonly. M. P. A. H.[19848] 1 b43Copy No.
difficult. The situation was so critical that if they were to comply, by means of personal consultation, as they felt obliged to do, with the Cabinet Minute of the 27th July, quoted in the previous Part of this Report, they were bound either to return home or to meet the Cabinet in Holland. To return home would, it was thought, risk the disruption of the Conference. On the other hand, for the Cabinet to come to Holland would undoubtedly cause great excitement. On the whole, the latter course was felt to be the less objectionable of the two.59. The telegram of the 23rd August, suggesting a meeting in The Hague, however, was sent under the impression that a new offer was to be received almost at once. The long delay on Saturday, the 24th August, in preparing the reply, altered the situation somewhat. If it became known to the other Delegations that the Prime Minister and Cabinet were coming to The Hague on Sunday, the nature of their offer was almost certain to be altered adversely. Consequently, it was conveyed to the Prime Minister that the anxiety which the Delegation felt was lest the Conference should suddenly collapse without their having been able to comply with the Cabinet instruction, and that, apart from this, none of the Delegates were anxious at the moment for personal consultation. It is understood that this information&apos; met the Prime Minister on his arrival in London on Saturday evening. Such members of the Cabinet as could be assembled met and sent the telegram in Appendix VII, suggesting that if a substantial offer, say, 70 to 80 per cent, were met, the country would accept it, but leaving the decision in the last resort to the Delegation, with the request that if the worst came they should make it clear that the responsibility was not theirs, owing to the unquestioned unfairness of the Report.   To this the Delegation sent the following reply : &quot; We are most grateful for the Cabinets support of our attitude and for leaving the final decision to us. We will, of course, bear the views of our colleagues carefully in mind.&quot;60. On the night of Saturday, the 24th August, the note of the other Creditor Powers, as already mentioned, was still incomplete. Through journalistic sources information-poured in, to the effect that the offer was to be very favourable to us. On calling at the Belgian Delegation Sir Maurice Hankey was also given an optimistic view of the prospects.61. On Sunday, however, the position seems to have changed, and this was probably due to an entirely unfounded report from England in the Dutch newspapers that the Prime Minister was on his way to The Hague. Although the story was at once denied officially, and pains were taken to ensure that M. Jaspar, who presided over the meetings of the other Inviting Powers, was under no illusions on the subject, it is difficult to believe that it did not affect the tone of the reply. A member of the British Delegation was informed that the draft which had been prepared on Saturday night was rewritten on Sunday morning, and, as already mentioned, it was not completed until late on Sunday night, nor delivered until 8 a.m. on the morning of Monday, the 26th August. Another factor which may have contributed to a change in attitude of the Creditor Powers was an article in the &quot; Observer &quot; (all copies of which at The Hague were eagerly bought up), advocating a settlement on conciliatory lines. These factors are mentioned merely to show the extraordinarily sensitive condition at which the Conference had arrived. The other Creditor Powers had never quite got out of their heads the idea that the British Delegates w^ere &quot; bluffing,&quot; and snatched at every strawr to confirm their belief.62. The long time which had been occupied by the other Creditor Powers in preparing this new final offer had led, not unreasonably, to the expectation that it would at least make some substantial advance on the previous offer which had been communicated verbally, even if it did not afford a basis for the final discussion of a settlement. It was somewhat of an anti-climax, therefore, to find that the new offer, a copy of which is attached in Appendix VIII,&apos;was merely a repetition of the previous offer which was attached to Part I of this Report, and that it only purported to offer us 60 per cent, of our demand in regard to the distribution of annuities.63. After the note had been translated and subjected to expert examination, the British Delegates met and agreed to send the following reply, which was delivered to M. Jaspar at about 2p.m..: &quot; Dear M. Jaspar, &quot; August 26, 1929.We have received your communication of the 25th August, conveying tous the reply to my letter of the 23rd August, in Avhich I asked for a definite
statement in writing of the final proposals which the other Creditor Powers were prepared to make.The British Delegation have considered your Memorandum, and they note with regret that it shows no appreciable advance upon your previous offer, and is altogether inadequate.Yours sincerely, (Sd.) Philip Snowben.&quot;64. In conversations with Sir Maurice Hankey, as Secretary-General, M. Jaspar more than once expressed some reproach for the brevity of this reply and the rapidity with which it had been despatched after so long an effort on their part. Sir Maurice Hankey, however, pointed out to M. Jaspar that insomuch as his reply did not contain, and indeed did not purport to contain, any offer beyond those which had already been made verbally and rejected, there had seemed no object either in spending longer over it or in writing a reasoned reply. Time was passing rapidly. Experience had shown that long notes required long answers. M. Jaspar&apos;s note had occupied more than two days to prepare. The preparation by the British Delegates of an equally long reasoned reply would have taken at least another day, and the rejoinder to that might again have occupied two days, without any progress being made. It seemed in the interests of the Conference as a whole to send a short reply and at once. Moreover, if M. Jaspar had any feelings on the matter he ought to remember that the British Delegation also had feelings. They really had expected some advance after the long deliberations of the other Creditor Powers, and merely to repeat the previous offer had obviously not been particularly congenial to the British Delegation. M. Jaspar admitted the truth of this last statement.65. An interesting sequel to the receipt of the offer of Monday, the 26th August, was a call from Mr. Adatci, the Head of the Japanese Delegation, who came to explain to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that they had attended the discussions of the other Creditor Powers as an observer and had offered their advice, but that they did not take part in sending the Memorandum and did not associate themselves with it. He had explained this to the representatives of the other Powers and had obtained their consent to his making this declaration to the British Government as a matter of loyalty. Mr. Adatci further explained that, in order to assist towards a settlement, the Japanese Delegation had agreed to repay the 7,769,000 gold marks R.M. which they received during the last five months of the Dawes annuities. On the other hand, they had obtained an assurance from the other Delegations that Japan should be allowed as compensation 3,300,000 marks a year out of the unconditional annuities. In the evening Mr. Adatci called again to say he had heard that the French Council of Ministers had decided unanimously that the proposals put forward in the last Memorandum represented the last -word so far as France was concerned. It w;as emphasised that a large element of public opinion in France considered that the offer made already went too far. He was very upset at the idea of a breakdown, and suggested that if there was any hope that the British Delegation would be satisfied with 65 per cent, or 70 per cent, of their requirements he believed that he would be able to secure additional proposals up to such an amount. The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that he would not be able to accept a settlement on such a basis and was unwilling to commit himself to a figure that he would accept. Mr. Graham, who had arrived, agreed with the Chancellors views.66. Another episode in connection with the note of the other Creditor Powers is perhaps worth mentioning, since it is characteristic of what was happening throughout this Conference. M. Jaspar summoned Sir Maurice Hankey, as Secretary-General, shortly after 11 o&apos;clock, and received him in company with the French and Italian Delegates. They then asked that details of the new note should not be published. They thought it would be very disastrous if the details leaked om, and would render any &quot;further progress in the Conference impossible. Sir Maurice Hankey recalled a number of cases in which leakages had occurred during the present Conference, and asked whether this undertaking was really to be kept. They all insisted that that was the intention, and Sir Maurice Hankey undertook to report it to the British Delegates, who eventually accepted it. An hour or two after, however, British journalists informed Mr. Steward, of the Press Section, of many details of the proposal, including even the figures, wdiich they said they had derived from their French colleagues.   A late edition of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of that date, which
arrived later in the day, showed that the information had been extracted by the journalists1 from Experts who left the Binnenhof late on Sunday evening. The whole of the details had been given away before the note or any information in regard to it had reached the British Delegation, and twelve hours before the proposed ban of secrecy. In the circumstances Mr. Snowden sent Sir Maurice Hankey to M. Jaspar to say that it was unavoidable to give some details, but that the note would not be published in extenso.. M. Jaspar asked that at any rate commentary should be restricted in such a way as not to indicate that the Conference was about to break down, and Mr. SnowTden in fact gave the most careful instructions to the Head of the Press Section, who carried out his duties in a way with which M. Jaspar afterwards expressed satisfaction.67. On the morning of Tuesday, the 27th August, the deadlock was again complete. Substantial progress, it is true, had been made on the political side, the agreement in regard to which was almost complete provided a settlement could be reached on the financial side. In the matter of Deliveries in Kind also some progress had been made, though our requirements had not been completely met (Appendix IX). Oh the financial side, however, the position was almost the same as it had been three weeks before, when Mr. Snowden made his first speech. Nothing approaching an adequate advance had been made towards the British point of view on the matter of the distribution of the annuities. The other Creditor Powers had insisted on the integral maintenance of the Young Report, and outside of that Report they had found it impossible to compensate us for the loss of the Spa percentages applied to the total payments.68. In these circumstances the British Delegation, after an early meeting, decided to despatch Sir Maurice Hankey to M. Jaspar to ask for the summoning of the Six Inviting Powers at 3 p.m. the same afternoon, and for a meeting of the Plenary Conference on the following morning at 10 a.m., so as to enable Mr. Henderson to leave in time for the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva. Sir Maurice Hankey delivered this message at 11-15 a.m. He found that the French, Belgian and Italian Delegations had just made a request for a meeting of the Six Inviting Powers. No other Delegation had asked for a Plenary, for which Sir Maurice Hankey was obliged to press. Later on the meeting of the Six Inviting Powers was fixed for 5 p.m., and as regards the Plenary, M. Jaspar had said he was not competent to summon it, and that the matter should be raised at the 5 o&apos;clock meeting. It was reported from Rotterdam that the French Delegation had booked the whole of a Wagon-Lits for the same evening.69. The Meeting of the Six Inviting Powers took place in a Committee Room of the First Chamber of the States-General at 5 p.m. Each Delegation outlined its own point of view at some length. By arrangement, no formal record was kept of any of these meetings, although the&apos; Secretary-General was present and kept a fairly full private note, which is on record. The other Delegations had their interpreters&apos; notes. For a long time it looked as though a breakdown of the Conference was inevitable.70. At this meeting Mr. Snowden made the British Delegation^ position very clear, as is shown by the following extract from Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s notes : &quot; M. Briand had said that so long as conciliatory measures were likely to be fruitful he had been willing to continue. That was precisely the British Delegation^ attitude. They had, however, now wraited for three weeks. There had been no progress, no decision. That was a most regrettable thing. The British Delegation also had been throughout most anxious to give an opportunity for conversations which would be fruitful in their result. He thought that all the Delegates would agree that the British Delegation had been very patient. For days they had had to sit idle during continuous meetings of the other Creditor Powers. On the previous Friday, after conversations he had had with M. Jaspar and M. Francqui, who had submitted certain proposals to him, he had asked the other Creditor Powers to put their final offer in writing, and had expressed a hope that a substantial advance would be made and that this would provide the means to end discussion and enable progress to be made. M. Jaspar had received that letter on Saturday morning, and had replied that Mr. Snowden should be in possession of the final reply by 4 p.m.*   No reply had come on* M. Jaspar afterwards explained, however, that he had stated that he could not give an absolute guarantee of this.&apos;
Saturday afternoon. All day Sunday they had waited, and no reply had come untilMonday morning. He hoped his remark would not be regarded as offensive if he said that it seemed to the British Delegation incredible that to draft a short memorandum containing no advance on the Jaspar-Francqui offer should take so long. An hour should have been sufficient. He recalled once more that he had asked for a final offer and a substantial advance. It came, and, as the &apos; Times &apos; said to-day, it was incredible, in view of what had happened. He took the reply to his letter to which he had just referred as a final offer. As regards the hoped-for substantial advance, it was an expectation which had not been fulfilled. If that was the final offer, then there was nothing more to be said. The British Delegation had sent their&apos; reply yesterday, pointing out that the offer was wholly unsatisfactory and could not be regarded as acceptable. There matters stood at the moment.....&quot;Mr. Henderson supported Mr. Snowden strongly, as shown by the following quotation from Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s notes : &quot; Mr. Henderson said that even if they passed by the question whether the letter had been promised by a certain hour, he would like to ask why the British &apos; Delegation had had to wait the whole of Saturday and Sunday. It was only on Monday that the Note was received. Even when it was received it was only to find (and this was a very important point indeed) that it contained an offer of 60 per. cent, of the British demand, which was no more than the previousoffer.....Mr. Henderson said that in the Note itself there was an admission that the offers of the 22nd August and the 25th August were practically the same. He asked whether that was admitted. He was in a position to prove it. Referring to the Note itself, he pointed out that the following passage occurred on page 1 : &quot; &apos; Inspired by the same motive we increased the offer of the 22nd August to a sum which amounted within a few thousand marks to 28,600,000 marks, a sum equivalent to 60 per cent, of the British demand.&apos;&quot;A little later on the fresh proposal was stated to be 60 per cent, of the British claims. In other words, the Note itself admitted that no advance had been made on the question of distribution of annuities. He asked definitely whether this offer of 60 per cent, was the last offer that could be made to the British Delegation.&quot;71. It is unnecessary in this summary to give in detail the arguments and excuses with which the British case was met. Perhaps the strongest argument used was one put forward and reiterated by M. Briand that the British Delegation had never given any answer to the proposals of the other Creditor Powers : &apos;&apos; Every bargain was in the nature of a dialogue one who offered and one who discussed.   There should be an answer to the one who made an offer.   Upto now, however, in this Conference, there had been only one voice, that of theone who offered.This was neatly countered by Mr. Snowden : &apos;&apos; Great Britain had made no demand at all.   All she asked was that theother countries should not take away something which belonged to her.....Ifwe were to consider the case of a debtor and a creditor, no creditor would take less than he knew a debtor was in a position to pay. Remission was only admissible when the capacity to pay was in doubt.&quot;Another argument used by M. Briand and others was in reply to Mr. Snowden&apos;s contention that the sanctity of international agreements was at stake. They pointed out that since the war many agreements had been altered, sometimes to the detriment of France or Italy, but in these cases the sacrifice had been accepted in the major interests of peace and settlement. That was all that was asked on the present occasion. Mr. Snowden was able to show the inconsistency of this claim with the oft-repeated demand that the report, being indivisible, must be accepted as a whole. The report involved a breach of international agreements which Great Britain would not accept, unless she was recouped outside the report for the heavy losses this breach of agreements involved. For this no acceptable compensation had been proposed.
72. Towards what appeared to be the end of the meeting, with a threatened breakdown of the Conference, Mr. Henderson again intervened and pressed strongly his demand to know whether the 60 per cent, really was the last offer.73. This led to an adjournment &quot;for ten minutes to air the room.&quot; The ten minutes, in fact, were spun out to four or five hours, during which a bargaining process set in. The British Delegates remained in the Conference Room and the other Creditor Powers sat in another room. M. Jaspar acted as an intermediary. During the formal meeting the other Creditor Powers had emphasised very strongly the point that, although they had advanced to 60 per cent., there had been absolutely no indication by the British Delegation of what they could accept. This was a point which M. Jaspar, the intermediary, pressed. The bargaining began by Mr. Snowden pointing out that M. Briand had more than once admitted the justice of the British case, and that it was therefore for the other Creditor Powers to make a further approach towards the British position and say exactly what their maximum was. If their maximum approached to any minimum which the British Delegation might have in mind, they would examine whether the gap could be bridged. But if the gap was still large there was nothing to be done. M. Jaspar returned within five minutes to say that at first his friends would only advance to 66 per cent., but he had declined to return to the British Delegation without offering 70 per cent., which he had achieved. Mr. Snowden at once rejected this. There were long silences, interspersed with short interjected remarks, and conference (with many calculations) between the British Delegates. But at about 8-45 p.m. Mr. Snowden made the following offer : (1.) Annuities of 28.,000,000 marks to be raised to 40,000,000 marks.(2.) Some further concession on unconditional annuities.(3.) Coal orders from Italy, 1,500,000 tons as a minimum.(4.) Bank to be situated in London.(5.) Existing concessions to be confirmed.In half an hour&apos;s time M. Jaspar returned with the following counter-offer :  On Point 1.   35,000,000 marks as compared with the British demand of 40,000,000 marks.On Point 2.   Nothing could be done owing to the difficulties with the smaller Powers.On Point 3.   Italy had been persuaded to advance to 700,000 tons of coal. On Point 4.   They were not willing to discuss the Bank. On Point 5.   Acceptance.This proposal was not acceptable, and at 9-55 M. Jaspar withdrew again to consult the other Creditor Powers. He returned in a quarter of an hour to say that Belgium would put up 1,000,000 marks, raising the total on Point 1 to 36,000,000 marks. Italy had declined to make any advance on coal, but he thought that if agreement were reached on the other points Italy could be screwed up to 1,000,000 tons as a maximum. It was felt that perhaps M. Pirelli might do something, as Italy had so far,made comparatively little contribution to the offer of the other Creditor Powers. M. Pirelli, however, thought he was only asked to discuss coal, and when other questions were raised he abruptly left the room. At 11-35 the following proposal was handed to M. Jaspar : (1.) A proposal by Mr. Leith-Ross as to the dates of the payments to Great Britain which would result in an advantage to Great Britain equivalent on 5  per cent. Tables to about 4,000,000 marks a year for 37 years, which had been explained to M. Jaspar.(2.) Unconditional. 60,000,000 marks in all to be secured through rearranging the annual amounts of the unconditional annuity without increasing the total.(3.) 1,000,000 tons of coal yearly, firm contract for 3 years, at the best Britishprice, for Italian State Railways. (4.) The question of the Bank for London to be reserved. The previous Point 5 already accepted.M. Jaspar returned a few minutes later and said his friends would accept the Leith-Ross proposal. A little more bargaining in regard to coal led to a promise of the purchase of 1,000,000 tons by Italy for three years under conditions insisted on
by Mr. Graham, namely, the purchase not as hitherto.proposed at the market price f.o.b. at Rotterdam, but at a genuine market price at British ports.74. All this time the Delegates had had to content themselves with a few sandwiches for their dinner, and the German Delegates, who were not a party to these bargainings, had withdrawn. At midnight they were asked by telephone to return, and there was what seemed an interminable wait. At last they arrived, but without Dr. Stresemann, whose doctor had refused to allow him to leave his bed. For certain parts of tKe bargain the consent of the German Delegation was necessary. When the meeting reassembled at 1 a.m. the German Delegates asked for an adjourn-ment in order that the matter might be discussed on the following day in Dr. Stresemann&apos;s presence. They also asked for the Heads of Agreement reached, in order that they might understand the position. This was drafted hastily and in general terms by Mr. Waley, of the Treasury Section, and handed unofficially to the German Delegation at about 2-30 a.m. by Sir Maurice Hankey.   (Appendix X.)75. On the following day, Wednesday, the 28th August, the Delegates of the Six Inviting Powers met again at 11 a.m. to discuss matters with the Germans, who offered a strong resistance to the proposal that they should be asked to abandon their claim to the surplus on the last five months of the Dawes Loan, and to the proposals in regard to the unconditional annuity unless the question of the cost of the Armies of Occupation was settled simultaneously. At the afternoon session at 3 p.m., again; little progress was made. The German Delegation proved extremely stubborn. About 7-15 p.m. the meeting had to be adjourned, as there was a Dinner to be given that night to the principal Delegations by the British Delegation at the Grand Hotel, Scheveningen. After the Dinner, at about 11 p.m. the subject was again resumed. Dr. Wirth then made a proposal which he had worked out since the last meeting, under which he proposed the creation of a common pool to cover the cost of the Armies of Occupation prior to the evacuation. To this pool Germany would subscribe f, and the Allied Powers the remaining -f. Estimating the figure for the pool for the moment at 80,000,000 marks, he proposed that Germany should contribute 30,000,000 and the Occupying Powers 50,000,000. If in practice, however, the cost should be less than 80,000,000, Germany would not make any claim on the balance. He thought, however, that the cost in fact would be less than 80,000,000 marks, and perhaps only 60,000,000. In that event Germany would subscribe two-thirds to the pool under the same conditions. In addition, Germany was to waive all out-standing and future claims for services and damages to property and was to accept surrender of all claims to the surplus on the last five months of the Dawes Plan, as well as the arrangement as regards unconditional annuities. There was a prolonged discussion on this subject, in the course of which the French reiterated the view they had expressed again and again during earlier meetings, that Germany ought to pay the whole, and had insisted in these circumstances that, even if, in the desire for conciliation, the proposal were accepted, Germany ought to pay not less than 50 per cent. To this the German Delegation would not assent. Various means were sought for overcoming the difficulty, but at 2 a.m. on the morning of the 29th August agreement had not been reached. There is little doubt that the German Delegates were awaiting a telegram from Berlin and had. to play for time.76. The morning of Thursday, the 29th August, had been allotted to the winding up of the affairs of the Political Commission. In view, however, of the difficulties which the Germans had raised in regard to the concessions asked of them and the deadlock which had arisen on the subject of the Armies of Occupation, some small anxiety was felt as to whether the Political Commission would have such a smooth passage as its Chairman, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was justified in expecting after his long work of preparation. Any adverse anticipations on the subject, however, were removed by the event, for the work of the Political Commission, which is dealt with in a separate part of this report, was completed amid general congratulations. Owing to the interdependence of the two branches of the work of the Conference, we surmised that this success on the political side could not have been achieved unless the difficulties raised by the Germans in the Financial Commission, which had occupied the meeting of the Six Inviting PoAvers the whole of the previous day, had not been in process of solution.77. This anticipation proved correct. At a meeting of the Six Inviting Powers held that afternoon (Thursday, the 29th August) all the outstanding difficulties with
the Germans were cleared up. As regards the cost of the Armies of Occupation, a pool of 60 million marks was to be created in accordance with Dr. Wirth&apos;s plan. Towards this the Germans were to pay a lump sum of 30 million marks once and for all. The rest of the pool was to .be supplied by the other Occupying Powers* in the following proportions :- per cent;France       ... ... ... ... ...      35Great Britain ... ... ... ...      12Belgium     ... ... ... ... ...        3The Germans agreed to all the requests that had been made to them. The Occupying Powers and the German Government agreed reciprocally to abandon all their claims relating to damages and all present or future credits in regard to services and damages.78. The German Delegation, in return for these concessions, made a special plea that the utmost care should be taken to avoid serious damage being done in the last days of the occupation, which was, of course, agreed to, the point being provided for in the Notes exchanged between the Occupying Powers and the German Delega-tion on the subject.79. At this point, when everything appeared settled, two incidents, characteristic of international Conferences, occurred. First, a last-hour claim by the Belgian Delegation to escape from the undertaking which France, following Great Britain&apos;s example, had accepted, to waive all claims against Germany in matters relating to the Armies of Occupation. The claim was made on the ground that Belgian advances to Germany on account of damages exceeded the amounts spent and that the balance would accrue to Germany. Under pressure from Mr. Snowden, however, this claim was withdrawn.80. At this moment, when everything appeared to be settled, Mr. Adatci, the Japanese Delegate, raised the question of German claims in regard to a telegraph cable in the Pacific, and the Shantung Railway, insisting that they should now be renounced. He said he had received instructions from Tokyo that such a renunciation was to be a condition of acceptance by Japan of the Young Report. Dr. Stresemann refused to discuss the question, of which he had never heard, and on which he was totally uninformed. Eventually Mr. Adatci agreed that the matter should be dealt with by a Committee which, he understood, would be set up under the Young Plan for wiping out the past. These last-moment claims wasted time which could ill be spared, for evening had already come and it had not been possible to set the drafting Committees to work.81. These delays recoiled on the final stages of the Conference. The Drafting Committees, composed of numerous experts of six nations, starting their work towards 8 o&apos;clock in the evening and continuing far into the night, produced results which, as could only have been expected, came in for criticism next day.82. The next morning, Friday, the 30th August, so far as outward progress on the financial side was concerned, was entirely lost, owing to the decision of the six Inviting Powers to. stage a ceremony for the signature of the various Notes arising out of the Political Commission. The French raised difficulties at the last moment, in regard to the inclusion in the draft final Protocol prepared by the Jurists of the results of the work of the Political Commission, which, M. Briand maintained concerned only the Inviting and not the Invited Powers. The whole arrangement had to be re-edited. The ceremony of the signature had to be postponed for an hour or twro while fresh drafts were prepared, with the result that the meeting of the Financial Commission arranged for 11 a.m. had to be deferred until 3 o&apos;clock in the afternoon. Nevertheless good use was made of the enforced interval to come to terms with those of the Invited Powers, whose consent was necessary to the agreement already reached between the Inviting Powers. This involved, inter alia, a renunciation by Great Britain of 5 million Marks ( 250,000) for the benefit of Japan, Portugal and Jugo-Slavia a small matter in comparison with the political and financial gains to this country resulting from the British Delegates&apos; firm stand.. * By a side-agreement between the Belgian, British arid French Delegations it was arranged that Great Britain and Belgium would pay their own Army costs and neither contribute to, nor receive anything from, the pool.
83. When, in the afternoon of Friday, the 30th August, the Financial Committee did at last meet, it was in a thoroughly bad atmosphere. Many of the Delegates were irritated at the delays, and through a series of misunderstandings arising out of the scrapping of the first draft of the Jurists&apos; final Protocol, the meeting was conducted on the basis of a series of resolutions proposed from the Chair and &quot;not on the Jurists&apos; draft. Owing to the delay in settling with the Invited Powers it had not been possible to circulate these resolutions beforehand, and owing to congestion in the French half of the Secretariat-General, they were laid on the table in the English language only. This bred suspicion and increased the prevailing irritation. Eventually, however, agreement was reached on all points but one namely, the question of a Committee to consider the liquidation of the past.84. It would be merely tedious to follow the Conference in detail through its final stages : the late sessions of the Financial Committee and Drafting Committee (who accomplished splendid work under the direction of Sir Cecil Hurst) : the all-night work of the Secretariat-General. It is sufficient to record that on the morning of Saturday, the 31st August, the Financial Commission met at 10 a.m. and completed its business. The final Protocol is being circulated separately. It is perhaps worthy of mention that towards the&apos; end of the meeting, when everything appeared settled, the German Delegation put in a demand that the final documents of the Conference should be produced in German as well as in French and English, and it was only after eloquent pleas from their colleagues that the request was withdrawn. The Plenary Meeting followed an hour later, that is to say, as soon as the documents could be got into final shape by the Drafting Committee and the Secretariat-General. One interesting episode occurred in regard to the Presidency. In the early days of the Conference it had been decided that the Presidency should fall to the Heads of Delegations of the Inviting Powers in rotation according to alphabetical order in French. It fell to Dr. Stresemann, as the representative of &quot; Allemagne,&quot; to take the Chair on this occasion. Dr. Stresemann, after taking the Chair, in a happy speech, relinquished it to M. Jaspar, who had carried out the work of President up to now with such conspicuous tact and success. A little later in the meeting, after the final Protocol had been adopted, Mr. Snowden pointed out that the Protocol devolved certain duties upon the President of the Conference. He proposed, therefore, that M. Jaspar should remain as permanent President, which was adopted with acclamation.85. Owing to the delays in reaching agreements, and the technical difficulties in getting them into shape in the middle watches of the night the last of a series of late nights for all concerned the last stage of the Conference had to be hurried. Half the delegates had to leave for Geneva at 1 p.m. There was no time for an open public ceremony in the presence of the press and the Diplomatic Corps, nor for the long and eloquent speeches which might have been expected on such a historic occasion. Nevertheless, if these orations were brief and comparatively few, they rang true, and the final ceremony was not devoid of dignity. It happened to be the birthday of the Queen of the Netherlands. As the final documents were signed (as prescribed by the Jurists&apos; Committee) by the President and the Secretary-General, the only sound that broke the silence was the strains of a band in the stately Square of the Binnenhof playing the well-known hymn, &quot;Now thank we all our God.&quot;The Binnenhof. The Hague, August 31, 1929.Appendices I to IY are printed in Part I of this Document, CP. 238 (29).
Letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to M. Jaspar, dated August 23, 1929. Dear Mr. Jaspar,I AM gravely disappointed with the slow progress that has been made towards a definite conclusion upon the matters in dispute between ourselves and the other Creditor Powers. It was intended when these questions were handed over to the Heads of the Delegations more than a week ago that they would come to a very early decision. After the meeting of the Heads of the Delegations yesterday morning it was clearly understood that within a few hours I should receive the final offer of the other Creditor Powers. The verbal report which was given to me late last night by M. Francqui and yourself carried us very little, if any, further. Your proposals in regard to the distribution of the annuities were merely a repetition of what had been previously suggested by the other Creditor Powers, with two exceptions. First, the sum which it was suggested should come to us from the undistributed surplus had been reduced from the  12^ millions indicated by M. Loucheur on Tuesday evening to  10 millions; and secondly, the Italian offer of  350,000 a year was now to be guaranteed. On the question of the allocation of the unconditional part of the annuities you had made no advance and had nothing definite to offer. So it was in regard to deliveries in kind. On these, as on the other points, your proposals were quite inadequate. I have since, at your suggestion, seen the German Ministers and I have been somewhat astonished to learn that they have been given to understand by the representatives of the other Creditor PoAvers that we desire Germany to undertake additional obligations in order to- assist in making good the losses imposed upon us by the Young Plan. There is, of course, no foundation for this suggestion. I have from the outset made it clear that the British Government are prepared to accept the assessment of the German annuities proposed by the Experts. What I require is that these annuities, whatever they may be, should be distributed between the Creditor Governments in accordance with existing agreements. This seems to me a just and reasonable request which should have been accepted without question. If the other Creditor Governments are unwilling to modify the distribution proposed in the Plan so as to bring it into conformity with existing agreements, I am willing to consider any alternative proposals which they may wish to formulate for making-good our losses; but it must be clearly understood that the responsibility for any such proposals must rest with the other Creditor Powers, and that they must under -take to discharge all claims, whether on the part of Germany or on the part of other Creditor Governments, affecting the sums which they offer to us. This applies equally to any proposals relating to the distribution of the total annuities, or to the unconditional annuities, or to the allocation of the &quot; surplus &quot; during the past five months.The misconceptions which appear to have been aroused on this point make it desirable that I should have a definite statement, in writing, of the final proposals which the other Creditor Powers are prepared to make in order to meet my views and which I hope will represent a substantial advance beyond those which you outlined last night. I would ask you to let me have this statement before the meeting arranged for to-morrow afternoon, as in the absence of a definite document I fear that no useful object is likely to be secured by having that meeting.Yours sincerely, (Signed) PHILIP SNOWDEN.His Excellency M. Jaspar.
Cher M. Snowden, La Haye, le 24 A out 1929.SIE MAURICE HANKEY m&apos;a apporte il y a quelques instants la lettre datee d&apos;hier que vous m&apos;adressez.Je vais en donner connaissance sans retard aux chefs de delegation des autres Puissances cr^anieres et 1&apos;examiner avec eux.Cette lettre fait apparaitre divers malentendus que, dans un interet commun, nous desirons vivement dissiper. D&apos;autre part, la reponse 6crite que je vous enverrai doit etre 1&apos;objet d&apos;une deliberation entre les delegues des autres Puissances creancieres. Je m&apos;emploierai a vous la faire tenir le plus tot possible, sans pouvoir toutefois vous garantir, etant donne le peu de temps qui m&apos;est laisse, qu&apos;elle vous sera remise avant 4 h. de 1&apos;apres-midi.Votre devoue,HENRI JASPAR.The Right Hon. Philip Snowden, Chancelier de 1&apos;Echiquier, La Haye.APPENDIX VII.Telegram No. 11 W. from Prime Minister to Mr. Snowden, August 24, 1929, 10-45 p.m.A MEETING of six Ministers with the Prime Minister present was held, and they had under consideration, in the knowledge that they had, the situation in The Hague.   They are very delighted with the stand which has been made for the vindication of the claims of this country to fair treatment, which she does not receive under the Experts&apos; Report.   It is necessary for us to consider now the full effect of any action taken in The Hague.  The meeting is of opinion that, if a substantial offer were met, say, 70 to 80 per cent, of our claim, the country would accept it, because, in the first place, we have made a stand, which will avoid repetition of that which we had to fight; and, secondly, it would avoid the unknown but certainly troublesome repercussions, political and financial, that would follow a complete breakdown.   It would be necessary, however, to make the suggestion after the other Creditor Powers had said their last word to us, and should be included in the reply to that last word.  This could be done by referring to the swollen estimates made by the Creditor Powrers, and by saying that if they in reality gave that which they say they are giving, a settlement would be possible.   Or something to that effect.   The opinion of the meeting is that, with that expression of their views, they leave the decision in regard to the last word to the Delegation, with the further request that if the worst comes the Delegation should make it clear that the responsibility is not theirs, owing to the fact that the unfairness in the Report towards us is without question.&quot;198481
Translation of Letters from M. Jaspar to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,dated August 25, 1929.Covering Memorandum.Dear Mr. Snowden, The Hague, August 25, 1929.I HAVE the honour to transmit to you, in the form of a memorandum annexed hereto, the reply promised by my letter of yesterday.It is necessary, in the first place, to lay special emphasis on the fact that, contrary to what you have apparently understood, the German Delegation have never been &quot; given to understand that you desire Germany to undertake additional obligations, in order to assist in making good the losses imposed on you by the Young Plan.&quot;The explanations set out in the annexed memorandum will serve to clear up the misunderstandings which have arisen, and you will certainly realise that the offer made, which has undoubtedly been under-estimated because of these misunder-standings, is a much better offer than you believed at first.Apart from the additional financial and economic advantages accruing to Great Britain, the offer amounts, in fact, to 60 per cent, of the figure indicated by you.In the light of this explanation you will appreciate that this offer constitutes a proof of the desire for conciliation by which it was inspired, and you will, I am sure, desire to reply to it in the same spirit.Yours sincerely, (Signed) HENRI JASPAR.Memorandum.(Translation.)The claims of the British Delegation concerned three points : 1. The share in the annuity allocated to Great Britain. 2. The Unconditional Annuities. 3. The system of Deliveries in Kind.1. The Share of the Annuity allocated to Great Britain.The British Delegates had asked for an increase in their share of the Annuities amounting to 48 million marks during 37 years, to include the annuity corresponding to the sum of about 100 million marks allocated to Great Britain by Article 192 of the Annexes to the Young Plan.While making the fullest reserves, both as regards the amount of this demand and as to the reasons for which the British Delegation held it to be justified, we have endeavoured to take it into account to the fullest possible extent in the over-riding interest of Peace, which holds the foremost place in the minds of all. For this reason, a first offer was made&apos;at the outset within the framework of the Young Plan and without involving any departure from it, which corresponded to 21,600,000 marks a year, or 45 per cent, of the demand put forward.Inspired by the same motive, we increased the offer on the 22nd August to a sum which amounted within a few thousand marks to 28,600,000 marks a sum equivalent to 60 per cent, of the British demand.These figures take no account of the special advantages of a financial or economic character which accrue to the benefit of Great Britain.There can thus be no doubt that an ever increasing effort has been made to satisfy the British Delegation to the fullest possible extent.^ ^ ^ &quot;Jf? *Jv- &quot;ft&quot;As we informed the British Delegation at the start and reaffirmed later, the only means whereby it has been or can be possible to put forward the offers made is by
The annuity of 28,600,000 marks referred to above is made up of the following items :  &apos;Marks.(a.) There will be transferred to Great Britain in accordance with the Young Plan (Article 192 of the Annexes) a sum of approximately 100,000,000 &apos; marks, corresponding to an annuity of 7,200,000 marks during 37 years     ... ...      7,200,000&apos; (b.) As it has not been possible to reach agreement with the British Delegation on the rate of interest to be used in translating into annuities the capital sums available in respect of the last five months of the Dawes Plan, the offer which follows is made in the form of annuities, as the British Delegation have demanded from the outset as regards the whole of their claim. *On the other hand, the Powers which will guarantee the payment of the annuity referred to in the present paragraph will themselves retain the whole of the sums which are or may be available from the last five months of the Dawes Plan.Upon these terms the offer is made, subject to the German Government desisting from their claim, of a fixed annual sum during 37 years of 14,400,000 marks ...     14,400,000(c.) Italy applies in favour of Great Britain a part of the claims to which she is entitled under the Agreements of the 10th September, 1919, and the 8th December, 1919, in regard to the costs of Liberation and the ceded properties.Italy is thereby enabled to guarantee to Great Britain unreservedly during 37 years an annuity of 7,000,000 marks      7,000,000These various amounts make up the total of 28,600,000 marks referred to above, or 60 per cent, of the British claims   &quot;   ... ... ... ... ... ...    28,600,0002. Unconditional Annuities.Great Britain will be in the position of receiving unconditional annuities amounting to 88,600,000 marks, either as the result of the Young Plan or as the result of the offers made above and those made below. This amount of 88,600,000 marks is made up as follows : Marks.(a.) 18,000,000 marks out of the amount of about 28,000,000 marks left available from the unconditional annuities (the balance of 10 millions requiring to be reserved for other Creditor Powers)     ... ... ... ... ... ...     18,000,000(&amp;.) The 28,600,000 marks detailed above, which have an uncon-ditional value in virtue of their being guaranteed ...     28,600,000(c.) The arithmetical average of the amount of the annuities which will be set free by the progressive reduction of the sums required for the service of the Dawes Loan, in accord-ance with proposals submitted to the German Delegation (these proposals, which are known to the British Delegation, involve no increase in Germany&apos;s obligations)    ... ...     42,000,00086,600,000having resort in the first place to the amounts which, under the Dawes Plan, accrue to certain Creditor Powers other than Great Britain for the period from April to September 1929.Germany, it is known, puts forward a claim to these amounts; the Creditor Powers which hold these sums to meet their requirements have formally contested this claim and continue to do so.It has, been stated to the British Delegation that it was necessary as a preliminary step to obtain from Germany the renunciation of these wholly un justifiable claims.
3. Deliveries in Kind.In accordance with the arrangements made, the President of the Board of Trade has conferred with the Delegates of the five other Powers, and very considerable results have thereby been achieved in the direction of safeguarding British economic interests.An aide-memoire, setting out the results of these discussions, has been drawn up, and is in the hands of the British Delegation.4. Special Advantages.As regards the special advantages referred to at the beginning of this Note, the following only will be mentioned here : (i.) The release given by the Young Plan to the British Empire (and not only to Great Britain) in regard to the surplus resulting from the liquidation of ex-German properties. This surplus has been estimated by the British Treasury experts themselves, as regards Great Britain alone, at an amount of  10 to  14 million.It is certain that, even if allowance is made for the counter-claims mentioned by the British Treasury experts, the surplus will be of considerable importance.(ii.) The substantial and progressive reduction of deliveries in kind provided for by the Young Plan, together with the complementary guarantees referred to above. These modifications of the existing system of deliveries in kind have been established almost exclusively in favour of British trade.(iii.) The advantage which results for Great Britain from the assimilation of sums received under the Reparation Recovery Act procedure to deliveries in kind.(iv.) The offers made by Italy on the subject of the import of coal, (v.) The averages indirectly resulting to Great Britain from the concessions made by France and Italy to certain Powers with minor interests, in order to obtain their adherence to the Young Plan.APPENDIX IX.Deliveries in Kind. Aide-Memoir e.AFTER an exchange of views between the representatives of the various Delegations, the Sub-Committee entrusted with the study of questions concerning. Deliveries in Kind have come to the conclusion that, subject to there being general agreement on the whole question of Reparations, it might be possible to reach an agreement on the following points raised by the British Delegation : 1. A Committee should be set up by the Governments in -accordance with article 138 of the Young plan for the purpose of drafting new regulations for Deliveries in Kind. 2. The provisions of these regulations should be binding on the Bank for international  Settlements and could only be revised by agreementbetween the Governments concerned. 3. The principle of the Wallenburg Regulations concerning the prohibition tore-export goods received as Deliveries in Kind should be maintainedunder the Young plan. 4. It is not necessary to adopt under the new regulations any measures whichwould permit the various Powers to dispose of a part of their share inDeliveries in Kind outside their own territories in the manner providedfor in article 139 of the Young plan.
Note No. II.With a view to safeguarding the financial, commercial and economic interests of the several signatory Governments, the following procedure shall be applied to the special programmes for Deliveries in Kind : (a.) In the case of any such special programme involving an extension in any of the first ten years of the Plan of the programme of Deliveries in Kind laid down in the Plan for that year;(&amp;.) In the case of any special programme after the first ten years.These special programmes shall be submitted for approval to a Committee which shall be convened by the Bank for International Settlements and on which each of the signatory Governments may have a representative. This Committee shall take decisions by a majority vote. If a member of the Committee considers that the interests of his Government, as defined above, are prejudiced by the decision of the Committee, he may refer the decision to the arbitrator provided for hereafter, on condition that he furnish the arbitrator with a reasoned statement of his objections within a maximum period of seven days. The arbitrator shall give a decision within fourteen days concerning the approval or the rejection of the programme or of the part of the programme in dispute.The arbitrator shall be of neutral nationality and shall be of high commercial and financial standing. He shall be appointed by the signatory Governments acting unanimously, or, failing unanimity, by the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice.5. With regard to -deliveries of coal to Italy it might be possible to make a special arrangement on the lines contemplated by Note I attached.6. An agreement- on the lines contemplated by Note II attached might also be concluded with regard to the special programmes referred to in Section 4 of Annex IV to the Young Plan.Xhe British Delegation claims the right to a Reparations Recovery Act levy pari passu with any Deliveries in Kind including those furnished under a moratorium.   This question has been reserved.August 24, 1929.Note No. I.1. By arrangement between France and Italy it becomes possible to equalize, without altering the total yearly amount of Germany&apos;s deliveries in kind, the yearly amounts of the deliveries in kind to be taken by Italy during the ten-year period.Under such an arrangement, Italy&apos;s allocation of deliveries in kind, instead of varying during that period from 75 down to 30 million marks, would be fixed to the amount of 52-J million Reichs marks; the peak of the Italian purchases of coal in Germany on reparations account would therefore be reduced.2. Subject to the above, the Italian State Railways, which during the last few years have used exclusively German reparation coal and no British coal, and which, moreover, have imported reparation coal via sea to the extent of 2,500,000 tons in the year 1927 and 3,000,000 tons in the year 1928, are prepared (a) to undertake to purchase on the British market at least 500,000 tons of coal for each year of the ten-year period in question, provided the price f.o.b. Cardiff be not higher than the price for the corresponding qualities f .o.b. Rotterdam; and(b) to undertake to abstain &quot;from importing reparation coal via sea over and above a maximum quantity of 1,500,000 tons per annum.
Heads of Agreement.The following points were agreed upon in principle in order to meet the require-ments of the British Delegation : 1. The other Creditor Powers would guarantee to Great Britain annuities of 36 million marks a year for 37 years, or their equivalent in capital sums, subject to the German Government desisting from any claim in regard to the surplus of the last five months under the Dawes Plan.2. The payments made to Great Britain out of the annuities would be made on such dates as to secure that Great Britain receives full cover for her net war debt payments on the 15th June and the 15th December each year instead of the payments to Great Britain being made in equal monthly instalments, with the result of an advantage to Great Britain equivalent on the 5-1 per cent, tables to about 4 million marks a year for 37 years. (This adjustment would not, of course, in any way alter the payments made by Germany.)3. Great Britain would receive as an unconditional annuity the 36 million marks referred to above, 18 million marks from the balance of the uncon-ditional annuity available under the Plan for distribution, and a further 42 million marks to be made available by rearranging (subject to the consent of Germany) the annual amounts of the unconditional annuity without increasing their aggregate total, in such a way that the amount available for distribution to the Creditor Governments after meeting the service of the Dawes Loan should be a fixed instead of a varying sum each year.4. The Italian Delegation undertook that the Italian State Railways would purchase 1 million tons of British coal yearly for three years at the best British free market export price ruling at the date of each contract.o
