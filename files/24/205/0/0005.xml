My colleagues will see that my advisers recommend that there is an overwhelming case in equity for legislating in order to relieve the Communications Company of Stamp Duties. But the whole scheme for the formation of this Merger in its present form was bitterly fought in the last Parliament by the Labour Party, and I am therefore unwilling to reach a conclusion without hearing the views of the Cabinet on the political aspects of the question. Perhaps I should add that, if it is decided to make the concession, the necessary clause (in general terms, whose application to this particular case would, however, be obvious) would.be included in the Finance Bill of 1930. In the meantime the Company would be required to pay the duty in return for a promise of repayment on the passage into law of the Finance Bill in question.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, July 15, 1929.Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Eastern, Eastern Extension and Western Telegraph Companies, and the Marconi Company have now been merged in a single company under the title of &quot; Cables and Wireless, Limited.&quot; It was originally intended that the merger should embrace the whole of the interests and activities of the constituent Companies (Investments, Manufactures, Communications). Subsequently, however, it was decided that a separate Company should be formed to take over the communications assets of the constituent Companies, together with the Pacific Cable undertaking, the West Indian undertaking, the Imperial Trans-Atlantic Cables and Post Office Beam Wireless. This separate Company has now been registered under the title of &quot; Imperial and International Communications Company, Limited.&quot;The amount of Stamp Duty payable in respect of the capital of Cables and Wireless, Limited, and Imperial and International Communications, Limited, cannot yet be precisely computed, but will be approximately  465,000 on Cables and Wireless, Limited (assuming that at least 90 per cent, of the shares of the old companies are acquired*), and between  200,000 and  230,000 on Imperial and International Communications, Limited.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.P.

I^Transfer^duty amounting1 &apos;to&apos;&apos;r&amp;i%s&amp;h^Mi%Q,()()0;wb&apos;uid!&apos;als6 have&apos;&apos;been  payable-by Cables and Wireless, Limited, if steps had not been taken to alter the Articles of Association of the constituent Companies so as to permit of &quot;verbal transfers.&quot; This device has been adopted in other similar cases, and is strictly within the letter of the existing law. Its employment has, indeed, been prohibited by the Companies * Act, 1929, but this Act does not come into force until the 1st November next.Relief from payment of Stamp Duty in respect of the capital of Cables and Wireless, Limited, is not in question. This Company has not been formed, at the instance of Government, nor has Government had any say in its capitalisation at  53 millions. Clearly, in such circumstances, no special relief from duty could be justified., There can equally be no doubt that there is a strong case for remission of the Stamp Duty payable on the capital of the Communications Company. The creation of a separate Company to deal with communications alone formed no part of the Merger Scheme drawn up by the Cable and Wireless Companies, but has been solely due to action taken by the Imperial Cable and Wireless Conference with the cognizance and authority of the Governments concerned. It was strongly felt by those Governments and by their representatives on the Conference that a Public Utility Corporation responsible for the Oversea Communication Services of the Empire should be self-contained and entirely dissociated from the manufacturing and investment activities of the Cable and Wireless Companies. When the matter came before the Imperial Conference, the Merger Scheme was already so far developed that it would have been impossible to recast it so as to limit its operation to the communi-cations assets of the constituent Companies. The alternative proposal was, therefore, made, and accepted by-the Companies, that a separate Communications Company holding the communications assets and confined to the communications work should be set up as a Public Utility Corporation separate from and independent of the merger proper. The shares of the Communications Company will, however, all be owned by the cable companies and Marconi&apos;s in which the Merger Company has a controlling interest, so that the Merger Company will receive the profits of the Com-munications Company subject to a portion being set aside for reduction of charges to the public and increased royalty to the Post Office if the profits exceed a certain figure. The question of Stamp Duties on the Communications Company was raised during the negotiations by the Companies. They were told by Sir Otto Niemeyer, one of the Financial Advisers to the Conference, that this was a question which would need arrangement with the Revenue Authorities, but that, speaking in a purely personal capacity, he thought that the Companies should not be called on to pay extra Stamp Duties as the result of their falling in with the Government&apos;s wishes.The claim, therefore, for relief from payment of Stamp Duty in respect of the capital of the Communications Company rests not merely on the fact that the Com-munications Company is a Public Utility Corporation with definite limitations on its profits and subject, through the Advisory Committee, to a considerable measure of Government control, but also on the special circumstances which led to its formation as a separate Company.The appended memorandum, which has been drawn up in the Inland Revenue Department, gives the history of the stamp duty reliefs extended to amalgamations and summarises the reasons which have been held to justify exemption from duty in ^certain special cases. The arguments for remission in this case appear to be at least as strong as the arguments for remission in the case of railways and mines. In particular, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Communications Company is an Imperial concern and that the Dominion Governments might, with some justifica-tion, take exception to the heavy charge which payment of stamp duty would inflict -on the Company&apos;s revenues, on the ground that it would operate so as to deprive the ;user of substantial benefits to which, under the provisions of the standard net revenue ^arrangement, he would otherwise have been entitled.It is understood that Sir Basil Blackett has tentatively suggested that the diffi-culty of providing for remission of Stamp Duty in this case by legislation could be -avoided if the capital of the Communications Company were fixed at the nominal sum of  100. But this is clearly an unacceptable solution. The capitalisation of the Communications Company was the subject of prolonged enquiry by the Cable and Wireless Conference and its Expert Advisers, and a figure of  30 million was accepted by them as reasonable and was subsequently endorsed not only in the course of negotiations with the representatives of the Cable and Wireless interests, but also during the discussion on the Imperial Telegraphs Bill.   Capitalisation at a nominal
8 sfigure would be rightly regarded.as, a, flagrant piece of tax dodging, all ,the more objectionable in this case for the reason that capitalisation at the figure qf  30 millions is intimately related to the agreed standard net revenue figure jbjf :  1,665,000, and is thus an essential component of that part of the scheme which relates to limitation of profits. - :The facts of the case clearly point to the conclusion that the Company has^iir equity an unanswerable case for remission of Capital duty and that it would&apos;be ri&quot;ht to legislate for that purpose:An amount between  25,000 and  30,000 will in any event be payable as stamp7&apos;&apos; duties on ike transfer of the Government cables and wireless to the Communications&apos;1 Company; but these duties are not duties which fall on the Communications Company owing to the intervention of the Government, inasmuch as it was intended, but for this intervention, to transfer these assets to the Merger Company, and duty would then have been payable in respect thereof. There is, therefore, no case for relief from these duties.Memorandum by the Board of Inland Revenue.Companies Capital Duty is charged on the authorised nominal capital of all companies having limited liability, and is payable on the authorisation of the capital either by the first formation of a company or by the increase of the capital of an existing company. Subject to the exceptions described below, the duty is payable without regard to the purpose for which the capital is created and whether the nominal capital is subsequently issued for cash or in exchange for valuable assets, or remains unissued.   The rate of the duty has been  1 per cent, since 1920.Conveyance or Transfer Duty, also at the rate of  1 per cent., is charged on the conveyance or transfer of any property. In connection with the amalgamation or reconstruction of companies the duty would be payable, but for the exceptions described below, when one company acquires the shares of another company, or such property as lands and buildings, book debts, goodwill, but not stock in trade.Prior to 1921 the position with regard to amalgamation of companies was, therefore, that Capital Duty had to be paid on the new nominal capital created to effect the amalgamation whether by the formation of a new company or by the increase of the capital of one company to enable it to absorb the others proposed to be amalgamated. Transfer Duty also had to be paid on the value of the shares transferred, if the amalgamation was effected by exchange of shares, or on the value of the assets taken over (excluding stock in trade) if the amalgamation Avas effected by acquisition of the undertaking of the absorbed companies.railways Act, 1921. The first exception to the normal operation of the duties was made in the Railways Act, 1921. This Act, which was a Government measure, compelled the amalgamation of the railway companies of the country into groups. The amount of Capital and Transfer Duties which would have been involved by amalgamations on this scale was so enormous that the Government felt that the companies ought not to be compelled to accept amalgamation at such a price, and consequently a provision was inserted into the Act (Section 7 (4)), which relieved companies from all stamp duties involved by the amalgamations effected by the Act. It is to be noted that this exemption covered not only the main stamp duties affected (Capital and Transfer duties), but also other smaller duties, e.g., the duty on Debenture Capital at 2/6 per  100.Mining Industry Act, 1926. -A further exception was made in the Mining Industry Act, 1926. This Act, which was also a Government measure, provided for some degree of compulsion towards the amalgamation of mining companies, and contained in Section 5 (2) an exemption from consequential stamp duties similar to. the exemption contained in the Railways Act, 1921, and granted partly for the same reasons as led to the exemption in favour of railways and partly as an inducement towards voluntary amalgamations.Both the Railway Act and the Mining Act exemptions apply, of course, to particular industries only and for particular reasons, and in both cases the details of amalgamation schemes were subject to the control of an independent tribunal-^-the Railway and Canal Commission. The Railway Act exemption is now expired, and the Mining Act exemption, although still operative, has been to a considerable extent superseded by the Finance Act exemption next described.
Finance Act, 192 :U4-While the^Minihg- industry&apos;Act was passing through Parliament, the Company Law Amendment Committee had reported, and had included in their Report recommendations to the effect that in the case of amalgama-tions and reconstructions of companies Capital Duty should not be payable on new capital created to replace existing capital which had already paid duty, nor should Transfer Duty be paid on shares or other assets taken over by the amalgamating company. The reasons underlying the recommendation were that an amalgamation, provided it is complete, is a change of form rather than of substance, and that the duties, were distinctly a deterrent to the beneficial process of amalgamation. No reference was made by the Committee to the minor stamp duties sometimes involved in amalgamation.Section 55 of the Finance Act, 1927, founded on these recommendations, therefore provides that in the case of amalgamations or reconstructions of companies, whether by acquisition of undertakings, or by acquisition of at least 90 per cent, of issued shares, the new capital created to replace the share capital of the absorbed companies shall be relieved of duty to the extent to which the capital of the absorbed companies had paid duty, and no duty shall be charged on the necessary transfers of property or shares.The Finance Act relief is available to the Merger Company and to the Communications Company, and has been taken into account in the figures given above of the amounts of duty payable; but the relief is only small (between  70,000 and  90,000 for each company), because it is based upon the nominal capital of the old companies, which is very much less than the market value of their shares, which in turn governs the capitalisation of the new companies.o
