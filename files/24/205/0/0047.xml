CONTRIBUTORY PENSIONS SCHEME PROPOSED AMENDING bill memorandum &quot;by Minister of Health and Secretary of __State for Scotland.A Meeting was held yesterday to consider the Cabinet instruction contained in Conclusion No.8. of the 28th July, 1929, . to the effect that the Minister of Health, The Chancellor of &quot;Hie Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Sootland &quot;should ooneert the most effective measure they could with the money available to carry out the policy of the Government&quot;.The following were present :-The Rt. Hon. A. Greenwood, M.P.Minister of Health.Mr. Tom Johnston, &amp;.P.Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Sootland.There were in attendanceSir W.A.Robinson, G.O.B., C.3.E., Ministry of Health. Sir W. Xinnear, K.B.3., Ministry of Health. Sir A. Watson, Z.C.B.    Government Actuary. Sir A.W.Hurst, K.B.S., C.B., Treasury. Mr. John Jeffrey, C.B., C.B.E., Department of health for Scotland. Mr. P. Taylor.   Department of Health for Scotland.On the assumption that the proposals to be inserted in the Amending Bill are not to involve expenditure in excess of the money available as reported by the Government Actuary, it was generally agreed that the scheme outlined by the Kinister of Health in his memo. (C 32(29 )) dated the 23rd July, 1929, made
a selection of the new heneficiaries on as fair a basis as could be devised in the circumstances.It should, however, be clearly understood that with respect to pre-Act Widows, the selection is a purely arbitrary one and we think that the attention of the Cabinet should be specially drawn to the faot that our proposed Amending Bill will still exclude from pension -(a) All childless pre-Act widows (that is childless women who became widows prior to the 4th January, 1926) until they reach the age of 65, and(b) on reaching 65 all of these widows who were under 50 years of age when their husbands died.The exclusion of the classes above mentioned is bound to evoke strong criticism and if the Bill is to be proceeded with on the lines proposed, authority should be given to have the announcement emphatically made that the Bill is only a first instalment of the Government&apos;a proposals on the subject.A.G. W.A.September 19th,19  9.
