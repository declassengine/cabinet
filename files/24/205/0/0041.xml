Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1929,SECRET. . Copy No.    34CP. 241 (29).Cabinet.SITUATION IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.COPIES of telegrams relating to the situation have been circulated at regular intervals and the fullest possible information has also been given to the Press, I do not therefore propose here to discuss the course of events up to date, but only the situation as it stands to-day, the steps that are being taken, and the problems that remain to be decided.1. While it may generally be said that the situation has been kept in hand owing to the prompt arrival of reinforcements, it cannot be denied that the country has not settled down as promptly as might have been hoped. Only a few days ago, in an appreciation in which the High Commissioner concurred, the O.C. Troops said : &quot;The whole country is disaffected, practically everywhere disorder, or threat of disorder, has occurred, and demands for protection, which cannot be ignored, are still being received by me. Originally, it is true, the trouble was between Jews and Arabs, and not against the Government, yet there, is clear evidence that Arabs are now becoming antagonistic to authority if only because their designs are being frustrated, and the tendency is growing. Also, it is aggravated by trans-frontier tribes&apos; attitude. Although the situation in this respect to east and west is for the moment much better, in the north-east and north; it is decidedly worse.&quot; The O.C. Troops added that in some places, such as Haifa, Arabs were openly boasting that they would recommence outrages as soon as our control had relaxed. Since then, however, the situation has appreciably improved.Reporting on the 5th September, the O.C. Troops telegraphed as follows : &apos;&apos; With the possible exception of Guzziwiyeh, East Beisan, that, however, can be dealt with, the attitude in Trans-Jordan is quiet. The Bedouins in South Beersheba, who have been excited by false rumours, have been reassured and are now quiet. Internally a good effect has been produced by the arrests resulting from the numerous raids, and disorder seems to have stopped generally. But the attitude of the Moslems in the country is by no means settled, vide manifesto full of falsehoods and inflammatory material which have been issued to Moslems in other countries. Watch must be kept on the possible effect of these, both internally and externally. I am considering the withdrawal of some of the outlying posts and will do so as soon as I safely can.&quot;The O.C. Troops also reports that, owing to the establishment by the French of strong posts on Syrian frontier, the chance of organised bodies crossing that frontier is less. There is no confirmation of the Central News report which appeared on the 6th September of an attempted invasion by mounted Bedouins from the Sinai Peninsula.Reinforcements sent to Palestine at an early stage in the disturbances were as follows :-5 warships &quot; Bar ham,&quot;   &quot;Sussex,&quot;   &quot;Courageous,&quot;   &quot;Wanderer&quot; and&quot;Veteran.&quot; 3 battalions of infantry. 1 squadron armoured cars (Lancers). 2-J sections armoured cars (R.A.F.). 1 squadron and 1 flight RA.F.It has not be found necessary, as yet, to send any further reinforcements, though a request has been made for further infantry, partly to enable the Naval detachment . [19887]
to be withdrawn. The question whether there is any need for such reinforcements will be considered further on the arrival in Palestine of Air Vice-Marshal Dowding. Measures to be taken or in contemplation.2. (a.) Police. It was clear from the outset that, for the present at any rate, a largely increased staff of British Police will be required. The Acting High Commissioner asked for 100 constables to. be recruited, and the Crown Agents for the Colonies are now occupied in selecting these men on an engagement of one year&apos;s duration. The High Commissioner has been asked whether he does not consider that it might be advisable to engage a further 100.(b.) Justice. The High Commissioner reported on the 28th August that the following arrangements had been made : (i.) Magistrates&apos; cases to be taken forthwith.(ii.) District Commissioners to take preliminary steps for imposing collective fines.(iii.) Indictable offences to be taken as soon as the Police are able to prepare. and present the evidence, (iv.) Magistrates to be British for the Summary and Committal proceedings, (v.) An Ordinance to be enacted providing that the District Courts in the first instance and on appeal will consist of a single British Judge, and that the Courts of Criminal Assizes will consist of two British Judges, (vi.) The Court of Appeal will in fact be constituted of two British judges and one Palestinian Judge, or three British Judges, (vii.) Until District Officers  can be released for Magisterial  duties,  the Presidents of the District Courts are acting in that capacity.On the 3rd September the High Commissioner reported that he had enacted the Ordinance foreshadowed above, and another Ordinance enabling him to appoint public officers to exercise the powers of District Commissioners and of the Collective Punishments Ordinance, 1926.(c.) Commission. As announced in the Press of the 4th September, I have decided to appoint a Commission of Enquiry which will proceed to Palestine this month to enquire into the immediate causes which have led to the recent outbreak, including the extent to which it may be regarded as having been preconcerted, or due to organised action.I annex for convenience of reference the full text of the announcement made on this subject (Appendix I).(d.) Wailing Wall. It will be seen from the High Commissioner^ telegram No. 164 of the 4th September (Appendix II) that, in his view, claims of both parties are irreconcilable, and that he is satisfied that no ruling by him or by any person or body in Palestine at the present time would be accepted by either party. He, there-fore, recommends that a Commission be appointed under Article 14 of the Mandate, the terms of reference of which should be confined to studying, defining and determination-ing the rights and claims of Moslems and Jews in connection with the Wailing Wall. I have not yet been able fully to examine this proposal, but I am enquiring from Sir J. Chancellor what are his proposals for the composition of such a body, and in the probable event of its taking a long time to set up, what course of action he proposes to pursue in the meantime. This is of particular importance in view of the fact that Yom Kippur (the Jewish Day of Atonement, on which trouble occurred at the Wall last year) begins on the evening of the 13th October. Finance.3. It is evident that the effect of the disturbance on the finance of the Palestine Government will be very serious. The surplus in the hands of the Government at the end of 1928 amounted to approximately  500,000, and the estimate for the current year, in spite of careful economy, anticipated a deficit of  126,000. It will he seen therefore that Palestine^ working margin is a very small one.I annex as Appendix III. the High Commissioners telegram No. 163 of the 4th; September, which deals with the various financial aspects of. the present disturbances.The incidence of the Military, Air Force and Naval expenditure must necessarily he a matter for careful consideration,.hut. I vyjould ask my colleagues when the time comes to treat Palestine as sympathetically as possible, and not to overload the Government, which has struggled into solvency only by the exercise of a rigid economy in Defence forces, which investigation may well show to have been among the causes of the present disturbances..,,v&apos;-- r- in&quot;. .&apos;..; v-:,,  .,;,;;   . p.&apos; Colonial Office, September 6, 1929.
APPENDIX II.Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 4th September, 1929. (Received Colonial Office 3-55 a.m. 5th September, 1929.) No. 164, 4th September.Please refer to the last paragraph of my Proclamation of 1st September concerning application of principle laid down in White Paper of 19th November, 1928, regarding Wailing Wall. Recent events have led me to the conclusion that the proposals contained in your despatch 14th August, Confidential, that an Ordinance should be passed conferring upon the High Commissioner power to make Regulations declaring what may and what may not be done at the Wailing Wall and to impose penalties for breaches of such Regulations will not now bring about a settlement of the question. In view of the bitter feelings that have been aroused by recent incidents at the Wall, the attention of Jews, Arabs and Moslems throughout the world is concentrated upon this question. The claims of both parties are irreconcilable-cilable, and I am satisfied that no ruling by me or by any person or body in Palestine at the present time would be accepted by either party. Up to the present time the Government has received only claims . and evidence submitted by each party separately, which have not, therefore, been subjected to tests usually employed on cases of conflict of rights. I am advised that, even if it is decided that legislation is an appropriate method of dealing with the question, no act by the Government Of Palestine purporting to be declaratory as to rights or practice would be regarded as authoritative unless it were based upon the finding of an&apos; Enquiry commanding general confidence both in Palestine and abroad both as to its composition a.nd procedure. Acting Attorney-General also advises me that proposed Regulations would exclude a plea in defence based upon the exercise of rights. &apos;! -Feelings of both parties as to their rights now run so high that to impose penalties for breaches of Regulations and to exclude a plea in defence that breachesRestoration of Order in Palestine. Commission of Enquiry. Instructions were issued some days ago by the Palestine Government for the collection of evidence before it disappeared as to whether the disorders which commenced on the 23fd August were spontaneous or preconcerted. In the meantime, while His Majesty&apos;s forces are actively co-operating.with the Palestine Government in restoring order, energetic steps are being taken by the Civil authorities to bring to trial guilty individuals. Many arrests have been made, and considerable progress has already been made in dealing with summary cases. Special measures are being taken to provide for impartial tribunals to cope with what will probably be a large number of cases.At the request of the High Commissioner, the Secretary of State for the Colonies is appointing a commission of enquiry, which will proceed to Palestine this month, to enquire into the immediate causes which have led to the recent outbreak, including the extent to which it may be regarded as having been preconcerted or due to organised action.The Chairman of the Commission will be Sir Walter Shaw, late Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements, and there will be associated with him three Members of Parliament, selected one from each of the three political parties.In view of suggestions which have been made in certain quarters, the Secretary of State desires to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no idea of reconsidering the British tenure of the mandate for Palestine, and that no enquiry is contemplated which might alter the position of this country in regard to the Mandate or the policy, laid down in the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and embodied in the Mandate, of establishing in Palestine a National Home for the Jews.The enquiry now initiated is therefore limited to the immediate emergency and will not extend to considerations of major policy. When its report has been received it will be a matter of earnest consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government along what lines within the terms of the Mandate, future policy in Palestine should be directed.Colonial Office, September 3, 1929.
were based upon exercise of rights would be intolerable to Moslems and Jews alike. I would further observe that proposals contained in paragraph 9 of my despatch 14th June, 1929, Confidential, deal only with appurtenances of Jews worshipping. These have been and always will be regarded as of great importance, but claims by the Moslems of right to build up on property contiguous to the Wall has now. assumed even greater importance in the eyes of the Jews^ and are causing difficulties to the Government. In these circumstances in accordance with proposals made in Luke&apos;s despatch of 19th October, 1928, I recommend that a Commission be appointed, under Article 14 of the Mandate, terms of reference of which should be confined to studying, defining and determining rights and claims of Moslems and Jews in connection with the Wailing Wall. In his despatch of 29th November, Confidential B, your predecessor stated that he was opposed to this suggestion except in very last resort. I am of the opinion that that stage has now been reached. There is no possibility of Moslems and Jews arriving at a settlement by agreement and the Acting Attorney-General advises that the Government has not the power to determine respective rights of the two parties. Without either sanction of an agreement between communities or an authoritative determination of their respective rights, orders of the Government in relation to the Wall whether peacefully acquiesced in or enforced would rest upon no foundation recognised by Moslems or Jews. I am aware that when efforts were made in 1922 to frame a scheme for establishment of Commission contemplated in section 14 of Mandate opposition was offered by Catholic Powers, but I submit that if by its terms of reference Commission is confined to the task of studying, defining and deterniining the matters in dispute between the Moslem and Jewish communities it is possible that the objections of those nations to the appointment of a Commission might in the circumstances be withdrawn. The maintenance of order in Palestine depends largely on the settlement of the Wailing &quot;Wall question and I would urge that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take necessary steps under section 14 of the Mandate for the appointment of such a Commission, since it is only with sanction provided by rulings of such a Commission that the Government can be enabled to act in this matter with unchallenged authority and thereby to discharge Mandate obligation of maintaining order.APPENDIX III.Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 4th September, 1929.(Received Colonial Office 6-25 p.m. 4th September, 1929.)No. 168 of 4th September.I-have authorised expenditure from Civil funds for providing food temporarily for Jewish refugees concentrated in Safad and for Jewish refugees evacuated from Hebron and concentrated in Jerusalem until Jewish relief funds are available for this purpose or until refugees have homes to which they can return.I have appointed Abramson to act under Ordinance regarded as 159 for the purpose of assessing collective fines in disturbed areas and compensation in accordance with provisions of Section 5 and Section 6 of Collective Punishment Ordinance, 1926. It will be realised that it will be necessary to spread collection of fines over period of years.I have authorised expenditure from civil funds for pay and other charges of additional 100 British Police for remainder of 1929, and have made provision for whole year in Estimates for 1930, and have authorised expenditure from civil funds for evacuation and treatment of civilian wounded in hospital and other special police and civil expenditure on incidental emergency operations of the past ten days.In view of financial position of the Government, and serious effect of the present disturbances on collection of revenue, I presume that the Middle East vote will ultimately be charged with cost of all military, Air Force and naval forces employed in Palestine, including necessary local expenditure on billeting, transport and local supplies which has been incurred mainly owing to lack of provision of tents for troops and inadequate establishment of War Department transport essential for mobility of troops. However, at request of General Officer Commanding, I have authorised Director of Public Works to arrange and pay for billeting of troops and employment of civilian transport for military requirements acting on requisition of General Officer Commanding, and payments are being treated as advances to military authorities. Request authority for Military to reimburse civil Government these payments locally.
