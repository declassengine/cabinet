C , This DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CRET.P. 250/29Copy No.3 cabinet.TRADE OUTLOOK. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the information of the Cabinet the Minutes of the September meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council giving reports on industry and trade for July and August.In the coal trade there has been an improvement in the exporting districts, but none in those concerned with inland sales. The iron and steel trade has shared the general quietness of the holiday season, but the number of blast furnaces In operation in August has Increased by three and the normal Autumn expansion of business Is expected to take place.    In engineering the situation Is much the same as In recent months.    Good reports have been received of several new types of equipment for burning pulverised coal Ir- ships, but this is still, of course, in the experimental stage.    Thfc fine weather has helped the motor and tyre trades, though foreign competition, both at home and In neutral markets, is still very strong.    It Is said that great efforts are being made by the United States to capture the aircraft manufacturing business and that designs and patents are being widely bought up for that purpose.In the cotton trade there has been considerable hesitancy during and Immediately after the recent wages dispute, though there has been a slight improvement In the last two weeks.     The Lancashire Cotton Corporation and the Combined Egyptian Mills Limited continue to make progress In absorbing mills In their respective spheres.     The reports from the woollen trade are bad.-1-
The continued drop in the prices of the raw material in the last few years has brought about the greatest hesitancy among manufacturers and the present wages discussion is generally overshadowing the industry.The chemical trade is well maintained in spite of depression in industries using chemicals.     The sales of the Co-operative Societies have continued to increase, though, the other retail stores report some difficulty in maintaining their previous year&apos;s figures.W. G.Board of Trade,26th September, 1929.

MR. SMITH expressed the President&apos;s regret at his absence. He had returned to London only the previous afternoon, and Mr. Smith thought that those who had followed hie movements during the last few weeks would readily&quot;&apos;excuse his attendance there that morning.He regretted to have to inform Members of the Council of the death of Mr. Maunder, which occurred suddenly at his home on the 13th August.    He was the Head of the Intelligence and Parliamentary Branch of the Board and had been Secretary to the Council since its formation.       Mr. Smith thought it would be the desire of Members that he should write to Mr. Maunder&apos;s relatives conveying an expression of their deep sympathy.BUSINESS MISSION TO SOUTH AMERIOA.MR. SMITH referred to the proposed Anglo-Argentine agreement which had received considerable publicity in the press in the last few days.    It was not.possible at the moment to give any definite Information in regard to this agreement, because it would have to be subjected to a detailed examination before its final form was settled.    At the moment its general lines had been settled and undoubtedly there would be an agreement made, but nothing definite could be stated until the details had been worked out.MR. HOSB associated himself with the congratulations that had been expressed regarding the provisional agreement with the Argentine Government.    As regards the consumption of the Argontine products here no credit was required, but if arrangements had been made which would result in our supplying  8 million worth more of manufactures to the Argentine, that would indeed be most satisfactory;    He hoped that the Mission would be able to do something in Brazil,  although he confeussd at the moment that he did not see what that would be.    If the consumption of coffee in Great Britain could be increased,  it would be a godsend to Brazil,  as Brazil was in great difficulty in that respect.    She was faced with the prospect of a huge crop, whilst she already had in hand a supply that would certainly not be shipped for eighteen months.    She was so rich in coffee and.so poor in money, that companies talked of distributing coffee dividends.COAL.MR. WARHAM wished to say how much the British coal trade appreciated the splendid fight put up by the President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the Exchequer at The Hague.    In the matter of reparations in kind, they felt that the serious dangers arising from the Young plan had been avoided and that much had been done to help the coal trade after the serious injuries it had suffered from the policy of reparations in kind.The weekly output of the United Kingdom for the three weeks ended August 24th was as under:Week ended August 10th   3,253,000 tons (Bank Holiday) &quot; &quot; *        17th   5,135,000      &quot;H &quot; &quot;        24th   5,115,000      &quot;
OPAL (CONTD.)It would &quot;be seen that the production of coal during the period under review was considerably below our best.    Those collieries selling their coal inland had found a considerable shortage of orders.    Exporting districts, on the other hand, had been fully employed and the level of prices appeared to be riBing. -   There had been slight increases of wages in Germany, France and Belgium, and moro recently in Poland and Holland, all of which was tending to bring those countries&apos; costs nearer to the level of our own.The total output of the United Kingdom during the seven months ended July 31st was 148 million tons, as compared with 139 million tons in 1928, 148 million tons in 1927, and 168 million tons in 1913.    The total exports for the same periods were nearly 34 million tons in the seven months of 1929, 28f million tons in 1928, 30-1 million tons in 1927 and 42- -million tons in 1913.   The 1929 export figures substantially exceeded those of 1927 and 1928, which was a very hopeful sign. The quantity of coal exported in July this year was 5,600,000 tons, as compared with 4,700,000 tons the previous month.   Tho value per ton f,o.b. in July showed a slight increase over   &apos; June, being 15/lld as against 15/9d.   The increased exports wore widely spread,  every one of our principal markets, excepting Spain, taking more coal.    It was interesting to note that Poland was finding the same improvement, her figures for export by sea having increased from an average of 597,000 tons per month in 1928 to over 750,000 tons per month during the last three months.   This was at the rate of 9,000,000 tons a year and was a trade which had grown from nothing in 1925.The number of persons employed in the industry for the week ending 24th August was 924,400,    as compared with a weekly average in 1913 of 1,110,100,  and equal to 83.S per cent, of the 1913 figure.   Unemployment for the month of July was 18,2 per cent, as compared with 18.3 per cent, in June and an average of 21,9 per cent,  in 1928.    The prospects for the winter months appeared to be brighter than they had been for some years past.Following the request of the Government, all districts were engaged in attempting to form associations to control production and selling prices in their areas.   Great, if not insuperable, difficulty was being found in reconciling the views of the inland and exporting districts.MR. MITCHELL said that the position in the coal trade in Scotland confirmed what Mr. Warham had said regarding the industry in general.    Considerable improvements wore shown and the output had been increasing, and this especially applied to the East Ooast where there had been a better shipping business. There was still idle time at some of the oollieries, especially in Lanarkshire.    While shipping had improved, this appeared to be due to increased demand in existing markets, rather than to the recapturing of old markets, and whether this was temporary or permanent was difficult to say.    The shipments of Polish coal were still increasing, as Mr. Warham had reported, but noty/ithstanding the subsidising of shipments the Polish collieries were reported to bo losing money.    Losses were still being shown for the Scottish coal trade, but the prospects were better for the Autumn and Yifinter trade.    Mr. Mitoheil desired to support-what I-ir. Warham had said regarding the value of the modifications obtained at The Hague Conference.    The arrange-mente generally should be of advantage to the coal trade and
confidential. COAL (OONTD.)that doing away with the power of disposal was of special value both to the ooal trade and to the engineering trade.   The provisions proposed in the Young Plan might have had very serious consequences   to the ooal trade.IRON AND STEEL.MR. BOND wrote -&quot;As a result of the holiday season conditions in the iron and stoel markets during August were fairly quiet on the whole, but greater activity was noted towards the end of the month.   The production of pig iron showed a further slight expansion in August and the number of blast furnaces in operation increased by three during the month.    Steel production-declined, during the month owing to the holidays, but was higher than in any August since the war.   The immediate outlook for the British iron and stoel industry is not unfavourable for, although there has been little expansion in the volume of business actually transacted, the increased enquiry whioh has been noted is regarded as an indication that the usual Autumn revival in demand may be expected during the present month;    the position is, however, too dependent on developments on the Continent to be regarded as satisfactory.&quot;Production on the North East Ooast in August was rather less than in the previous month owing to the local annual holidays, and the number of orders on the books also showed, a decline.   The shipbuilding yards are well oocupied, but the demand for shipbuilding material shows some falling off owing to the soarcity of orders for new vessels.   Generally speaking, the constructional engineering trades are busy.   While new business in finished steel is fairly quiet on the North East Ooast, the works have sufficient orders in the main to keep them oocupied until the usual Autumnal expansion in demand begins to make itself felt.&quot;British steel makers have experienced keen competition from Continental manufacturers, particularly for semi-finished material:    the downward trend in Continental quotations has adversely affected home prices for this class of material. There has been a substantial increase in tho price of coke, and prices of other raw materials have also shown an upward tendenoy.   Apart from tho downward trend in semi-finished steel selling prices have remained practically stationary during the month.    The proportion between home and export trade has remained substantially the same.    Generally speaking the prospects for the industry as a whole on the North East Coast are regarded as favourablo, although some apprehension is caused by the oontinued increase in the cost of raw materials without any corresponding advance in the prioe of saleable products.&quot;In Scotland the position of the iron and steel industry may be summarised by saying that production during the past month has been fairly well maintained but the slow rate at which new business is coming forward is causing a certain amount of anxiety.   Conditions are reported to be quiet on the home market, but there has recently been increased activity, on the export market, which, it Is hoped, will keep the industry well employed into the Autumn.    Conditions in the shipyards are unoertainj    although they are busy at the moment,&quot; it is not clear whether further business will be obtained on the completion
IRON AND STEEL (COMTD.)of the work now in hand-,      Prices of raw materials are still high, but there has so far been no further advance in the prices of finished commodities, although it is considered that from the point of view of producing costs an advance would be justified. It is reported that the steps which have been taken to cope with foreign competition in the home market have met with a certain measure of success, as a result of which imports of finished commodities have shown a substantial decline; consider-able tonnages of semi-finished material are still being imported however.     Keen foreign competition continues to be experienced in the export markets.&quot;In the Midland area production during August remained on approximately the same level as in the previous month.     The &quot;order books also showed no marked change, but conditions as regards new business are fairly quiet.     Very few contracts are at present being placed by the structural engineering trades and the volume of new business generally is only small.&quot;Generally speaking the Continental iron and steel markets were characterised by the dull conditions usual during August. The works were well occupied in the main with work in hand, but new business came in rather slowly, and prices generally showed a weakening tendency.     It Is reported that the steel manufacturers of Germany, France, Belgium and Luxemburg have recently concluded a &quot;gentlemen^ agreement&quot; for the purpose of first stabilising, and later on improving, the price level: no official statement has been made, however, and It is not clear what methods are to be adopted to achieve this end.      In Germany it Is stated that the export prices quoted by the French, Belgian and Luxemburg works are at present some 2/- per ton lower on the average than those of the German works and. that, even with this difference, prices on the export market are unfavourable from the point of view of German manufacturers.     Continental steel circles in general are anticipating renewed activity in demand during the present month.&quot;The extent to which this anticipated increase In demand materialises will probably influence the course of events in this country, for much of the improvement which has taken place during recent months in the general Iron and steel position of the United Kingdom is to be attributed to the high levels of activity that have obtained In the Continental iron and steel Industry, in consequence of which British steel makers have received orders for which Continental manufacturers could not promise satisfactory deliveries.&quot;In South Wales there is some slight improvement in the sheet trade - some works have, restarted, but the demand is not satisfactory.      In tinplates the industry continues to work at from 75% to 80$ of capa6ity.     The tinplate market is better, but steel makers are again experiencing competition in sheet bars from the Continent which are once more being offered at from 20/-to 25/- a ton under the .,:elsh price.&quot;
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).MR. PUGH reported little ohange in the iron and steel industry.     In almost every seotion there was still a good deal of Idle plant, in spite of the fact that the somewhat improved position of the present year was being maintained. In the blast furnace section, however, the output had not altogether met the demand and there had been an extension of the number of furnaces In operation In the Northern area. In regard to semi-finished material, August had been a some-what poor month and, owing to slackness in the demand for tin plates and sheets, the steel bar trade was being affected in its production.    The foreign prices of this commodity had also tended to fall and considerable orders had gone abroad. On the other hand, Staffordshire manufacturers of marked bars were doing much better.    The tinplate trade remained somewhat quiet.    There were quite a number of mills Idle, the annual holidays had been prolonged in consequence of the condition of trade and the stop week system was still in operation.From the North east Coast came the best reports? they seemed to have work to kB ep them busy there for some time. The effect of the decision of the Admiralty to hold up wt*rk was noticeable in Scotland and the Midlands.     There were considerable orders for railway material, but a falling off of orders for structural steel.   The galvanised steel trade remained about the same;    there had been an effort to raise prices somewhat, but trade was falling off and there were a considerable number of Idle mills.MR. MITCHELL reported that there was little change in the iron and steel trade.   Prices for pig iron were higher. The scrap position at the steel works was- perhaps a little easier as regards supplies, but there was no reduction in price.    The costs at the steel works had been Increased, considerably more than Jthe increase in prices obtained and&apos; the position was not satisfactory.    There was still no import of Continental pig iron, the only imports from abroad being from India.     The imports of steel from the Continent oontinued high and there had been a reduotion in the price of imported bars and billets.    There was a fair demand in the tube trade and some large orders had recently been obtained for export.NON-FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LXTTELTON wrote:-&quot;There hag been renewed activity In copper, and it appeared at one time last week that a rise in the Copper Exporters&apos; official price was imminent.      Consumers showed a tendency to buy hastily, but this has, we think, been ourbed and as yet no increase In price has materialised.   Business shows some improvement, both In the brass and eleotrioal trade. Demand for lead shows some improvement and business in all trades has been more active.    The most Improvement is shown
NON-FERROUS METALS  (CONTD.).by sheet and pipe workers and the cable trade.     With regard to spelter, the months of June and July were the quietest known for a long time in galvanising, but latterly there has been an improved demand for metal in anticipation of Indian ordersn    In the Swansea area works are not on full time, but a more optimistic tone is noticed.    As mentioned above,  the brass trade has shown some improvement, which resulted in a larger demand for refined.    With regard-to tin quiet oonditions have maintained, with metal going into consumption on an average scale.&quot;ENGINEERING.MR. RICHMOND observed that, in marine engineering, the employment figures both on the North East Coast and on the Clyde showed a slight decline, but all over they were markedly better than a year ago, the percentage in July being 9.3 as against 13.4 last year.    Output in the majority of the shops was fairly normal, but this was being achieved with fewer men.    The general situation was much as it had been for some time past;    there were no indications of any general increase In the demand for tonnage, and marine engineering facilities were more than equal to the production calls on them, so that there was likely to be little difference in the number of men employed for some time to oome.Two of the new vessels to be built for the New Zealand Shipping Company had come to the Clyde and one had gone to Barrow.    These were to be Diesel engined, but it was regrettable that one of the sets of engines was to be supplied from abroad by Messrs. Sulzer of Wlnterthur.    The competition, especially from Germany, for the auxiliary engines for these vessels was very keen and prices were being quoted which were below those for which the same engines were sold In Germany.      The Government of Jugo-Slavia had placed an order for a flotilla leader with Messrs. Yarrow and this firm had also an order from the Government of Colombia for three shallow draft gunboats.    Two Diesel-electric oil tankers for American owners had recently been placed and, although only of 8,900 tons each, they were interesting as additions to the number of electrioally driven vessels. Aooording to Lloyds Register there were now some 60 ships afloat of about 260,000 tons fitted with electric drive, which for certain routes and purposes, was apparently found very satisfactory.    In the Mersey district there was little in the shape of new contractb to record, but Messrs. Cammell Laird and Company were well booked at the moment, with some further work In prospect.      On the North East coast there was a good volume of work in hand and most shops would be moderately well occupied till at least the end of the year.    It was encouraging that much of the work was on
ENGINEERING (CONTD.).foreign account, and should go to further expand the figures of overseas deliveries for this year, which at the end of July were already  2,863,000 ahead of last year.    The total export value of ships for the first seven months was  9,748,107, of which steam accounted for  6,871,000 and motor for  1,620,000.      Repair work on the North East coast was also keeping the shops well employed and some further good work was expeoted.In connection with pulverised fuel developments for marine purposes,  the first vessel wholly designed for the use of this fuel,  the &quot;Berwindlea&quot; had just completed her first voyage, and so far as oould be learnt had given satisfaction.     Another specially designed vessel,  the &quot;Swiftpool&quot;, had also gone into service fitted with a powdered fuel installation of a different system, in which the pulverising was done centrally and the powdered fuel led Into bins over eaoh boiler.      Another system,  that of Messrs. Yarrow, was being installed on the &quot;Amarapoora&quot;. One of the American Shipping Board&apos;s fleet,  the &quot;vfest Alaek&quot; was the first vessel to cross the Atlantic entirely    equipped for using powdered fuel in her three boilers;    she was an &quot;example of another system,  the American-Todd system.    These various combustion methods for marine application were in the early stages of development and, while definite comparable figures of performance were not yet available, they all  indicated the serious endeavours being made by engineers to utilise coal to the best advantage.Regarding the wages situation,  the position was that the employers had not been able to accede to the Unions&apos; request for a conference in the third week in September, and matters were accordingly still in abeyance.In Scotland,  general engineering reports were somewhat patchy.    Structural firms had secured a fair amount of work, and although locomotive builders had recently booked some good orders, they were not yet too well placed.    Machine tool makers had sufficient work to keep them moving, but enquiries were becoming somewhat scarcer.    Crane makers were well occupied.SIR&apos;ERNEST PETTER wrote:-&quot;The foreign trade returns for June were especially disappointing on the side of exports, as they followed the very satisfactory figures recorded in May. But it is gratifying to find that July more than made amends as regards the export trade of our basic industries. Machinery exports,which touched the very low level of 37,800 tons in Juno, increased to 52,000 tons in July.    Imports of machinery over these
ENGINEERING;  (OONTD.)last two months, however, show     but little reduotion from the high rate of preceding months.    The total tonnage of machinery exported, to the end of July this year, amounts to 333,120 tons, which ia fully 7,000 tons below the corresponding aggregate for 1923 (340,540 tons).   As regards Imports of machinery, the total for the seven months of this year is 66,293 tons, as against 58,114 tons last year.    So far in 1929, the average value per ton exported has increased slightly from last year, while the average value per ton of imports has fallen.&quot;Engineering unemployment, which in June fell to 8.dfa of insured workers against 9,1% in May, Increased in July by a very slight margin to 8.6?$.    There was a further improvement in electrical engineering and constructional engineering employment during July, but a slight retrogression as regards the marine and general branches.fflThe latest published issue of Lloyd&apos;e Register Ship-building Returns shows the statistics of marine engines under construction in the various countries of the world as at June 30th last.    At the end of June last, Great Britain was building marine engines of steam reciprocating type of a total h.p. of 360,218, out of a world total of 571,271 h.p. equal to 63/ , and steam turbines of 250,760 h,p. out of a world total of 429,700 h.p.  (excluding, however, turbine engines being built in Germany, in respect of which statistics are not available).    Similarly, British shipbuilders and engineering firms were constructing oil marine engines of 381,046 h.p. or 30,5v5 of the world aggregate of 1,250,963 h.p. Motor vessels of course constitute a larger proportion of total shipping in certain foreign countries than they do in Great Britain, where the percentage of motor to steam tonnage is 10,8 as against a world figure of 11.1.   According to the returns of merchant vessels under construction in this country at June 30th last, motor ships accounted for 40,6% of the total of 1,454,000 tons;    hut in countries abroad the corresponding proportion of motor ship construction was actually 30,8%,    Out of 49 oil tankerB (538,774 gross tons) building in all countries at the end of June, 37 (255,249 tons) were motor vessels.&quot;The question of Imperial Trade has become-e very prominent In current discuseion.    As applied to the products of the engineering industry, it has practically no relevance on the side of imports, but with regard to exports it is pleasing to note that of the total tonnage of machinery of British manufacture exported in 1927 (this is the latest year for which particulars are so far available) nearly 50;S (252,000 tons) went to British countries, as against only 34?&apos; (234,000 tons) of the total in 1913,    This is apart from the admitted growth in our exports of motor vehicles and of railway locomotives to the British Dominions and Possessions&quot;,
CONFIDENTIAL. ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.SIR HUGO HIRST wrote,&quot;Conditions in the heavy electrical engineering industry shew some improvement, and there is some optimism regarding the future, although competition between manufacturers of electrical plant Is very keen.   The placing of various orders by the Electricity Commissioners and Local Authorities has largely been responsible for this Improvement.&quot;In anticipation of an increased demand for electrical commodities, duo to the progress of the Grid Scheme In establishing new and wider fields for the application of electricity, there has also been a very noticeable Improvement in business for wiring material, domestic appliances,  etc., during the past Summer.     Normally the Summer months of the year represent a slack period for electrical trading, but this year a much bettor tone has prevailed than in previous years.     Even in the coal producing areas of the country, a more hopeful spirit has been evident,  and some orders have been placed for electrical material.&quot;The policy of cutting down capital expenditure in the Collieries to a minimum which was so evident twelve months ago, has given way to a more cheerful outlook.    In connection with colliery business, reports from various centres indicate that there are a number of electrification schemes in view, and whilst none of these are on a large scale, there is every reason to believe they will be proceeded with later in the year.&quot;Comparatively quiet conditions have prevailed in the ship-repairing industry,  and whilst no noticeable change has occurred in the iron and steel trades,  some improvement has taken place particularly in the Sheffield district.&quot;Generally speaking,  there 1b no doubt that the demand for electrical commodities is on the Increase, despite the fact that certain areas of the country such as Lancashire and South Wales, are still suffering from the depressed conditions of the staple industries in their respective areas&quot;.MOTOR INDUSTRY.SIR WILLIAM MORRIS reported that, generally speaking, business in the motor trade had been better this season than in 1908 undoubtedly owing to good weather.    Home trade was normal for the season.    Export prospects were brighter, although the fiercest competition prevailed both at home
MOTOR    INDUSTRY (CONTD.)and overseas, particularly from America.    He confirmed what Sir George Beharrell had said as to the unfairness of competition from America (see section on Rubber).    It could safely be said that America was exporting cars at a loss the whole time, and he did not think that was generally known to people in this country.    Their exports were so small in proportion to their output that they could afford to continue this policy.      America was also making enormous efforts to capture all types of aircraft business.    Over the past twelve months she had been buying u;i designs and patents and very large organisations were being formed in the States for the manufacture of all types of aircraft.    This certainly should not be lost sight of.With regard to his ovn business, he. had designed two separate models which had been built specially for overseas conditions and they had been received remarkably well in every part of the world.    He was therefore expecting better business in the export markets for 1930.SIR CYRIL HURCOMB wrote:-&quot;The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles) ne-7ly registered in June, 1929, was 2,572 more than in the corresponding period of 1928.    Cars taxed on horse power increased by 1,30^;    goods vehicles by 1,306 and motor hackneys by 180;    there was a decrease of 218 in &quot;other vehicles&quot;.    As regards motor cycles, the number registered in June, 1929, was 420 more than in June, 1928&quot;.COTTON.SIR KENNETH STK7ART remarked that orders for the export of cotton goods during July and August were rather scarce until the middle of August.    During July the tendeicy was for buyers to await the result of the wages issue in the hope that prices would be reduced to a considerable degree if the employers had their way.    Finally when the arbitration award was published, buyers abroad quite misunderstood the effect on finished prices; they could not understand a 6-1- per cent drop in wages which did not result in a 6-g- per cent drop in the final price of cotton goods.    As they did not get this they hesitated to buy.    In actual result, so far, the drop had been used to minimise losses sustained by manufacturers, and prices had altered very little.    During the last two weeks there had been more activity, Calcutta, Karachi and Bombay all participating.    The best time for delivery in these markets was from November to February and for that purpose they began buying now.    India, generally, promised better in the immediate future;      there had been an improvement in the political
COTTON  (CONTD.)situation, little or nothing being heard during the last two months of the non-co-operation movement, and also the publication of the Bureau iieport had helped to clear the air as to the size of the net crop of cotton.    The state of affairs in Afghanistan, on the other hand, was stopping trade via Karachi.In China, business was quiet on account of the low price of silver.    As far as the Chinese were concerned their prices were all reckoned in silver, and then silver went do*m, as it had lately, it caused an apparent rise in prices and resulted in making business exceedingly difficult. In South America there had not been much fresh business. Home trade was moderately busy on account of orders being placed for the spring trade.The Lancashire Cotton Corporation was progressing quite well so far as gaining the consent of shareholders and creditors was concerned, though legal matters were holding up the completion of the transfer of the mills.    At present 44 mills, comprising about 4,000,000 spindles, had consented to join and there were negotiations going on in the case of some 60 more.   That was, quite apart from those the Lancashire Cotton corporation had -turned down on account of the impossibility of making them economic units, and those that had definitely refused to join the combine.MR. HERBERT LEE said, vith reference to the recent dispute in the cotton industry, that there had been many articles in the press which stated that concerns abroad had been, in the meantime, taking.the orders which ought to have oome to thie country.    He did not think that was correct.    During the stoppage they had been able to keep all customers abroad supplied from the stocks which existed in the mills.    As a matter of fact, in the fine trade  he stocks were by no means exhausted, and, at any rate in the spinning section of the trade, were still far higher than they ought to be for economio working of the mills.   The prospects in the fine trade were slightly improved;    they had not taken orders enough to keep machinery going fully in that trade since about last March, but in the last week or two the orders had been better.MR. LENNOX LEE wrote&quot;Trade during August was almost entirely overshadowed by the strike of the employees against a reduction of wages.    The strike lasted for three ,weeks and work was resumed on August 19th on the basis of 6.4ft reduction on current wages.      The decision of the Arbitration Board appears to have resulted in a certain amount of disappointment, both among operatives and employers.    There has recently been a marked improvement in enquiries, but the ge aeral opinion appears to be that there is going to be a struggle over prices.     In the East most firms,
COTTON (OONTD).especially those spinning coarse counts, have benefited by the stoppage as it has enabled then to dispose of accumulated stocks.    In finer counts there has been a slight improvement and a steady trade is in progress. Prices are, however, still cut.    The first report of the Bureau on the condition of the American cotton crop came out on August 8th; it indicated a crop of 15,543,000 bales, exclusive of linters, as against 14,391,000 a year ago.&quot;During the latter part of August there has been considerable enquiry from Calcutta, for dhooties and other light cloths.    Some business has also been done with Bombay.    Egypt and the Levant have taken more interest in cloth and South America has also done slightly better.&quot;The Lancashire Cotton Corporation has announced several additional offers for mills under its combination scheme.    The Combined Egyptian iii 11s L*-d.    states that it has completed arrangements for the absorption of 14 companies.    The Combination now controls 5,000,000 spindles&quot;.WOOL.MR. ARTHUh SHA-V regretted he could not be optimistic about the 7/00I textile trade, which was going through its blackest period.    During the months of July and August, trade in the Bradford district had become gradually worse, with increased unemployment.    On the 38th August the persons who were signing the unemployment register in that district were 23 per cent of its full membership, a great proportion of whom -,7ere employed perhaps two or three days a week.    There was a great amount of uncertainty throughout the industry arising from the failure to arrive at an agreement in the wages discussions.    Buying appeared to be from hand to mouth, owing to the continued decline in the price of wool tops and yarns.    Taking the index of 100 for 1914, the following table gave the figures at four periods:-Wool. Tops. Yarns. Group.December, 1924. 227 231 229 329August, 1928. 153 159 170 161January, 1929. 142 144 158 148August,  1929. 110 120 140 123Mr. Shaw considered it to be of the utmost importance that note should be taken of the prices of wool and, in his opinion, their effect on employment throughout the industry.    Thus the price of wool had dropped from 153 last year to 110 now, and it was well known that the effect of this was that manufacturers simply waited until they had an order before they started manufacture at all.    If stability of prices could be reached at any stage, it would be a great help to the industry as a whole.
WOOL  (CONTD,),In the Huddersfield district there had been a slight increase in the light worsted trade and orders for tweeds appeared to be better.   The numbers in this section signing the unemployment register were 17$ in August as against 20% in July,    In the Halifax district there had been some Improvement in worsted yarns, but little improvement in the machine activity.^.For the first time in the past twelve months trade in the heavy woollen district had shown a decided improvement over the other districts and the improvement had been steady for a period of three months.    In particular, the increase in orders for tweeds had improved employment throughout the district. The average unemployment figure during July and August was 13 per cent against the average of 20 per cent.during the same period of last year.During the month of August practically throughout the whole of the Yorkshire district the annual holidays had had some effect on general trading, but the outstanding feature was the wages problem.   At the moment the position appeared to be very critical and the trade unions awaited the decision of the employers who, it was understood, were taking a ballot vote on the question of a general lockout.   The unions had expressed their willingness to continue the negotiations and, failing agreement, were prepared to allow the whole question to be referred to an arbitration court.    It was expected that the employers&apos; decision would be reached that week-end and there appeared to be very grave danger of a general stoppage in the industry.    So far as he had been able to ascertain, there was a feeling among the employers - though there might not be unanimity in this matter - that they were not prepared to allow any outsiders to intervene, because they felt they were strong enough to force the lockout.   The unions for their part, whilst willing to negotiate, strongly resented any-forced tactics on the part of the employers.      He felt zurtaln    that in the event of employers taking that attitude, there was bound to be a stoppage throughout the whole of the Industry, perhaps at the end of the following week.SIR FREDERIC AYKROYD wrote:-&quot;Since our meeting In July we have had the usual annual holidays in the various districts of the West Riding.    These have fitted in well with the state of trade for, taking the position all round, never has business been much worse.    Not-withstanding the fact that purchases of raw material were made towards the close of the last importing season and prices were at the lowest, business has not been forthcoming to absorb these supplies and we have had one continual fall in values since March.   One cannot say that this position has yet been arrested for the financial difficulties and the very poor demand for tops, yams,   and piece goods from abroad leaves us with a very uncertain outlook.&quot;Our cost of production is so high as to render It impossible to run either the spinning mill or the weaving factory except on very serious and speculative lines.     The
WOOL (CONTD.) .woollen trade in Calverley, Stanningley, Dewsbury and Batley is slightly better than it was, more machinery is running than a month ago - approximately 90%.   This end of the trade at the moment is the best.    In Guiseley and Yeadon the position is very irregular, some firms being moderately ^well employed, others very badly employed, approximately 15% of the machinery running.    It is to be noted that firms who specialise in Government orders are all on the quiet side. &apos; In the worsted section of the trade, combing remains bad with only 60% of the machinery running.    In the spinning, the white spinners are very badly placed, 65/10% of the machinery running.   Coloured spinners are better than a month ago with 90% running.   Amongst the manufacturers, those engaged in specialities in fine goods, are well employed, but the ordinary run of business in this line,  in the dress goods trade, Is&apos; extremely bad.    Mens&apos; wear is slightly better.&quot;Summing up, It should be noted, that firms who are moderately well running have obtained this position more by successful speculation than by actual business that they have been able to win through real demand.&quot;LACE AND HOSIERY.MR WALKER read a letter from a correspondent in Hinckley regarding the position of the hosiery trade there, which was characteristic   of the trade as a whole.   His report said that the state of business was by no means good, though there were a few firms on full time.    There was a general lack of confidence In the trade.   An enormous amount of manufactured lisle hose had been- imported into this country early in the year.   There had been a growing tendency on the part of the wholesale houses to increase their first orders for these goods, rather than to place an order and give a repeat.   This used up a buyer&apos;s allotted capital, which was strictly rationed, with the result that he was not in a position to buy to any extent from an English house until he had cleared his foreign stocks.    In regard to the future, a definite improvement in the hosiery tre.de would come with colder weather.MR, MITCHELL said that reports from Nottingham pointed to a satisfactory Autumn season.   Coloured laces were a little less in evidence, although fair business was looked for.    Generally the prospects were quite good for those manufacturers producing up-to-date novelty goods.   The Overseas Dominions continued to be our best customers and it was with regret that a further decline had to be recorded in our exports to the United States of America and South America.    The m03t notable increase was in Australia, into which market British lace was admitted free of duty.The hosiery trade was quiet at the present time, which was the normal condition at this season of the year.    Summer underwear had sold well and the short stocks left should
CONFIDENTIAL. LACE AND HOSIERY (CONTD.) .make the prospects for next summer quite bright.   Deliveries of winter underwear were now commencing and, apart from unforeseen circumstances, the autumn season promised to be a good one.   Very large quantities of foreign goods still continued to enter    this       country and competition was becoming keener.   The export trade showed indications of improvementsj good orders had been received for fancy cashmere half hose and deliveries were now being made in those goods for the United States of America, Canada, Denmark and Sweden.    New Zealand and South Africa were sending normal enquiries and orders.CHEMICALS.MR. HILL observed that the home trade had remained surprisingly good, notwithstanding the holiday season and other adverse influences and depression in several of the chemical consuming industries.    For Instance, although the galvanising and tin-plating industries had been depressed, the demand for mineral acids used in those industries had actually improved.    The trade in the chemicals used in the textile industries had also been maintained.   Dye production was steadily increasing and the position there was satis-factory.   The fertiliser position was also good considering the time of the year.    Fine chemicals had been quiet for some considerable time past, with the exception of photo-graphic chemicals in which there had been a steady increase. The export trade in &quot;Chemicals, drugs, dyes and colours&quot; for July showed a slight advance over 1928 and the imports had also slightly increased.   The exports for the first seven months of 1929 were just  100 , 000 over the 1928 figures and the Imports showed an increase of  300,000.Some time ago he had reported to the Council that Imperial Chemical Industries had set up a plant for the production of synthetic methyl alcohol, which was the basis of a whole group of important products j    that plant was now working satisfactorily and was meeting practically the whole of the home demand.    The erection of a plant for the produc-tion of synthetic acetic acid was also making good progress. Rationalisation continued to make headway within the chemical industry and mention might be made of the recent amalgama-tions which had taken place in the tar distilling plants of Scotland and Lancashire with the formation of Scottish Tar Distillers and Lancashire Tar Distillers respectively.    In the fertiliser trade, Scottish Agricultural Industries Ltd., a company closely connect ed   with Imperial Chemical Industries, had absorbed further concerns.A point, which Sir D.Milne Watson had not mentioned and on which he wished to touch, had regard to the use of creosote as a preservative of wood.    If railway sleepers were made of steel and concrete instead of wood, there would be an increased
C0NFID2NTIAL.CHEIvlICALS   (C GNTD. ).production of steel and that would mean an Increased, production - of creosote from the -coke-oven tar; but the lack of outlets for the^creosote would decrease the value of the tar and that would have some effect on the price of coal and the cost of steel.     The gas works would similarly be affected.     That showed how those industries were economically linked up.   hMr. Hill handed in the following note regarding the German chemical industry.&quot;The annual report of the Association of German Chemical Manufacturers provides clear indication that the chemical industry is comparatively free from the influences of industrial depressions and crises.     According to statistics published by this body, the level of prosperity in the German chemical industry during the last four years has been as follows:-1925.        1926.      1927.      192B.% age of chemicals concerns unable to pay dividends .......    70$ 55.8%     28.9$     20.5%Average dividends, including the Dye Trust and artificial silk industries ...............     6.6$       6.6%       9.4%       9.9%Average dividends, not in-cluding the Dye Trust and artificial silk industries  ____     3.1%       3.7%       6.8%       7.1%&quot;The importance which export trade bears to the welfare of the German chemical Industry may be seen from the following export figures:-Value of Exports. 1925. 1926. 1927. 1928.RM.        937,000,000    1,020,000,000    1,162,000,000   1,318,000,000&quot;The Increase in exports of German chemicals continued In the present year.     During the first six months of 1929 exports were valued at RM. 709,OCC,CO0 compared with RM 623,000,000 in the same period of 1928,&quot;GAS    INDUSTRY.SIR DAVID MILNE WATSON reported that, owing to the fine season there had been a very good demand for tar for roadmaking purposes.     There were, however, far too many local authorities using Imported   bitumen,    for   which   he   did   not
CONFIDENTIAL. 3 AS INDUSTRY (CONTD.),think there was any good reason.   The position with regard to creosote wae one of great difficulty.    Stocks were now x     very large and there did. not seem much chance of reduction, as the United States was still strictly limiting the amount of creosote that might be imported.    Efforts were being made to find new markets, but that was not easy.    Recently the Admiralty had been approached with a view to their using creosote for fuel purposes and,though nothing definite had yet been arranged, he hoped that, as very considerable quantities of creosote were used by the Navy during the war, they might bo induced to start using this home fuel once more.    In regard to pitch,  the market was stronger, owing to an improved demand from abroad for briquetting purposes and there had been a slight advance in   price, which was very welcome in view of the poor markets for other residuals,A further fall in price of sulphate of ammonia had taken place and the price was now down to  7.l?,.Od a ton. This was the lowest price ever charged for sulphate.    It was unnecessary to point out how very serious this was both for the gas Industry and the collieries, because whereas the gas industry previously made a little profit out of the sale of sulphate,  it was now actually making a loss and that was simply a charge against the manufacture of gas.    The roason was that so many foreign countries had oommenced synthetic manufacture, not merely for fertilising, but to have a home supply in case of. war.    It was therefore very difficult to do anything to stop the Increase in the number of synthetic plants put up all over the world.In regard to the manufacture of gas itself, the South Yorkshire oollieries had produced a scheme for a grid for the distribution of gas.    It was not his intention to orlticise the soheme, .but he thought it should be submitted, in the first instance, to the committee presided over by Sir Alexander Walker.    That Oommittee was set up by the Board of Trade for the special purpose of investigating the possibilities of a gas grid, and was at the present time investigating the whole question.    It would therefore be well, before coming to any conclusion in regard to the South Yorkshire sohems, that it should he submitted to Sir Alexander Walker&apos;s committee for investigation and report.RUBBER.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL stated that the home market in the tyre industry showed little change as compared with last year.    The fine weather had produced more motoring and sales were up to a small extent, but, owing to the longer wear of tyres this year, tho increase in the sales was not proportionate to the extension of motoring.    Export trade was very difficult!    there was a slight increase, but it
RUBBER (OONTD.).was in the face of the fiercest competition.    This composition was mainly from the United States of America, and their export market was so small compared with their home market that their manufacturers could afford to make big losses abroad, which would still have no effect on their general balance sheet.    It was really a policy of dumping.   The export of tyres from America did not represent more than seven or eight per cent, of their production, ?/hile in this country our exports reprersented more than one-third of our production.      In the case of motor cars the proportion of American output exported would be even less than seven per oent.     The export tyre trade was also severely handicapped by the tremendous percentage of foreign oars at present overseas and no one welcomed more than the rubber industry the efforts which were being made by Sir William Morris and others to rectify that situation. A great deal of our overseas trade hung on the ability of the motor and tyre industries to establish themselves more firmly in overseas markets.    Sir George had travelled abroad a great deal in the last twelve months and his experience was that people abroad tended to buy goods other than cars .and tyres from America, when they saw suoh a big preponderance of American cars and tyres coming to their country.     Anything, therefore, that could be done to develop the export trade of oars and tyres would be of great benefit to our export trade generally.As far as sports goods were concerned the season had been very good owing to the favourable weather.     Mechanical rubber goods had been affected by the stoppage in the cotton trade, but the outlook was certainly more promising and orders for the heavier classes were coming forward on a greater scale.     Heels and soles and boots and shoes were more or less seasonal.      Last winter was abnormally dry; there had been an abnormally dry summer and that branch of the industry, as well as the textile part of the industry, which mads mackintoshes, had had a bad time.The market for ebonite was improving, especially for wireless equipment, as the winter season approached.      In regard to surgical goods the market was steady and the preference for British Burgical goods was more marked than ever.     *   There was severe competition from the Continent, but in the highest class goods the British makerb certainly more than held their own.Speaking of the rubber industry generally, this time of the year was usually a period of short time, but the amount of short time this year was considerably less than usual.       So that taking u/5ths full time as normal at this period of the year, the average today was probe,bly 4/Cths of full time throughout the industry and that was very gratifying.
FINANCE.LORD BRADBURY observed that the situation in the money market since the middle of June had been dominated by persistent weakness of the exchanges in one direction or another and by continued loss of gold.    By the 3rd July the Bank of England&apos;a gold reserve had already fallen to  155,000,000,  only  5,000,000 above the figure of  150,000,000 which the Cunliffe Committee regarded as the normal minimum under post-war conditions.      There was a good deal of misapprehensidn as to that  150&apos;,000,000.      The figure was introduced by the Cunliffe Committee for the purpose of arriving at a total for the fiduciary issue.    The Cunliffe Committee recommended that, after some experience had been gained of the working of a free market for gold, the figure of  150,000,000 as a gold reserve should be worked to and then the fiduciary iesue allowed to assume its normal level with that gold reserve.    Owing to various abnormal conditions,   that idea oould not be worked out completely and the fiduciary issue had had to be settled before stable conditions had been obtained and therefore it was quite possible that, with our present fiduciary issue,  150,000,000 gold reserve did not reprosent equilibrium.   We should ultimately find the equilibrium point, which might be above or belowj    personally he thought it would be below, and If it was thought desirable on general grounds that we should have  150,000,000,  then the time would come to reduce the fiduolary Issue to get to that point, but he did not attach serious importance at the present time to the  150,000,000 figure.    It would be satisfactory if we could get to an equilibrium of the exchanges with a gold reserve of  120,000,000.    What was serious was the question of ebb and flow.By the end of August the gold reserve had further fallen to  136,000,000, without any change having been made in the Bank Rate.Most of the gold lost during July and August went to France.    There had been and still were large &quot;French, balances in London and it appeared that the French banks took advantage of a weak sterling exchange, which had fallen below gold point, to transfer part of these balances in gold to Paris,    an operation which would not in these circumstances have any compensating effect upon the Paris exchange, which in fact remained weak throughout.The narrowing of the basis of credit that would normally have resulted from the loss of gold had been diminished by reason of the Bank of England having bought securities on a considerable scale.    Government securities in the Bank Return of June 12th,  just before the gold drain started, stood at  36,000,000.      On the 4th September they were nearly  76,000,000, an increase of  40,000,000 compared with a net loss of gold amounting to  28,000,000 in tho same period.    How far this may have been the result of deliberate policy on the part of the Bank of England, having regard to the spocial causes of the gold drain, and how far  it may have been due to the unwillingness of the market to take
FINANCE (CONTD..) .up Treasury Bills to cover those maturing, he was not in a position to express an opinion, but the fact remained that operation of the old drastio remedies which the traditional gold standard provided for an outflow of gold, had on this occasion - doubtless for excellent reasons - been somewhat inhibited.The uncomfortable position that the money market found itself in was aggravated by a sudden unexpected increase in the New York Federal Reserve Rate from 5 per cent, to 6 per cent, on the 8tb AugUBtr     This became known in London on the following day, which was a Friday, and caused an almost complete suspension of activity until the Bank of England announced that no immediate increase in Bank Rate was contemplated.     The Bill Market had been living under constant fear of a rise in Bank Rate and the Three Months&apos; Bill Rate had naturally been firmly maintained at or about Bank Rate,     The gilt edged market had been depressed and business in the Stock Exchange generally had been restricted.The exchange position remained very precarious.    The three principal exchanges, New York, Paris and Berlin were all close to the export gold point and further losses of gold seemed to be threatened.     Incidentally the Bank of England had seoured a quarter of a million of gold on the previous day rather unexpectedly, which was an element favourable to the situation.The July statements of the English Clearing Banks showed (compared with June) a rise of  8,000,000 in deposits, in spite of a shrinkage of nearly  9,000,000 in bank oash.    Advances rose by  8,000,000 to  985,000,000 compared with deposits totalling  1,778,000,000 showing a proportion of 55 per cent.GENERAL TRADE.MR. MITCHELL observed that reports received by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce shewed that in Liverpool conditions In the Imported meat trade in August had been almost as bad as any previously experienced. Chilled values had been fairly well maintained, but with difficulty; other sections had been slow and had lost ground.    The supplies of Irish cattle during the month of August had been heavier, with a consequent reduction in values.   The demand for beef had only boon medium.    It was believed that this was due to the general conditions of trade in Lancashire and the Liverpool district.August had been a slack month for business in hides and there had not been much improvement in tho home demand for leather, but several tanners making sole leather such as was wanted in Russia had sold considerable quantities for shipment to that country.    English tanners, generally speaking, were working their yards on a reduced scale; this had been going on for some time, but an improved condition of affairs was generally expected in the month now opening.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).The hide market was getting most of its support from America and Russia and as long as thi3 continued English tanners would probably buy oautiously, as the present value of leather here did not leave a manufacturing profit on tho current price of hides.MR. LENNOX LEE sent the following statement&quot;The monetary situation has continued to be a serious obstacle to business expansion in so far as it has dis-couraged new enterprises and capital Issues and programmes of development generally.&quot;The Improved tone in the coal industry has been maintained and the autumn demand promises to be brisk in nearly all markets.    Demand for Welsh coal has been well up to the average.   West Riding export trade remains firm.    In the North East Coast there have been heavy .bookings of coking coal.   Pits in the Derbyshire and South Yorkshire districts are to be re-opened to supply the strong demand for coke slaok.    Business in iron and steelhas been fairly quiet during the holiday season, but with a firm undertone.    There are no stocks of pig iron and various idle furnaces have been re-started.    During August 18 vessels,  totalling 48,814 tons have been launched in the Clyde area whilst the output for Scotland was 57,734 tons.   Export orders for textile machinery have been well maintained.   Maohine tool makers have received a fair amount of enquiries from both home and overseas markets.    Locomotive builders have done a steady business and electrical engineers have&quot; also been well employed.    The demand for outlery and plate has heen rather below the usual level.    In the heavy trades orders are said to have been good.    There has been a distinct improvement in railway requirements for home trade, although the overseas trade is very quiet.&quot;As regards the wool industry there has been a slight improvement in employment in Huddersfield, Halifax and Dewsbiry although this has been offset by Increased unemployment in Bradford.    The improvement in Dewsbury is said to be due to a reduotion in wages which has enabled employers to compete with foreign manufacturers.    Taken as a whole, however, business has been decidedly depressed, particularly in the Bradford dress goods trade.    The wages question is having a strangling effect upon business.    Negotiations have broken down and a waiting polioy is being pursued.    In the raw material market there ia hesitancy on the part of buyers to cover their requirements for any considerable distance ahead.&quot;The accumulation of orders following the holiday season will ensure active business for some time in the boot and shoe trade.    The value of the July exports of men&apos;s footwear shows a slight improvement on that for the same period last year.&quot;
GENERAL TRADE    (CONTD).Co-operative T,7holesale Society.MR. HAYKURST reported that the total sales during the past month had shown an Increase both In value and in bulk. It was gratifying to find that the two districts, the North East Coast and South &quot;Jales, which had been affected most by trade depression had considerably improved.      In the banking section, Individual deposits and the number of depositors were still Increasing.     The statistics for the Society&apos;s half year ended July last showed sales of  43^ million, an increase of half a million over the correspond-Ing period of last year.     The Scottish Co-operative Whole-sale Society, whose accounts were kept separate from those of his own organisation, had nearly a ten million trade, and were up a quarter of a million over last year.Trade with Russia continued to be of a satisfactory character.     For the past twelve months it had reached nearly three quarters of a million sterling and In addition they had done a large business in tea.     In this connection they had given a floating credit of over  400,000and every obligation had up till now been met.     The long credits the Russian Government required in some cases were almost impossible for manufacturers to find, but If credits could be guaranteed, it would help, considerably, particular-ly In the cotton and wool trades.     The Co-operative Wholesale Society had had transactions with Russia on a basis of 25 per cent cash and six months&apos; bills.     Up to those periods the Society had charged a reasonable rate of Interest, but the Russians had been exploited in Germany to the extent of 12-g- to 15 per cent.     The opportunity, therefore, for this country to trade with Russia was considerable.DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES. SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE   wrote&quot;The figures to hand for the months of July and August do not seem to bear out the opinions on the condition   of trade which were being expressed while they were in progress.     July, of course, covers the period of extreme pressure represented by the half-yearly sales, followed by the usual interval of stock-taking and quiet business during August.     The outstanding feature of the first five months of the half year which ended with July was probably the difficulty which most distributive firms have found in maintaining their previous year&apos;s figures.     The sales, however, appear to have been extremely successful almost everywhere, and record figures are reported from several parts of the country.     This probably gave rise to the impression that July trade had been good generally, but the reports to hand show that once more most firms have found it difficult to maintain their figures, and the truth probably is that the situation was saved by the general
DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES  (CONTD. )success of the sales.     There was the fear that August vrhich, apart from the holiday centres, is always a quiet month, would this year be quieter than usual, as the view was frequently expressed that Overseas visitors were not present in quite the same volume, nor did they represent the same spending power as In previous years.     Again, the continuance of fine summer weather late into August has made it difficult to arouse any interest in Autumn fashions, while, generally speaking, most of the summer purchases had been completed before the Bank Holiday. Once more, hovjever, the figures seem to disprove this impression, and the reports to hand show that many firms have Improved substantially on last year&apos;s figures, and generally have done much better than was anticipated.&quot;The Northern districts are an exception to these remarks, where, owing to labour troubles either imminent or in operation, combined with the depression in the Yorkshire woollen trade, July and August have been very difficult months.     From that quarter the reports to hand are generally of an unfavourable character.&quot;One encouraging feature is the return of a more optimistic feeling in South Wales, where the distributive trades have been peculiarly hard hit by the results of the General Strike and the disturbances which followed it.     The returns to hand show that, trade in that area seems to have taken a definite turn for the better, and there are reasons for believing that this improvement will gather greater force from October onwards.&quot;AIR ALEXANDER SHAW sent the following figures:-INDEX NUMBER OF SHIPPING FREIGHTS.TONNAGE LAID UP at the principal ports of Great Britain and Ireland.SHIPPING.1920 as 100.1913 . 100August, 1929 .

RAILWAY TRAFFIC  (CONTD.).sir CYRIL .HUROOMB   sent the following statement:-&quot;There was a substantial improvement in the freight traln^ reoeipts of the four amalgamated railway companies during the nine weeks ended 1st September, 1929, but the decrease in passenger train traffic continued.

EMPLOYMENT.MR.&quot; PHILLIPS reported that, since the end of July the unemployment figures had not shown much change from a total of 1,150,000 or 1,160,000.    In the last four weeks, however, there had been a slight drop each week.    Taking the separate divisions, there had been during August a substantial drop in the Midlands, in the North East and in Wales, and a considerable increase in the North Western division.    The only industry for which he had separate figures for a recent date was coal.    On the 26th August the number recorded as unemployed was 173,976, as compared with 305,003 on the 22nd July, a fall of about 29,000 or 2.6 per cent.    AlmoBt the whole of the fall was under the heading of persons temporarily stopped.The average live register during August was 1,162,051.

AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON observed that he had reoently returned from Australia where he had visited all the States exoept Tasmania and the Northern territory.   It was five years since his previous visit and he thought it might be of interest to record some of the developments during that period.   Particularly striking had been the development of the industries producing wool and wheat.    Industrial and scientific research had been intensified during the last five years and some of the results were beginning to bo shown In the Inoreased yields of wheat and quantities of sheep and wool grown.   Of oourse, there had been a distinct rise in the price of land, both In the townB and in the country and many people thought that the highest level had boen reached and that there was a probability of a reduction in the price of land to correspond with the reduced prices and increased costs of primary products. The problem in Australia at present was the reduotion of costs and that was receiving very close attention by all those concerned.    There had been another very marked alteration in the realm of finance, the borrowings of the different States being now regulated by the Loan Council and sinking funds having been instituted and various other alterations and improvements made,    Tho question of central banking was also one which had&quot; been occupying some attention, although no conclusion had yet been reached.A great development had taken place in. secondary industries.    In regard to industrial conditions generally, there had been one or t,wo rather serious strikes, outstanding instances being those of the waterside workers and the coal and timber workers.   The waterside workers&apos; trouble had been brought to an end, although of course there were certain troubles still remaining.    Tho ooal strike was still going onj    a commission was investigating various questions connected with the industry, but at tho present time no conclusion had been reached.    As regards the timber workers, the dispute was in an acute stage when he was in Australia but at the present time, altnough there was still trouble in New South Wales, he believed that work was progressing in all the States.As Members of the Council would have 3een in the papers, a Federal political crisis had arisen ovor the Arbitration question.   The position was that great difficulties had been experienced in the past because of the different awards;    an attempt had been made by a referendum to confine all Arbitration Court legislation to the Federal Government, but that referendum had resulted in the rejection of tho proposal.Dealing with some of the individual items of Information which he had received by cable, Mr.Sanderson said that the value of the 1938/29 wool clip was  70,000,OX and the number of sheep in the Commonwealth was approxl-mately 106 millions, which was the highest point reaohed since 1891.    The wool season this year had opened with a
CONFIDENTIAL, AUSTRALIAN TRADE (OONTD.).very considerable reduction In prices ranging from about 25 to 33 per cent, from last year&apos;s prices, and of course, that was a^very serious matter for the Commonwealth,The wheat exports were 76 million bushels compared with 46 million last year.    The export of flour was 425,000 tons as compared with 319,000 tons last year. Imports of all goods into the Commonwealth for the year ending 30th June last were  143 millions and the exports  144 millions, being a decrease of four millions and an increase of a million and a half respectively on the previous year.The bank clearances from the 1st January to the 2nd September were in Sydney  705 millions and Melbourne  547 millions, an increase of  18 millions and  40 millions respectively.      In the field of industrial operations, Imperial Chemical Industries were contemplating erecting a new fertiliser factory for Bulphate of ammonia at a cost of  2 millions.    Owing to the ohange In the Queensland Government there was a general disposal of all Government Industrial enterprises in that State.INDIAN TRADE.MR. GREEN remarked that the latest Indian seaborne trade figures presented one interesting feature, that while imports of gold and silver had declined, imports of merchandise had expanded.    There was a possible connection between the two facts.      During the four months ending 31st July, 1929,  Imports of merchandise were valued at  61 million, a figure nearly two per cent, higher than that for the corresponding period of the previous year.     Exports, on the other hand, at  80 million v/ere nearly three and a half per cent, lower. Net imports of gold and sliver, at rather over  7 million were nearly  3 million less than in tho previous year. The visible balance of tre.de In favour of India during these four months was more than  12 million.The monsoon had on the whole been satisfactory hitherto and the preliminary crop forecasts which were now appearing were encouraging.    Thus the first cotton fore-cast showed an acreage 4-g- per cent, above last year*s first forecast.    The ground nut figures were 7 per cent, up and the sesamum figures 3 per cent, up.   There was however a 6 per cent, decrease in the estimated area under sugar. This presumably was not unconnected with the low world prices of sugar.    In parts of India agricultural prospects were obscure owing to floods.    In particular, the bursting of the ice dam on the Shyok river, followed by unusually heavy rains in the North West Frontier Province, Baluchistan and Sind, had caused enormous rises in the Punjab rivers and the Indus,  and vast areas had been inundated.
INDIAN TRADE (QONTP).Pears had been entertained for the safety of the  Sukkur Barrage works , but it appeared that no serious damage had been done to them. Many villages had had to be evacuated and the immediate losses to agriculturists had obviously been great.    It remained to be seen, ho-/ever, whether some of the loss could not be recouped by the sowing of winter crops when the floods receded.The labour troubles both in Bombay and Calcutta were abating.    All the cotton mills in Bombay were now working, except a few whose finances were unsatisfactory and which were likely to go Into liquidation.    Similarly, most of the Calcutta jute mills had resumed work, the men being satisfied with the masters&apos; terms when fully explained to them.COLONIAL TRADE.MR. VERNON said that the sugar position was causing rather acute anxiety.    Trinidad had a record sugar crop which was mainly due not to the actual quantity produced, but to the unusual richness of the carie and its high purity.    On the other hand the prices at which sugar was being sold at present were less than the cost of production either in the West Indies or Mauritius, and the reason for this was no longer the competition of beet sugar, but the very large output of cane sugar mainly from Cuba.    The Secretary of State for the Colonies had just appointed a Commission to investigate and report on the sugar industry in the West Indies and British Guiana.    Lord Olivier and Mr. Semple were the Commissioners and they would be leaving England almost immediately to undertake the enquiry in the West Indies.Statistical reports of the Kenya and Uganda Jlailway showed an increase both in export and import traffic.    Import traffic was nearly one per cent and export traffic five per cent greater in the first four months of this year than in the same period last year, while there was an increase of nearly six per cent in the total train mileage run&apos;.    Figures received from Uganda indicated that there would probably be a record cotton crop in that country.    Tanganyika figures of exports for domestic produce showed an increase for the first five months of the year from  1,117,000 in 1928 to  1,244,000 in 1929 and one of the principal items of increase was cotton.    In Northern Rhodesia there was a large increase in mineral production,  520,000 in the first six months of this year as compared with  383,000 in the corresponding period of last year.Cyprus trade figures were small, but very satisfactory! there had been a large increase,  100,000, in the value of imports into the colony for the first seven months of this year and an increase of  150,000 in the value of exports.The rubber figures from British Malaya showed for July an export of 46,000 tons as compared with 40,000 in June and 50,000 in July, 1928, and for the first seven months of this year the gross exports were 330,000 tons as compared with 184,000 for the first seven months of last year.    Generally speaking, therefore, the result of the removal of restriction
COLONIAL TRADE (C ON TP ) .had certainly been, in the case of British Malaya, a large increase in production.     The Federated Malay States tin output figures also showed considerable increase over both the preceding years; for the first seven months of this year they reached 38/00C tons as compared with 35,000 tons last year and 29,000 the year before.     The figures of imports Into British Malaya, showing the countries of origin, had now been received.     The principal items of interest were cement, which amounted to 2g million States dollars, nearly all of which came from the United Kingdom; and electrical goods which amounted to nearly three million dollars, of which 546,000 dollars came from the United Kingdom, 1,972,000 from Holland and 269,000 from the United States.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE. (See also section on British Mission to South America).MR. HOSE remarked that the situation in the Argentine was becoming very serious as a result of the prolonged drought, which would cause the crops to be very much smaller than they were last year.     Already they had had to suspend ploughing and there was less area under cultivation, but in other respects the Argentine position continued to be as favourable as It was before.     There was a diminution In the imported articles, but the present prices of cereals had advanced slightly and that had acted as a counter to it. There had been labour troubles, particularly In Rosaria, but they had not spread to other ports and had subsided quickly.In Chile the situation continued to be good.     The question of synthetics which had been touched on in connec-tlon with sulphate of ammonia (see section on Gas Industry) was not causing harm in Chile because of the arrangements that had been made with the manufacturers of synthetics in other countries and those concerned in natural nitrate for the percentage of supplies to be allotted to each class of article.     That agreement was working quite well.     The imports into Chile for the first five months of this year were 621 million pesos as compared with 464 million pesos last year, and the exports for the same period were 1,119 million pesos as against 868 million last year, so there was a condition of reasonably good prosperity In the country. The sound position of the Chilean finances had enabled them to go ahead with public works construction.     This was nearly always paid for by a new loan and a loan of a million pounds was raised in Switzerland and Holland in the summer for that purpose.Mr. Hose handed in the following report regarding the situation in other South American countries :-
CONFIDENTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (OONTD.).&quot;Conservative estimates of the crop of cotton in Peru ^this year place the total yield at around 1,010,000 quintals, whioh would be approximately 100,000 quintals less than last year.    In the local market, buyers have not shown much interest, but it is noteworthy that many of the estates In the Republic previously devoted to the cultivation of sugar are now under preparation for the planting of cotton.    The local market for sugar at the present time is very quiet, and dull in tone.    It is significant of the growing importance of native manufacturing industries In the Latin Amerioan Republics that the local manufacture of hosiery in Peru is being steadily extended, and fresh companies are being formed from time to time for the development of the industry.&quot;in Colombia, the downward trend of prices of coffee and the restricted demand for the commodity&quot;is causing increasing anxiety among the producers and the public in general.    With regard to the general commercial situation, the demand for merchandise outside Bogota has shown some improvement.    It has been found possible, as from 1st August last, to reduce the re-discount rate of the central bank of the Republic from 8 to 7 per cent., but it is to be feared that the difficult commercial and credit situation which necessitated the previous advance has not been such as to permit of rapid recovery, and it is to be presumed that curtailment of Imports must be a feature of Colombian conditions for some considerable time in the future.&quot;The current coffee crop in Venezuela is estimated at some 1,000,000 bags, but prospects&quot; for the next harvest indicate that there will then be an appreciably reduced output.    Meanwhile, the yield of the cocoa crop has been below average, having been a complete failure in some districts.    Seasonal dulness in business continues through-out Venezuela, with the result that wholesalers are oarrying large stocks of merchandise.   Prospects for the coming coffee crop in Nicaragua continue to be extremely promising. Tho tone of the local market for the commodity, however, has been adversely affected by the generally easier tendency in coffee prices in New York and in the other foroign markets.    Weather conditions in Guatemala continue favourable for the growing coffee crop, a period&quot;&quot;of two weeks without rain having been very opportunely experienced. In contrast, however,  to the position at this time last year, there is little demand from Europe and other consuming markets for shipments.    Owing to the incidence of the customary annual holidays in Salvador,  extending over a fortnight and terminating on 5th July, there was an influx of visitors from the provincial areas,  and general trade conditions in San Salvador consequently became more active. Otherwise, the underlying tone of the commercial markets in the Republic has been quiet, merchants being disposed to restrict their orders to their immediate requirements. In Eouador, there has as yet been no appreciable Improvement from the depressed commercial situation which has been in evidence for a considerable tine p&amp;6t&quot;.
