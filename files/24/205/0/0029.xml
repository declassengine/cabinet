[This Document is the Property of. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1929. -SECRET.CP. 229 (29).CABINET.Hunger strike of certain of the accused in the LahoreConspiracy Case.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of two telegrams from the Government of India, the second of which indicates the possibility that of two of the accused in the Lahore conspiracy trial (not the Meernt conspiracy trial), who are hunger striking, one at any rate is not unlikely to die as the result. It will be seen that the Local Government and the Government of India anticipate that the death of either or both of these men would lead to considerable local excitement, which, of course, might have to be put down by force. It is not impossible, too, that a certain amount of agitation may be excited amongst certain elements in this country either by the death of one or both of these two men, or, more particularly, by any forcible suppression of the trouble that is feared in the Punjab.I shoiild like my colleagues clearly to understand that these two men, Bhagat Singh and Dutt, have already been convicted of attempted lmirder by throwing a bomb and fixing revolvers in the Legislative Assembly at Delhi. They are now again under trial on a charge of being concerned in a murderous conspiracy, of which their attempt in the Legislative Assembly was one incident and the murder of a police officer, Mr. Saunders, and an Indian police sergeant was another. I consider, and I trust that my colleagues will agree with me, that the decision, of the Punjab Govern-ment aod Government of India in regard to the hunger strikers is justified.India Office, W. B.22nd July 1929.Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of Stale,dated 6th Jidy l&apos;.J29.2150 S. Home Department. A recent feature of the extreme side of political agitation is the public glorification of Bhagat Singh aud Dutt, the two couvicts iu the Delhi Assembly bombing case. There was from the first a tendency iu certain quarters to regard them as patriots and martyrs, and this was encouraged . by their line of defence, which was that their action had been in the nature of a demonstration and a warning. Their written defence statement was an elaborate justification of their act, which they described as marking &quot; the end of the era of Utopian non-violence,&quot; and a prophecy of the advent of an era of revolution. Public meetings were held to congratulate them on their convictions, and on 19th Jime two such meetings were held at Lahore and Amritsar under the auspices of the Nau Jawan Bharat Sabha.&apos;:;:&quot; At these meetings the general trend of the speeches was to eulogise Bhagat Singh and Dutt and to exhort youths to follow their example.Subsequently the two convicts went on hunger strike, on the pretext that their object was to improve the treatment of political prisoners. It is uncertain whether Bhagat Singh is now abstaining from food, but Dutt is still on hunger strike. The object is most probably to attract popular sympathy. In this they appear to have succeeded ; and a meeting of congratulation and sympathy, which was well attended, was held at Amritsar on 30th J une under the joint auspices of the Provincial Congress Committee and the Nau Jawan Bharat Sabha. The meeting was also made the occasion to present an address of welcome to Mota Singh on his release from jail.Mota Singh is a dangerous revolutionary who was sentenced in 19221 to various terms of imprisonment on charges of sedition. He was at that time imbued with communist doctrines, was an open advocate of violence, aud was believed to have taken a considerable part in inspiring the Babbar Akali outrage. The speeches at this meeting were very inflammatory and contained direct incitements to violence. There was open praise of Bhagat Singh and Dutt, and their portraits were distributed to members of the audience with copies of their statement made in court to which3809       75    7.29
reference has been made above. One speaker said that young men would have to change their policy and to shed their blood fox- the sake of their nation and to begin Avar on new lines. The Babbar Akalis were praised and Mota Singh, in referring to Bhagat Singh and Dutt, said that lovers of their country never remain within the limits of the law. A long time a feature of this and similar meetings was the shouting by some members of the audience of &quot;Long live. Revolution &quot; and &quot;Down with Imperialism.&quot;We are awaiting the views of the Punjab Government.* A Punjab society of highly objectionable tendencies.i He bad previously been sentenced to transportation for life but was &quot; amnestied &quot; in 1920.-vTelegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of Statefor India, dated 18th July 1929.2250 S. Home Department. Will you please refer to our telegram of the 6th July, 2150 S., relating to certain political prisoners in the Punjab. On the 15th July a Conference was held at &quot;Viceregal Lodge at which His Excellency the Viceroy presided. It was attended by His Excellency the Governor of Punjab and by representatives of Government of India and of Punjab Government. The situation and the possible measures to meet it were discussed.2. Since our previous telegram, hunger strike of Bhagat Singh and Dutt has continued. Dutt is now in weak state and it is not improbable that he will die. Medical officer of the jail has certified that he is medically unfit to attend Saunder,-s&apos; murder trial which is proceeding in Lahore. Bhagat Singh is weak but was able to attend trial until it was adjourned a day or two ago. Some of the other accused in case are on hunger strike in sympathy with Dutt and Bhagat Singh. Reasons for hunger strike of two principals were given in my previous telegram. Punjab Government with the approval of Government of India issued orders giving Superintendent of. the jail discretion to allow special diet on medical grounds to any of the accused in trial including Dutt and Bhagat Singh, which two are convicts as well as &quot; under-trials,&quot; if in the opinion of the Superintendent special diet is desirable, in order to enable accused effectively to watch their interests at the trial which is likely to be prolonged. So far accused have refused to take advantage of this offer and are prosecuting their hunger strike with the view to attempting to force from Government concessions regarding treatment of prisoners who have been convicted of crimes having a political aspect, including prisoners who have been convicted of actual violence, such as convicts in Ivakori case. Punjab Government, with the approval of Government of India, do not propose to give farther concessions than those already granted. The accused in the case have applied to High Court, Lahore, for its transfer and proceedings have been adjourned until 23rd July.Punjab Government consider that death of Dutt or Bhagat Singh would cause considerable local excitement in the cities, but would - probably have little effect amongst the rural classes. One probable result would be the holding of many meetings at which seditious speeches inciting to violence would be made. Another possibility is that it would lead to an attempt of further outrages on Government officials, specially those connected with the Saunders case.3. Apart from the development of the hunger strike, the political situation in the Punjab had not shown, at the time of the conference, any important change since our last telegram. But information received to-day is to the effect that small processions are being held in Lahore with placards stating that Bhagat Singh and Dutt are about to die and extolling them as martyrs. Punjab Government proposes to forbid these by an order under the ordinary law which may be defied, thus leading to trouble.
