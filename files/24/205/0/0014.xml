-    117[This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1929.SECRET.CP. 214 (29). .CABINET.OUR POSITION IN IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.AT the instance of the Lord Privy Seal I have caused to be prepared, and now circulate to my colleagues, the accompanying memorandum, with an appendix, giving an historical survey of British policy in Iraq.The appendix is a reprint of a Cabinet Paper circulated in April 1924, when the former Labour Administration. was in office, and the memorandum to which the appendix is added carries the story down to the present date.The question of our future policy in Iraq is one upon which, on its own account, a decision would in any case have to be taken in due course, but the necessity of taking an early decision is really forced upon us owing to the need of considering the question of the Haifa-Baghdad trans-desert railway and pipe-line, in regard to which I am circulating a separate memorandum CP. 215 (29). The construction of a railway and pipe-line along the route suggested will, if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment assist financially, involve the placing of large orders for railway and bridging material in this country-orders of such magnitude as to have a considerable effect upon our unemployment - problem. It might, however, be argued that it is undesirable to sink further British capital, particularly when it is taxpayers&apos; money, in a railway which, for part of its length, would be within Iraq, if we contemplate &quot;clearing out&quot; of Iraq at an early date and are accordingly left with much less security for any ultimate returns upon the moneys expended.My colleagues will see that the cost of Iraq to this country has fallen by rapid stages from  32,000,000 in 1920-21 to  500,000 per annum at the present time. Paragraph 15 of the memorandum indicates the advantages derived by this country &quot;from this comparatively small expenditure, the most important of which, to my mind, are (a) the maintenance of our prestige in the Middle East and the honourable discharge of our obligations towards the League of Nations, (&amp;) the value of Baghdad as a pivotal point for our air service to India and for any future development of our air service to the Fast East and Australia, and (c) the commercial advantages which /we already enjoy in Iraq from our special relationship to Iraq, apart from those which are to be expected from the undoubtedly rich oil-fields which are on the verge of development. That our existing relationship to Iraq is genuinely useful to that country, I feel convinced.To the question &quot;Can we afford to throw these advantages away?&quot; I feel that we can only return a negative reply. The gradual loosening of our ties with Iraq is already provided for and the process will be such, in the ordinary course of events, that we need not, I feel, hesitate to invest further capital in the country. What has been called a &quot; scuttle policy&quot; is not called for by any considerations existing to-day, and, so far as I can see, would do grave damage to our prestige and our trade, without bringing us any compensating advantage, except the saving of some portion of the  500,000 annually which we now have to find.. Colonial Office, July 18, 1929.[1962-2]   [19759]B
POLICY IN IRAQ.I. Developments since 1924.THE earlier history of this question was set out in a memorandum prepared under the instructions of Mr. Thomas, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, in February 1924, and circulated by him in the following April to the Cabinet of the day.   This memorandum is reprinted as an appendix to the present paper.2. Since the memorandum of February 1924 w&apos;as written, there have been important developments, both political and economic, in Iraq. The principal political developments may be summarised, in the briefest form, as follows : (1.) The &quot;Subsidiary Agreements&quot; mentioned in paragraph 7 of the earlier memorandum were signed in March 1924; they and the Treaty of 1922 were duly accepted by the Iraq Constituent Assembly and were subsequently ratified by the British and Iraq Governments.(2.) The Treaty of 1922, with the modifying Protocol of 1923 and the above-mentioned Subsidiary Agreements (known collectively as the &quot; Treaty of Alliance &quot;), were submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in the autumn of 1924, and were accepted by the Council as giving adequate effect, in respect of Iraq, to the &quot;mandatory&quot; Article (22) of the Covenant of the League of Nations.(3.) The question of the Turco-Iraq frontier was duly settled, in June 1926, by a tripartite agreement between Great Britain, Iraq and Turkey. The frontier has since been delimited on the spot.(4.) A further Treaty, modifying that of 1922, was concluded with the Iraq Government in December 1927; but this Treaty has never been ratified and remains inoperative.3.   The acceptance of the Treaty of Alliance by the Council of the League of Nations was an event of some political significance.   It placed our whole position in Iraq on a regular juridical basis.   At the same time it enabled us to meet the susceptibilities of the Iraqis by avoiding the use of the ward &quot;Mandate,&quot; which had acquired an unpopular meaning in their ears, and by placing our relations with them on the basis of an alliance and not of a &quot; Mandate &quot; in the usual form.   Our actual, position is a somewhat curious one.   We have &quot;accepted a Mandate&quot; in respect of Iraq (from the Principal Allied Powers at San Remo in 1920), yet we do not f&apos; exercise a Mandate &apos;&apos; in the country; nor is there any formal document, as in the case of other mandated territories, which can be referred to as the &quot; Mandate &quot; for Iraq.  The position, whatever its anomalies, has been regularised by the League&apos;s acceptance, and, in practice, has worked reasonably well.   The treaty puts us in a position to carry out all the responsibilities towards the League and towards other nations which we should have incurred under a formal  &quot;Mandate.&quot;   We are careful never to talk about a &apos;1 Mandate &apos;&apos; in Iraq itself; but we present an annual report on Iraq to the League, just as we do in respect of other mandated territories, and we stand an annual cross-examination upon it from the Permanent Mandates Commission at Geneva.   The Iraqis, it should be said, are insistent upon their &quot;independent&quot; status.   In their own eyes they are allies of the British Empire, not wards of Geneva.  Their attitude would entirely rule out (if nothing else did) the facile suggestions of the Harmsworth press that we should &apos;&apos; transfer the mandate to Italy.   The time has gone by when Iraq can be used as a counter in the diplomatic game.   Treaty engagements, to which she is a party, could not be transferred from one Power to another without her consent.4. The boundary settlement with Turkey was not arrived at without grave difficulty. The position in 1924 is described in paragraph 10 of the earlier memorandum. Matters reached a crisis in the autumn of that year and there was at one point a serious danger that actual hostilities might break out. The League of Nations came to the rescue and laid down a provisional frontier (known at the time as the &apos;&apos; Brussels line&quot;) which both sides were to observe pending further investigation.  Following this step, they sent out a Commission to examine the whole
question on the spot. The Commission reported in the summer of 1925 and their report came up for consideration at Geneva in the following December. The mam point at issue was, of course, the fate of the Mosul vilayet. As to this, the Commission took a somewhat guarded view. They held that, provided it could be assumed that the British mandatory regime would be maintained for a further considerable period, then the Mosul vilayet ought to go to Iraq ; if, on the other hand, the mandatory regime was to come to an early termination, then it would be preferable, on the whole, that the vilayet should go to Turkey. By a Resolution, dated the 16th December, 1925, the Council of the League (1) laid down that the frontier -between Turkey and Iraq should follow theso-called &apos;&apos; Brussels line &apos;&apos; (giving the Mosul vilayet to Iraq); and (2) invited the British Government to conclude a new treaty with Iraq ensuring the continuance for 25 years (as against the 4 years laid down in the Protocol of 1923) of the existing mandatory regime as defined in the existing &quot; Treaty of Alliance,&quot; unless Iraq should be admitted as a member of the League before the expiration of that period. The Resolu-tion added that, as soon as such new Treaty had been concluded, the Council would be prepared to declare the frontier &quot; definitive.&quot;The British Government acceded to the Council&apos;s invitation and a new Treaty was duly concluded with Iraq in January 1926, providing for the required extension. The frontier was then declared to be &quot; definitive.&quot; The Turks, after their fashion, accepted the fait accompli. The work of delimitation was carried through speedily and without friction, and there has been little trouble on the frontier since it was completed. Iraq&apos;s relations with Turkey are, in fact, excellent. The &quot; Turkish menace,&quot; once so imminent, has disappeared.5. The Treaty of December 1927, though not yet ratified, and consequently inoperative, calls for some comment. It had its origin in the desire of King Feisal to strengthen his position with his own people by securing for them a notable advance towards complete independence. In substance, the treaty did not modify, to any considerable extent, the relations between Great Britain and Iraq; but it was cast in a form that was regarded as better calculated than that of its predecessor to satisfy Iraqi amour-propre. Under Article 1, for example, Iraq was recognised as &quot;an independent sovereign State.&quot; Article 8,which dealt with the question of the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations, marked a definite step forward. Under the Treaty of 1922 we undertook merely to use our good offices to secure Iraq&apos;s admission to membership &quot; as soon as possible.&quot; The Treaty of 1927 fixes a definite date, viz., 1932, by which we are to support Iraq&apos;s candidature, &quot;provided the present rate of progress in Iraq is maintained and all goes well in the interval.&quot; The new Treaty provided for the revision of certain of the Subsidiary Agreements arising out of the earlier Treaty, and, in particular, those relating to the Military and Financial relations between Great Britain and Iraq. It was made clear to the Iraq Government that the Treaty could not be ratified until the revision of these Agreements had been concluded. In the event, this revision gave rise to difficulties which have so far proved insuperable. These difficulties turn, in the main, on the question of the degree of supervision to be exercised by the British Authorities over the military forces in Iraq. The question need not be discussed here. It will suffice to say that acute differences of opinion arose leading to the resignation of the late Iraqi Ministry. After considerable delay, a new Ministry has been formed and is prepared to carry on without any formal agreement upon the matters in controversy. Meanwhile, though the new Treaty is in abeyance and the old &apos;&apos; Treaty of Alliance &apos;&apos; still in force,* we have intimated to the Iraq Government that we are prepared to stand by our undertaking to support their candidature for admission to the League of Nations in 1932, and to inform the Council accordingly. The admission of Iraq to the League would involve the termination of our &quot; mandatory &quot; responsibilities. It is, in fact, the only regular method, vis-a-vis both the League and Iraq itself, by which such termination can be effected.6. Economic development has centred mainly round the question of oil. In this connection the following extract may be quoted from a White Paper published in* ft should perhaps be mentioned thac certain provisions in the Military and Financial Agreements, though they formed part of the &quot; Treaty of Allianoe,&quot; are no longer in force. They were excluded from the scope of the &quot; extending &quot; Treaty of 1926. The position in regard to these provisions is unsatisfactory ; it has been the subject of negotiation with the Iraq Government, but a solution has still to be found.[19622] b 2
January 1929, under the instructions of the late Secretary of State for the Colonies : &apos;&apos; Two notable events which should contribute to the wealth and prosperity of the country have occurred during the last two years, namely, the grant of oil concessions to the Turkish Petroleum Company and to the Khaniqin Oil Company, a subsidiary of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The former company have established the presence of oil in large quantities, and commercial development merely awaits further testing. The Khaniqin Oil Company have also been successful, and have now brought three wells into production. All the evidence points to a prosperous future for the Iraq oil-fields.&quot;7. It may be explained that the activities of the Khaniqin Oil Company, which is an all-British concern, are confined to the so-called &quot;transferred territories.&quot; i.e., certain areas on the Perso-Iraq border which were transferred from Persia to Turkey under the frontier settlement of 1914. The Turkish Petroleum Company (rechristened quite recently the Iraq Petroleum Company) is an international corporation, the shares in which are held in equal portions by :  (1.) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (British);(2.) The Anglo-Dutch Shell Company (Dutch majority);(3.) A French group; and(4.) An American group.Its concession extends to the whole of the Baghdad and Mosul vilayets, but it is required, under the terms of the concession, to select, within a fixed period, the actual plots which it is to operate. The discovery of oil in large quantities within the area of the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s concession was an event of considerable importance. In a sense, the discovery was rather premature and threw the Company somewhat out of its calculations. The result has been a request for an extension of the period within which plots have to be selected, in order that work may be concentrated upon the rich wells already discovered. This has led to much negotiation with the Iraq Government, which is still pending. The discovery of oil has also brought rival claimants into the field, and has thus complicated the situation still further.8. Something may here be added about the cost of Iraq to the British Exchequer. As stated in paragraph 8 of the earlier memorandum, British expenditure under this head had fallen to  5,500,000 in the year 1924-25.The process of reduction has gone steadily on.In 1925-26 the figure was  4,047,917. In 1926-27 the figure was  3,448,930. In 1927-28 the figure was  2,133,025.In the year 1928 a new system of accounting was introduced, under which the normal cost of the Air Force in Iraq, like that of the Air Force elsewhere, is borne on Air Ministry Estimates and only the &quot;additional&quot; cost, i.e., the extra amount due&quot; to service in Iraq as compared with service elsewhere, is recovered from the Middle Eastern Services Votes. Apart from the normal cost of the R.A.F. garrison, which would presumably have to be paid for wherever the garrison was stationed, Iraq now costs the British taxpayer only  500,000 per annum.II. The Present Situation.9. The foregoing paragraphs indicate some of the more salient factors of the Iraq question; It is not easy to summarise, with any approach to brevity, so complicated a situation. The picture has its good and bad features. Externally, the situation is good. The northern frontier has been settled and the Turkish danger eliminated. There has been a certain amount of bickering between Iraq and her eastern neighbour, Persia; but relations have now improved and will, it is hoped, improve still further. On the south and south-west Iraq marches with Nejd, which forms part of the kingdom of the formidable Ibn Sa&apos;ud. Here there has been a good deal of local trouble. The frontier is a mere imaginary line across the desert, over which the nomad tribes (owing little allegiance to any authority on either side) have raided and counter-raided from time immemorial.  Matters became acute about
a year and a half ago, owing to repeated raids by Nejd tribesmen; but effective steps have since been taken to strengthen the border defences, and we may hope for quieter times in future.10. Internally, the constitutional regime of King Feisal is fairly under way. A Parliament is functioning, according to its lights, and the administrative machine is working with reasonable smoothness. It would be idle to pretend that there are no difficulties, or that the relations of the Iraq Government, either with its own subjects or with its British allies, leave nothing to be desired. The following extract from a memorandum circulated by Mr. Amery in February last may be quoted in this connection : &quot; Our policy of ruling without governing in Iraq, of exercising control through an ostensibly independent native Government, is in the nature of an experiment. Iraq is still scarcely more than a geographical expression. The different races which inhabit the country have not yet been welded into a single Iraqi nation. A Kurd is still primarily a Kurd and only secondarily (if at all to his own mind) an Iraqi. The tribal confederations of the Euphrates admit no natural loyalty or allegiance to the Iraq Government. The Kurd still dislikes and despises the Arab, the Christian hates and fears the Moslems, and the Sbiah distrusts the Sunni; and until these traditional antagonisms have been subordinated to a spirit of patriotism, the British Representative in Iraq must, as Sir H. Dobbs explains in this despatch, hold the scales even, and to do so must intervene in matters which might otherwise properly be left to the discretion of the native government. In a country such as Iraq, where national consciousness has outstripped administrative experience, such intervention is apt to be resented and to cause political friction.&quot;11. Despite the difficulties that arise from time to time, it may fairly be claimed that the experiment has, on the whole, been a success. Certainly, it has been more successful than most of us thought at all likely when the regime was first inaugurated in 1921. The Iraqi &quot; Nationalists &quot; may clamour for greater independence, and for release from British control, but the soberer elements in the population do not really wish us to go, and realise that, if our assistance and support were withdrawn, their house of cards would be in serious danger of collapse. We are pledged, in any case, to support Iraqi&apos;s candidature for admission to the League of Nations three years hence. The time is short enough. It may be doubted whether any serious Iraqi politician, whatever he may say in public (and King Feisal did on one occasion ask that the date might be advanced), really wishes to make it shorter.III. Future Policy.12. Advocates of an early termination of our special relations with Iraq rely on four main arguments or classes of argument: (1.) That the present policy imposes an undue burden upon the British Exchequer;(2.) That   it   involves  the   British   Government   in  undesirable  military commitments;(3.) That the Iraqis have no desire for our assistance and would be glad to see our backs; and(4.) That no substantial British interest is served by our remaining in the country.13. The financial argument has in the past been used with formidable effect both in the Press and on the platform. In the days when, as in 1920-21, we were spending over  20,000,000 on garrisoning Iraq, the force of this argument was undeniable. When our expenditure was still in the neighbourhood of  4,000,000 or  5,000,000, it still had great weight; but to-day, when the cost of our policy has been reduced to the comparatively small figure of  500,000 per annum, talk about heavy financial burdens is clearly out of date. This has, indeed, been generally recognised. The newspaper clamour, once so active, died away some time ago. Lord Rothermere made some faint attempts to revive it on the eve of the late General Election, but he appears to have had no success in arousing public excitement on the subject.
14. Our military commitments have been greatly exaggerated. Since the Air Ministry assumed military control in 1922, it has been found possible to withdraw the entire garrison of regular troops, both British and Indian, and not a single regular battalion now remains in the country. In spite of this, order has been maintained without difficulty, and such military operations as have had to be undertaken from time to time have been carried out with success. The fact is, that, with a settlement with Turkey, the problem of Traq&apos;s external defence has largely been solved. The improved relations with Persia mark another step forward, while the position has been further safeguarded by the steps taken last year to strengthen the defensive arrangements on the Nejd frontier. The problem of defence has been reduced to manageable proportions, and the RAP. have fully demonstrated that they can handle it with success.15. The argument that the Iraqis would welcome our departure has been dealt with in general terms in paragraph 11 above. There is reason to believe that such a desire, in so far as it exists,&apos; is confined to a comparatively small and irresponsible section, and does not extend to the great mass of the people or to the more level-headed of the local politicians.16. There remains the question of British interests. This aspect of the problem was discussed, from the point of view both of material advantage and of national credit, in paragraphs 12-14 of the memorandum of 1924. It may be useful to restate the case, in the light of subsequent developments, with somewhat greater precision. The main points in the argument are as follows : (1.) If we left Iraq suddenly there is reason to fear that the country would relapse into a state of anarchy. An Iraq &apos;&apos; army &apos;&apos; is in process of formation; but it has scarcely reached a stage at which.it could cope effectually (without the aid of the R.A.F.) with tribal disaffection, frontier raids, or internal risings. Iraqi nationality is a plant of recent and tender growth. King feisal&apos;s hold upon the country and upon the loyalty of his subjects is not a factor upon which complete reliance can yet be placed. If the country were reduced to anarchy, presumably the Turks would in due course come back, and (apart from the discredit attaching to an open failure of policy), we should be faced again with the very position which confronted us at the outbreak of the Great War (see paragraph 2 of the earlier memorandum). We should also have lost the advantage, for what it may be worth, of a stable and friendly Arab state in a &quot; Key &quot; position in the Mohammedan world (see paragraph 13 of the earlier memorandum).(2.) We have publicly accepted in trust from the League of Nations the task of setting up a stable government in Iraq and assisting the country until it can safely stand alone. Until we are satisfied that this responsibility has been fully and honourably discharged, we cannot with decency or credit take our hand from the plough.(3.) Any attempt to cut short the term of our responsibility would probably meet with strenuous opposition from the Council of the League of Nations. It was in reliance upon our continued discharge of our duty that the Council (see paragraph 4 above) decided the all-important question of the Mosul frontier in the sense that we desired. If we attempted so soon after the Council&apos;s decision to renounce our task, it might appear to the League that we had obtained the frontier award on something very like false pretences. We have good reason to apprehend what the general attitude at Geneva will be. When the unratified Treaty of 1927 (which provided for a relaxation of British Control that was little more than nominal) was discussed by the Permanent Mandates Commission last year, it met with a good deal of unfavourable criticism, in which the French member of the Commission took an active part. It may be anticipated that the French Government, always nervous of possible reactions in Syria, would be much opposed to any suggestion of an immediate termination of British responsibilities in Iraq. It must be borne in mind that any modification of our &quot;mandatory&apos;&apos; relations with Iraq requires the approval of the Council, and that the Council can take no decision in such a matter otherwise than unanimously.   These considerations point....... ...... .:y .....     .. ------------     ------
to the conclusion that lraq&apos;s admission could be effected only as the result of considerable negotiation, in the course of which a good deal of opposition would have to be met and overcome. Whether it would be physically possible to bring it about before 1932, may fairly be doubted. (4.) The discovery of oil in large quantities in the Mosul vilayet has transformed the economic aspect of the question. We have now to consider our position inrelation to what may well become one of the principal oil-fields of the world. So long as we remain in Iraq, we can, in the last resort at least, control this important source of supply. Such control would be invaluable in the event of war, and even in peace time is an asset of the greatest magnitude. The general oil politics of the Empire are outside the scope of this memorandum and can be discussed authoritatively only be those departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government that are directly concerned. It will suffice here to call attention to the question as one to which great importance attaches both on strategic and on commercial grounds.(5.) There is also the question of air policy. Baghdad is a vital link in the chain both of civil aviation to the East and of aerial control as exercised by the R.A.F. over a wide area. The retention of the Baghdad Aerodrome, and of Air facilities in Iraq generally, is a matter which the Air Ministry are understood to regard as of primary importance. This again is a subject upon which the Colonial Office is not competent to speak with authority. It is for the Air Council themselves to state their case in all its bearings; but the point must be mentioned here as perhaps the most important of all those that arise in connection with the problem under consideration.(6.) There is also the general question of British trade with Iraq. The value of this trade, though less than in the days when there was a large British garrison in the country, is still substantial. According to the latest figures available (those for 1927) Great Britain and India between them accounted for 55 per cent, of the import trade and for 47 per cent, of the exports. Imports from Great Britain reached the considerable figure of  2,700,000 (mainly cotton piece-goods, metals and machinery). Indian imports were returned at  1,500,000. To what extent this trade depends upon the maintenance of existing political relations, is difficult to estimate. No kind of preferential treatment is, or could be, accorded to British merchants or goods; that is wholly precluded by our mandatory engagements. Yet our presence in the country, and our peculiar position in relation to it, are probably not without their effect upon trade. Iraq tends, in practice, to buy from us rather than from our rivals. She will buy even more, it may be hoped, as her own economic resources develop and her purchasing power increases. In this direction oil is not the only possibility. Cotton-growing has made a hopeful start, and there is a prospect, as irrigation improves, of great expansion in the production of cereals. If, as a result of premature political action, these developments suffered a serious set-back, as they well might do, it would be reasonable to expect that the effect upon British trade would be appreciable.17. There is one form of rejoinder to which the foregoing arguments are open. The critic may retort : &quot; These British interests, however vital they may be, have got to be surrendered sooner or later. No one pretends that we are to stay in Iraq for ever. On the contrary, we are pledged, on your own showing, to shepherd the country into the League in 1932. That will mean the extinction of our present special relations, and consequently of our power to preserve our special interests. What is the particular virtue in three years? Why not give up now what we shall have, in any case, to give up three years hence ? &quot; A partial answer to this question may be found in paragraph 13 of the memorandum of 1924. It has always been con-templated that, before our &apos;&apos; mandatory &apos;&apos; relations with Iraq come to an end, we shall conclude a new Agreement with the Iraq Government safeguarding such of our interests in the country as are regarded as vital and permanent. The Baghdad Aerodrome is one of these interests, and there is no reason to believe that the Iraq Government will make difficulties about its retention even after Iraq, by admission to the League, has passed out of the tutelary stage and has acquired the full status of an independent country.   The same applies, in varying degree, to other British
interests, commercial or political. But things move slowly in the East. The negotia-tion of any Agreement with the Iraq Government is, as we know to our cost, a long and laborious business. An attempt to &quot; rush&quot; an Oriental negotiator is always doomed to failure. Therein lies the virtue of three years. It will give us a breathing space in which to set our affairs in order, to bring Iraq further along the path of self-reliance, and to make due provision for the future. It will also give us time to argue our case at Geneva, to remove misunderstandings and to satisfy the doubtful. For these purposes three years are none too long, and it is to be feared that an attempt to shorten the period might merely lead to confusion and discredit, if not to actual disaster.Colonial Office, July 8, 1929.
APPENDIX.Memorandum Circulated to the Cabinet in April 1924. British Policy in Iraq.The country now known officially as Iraq covers the area which comprised before the war the three Turkish &quot;vilayets,&quot; or provinces, of Mosul, Baghdad and Basrah. It extends from the hill country north of Mosul (the ancient Nineveh) southwards to the head of the Persian Gulf, a distance of some 550 miles. It contains the whole basin of the lower Euphrates and Tigris, which unite at Khurna, about 100 miles from the sea. Hence its classical name of Mesopotamia (the land between the rivers). The population of the Baghdad and Basrah vilayets is almost entirely Arab; that of the Mosul Vilayet is also largely Arab, but there is a considerable mixture of other elements. The hill country to the north and east of the vilayet is predominantly Kurdish. It forms a screen, separating the rest of the vilayet from Turkey to the north and Persia to the east. Politically, the whole country was Turkish before the war. The total population is estimated at about 2f millions. The vast majority are Mohammedans, divided in fairly equal proportions between the two sects of Sunnis and Shiahs.2. The entry of Turkey into the war made it necessary to send an expeditionary force to Basrah. We could not abandon without a struggle our 100 years&apos; predominance in the Persian Gulf; nor could we, for strategic reasons, allow the head of the Gulf to remain in hostile occupation. Had we done so, the Gulf might have been converted into an enemy lake, with hostile submarine bases, &amp;c. The effect upon our communications with India would have been disastrous. A further consideration was the need to protect the Persian oil-fields (nothing to do with Mosul oil), which are connected by a pipe-line with the head of the Gulf. These oil-fields were of great value to the Navy during the war, as affording our ships regular access to an ample supply of oil in Eastern waters.3. Whether the above considerations necessitated an advance beyond the Basrah. Vilayet may be open to dispute. In war it is never easy, and may be perilous, to sit still. At any rate, we did not sit still. The end of the war found us in occupation of practically the whole of the area covered by the three Turkish Vilayets of Basrah, Baghdad and Mosul. In the course of the campaign we had given various pledges, undertakings, &amp;c, to the local Arabs. We told the Persian Gulf Sheikhs early in the proceedings that Basrah would never be allowed to revert to Turkish authority. Later, we told the people of Basrah that they might look forward to &quot; a more benign administration &quot; in future. On occupying Baghdad (March 1917) we proclaimed that we had come hot as conquerers, but as &quot; liberators,&quot; and invited the inhabitants to co-operate with us in our task, so that they might be united with their kinsmen abroad in &quot; realising, the aspirations of their race.&quot; Meanwhile, in October 1915, &apos;Sir H. McMahon had made his famous promise to the Sherif of Mecca (now King-Hussein of the Hejaz) that we would recognise and support&quot; the independence of the Arabs within defined geographical limits. These limits included the whole of Iraq, though we made special reservations in respect of established British interests in the latter.4. For about two years after the armistice we governed Iraq on what has been called the Indian model. That is to say, we set up what was in effect direct British administration. The experiment, supported as it was by overwhelming military strength, seemed for a time to be working well. It broke down in the summer of 1920, when a local rising on the Euphrates developed into a serious rebellion, which was put down with much difficulty with the aid of reinforcements sent from India. As to the cause of this outbreak, opinion is not unanimous. It may or may not have been due, as was freely alleged at the time, to discontent with direct British rule and delay in the fulfilment of war-time promises of independence. At any rate, it had the effect of directing public interest upon the Iraq question and of causing the British Cabinet to modify their policy.5. Sir Percy Cox,&apos; who had served in the Expeditionary Force as Chief Political Officer, was appointed High Commissioner in the autumn of 1920. In March 1921 the control of all Middle Eastern areas was concentrated in a single [19622] c
Department, viz., the Colonial Office. The newly appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Churchill) proceeded to Cairo in March 1921, where he had summoned a conference of all the principal officers engaged in administering the Middle East. The upshot, so far as Iraq was concerned, was that the Emir Eeisal, a son of the King of the Hejaz, was invited to proceed to Baghdad as a candidate for the throne of Iraq. His candidature was successful, and he was crowned at Baghdad on the 23rd August, 1921. A native ministry had been appointed by the High Commissioner before the King&apos;s arrival, and the new regime was introduced without difficulty. Direct British administration was replaced by a system under which the functions of British officers ceased to be executive and became advisory.6. Our legal position in Iraq rested in the first instance on the right of conquest. Since April 1920 it has been based on the action of the Principal Allied Powers, who, at the San Remo Conference, invited His Britannic Majesty to assume the position of Mandatory for Iraq under the League of Nations. Iraq, it may be observed, falls under the definition given in article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, of &quot; certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire,&quot; whose independence is to be provisionally recognised, subject to the administrative advice and assistance of a Mandatory, until they can stand alone. The terms of the Mandate under which this advice and assistance are to be rendered are subject to the approval of the League. A draft Mandate for Iraq was submitted to the League in December 1920. Owing to various difficulties, mainly arising out of the attitude of the United States, the draft has never been formally approved, though in October 1921 we obtained a kind of ad interim authority from the League in the shape of a letter from the President of its Council, inviting us to continue to carry on the administration of Iraq in the spirit of the draft mandate until such time as the position should have been regularised. In the meantime Iraq, under our guidance, has advanced rapidly along the path indicated in the Covenant. Provisional recognition of independence has been transformed into something like absolute recognition. In October 1922, having previously notified the League of our intentions, we embodied our relations with the Iraq Government in the form of a Treaty of Alliance, concluded as between equals. It is now proposed, when the moment arrives, to invite the League to accept the treaty in substitution for the draft mandate.7. The Treaty of October 1922 was signed shortly before the fall of the Coalition Government. It provided for the continuance of British advice and assistance (on conditions to be laid down in detail in subsidiary agreements) for a period of twenty years. After the change of Government in England it was decided to reduce the period to four years. Effect was given to this decision by a protocol signed at Baghdad in April 1923. Since the signature of the protocol the subsidiary agreements have been under active negotiation. They are now practically complete. Meanwhile, under a somewhat complicated electoral system a Constituent Assembly has been getting itself elected in Iraq. It is expected to assemble at Baghdad early in March. Its first business will be to accept the Treaty and subsidiary Agreements, and to pass the Organic Law of Iraq, the terms of which have already been settled between ourselves and the Iraq Government.8. Another important change introduced by Mr. Churchill was the transfer (October 1922) of military control in Iraq from the War Office to the Air Ministry. Under the system of air control the strength of the British garrison in Iraq, and consequently the cost of the country to the British taxpayer, has been very rapidly reduced. The garrison is now down to four infantry battalions (three Indian and one British), in addition to R.A.F. personnel, while expenditure from the British exchequer, which totalled 32 millions in 1920-21, fell to 23 millions in 1921-22, to 9 millions in 1922-23, to 7 millions in 1923-24, and to 5% millions (estimate) for 1924-25. Further progressive reductions are contemplated during the four years of the Treaty period (which dates from the ratification of the Peace Treaty with Turkey, and therefore has not yet actually started), by the end of which time the troops will have disappeared and British expenditure on the defence of Iraq will have come to an end.9. It is right to add, as a further testimony to the efficiency of air control, that these great reductions have been effected without any serious disturbance of the local situation; and this, despite the fact that peace with Turkey, on the early conclusion of which all the calulations of 1921 were based, did not become an accomplished fact until the 24th July, 1923, and even now has left the question of the Turco-Iraq frontier unsettled.   One drawback to the system has been illustrated
during the last few weeks. Iraq.is a country of which the settled areas are fringed by an outlying belt inhabited by unruly tribes and Beduin. To keep the latter in order something beyond ordinary police action is required from time to time. When further steps are necessary it is&quot; the R.A.F. that has to take them. In most cases a demonstration is sufficient. But if it proves insufficient, and if more active measures have to be applied, the R.A.F. cannot proceed, whatever precautions are taken (and it is quite clear that all possible precautions are taken), except by methods that are necessarily somewhat indiscriminate. It is not that air action causes more casualties than action by ground forces; probably the reverse is the case. But it offers a wider surface to ill-informed criticism, and is more apt to create incidents which lend themselves to press agitation and Parliamentary attack. This is a drawback inherent in a system of air control. As against it must be placed the strikingly successful results that have been achieved.10. The most important question still outstanding in regard to Iraq is the settlement of the Northern frontier, i.e., the Turco-Iraq boundary. Under the Treaty of Lausanne the question was left over for &quot; friendly arrangement &quot; between Turkey and Great Britain within nine months, with a subsequent reference (if no agreement had been reached) to the Council of the League of Nations. We regard the nine months as having begun with a communication addressed to. the Turkish Government in October 1923, but active negotiations have not yet started. Their outcome is very dubious. The Turks at the first Lausanne Conference claimed the whole of the Mosul Vilayet, and were not to be moved from their position by all the powerful and closely reasoned arguments brought to bear upon them by Lord Curzon. Our own attitude has always been that, while ready to consider minor rectifications at this point or that, we must maintain in substance the present administrative boundary, which coincides pretty closely with the pre-war boundary of the Mosul Vilayet. How far the Turks, when we get to grips with them, will adhere to their extreme claims remains .to be seen.11. The frontier question is bound up with that of the Assyrians, a scattered remnant of an ancient Christian community who took the Allied side during the war and, as a consequence, were driven out of their ancestral homes. We have a plan for settling these people in the northern frontier districts of Iraq, under a loose form of relationship to the Iraq State; but the success of this plan depends on our obtaining a frontier which will exclude from Turkey the area in which it is proposed to settle the Assyrians. The retrocession of the whole of the Mosul Vilayet, or even of a substantial part of it, would seriously affect the prestige and stability of the Iraq State. It might even make FeisaFs position impossible and bring the whole of our Iraq policy to the ground. The question of the Mosul oil-fields is also involved to the extent that, if the Mosul Vilayet is returned to the Turks, the oil-fields (the value of which is quite conjectural) would, of course, pass wholly out of our control. The point is one that must be mentioned in this connection. It is not suggested that it can, or ought to be, regarded as a determining consideration. There are also strategical questions involved. To restore the Mosul Vilayet to the Turks would bring them within striking distance of Baghdad, and, apart from the blow to King FeisaFs prestige, would, in the opinion of high military authority, make his position untenable on military grounds.12. It may well be asked, what good does the British nation or the British Empire get out of all this ? If we are to leave Iraq in any case four years hence, wTry not leave at once and have done with it? The short answer is that if we leave now- the Iraq State will inevitably collapse, the country will be reduced to anarchy, and in due course the Turk will return. Even the four years of the Protocol of 1923 is an exceedingly short period in which to nurse Iraq through its nonage and set it upon its own feet as a self-reliant State. At best it is something of a gamble; but there are at least good chances of a successful issue. We have during the last three years reduced the whole question to manageable proportions. The intolerable financial burden of three years ago has now been converted into a comparatively small (the word comparatively is emphasised) and diminishing annual charge which will disappear altogether in four years&apos; time. Our national credit is deeply involved in the successful issue of our policy. We could not abandon the task now, and leave our friends and supporters to their fate, without exposing ourselves to the charge of a glaring breach of faith. The spectacle of the great British Empire repudiating its obligations, when almost within sight of their final liquidation, would create a lamentable impression all over the world. It could not fail to react to our disadvantage in India and Egypt. We cannot, it is submitted, afford to scuttle the ship within a few miles of port.T19622] d
13. There is also a more positive side to the question. The Protocol of April 1923, which limited the Treaty period to four years, also provided for the conclusion before the end of that period of a fresh agreement &quot; to regulate the subsequent relations between the High Contracting Parties.&quot; In this connection the following extract may be quoted from the Report (dated the 23rd March, 1923) of the Cabinet Committee appointed by the late Government : &quot; We anticipate that, although the mandatory relations of Great Britain with Iraq and the financial liabilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government will have terminated within the stated period, it will be the desire both of King Feisal and the people of Iraq that the special relations existing between Great Britain and the Arab Kingdom shall not be abruptly terminated, but that an agreement will be capable of conclusion between the two Governments .... which may admit of British assistance being given to the Arab State, at no cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a view to the development of its resources and the stability of its administration. In such an arrangement special provision for the maintenance of British interests, including those relating to the port of Basrah and facilities for Imperial air routes, may profitably be included.&quot;Iraq, from its geographical situation between Turkey, Arabia and Persia, may be regarded as a key position in the Mohammedan world. The existence of a stable Arab State, bound by special ties of friendship and gratitude to Great Britain, and breaking the chain of possibly hostile influences, may be of immense importance to us in- the difficult times that lie before us. A minor, but still important point, is that Baghdad is regarded as a vital stage in the air route to India and the East.14. On the economic side, the case is perhaps less easy to establish. The popular view that Iraq is a mere arid desert is far removed from the truth. In ancient times the country was one of the granaries of the world. The old irrigation system (though traces of it are still to be seen) has long since disappeared. Until it is replaced, the country will not regain its prosperity. Irrigation is its vital need; but irrigation costs money, which in these days is very difficult to find. But that the country will repay development cannot be doubted. Development means foreign enterprise, and it is clearly to the advantage of this country that such enterprise should be retained in British hands.15. It is quite clear that the Iraq Government itself looks forward to retaining British advice and assistance even after the Treaty period comes to an end. It is already in negotiation to obtain the services of British administrative advisers on long-term contracts, running, in some cases, to a period of fifteen years. The terms and conditions under which these officers are to be engaged will be regulated by one of the Agreements subsidiary to the Iraq Treaty, of which mention has already been made. Their employment is an essential feature of our whole policy and a guarantee of the continued maintenance of British influence in Iraq after the termination of the Treaty. If officers of the right stamp are to be obtained, they must have reasonable security of tenure. The plan proposed, and approved in principle by the late Government, was that the due fulfilment by the Iraq Government of the terms of contract should be guaranteed by the Secretary of State. But such a guarantee cannot be given without specific authority from Parliament. That is the meaning of the draft Bill, regarding which a separate submission was recently made. The terms of the Bill have been carefully worked out in consultation with the Treasury, whose suggestions have been embodied in the latest version of the draft. The proposed guarantee involves a maximum contingent liability estimated at 570,000Z., of which it is not anticipated that any part will actually become payable. In any event, the amount of the contingent liability will decrease progressively each year that the Iraq Government remains in existence and continues to fulfil its obligations. In ten years it is calculated that the total liability will have been reduced to 100,OOOZ., and in fifteen years it will have disappeared altogether. Unless there is to be complete reversal of policy in Iraq, it is essential that the necessary powers to cover the proposed guarantee should be obtained from Parliament with the least possible cleiay. An early decision, authorising action on the lines proposed, is urgently required.16. The general situation in Iraq at the present time is described in some detail in the recent despatch from the High Commissioner, which is now under circulation to the Cabinet. His account is on the whole a very favourable one. In a recent telegram (the 2nd February, 1924) Sir H. Dobbs reported as follows :   &quot; The country is now exceedingly peaceful, and I myself and the British advisers and inspectors are working in complete harmony with the Iraq Government and
people.&quot; Considering the difficulties that have had to be overcome, the present situation may fairly be regarded with satisfaction. But we must guard against taking too sanguine a view. There are many difficulties still to be faced. &quot;We do not know what will be the attitude of the Constituent Assembly when elected. We cannot count with entire confidence on FeisaFs power (or perhaps even his will) to resist the demands of the more extreme Arab &quot;nationalists.&quot; There may be more trouble with Beduin in the Euphrates area or with Kurds in the northern highlands, x We have still to settle with the Turk. There is no use in idealising the Arabs, whether King or peasant, or in attributing to them qualities which they do not possess. The best of them are shifty and unreliable from the western standpoint. We have to work with the material that lies to hand, and shall gain nothing by pretending that it is better than it is. But while making all allowances, it may fairly be claimed that we are engaged upon a worthy task, and are in a fair way to carry it through with success.Middle East Department,Colonial Office, February 8, 1924.
