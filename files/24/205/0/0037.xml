[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1929.SECRET. Copy No.     43CP. 238 (29).(PART I.)CABINET.THE HAGUE CONFERENCE, 1929.Synopsis.Note by the Secretary to the Cabinet.THE attached Memorandum has been prepared under instructions from the British Delegates, but (owing to pressure of other work) somewhat hastily, in order to provide a conspectus of the events at The Hague Conference from the first arrival until the evening of Friday, the 23rd August. Since the object is to bring out the events leading up to the present situation, which results from difficulties on the financial side of the Conference work, no attempt has been made at this stage to give more than the briefest summary of the situation in the Political Commission, of which Mr. Henderson is Chairman and which has made comparatively good progress and is held up mainly owing to failure to make progress on the financial side.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY, Secretary,Cabinet and British Delegation.The Grand Hotel, Scheveningen, Holland, August 23, 1929.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the British Delegation.Introductory.We left London on the morning of Sunday, the 4th August, travelling via Harwich and Flushing, and arrived the same evening at The Hague, where we were received on behalf of the Dutch Government by the Foreign Minister, M. Beelaerts van Blokland.2. In order to appreciate the conditions under which we were working, perhaps it is worth explaining that, owing to the short notice at which The Hague was chosen as the meeting-place of the Conference and the crowded state of the hotels during the tourist season, our Delegation was somewhat scattered. The Delegates, with Sir Maurice Hankey and the Treasury Section, stayed at the Grand Hotel, Scheveningen, a seaside suburb situated two or three miles from The Hague. The representatives of the Foreign Office, including Sir Cecil Hurst and Sir Eric Phipps, were at the Hotel Bellevue, at The Hague, and the remainder of the Delegation at the Central Hotel, -in the same city. As no office accommodation could be secured in any of the hotels we obtained the use of an empty bank building as offices, at a nominal rent. These offices are close to the Binnenhof, where the meetings of the Conference and its Commissions and Sub-Committees were held, and the Offices of the Secretariat-General situated.[19849] b
3. At this point we would observe that the Dutch Government had made admirable arrangements for the accommodation of the Conference, for which our gratitude was offered at the First Plenary Session of the Conference.The bulk of the British Delegation (apart from Sir Maurice Ffankey and a small party which had arrived earlier to make advance arrangements) arrived early on Monday, the 5th August. Our first official action was to assemble the whole of the heads of sections and to impress upon them the importance of preserving a united front. The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a general outline of the policy he proposed to pursue, and asked that steps should be taken to ensure that this was supported by every member of the Delegation, high or low, in any communications he might have with the foreign Delegations. Steps were also taken at this early stage, which have since been actively followed up, to keep the Press informed of our sreneral attitude, with results which the Cabinet cannot have failed to observe.4. During Monday, the 5th August, the various Delegations were assembling. As at many of the hotels telephones had not yet been installed in the rooms of the Delegates, the greatest difficulty was encountered in effecting communication. The French Delegation arrived very late in the day and it was not until 7-30 p.m. that, on our initiative, it was found possible to arrange an informal meeting of repre-sentatives of the Delegations of each of the six Inviting Powers to consider the procedure on the opening day.The Formal Opening.5. The Conference opened on Tuesday the 6th August in the First (Upper) Chamber of the States-General. This was a formal public meeting, at which the Foreign Secretary of the Dutch Government welcomed the Delegates and suitable replies were made.Organisation of the Conference.6. The first business meeting was held in the afternoon of the same day, when it was arranged that the Chair should be taken in rotation by the principal Delegates of the Inviting Powers, M. Jaspar, the Prime Minister of Belgium, acting as President on the first occasion. As a matter of convenience it was arranged that M. Jaspar should remain in the Chair for the three business Plenary Meetings held up to date, as the general discussion opened at the afternoon meeting on the 6th August occupied the whole of these meetings.7. To complete the story of the organisation of the Conference, and before coming to the vitally important matters which were raised at the very first business session, it is sufficient to mention that two main Commissions were set up, known respectively as the Political and Financial Commissions. Mr. Arthur Henderson was elected Chairman of the former, and Baron Ffoutart, the Belgian Finance Minister, of the latter. Sir Maurice Hankey was appointed Secretary-General and organised an International Secretariat, although in the circumstances a large part of the work fell inevitably upon the British Delegation Staff, which, though originally equipped for Delegation purposes only, was the only one with any semblance of adequate organisation.The Political Commission.8. As regards the Political Commission we do not propose at this stage to enter into details, since it is with the financial affairs of the Conference that this Memorandum deals in the main. A very good start has been made, and there is every reason to suppose that agreement can be reached without very much difficulty in regard to the early evacuation of both the second and third zones of the Rhineland, and that a solution is being worked out by the Jurists Committee for the difficult problem of some form of Commission of Verification and Conciliation which will satisfy the French without outraging German susceptibilities. The question of the cost of the Armies of Occupation during the evacuation, and of payment for damages, was expected to prove more difficult of solution, but even on this point Dr. Stresernann appears prepared to contemplate the acceptance of liability by Germany in return for the concession of  early evacuation.     M.  Briand, however,  has made it
unmistakably clear that all progress in the work of the Political Commission is subject to a settlement of the financial question. Though Dr. Stresemann disputes any essential connection between the two subjects, M. Briand is in a position, and has&apos;not hesitated, to hold up the work of the Political Commission until he is satisfied on the financial side.9. The German Delegation made one effort to bring the question of the evacuation of the Saar on to the floor of the Political Commission, but M. Briand vigorously resisted this. On the initiative taken by Mr. Henderson in a private and informal meeting of the Delegates of the Inviting Powers, it has been agreed that the question shall not be brought up unless both Dr. Stresemann and M. Briand desire it.The Financial Commission.10. This Memorandum, however, is concerned in the main with the affairs of the Financial Commission, which is dealing with the Young Report.11. Our instructions on this subject are contained in the following extract from the Cabinet Minute of the 17th July :  &quot;In the last-named Memorandum (Paper CP. 203 (29)) the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked his colleagues to agree to his pursuing the financial negotiations involved by the Report in accordance with the following principles :-(a.) We should insist rigidly on such adjustments of the distribution of the total German Annuities as to give us the full percentage due to us under the existing agreements.(6.) We should urge strongly our views on Deliveries in Kind so as to secure their reduction within the narrowest possible limits (so far as Italy is concerned, if we succeed in restoring our Spa percentage it will automatically reduce the amounts which Italy can take in Deliveries in Kind); and in so far as Deliveries in Kind are continued, we should insist that the British Recovery Act should be treated exactly in the same wTay as Deliveries in Kind.(c.) We should press the French in regard to the exorbitant share of the unconditional annuities which they have claimed for themselves, and we should insist, firstly, that they should not convert this priority (as there appears to be some chance they may) into a definite increase of their share in the total German payments; and, secondly, that we should get our full share of any market issue in America, as well as complete control over any issues in London; but provided that we were safeguarded on these points we should not press our objections to the French priority as a sine qua non.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed (i.) That, at the Plenary Meeting at the outset of the Reparations Con-ference the British Representatives should make a statement based on principles (a), (b) and (c) proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and quoted above. At the second stage of the Conference, after Committees had been set up, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should develop and press our claims under these three heads and should do his utmost to secure the adoption of our views. If he should find it impossible to secure their adoption, he should refer to his Cabinet colleagues for instructions.* * * * * *&quot;(Cabinet 29 (29), Conclusion 6.)1.2. From the narrative which follows it will be seen that we have rigorously adhered to the instructions of the Cabinet from the date of the first Plenary Meeting until to-day.13. Before describing events here, however, we desire to point out that the general attitude of the, British Government on this subject was pretty clearly revealed by the Debate in the House of Commons on Friday, the 26th July, 1929. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ speech be read in conjunction with that of[19849] &apos; b 2
Mr. Lloyd George, there could be no doubt as to what our attitude&apos; would be. The three points mentioned in the Cabinet Minute, namely, the distribution of the German Annuities, Deliveries in Kind, and the exorbitant French share in the unconditional annuities, all came in for severe criticism. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, though he had to choose his words carefully, did not conceal his agree-ment with Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s criticism, as may be shown by the following extract:  . , *&quot;There are, it seems to me, three main points in this Report which have very serious interest to us. The Right Hon. Gentleman dealt with all of them. I will put it like this. The British Government will raise no protest against, but will accept the scale of German annuities. On that we are all agreed. Now as to the question of distribution. It is very difficult indeed to choose one&apos;s words, but I might perhaps get out of my difficulty by saying that I am in agreement with what the Right Hon. Gentleman has said. In regard to Deliveries in Kind, we could not agree, unless, of course, we were finally compelled to do so, to accept the proposals with regard to Deliveries in Kind which are embodied in the Report. We will, of course, have something to say in the Conference upon the distinction which has been made between the postponable and the unconditional annuities. That is a matter of the greatest importance.Mr. Lloyd George : And the fact that we have no share at all in the unconditional annuities.Mr. Snowden :  That is a matter on which we shall certainly take intoaccount the position described by the Right Hon. Gentleman.....I amexpressing my own view, and I think the view of the Government, when I say that the limit of concessions by this country has been reached.&quot;In view of the above Debate, the Delegations at The Hague Conference had no right to express the surprise they affected at the attitude taken up from the first by the British Delegation.14. We were in fact not dilatory in making clear our position. At the very first business Meeting, that is to say, the Second Plenary Meeting, the Chancellor of the Exchequer revealed our attitude in no uncertain terms. His position may best be shown from a few extracts from the proces-verbai: &quot;It is quite true that the Report says that it is an indivisible whole, but I am afraid that if the Conference accepts that statement and takes the proposals in the Report as they now stand, we should have an agreement which would be in some respects a rather inconsistent document.fl&quot; *JP -7V&quot; -A&quot;I will speak now of the position of the British members of the Experts&apos; Committee. They were not Government representatives. They did not take their instructions from the British Government, and, as my predecessor in office, Mr. Churchill, stated at the time of their appointment, and as he afterwards repeated in the House of Commons, the British Government were in no way committed to accept or adopt whatever recommendations this Committee might make.M. M, Jt. : J . , -Y-lunderderff &quot;TF *3r w tv* *jvIn the first place, we come to a matter, the fundamental part of the Plan, upon which I think there will be no difficulty in getting the unanimous acceptance of the Conference. I refer to the amount and scale of the Reparation annuities which Germany under this Plan will be called upon to pay.&quot;After showing the advantages which the Young Plan offers over the Dawes Plan, as, for example, in fixing the duration of the annuities, the total amount that Germany will have to pay, the abolition of controls, the restoration of the economic sovereignty of Germany, and after criticising some other minor points, such as the railway contribution, the Dawes payments before the 31st August, 1929, the vagueness of the Young Report in regard .to the cost of the Armies of Occupation after the 31st August, and the larger question of the International Bank, Mr. Snowden came to the main points of his criticism.   As regards the division of
the annuities into two categories, unconditional and conditional, the following extracts show his general line : &quot; As I have just said, the British Government make no objection indeed, they welcome the amount of the annuities and the scale, but we do offer some objection in regard to the proposal to divide them into two categories.******It might not matter very much if there had been a fair, proper and just apportionment of the unconditional annuities between the various countries, but that is not the case. France, for instance, gets five-sixths of the uncon-ditional annuities; Italy gets a very considerable annual sum, amounting in English money to over  2,000,000 a year. The Dawes Loan requires a little over  4,000,000 a year, and after you have taken the French and the Italian shares and the service of the Dawes Loan,, you have a sum which is quite negligible to be divided amongst the other creditor Powers. Excuse me if I speak frankly and firmly. To our mind this is utterly indefensible, and the Experts make no attempt whatever either to explain it or to justify it or to defend it. There is, of course, a suggestion that France, which is the country which is taking five-sixths of the unconditional annuities, should put up a small guarantee fund of  25,000,000. We do not attach very great importance to that, because, in the case of a postponement of the postponable annuities, that sum would not go very far when divided amongst those countries who depend almost wholly upon the postponable annuities; it would not go very far to provide them with the annuities which had been postponed.&quot;15. In regard to the modification of the Spa percentages, Mr. Snowden spoke as follows : &quot; I come to another matter to which the British Government attach the greatest possible importance, and that is the modification which has been made in the Report in the distribution of the annuities amongst the various creditor nations, which is a departure from the agreements which already exist, and, unfortunately, this division is very much to the disadvantage of certain creditor countries, and very much to the advantage of other creditor countries. Great Britain is a very severe sufferer by this suggested alteration of the distribution of the annuities, and some of the smaller nations which are represented here this afternoon will also suffer.******Now this is the first time that a suggestion has ever been made that there should be a departure from the Spa percentages. Article 237 of the Treaty of Versailles has the effect that the creditors&apos; shares must be fixed before Germany&apos;s liabilities are assessed, and I ask the attention of the Delegates particularly to this, that the shares of the creditor Powers, having been once fixed, are not to be changed with any change that may be made in the German payments. Now the Spa percentages were fixed nine years ago, in 1920, and I believe that there have been eight Conferences since that date dealing with the question of reparations in one form or another, and this is the first time that any suggestion has been raised that there should be a change in the percentages which were then fixed. The question was never raised when the Dawes Report was under consideration, and I submit, Sir, that the Experts had no authority whatever under their terms of reference to interfere with the existing arrangements for the distribution of the annuities. As a matter of fact but this, perhaps, might be more appropriately dealt with when we come to consider this matter more fully in the Commission when the Young Committee was appointed, it was agreed amongst the principal creditor Powers that there should be no interference with the existing percentages. The effect of the reduction, as I said, is very heavy upon some of the countries, and it falls upon those countries which do not share at all in the mobilisable part of the annuities. For instance, Great Britain will lose under the proposed scale of distribution over 48 million marks a year; France, in addition to receiving five-sixths of the unconditional annuities, will gain 10-7 million marks; Italy will gain 36-8 million marks; Belgium, 12-2 million marks; while Japan, &apos; Serbia, Greece, Roumania and the United States will lose small amounts.&quot;
16. Mr. Snowden then went on to explain that under the Young Report we should get nothing towards the  200,000,000 paid to the United States in excess of the payments from our creditors on account of their debts to us. He made the further point &quot; that the security for our payments to the United States of America cannot be regarded as the highest class of security in comparison with the unconditional part of the Young annuities.&quot;17. In regard to Deliveries in Kind, Mr. Snowden left the case to be developed at a later meeting by the President of the Board of Trade, and he concluded-hy summing up the main points he wished to place before the Conference as follows : &quot; There is the question of the position and distribution of the unconditional and conditional annuities. There is the question of the Spa percentages for distribution and the question of Deliveries in Kind.&quot;Referring more specifically to the question of distribution of annuities, Mr. Snowden said : &quot; The British Houses of Parliament will never agree to any further sacrifices of British interests in this matter. There are no divisions between the Parties upon this question in Great Britain.....&quot;After Mr. Snowden&apos;s speech the Conference adjourned. There is no doubt that this speech, delivered at the very outset of the Conference, caused a great sensation far greater, as has been observed, than should have been the case if the other Delegates at the Conference had been properly informed as to the debate in the House of Commons on the 26th July. The replies made at the two sessions on the following day, the 7th August, though moderate in tone, gave a fairly clear indication of the lines on which opinion was divided. The French, Italian and Belgian Delegations, through the mouths of M. Ceron, M. Mosconi and M. Hymans, respectively, accepted the Report &quot;as an indivisible whole,&quot; laying stress on the passage in the Experts&apos; Report on this point. Mr. Adatci, on behalf of the Japanese Delegation, accepted the Report in principle as the basis &apos;&apos; for the final settlement of reparations and for a liquidation of the past.&quot; Dr. Stresemann stated that &quot; Germany declares her readiness to come to a solution of the reparation problem on the basis of the Young-Plan.&quot; The smaller Powers were unanimous in their criticisms, though the grounds of their objection varied in each case. Roumania, Portugal, the Serb-Croat-Slovene State, protested against the departure from the Spa percentages. M. Venizelos, for Greece, complained of &quot;very unfavourable treatment in the Plan.&quot; Very few detailed criticisms were made against Mr. Snowden&apos;s three points, and these can be passed over for the moment, as they were more fully developed in the Financial Commission, to the proceedings of which we will now pass.18. On the next day, Thursday, the 8th August, the Conference went into Commission, and the two main Commissions already alluded to met for the first time at 4 p.m., which, incidentally, strained the exiguous resources of the improvised Secretariat-General to extreme limits, though, the difficulties were successfully surmounted. On that morning it had hot been Mr. Snowden&apos;s intention to speak. The course of events, however, compelled him to return to the charge. For, during the day, information began to pour in from all sorts of quarters, more especially from the journalists, that the Chancellor was supposed to be bluffing, and, from this point of view, a re-statement of his case appeared desirable by the afternoon. It was, however, the events at the Commission itself that precipitated this second speech. After M. Marinkovitch had once more emphasised that, for the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the Spa percentages were absolutely final and could not be reduced without their consent, the Chairman (Baron Houtart) asked authority to prepare a programme of work to lay before the Commission on the following day, with a view to the setting up of a number of Sub-Committees. It was at this point that the Chancellor of the Exchequer intervened, in a speech somewhat stiffer in tone than the one he had delivered at the Plenary Meeting. Its tenor is revealed by the following extracts : &quot;Mr. Chairman, I quite agree with what you have said that it will be desirable to draw up a programme for the consideration of the Sub-Committees after we have got an idea of the points to which the Commission attaches importance. The Commission will be aware from what I said the other day that there are two or three matters arising out of the Report to which the British Government attach supreme importance, and indeed I may emphasise
what I said the other day by declaring now that the British Delegation must have an assurance that the three main points I raised the other day, namely, the distribution of the annuities, the unconditional part of the annuities and deliveries in kind, must be considered and some decision must be reached before the British Delegation can take part in the discussion- of any further matters arising out of the Report. The Experts&apos; Report says in two or three places that the Governments must accept the Young Plan in principle before they proceed to the appointment of certain Committees, such as the Committee to deal with tho alteration of the German Taws and the Bank project, and one or two other matters.,J&quot;Passing to the comments on his previous speech, Mr. Snowden continued : &quot;&apos; I hope my remarks will not be regarded as being in the least offensive if I say that there was no reply whatever given to any one of the arguments which 1 advanced, and no figure which I gave was challenged. Indeed all the speeches which were made yesterday purporting to be criticisms of my speech might be summarised in one sentence, namely, that we must accept the Young Report as a whole, that it is indivisible, that if any changes are made in the Report the whole structure will fall. . .&quot; In regard to the first of these points we do not accept the statement of the Experts that the Report is indivisible. If that were so we should not be here at all .... But all the changes we have asked for could be made within the structure of the Report without in the least undermining the foundations of that Report.&quot;19. Turning to M. Cheron&apos;s speech at the Plenary Conference and his talk about French &quot; sacrifices,&quot; Mr. Snowden continued :  &quot; Now what were the sacrifices to which he referred, namely, that the amount of the annuities will be smaller than the amount of the annuities which were fixed under the Dawes Plan. But I do not call that a sacrifice at all, because we are not making a sacrifice when we are giving up something which we should never have received. That is not a sacrifice at all, and even if it were a sacrifice it is a sacrifice which every one of the creditor Powers is called upon to share proportionately. The French Finance Minister went so far as to claim as a sacrifice the loss of the prosperity index. That again is no sacrifice at all, but if we are to talk about sacrifices here then I have to say something about the sacrifices which the British Empire has made, As a matter of fact there is not a single one of the countries which were engaged in the War which has made anything at.all approaching the financial sacrifices which Great Britain has made .... No country was left at the end of the War with the Avar debt with which Great Britain was faced. We have a war debt now of  7,500 millions, which is more than double the war debt of any other nation which was engaged in the War. The taxation of our people is double per head of our population than any other country that took part in the War. I have to provide 125 million francs every day of the year for the service of our war debt.&quot;20. This theme was developed at some length. The generous and magnanimous character of our settlements with our late Allies was dwelt upon in considerable detail, stress being laid, for example, on the following fact: &quot; As a matter of fact we settled with Italy a debt of  560 millions for a present value of  78 millions, and if the proposal made in the Young Report were carried into effect we should have to sacrifice to Italy another  30 millions of that  78 millions. Therefore all that we should get from Italy for a loan which at the time of funding amounted to  560 millions is in effect no more than  48 millions.&quot;This part of the speech closed with the following : Therefore, if as a result of this Report we were called upon to make certain sacrifices, we should be perfectly within our moral rights if we insisted on a reconsideration of our present debt arrangements with them.&quot;
Turning to the distribution of the annuities, both conditional and unconditional, Mr. Snowden repeated that &quot;the Young Committee had no right whatever to interfere with the Spa percentages.&quot;He recalled that the French and Italian Governments were pledged, before the Expert Committee was set up, that there should be no interference with the Spa percentages.  He dwelt also shortly on the question of Deliveries in Kind.  He their&quot; went on to make an important declaration in regard to his position, as shown by the following extracts : &quot; I conclude by saying this. We must have a decision upon these questions before we proceed any further, and I wish to submit to the Commission aResolution on this matter for which I shall ask approval.....&quot;&apos;1 I have behind me the unanimous support of my Government, the support of the House of Commons irrespective of Party, and the support, I believe, of the whole of the people of Great Britain.   Upon this matter I am speakingquite frankly.   We cannot compromise.....&quot;-&apos;&apos; The Young Report states that before it can come into operation it must be ratified by the Governments concerned, and I want to tell this Conference that the British House of Commons will never ratify this Young Report in the form in which it is at present. Suppose that we here were to accept it, supposing the British Government were to accept it, what would happen ? We might go back to the House of Commons and submit it to the House of Commons, but the House of Commons would not accept it, the Country would not accept it, and therefore all the work would have to be begun all over again, and I am quite sure that that is a situation which every one of us would deplore, and every effort should be made at this Conference to avoid such a catastrophe as that.&quot;&apos; He concluded by submitting the following Resolutions :  &quot; That a Sub-Committee of Treasury Experts should be appointed to consider and submit proposals for the settlement of any questions raised in regard to the amount and the method of payment of the annuities provided for in the Young Plan, and (without the German representatives) to revise the scheme of distribution of these annuities so as to bring it into accord with the existing inter-Allied agreement.&quot;21. Mr. Snowden&apos;s speech, as might have been expected, elicited several replies. His resolution, in particular, encountered opposition. M. Cheron, for example, strongly opposed it, saying :  &quot;It is impossible to attempt any alteration in the distribution of the annuities, and in particular the French share and the form given to that share. I state this quite clearly and definitely, and I would add that it will be impossible for us to change our views on this point.&quot;This point of view7 was emphasised in his final words :  &apos;&apos; If the suggestion is to try and make a new plan, and in particular a new distribution, then I can only say I would not accept it.&quot;M. Jaspar took a similar line :  &quot; It would be impossible,&quot; he said, &quot; and even dangerous to attempt to do again the work of the Experts .... If we want a result we ought not to have a Sub-Committee to discuss the revision of the distribution of the annuities.&quot;M. Pirelli, who pointed out that there had been no agreed record of a conversa-tion he had had with Mr. Churchill (on a British note of which Mr. Snowden had relied) stoutly repudiated the suggestion that Italy had ever agreed to the maintenance of the Spa percentages, and in all the circumstances Mr. Snowden did not think it necessary to press the point. The other speeches need not be summarised in detail, but this is a convenient point at which to sum up the replies, such as they were, delivered partly in the earlier Plenary Sessions and partly in Committee to Mr. Snowden&apos;s speeches. In their main lines the comments of the French, Italian and Belgian Delegations were very similar in tenor.   They all
stressed the part that the Young Plan is a compromise. They all dwelt, somewhat unconvincingly, on their own sacrifices a point which Mr. Snowden dealt with rather crushingly in an extract already quoted.22. Mr. Snowden&apos;s claim that, in altering the Spa percentages, the Experts had gone outside their terms of reference, was disputed on the ground that it came within the instructions to draw up &apos;&apos; proposals for a complete and final settle-ment of the reparations problem.&quot; &quot;Agreement would have been impossible if we had not discussed distribution,&quot; said Mr. Pirelli, one of the Experts. The Italian Delegation, in particular, made the claim that the Spa percentages had not been altered so far as division of reparation payments by Germany was concerned, and that the alteration was only in respect of prior charges, &quot;as has happened innumerable times, e.g., in the case of the United States Claims, the Belgian war debt, &amp;c.&quot; Technically, then, it is true that the division of reparation payments is still in accordance with the Spa percentages, but the argument is really a quibble, as there is even less ground for altering the agreed share due to Great Britain in respect of the Belgian debt than for altering the agreed share of reparations, and the important question is the loss to this country resulting from the Young Report as a whole.23. By the end, then, of the first meeting of the Financial Commission the divergence between Great Britain and the other Creditor Powers had become strongly marked, and, in order to obtain breathing space, the Commission was adjourned for two days, i.e., until the morning of Saturday, the 10th August. Some difficulty was experienced in finding business for Saturday&apos;s meeting, but, on the suggestion of the Secretary-General, it was decided to limit it to a general discussion on deliveries in kind. Mr. Snowden only agreed to this on condition that the discussion was treated as a continuation of the general debate, and that Mr. Graham&apos;s speech, which was to come first, was to be regarded as an extension of his own exposition of the British case. The Chancellor made this stipulation in order to ensure that the debate was not used as a pretext for burking his insistence on a decision on his three points before proceeding further. It may be admitted quite frankly that the debate on deliveries in kind was undertaken at this particular moment in.order to maintain a facade of progress while the problem of Mr. Snowden&apos;s three points was being considered behind the scenes.24. On Saturday, the 10th August, the debate in the Finance Commission opened quietly. Mr. Graham&apos;s moderate and persuasive opening speech on Deliveries in Kind met with a particularly favourable reception. But this calm proved to be only the prelude to a stormy and difficult day. M. Cheron, ignoring the understanding that the debate was to be confined to deliveries in kind, and without any remonstrance from the Chair, rose to reply once more to Mr. Snowden. He made it clear that he did so owing to the reproaches cast upon him in the French Press for the inadequacy of his earlier reply. In this speech the French Minister of Finance contested Mr. Snowden&apos;s arguments that the Spa percentages -had not been adhered to; that the French Government had failed in their undertaking in this respect; that the Experts had gone beyond their terms of reference; that the division between the conditional and unconditional part of the annuities, and the distribution of the latter, was unfair; and that the guarantee fund to be provided by France was insufficient. His arguments were on the same lines as those already summarised, but developed in greater detail and accompanied by figures. This brought Mr. Snowden to his feet. After commenting on the fact that M. Cheron&apos;s &quot;departure from the understanding that the debate was to be confined to deliveries in kind had taken him by surprise, Mr. Snowden continued : &quot; I do not accept a single one of his arguments, and I do not accept the accuracy of the figures that he has put forward. If this were the occasion to go into details I could refute every one of the constructions which M. Cheron has placed upon these figures. It is not true to say that Great Britain does not suffer in the proposed distribution under the Young Plan in comparison Avith the distribution which we receive under existing agreements. The interpreta-tion that was placed by M. Cheron upon the Balfour Note was, if the expression may be permitted, wholly inaccurate* to anybody who understands the character of the Note, and I must protest emphatically against the repeated statements made by M. Cheron that the British Experts acted under the instructions of the* The original words used were &quot; grotesque and ridiculous.&quot;   See below.[19849] c
British Treasury. That certainly is not true, and, further, the quotation that was given by M.. Cheron from Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement in the House of Commons is wholly inaccurate. Mr. Churchill pointed out that we were not getting more, and quite possibly less, than the cover for our future payments, and that no provision was made whatever for the arrears of  200,000,000 in respect of our payments to the United States of America.*X* -Jf- ^* -5^* -Ji-I am as anxious as any member of this Commission to come to an agree-ment which will be mutually satisfactory and which will place this vexed question upon a permanent foundation, but, as I said the other day, there can be no settlement unless it is a settlement based upon justice. This general debate will have to come to a close very soon. My resolution is before the Commission, and I cannot accept the postponement of a decision upon that resolution much longer.* * * * * *If one thing is put beyond all dispute, it is the promise by M. Poincare to Mr. Churchill that there would be no interference with the Spa percentages on the unconditional annuities, whereas practically all as a matter of fact, five-sixths of the unconditional annuities go to France. Great Britain&apos;s share is negligible. The share of the smaller Powers, if I might so put it, is less than negligible, and whatever dispute there may be as to whether the annuities proposed are regulated and distributed by the Spa percentages, there can be no dispute about the definite pledge given to Mr. Churchill that the Spa percentages would be applied to any mobilisable part of the annuities, which certainly has not been kept, and I repeat what I said the other day, that this is a matter in which the honour of one country, at any rate, is involved.&quot;25. After accepting M. Pirelli&apos;s interpretation of the undertaking by Italy to respect the Spa percentages, to which he had referred earlier, the Chancellor closed as follows : &quot; I have nothing further to say except to repeat what I said just now. I have put my case fairly and frankly before this Commission, and it is now for the Commission to decide what action should be taken.&quot;26. As the day (Saturday, the 10th August) wore on the situation got worse. First, there was a violent reaction on the part of the French to the words &quot; grotesque and ridiculous &quot; which Mr. Snowden had used in describing M. Cheron&apos;s interpretation of the BalfOur Note. This storm in a teacup was apparently due to one of those differences in the precise meaning in the two languages of words which are identical in form. When this was explained, Mr. Snowden at once withdrew the phrase, and it was eventually cleared up by a communique^ but for a time the incident had an ugly appearance.27. A still more embarrassing episode on this Saturday was the arrival of a message from the Prime Minister to the effect that his information was worsening from all sides and that before a break occurred he relied on the Delegates to get into touch with him and perhaps to meet him. Through the mistake of a subordinate in a Government Department this message (of which, we need hardly say, we have nothing to complain) was despatched en clair by telephone. On the day of arrival the Secretary had warned the Delegation that telephone messages were liable to be tapped, but this was not realised by the junior official who passed the message from the Treasury. This error of judgment was at once recognised as disastrous. Mr. Snowden&apos;s greatest difficulty had been to convince the foreign delegations that he was not bluffing. Just as he had brought this home to them, this message, had been received and was certain to leak out. Consequently the Chancellor asked for a public statement by the Prime Minister of his own and the Government&apos;^ support. The Prime Minister responded handsomely and at once. It was Mr. Snowden&apos;s intention to read his statement to the Financial Commission on Monday, the 12th August. M. Jaspar, however, urged that &quot; the patient is so weak that this will kill him,&quot; and the message was given to the Press instead, and produced a marked and notable effect. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that in fact the original message did leak out, and for days the Press correspondents were enquiring about
some alleged private message from the Prime Minister on lines quite different from his public pronouncement. The intractable attitude during the whole of the follow-ing week of the foreign Delegations in regard to Mr. Snowden&apos;s three points may probably be ascribed to that leakage. Immediate steps were taken to place our telephone communications with England on a secure footing, but this particular error once made could&quot; not be overtaken.28. The first week of the Conference then closed on a gloomy note. The atmosphere was highly charged : the foreign Delegations in perplexity and doubt; the promising start of the Political Commission on the question of the evacuation of the Rhineland threatened with a hold-up pending progress in the Financial Commission, which latter was rapidly approaching a deadlock. In these circumstances it was arranged that the Delegates of the Six Inviting Powers should meet privately on Sunday morning (the 11th August) at the Binnenhof to discuss procedure. There were to be no secretaries or experts present only the Secretary-General and some interpreters. As often happens on such occasions, the real business was done outside and before the meeting in private conversations which began between M. Jaspar and Mr. Snowden. As a result, it was arranged that British, French, Belgian, Italian and Japanese experts should meet informally to discuss how Mr. Snowden&apos;s claims could be met. This having been arranged beforehand, the present meeting of Delegates assumed a somewhat perfunctory form, being taken up for the most part with allegations by M. Francqui and M. Pirelli that the British Experts on the Young Commission had in fact been instructed by the Treasury and the British Government allegations that were repudiated by Mr. Snowden. The only relieving feature in this rather barren meeting was a delightful exchange of courtesies between Mr. Snowden and M. Cheron, which cleared up the &quot; grotesque and ridiculous &quot; incident of the day before and sent everyone away in good humour.. With the atmosphere restored and the experts in contact, therefore, the gloom in which the previous week had closed was cleared away.29. It is unnecessary at this stage to dwell upon the meetings of the Financial Commission which took place on Monday, the 12th August, and Wednesday, the 14th August, to continue the debate on the deliveries in kind. It suffices to record that the speeches were all moderate in tone and sympathetic, to Mr. Graham&apos;s presentation of the British case. After Wednesday, the 14th August, the Financial Commission was brought to a standstill for lack of material. Mr. Snowden was unwilling to set up formal Committees until he received satisfaction on his three points; and his opponents refused to discuss his resolution, which remained on the table, M. Venizelos (with our consent) having added as a complement to it the following : &quot;That the study of a simultaneous and final settlement of all the outstanding debts arising out of the Treaties of Peace be included in the programme of the labour of the Sub-Commissions to be set up, and, if necessary, be entrusted to a special Committee.&quot;In these circumstances the Financial Commission was adjourned until Saturday, the 17th August, and a few days later it was again adjourned &quot;at the call of the Chair.&quot; The Political Commission also stood adjourned at the call of the Chair from the 12th August.30. The fact is that the focus of interest had transferred itself from the Financial Commission to the informal meetings of the Experts, which began on Monday, the 12th August, in Mr. Leith Ross&apos;s room at the Grand Hotel, Scheveningen. Unless they could find a way to satisfy Mr. Snowden, there was no chance of making progress in any of the official organisations of the Conference, which (apart from some inquiries by the Jurists&apos; Committee in regard to Conciliation and Verification in the Rhineland) were reduced to complete stagnation. To these meetings, then, and to the offers and negotiations which resulted from them we must shortly turn.British Delegation Organisation.31.   Before doing so, however, we think it would interest the Cabinet to know of a development in our Delegation organisation which, we think, proved a source of co-ordination and unity.   Up to the end of the first week we had relied for these [19849] c 2
purposes on informal conversations! So long as the business was being conducted in Plenary Conference or formal Commissions with full records, this had proved adequate to our needs. Now, however, that we were entering an era of private meetings, personal conversations, tentative offers, and so forth, we felt that some closer system of co-ordination was needed. We therefore set on foot formal meetings of the three Delegates with such officials whose presence they might from time to time desire, and Avith Sir Maurice Hankey as Secretary, for the purpose of reviewing and concerting our policy and dealing with the varying situations which might develop from day to day, and, on occasions, from hour to hour. Our Secretary has kept notes of these meetings, which, though they do not take the shape of formal Minutes, nevertheless provide us with very useful material for reconstructing the situation at any moment, reminding us of our decisions, and recording Avhat occurred. .   .Experts&apos; Conversations.32. The first discussions of Mr. Leith Ross with the French, Belgian, Italian and Japanese Experts, which lasted throughout the afternoon of Sunday, the 11th August, Monday, the 12th August, and Tuesday, the 13th August, need not be dealt Avith at length. At no stage did the representatives of the Creditor Powers make any serious offer. It is understood that among the proposals which Mr. Leith Ross Avas considering Avith a view to securing solid satisfaction of our claim, and at the same time meeting in form the plea that the Young Plan was indivisible, were the following : (1.) Sum required to be re-funded (mainly by France) in order to provide full debt cover during the transitional yearSurplus under the Dawes Plan, assuming that it stops at the end of AugustGold deposited by Italy in London during the war 5,000,000 to7,000,000 15,000,00022,000,000The plan provides that this adjust-ment. should be made in favour of Great Britain, but the method of payment was left unsettled.Suggested that this should accrue entirely to Great Britain.Dawes LoanThe arrangement under the Italian Debt Agreement to pay this back by instalments to come to an end. 4,400,000   Some arrangement to be arrived at Avhereby this was to be provided either out of the French share of the unconditional annuity or by Germany as an addition to the unconditional annuity at the ex-pense of the conditional.    The amount of unconditional annuity thus liberated, together with the existing free balance (^61,400,000), to be allocated to Great Britain ; France to buy off smaller Powers. (2.) The French priority on the unconditional annuity to be adjusted out of any part of the postponable annuities paid, so that the French would get no advantage so long as Germany paid not less than  50 millions a year; and the Guarantee Fund to be raised from  25,000,000 to  40,000,000, which would secure Great Britain, in the event of a German default, for two years.    Thus, except in regard to mobilisation of the Debt, our share Avould be as good as that of anyone else.(3.) The bank would be in London; and the Dominions to have at least one seat on the Board.(4.) Deliveries of Reparation Coal to Italy by sea (which competes most directly with British coal exports) to be prohibited or at least restricted to one-third of the total coal deliveries to Italy.33. One cause of difficulty was the selection of the Experts of the other Creditor PoAvers. M. Quesnay, the French, M. Pirelli, the Italian, and M. Francqui, the Belgian, Delegates, had all been members of the Young Committee, and as such displayed, as they had done throughout the Conference, a parental affection for the Young Report. Such offers as they made were derisory, and need not be recorded here, in view of the sequel which will now be described.
The French-Belgian-Italian Offer.34. In consequence of the failure of the Experts to make any progress, Mr Snowden, on Wednesday, the 14th August, addressed the following letter to M. Jaspar : &quot;Dear Mr. Jaspar,Referring to my remarks to you about the deadlock on the Committee of Treasury Experts, I repeat that I must press for a definite decision on the points I have submitted to the Conference at an early date. I agree that it might be best to have a talk to-day among the heads of the other Creditor Powers, and if they desire I will submit my proposals, which are definitive, in writing. But they are known to you. The time has come for a decision, and I expect this by Friday evening, or the Session on Saturday will be futile. I repeat that on the matter of distribution I cannot accept anything less than the restitution of our share under existing agreements. I am very anxious that we should arrive at a friendly agreement.Yours sincerely, (Signed) Philip Snowden.&quot;35. Following this letter, the representatives of the other Creditor Powers went into Conference, and shortly after midday on the 16th August M. Jaspar handed to the Secretary-General a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering proposals to the British Delegation by the other Creditor Powers. The letter and the proposals are attached in Appendix I. Sir Maurice Hankey insisted on knowing the precise status of the letter, since on the previous day, at an interview with M. Cheron and M. Loucheur, there had been a proposal that he should be used as an intermediary to sound Mr.- Snowden informally as to whether any proposals they  might put forward would be acceptable as a basis for discussion. M. Loucheur had explained that the four Powers hesitated to court an open rejection,&quot; and eventually it had been agreed that if they put forward proposals in this form it should be on the understanding that, if non-acceptable, they should be regarded as non-existent. On the present occasion, however, this form of approach was not resorted tc. After telephonic inquiry of the French Delegation, M. Jaspar informed the Secretary-General that the note was to be considered as semi-official (&quot; officieuse &quot;), non-confidential, but not to be published without a fresh instruction. Further, if the Memorandum contained an acceptable basis for discussion, the pro-posals therein were to be clothed with figures at a meeting of Experts.35a. If the note in Appendix I is studied, it will be seen that the first five parts are devoted to an attempt to prove that the financial and economic advantages given to the British Empire by certain sections of the Young Plan would compensate for the sacrifices which the British Experts were able to accept in the distribution of the German annuity simultaneously with their acceptance of a reduction of the annuity. The last part contains certain proposals designed &quot; to offer further improvements in the British situation without touching the Plan.&quot; These proposals may be summed up as follows : (1.) An offer to allot to the British Empire a very large share in the amount to be redistributed out of the surplus which will be available out of the German payments in the last five months of the Dawes Plan, once the needs of the Creditor Powers have been covered during this transitional period, including the payments for external debts for the year ending the -    31st March, 1930.(2.) The allocation to Great Britain of the larger part of the balance of the unconditional annuity which remains available for distribution, and which (the note stated) represents the equivalent of a fixed annuity of 58 million marks during 37 years.(3.) As regards deliveries in kind, the new regulations to be drawn up under Article 138 of the Plan, Chapter VIII, and Article 191 of the Annexes (Annex VII) to specify certain advantages for Great Britain in connection with the,. Reparations Recovery Act so as to improve still further the nature of the British annuities received under the Recovery Act procedure.  Further, in drawing up the new regulations, certain
restrictions and guarantees as regards deliveries in kind to be laid down to give new safeguards to British commerce. (4.) As regards coal, certain States, while unable to renounce their right to receive deliveries altogether, were stated to be ready to meet the wishes of Great Britain on several of the points mentioned by her.The note concluded with a proposal that: &quot; If the British Delegation, in answer to the appeal of the other Delegations, share these views, it would seem desirable that the technical experts attached to the Delegations concerned should value exactly the various allocations described in outline above.&quot;36. M. Pirelli, who arrived during Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s conversation with M. Jaspar, made verbally the following additional offer, which Sir Maurice wrote down : &apos;&apos; Italy is prepared to consider turning over to Great Britain a share of the amounts which may accrue to Italy from the total payment of liberation bonds plus the value of ceded properties from the successor States of Austria and Hungary.&apos;&apos;37. The British Delegation met at once to examine this proposal, which was immediately realised to be wholly unsatisfactory. As the result of this meeting, the Chancellor of the Exchequer saw M. Jaspar at 4 p.m., and told him that the statement was quite unacceptable, and that it made no advance on previous offers; indeed, in some respects, it was less satisfactory than the talk between the Experts earlier in the week. He pressed him as to whether this was his last word. M. Jaspar replied : &quot; Well, I do not know. It is difficult for me to say that.&quot; He gave the impression that he himself was not at all satisfied with the answer; that if it rested with him there would be little difficulty in coming to an agreement; that they and the French, he thought, should work together and do something more satisfactory, but that the Italians were difficult. Mr. Snowden also proposed, and M. Jaspar agreed, that it would be desirable to postpone until Monday the meeting of the Financial Commission arranged for the following day (Saturday, the 17th August). The meeting was subsequently postponed at the call of the Chair. Mr. Snowden promised a reasoned reply to the offer of the other Creditor Powers.38. The Delegation met again the same evening (Friday, the 16th August) to approve the reply, which, together with the covering letter, is attached in Appendix II. There is no need to summarise the British Memorandum in the body of this Report, but the following extract from Mr. Snowden&apos;s letter requires quotation in full :-&quot; If the Conference is to arrive at the successful result which we all hope for it is essential that the other Creditor Governments should make a further and more serious effort to meet our position. We are claiming no unfair advantages; we are simply asking that the rights to Avhich we are entitled under existing agreements should be respected.   For this purpose means must be found (a) to restore to Great Britain (by means either of annual payments or an equivalent capital sum) the  2,400,000 a year which she loses under the distribution proposed by the Experts; or, more precisely,  2,000,000 a year in addition to the adjustment required to provide debt cover in the current year; and(b) to assure to Great Britain a share, approximating to, if not fullyequivalent to, the British percentage of the unconditional annuities.The question of deliveries in kind will, I hope, be found capable of arrangement, but it should be understood that we are not prepared to abandon the financial rights to which we are entitled in return for any concessions on other points.&quot;39. This reply was handed to the Secretary of the Belgian Delegation (M. Jaspar having retired to bed) by Sir Maurice Hankey at about midnight the same evening.40. The next development was at 9 p.m. on the evening of Saturday, the 17th August, when M. Jaspar called and was received by Mr. Snowden and Mr. Graham, to whom he handed a Memorandum (Appendix III) calling attention to a proposal at the end of their previous note (Appendix I) that &apos;&apos; technicians
Deliveries in Kind.42. Before passing to the week beginning Sunday, the 18th August, it will be convenient to refer to another matter on which private conversations had been taking place, namely, Deliveries in Kind.43. Reference has already been made to the reasonable response that was given to Mr. Graham&apos;s persuasive arguments, setting forth the British case on this subject. The result was the convening of informal meetings between representatives of Great Britain, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy, which were held at the Grand Hotel, Scheveningen, on the 13th and 15th August. The British representatives were Messrs. Ashley, Goodchild and Cole. In addition to these two meetings, Mr. Ashley, Mr. Goodchild, Mr. Cole and Mr. Fryer discussed with Signor Brocchi, the Italian representative, the question of reparation coal deliveries to Italy. The results of the informal Committee&apos;s meetings have been summarised by Mr. Goodchild as follows : &quot; It was only to be expected that the results of the Committee&apos;s work would be negative. There has, however, been a useful exchange of views. The main points which have emerged are as follows : I. No concession is likely to be obtained from Italy as regards coal, except as part of a wider arrangement. II. It is unlikely that deliveries in kind can be forthwith abolished. There is, for instance, the case of current contracts. The other Creditor Powers and Germany regard the Schedule of such deliveries in the Plan as a minimum.III. Our point about the Reparation Recovery Act being enforced pari passuwith deliveries (if any) during a moratorium is a useful check on such deliveries, and may in itself prevent them from materialising.IV. But if the principle of such deliveries be admitted, we can probablysecure adequate control thereof in the interests of British trade. This involves modification of paragraph 4 of Annex IV to the Plan.attached to the interested Delegations should meet in order to determine the value of the various allocations proposed in the Note and renewing this suggestion. The reason why no reference to this proposal had been made in the British reply was that the proposal had been subject to the British Delegation sharing the view of the other Creditor Powers that their proposals &quot; furnished to the British Empire means of obtaining real satisfaction.&quot; As the proposals of the other Creditor Powers had been rejected it followed that the meeting would not take place.41. In view of the inadequacy of the offer and the failure of the previous Expert conversations, Mr. Snowden and Mr. Graham at first had some hesitation in accepting the proposal. They felt, however, that it would be undesirable to risk the breakdown of the Conference until every opportunity had been given for expert or other review of the available documents. Consequently, while insisting that there must be no question of his going back on the central points in the British claim, Mr. Snowden agreed to the expert discussions on the following conditions. First, that the Experts selected should be Treasury Experts, and should not include any persons who had been members of the Young Commission. Second, that there should be no delay. Third, that the terms of reference, drafted by Mr. Graham in short-hand during the meeting, should be as follows :-&quot; The technicians to direct their minds exclusively to the statements in the two Memoranda, and especially to pronounce on the strict financial value to Great Britain of the offers in the Memorandum of the other Creditor Powers, and to report without delay.&quot; -M. Jaspar accepted these conditions for himself, and undertook to consult the other Creditor Powers. Sir Maurice Ffankey took a typewritten copy of these terms of reference to M. Jaspar at about 10-30 that evening, and, with Mr. Snowden&apos;s permission, pressed that the Experts should meet on the following day, Sunday, instead of on the Monday, in order to save time. M. Jaspar, however, thought this did not give him sufficient time to square the other interested Delegations, and had numerous other objections. Eventually, on the following day, Sunday, the 18th August, we learned that the conditions had been accepted.
V. There will probably be no difficulty in securing a suitable Regulation forbidding re-export, and in obtaining suppression of the clause in the Plan permitting cession of deliveries. VI. Throughout the discussions the British Representatives have reserved Great Britain&apos;s fundamental opposition to the whole system of deliveries in kind.&quot;The Third Week of the Conference. Stalemate.44. Sunday, the 18th August, was a comparatively quiet day, and nothing occurred which requires record. It provided a convenient opportunity for thinking over and taking stock of the situation.45. On Monday morning, the 19th August, the Delegation met at 10 o&apos;clock and were inclined to take a grave view of the situation. Nothing was expected to result from the Experts&apos; meeting,* which was intended merely to clothe with figures the unsatisfactory offer. It was unlikely to affect our own point of view. As yet there was no sign of a serious offer being made. The Delegation carefully considered the Cabinet Minute quoted earlier in this Report. They felt that they had faithfully carried out their instructions, but they could not disregard the possibility that during the week just beginning they might find themselves compelled, in accordance with their instructions, to consult the Cabinet, in view of the threat of a breakdown. They, therefore, placed themselves in communication with the Prime Minister, at Lossiemouth, as to the best means of effecting this, and various messages were exchanged. In addition, in order that they might have available the material on which to base their own advice to the Cabinet in the event of a breakdown, they instructed the various Sections of the Delegation to prepare appreciations of the effect of such an eventuality on the general, political, international, financial and economic situations. t46. By Monday evening there appeared to be a slight improvement in the situation. Mr. Snowden received and accepted an invitation from Mr. Aclatci, the Chief Japanese Delegate, to meet M. Briand and M. Loucheur the following day. Hints were received from the French financial experts that some move might be expected to result from this conversation. Owing to M. Briand&apos;s engagements this meeting did not take place until Tuesday, the 20th August, at 4 p.m. The Chancellor of the Exchequer came back from a two hours&apos; interview with the impression that the French and Belgian Delegations had at last appreciated the justice of his case, and were making a sincere effort to meet our requirements. This impression was confirmed when, later in the evening, M. Loucheur called on Mr. Leith-Ross, at the Grand Hotel, and told him that M. Briand had been gratified at the friendly character of the conversation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and had been deeply impressed by the determined manner in which the Chancellor had insisted that he must have satisfaction as regards the Spa percentages. He admitted that if the Report had still been under discussion privately, the French Government would have no objection to altering the table of distribution, but once it had been published any change in that table would be out of the question. In an endeavour to give some compensation to Great Britain for the loss she had suffered, without altering the table in the Plan, he indicated that France and the Powers, other than Italy, might join together to guarantee to Great Britain one-half of the loss we complained of, i.e., 24,000,000 marks ( 1,200,000) out of the 48,000,000 marks ( 2,400,000) annual value. In this half of our desiderata would have to be included the annual equivalent of the 100,000,000 marks ( 5,000,000) capital adjustment in respect of the War Debt Cover during the first vear. as well as the  10,000.000 to  12,500,000 (200,000,000 to 250,000,000 marks) cash out of the surplus of the last five months of the Dawes Plan, which France would try and secure for Great Britain; and, further, they would guarantee that this would be found, if necessary, out of their future reparation receipts. The balance of our deficit we must arrange as best we could with the Italians, but he was not hopeful of our being able to do so.* This forecast proved correct, for after working for the whole of two days the experts produced a report which showed that in many points it was impossible to convert the proposals into figures, while on^ other points agreement was not reached.
47. It is perhaps worthy of note that more than one member of the Delegation and its Staff observed at a Party given by the Municipality the same evening a markedly greater cordiality towards us by members of the French Delegation than had hitherto been the case. Before examining M. Loucheur&apos;s proposal the British Delegation thought it advisable to await an interview which Mr. Snowden had arranged with M. Pirelli. This interview took place on Wednesday, the 21st August, at 10 a.m. Apparently M. Pirelli had nothing definite to suggest beyond^a share of the amounts which might accrue to Italy from the total payments of liberation bonds plus the value of ceded properties from the successor States of Austria and Hungary, which is referred to above in paragraph 36. As regards the Italian gold referred to in paragraph 32 M. Pirelli could offer no hope of an arrange-ment since this money appears in the accounts of the Bank of Italy as cover for the issue of banknotes. His main argument was that Italy had failed to secure what was due to her in reparations from the Successor States of the old Austrian Empire, and that the Young Commission had recognised this and had allotted these additions to German payments in order to recoup them.48. The Franco-Belgian offer was estimated at less than 50 per cent, of the British demand.49. Such was the position when a meeting of the Delegates of the Six Inviting Powers took place in a Committee Room of the First Chamber of the States-General at 5-30 p.m. on Wednesday, the 2lst August. This meeting had been demanded by the Germans in a letter addressed by Dr. Stresemann to the Delegations of the Inviting Powers on the previous day. The reason given in this request was the approach of the 1st September, the day suggested in the Young Report for the beginning of a new scale of payments. It had been noted that the German Delegation had for some days been betraying anxiety on this point. For example, in an interview with Mr. Snowden and Mr. Graham on the 19th August, Dr. Curtius and Dr. Hilferding emphasised the difficulty they would find in meeting the Dawes annuity and the possibility of a political and economic crisis in Germany, and had suggested some form of transitional arrangement substantially to the following effect: That as from a date to be fixed, the annuities on the Young Plan basis should be brought into force, giving Germany immediate relief from the higher Dawes annuity and leaving to the Creditor Powers to make such arrangements as were possible under any agreement subsequently reached. The suggestion was virtually a plea for a guarantee of the lower annuities payable by Germany under the Young Plan.50. The meeting took place at 5-30 on the 21st August. All the Delegates of the Six Inviting Powers were present, and M. Jaspar took the Chair. Dr. Stresemann, as we rather anticipated, took the line indicated in the preceding paragraph. He pointed out that the Conference had been summoned to consider the Young Report, the principal part of which was devoted to the revised German payments and the arrangements for putting them into execution. Instead of devoting itself to its main task, which was to complete the details of the Young scheme and the machinery for putting it into operation, the Conference had already spent two weeks on the secondary question of the division of the German payments among the Creditor Powers, and had not even succeeded in reaching agreement. Emphasising that we were now within ten days of the 1st September, the day fixed by the Experts for the inauguration of the Young Plan, Dr. Stresemann dwelt at some length on the political dangers of any further delay. The German Govern-ment had had a difficult task to induce German public opinion to accept the Plan, and, in fact, could only secure acceptance to a scheme involving so great payments over a long period of time provided that complete German sovereignty was recognised over the whole territory. He also touched on the financial and economic risks of delay, which would not only involve the most serious consequences to Germany, but must react throughout the world. He concluded with a proposal for a provisional arrangement under which the German payments under the Young Plan would be substituted, as from the 1st September, for the Dawes payments, while the Allies settled their difficulties. M. Briand opposed the proposal, on the ground that it amounted to a new Plan. There were, in fact, two plans, the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. If the. latter came to birth, the former would die; if the Young Plan were rejected, the Dawes Plan would continue. Mr. Snowden expressed sympathy with Dr. Stresemann&apos;s difficulties, but felt that his proposal would prove [19849] d
neither practicable nor acceptable to some of the Powers. The Young Plan, he pointed out, had really been rather premature, since Germany so far had paid out of Loans from abroad, and the scheme of transfer had never been tested out. He thought Dr. Stresemann probably exaggerated the dangers of a delay in adopting the Young Plan. The proper thing to do was to reach agreement, and for this the other Creditor Powers ought to make a supreme final effort to accommodate themselves to the demands of the British Delegation. The latter had not been unreasonable, and if they could get a proper settlement on the question of the per-centages and a reasonable settlement on Deliveries in Kind, the main difficulties would be cleared away and the Conference would be able to get on with its work.51. When the meeting of the Delegates of the Six Powers was resumed on the morning of Thursday, the 22nd August, it was decided to push on immediately and uninterruptedly with conversations in regard to Mr. Snowden&apos;s three points with a view to reaching a decision. At Mr. Henderson&apos;s suggestion, the conversations were to be reported to a further meeting on the following day at 3-30. If by that time no agreement had been reached, it was understood that a Plenary Meeting of the Conference would be held on Saturday, the 24th August. Dr. Stresemann, while not pressing for the moment his proposal for a provisional arrangement based on the application of the Young scale of payments by Germany from the 1st September onwards, reserved his right to reopen the matter at the Plenary Meeting if agreement had not been reached.52. . The conversations referred to above resulted in a fresh offer by the other Inviting Powers, communicated verbally by M. Jaspar towards midnight, - Thursday, the 22nd /23rd August. Particulars are given in Appendix IV. It will be seen that, according to the calculations of the other Creditor Powers, its value is  1,430,000; according to our calculation,  1,295,000. The difference is due to the actuarial calculation made as to the annual value of the total cash payments of  15,000,000, which they valued at 6^ per cent, and we at 5-^ per cent., the latter being the figure used for such calculations in the Young Report. Mr. Snowden reserved hi-s reply until he had consulted his colleagues. The British Delegation met at 10 a.m. on Friday, the 23rd August, and agreed to Mr. Snowden&apos;s view that the offer was quite unacceptable. In view of what now seemed the almost inevitable prospect of an early deadlock, they telegraphed to the Prime Minister asking if a Cabinet Meeting could be held at The Hague on Sunday, the 25th August. M. Jaspar called for his reply at 11 a.m., accompanied by M. Francqui, and Mr. Snowden informed him that the plan was unacceptable.53. At the moment of closing this Memorandum it is understood that M. Jaspar, the principal intermediary, is engaged yet once again in the arduous task of producing another &quot; final offer.&quot; To give him a little more time, the meeting of Delegations arranged for the afternoon of Friday, the 23rd August, has been postponed until the afternoon of Saturday, the 24th August, and the Plenary Meeting canvassed for Saturday afternoon will presumably not take place, at any rate, until the coming week. To attempt to prophesy of what the new offer will consist would be hazardous.Grand Hotel, Scheveningen, Holland, August 23, 1929.
APPENDIX I.(Confidential.)Reparations.Letter from M. Jaspar to the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering Proposals to the *j British Delegation by the other Creditor Powers.Belgian Delegation, The Hague, Dear Mr. Snowden, A ugust 16, 1929.FOLLOWING the interviews which M. Francqui and myself have had with you in the name of the French, Italian, Japanese and Belgian Delegations, the heads of these Delegations, in conformity with the idea expressed by the Communique&apos; proposed on the 14th August by Baron Houtart, President of the Financial Commis-sion. and unanimously adopted by that Commission, met yesterday. They have drafted, and have asked me to transmit to you, the Note which you will find attached and which sets out their views.They think that this will furnish the reply to the desire expressed in the letter which you addressed to me on the 14th August. They earnestly desire on their side to arrive at an agreement which will assure a successful result of the work of the Conference.(Signed) HENRI JASPAR.Note.The experts, after a thorough study of Germany&apos;s capacity of payment, drew up, in virtue of the Geneva decision of the 16th September, 1928, a proposal for a complete and final settlement of the reparation, problem.They fixed the flat German annuity at 2,050 million gold marks during 37 years, a figure which the experts of the Creditor Powers only accepted in integral conjunc-tion with a distribution which they regarded as conforming to the rights and needs of their respective countries.Only the British Empire now raises objections to this proposal. Although the other creditor Powers have given their adhesion to the work of the experts, they wish, with a lively desire that the Conference should- succeed, to underline the important advantages which the Young Plan provides for the British Empire, and even to find out whether, without impairing the Plan, additional satisfaction can be given to the British Empire.It must, in fact, be clearly understood that the Powers who have given their adhesion to the Plan do not intend in any form to reopen the work of the experts. They consider it to be a whole, a compromise. It represents a share of sacrifice for each of the States concerned.If its integrity is impaired, an era of very serious difficulties would be opened, of which the result would be uncertain and the consequences extremely grave.It is under cover of this declaration of principle that the following observations are presented.The British Delegation^ claims relate to three points :  (1.) The amount of the annuities.(2.) The quality of the annuities allotted to the British Empire. (3.) Deliveries in kind.II.As regards the amount of the annuities^, the British Delegates complain of a loss of about 45 million marks a year on the flat annuity calculated from 1929 to 1965 (2,050 million marks).      *We point out 1. That over and above the sums which are allotted to her out of this annuity, paragraph 193 of the annexes of the Plan gives Great Britain a very important advantage, the complete cover for her first year of debt payments.She will thus receive over and above the annuities of the Young Plan a repayment of about 100 million marks, provided by means of the sacrifice by other creditor Powers of part of their own receipts in respect of the 5 months of the Dawes Plan in 1929.[19849]e
This is indisputably a special advantage, which represents an annuity of about 7 millions for 37 years, an unconditional annuity which may be regarded as already mobilised at 6^ per cent, plus amortisation.2. Paragraph 142 of the Plan relieves the British Empire from the obligation of accounting for the net balance of the proceeds of liquidation of sequestrated property which ought to have been debited* to Germany and redistributed for the great part among the other creditor Powers.It should be emphasised that paragraph 193 of Annex VII (Distribution) deprives the latter Powers of the right to claim this.The net balance thus allotted to the British Empire has been estimated at a considerable figure. This figure has never been exactly given, but it evidently represents, even taking into account certain set-offs, a sum sufficient to ensure that the corresponding annuity added to that set out above, is such as to reduce very considerably if not to extinguish the decrease in percentage referred to by Great Britain.III.With regard to the quality of the annuities, the British Empire claims that it has not received any share of the divisible total of the unconditional annuity. To this the following reply may be made : 1. The application of the principle of Debt cover assures to the British Empire more than the share in the first ten annuities which ought to be allotted to it under existing agreements. The fact that the British Empire thus receives more quickly, and (so to say) in anticipation, its average annuity improves the quality of the British annuities.2. A substantial part of the conditional annuities allotted to the British Empire is received by it in sterling through the operation of the Recovery Act. The amounts coming to us in this way vary from 173 mill. Marks in the first year, to 69 mill. Marks in the tenth.The security for these conditional annuities is thus improved to a remarkable degree.3. All the sums received in the form of capital over and above the British share in the German annuity of 2,050 mill. R.M. (the sums of which we have spoken at the beginning of the present note) are unconditional in the best sense, since from the start they represent unconditional annuities already mobilised.4. The disadvantages which might result from the allocation made in the Young Plan out of the unconditional annuities are avoided in the event of the postponement of transfer, as provided in the Plan, by the setting up of the Guarantee Fund.IV.On deliveries in kind, the following advantages are forthcoming :  1. Limitation to ten years.2. Reduction at the start by about 50 per cent. 3. Rapid progressive reduction.4. Maintenance for the British Empire of the power to take up its share of deliveries in kind by the operation of the Recovery Act.V.It follows from the above statements that the financial and economic advantages given to the British Empire by certain sections of the Young Plan compensate for the sacrifices which the British Experts were able to accept in the distribution of the German annuity simultaneously with their acceptance of the reduction of the annuity.We do not think, therefore, that the British Empire is justified in claiming further advantages and, in any case, we cannot accept a modification of the distribution of the German annuities.* ? Credited.
2122.6However, as we have to settle certain questions, the solution of which the Young Plan has left to the Governments, we are ready to seek the solutions of those questions in a generous spirit of conciliation towards the British Empire in order to offer further improvements in the British situation without touching the Plan.VI.Concerning the question of the &quot; amount&quot; outside the annuity of 2,050 million marks already distributed, the Young Plan provides for the redistribution (paragraph 84 of the Plan) of the surplus which will be available out of the German payments in the last five months of the Dawes Plan, once the needs of the Creditor Powers have been covered during this transitional period, including the payments for external debts for the year ending the 31st March, 1930.We are ready, as far as we are concerned, in order to reach an agreement, to allot to the British Empire a very large share in the amount to be redistributed. This would be in addition to the advantages referred to in PartTI of this note.As regards the nature of the annuities, the Creditor Powers are ready to consider the allocation to Great Britain of the larger part of the balance of the unconditional annuity which remains available for distribution, which represents the equivalent of a fixed annuity of 58 million marks during 37 years.As regards deliveries in kind, under Article 138 of the Plan, Chapter VIII, and Article 191 of the Annexes (Annex VII), new regulations in regard to deliveries in kind are to be laid down by agreement between the Governments. These new regulations might specify certain advantages for Great Britain in connexion with the Recovery Act so as to improve still further the nature of the British annuities received under the Recovery Act procedure.Further, in drawing up the new regulations, certain restrictions and guarantees as regards deliveries in kind can be laid down to give new safeguards to British commerce.As regards coal, certain States particularly concerned in the importation of coal, while they cannot renounce their right to receive deliveries altogether, are ready to meet the wishes of Great Britain on several of the points mentioned by her.The Creditor Powers consider that they thus make manifest their strong desire to reach agreement, and that, without altering the Plan, they furnish to the British Empire means of obtaining real satisfaction.If the British Delegation, in answer to the appeal of the other Delegations, share these views, it would seem desirable that the technical experts attached to the Delegations concerned should value exactly the various allocations described in outline above. The sub-committees, the appointment of which was contemplated in the sitting of the Finance Commission on the f4th August, could thus be set up to examine the figures and to report to the Commission.APPENDIX II.(Most Secret.)Mr. Snowden to M. Jaspar.(Handed to Count de Griinne by Sir Maurice Hankey at midnight, August 16-17, 1929, at the Hotel Witte Brug, Scheveningen.)British Delegation, Grand Hotel, Dear M. Jaspar, Scheveningen-, August 16, 1929.MY colleagues and I have read with much disappointment the Memorandum that you sent me this morning. This Memorandum, so far from representing any advance towards meeting our point of view, merely repeats in a quite vague and: tentative manner suggestions which our Experts discussed informally some days ago, and which I then rejected as quite inadequate. I need not go into details in this letter, but they are set out in the Memorandum which I enclose herewith, and which I reserve the right to publish should circumstances at any time make it desirable to do so.[19849] - E 2
If the Conference is to arrive at the successful result which we all hope for, it is essential that the other creditor Governments should make a further and more serious effort to meet our position. We are claiming no unfair advantages; we are simply-asking that the rights to which we are entitled under existing agreements should be respected.  For this purpose means must be found (a) to restore to Great Britain (by means either of annual payments or an equivalent capital sum) the  2,400,000 a year which she loses under the distribution proposed by the Experts; or more precisely  2,000,000 a year, in addition to the adjustment required to provide debt cover in the current year; and(b) to assure to Great Britain a share approximating to, if not fully equivalentto, the British percentage of the unconditional annuities.The questions of deliveries in kind&quot;will, I hope, be found capable of arrange-ment, but it should be understood that we are not prepared to abandon the financial rights to which we are entitled in return for anv concessions on other points.Believe me,Yours sincerely, (Signed)       - PHILIP SNOWDEN.His Excellency M. H. Jaspar.Memorandum.1. The Note by the chiefs of the French, Italian, Japanese and Belgian Delega-tions remarks that the British Empire alone has raised objections to the Experts&apos; Plan. This is not the case as objections have been raised by a number of other Creditor Powers. But if it were the case, it would not be a matter for astonishment since the Plan proposes that Great Britain, and Great Britain alone, should receive a substantially smaller share of the first thirty-seven annuities than that to which she would be entitled under existing agreements. The Note does hot dispute this loss, but suggests that there is no possibility of remedying it since the work of the Experts represents a compromise which must be dealt with as a whole and cannot now be reopened. The British Government cannot admit this point of view. The Experts were independent experts whose recommendations in no way bound their Govern-ments. The Governments are free to accept, reject or amend these recommendations. The British Government assume that there can be no question as to the independence of the Experts. It was agreed upon by all the Governments before the appointment of the Committee, and it was emphasised on numerous occasions during the course of the Committee&apos;s meetings. For example, Mr. Churchill stated in the House of Commons on the 9th May that &quot; the conclusions &quot; of the Committee &quot; whatever they may be and whether agreed or not in no way commit His Majesty&apos;s Government which remains entirely free to review the whole position and to take their own decisions upon the work and recommendations of the Expert Committee.&quot; Similarly, the French Government in a note addressed to the British Ambassador in Paris on the 17th May, referred to the fact that the French Government had agreed to accept the principle of the independence of the Experts.2. The British Government do not, however, in fact seek to alter the fundamental points in the Experts&apos; proposal. As has already been announced, they are prepared to accept the Experts&apos; recommendations so far as concerns the payments to be made by Germany. This was pre-eminently the question on which the advice of independent experts was sought. The system of distribution of these payments between the Creditor Governments was already settled by existing agreements, which are binding upon the signatories. All that His Majesty,&apos;s Government desire is to bring the table of distribution in the Young Plan into conformity with these agree-ments by restoring to Great Britain the amounts, both of the total annuity and of the unconditional payments, of which she has been incomprehensibly and unjustifiably deprived for the benefit of Italy and France respectively.3. The Note from the other Creditor Powers seeks to prove that Great Britain has received very important advantages which should be set off against the admitted loss of 45 million R.M. (This figure should, according to the British calculation, be 48 million R.M.)His Majestv&apos;s Government are themselves in the best position to appreciate the advantages, such as they are, that the Plan would give them, and they are not prepared, for the reasons set out below, to agree that these advantages represent any adequate compensation for the sacrifices which they are asked to accept.
4. In the first place, the Note refers to the readjustment provided for in the Plan of the payments to the 31st August, 1929, so as to provide full debt cover to Great Britain during the current year. This readjustment will, according to the British calculation, entail an additional payment to Great Britain of considerably more than 100 million gold marks. But, in return, Great Britain is asked to renounce any further share of the payments during the period to the 31st March next. Under the existing distribution arrangements her share in these payments would be considerably more than the amount of the readjustment which she is to obtain under the terms of the Report. The value of this adjustment should, indeed, be brought into account, but there is no reason to calculate it at a higher rate than 5\ per cent, (the rate used by the Experts), and it can at best only.serve to reduce the deficiency of Great Britain from 48 million to 42 million g.m.5. Closing of Inter-Allied Accounts. A further alleged advantage to Great Britain, which is regarded as a set-off to the reduced share of the total annuities allotted to her, is the proposal in the Young Plan that the distribution shall not be affected by debits in respect of past transactions. This proposal benefits various Powers in different ways, and, as a result, Great Britain will be free from any liability to account to the other Creditor Powers for the surplus of the proceeds of liquidation of ex-German property. The amount of the surplus cannot as yet be ascertained, and in any case Great Britain would be entitled to retain 20 per cent, of it. But this surplus cannot be considered apart from all the other capital assets received or disposed of by other Powers. If there was any question of accounting strictly for this surplus, the British Government would have to insist on a complete account of the operations undertaken by the other Powers in regard to the liquidation not only of German, but of Austrian and Hungarian properties. The various degrees of strictness with which the Treaty provisions have been applied in the different countries and the discrepant views taken by the several Mixed Arbitral Tribunals would have to be examined. There is every reason to believe that, if this were done, Great Britain, so far from having any net liability, would be entitled to receive a substantial sum from the Pool. This would undoubtedly be the case if all capital assets were redistributed among the Creditor Governments from the beginning. There is, therefore, no justification for regarding this provision in the Plan as conferring any special benefit on Great Britain.6. Distribution of the Unconditional or Mobilisable Annuity. The Note of the other Creditor Powers then refers to the proposals in the Young Report as to the distribution of the unconditional annuities. On this point, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel&apos; bound to stress the inconsistency of the position taken up by the French Government. Before the appointment of the Experts&apos; Committee, it was agreed between the Head of the French Government and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer that France would not seek to obtain any special privilege or priority in regard to mobilisation. In the Note of the 30th October, the French Government confirmed this arrangement, and stated that : &quot; France seeks no fresh advantages.&quot; Yet the French Delegation now claim that France should receive no less than 500 million marks out of the 580 million marks of the mobilisable annuity available for distribution. Whatever may be the effect of the proposed Guarantee Fund, it is clear that, as regards mobilisation which was the particular point referred to in the French Government&apos;s assurances the French Delegation claim not only a special privilege or priority, but almost the whole of the mobilisable annuity. The British Government see no means of escaping from the conclusion that such a proposal cannot be reconciled with the specific assurances given to them by the French Government.7. The suggestion that Great Britain receives some compensation because her share of the first ten annuities is greater than it would be on the basis of existing agreements is not understood. On the basis of existing agreements, Great Britain would receive not only full debt cover, but a substantial surplus over and above debt cover during every year except the fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth years. There is a deficit in these years, but it would be more than covered by the accumulated surpluses which Great Britain would have already received during the earlier years; while, after the tenth year, Great Britain&apos;s surplus would soon amount to over  3 million a year. This would represent but a small contribution towards the arrears of  200 million which Great Britain is entitled to claim under the Balfour Note.The inadequacy of the case adduced in the present Note of the other Creditor Governments can best be seen by contrasting the position of Great Britain in this matter with that of Italy. It is suggested that the share of Great Britain in the German annuities should be limited to debt cover for the future, and that Great
Britain should renounce the small contribution towards arrears referred to above to which she would be entitled. Meanwhile, Italy&apos;s share in the German annuities is to be increased, not for the purpose of covering her debt liabilities, but in order to provide her with a surplus, over and above full debt cover, at the expense of Great Britain. Such a proposal is the more difficult to comprehend when it is remembered that the Italian Government claimed, and obtained, a settlement of their War Debt to Great Britain on unprecedently favourable terms on the plea that they were entitled to a comparatively small share of reparations and were prepared to apply their full receipts from that source to their inter-allied debt liabilities.It may be added that the calculations given by the French Delegation were based on the assumption that Great Britain should renounce her share of the allocation in respect of the Belgian debt which is precisely the proposal to which His Majesty&apos;s Government object.   These calculations are, therefore, wholly irrelevant.8. There is no foundation for the suggestion that Great Britain derives a special advantage which can be set off against the predominant shares of the unconditional annuity attributed to France, by reason of the fact that she obtains part of her share in the conditional annuity through the Reparation Recovery Act procedure. His Majesty&apos;s Government are entitled, under existing arrangements, to receive their share of deliveries in kind, in the form of the Reparation Recovery payments, and they have never had any intention of renouncing this right. It cannot, therefore, be regarded as a fresh concession that the Young Plan maintains the existing position in this respect.9. Deliveries in Kind. It is pointed out that the Report would effect a reduction in the amount of deliveries in kind from the present level of about 1,050 million marks to 540 million marks in the first year, and their abolition after ten years. The replacement of deliveries in kind by each transfer is in the interests of all the Creditor Powers, and not only of Great Britain. But the prospect of &quot;any such reduction is rendered illusory by the provision that during a postponement of transfer any part, or, indeed, the whole, of the postponable annuities, may be taken in deliveries in kind, and it appears that this arrangement might continue indefinitely after the ten years referred to. The position under the Young Plan is, in fact, far less favourable to British interests than the original Treaty provisions, which only stipulated for deliveries in kind till, at the latest, the 10th January, 1930.10. The British Government have thought it well to set out their point of view on the various arguments adduced in the Note of the other Creditor Governments. They can only respect that they are not prepared to accept the recommendations of the Plan without modification as regards the distribution of the total annuities, the distribution of the unconditional annuity and as regards deliveries in kind. As regards deliveries in kind, the Note of the other Creditor Governments makes no specific proposals to meet the desiderata of the British Government, and confines itself to vague and indefinite assurances that those Governments are ready to attempt to meet the British point of view. His Majesty&apos;s Government would require to know much more precisely what specific arrangements are proposed to safeguard British economic interests. But, in any case, they would not regard an arrangement about deliveries in kind (important though it is) as compensating them for the financial sacrifices they are asked to accept. On this latter aspect the Note of the other Creditor Governments is almost wholly unsatisfactory. The only proposal as regards the total annuity made is that Great Britain should receive &quot; a large part &quot; of the surplus available in the year 1929/30. It is not clear what the amount of this surplus will be, nor how other claims thereon are to be disposed of, so that it is clearly impossible to judge what this offer would amount to. But it seems clear that it could not, under any circumstances, exceed a capital sum of 200 million marks, equivalent to an annuity of 12-1 million marks. This offer amounts, therefore, at the highest possible computation to about one-quarter of the British sacrifice. This is an offer which the British Government cannot for a moment accept. During the whole course of these discussions, no reason has been given why the sacrifice to be made by Great Britain should be proportionately greater than that to be made by other Powers, and an offer to make good only one-quarter of the amount required cannot be regarded as a serious effort to meet the requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government.As regards the unconditional annuity, the only proposal made is that the major part of the small balance still available for distribution, after providing for the amounts set aside for France and Italy, should be allocated to Great Britain.   But
it is obvious that Great Britain is entitled to the larger share in this balance, and the complaint of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that, under the Plan, it is wholly inadequate to meet the claims of Great Britain and of the other Powers not yet provided for. The share of Great Britain alone should be approximately 120 million marks, while the amount offered is, on average, considerably less than one-half of this amount, and during the earliest years less than a quarter. On this point, again, His Majesty&apos;s Government must press for a reconsideration of the position, with a view to rinding a just and equitable settlement of those claims.APPENDIX III.(Confidential.) -(Translation.)Aide-memoire.(Handed by M. Jaspar to Mr. Henderson at 9 p.m. on Saturday, August 17.)PRESIDENT JASPAR has been required by his colleagues of the four delegations to make the following communication : His colleagues and himself have read with interest the letter and memorandum sent by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Without discussing here the terms-of the memorandum, to which, of course, the interested Powers would be able to answer in detail at given moment, M. Jaspar, in the name of the four delegations, would like to point out that Mr. Snowden seems to under-estimate the actual importance of the financial and economic concessions which were included in the memorandum which has been formerly handed to him.Therefore, as it was foreseen that there wTould be discrepancies in the apprecia-tion of the resulting figures, the aforesaid memorandum proposed that &quot; technicians &quot; attached to the interested delegations would meet in order to determine the value of the various allocations under consideration.As the letter and memorandum of Mr. Snowden do not answer the suggestion thus put forward, the representatives of the four Powers take the liberty of renewing it.They are convinced that this way of proceeding will be likely to clear up the position and bring the points of view nearer to each other.The Hague, August 17.

Their annual value of  1,430,000 should therefore be regarded as equivalent to an allocation to Great Britain of this amount of the uncon-ditional annuity.2. Free balance of  1,400,000 to be allocated to Great Britain.3.

The actual figure is as above, but there is some force in the argument at any rate as regards 1 and 2 above.This would require the consent of Germany, which has not yet been obtained, and it is very unlikely that the smaller Powers would accept so small a share as  500,000 a year. It is not our policy to obtain con-cessions at the cost of the small Powers rather than France and Italy.This is therefore a very hypothetical figure; anyhow, the Spa share of Great Britain would be at least  6 millions a year.(0.) Deliveries in Kind.1. Re-exports to be prohibited.2. France has made a proposal to control deliveries during a moratorium. The other Powers thought that Italy would be prepared to accept this and to discuss further the question of coal.1. This is good so far as it goes, but it is the smallest of our points under this head:2. Italy has so far refused to accept the proposal about deliveries during a moratorium and has made no adequate proposition about coal.O
