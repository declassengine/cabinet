I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,&quot;)&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1929.SECRET.CP. 230 (29).CABINET.Legislation proposed by the Government of Bombay to control picketing and intimidation in Trade Disputes.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.1. I wish to inform my colleagues of, and to consult them at an early date in regard to, certain legislation which the Government of Bombay have proposed, with the concurrence of the Government of India, to introduce at once, as-measures of urgency, for the purpose of more effectively preventing or suppressing-the disorder and rioting which still, after many months, are liable to break out in direct or indirect connection with the long standing trade dispute in the Cotton Mill Industry.2. I do not propose to go deeply now into the complex question of the condition of the Bombay Cotton Industry. Suffice it to say that the industry has been for a. long while in a depressed state and that the Report of the Tariff Board Enquiry in-1927 disclosed a total loss over the four years 1923-6 of some Rs. 8i- crores-( 3f millions). The Board made certain suggestions as to more efficient methods, better distribution of labour, reductions in cost of production including cuts in wages, &amp;c.The various groups of millowners proceeded to take action in accordance with some or other of these suggestions, or to justify on the basis of the BoarcUs recom-mendations, action already taken, in regard to which operatives had already struck work for greater or less periods.Sporadic strikes continued to occur until in April 1928 they coalesced into a general strike, which was launched, without warning and was accompanied by much violence.3. Immediately prior to the &quot; General Strike &quot; in April 192S there were five-Textile Workers&apos; Unions in Bombay, viz : (1) the Bombay Textile Labour Union, registered under the Indian Trades Union Act, under the presidency of Mr. N. M. Joshi, with a membership of between 8,000 and 9,000; (2) the Girni Kamgar (Mill Workers) Mahamanclal of Prabhadevi, with a membership of 1,270 ; (3) and (4) the Girni Kamgar Mandals of Ghorupodo and Chinchpokli, with a joint membership of 800-900; and (5) the Bombay Mill Workers&apos; Union, formed in March 1928, with a. membership of 300, by Mr. S. 1:1. Jhabvala in opposition to the Bombay Textile-Labour Union under Mr. Joshi.In addition there had recently come into being the Workers&apos; and Peasants Party,, an extreme left-wing organisation, with definitely communist aims and associations. The leaders of the Bombay branch joined hands with the recently formed -Bombay Mill AVorkers&apos; Union and prevailed on the Prabhadevi Manual to join them in bringing about a general mill strike. (It is understood to be this association of Unions, several of the leaders of which are among the prisoners charged in the Communist Conspiracy Trial at Meerut, that is now popularly known as the Girni Kamgar Union and has taken the sobriquet of &quot;Reg 1&apos;lag Union.&quot;) A Strike-Corn mittee was formed of the leaders of these Unions.A Strike Committee was also formed by the Textile Labour Union (Mr. Joshi&apos;s) to-enquire into and formulate the grievances of the workers. For some time the two Committees, having divergent aims, held apart, but eventually a compromise was-reached and a Joint Strike Committee formed.On 3rd. May 1928 the Joint Strike Committee formulated a list of the men&apos;s-grievances, which has come to be known as the &quot; Seventeen Demands,&quot; including-several put forward in the,course Of isolated: strikes prior to the general strike. On. 12th May the owners published a statement of the terms on which they would reopen their mills.3S0S757.29A
4. The genera] strike continued with greater or less intensity, despite attempts by the Governor and Members-of his Council in April and May to effect a settlement. Meetings were held iu June 1928 between the Millownors&apos; Association and the Joint Strike Committee, but no settlement was reached. Eventually, after a further abortive conference in August under the chairmanship of the General Member of the Governors Council, a settlement was reached in October last on the basis of the appointment by Government of a Committee of Enquiry under the Chairmanship of Sir Charles Fawcett, a judge of the High Court, and the general strike was called off.The terms of reference to the Fawcett Committee were to consider (a) Whether the amended scheme of a standardised schedule of rates and of a standardised muster prepared by the Millowners&apos; Association, and also the scheme prepared by the Strike Committee is fair and reasonable.(b). Whether the Seventeen Demands advanced by the Strike Committee are fair and reasonable, and to what extent, if any, they should be met.(c) Whether the standing orders for operatives as amended and presented by the Millowners&apos; Association on the 4th October 1928 are fair and reasonable.The Committee presented its report in March 1029 a document of 170 printed pages exclusive of appendices. The general result of the Committee&apos;s enquiry was to find the Millowners&apos; Association^ proposals (a) for standardisation of wages, duties and numbers of operatives, (b) for standing orders about conditions of employment, in the main fair and reasonable. It found that of the Seventeen Demands, ten had already been granted, two were reasonable, two were not, and three were partly fair.The Standardisation Scheme (which was put forward as subject to revision in the light of experience) included proposals for machinery, by mediation rules agreed to &quot;by both sides, for setting up Joint Committees to enquire into disputes arising under the scheme ; it included also an &quot; Efficiency System &quot; which aimed at reducing the number of operatives employed while raising their wages and providing conditions favourable for the extra efhciencj&apos; demanded. All these proposals the Committee found fair and reasonable ; they found also that there was justification for the owners&apos; proposal to make a 1\ per cent, cut in weavers&apos; wages, but they recommended that this pro-posal should be dropped in existing circumstances provided the labour leaders undertook to co-operate in working the Standardisation Scheme.5. During the progress of the Fawcett Committee&apos;s enquiry, though the general strike had been called off, isolated strikes in various groups of mills continued to take place as a result largely of the activities of the associations of unions known as the Red Flag Union, which was closely associated with and may be said to be dominated by the Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Party. As a result there was a permanent sense of tension, marked by occasional outburst of violence, among all branches of labour in Bombay. In February last certain &quot; Pathans&quot; (i.e. Northern India Moslems) who were employed as workmen at an oil works in a Bombay suburb, where a minor trade dispute was iu progress, were murderously attacked. Their companions retaliated, and the resulting outburst developed with intense rapidity into the severest kind of communal rioting, lasting over a period of several days. Drastic police and magisterial action was taken, but two battalions of British troojjs had to be brought into the Presidency area before the rioting was put down ; order was not established till the casualty list had reached a total of over 140 killed and over 700 injured. A further outburst of rioting with a heavy, but not so heavy a death roll (as the police authorities who had been taken quite by surprise in February were now on their guard) occurred in April.0. In April a new general strike in the mills began. Its origin is traceable to a series of dismissals in the Wadia group which the- owners stated to be purely disciplinaiy and the Girni Kanigar Union interpreted as part of a policy of victimisation. The Union called out the workers aud the owners, after a period of closure, reopened the mills with a staff including 6,500 new hands.On 24th April a joint meeting of the Strike Committee and the Millowners was held to consider the Fawcett recommendations ; and the G irni Kamgar Union demanded that the dispute in the Wadia mills be enquired into. The owners refused an enquiry by the Joint Committee, and an alternative was suggested by the Bombay Textile Union for a Sub-Committee to hold the euqniry. The owners were prepared to consider this if the Girni Kamgar Union would agree ; but the latter demanded reinstatement of all old hands in the Wadio group as a prior condition ; this the owners refused. The Girni Kamgar Union then called a general mill strike for noon on 26th April.
Over 100,000 workers came ovtt in three days and though the numbers out have fluctuated considerably there are only 70,000 odd now working as against 110,000 on .21th April.^       ..      &apos;       ^ &apos; . *The strike is accompanied by occasional outbursts of violence and by intimidation amounting to terrorism and resulting in street fighting which tends always to develop intercom nmual clashes between Hindus and Moslems. Only in the last few days street fighting has occurred which could not be stopped till the police fired.  .7. Ou 19th June the Governor held a conference with most if not all of the public bodies of Bombay, including the Bombay Corporation, Banking Association, Indian, and European Chambers of Commerce, and the Servants of India Society, but -excluding the Millowuers&apos; Association and the Mill Workers Unions. At its termination he announced that the Bombay Government proposed (I) To appoint a Court of Enquiry under the recently enacted Trades Disputes Act. Such a court would consist of one or more independent persons with no function but to enquire into the matters referred to it and report to the Government.(2) To move the Governor-General to promulgate an Ordinance making &quot;cognisable&quot; the offence of criminal intimidation, pending the passage of legislation to the same effect.(3) To introduce in the Bombay Legislature a Bill to control picketing on the lines of the British Trades Disputes and Trades Union Act, 1927.Lord Trwin discussed the matter in Bombay with Sir F. Sykes and Lord Goschen before leaving for England, and it was decided that it would be preferable that the further powers sought in regard to criminal intimidation should be taken by ordinary legislation rather than by Ordinance ; the proposal to proceed by Ordinance has therefore been dropped.8. Legislation of this kind in a Provincial Council requires the prior approval of the Governor-General, and on 1st July I telegraphed requesting to be informed of the texts of the Bills in regard to criminal intimidation and picketing before introduction was sanctioned.On 1.1th July the Government of India telegraphed that they proposed to move the Governor-General to sanction the introduction of the &quot;Bombay Prevention of Intimidation &quot; Bill. On the 12th they telegraphed similarly in respect of the Picketing Bill ; and on the 13th that, at their suggestion, the Government of Bombay proposed :also to introduce a Bill for the Safeguarding of Life and Property on the lines of the Bengal Presidency Area Emergency Security Act, 1920.9. The Criminal Intimidation Bill has for its purpose to make &quot;cognisable&quot; the -offence of criminal intimidation (as defined in section 503 Indian Penal Code; ichen committed in, connection with a trade dispute. The preamble and statement of reasons -a&apos;lso.make it clear that the intimidation to be prevented is only that which is perpetrated in connection with trade disputes. I should explain that a &quot; cognisable &quot; offence is one the prosecution of which may be initiated, the offender arrested and the witnesses produced by the police without an order from a magistrate, while the complainant in a &quot;non-cognisable&quot; case must apply in the first instance to a magistrate for process against the alleged offender and for the production of the witnesses whose names lie must furnish. The offence of criminal intimidation being at present non-cognisable, the police are powerless to deal with persons guilty ef it, even though the offence may be committed in their presence; and in the condition of affairs of late prevailing in Bombay City few persons who have been criminally intimidated would venture to incur further risks of molestation by appearing- in Court and applying for process -against his intimidators.I cannot contest the strong evidence that criminal intimidation has been and is -widely practised in connection with the cotton industry and other trade disputes, and I cannot oppose the strong view of the local government, of Lord Irwin and others whom I have consulted that, in the state of terrorism that has prevailed in Bombay in the past year or more it is necessary to give the police and magistrates more drastic powers to deal with, the offence. But I consider it undesirable to limit the offence to -connection with trade disputes, and preferable to proceed against criminal intimidation, in whatever circumstances it may be practised, where the Governor is prepared to notify that, for whatever cause, a state of emergency exists.
10. The Picketing Bill follows fairly closely the picketing provisions of the British Act of 1927, but the penalty prescribed is more severe, being &quot; imprisonment for a term which may extend to a year,&quot; or fine of up to Rs. 500 ( 37 10s.) or both, as-against three months or  20. The text of the operative clause is- printed as Appendix I. It is to apply only in the Presidency area (i.e. the City of Bombay and immediate vicinity), to. have: validity Tor five years only and to be brought into effect only when the Governor notifies that it is necessary to do so ; nevertheless I feel that &quot;* in view of our declared intention to repeal the corresponding sections of the British Act, it is impossible for me, without my colleagues&apos; prior consent, to authorise the introduction of this measure by the Bombay Government. If the general feeling in Bombay as to the necessity of this Bill is so strong that unofficial members would be found-ready to introduce it, and the Council as a whole ready to pass it, then I think that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not intervene, and for this reason I sent, a private telegram (Appendix II) to the Viceroy and repeated it to the Governor of Bombay. I gather from the replies -received that the latter expects that public opinion in the Council will so strongly favour legislation of this kind that a private member will give notice of a Bill on the lines proposed if the Government do not themselves promote it, but that the Government of India see difficulties in such legislation beingTeft to a private meinber&apos;s initiative. What precisely is the nature of the difficulties they foresee lam ascertaining and will inform my colleagues orally. My colleagues will of course realise the fierce criticism which under present-day conditions always attaches to interference by the Secretary of State, particularly when, as in this case, no action is required of him by statute, and it is only by the exercise of his general powers of superintendence that he can intervene at all ; and they will also, realise that no attempts to conceal the fact that this legislation is not being proceeded with owing to intervention from here wall succeed.11. The Bill&apos; for the Safeguarding of Life and Property presents difficulties of a rather different nature. In 1923, after the City of Calcutta had undergone a regular campaign of robbery with violence, the Bengal Legislative Council passed readily a Bill (known as the &quot; Goondas Bill &quot;) giving power to the Local Government, on the recommendation of the Commissioner of Police in Calcutta or of the District Magistrate, to issue a warrant to deport from the Province (or from Calcutta if the offenders were really Bengalis) the roughs and hooligans or &quot;goondas &quot; mostly from up-country by whom the outrages were committed. The warrant was to be executed only after scrutiny of the case by two judges. In 1920, after Calcutta had passed through a serious of bloody riots principally communal in origin somewhat similar to those experienced this year by Bombay, the powers taken in ] 923 were found to be insufficient, and a more drastic Bill was framed. It was aimed at the same class of individual, roughs and hooligans, some of them practically professional assassins and hired bravoes wdio are drawn towards, or sometimes actually invited, to places where violent disturbances especially those of communal origin are in progress or are contemplated. The Bengal Act of 1926 gives power, in a state of emergency duly notified in the Gazette, to the Commissioner of Police in Calcutta or the District Magistrate to issue an order of deportation from the Province and execute it forthwith, subject only to general control by the Local Government and to the right of appeal of the individual affected to the Local Government. The Bengal Act was passed by the Legislative Council ; there was heated debate, but the Swarajist opposition abstained from voting against the Bill. The Bill now proposed in Bombay is mutatis mutandis the same as the Bengal Security Act of 1920, and would apply in the &quot; Presidency area &quot; only.The Government of India are strongly of opinion that the Bombay Government should be in possession of the powers this Bill would give, even though at the-present time no &quot; state of emergency&quot; actually exists demanding their exercise, and I may mention that the Bengal Act has only been put into force for two limited periods since it was enacted. I understand that in fact during the riots this year the Government of Bombay used, erroneously, the powers given by the Foreigners Act to effect the object at which the present Bill aims. This indicates that the necessity has occurred, and may recur, to use such drastic powers.Here again in view of our ultimate responsibility for the preservation of law and order in Bombay, I cannot recommend refusal of permission to test the opinion of the local legislature by the introduction of a Bill of the land proposed, though in the abstract its provisions may be open to criticism ; more especially as I am assured that
if the Council were to reject the Bill, the Governor will raise no question of nsing his powers of certification to override their decision.12. I am in private correspondence with Lord Goschen and Sir F. Sykes as to the Picketing Bill, and the procedure to be adopted in regard to it; it is a matter of urgency to decide whether in the circumstances disclosed in this note 1 should inform them officially that I do not object to their proceeding with the other two, provided they, agree (as I understand they do) that the Criminal Intimidation Bill has no specific reference to trade disputes.India Office, VV. B.22nd July 1929.APPENDIX I.&quot;Whoever in contemplation or in furtherance of any trade dispute, by himself or with others, with a view to inducing any workman to abstain from working or not to accept employment, follows such workman from place to place, or for either of such purposes or for the purpose of obtaining or communicating information, by himself or with others, attends at or near a house or place where any workman resides or is employed or seeks to be employed and there conducts himself in such a manner as is calculated to cause alarm to any person in that house or place, or to obstruct approach thereto or egress therefrom or to lead to a breach of the peace, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to Rs. 500 or with both.&quot;APPENDIX II.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, 20th July 1929. (Repeated to Governor of Bombay.)Private and personal. My private and personaf telegram dated 19th July. Proposed Picketing Bill. Apart from my doubts as to the merits of such legislation, my difficulty is this. The Government here has given notice of its intention to amend the Trades Disputes Act, 1927, and is now asked by the Government of India to approve the enactment iu Bombay for the first time-of the picketing clauses of this Act. I should be obliged therefore to lay the matter, if pursued as a Government measure, before my colleagues in the Cabinet, where I feel sure there would be the greatest opposition to the course proposed. If unofficiaL opinion in the Bombay Legislative Council is really strong as to the necessity of the proposed picketing Bill, I presume that some private member would be found ready to introduce it.I approve the fullest use of existing powers for the purpose of preventing disorder and intimidation as leading up to disorder, and, further, as regards the Criminal Intimidation Bill, provided the Legislative Council is willing to make criminal intimidation of every kind cognisable in time of emergency, I am prepared to accept their view, on the understanding that it is made cognisable in a state of emergency of any kind, and that there is no specific reference to trade disputes.As regards the Bill to safeguard life and property, would you be prepared to accept the decision of the Bombay Legislative Council as to its necessity, or, if it is rejected in the Council, do you suggest that it should be certified?I attach the greatest importance to public action to show that the workers, as represented by their legitimate unions, e.g. Joshi&apos;s union, have an opportunity of bringing forward their grievances. I have seen a good deal about alleged withholding of wages due. Would it be possible to permit both the millowners and the workers to be represented at the Trades Dispute enquiry with a view to cross-examining witnesses and bringing forward evidence of their own. Such a positive approach to the problem seems to me most important.3808B
