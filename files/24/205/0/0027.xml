IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CRET. COPY NO. P) J&quot; ._P. 227(29).CABINET.ROYAL COMMISSION ON LONDON SQUARES; REPORT.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.This Royal Commission was appointed in August, 1927, &quot;to Inquire and report on the squares and similar open spaces existing in the area of the Administrative County of London with special reference&apos; to the conditions on which they are held and used and the desirability of their preservation as open spaces and to recommend whether any or all of them should be permanently safeguarded against any use detrimental to their character as open spaces and if so, by what means and on what terms and conditions.&quot;The Commission was comprised of 14 members, and included the Marquis of Londonderry (Chairman), Dame Caroline Bridgeman, Sir Howard Frank, three London Members of Parliament (including Mr. H. Snell), representatives of the London County Council and of the Metropolitan Borough Councils Standing Joint Committee (including the Rev. A.G. Pritchard, a Labour Councillor of Battersea) and the Treasury Solicitor,The Commission reported on the 11th September, 1928, and the principal recommendations were to the effect -(1)   That the squares and similar open spaces (with five exceptions where appropriation to other purposes was already authorised under statutory enactment) should be reserved as permanent open spaces and that buildings other than buildings ancillary to use as open spaces should be prohibited.In the main, owners were agreed, that subject to reasonable safeguards preservation was desirable.
&apos; CS)   That tho Local Authorities concerned should not bo.,given any general powers of compulsoriiy acquiring the squares as public open spaces ( save in special cases of neglect), and that the inheritance of the squares and any rights or interests therein should not be altered;(3)    That the reservation of tho squares should not operate to prevent the carrying out of necessary road wldenings, or the use of the subsoil for purposes (e.g. underground garages) which would not interfsrs with the surface;(4)    That compensation should not be payable in the case of -(a) The 63 squares which are subject to special acts of Parliament relating to their maintenance and management.thes special Acts provide, in effect, for an arrangement, without limit of time, whereby the cost of upkeep of the square is m8t by a rate on the surrounding Inhabitants. The danger in such cases is that one person should become the owner in possession of the square and surrounding houses and sell off the houses under contract&quot;&quot; that tha purchasers should not exercise their rights under the special Act, or that the owner and inhabitants of the houses should Contract to a similar effect.    The Commission considered that the possibility of such an arrangement could not reasonably be held to warrant a right to compensation.(b) The 53 squares which are vested jointly in thefreeholders of adjoining houses or are subject to restrictive covenants against the building.In these cases^ the owner at some time or other has granted rights of user of the squares as open spaces in porpatviity and no hardship arises if compensation Is excluded.(5)    That compensation (to be determined by arbitration inthe event of dispute) should be payable by the LondonCounty Council (with contributions from the metropolitan borough Councils) in the case of the 223 squares in
private ownership which are subjoot only to such leases,or rights under leases of surrounding property, as mayhave been granted.In these cases, the Commission could find no justification for excluding compensation.     There was no implied undertaking by owners when they laid out their estates that the open spaces would continue after the expiration of the leases and they are therefore free to build when the leases expire.The Commission were unable to agree that the Metropolitan Commons Act, 1866, which in effect prevented building on metropolitan common lands without compensation, or the London Building Act, 1894, which prohibited building in front of the general building line already fixed by existing buildings in a street, dould bo regarded as analogous to a provision prohibiting building on these squares and as a precedent for excluding compensation.The Commission were confidentially advised by the valuation Office of the Board of Inland Revenue thatthe compensation payable should not exceed  600,000(6)   That betterment (the increase in value of any property due to the permanent reservation of the square as an open space) should be recoverable by the London County Council %(7)   That the suggested legislation should not become operative as regards the squares subject to compensa-tion until an Order had been made by the London County Council and that the London County Council should have power to withdraw or modify the Order If the compensation awarded were considered to be incommensurate with the advantage of preserving a square.     In effect, this would enable the London County Council to consider each case on Its merits.
The report was signed by all the members,subject to reservations by Sir Howard Prank, whooonsidered that compensation should be payable whereverit could be shown that the owner had a legal right tobuild, and by the Labour representatives, the rev. A. G. Pritohard and Mr. Snell, faho were against thepayment of any compensation.The late Minister of Health informed theLondon County Council in March last that they could proceed on the assumption that legislation dealing withthe squares would pnpbabiy be introduced in the nextPar^a^ent, if&apos; the Conservative Government were returnedto power.     The Council have recently passed a resolutionurging on the present Government the need of immediate legislation on the subject and offering to render any assistance in their power in connection with thelegislation.,Ear^p legislation is unquestionably desirableon this subject and I shall bo glad to have authorityto take measures for the introduction of a Bill.     Theonly issue which arises is whether any provision shouldbe made for compensation and this is a matter on which cabinet decision seems desirable.Mr. Pritohard and Mr. Snell in theirreservation stated -&quot;It appears to us that the provisions of the London. Building Act as to general building, lines,, and more especially the provisions of the Metropolitan Commons Act;, 1866,, do^ in effect., provide for sterilisation -a mo-liltenanco of the stavas quo - without compensation, and that tSssre is no reason why these enactments should nol* be -regarded as providing a precedent for the non-admission of the claim for compensation in regard to the
sterilisation, or the maintenance of the status quo, ofthe existing squares and enclosures.Our conclusions on this matter are strengthened by the consideration that, if the claim for compensation be allowed, not only will the danger to the preservation of the &quot;squares be Increased, but owners will be tempted to involve the Local Authority in lengthy and expensive arbitration proceedings, especially in view of the complicated question of &quot;betterment&quot; that would doubtless arise.     The admission of the claim for compensation might actually endanger the existence of the squares at a time when public authorities feel unable to Increase their financial commitments.We are unable to see that the maintenance of the status quo would inflict Injury upon, or reduce the value of the property of, the owners of the squares?...,.&quot;It will no doubt be argued by oppon6Uts -(1) as regards the London Building Act, that the effoctof the provision as to building lines is to prevent a person from bringing a building beyond theexisting line of the street, except with the consentof the County Council, and that these provisions wouldnot operate so as to prevent building on the squareitself if the owner got into his own hands all therights appertaining to the square; and(2) as regards the Commons Act of 1866, that this Actapplied to commons over which there were immemorialrights, that there are no similar rights for thesquares, and that, therefore, the two cases are noton all fours.It seems doubtful whether the Commons would belikely to pa ss a Bill which did not carry out therecommendations of the majority of the Commission and almost certain that the Lords would not do so.The case against compensation is more fullystated in the letter from the Minister of Transport ofwhich a copy is appended.
As the Bill will deal with the findings of a Royal Commission it will accord with practice for the Government to introduce it although it will relate only to London matters.The Bill will affect private interests, and would he treated as a hybrid Bill.     This will involve the same procedure as a private Bill, including notices to owners, which must be served in the Autumn if a Bill is introduced next Session.     An early decision is therefore desirable on the question whether legislation is to be Introduced next Session.A. G.22nd July, 1929.

House of Commons.20th July, 1929.My dear Greenwood:* London Squares and Enclosures.Referring to our discussion of July 19, in accordance with your request, I submit my views with regard to the policy which should be adopted in connection with the preservation of London Squares and Enclosures.     The attitude of the London County Council on the matter has been one of shameful evasion covering a period. I believe, of seven years, and during the whole of this period it has either been filling up time by &quot;enquiry&quot; itself or encouraging the Government to enquire by means of the Royal Commission, without at any time placing on record its views on the means by which the-Squares should be preserved.Epr your information I append to this letter the material portions of the Evidence I gave to the Royal Commission on London Squares.     This Evidence was given on the unanimous instruction of the Executive Committee of the London Labour Party and the line taken was unanimously approved by the Labour Party on the London County Council. I am confident that it would also be approved by the present London Members of Parliament.The note of   reservation appended to the Report of the Royal Commission by Mr. Harry Snell, M.P., and the Rev. A.G. Prichard, L.CC, also indicated the views of the London Labour Movement and I am confident that a proposal by the Government to include general provisions for compensation would be disapproved by the London Labour Party and the London Members of Parliament, although, no doubt, absence of provisions for compensation would be opposed by the Conservative Party.     It would appear, therefore, that the Government has to choose between meeting the criticism of the Conservatives or of the Labour Party, my own view being that facing the former is the best alternative.I submit that the following are strong reasons against compensation:-(a) That many owners have voluntarily allowed their Squares to be prohibited by statute against the builder and that certain others are willing to follow a similar course.     It would be unfair to take what is given by the decent owners and to compensate the Belfish.(b) The Squares have been unbuilt upon for a long period so that the public have rights.(c) The preservation of the Squares has no doubt secured some revenue to Estate owners in connection with the rents paid by the tenants or owners of the resident property surrounding the Squares.1.
(d)   fn addition to the statutes mentioned by Mr. Snell and Mr. priohard in their note to the Royal Commission&apos;s Report, there is an enormous amount of interferenoe with the rights of estate developers and owners under the Town planning acts, both as to the prohibition of building and the restrictions as to number, height and character of the buildings to be erected.(o)     It is not proposed that the Squares should be thrown open to the public out merely that they should bs sterilised in relation to building as preserving the amenities of the district together with the rights of the surrounding residents.(f)   If compensation is conceded the practicability of even a Labour London County Council preserving all the important London Squares would be a matter of the gravest doubt.Public opinion in London very strongly favours the preservation of the Squares.     The matter is one of considerable urgency owing to the possibility of the Squares being built on at any time.    Each time a Square is built on there is a public outcry.     X think the wisest course of the Government would be that incorporated In, paragraphs 11 and 12 of the attached Evidence which I gsire before the Royal Commission,Yours sincerely,(Sgd)   HERBERT MORRISON.Rt. Ron, Arthur Greenwood, M.P., Minister of Health.
EXTRACTS PROM Evidence to the Royal Commission on London Squares by Herbert Morrison on behalf of the London Labour Party.* * *M 4.       It is understood that history and facts related to the subject matter of the Royal Commission&apos;s Inquiry will be provided by the Commission&apos;s technioal advisers and by the London County Council.5.       The garden squares of London constitute a good feature of the best of planning in London as it extended beyond the old City walls immediately following the Great Fire. Apart from the instances of definite planning on building estates, where garden squares are generally to be found,  the growth of London has been otherwise without system and accidental.     It is only within the last few years that the provisions of the Town Planning Acts have been put into operation within the County of London, and this., generally speaking, enly applies to the un-built on portions of the County.     The result is that the garden scares, as we know them to-day, constitute pleasant examples of a guided development of the Metropolis.6.       The advantages of the preservation of the garden squares are twofold.     In the first place they are a decided amenity to the houses immediately overlooking them and, if one may judge, the absence of appreciable garden spaces in the rear may be taken to be an economical method of providing that space in the gardens over which the houses look.In the second place they are an asset of amenity to the district and, by preservation,  these open spaces add to the health of the inhabitants of a wider area than that of the houses immediately overlooking.7.       Various courses present themselves as a possible means of preserving the status quo of the garden squares.   In the first instance it is the preservation of the present unbuilt-on condition that is important.     It is not desirable, in this connection,  that any question of the throwing .open of these spaces to the public should be permitted to complicate the major issue.     Owing to the surroundings, and from their general situation, it is not as playgrounds that they have proven their value, and it is suggested that it is not desirable as part of the present Inquiry to embark upon a scheme for freeing them to the public,  inviting as this would the certainty of opposition by the inhabitants of the houses around.8.     One course open, which has been the one so far adopted in preserving threatened squares for the use of the public, has been their purchase.     Generally speaking,  the purchase price has been on the basis of considering the site of the enclosure as an unbuilt site, freed from any statutory or other obligations, providing it is used for that purpose.9.     In investigating the circumstances of these purchases, it rather seems to have been assumed that there were no rights ef the public in the preservation of the squares. It is obvious that on pure financial grounds such a course cannot be widely^resorted to with regard to garden enclosures.1.
10.     The second course, which is one that appears to the Londen Labour Party, in view of the circumstances, as an appropriate one, as it would recognise the rights of ownership in the present owners, and, at the same time, give effect to the  inehoate rights which the public have, by the passing of years, obtained in the preservation of a definite piece of original planning, is that there should be a statutory prohibition against the change of the present status of the garden enclosures.     This was the basis of a Bill introduced in Parliament during the past Session but which made no further progress.11.     There seems to be every reason, on the grounds of pulic policy, for the adoption of such a course by Parliament. It leaves the ownership in existing hands and preservos for the owners of the land immediately around the amenity which they themselves provided in the original lay-out,-at the same time it gives a recognition to the fact which is coincident with the whole course of legislation with regard to property in cities, that an amenity which the public have long been accustomed to should not be withdrawn by subsequent action.129     Any such policy would necessarily carry with it the power enabling the owners,  on re-development of their estates,  to alter the position of a garden enclosure, provided always that on the re-lay-out at least as large an amenity should be provided in lieu of that which might be incorporated in a building site;    it is suggested that arrangements of this kind, howeverc should be subject to the approval of the London County Council.
