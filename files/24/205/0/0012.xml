MOST SECRET, j COPY NO^CP.212(29).--- CABINET.Proposals for a Subway under Piccadilly connecting Berkeley Square and the Mall. Memorandum by the Minister of Transport. The question of providing some means whereby traffic could pass between Berkely Street and the Mall or Pall Mall, without interfering with the traffic passing east and west along Piccadilly, has been under consideration for many years.     A scheme for the construction of a sunken roadway and short tunnel connecting Berkeley Street and the Mall, with short cross streets leading into Jermyn Street and Pall Mall, was recommended by the Advisory Board of Engineers (consisting of Sir John Wolfe-Barry, Sir Benjamin Baker and Mr. 17.B.  Parsons) appointed in 1904 by the Royal Commission on London Traffic.     This recommendation was endorsed by the Technical Sub-Committee appointed in 1919 by the Committee on London Traffic under the Chairmanship of Mr. Kennedy-Jones, M. P.-   - . - - - ....... . .-The London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee reviewed the scheme early in 1925 when Devonshire House was under demolition and recommended that immediate steps should be taken to preserve the line of the proposed Subway by arranging with the promoters of the new building to be erected on the site for certain alterations to the foundations of the new building at a cost of  35,000.     The necessary financial arrangements to give effect to the foregoing recommendation could not be made in the short time available and the Committee subsequently recommended a modified scheme involving the construction of a Subway under Stratton Street (to the west of the Devonshire House site) andTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITTANIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT.
Piccadilly so as to&quot; connect Berkeley Square with the Mall (via the Green Park) and that,  as the various buildings and other properties on the proposed line of the Subway were cleared for development, the necessary easements should be secured so as to enable the Subway to be constructed.Up to date, approximately  20,000 has been paid out of the Eoed Fund for easements along certain sections of the line.     Kecentl^r Lansdowne House and grounds have been put in the market for development and this has afforded an opportunity of acquiring the requisite easement for another substantial section of the subway at a cost of  57,000.    The Chief Valuer to the Board of Inland Revenue has advised that this sum is well within the figure which he would be prepared to recommend as reasonable.      If this easement is secured, the only remaining physical obstacles to the construction of the tunnel ?/ould be a block of flats at the top of Stratton Street  and certain cellars belonging to some old house property on the western side of that street.      It is estimated that the -removal of these further obstacles in the immediate future would Involve additional expenditure of about  200,000 and it has been deemed to be advisable to wait until these properties come Into the market with a view to demolition and erection of new buildings in the expectation that the necessary easements for the Subway could then be secured on more favourable terms.The scheme recommended by the London Traffic advise^ Committee consists of a sunken roadway commencing on the western side of Berkeley Square leading to a short tunnel commencing at Lansdowne House gounds, passing under Stratton Street and Piccadilly and emerging In the existing pathway along the eastern edge of Green Park to the Mall, known as Queens Walk.      The total length of the new carriageway would be 1,120 yards of which about
350 yards would be&quot; in tunnel with a headroom of 16 feet.     The carriageway would accommodate two lines of traffic (one north and one south).     The traffic using the Subway would necessarily be restricted to light vehicles, such as motor-cars and taxi-cabs so long as a similar restriction obtains in regard to traffic using the Mall,The cost of ths Constructional works is estimated at about    225,000 which together with the cost of the necessary casements,  on the assumption that these were to be secured now, would bring the total cost&apos;of the Subway to a sum in the neighbourhood of  500,000.A census of the traffic which by using the Subway -would be enabled to avoid crossing Piccadilly on the level makes it clear that the subway would afford considerable relief of the existing congestion of traffic in that part of Piccadilly bet-Teen Old Bond Street and Berkeley Street and would provide an Important new route for traffic between Mayfair and the districts north and -west thereof and Victoria or Charing Cross.     With the increasing number of vehicles using Piccadilly and the adjoining thoroughfares, some such scheme may become essential in the not distant future.The London County Council and the Westminster City Council, who are concerned as the Improvement and Highway Authorities, respectively, have been kept informed of the scheme and of the action already taken in securing easements, but they have not so far been asked to adopt the scheme or to become responsible for its execution.The interference with the Green Park, although confined to its eastern edge, will doubtless excite much opposition on the part of the residents in the very valuable private houses on the east side of Queens Walk whose amenities
may be affected.   . The freehold of nearly all these houses is believed to be vested in the Commissioner&apos; of Crown Lands. Some objection ma?/ also be raised to a slight but necessary intarference with the south-western corner of the gardens in Berkeley Square.     There is in addition some risk that the proposed use of the Park may lead to a public agitation against the scheme.It must, however, be borne in mind that if the present opportunity of securing the easement through the Lansdowne House property is lost, it may only be possible to obtain the necessary easement for the construction of the subway at a much greater cost.     Expensive buildings are likely to be erected on the site at an early date and once the erection is begun the compensation payable might well reach prohibitive dimensions. If the scheme is now abandoned, the  20,000 already paid for easements will have been wasted.      At the same time,  a further expenditure of such a substantial sum as  57,000 should not be Incurred unless there is a reasonable probability that the scheme will be carried out at no very distant date.The present owner of the Lansdowne House property, who has purchased It with a view to resale for building operation, is pressing for an immediate decision and it Is obvious that he cannot be expected to hold his offer open for more than a few days.      This renders it impossible to obtain the formal concurrence of the London County Council or of 7Jestmlnster City Council to the scheme before deciding whether or not the additional expenditure of  57,000 is to be incurred.In the circumstances, I should be glad to have a decision from my colleagues whether they approve the scheme, in principle,  in spite of the interference with the Park, and whether the proposed further expenditure of  57,000 (estimated)
for the easement through the Lansdowne House property may be incurred.     If so, I should propose to invite the active co-operation of the London County Council and the &quot;Westminster City Council in the eventual execution of the scheme and in now tailing all further steps ;rliich may be reasonably necessary to secure that the line of the sub;/ay is preserved throughout. In the event of a favourable decision it may be found to bedesirable that the London County Council should, with Government support, promote legislation for this purpose, particularly as there is some doubt whether the  acquisition of the easements along the line of the tunnel is strictly speaking within the powers of the Minis tor of Transport.Two alternative schemes to minimise the interference with the Park are practicable from an engineering point of view and are as follows(1) To continue the tunnel under ground to a point opposite Stafford House within about 50 yards of the Mall. There are however serious practical objections to this proposal, amongst -which may be mentioned the fact that it would more than double the length of the tunnel making it 750 yards Instead of 350 yards.      As the gradients would require to be as follows viz. commencing at the Mall end a down gradient of 1 in 20 for 130 yards, followed by a level length of 100 yards and then by a gradient of 1 in 25 for 330 yards;    then practically a lovel length of 310 yards followed by a gradient 1 in 20 for 220 yards Into Berkeley Square;    the roadway would be of a switchback character and therefore inconvenient to traffic.A tunnel of this character of a length of nearly h mile, would present some difficulties in the provision of . satisfactory ventilation,  and special machinery would have to be Installed for this purpose.      In these circumstances it is
doubtful -whether traffic would use such a tunnel to any considerable extent.      The additional cost would be approximately  707000.(2) To take the tunnel to about the same point of exit, namely, opposite Stafford House, but so to construct it through the Park that it is partially underground and partially above ground, the above ground portion being covered over with earth and grass.      This would invlove a mound through the Park at least 13 ft. above the present ground level and would, it is thought, be very unsightly and likely to excite much opposition on aesthetic grounds.     Further, it would quite spoil the attractions of Queens Walk which would become a sunken pathway between the houses overlooking the Green Park and the raised -embankment covering the tunnel.     The only advantage of this proposal over the first alternative is that the length of the gradient of 1 in 20 at the Mall end would be decreased by half and the gradient of the tunnel where it is 1 in 25 would be reduced to 1 in 35.      There would be no saving in cost,  and from a traffic point of view it is substantially open to the same objections as the last-mentioned proposal.i am however advised that, from a technical and traffic point of view, neither of these alternatives could be regarded as satisfactory and it is doubtful whether a Tunnel of such a nature would be used by a sufficient volume of traffic to justify its cost of construction.The question,  therefore,   comes to this:-By constructing the Tunnel as originally proposed an important relief to the traffic congestion in Piccadilly could be secured and if we do not now protect the line of the Tunnel the possibility of constructing it at some future date will have -
abeen lost.     On the other hand, the First Commissioner of Works, with whom I have been In consultation, is unable to concur in the sacrifice of the amenities of the park which would be involved by this scheme.      One public advantage has, therefore, to be balanced against another and I must ask the Cabinet to take the responsibility of deciding between conflicting views.(Intld)    H.M.18th July,  1929.
