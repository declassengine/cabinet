[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   Jidy 1929.215SECEET. Copy No.   31CP. 337 (29).CABINET.THE OPTIONAL CLAUSE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of the Cabinet, a note by the Air Staff on the question of the Optional Clause.The Air Ministry is directly concerned with the subject-matter of the last two of the reservations proposed by the Foreign Office in paragraph 72 of CP. 192 (29), viz., (a) belligerent rights, and (b) the areas in which Great Britain has special interests.As regards the former, in the event of future wars, aircraft are certain to play a role of increasing importance in their exercise. To take a single illustration, flying boats, operating in pairs or in larger formations, could effectively undertake the visit and search of suspected vessels, one or more machines remaining in the air as a safeguard against any attempt to escape or to offer obstruction to the boarding party.As regards the latter, the Suez Canal and the Persian Gulf are key areas from the point of view of our Imperial air communications, no less civil than military.T.Air Ministry, Jidy 1929.Note by the Air Staff.The Foreign Office, in paragraph 72 of CP. 192 (29), propose two reservations designed to safeguard respectively our belligerent rights at sea and our position in certain special areas. These questions are both of great interest to the Air Ministry. As regards the former, the Air Staff share the view of the Board of Admiralty that the formula proposed by the Foreign Office should, if possible, be widened. As an alternative to the Admiralty&apos;s proposal in paragraph 5 of CP. 200 (29), they suggest for consideration some such wording as the following : &quot;or which arise out of war measures other than those undertaken by a State which has contravened its obligations under the Covenant.&quot;The effect of this reservation would be to exclude from compulsory submission to the Permanent Court disputes arising out of the war measures of a State not only when (as in the Foreign Office formula) it is acting at the instance of the Council of the League, but also when it is (e.g.,) defending itself (strictly in accordance with the Covenant) before the Council has issued any report.As regards the question of the special areas, the Air Staff, whilst appreciating that there may be overriding political considerations, desire to express the hope that it may be practicable to retain some such reservation as that proposed by the Foreign Office in the final sentence of CP. 192 (29), if, indeed, this cannot be strengthened.Air Staff, Jidy 1929.[19708]
