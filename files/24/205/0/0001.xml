This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty.^ Government.[secret&apos;   - CABINET..CP.201  (29)    . ^_ %  dARMISTICE    DAY. Memorandum by the home Secretary.It will be necessary in the early Autumn to make preliminary arrangements for the celebration of Armistice Day which falls this year on a Monday and as the time available after the Summer Recess will be very limited I should be glad if my Colleagues would consider now the general lines on which they would recommend its observance. 1 presume they vfill desire that November 11th should be celebrated in the customary manner with the usual Service at the Cenotaph, but it has been the practice, and it is obviously convenient, that some member of the Cabinet should be entrusted with the duty of preparing a programme for The King&apos;s approval and with tile general supervision of the arrangements.Since 1924, when the programme was prepared by the present Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Home Secretary for the time being has been charged by the Cabinet with these duties and I.should be glad to know whether my Colleagues desire me to undertake them.    It will of course be necessary to take His Majesty&apos;s Pleasure before definite proposals are formulated.J . R. C .&apos;v; my. . &apos; if&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;   &apos;    . 112th July,  1929.
