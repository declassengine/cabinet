[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    33CP. 207 (29).CABINET.PROPOSAL FOR AN IMPERIAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and .the President of the Board of Trade.WITH reference to the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs of the 2nd July (CP. 188 (29)) on the subject of Inter-Imperial Trade, copies of two telegrams sent to Sir William Clark on the 5th and 8th instant in accordance with conclusion 8 of Cabinet 26 (29), are circulated herewith (Appendix I).On -the 9th instant the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in the House of Commons : &quot; We are at the present time, I do not say engaged in negotiations, but we are in communication with them (i.e., Mr. Bruce and Mr. Mackenzie King) to see whether it may be possible to hold an Imperial Economic Conference to see what we can do to extend inter-Imperial trade&quot; (Debates, the 9th July, column 757); and on the 10th instant, in reply to a question addressed to him by Mr. Hurd, Mr. Ponsonby said that: &quot;As indicated in the recent speeches of the Lord Privy Seal and of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, His Majesty&apos;s Government in. the United Kingdom have under their active consideration the question of the develop-ment of inter-Imperial Trade, and they naturally welcome the indications in statements by members of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Canada and elsewhere, of which reports have reached them, that this question is also under examination in other parts of the Empire. How such trade development can best be brought about is clearly a matter which each Government must to a large extent examine for itself. If, however, there were any general desire for an Imperial Economic Conference to take place before the next Imperial Conference which, according to the present understanding, is due to meet in London next year, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer made clear, gladly participate (Debates, the 10th July, column 869).Mr. Ponsonby&apos;s reply has been telegraphed officially to the Dominions, but no other communication on this subject has as yet been made to them.The latest developments as to the position in Canada will be seen from Sir W. Clark&apos;s telegram No. 157 already circulated to the Cabinet.Further, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has now sent the Prime Minister a message (also circulated to the Cabinet) dealing at length with various issues arising out of the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet Committee on Inter-Imperial Trade has already reached the-conclusion that the idea of an Imperial Conference on economic questions in the near future, if practical, should be welcomed; and the question therefore arises what date and place would be most convenient for such a Conference if it is to be held, and what communication on the subject should next be made to Dominion Governments.As regards the question of date, it is of course most desirable not to arrange a Conference without ample time for adequate preparation. Mr. Bruce&apos;s message supports this view, which indeed is of general application to all the Governments, concerned.Furthermore, it may be assumed that Congress will be considering the question of the United States tariff in the autumn, and it seems to us that for obvious reasons an Imperial Economic Conference must on no account be in Session at precisely that[19604]
time. Far better to wait till we see what the United States decide to do and deal with the situation then arising.In the circumstances, we think that the Government should aim at the holding of an Imperial Conference on economic questions in the spring or early summer of next year.As regards the question of place, the Cabinet Committee reached the conclusion that it would be preferable for Canada to take the initiative in convening such a Conference and that it should be held, if possible, at Ottawa. Indeed, Sir W. Clark has, under instructions, already begun to work for this. Whether it can be effected remains to be seen, but a meeting in a Dominion would emphasise the status of equality laid down at the Imperial Conference of 1926.There remains the question of the next meeting of the Imperial Conference itself. In so far as this must concern itself with Foreign Relations, Defence and political issues generally, it seems still difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to take the initiative in proposing a meeting-place elsewhere than in London.It has occurred to us that one method might be to propose that the Imperial Conference and the proposed Conference on economic questions should be amalgamated into one Conference, which should be held in two portions, the first portion in a Dominion and the second portion in London.The first portion (i.e., that in a Dominion) should concern itself with economic issues; the second (which would take place after an interval of a few weeks) should discuss political questions.It would&apos;be desirable, of course, that Prime Ministers should as far as possible attend both portions of the Conference; if this were impossible (and we realise the -difficulties), they could probably arrange to be represented at the first and come to the -second.So far as the first portion is concerned, the Dominion Prime Ministers whose presence would be specially necessary would be Mr. Mackenzie King, Mr. Bruce and Sir J. Ward; the two latter might well make Ottawa a stopping-place on the way to London.It seems to us that the Government might put forward this proposal as a possibility and invite views and alternatives. For convenience, we have arranged to be prepared, and annex as Appendix II, two draft telegrams which might be sent to the Dominions if the Cabinet approve in principle of this procedure, together with the draft of a further message to Sir W. Clark.S P.W. G.Dominions Office, July 15, 1929.
APPENDIX I.Canadian Proposals for Development of Inter-Imperial Trade.(1.)Paraphrase Telegram for the Secretary, of State for Dominion Affairs to the High Commissioner in Canada for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.No. 151, Confidential. Your telegram No. 152 has been given preliminary consideration by the Cabinet. Subject has been referred to a Cabinet Committee which will meet next week.In the meantime, Prime Minister would like you to know that, in view of (1) meeting of League of Nations Assembly, (2) the probability of meeting in the near future of an International Conference on Reparations, and (3) the possibility of developments arising out of disarmament discussions, any suggestion for an inter-Imperial Economic Conference to meet before end of October is not likely to be convenient from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.It has to be borne in mind also that the Expert Committee on Operation of Dominion Legislation and Sub-Conference on Merchant Shipping are due to meet in London on 8th October.It would be well for you to explain to Mr. Mackenzie King in this sense if opportunity arises.(2-XParaphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for Dominion- Affairs to the High Commissioner in Canada for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Immediate, Confidential, No. 152.My telegram No. 151. Cabinet Committee, which met this morning, reached following conclusions: 1. That the idea of an Imperial Economic Conference in the near future, if practicable, should be welcomed. It was, of course, appreciated that preparations for such a Conference and for assembly of delegates would be likely to take some time.2. That it would be preferable that the initiative in convening such a Conference should be taken by Canada, and that the Conference should be held at Ottawa, if possible.3. That if circumstances permitted Conference at Ottawa before end of October, considerations mentioned in my telegram No. 151 need not necessarily prevent a suitable delegation being sent from this country.Question is being asked in House of Commons by Hurd on Wednesday, which is being sent to you, together with draft of reply which Government would like to give, in my immediately following telegram. This answer has been prepared in the hope that it will be followed by action on the part of Canada. Please advise whether you think terms of draft answer suitable for the purpose and generally on position. I am assuming that you will consult Mackenzie King at once, and leave it entirely to jour discretion in what manner to approach him. You should let me know immediately if for any reason.you think it unwise to do this. In any case, I should like to receive, some time to-morrow, your observations on answer proposed.
APPENDIX II. (1-)Draft Telegram to Dominions.No.      , Confidential.Following from Prime Minister for Prime Minister /President of the Executive Council.  Begins: His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have now been able to give further examination to question of an Imperial Economic Conference (see Secretary of State&apos;s message of 11th July, Circular A, No. 30). Preparations for such a Conference and for the assembly of delegates would clearly take some time. Further, the work of the Committee on the operation of Dominion legislation and the sub-Conference on Merchant Shipping Legislation, which is due to meet in October, and about which I am telegraphing separated, has to be borne in mind. In all the circumstances it seems doubtful whether we should all be ready for an Economic-Conference before the spring or early summer of next year. The question also arises for consideration whether it would be more generally convenient that such a Conference should be held in a Dominion or in this country.The relationship of an Economic Conference, if held, to the meeting of the Imperial Conference, which is due next year, also requires consideration. It would probably be difficult for the Prime Ministers and other Ministers concerned to attend both an Economic Conference, whether it were held in a Dominion or in this country, in the early months of 1930, and an Imperial Conference in the autumn of 1930 or even in the spring of 1931, nor would it seem desirable to postpone a meeting of the Imperial Conference, which would normally have been due this year, for any length of time. In these circumstances, one alternative which has occurred to us is that it might be possible and desirable to hold the Imperial Conference in two parts, the first of which might meet in a Dominion and the second in London as soon as possible thereafter, the first concerning itself with economic issues and the second with questions of foreign policy and defence, and political questions generally.Will you let me have your views on above suggestion, and any other alternatives which may occur to you together with any comments which you may have as to most appropriate date.  Ends.(2.)Draft Telegram to Dominions.JNo.       .   Secret.Following from Prime Minister for Prime Minister/President of Executive Council.   Begins: My telegram No. has been framed with a view to eventual publication if desired. There is one additional point which I feel bound to mention, but in a separate message. If, as seems likely, Congress is dealing with the United States Tariff in the autumn, it would obviously be most undesirable from a political point of view that an Imperial Conference on economic questions should be meeting concurrently. On the other hand if we can arrange a Conference in the early part of next year, we should be in a position to deal with whatever situation may arise in relation to the United States Tariff Policy.   Ends.Draft Telegram to Sir W. Clark.Confidential, No.Your telegram No. 157,   See Prime Ministers message to Mackenzie King t contained in my: telegrams Nos.       and       .   Former has been drawn in a form which will, it is hoped,&apos; elicit invitation from Canada for first part of proposed Conference next year to be held in Ottawa.   You should take any action possible to help in achieving this result.o
