I This Document is the Property of Hie Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government,]246Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1929.SECRET.Copy No.33CP. 240 (29).CABINET.CEYLON CONSTITUTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE Constitution of Ceylon is at present governed by the Order in Council of 1923, under which, while there is a large Unofficial majority of Elected Members in the Legislative Council, elected on a narrow franchise, all executive power is centred in the Governor and the Official Members. The existing Constitution was regarded, on its inauguration, as merely a temporary expedient for extending popular control over the Administration.The late Government appointed a Commission to report on the working of the existing Constitution, and on any difficulties of administration which may have arisen in connection with it, and to consider and report what, if any, amendments of the Order in Council now in force should be made.The Commission, which consisted of the Earl of Donoughmore, P.C., K.P. (Chairman), Sir Matthew Nathan, P.C., G.C.M.G., the late Sir Geoffrey Butler, K.B.E., M.P., and Dr. T. Drummond Shiels, M.C., M.P., was appointed in August 1927, and presented its report in June 1928. The report was laid before Parliament (Cd. 3131), and recommends the adoption of a Constitution of an original character. The Commission, after full examination, expressed their opinion that the grant of complete responsible government is, under present conditions in Ceylon, impracticable, and their recommendations took another form. Stated very briefly, the recommendations of the Commission had the object of transferring to the elected representatives of the people complete control over the internal affairs of the Island, subject only to provisions which will ensure that they are helped by the advice of experienced officials, and to the exercise by the Governor of certain safeguarding powers.- The chief features of the new Constitution would be the substitution for the existing Legislative Council of a State Council, which would deal with administrative as well as legislative matters; the decentralisation of control from the existing Colonial Secretariat and the arrangement of the Departments of Government into ten groups in charge of Ministers, of whom seven would be Elected Members of the Council, the remaining three being Officials; and the association with each of the seven elected Members in the administration of his Department of a Standing Executive Committee of the State Council. The official Ministers would be the Chief Secretary (in charge of external affairs, defence, public service, administra-tion, &amp;c); the Treasurer, in charge of Finance: and the Attorney-General, in charge of judicial affairs, &amp;c. -On the assembly of a new Council, the members would proceed to divide themselves into these seven Executive Committees, each of which would select its Chairman for appointment by the Governor, the Chairmen so appointed being the Ministers, and being individually responsible, with their Executive Committees, to the Council for the direction and control of the Departments in their charge.The Executive Council would be abolished and the ten Ministers would be constituted as a Board under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary. The Board of Ministers would elect its Vice-Chairman, who would be ex ofhcio leader of the State Council, from among the seven Chairmen of the Executive Committees.The proceedings of the Executive Committees would be reported to the Council in Executive Session, and, as approved by the Council, would be submitted to thePi98361B
Governor for ratification. Similarly, the legislative measures passed by the Council would continue to be submitted to the Governor for his assent. The Governor would have the unqualified right to refuse or reserve his assent, both in executive and legislative matters, but he would not normally exercise this right unless the proposals were such as, in his opinion, to conflict with the provisions of the Royal Instructions issued to him. Those Instructions would define certain classes of legislation to which the Governor would not be empowered to assent unless the Bill contained a suspending clause to permit of reference to the Secretary of State.The Special Commission recommended that the present Property, Income and Literacy Qualifications for the franchise should be abolished and the franchise should be extended, subject to minor reservations, to all men over 21 years of age, and to all women over 30 years, who (a) applied to be registered as Voters, and (b) have resided in the Island for a minimum period of five years. Communal repre-sentation should be abolished, and the strength of the State Council should be increased from forty-nine to a maximum of eighty. I am inclined to regard this figure as rather too high, and am proposing to cut it down to 58.As regards the public services, the Special Commission recommended that the right to make all appointments should be reserved to the Governor, and that there should be reserved to the Secretary of State the final decision in all matters affecting the salaries and conditions of service of all public officers.The report of the Special Commission was laid before the Legislative Council in Ceylon and a prolonged debate took place on the proposals. Opposition to the proposals was no doubt strengthened by the resentment of the Council against certain criticisms made of their proceedings in the Special Commission^ Report. Resolutions were passed by varying majorities, which, in effect, rejected the main proposals of the Special Commission^ scheme. The Secretary of State in the late Government informed the Governor, towards the end of the proceedings in the Council, that in his opinion the recommendations of the Special Commission must be regarded as a whole and while, no doubt, modifications in detail would be necessary when effect was being given to them, he would not be willing to accept any amend-ments in principle which would destroy the balance of the scheme. If it appeared that a substantial majority of the inhabitants of Ceylon would not willingly agree to trial of the scheme as a whole he might feel compelled to reopen consideration of the whole question of any constitutional changes. He fully agreed in the conclusion of the Special Commission that the grant of complete responsible Government is, under present conditions, quite impracticable, and he could hold out no hope that failure to accept the recommendations of the Commission would in any way tend to expedite the possibility of such grant. A message in these terms was communicated to the Council by the Governor after the voting on the more important resolutions had been concluded.The Governor, after prolonged consideration of the situation, sent the despatch of which a copy is appended (Appendix A), in which he fully examined the situation arising from the publication of the Report and the discussion in the Council, and expressed the opinion that the scheme of the Special Commission should, with certain modifications, be given a trial. He stated his impression that the general public would be disappointed if the offer of the new Constitution were not made, or if, having been made, it were not accepted. He thought it not unlikely that many of the Unofficial Members, while they thought it necessary to record their dissent from certain of the recommendations, would not wish to press it, save perhaps in the matter of the franchise, to the length of wrecking the scheme.The one important modification which the Governor proposes relates to the franchise. There is no doubt that this proposal of the Special Commission has excited more opposition than any other, in view of the apprehension with which the Ceylonese regard the enfranchisement of the large floating population of Indian labourers who have no permanent settlement in the Island. To meet this difficulty the Governor proposes that, subject to special provision for the undomiciled, domicile should be made the standard test for enfranchisement. Under his proposals all persons possessing the preliminary requirements of British nationality, a, minimum age qualification of 21 years for persons of either sex, the absence of mental disability or criminal antecedents, and a qualification of residence for six months in the electoral district, should be entitled upon application to be registered as voters if they are domiciled in the Island. For the undomiciled there would be two alternative qualifications.    The one alternative would be compliance with the
franchise conditions of the present Constitution, which would provide for practically all European residents of British nationality and for a number of British-Indians engaged in commerce or professional work. The other alternative would be the pro-duction of a certificate of permanent settlement, which would be granted to an applicant who furnished satisfactory evidence of five years&apos; residence in the Island and, in addition, made an attested declaration to the effect that he was permanently settled in the Island or was residing in the Island with intent to settle therein, and that, while registered as a voter, he would renounce any claim to special protection by any Government other than that of Ceylon.I consider that the Governor&apos;s proposal is a fair and reasonable solution of the difficulty of the franchise, and I propose to adopt it.The Governor made certain proposals for the modification of the Commission^ scheme in minor details, which I propose to settle in correspondence with him.I consider that the proposals of the Special Commission, with the modification as to the franchise suggested by the Governor, should now be placed before the Legislative Council for acceptance, and that, subject to their approval, I should take steps for the preparation of an Order in Council to put the scheme into operation. Minor,questions arising in the preparation of the Order in Council would be settled as they arose. I enclose (Appendix B) the draft of a despatch which I propose to address to the Governor with this object.P.Colonial Office, August 31, 1929.
CEYLON. QUEEN&apos;S   HOUSE,CONSTITUTION. COLOMBO,2nd June, 1929.SIR,I have the honour to submit my observations upon the Report of the Special Commission on the Constitution of Ceylon, and upon the attitude of the Legislative Council and the general public of this Island towards the Commission^ proposals. I regret that I have not been able to complete this despatch more expeditiously. My task has proved to be one of unusual perplexity.2. I have forwarded to you from time to time a number of Resolutions which have been received from various Associations and other bodies, and I have also sent to you the Hansard Report of the debate in the Legislative Council upon the several motions of Unofficial Members in regard, to the Report.3. The Government desired to ascertain the opinions of the Unofficial Members and was anxious to avoid any interference, or semblance of interference, with their complete freedom of expression. It abstained, therefore, from any active participation in the debate. After the debate had come to an end, I had some conversations with several groups of Unoffi-cial Members and with a few such Members individually. The object of those conversations, so far as I was concerned, was to explore, in the atmosphere of a confidential and non-committal exchange of views, any avenues which might be open towards a greater common measure of agreement than had as yet been attained. It was my endeavour to elu-cidate whether, consistently with the main principles of the Commission^ scheme, any modifications or adjustments of particular points could be suggested which I might recommend to you, not necessarily as preferable in my own judgment to the Commission^ relevant proposals, but rathsr as likely to facilitate the achievement of a reasonably wide consensus of opinion in favour of the acceptance of the scheme as a whole. I did not summon any Members to attend, but I gave interviews to all who, either in groups or as -individuals, expressed a wish to see me. It was of the essence of the conversations that they were to be strictly confidential, and I will not report upon them beyond saying that they left me without hope of being able to claim the support of any large majority of the Unofficial Members for any concrete jiroposals which I might put forward. The conversations, however, for my purposes at any rate,  were not wholly unprofitable, since they gave me a clearer understanding than I might otherwise have been able to gain of the difficulties felt on one side or another.4. The most important point at issue is also the most controversial, and to it I have given prolonged and anxious thought. I refer to the question of the franchise.   Here I have been confronted not only with an acuteThe Bight HonourableL.  S.  AMERY,  M.P., &amp;o. &amp;o. &amp;c.
division of local opinion, but also with certain doubts of my own in regard t*o almost every one of the proposals which have been advanced whether in the Commission^ Eeport or by its critics. Of all the items under consideration the franchise is that on which a serious mistake would be the least easily reparable. You will, therefore, I hope, forgive me if I have taken a possibly excessive amount of time to consider and reconsider what recommendation I should make to you on this point.5. It will, perhaps, be convenient if I interpose here a few prefatory general remarks on the Eeport and on the Commissioners&apos; references to the local situation as they found it.6. I am in accord with the Commissioners in desiring that any new Constitution for Ceylon should confer a real advance in self-government. That is the spirit in which the proposals of the Eeport have been framed, and that is the spirit in which I approach them. Their chief attraction for me lies in their sympathy with the aspirations of the people and in their endeavour to surmount such obstacles as might impede the fulfilment of those aspirations. I recognize also that the present Constitution is open to criticism, a priori on grounds of theory, and a posteriori in the light of practical experience. I am fully alive to its disadvantages, actual and potential, and I have no wish to see its supersession needlessly postponed. But I am not persuaded that a position has been created which brooks of no delay, and I can conceive that an intrinsically better and more liberal Constitution might, unless its introduction had been effected with a sufficiently substantial measure of local support, present in its operation even greater difficulties than any which I should expect to arise from a provisional continuance of the admittedly defective arrangements now in force.7. I have now had some twenty-one months&apos; personal conversance with the working of the present Constitution, and whatever my impressions of it may be worth, they do not enable me to associate myself with the Commissioners in ascribing to it &quot; unqualified failure.&quot; Indeed, I am -not sure that the term &quot; failure &quot; is properly applicable at all. I doubt whether the actual results fall very far short of the achievement which even a sanguine expectation might have anticipated from such a Constitution, having due regard to local circumstances as they existed at the time of its commencement. It could hardly have been reasonable to hope that all the old preconceptions, prejudices, and suspicions would vanish forthwith ; that the Elected Members of the Legislative Council, when suddenly vested with effective financial control and the influence which flows from such control, would at once and invariably speak and act with all the circumspection and restraint derivable from a political experience which they had not yet had an opportunity to acquire, or as if the responsibility, which the Constitution left elsewhere, had in fact &quot;been transferred to them ; or that the Government, deprived (save in matters of paramount importance) of the assurance of power to enforce any of its decisions which involved legislation or finance, although still charged with undiminished responsibility for the whole conduct of public affairs, would find no difficulty and make no mistakes in the process of adjustment to the new order of things. The Commissioners have recognized fully and generously that neither the task of the Government nor the position of the Elected Members was easy or unembarrassed, and I need not elaborate this argu-ment. But the conclusion which I have formed from a survey of the conditions and facts as they present themselves to my mind is that, considered comprehensively, the operation of the present Constitution has proved a qualified success rather than an unqualified failure.8. This, of course, can only be a matter of opinion, and I am, far from suggesting that greater weight should attach to my personal opinion than to the considered findings of the Commissioners. Nor do I desire to deal controversially with any passages in a Eeport which, as a whole, is conceived
( a )in a spirit of such sympathetic and helpful understanding of our local con-ditions. Furthermore, I appreciate that not all of the evidence before the Commission is within my cognizance, and that in any event my acquaintance at first-hand with the people and affairs of the Island does not cover any period anterior to the 20th August, 1927. Nevertheless, I believe it to be true and this view is not discordant with the main tenor of the Report that during the last four or five years Ceylonese distrust and suspicions of the Government have become much less acute, and that many misunderstandings have been removed and replaced by a growing disposition towards co-operation. If this is true, then here surely is a notable gain to be recorded on the credit side of the balance sheet. In my judgment, that gain is directly, though not exclusively, duo to the manner in which the present Constitution has been interpreted and handled by the Government and its officers on the one part, and by the Unofficial Members on the other part. There have been other contri-butory factors. There were a few years of superabundant public Revenue, and the Government was thus enabled to undertake work and to meet wishes for which provision could not have been made in times of financial stringency. The appointment of the Special Commission and the prospect of constitutional advance opened out by its appointment and Report have also had an important effect on political life within and without the Legislative Council. These adventitious circumstances have helped in the creation of a pleasanter atmosphere, but I am confident that, but for the conciliatory policy of my predecessor and the response which that policy awakened, my path here could not have been as smooth as I have found it.9. Sir Hugh Clifford&apos;s policy in relation to the Legislative Council has, I think, been misunderstood by some of its critics. It would have been easy for him, as it would have been easy for the Unofficial Members, had he or they so desired, to press differences-of opinion to points of crisis or deadlock. It might not have been difficult for him to foster and utilize possibilities of internal dissension among the Unofficial Members in such a way as to secure the advancement of Government business by the j)rocess of playing off one group of members against another. The former course would almost inevitably have produced a state of affairs calling for the early revision of the Constitution : the latter, though it might occasionally have succeeded as a temporary expedient, would have been foredoomed to failure as a permanent method. Sir Hugh Cliffords policy, as I apprehend it, was to treat the Unofficial Members as potential collaborators rather than as an irreconcilable Opposition; to dispel their suspicions of the Governments sincerity and honesty of purpose by taking them into his confidence and affording them an insight into the working of the administrative machine ; to give time for fuller and calmer consideration, either through postponement of a decision or through reference to a Committee, where an immediate forcing of the issue seemed likely to preclude any prospect of ultimate agreement ; and to study the wishes of the Electorate, as expressed by its representatives in the Council, in correlation with his sense of the exigencies of the public interest.10. Obviously such a policy was bound to involve occasional compromise and occasional delay. It is very intelligible that the intrusion of political limitations into the legislative and administrative functions of the Govern-ment should have had a disconcerting effect on the minds of public servants who had been accustomed to obtain decisions of a finality qualified only by the overriding powers of the Secretary of State. It was not always appreciated that methods had to be adapted to conditions differing widely from any which had  (receded the advent of the new Constitution, and it is not surprising that in the eyes of many the Government should have appeared as vacillating and invertebrate. There has, however, been some misapprehension of facts in regard to the nature and extent of the concilia-
tion which was practised. Delay may have been an incident of patient and ultimately successful tenacity rather than a step in a process of surrender. In compromise there may have been a fair reciprocity of concession. It is not axiomatic that in differences of opinion all right and reason must always have been on the one side only. Views may have been revised in the light of argument, not merely under the impulse of weakness. I am not con-cerned to suggest that at times the bounds of legitimate criticism may not have been exceeded by the Unofficial Members, or that the Government may not upon occasion have carried suavity of manner further than was necessary and perhaps even judicious. I do not suggest that the line between the proper functions of the Executive and the proper functions of the Legislature was always defined and observed with sufficient precision. But I venture to think that the picture presented in the Report is a little overdrawn.11. The Commissioners seem to me to have been misinformed in their statement that &quot; in the last five years the tendency has been for theExecutive Council to be less frequently consulted than formerly.&quot; I have before me figures showing the number of references to the Executive Council for each of the years from 1923 to 1928.   They are as follows :In 1923 ... ... ... ... 1.0471924 ... ... ... ... 1,1011925 ... ... ... ... 1,257192G ... ... ... ... 1,5451927 ... ... ... ... 1,850192S ... ... ... ... 2,227.Owing to expansion in the work of the Government, there has been a large increase in the number of references obligatory under some statutory or quasi-statutory requirement, but the number of references ordered by the Governor at his discretion has also increased very considerably. In 1923 it was 241, in 1927 it was 405, in 1928 it was 52.1. The Executive Council is in fact very fully consulted by me, and it exercises a very potent influence on the Governments policy and decisions. I am not aware of the grounds on which the Commissioners base their conclusion that all important business has been diverted from the Executive Council to the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council. Decisions of the Govcrnor-in-Council which involve legislation, or the expenditure of public funds, or the imposition of taxation, or the making of such Rules as the Legislative Council is. empowered by Statute to rescind, are dependent for their effective-ness upon the eventual concurrence of the Legislative Council, unless they relate to matters of paramount importance or to those few matters in which the Governor has statutory authority to appropriate Kevenue without reference to the Legislature. To that extent the decisions of the Governor-in-Council lack the finality which would have attached to them in the da3&apos;s when the Government was in a position to control a majority of the votes in the Legislative Council. That, however, is a necessary consequence of the provisions of the Constitution, and is not attri-attributable to any policy adopted by the Government or to the manner of its apjilication. I cannot recall a single instance in which I have caused the Finance Committee to be consulted before I referred a question to the Executive Council, and in papers which have come before me I have seen nothing to indicate that such a practice was habitually or ordinarily followed by my predecessor. No doubt, there have been occasions when the Exeeu-tive Council has advised that some particular question should be left to be decided by the Legislative Council, but conversely on other occasions the Executive Council has advised against the acceptance of some Resolution or amendment adopted, or likely to be adopted, by the Legislative Council, and the Government has acted upon that advice. The authority of the Executive Council, similarly to the authority of the Governor, has of necessity become less absolute than it was prior to the transfer of power in the Legislative Council from an official to an unofficial majority, but it has not undergone the almost complete eclipse ascribed to it by the Commissioners.
12. I recognize that the Finance Committee system, as a system, is open to the criticisms passed upon it in the Report. But it has had some compensating advantages. However that may be, it will be understood that the Unofficial Members, having once secured financial control, would not have been prepared to relinquish any of the resultant power by waiv-ing insistence on their right to be consulted, not only before any money not previously voted was spent or promised, but also before any money voted for one specific service was diverted to another. Any attempt by the Government to act in anticipation of subsequent covering sanction would, except in cases of obvious and urgent necessity, have been keenly resented. It would have been regarded as an invasion of the constitutional powers of the Council, and sanction which would readily have been given in advance might well have proved unobtainable, or obtainable only with great difficulty, retrospectively. A Government able to claim the support of a Parliamentary majority as a condition of remaining in office can afford in such matters to take risks which could not be taken by a Government situated as is the Government of Ceylon under our present Constitution, unless indeed habitual recourse to the use of the Governor&apos;s reserve powers should have been contemplated. Moreover, unforeseen and unforeseeable points ai-e sometimes raised here by Unofficial Members upon proposals which the Government had believed to be entirely innocuous. And, in the absence of an organized party system and even of leaders who could give a -confident assurance as to the attitude of any one but themeselves individually, opportunities for informal negotiation or informal sounding of the views of the Unofficial Members through such leaders have not been available to the Government. In these circum-stances the Government has been obliged to apply to the Council for prior authority in respect of trivial as well as of important financial readjust-ments, and of the former the number in the course of a year is inevitably very considerable. Eevotes of money granted but left unspent during the previous year also become necessary at times. Of late the Govern-ment, with a view to economy, has discouraged, so far as possible, departmental and other requests for supplementary supply in respect of new services, and has ordered them to stand over for consideration with the next Budget, but even so, they cannot be wholly eliminated. All these various applications are referred to the Finance Committee. I may perhaps mention parenthetically that the Finance Committee, as such, is not concerned with the passing of the Budget, but with matters arising after the Budget has been passed. The Budget itself is referred to the Budget Committee. The constitution of both committees is identical, and both sit in private, but there is this difference that the record of the proceedings in Budget Committee is printed and a copy of it furnished confidentially to every member, whereas the record of the proceedings in Finance Committee is not printed and is kept under lock and key in the Secretariat. Practically all the applications which come before the Finance Committee are interconnected with the business of one or other of the public departments, and as this Committee sits once in almost every month of the year, its members have been afforded very frequent opportunities to raise questions and make representations upon adminis-trative matters. This the Government could not have prevented save by an embarrassingly rigorous abstention from financial applications between Budget -and Budget. It might have been preferable if such applications could have been referred to an ordinary Committee of the whole Council. There the votes of all the Official Members would have been available to the Government, whereas the Finance Committee includes only three Official Members. Some of the points raised and some of the things said in. Finance Committee might not have been raised or said in the publicity and the more formal atmosphere of the ordinary Committee of the whole Council. On the other hand, proceedings conducted in private were likely to be less rhetorical and more businesslike, and it would be easier for members to reconsider, in the light of discussion, opinions to which they
had not committed themselves publicly. Nor, upon a broad general survey of the facts within my knowledge, should i be disposed to say that the Finance Committee had dealt otherwise than reasonably and generously with most of the financial business referred to it. Occasional disagree-ments there have been, occasional delays, occasional decisions, which the Government has thought unfortunate, but they have been the exception rather than the rule.13. Even in matters not arising directly out of specific financial applications some informal preliminary consultation and discussion, for which the periodical meetings of the Finance Committee offered oppor-tunities, must often have been helpful to both Government and Unofficial Members in the removal of misconceptions and the avoidance of unnecessary conflict. For some little time now, however, the tendency has been increasingly to confine the proceedings of the Committee to the consideration of the financial items explicitly referred to it. A suspicion had grown up in some quarters here that important questions of policy were settled behind closed doors in Finance Committee instead of publicly in open Council, and that hole-and-corner bargains were effected between the Government and the Unofficial Members in Finance Committee by mutual concessions which neither side would have been willing or able to avow. I can assert without any hesitation that nothing of the kind has happened since I took over, the charge of the Government, and i am satisfied by assurances which I accept unreservedly that nothing of the kind happened prior to my assumption of office. I think it right to state this emphatically, in fairness to the Unofficial Members as well as in fairness to the Government, and in fairness particularly to Sir A. G. M. Fletcher, the Colonial Secretary, who has been designated by local rumour, perhaps unworthy of attention but nevertheless persistent, as the negotiator of the alleged unavowed and unavowable &quot; deals.&quot; Unfounded though the suspicion is to which i have alluded, it seems best that nothing should be done which could be misinterpreted as giving colour.to a belief in its truth, and i do not think that a continuance of these suspicions and allegations need now be apprehended.14. The interest which the Unofficial Members, whether in Finance Committee or in open Council, take in details of administration has at times proved embarrassing in some of its manifestations. i may be mistaken, but my impression is that many of these members started with a preconceived theory that the Government generally and some of its senior officers in particular might, unless closely watched and continuously pressed, be tempted to impede by administrative action or inaction the consummation of certain courses of policy which the Government had undertaken to adopt or at any rate to consider sympathetically. An assumption of this nature, especially in matters into which the racial factor might be thought to enter, would go far towards accounting for the development of a suspicious temper and of inquisitorial methods. The Government, having nothing to conceal and being anxious to dispel a mistrust which it knew to be groundless, was only too ready to submit to interrogation, and thus, no doubt, it has exposed itself to the Commis-sioners&apos; criticism that &quot; not only was the Finance Committee permitted &apos;* to concern itself with details of administration which were outside its &quot; legitimate sphere, but it was definitely encouraged by the Government &quot; to do so.&quot;15. Even had the Unofficial Members been free, from the preconception by which I believe them to have been influenced, it would have been difficult for them to leave administrative detail untouched. There were inter-communal rivalries which sought expression. There were all the persons with a grievance who appealed to their local member after failing to secure from a Government Agent or other Head of a Department or from the Governor the relief which they desired. Many such persons are, or have been, in the service of the Government, and the information supplied by
.&apos;- ( 7 )them would usually relate to Departmental affairs not always directly relevant to the particular grievance. An Elected Member cannot be expected wholly to ignore electoral considerations, and in any event the representations made to him might appear sufficiently impressive to warrant a feeling that there was need for investigation.iG. The Unofficial Members probably did not appreciate that the attitude which in the ventilation of these suspicions or grievances or representations they adopted towards the Government and some of its senior officers was liable to misconstruction outside the Council, where the allowance to be made for political exigencies, for habits of diction derived from local forensic antecedents and for the embellishments of rhetoric could not so easily be assessed as by those in charge of the Government&apos;s business within the Council. It was not, I am convinced, their intention to undermine executive authority&apos; in the country, or discipline in the Public Service. Perhaps the Government ought to have been a little less long-suffering, a little move emphatic in its warnings of the risk which was being incurred, although it seems very doubtful to me whether in the state of feeling which existed a few years ago such admonitions would have received serious attention, and it is possible that the improvement in feeling which has come about might have been retarded but for the good humour and forbearance shown by the Government. Some harm has been done, but not so much as might have been expected by an observer unfamiliar with oar lceal circumstances, and I do hot think that the harm clone need prove irreparable. The most regrettable effect has been the sense of uneasiness and insecurity created among officers of the senior ranks of the Public Service. Their apprehensions, in so far as they related to material terms ot employment; were caused rather by things which were said than by things which were done. No class of public servants has, in fact suffered any loss of pay or of leave or pension rights through any action of the Council. On the contrary, these conditions of service, where they have been altered, have, generally speaking, been improved. In such matters the Council hitherto has dealt liberally with the Service, and it is fair to mention that my predecessors much-criticized decision to refer the proposed new Pension Scheme to the Council, although such reference was not obligatory under the law, has nevertheless been justified by the result, which has enabled the Government to bring the scheme into operation with the full concurrence and support of the Council. Some of the trouble has, I think, arisen through a false analogy in the application of House of Commons procedure. There was a tendency to overlook the difference between the functions and position of a Minister and those of a Head of a Department, and to criticize and address permanent officials as if they had been political office-bearers. It should also be remembered that the embarrassment caused b\r questions or motions which reacted unfavourably on &quot;the maintenance of authority or discipline must have pressed with peculiar weight on officers charged with the duties of Heads of Depart-ments or of Government Agents. But the chief cause of perturbation probably lay in the consciousness of impact upon suspicion of motives. 1 do not suppose that Unofficial Members, if as I believe they were obsessed by a preconceived theory that some of these officers were not &quot; playing the game &quot;, could have recognized how wounding it must be to a conscientious and honourable public servant to find his conduct questioned on the basis of such an imputation. Ordinarily, I should think, it was not so much the actual language used as the underlying assumption which made attendance before the Finance Committee an unpleasant ordeal to most of the Heads of Departments. It may safely be postulated that this was not the deliberate purpose of Unofficial Members generally, and that they did not fully visualize the effect which was produced. At any rate, the observations of the Commissioners upon the relations between the Unofficial Members and the Public Service seemed to come to the Ceylonese Unofficial Members as a surprise and a shock.   The same facts assume different
aspects in different minds according to the point of view from which their consideration is approached, and in this context the facts, as apprehended by the Ceylonese Unofficial Members, appeared to them to have been interpreted unfairly in the Report. They felt also that, as they had not been afforded a prior opportunity of rebuttal, the case had been prejudged against them. They have recorded their protest and repudiated the finding in the first of the series of the Council&apos;s Resolutions on the Report. On this Resolution the vote of the Ceylonese Unofficial Members was unani-mous. The Resolution was discussed at some length, and the feeling which was expressed affected the tenor of much of the subsequent proceedings.17. The Hansard report of the speeches delivered upon this Resolution is before you, I will not attempt to analyse them or to comment upon them. In the main they relate to matters of which I have no direct personal knowledge. Not being a member of the Finance Committee, I have had no opportunity of attending its meetings and acquainting myself with the atmosphere of its proceedings. Knowing the Ceylonese, as I do, to be by nature a courteous and kindly people, I should find it difficult to believe that the Unofficial Members in Finance Committee could have intended to treat Heads of Departments with the &quot; grave discourtesy &quot; attributed to them on page 23 of the Commissioners&apos; Report. On the other hand, I know that Heads of Departments not infrequently have come away from attendance before the Finance Committee with a sense of ill-usage. As I have indicated above, my impression is that the true explanation may probably be found in a clash of assumptions rather than in any deliberate predisposition to give or to take offence. But there have, I fear, also been incidents in which the heat of argument has induced an over-emphasis of diction, and others even into which an element of personal animus may have seemed to enter. So far, however, as I have been able to ascertain, such incidents have been of comparatively rare occurrence, and I do not interpret the relevant observation of the Commissioners as suggesting that the occasions on which Heads of Departments may have been subjected to &quot; personal insult &quot; were other than quite exceptional. If anything of this kind had happened in Finance Committee since I have been in the Island, I could hardly have failed to hear of it, and no such report has in fact reached me. Nor do I gather that in the past such regrettable incidents have been numerous, or that they have been specially associated with Sir A. G. M. Fletcher&apos;s occupancy of the Chair of the Finance Committee. I have no reason to suppose that he has been less concerned than other occupants of that Chair to afford, or less effective in affording,&apos; to Heads of Departments any protection which it was in his power to give. An allegation in a contrary sense has been read into a passage in the Rep.ort, and I think it right that such an inference should not be left uncontro-verted. In my belief, the conditions which have been mainly operative in prejudicing relations between the Unofficial Members and Public Servants belong to a passing phase, and although that phase has not yet passed away completely,- a better mutual understanding is in process of growth. However that may be, experience has shown that, for the purposes of most of the business which now comes before the Finance Committee, the requisite explanations can be given by the Official Members of the Committee, and that the attendance of Heads of Departments is necessary only when technical or very intricate questions are involved.18. The Commissioners&apos; description of the general attitude of the Unofficial Members towards the Government seems to me too sweeping. That attitude&apos; has been critical always, perhaps hypercritical at times, but not continuously hostile. On balance, I should say that co-operation had outweighed opposition, and I should be ungrateful if I did not acknowledge this. The holder of my office is not likely to underrate its difficulties and embarrassments. I do not pretend that I live a life of unruffled ease, but if the Unofficial Members had been as unhelpful as several passages in the Report might be taken to imply,
( y )the Governor&apos;s task must have become well-nigh impossible of performance. I have not found it -so. The present Constitution is not one under which either the Government or the Unofficial Members could hope to do them-selves the fullest justice, but the sum total of achievement during the past four or five years does not seem to me discreditable to either party or contemptible in itself. There was some lee-way to be made up in respect of expenditure which had been deferred during the preceding period of &quot;financial stringency, and although very much still remains to be done as and when circumstances may permit, the money which has been spent freely has also on the whole, I think, been spent usefully and judiciously. Mistakes may have been made in the assignment of relative priority to the various clamant requirements. Any such process of selection cannot but fail to give universal satisfaction. The funds available were, not unlimited in amount, and no Government or Legislature, whatever might have been the Constitution in force, could have hoped in the space of a few years to solve every problem and meet every want. Considerable progress has been made in such matters as Education, the provision of Hospital facilities and other Medical or Sanitary Services, the construction and improvement of buildings, roads and bridges, and the prosecution of agricultural research work, to name only some of the more important objects of expenditure. The conditions of employment under Government have been generally ameliorated, and some taxation has been remitted. It is true that, although the Revenue has been remarkably elastic, its growth is now being outstripped by the growth of expenditure. The recent depression in the Rubber and Cocp-palm industries has also reacted upon the immediate financial position, and the necessity for caution in the acceptance of new commitments is indicated. This will entail some retardation in the. pace of development, pending the return of more prosper -ous times, and some increase of taxation will have to be considered. There is no occasion, however, for gloomy forebodings. Lean years must be expected from time to time under any form of government, and Ceylon has great recuperative possibilities. It is unfortunate that the evolution of a satisfactory land policy has proved so complex a problem as to have delayed the opening-up of new areas suitable for the cultivation of some of our major economic products, on which the expansion of local prosperity largely depends. Both the Government and the Legislative Council have been blamed for this, not without some show of reason in so far as the embargo placed on the disposal of blocks of Crown land of more than a very small acreage may have been unnecessarily rigid. It is to be hoped that the final Report of the Land Commission will be received in the near future, and that it will then become feasible to relax the embargo without risk of jeopardizing the retention of sufficient suitable land for the reason-able present and prospective needs of the villagers.19. Although my account of the situation differs from that of the Commissioners on the points which I have indicated, I am otherwise in general agreement not only with their comments on the present Constitution but also, subject to certain reservations, with their proposals for the future. It was to be expected that so perspicacious and sympathetic a Report would be accorded at first sight a very favourable reception by public opinion here. Subsequently there came a period of analytical examination of detail, and then individual or sectional apprehensions and disappointments in regard to particular items began to overshadow the initial collective approval. That tendency pervaded the whole of the debate on the Report in the Legislative Council. Of the long series of motions, each dealt with some particular item and was discussed, for all practical purposes, as an isolated proposition. I think it safe to say that, but for the irritation which had been caused by some of the Commissioners&apos; references to the Unofficial Members, coupled with the effect of internal divergences of opinion on the question of the franchise, criticism would have been expressed in a less uncompromising tone.   It is fair also to remember that the Council had
( io )not before it an offer of the Constitution recommended by the Commissioners, but was rather in the position of being invited to indicate whether, and to what extent, such an offer, if made, would be acceptable. It was manifestly reasonable in itself, as well as courteous to the Council, that you should have deferred the definition of your own attitude until you were able to take the views and wishes of the Unofficial Members into consideration. During the progress of the debate, however, it became apparent that motions were being adopted which were destructive of some of the fundamental principles, and subversive of the balance, of the whole scheme, and that a Constitution framed on the basis of those motions would bear little or no resemblance to the Constitution recommended in the Eeport. You called attention to this by telegraph, and I communicated your observations to the Council in a message of which, for convenience of reference, I reproduce the full text below :The Governor, who had reported to the Secretary of State by telegraph the results of the voting in the Legislative Council upon the several motions grouped under Head II. (Government by Committee, election of ministers, and divorce of Administration from Legislative Functions) and Head III. (Governors Powers) in the debate upon the recommendations of the Special Commission on the Constitution, has been authorized to communicate to Honourable Members the following observations of the Secretary of State for the Colonies : &quot; It will be recognized that the recommendations of the Commission were framed after full and anxious inquiry during which all interests were given an opportunity of being heard. In my opinion the recommendations must be regarded as a whole, and while no doubt modiScations in detail will be necessary when effect is being given to them, I should not be willing to accept any amendments in principle which would destroy the balance of the scheme. If it appears that a substantial majority of the inhabitants of Ceylon would not be willing to agree to a trial of the scheme as a whole, I might feel compelled to reopen the consideration of the whole question of any constitutional change. In that event it would certainly be necessary to proceed in due course with the election of a new Council under the Order in Council of 1923, to allow time for further consideration pf the situation. If effect can be given to the recommendations of the Commission, I should propose to take steps for a short extension of the term of the existing Council, if necessary, pending preparation of the preliminary measures. I fully concur in the conclusion of the Special Commission that the grant of complete Responsible Government is under the present conditions quite impracticable, and I can hold out no hope that failure to accept the scheme of the Commission will in any way tend to expedite the possibility of such a grant.&quot;When the Governor received the telegram conveying these observations, the discussion of the motions grouped under Head IV. (Franchise) had been begun, and he thought it desirable to avoil any semblance of intervention in that discussion. He is writing this Message for presentation to the Council as soon as the voting upon the motions grouped under Head IV. has been completed; be is wholly unaware at present what the result of that voting will be.If the Governor does not misapprehend the feeling of the Council although this, of course, can be only a matter of surmise he believes that, possibly with some few exceptions, Honourable Members generally would not wish their recorded dissent from certain of the recommendations of the Commission to be regarded as implying their rejection of the Commission&apos;s scheme as a whole. There would, however, appear to be some risk that the method of dealing with particular items of the Commission^ recommendations separately as independent propositions rather than in their&apos; collective aspect of inter-relation in a comprehensive scheme of advance in self-Government may produce an erroneous reflection of the attitude and intentions of Honourable Members.As it will be the Governor^ duty in making his report to the Secretary of State to convey not only his own opinions upon the recommendations of the Commission, but also his impression of the views and wishes of the Unofficial Members of the Council, as well as of the general public, so far as he may have been able to ascertain them, it has occurred to him that Honourable Members might perhaps desire to discuss the position with him in a less formal manner than would be possible at an open meeting of the Council. Should this be desired he would be very ready to afford an opportunity to the Unofficial Members to meet him either in a body, or if they should prefer it, by a small but representative delegation, on the understanding that the conversations which might take place would be confidential and &quot; without prejudice,&quot; and that any conclusion which might provisionally be reached would not be deemed to commit Honourable Members unless it were embodied in.an Unofficial motion and accepted by the Council. The Governor would not, however, wish in any way to press this suggestion upon Honourable Members, if it should not accord with their inclinations.
It had seemed to me conceivable, thought I was not sanguine, that even then some of the inter-communal disagreements which were the chief obstacle to a comprehensive consideration of the scheme as a whole might have been capable of adjustment through an informal and private exchange of views in the tranquil atmosphere of Queen&apos;s House. Presumably such a reconcilia-tion or compromise of differences was not felt by the Unofficial Members to be feasible at that juncture. At any rate, the remainder of the debate took its course on the previous lines, and the conversations which I had afterwards with Unofficial Members as individuals or in groups were negative in result. Nevertheless, I still think that it was not the intention of the Unofficial Members to reject the Commissioners&apos; scheme absolutely, and I believe that now a few months&apos; quiet reflection has improved the prospects of acceptance. It seems not unlikely to-me that many of the Unofficial Members, while they thought it necessary to record their dissent from certain of the recommendations, would be content with having placed their dissent on record and would not wish to press it, save perhaps in the matter of the franchise, to the length of wrecking the scheme, if you decided that insistence on such dissent would have that consequence. My impression is that the general public would be disappointed if an offer of the new Constitution were not made, or if, having been made, it were not accepted.20. One feature of the scheme which has caused me some hesitation is the increase iii administrative expenditure which would be unavoidable. I am referring, not to those very desirable projects of social betterment which the Commissioners hope to see promoted by the advent of the more democratic institutions of the proposed new order, but to the cost of the ordinary machinery of Government requisite for carrying on the business of administration. It is not merety a question of the direct fresh charges in respect of such items as the salaries of Ministers and their Secretaries and of the. Officers of the State Council, or the increased expenditure directly entailed by a large increase in the number of Councillors; it is also a question of the additions to clerical establishments which must be contem-plated if the Committees are to be enabled to function adequately, and the incidental expansion of requirements under such heads as offiee-accommoda-tion, printing and other subsidiary services. I am not in a position at this stage to give a reliable estimate, but I should be agreeably surprised if the increase in the annual running-cost of the administrative machine proved to be less than Es. 1,000,000. That is an uncomfortable figure to add to an annual recurrent expenditure for which our present annual revenue barely suffices, but it is not so alarming that it need stand in the way of a constitutional advance desired by the people. In any event some increase of taxation will become necessary before long, and inconvenient though it might be, it should not prove impossible then to include provision for this addition to the cost of administration. It would be my hope, however, that such provision might be made before the new Constitution came into operation. It would be unfortunate if one of the earliest duties of the new Government had to be the imposition of increased taxation for purely administrative purposes. It would seem better that this ungrateful task should be undertaken by the present Government than that the Ministers and State Council should, be obliged to incur the unpopularity of it at the outset of their career; as some time would have to elapse between the acceptance of an offer of the new Constitution and the completion of the subsequent preparations for its introduction, the present Government may expect to have an opportunity of dealing with this matter. The Commis-sioners probably were less conscious than I am of our financial limitations, and they may not have appreciated that the system of administration which they have recommended would have to be financed at a time when a perceptible increase of taxation had become unavoidable. That contingency, however, cannot be ignored, and it seems to me an added reason for insisting upon a definite expression of local acceptance as a condition precedent to the introduction of the proposed reforms.
21. I turn now to the vexed question of the franchise. I agree with the Commissioners that an advance in self-government should be accompanied by a broadening of the present electoral basis; that women should be admitted to the suffrage; and that communal representation is not a desirable ingredient in the composition of a democratic Constitution. The abolition of communal representation, however, is the proposal which has caused the greatest local difficulty. The Sinhalese ace very ready to accept? it, but they are the one community which has gained nothing, and might be liable to lose something, by the retention of communal represen-tatives in a territorially elected Council. If territorial representation is not to be swamped, communal representation must be confined to the small minority communities. Under the system now in force, these minority communities enjoy, man for man,, a greater voting power than the Sinhalese, since they have communal as well as territorial votes. In the constituencies which are not controlled by the Ceylon Tamils the territorial vote of the minority communities is not, under the present franchise, likely to imperil the Sinhalese majority over all other electors, but in the Legislative Council, as now constituted, the communally elected represen-tatives could, if they voted solidly with the territorially elected Tamils, place the representatives of Sinhalese territorial constituencies in a minority of the elected membership, although sixteen of the twenty-three purely territorial constituencies may be described as Sinhalese. Voting has not, in fact, proceeded on these lines, and there is little prospect of future divisions in which the issue would be defined as between Sinhalese and the rest. Nevertheless, the presence in the Council of a considerable number of communally elected members detracts potentially from the influence which, but for that factor, would be assured to the Sinhalese in virtue of their numerical preponderance and their territorial distribution. It is intelligible, therefore, that the Sinhalese, as a community, should deprecate any attempt to preserve communal representation, or any compromise of the effect of its ostensible abolition beyond the point of limitation which would inhere in the proposed power of the Governor to nominate not more than twelve members of the State Council. This must be borne in mind if one of the principal grounds of controversy in regard to the enfranchisement of Indian labourers under the qualification reeom-mended by the Commissioners is to be understood: for it is only in constituencies which might otherwise be classified as Sinhalese that the communal balance would be liable to be affected appreciably by such enfranchisement.22. The Sinhalese probably are less communal, in outlook than some of the minority communities, but obviously a broad national view is more easily taken when it happens to coincide, than when it happens to conflict, with communal interests. The Ceylon Tamils are concerned lest they should suffer some diminution of their political influence and their prospects of employment in the public service as a result of electoral redistribution on a strictly numerical basis. They would always be assured of some constituencies in the Northern and Eastern portions of the Island, but the ratio of those constituencies to the others would presumably be smaller under the new Constitution than the ratio fixed in 1923, and the Tamils would lose, in addition, their present communal constituency in the Western Province. They are apprehensive, unduly perhaps but genuinely, of Sinhalese political dominance unchecked on the one side by a disproportionately-disproportionately generous allocation of seats to the Tamil portions of the Island and on the other side by the counterpoise of communal representation. Any wide extension of the franchise would be likely in itself to prove more favourable to the numerically larger than to the numerically smaller communities, and if there is to be an approximation to manhood and womanhood suffrage, it is not surprising that the general enfranchisement of the Indian labourers should commend itself to the mind of many of the Ceylon Tamils as conducive to some readjustment of the balance.
23. If to the Ceylon Tamils communal representation is of interest mainly as a counterpoise to the numerical preponderance of the Sinhalese, tc the Muslims and Burghers it presents itself almost as their only assured safeguard against tho risk of political submersion. Probably, though not certainly, one of the new constituencies in the Eastern Province would contain a clear majority of Muslim voters. These would be Ceylon Moors. Elsewhere the Muslims, whether Ceylon Moors or Ceylon Malays, must expect, in view of their geographical distribution, to be outnumbered by other communities, and it is hardly conceivable that in any of the new constituencies the Burghers would not be in a minority. It is to be hoped that communal sentiment would not be the decisive factor in all elections. The Sinhalese at any rate could afford to be generous, and I credit them with generous instincts in these matters. I feel confident that there would be no desire for the wholesale exclusion of Muslims, Burghers and Europeans from election to membership of the State Council. But nobody can be in a position to give a binding pledge that in any constituency communal sentiment might not turn the scale, and to the extent of that uncertainty, therefore, the electoral prospects of Muslims, Burghers and Europeans must necessarily be hazardous. I have also heard apprehensions expressed that the many thousands of relatively uneducated and inexperienced men and women who would be added to the Voters&apos; Boll, might be more susceptible to racial or religious bias than the present Electorate. Whether or not the widening of the franchise would produce such an effect, I can think of several likely candidates, belonging to Minority Communities, whose personal popularity and local influence should suffice to give them an excellent chance of election in their respective districts, provided that the constituencies for which they might stand were not very large in area. Further opportunities for minority candidates might be afforded by three-cornered contests in which the majority vote would be split. Even so, however, the possibility remains that, except in the one probable Muslim Constituency in the Eastern Province, Muslims, Burghers and Europeans might find themselves unable to enter the State Council otherwise than through the avenue of nomination by the Governor. That is a contingency to which the Europeans are prepared to resign themselves, but the thought of it is distressing to both Muslims and Burghers. Ceylon is their only home, and it would be hard indeed if they and their descendants were to be denied a reasonable hope of a political career in their own country. They would see in the Governors nomination, even if its exercise in their favour could be guaranteed, a palliative rather than a remedy. As Coylonese they would not wish to be differentiated from other Ceylonese members of the Council, and perhaps to be handi-capped in an eventual ambition for political office, by any questioning of the representative quality of their membership.24. I have much sympathy with the Muslims and the Burghers in their anxiety, though I believe that they will not find the difficulties in the way of the election of some members of their communities quite as formidable as they anticipate. I should have been very glad, however, if some means of reassuring them could have been devised. I have given careful consider -ation to a suggestion which was made to me tentatively that, in the event of the result of the Elections being such as to satisfy the Governor of the expediency of nominating one or more Burghers or Moors or Malays on other than purely personal grounds, he should leave it to those communities to elect their candidate or candidates for nomination, and that a similar process of election should precede the nomination, if any, of Europeans. At first sight this suggestion is not unattractive. But the objections seem to mo to outweigh tho advantages. It would be necessary to prepare separate Communal Registers, and this would perpetuate the principle of communal representation which both tho Commissioners and an appreciable majority of our Legislative Councillors wish to eliminate. If the Governor were to be committed to reserving any given number of his nominations for allocation to specified communities, the position would
be the,, same as if the Constitution had provided explicitly for that number of communal seats. If he remained uncommitted, the Minority Commu-nities would not gain the sense of certainty which they desire, and yet the possibility of obtaining admission to the State Council through some process of communal election might tend to remove much of the stimulus upon Members of the Minority Communities to seek territorial election in the ordinary manner. That would be regrettable in the ultimate interests of the minority communities themselves, and prejudicial to the growth of a broad national outlook. The choice seems to me to lie between the complete abolition of communal representation, as proposed by the Commissioners, and its definite retention in its present form, though not necessarily at its present ratio. I am fully conscious of the strength of the feeling against abolition, and I do not regard that feeling as factitious or negligible. But notwithstanding some solicitude on this account, I find myself in agreement with the Commissioners, and I do not recommend that provision for any communal representation should be prescribed in the new Constitution. In view, however, of possible contingencies, I would urge that the ambiguity in the Report as to the qualification of Nominated Members of the State Council for Ministerial Office should be replaced by a clear understanding&apos;that any Executive Committee of the Council would be at liberty, if it saw fit, to elect a Nominated Member as its Chairman. I think it important also that there should be no avoidable restriction of political openings for members of the minority communities, and for this reason, keenly as I am alive to the claims of economy, I cannot advise you to accept the Resolutions of the Legislative Council in favour of a reduction in the number of constituencies and the number of Ministers recommended by the Commissioners.25. Local opinion appears to be generally in accord with the proposal to admit women to the franchise. It is not very palatable to many of our Muslims, and some of our Tamils are dubious, but otherwise nothing which could be described as collective opposition has come to my notice. With a view to limiting the expansion of the Voters&apos; Roll, the Commissioners suggested that the age qualification, which for men is 21 years, should be fixed at 30 years for women. The Legislative Council, however, adopted without a division a motion that the qualifications for the franchise and for membership of the State Council as well as of local bodies should be the same for women as for men. This, I think, was intended to define a principle which should be applicable under any conditions of qualification. On the whole, it seems to me hardly worth while to create a sense of grievance for the sake of avoiding such an increase in the prospective electo-rate as would be involved in the acceptance of the Council&apos;s Resolution, and 1 give that Resolution my support. It may perhaps be necessary, in some parts of the Island at any rate, to make special arrangements for the recording of women&apos;s votes, possibly by the provision of separate polling booths. This is a question on which I would propose eventually to seek the advice of a local committee before framing rules for the conduct of elections under the new Constitution.26. The franchise recommended by the Commissioners does not fall far short of universal suffrage. In addition to the usual reservations in respect of mental disability or criminal antecedents, they have proposed cnly the following three limitations :(1) the exaction of a higher age qualification for women than for men;(2) the requirement of residence for five years in the Island (allowing for temporary absences not exceeding a total of eight months during that period), and for not less than six months, of the eighteen immediately preceding the preparation of the Register, in the electoral district to which the Register relates;(3) the stipulation that only those should be registered who apply for registration.
The Resolutions . adopted by the Unofficial Members would remove two of these limitations, the differential age qualification, and the proviso in regard to the process of registration. Of the special limitations proposed in the Report, only the test of residence would then remain, but on this a Resolution of the Unofficial Members would superimpose a literacy test.27. I must confess to having experienced much difficulty in deciding what recommendation I should make to you. I regard universal suffrage as a very desirable end, but the immediate transition to it (or to the close approximation proposed by the Commissioners) from the present narrow franchise involves so sudden a change that doubts of its prudence have suggested themselves. Moreover, the issue of the relevant debate in the Legislative Council has left a tangled skein to be unravelled. On the one hand, the proposal of the Commissioners has raised in many quarters hero hopes which would be grievously disappointed if the contemplated franchise were to be restricted by the addition of any important limitation. On the other hand, the prospect that a franchise unanimously recommended by the Commissioners, and apparently favoured by a large volume of opinion in the United Kingdom, might be likely to secure adoption has induced some hesitation in the expression of misgivings which I know to have.been felt. I am not prepared to say either that the hopes are unreasonable or that there is no warrant for the misgivings. He would be a bold man who would assert that, under our present local conditions, the whole, or virtually the whole, of the adult population of Ceylon was fit to undertake forthwith the full responsibilities of political power. Conversely, it is difficult to conceive how those portions of the population whose fitness may be in doubt could, so long as they remain unenfranchised, be expected to acquire the political experience which would fit them for the judicious exer-cise of the franchise. The disparity in the cultural scale between a large stratum of the so-called &quot; depressed classes &quot; and what might be described as the governing class of the local population is still very great. It is arguable that it would be unwise to ignore this disparity, and that some educational advance ought to precede the grant of the franchise. It is, however, arguable also that the grant of the franchise would be the most effective stimulus to the extension of educational facilities, which in the absence of that stimulus might continue to progress very slowly, and that the desired educational advance would in fact be more likely to follow than to precede enfranchisement. It is probably true that the admission of the &quot; depressed classes &quot; to political equality with other sections of the population would contribute towards their emergence from- a state of depression, but it must be remembered that distinctions of caste are deep-rooted in the social soil, and that educational and political equality alone might not. suffice to obliterate their implications. Nor are the &quot;depressed classes &quot; by any means the only portion of the population whose present exclusion from the territorial franchise would be removed by the adoption of the Commissioners&apos; recommendations or retarded by the adoption of the literacy test proposed in the Resolution of the Unofficial Members.28. The Commissioners have estimated the maximum possible total electorate which would result from the adoption of their recommendations at 1,850,000. According to an admittedly rough estimate, for which I am indebted to the Director of Statistics, the number of male literates of 21 years and over may be put at 798,000, and the number of female literates of 30 years and over at 163,000. On the basis of these figures the maximum possible total electorate under the Commissioners&apos; franchise proposals would be reduced, by the superimposition of a literacy test, from 1,850,000 to 961,000. The number of literates, which has been calculated according to the ratio shown in the Census returns of 1921, has probably been underestimated, as the ratio of literacy may be assumed to have increased during the last few years. The ratio returned in 1921 may not have been strictly accurate; the application of the standard of &quot; ability to read and write one&apos;s own or some other language &quot; would, no doubt, have
varied with the idiosyncracies of different enumerators, aud I cite these figures, therefore, with all duo&apos; reserve. Even so, however, and even allowing for the appreciable addition which would have to bo made if female literates between the ages of 21 and 30 were to be included, it is clear that the literacy test would have a very drastic effect on the size and composition of the possible total electorate. Tho strongest argument in its favour, to my mind, is that the barrier which it would erect would recede concurrently with the gradual decrease of illiteracy, and that the approach to universal suffrage would be an automatic process conditioned only by the rate of advance in the diffusion of education. While tho literacy test would not prevent a very considerable immediate expansion of tho present electorate, it would mitigate to some extent the risks inherent in a sudden transition to universal suffrage. Conscious as I am of those risks, and reluctant as I am to place myself unnecessarily at variance with an important pronouncement of the Unofficial Members, I had a double inducement to recommend their Eesolution on this point to your favourable consideration. Nevertheless, I do not feel able to support it, but I am so fully sensible of the serious responsibility which I am taking upon myself in advising against its acceptance that I have hesitated long before coming to a definite decision.29. The general trend of public opinion, so far as it has been possible for me to gauge it, seems to be adverse to tho literacy test. Even in the Legislative Council the motion in its favour was carried only by a narrow majority. Seventeen Unofficial Members (including three Europeans) voted for it, fourteen voted against it, and two declined to vote. Unless I am much mistaken, several of the Members who voted for it voted as they did because they thought it necessary that some positive Eesolution should be adopted, and because, of the motions which were not wholly unpalatable to one or other of them on some point or points regarded as crucial, this motion appeared to be the only one capable of attracting a majority to its support. The question of the enfranchisement of Indian labourers may probably have turned the scale in its favour by uniting in one camp some of those who saw in the universal application of a literacy test the only actually attainable means of securing the immediate exclusion of the Indians from the territorial franchise and some of those who saw in it the only actually attainable means of securing their eventual admission. There were some, no doubt, who voted for it because they believed in it on its own independent merits. I recognize those merits in theory, but I do not think that in practice the literacy test would operate satisfactorily. The Commissioners have pointed out &quot;that its application, even under the relative-ly easy conditions of the present limited franchise, has been ineffective. The difficulty of applying it as virtually the only limitation upon universal suffrage would, of course, be immeasurably greater. The number of persons to be subjected to. it, if it were to be applied equitably, would be so large that the work would have to be entrusted to a host of minor functionaries. These would be exposed to the temptation of applying the test less search-ingly to persons of their own respective communities or castes or ways of thinking than to persons not possessed of an initial claim to their sympathy, and even if they were proof against such a temptation, they would infallibly be suspected of yielding to it. Allegations of partiality, to say nothing of corruption, would be unpleasantly frequent, and I am afraid that much ill-feeling would be engendered. That seems to me a formidable objection to the literacy test. There are others. I agree with the Commissioners that the mere smattering of letters which would suffice for the requirements of such an examination in reading and writing as it would be possible .to enforce would not be evidence of educational attainments adequate in themselves to serve as a test of fitness for the franchise. An examination of this kind might admit many who were loss fit than many of those whom it would exclude. A further contingency to be borne in mind is the unfortunate effect which the literacy test, if properly applied, might have
on the composition of the electorate in the Kandyan Provinces, by restricting the voting power of the Kandyan villagers to a ratio far short of any which, under a territorial system of franchise, their proportionate numerical strength in those areas might reasonably entitle them to expect. They have not yet enjoyed educational opportunities equal to those provided in the &quot; low country &quot;, but they have qualities and traditions which are a valuable element in the national life of the Island, and they ought not to be denied a fair share of political influence in predominantly Kandyan districts. It would also seem very regrettable if a test were to be imposed which would leave the great majority of industrial and other manual workers in the towns unenfranchised. There can be little doubt that, for the present, the adoption of the literacy test would produce such a resrdt. This would deprive the State Council, temporarily at any rate, of a claim to be deemed comprehensively representative, and it would open the door forthwith to persistent agitation for the removal of the test. The publica-tion of the Commissioners&apos; Report has so affected the situation that no substantial modification of the principle of universal suffrage would be likely now to be accepted by the people at large as a tolerable solution of the franchise question. I think it desirable, therefore, that any franchise which might be introduced should not be encumbered with a reservation which might be expected to invite the immediate inception of a campaign for its withdrawal. The literacy test would inevitably be attacked as inequitable in its operation and effect, and I doubt whether, in the face of such attack, it could be maintained for very long. More harm might well be done to the body politic by the controversy thus stirred up and kept alive than by a settlement which, even though it were not free from appreciable risks, had at all events some of the attributes of finality. If the reservation had to be abandoned at a comparatively early date, the risks entailed by its absence would in the meantime have been aggravated by the exacerbating influence of the controversy which would have preceded the abandonment.80. It is very improbable that the large numbers of Ceylonese who would be excluded from the franchise by the literacy test would be content to wait patiently until educational facilities had been extended sufficiently to neutralize the restriction. Nor do I believe it to have been the intention of some of those who voted for the test as a &quot;means of preventing the immediate wholesale enfranchisement of Indian labourers, to allow their eventual enfranchisement unconditioned by any requirement other than that of literacy. I feel convinced that, if the literacy test were established, it would not be long before a demand for the imposition of some further limitation on the admission of Indian labourers to the territorial electorate would be advanced and pressed. No one who has had experience of the disturbing effects of &quot;Indian questions &quot; in certain parts of Africa could contemplate with equanimity the emergence of such a question as a political issue in Ceylon. In the interests of internal harmony, in the interests of the economic development of our natural resources in which Indian labour plays so great a part, in the interests of our future good relations with the Government and people of India, it seems to me of the highest importance that this question should be faced and, if possible, settled before it becomes acute. I think it right, therefore, to submit a suggestion by which, in my opinion, the danger might be forestalled and averted. I am under no illusions, and I do not anticipate that the sugges-tion will be much liked. Nevertheless, I believe it to be justifiable on grounds of principle as well as of expediency, and to be more likely to provide a permanent solution of the difficulty than any of the alternative proposals which have been put forward.31. I do not understand the leaders of the movement for the restriction of the Indian franchise to be actuated by prejudice against; Indian labourers as Indians. Exception is taken to their wholesale territorial enfranchise-meht, not because they are Indians, but because they are not regarded
as Ceyloiiese, arid because their numbers great now and probably greater still in future and their concentration in certain areas are such as to constitute a potential menace to the local predominance of the Ceylonese vote. The Europeans also are not regarded as Ceylonese, but in respect of them apprehensions based on numbers and concentration do not arise. There is the obvious further point that Indian labourers for the most part have not enjoyed opportunities for the acquisition of educa-tion or of political experience comparable to those enjoyed by the Europeans. The general circumstances of their lives certainly are less conducive to the formation of an independent judgment, and not more conducive to the formation of a specifically Ceylonese outlook, on public affairs. It is feared in some quarters that the votes of a very large number of the Indians here would be at the disposal of high-caste personages from beyond the Palk Strait, who if they thought it worth-while might manipulate them for purposes and in interests not necessarily appertaining to Ceylon nor unaffected by tendencies which neither Geylonese nor Europeans would wish to see introduced.32. I have mentioned in a previous paragraph that the question of the inter-communal balance of Ceylonese voting strength enters into the question of Indian enfranchisement. The only large concentration of Indian labourers outside of one or two probable constituencies in Colombo is on up-country estates in Sinhalese, and especially Kandyan, areas. It is intelligible, therefore, that the opposition to the wholesale enfranchisement of Indians should emanate principally from the Sinhalese community. To the Ceylon Tamils a powerful Indian vote in Sinhalese areas might not seem an unattractive prospect politically, and their attitude may also be influenced in some measure by considerations of racial, linguistic and religious affinity. In some quarters, notably among the Europeans,there is a strong feeling that there ought to be no derogatory discrimination against British subjects who, although they7 may not be Ceylonese in the usual acceptance of the term, have contributed so greatly by their labour to the economic development of Ceylon. Nor should it be overlooked that many of the labourers classified as Indians were born in Ceylon and have never lived elsewhere.33. The Commissioners have explicitly adopted the view that &quot;the &quot; privilege of voting should be confined to those who have an abiding &quot; interest in the country or who may be regarded as permanently settled &quot; in the Island,&quot; and they describe this condition as &quot; of particular &quot; importance in its application to the Indian immigrant population.&quot; The Sinhalese, so far as I am acquainted with their opinions, are prepared to accept that principle, and I do not think that any of the other com-munities would demur to it. But, whereas the Commissioners consider that a sufficient test of &quot; abiding interest &quot; or &quot; permanent settlement would be provided by the requirement of five years&apos; residence as defined by them, the Sinhalese are not satisfied that this requirement by itself would give the necessary assurance under either head of the test. The disagreement is not as to the principle, but as to the method of its application. The Sinhalese , contend that to the retrospective condition of past residence there should be added some reasonable indication of an intention to remain in Ceylon and thus to associate the immigrants future interests with the fortunes of the Island and its people.34. The residential test, as defined in the Beport, does not seem to me capable of giving general satisfaction if it is to be virtually the sole criterion of electoral qualification. Tightly drawn, the constitutional provision by which it would be expressed would disfranchise very many Europeans and some Ceylonese on grounds of temporary absences in excess of the prescribed maximum number of months. Widely enough drawn to prevent such disfranchisement, it would lose much of its efficacy as a check upon the enfranchisement of Indian labourers, and for that reason it would become proportionately less acceptable to the Sinhalese.   It would in any
circumstances not be regarded as a lasting settlement either of the franchise question generally or of. the question of the Indian franchise in particular.35. The suggestion which I would ask you to consider is that, subject to special provision for the undomiciled, domicile should be made the stan-dard test. I postulate, as of universal application to domiciled and undomiciled alike, the preliminary requirements of British nationality, a minimum age qualification of 21 years for persons of either sex, the absence of mental disability or criminal antecedents, and the condition of residence for six months, of the eighteen immediately preceding the preparation of the register, in the electoral district to which the register relates. Any person so qualified should be entitled, upon application made by him or her in that behalf, to be registered as a voter if he or she were domiciled in the Island. Practically all Ceylonese, a quite appreciable number of Indians and a few Europeans would thus become entitled to registration. For the un-domiciled (including any whose domicile in the Island might be in doubt) I would substitute the choice of either of two alternative qualifications in lieu of that of domicile, subject in both eases to the requirement of applica-tion to be registered as a condition of registration. The one alternative would be compliance with the franchise conditions of the ]Dresent constitution in respect of literacy and the possession or occupation of property or the enjoyment of an income of prescribed value as specified in Article XXVI. (1) (h) of the Order-in-Council of 1923. This would provide for practically all European residents of British nationality and for a number of the British Indians engaged in commerce or in professional work, and it would have the effect of preventing the disfranchisement of any persons now enfranchised or qualified for the franchise. The other alternative would be the production of a certificate of permanent settlement granted by some duly appointed officer. The conditions entitling an applicant to receive such a certificate would be as follows: he or she would be required to furnish satisfactory evidence of five years&apos; residence as contemplated and defined by the Commissioners, and in addition to make before the appointed officer a duly attested declaration to the effect that he or she was permanently settled in the Island or was residing within the Island with intent to settle therein, and that, while registered as a voter, he or she would renounce any claim to special protection by any Government other than that of Ceylon or to any statutory rights, privileges, or exemptions to which residents of all races and communities were not entitled. Only a nominal fee, which need not, I think, exceed one rupee, would be chargeable for the issue of such a certificate. An applicant to whom such a certificate had been refused might appeal to the Governor, whose decision thereon, given in the unfettered exercise of his discretion, would be final. I suggest the Governor rather than a Court of Law as the Appellate authority, in order to protect the appellant against liability to heavy legal expenses. I would provide further that a certificate of permanent settlement should be cancelled, and the name of the person to whom it had been issued should be removed from the register of voters, if he or she were absent from the Island for any continuous period exceeding twelve months, or if after the publication of the voters&apos; roll it were shown to the satisfaction of a duly constituted tribunal that the certificate had been pbtained fraudulently or by state-in ents which were untrue. This device of certificates of permanent settle-ment is intended to afford to Indian labourers and others (although in practice few but Indian labourers would be affected) an easy and inexpensive method of satisfying the test of an animus manendi as a qualification for enfranchisement in the territorial electorate. The requirement of explicit renunciation of any claim to special protection by any Government other than that of Ceylon may very likely be supererogatory, since under the relevant Indian law the status of &quot;emigrant&quot; is forfeited after five years&apos; absence from India. It has been inserted, however, with the object of impressing upon applicants who normally would not be well-informed on such points, that if they should seek and obtain admission to the franchise
here on equal terms with the Ceylonese population, they could not simultaneously retain in Ceylon any of the special privileges to which Indians as distinct from Ceylonese might be entitled, or in other words that the acquisition of equal rights implies the acceptance of equal obliga-tions and liabilities. The formula &quot; permanently settled in the Island or residing within the Island with intent to settle therein&quot; is borrowed from the Naturalization Ordinance of 1890. It seems to require of an applicant noth-ing more than could fairly be expected in the light of the Commissioners&apos; proposition that &quot;the privilege of voting should be confined to those who have an abiding interest in the country or who may be regarded as permanently settled in the Island&quot;, but it provides a more effective test of abiding interest or permanent settlement than could be based merely on the completion of five years&apos; residence. It should not prove, in practice, unreasonably restric-tive, especially if the Commissioners&apos; estimate that between 40 and 50 per cent. of the Indian immigrant labourers may be regarded as permanent residents of Ceylon is correct. In the event of this suggestion being accepted, I would propose to appoint a Committee (in which I would include at least one representative of Indian interests) to advise as to the most suitable machinery for carrying out its requirements. The most difficult point which the Committee would have to consider would be the determination of what should be deemed satisfactory proof of five years&apos; residence, having regard to the large number of potential applicants and to the expediency of simplifying procedure with a view to the avoidance of prohibitive expense or delay in establishing the facts. That particular difficulty would have to be faced under any scheme which comprised a test of five years&apos; residence, if that test were to be applied as a means of admission rather than as a means of exclusion. My impression is that much useful evidence as to residence might be obtainable from the records of the Department of Indian Immigrant Labour, and probably also from estate records, but this and other possibilities might be investigated by the Committee. The application of a test of five years&apos; residence would, in any circumstances, necessarily leave a large number of Indian labourers unenfranchised. It would be open to the Governor to facilitate the representation of their needs and wishes in the State Council by an appropriate exercise of his power of nomination, and it would be open to the Secretary of State, without the insertion of a specific provision in the Constitution which might resuscitate the whole question of a communal franchise, so to instruct the Governor as to ensure that this opportunity should not be overlooked.36. A suggestion resembling in its principal features that which I have propounded was discussed informally while the debate on the franchise question was proceeding in the Legislative Council. A mention of it will be found in one of the speeches delivered towards the end of that debate. It was not brought forward as a motion, because at the time the only positive motion which was thought to have a prospect of support by a majority was that in favour of a universally applicable literacy test. I am not sure that a majority for it would be obtainable now if it were put to tho Council as an isolated proposition, but I believe that an offer of the Commissioners&apos; constitutional scheme as a whole would have a much better prospect of acceptance if it embodied this particular suggestion than if it included neither this suggestion nor provision for a universal literacy test. My objections to the literacy test I have stated above. I think it doubtful, -having regard to the effect of public opinion, whether all the members who voted for that test in November would vote for it again, and I am confident that, outside the Council, grave dissatisfaction would be caused by the imposition of so a drastic a limitation of the franchise. A Constitution which in effect placed no restriction on the Indian franchise beyond the test of five years&apos; residence might, even if the Council accepted it, be expected to give rise to a political agitation likely to embitter future relations between Ceylonese and Indians and to do much more harm than could be caused by the adoption of the additional, not unreasonable restriction which, after very careful reflection, I venture to commend to your consideration.
37. I have not felt able to support, so far at any rate as the preparation of the first Eegister is concerned, the Resolution of the Unofficial Members that all who are entitled to the franchise should be enrolled without being required to apply for registration. The only objection which I can see to the course recommended by the Commissioners is that some trouble and expense might be caused to political organisers in bringing apathetic persons before the registering officer. The balance of advantage, however, seems to me to lie on the side of the Commissioners&apos; proposal. It would facilitate the process of compiling the Register, and there is something to be said for not forcing registration on persons whose interest in their voting rights is insufficient to induce them to apply.38. I have explained previously my reasons for not favouring a reduction in the number of constituencies contemplated by the Commissioners. As regards the division of country into electoral districts, I think that the best method would be to leave this to a non-political, quasi-judicial Commis-sion consisting of one, or possibly two Judges of the Supreme Court and the Director of Statistics. Such a Commission would visit the several provinces, take such evidence as it might think desirable and submit its recommenda-tions for ratification by the Governor. If, as is suggested in the Report, the Commission were allowed a reasonable latitude in varying according to local conditions the standard quota within the limits of a prescribed maximum percentage, there would be no need to fetter its discretion by any such specific instruction as is advocated in the relevant Resolution of the Unofficial Members. Provision for the appointment of such Commissions, and the readjustment by them of the delimitation of electoral districts, at stated intervals perhaps of ten years might be made in the Constitution. It would be unnecessary in that event to insert in the constitutional instrument a list and discription of the first apportionment of electoral districts. The Governors ratification, if he were duly empowered in that behalf, would suffice to give validity to the recommendations of the successive Commissions. The arrangements for delimitation in the Union of South Africa might be a convenient model for adaptation. Its great-advantage would be the total exclusion of politics from the process of redistribution.39. The cardinal point of difference betwteen the Constitution recommended by the Commissioners and Constitutions of a more usual type is inherent in the proposed system of standing Executive Committees of the State Council. The Committee System is fundamental to the whole scheme of government presented in the Report, and is its distinctive feature. A. Constitution from which the Committee System had been eliminated might be a better Constitution than that devised by the Commissioners, or it might be a worse Constitution, but it would certainly be an utterly different Constitution. The elimination of the Committee System would be, if I may quote the&apos;words of your telegram, &quot;an amendment in principle which would destroy the balance of the scheme.&quot; Your telegram had not, however, been despatched when the Unofficial Members, by the large majority of 23 votes to 8, adopted the motion that the Committee System was &quot;not suited to local conditions&quot; and was &quot;unacceptable to the people,&quot; and they may not have appreciated that such a decision, if maintained, would be equivalent in effect to a categorical rejection of the whole of the Commissioners&apos; scheme. I doubt whether among the people at large there is any strong feeling for or against the Committee System. Their interest would seem to have been focussed rather on the franchise question as more easily intelligible and of more immediate concern to themselves, and it is not improbable that otherwise their consideration of the Commissioners&apos; constitutional scheme has been concentrated mainly on such of its broader implications as the extension of self-government and the advent of Ceylonese Ministers. In political and official circles, however, the Committee System has been keenly canvassed, and I cannot honestly say that it has found any largo measure of favour on its own merits, though it has some ardent supporters.
Most of the objections to it and of the difficulties and disadvantages which from various points of view it is thought to involve have been set forth in the speeches of Unofficial Members on the motions dealing with it. I do not propose to recapitulate them here, but summarized in the most general terms the principal criticisms passed on the system within and without the Legislative Council may be said to take excepfon to it either as unworkable or as likely to cause undue delay in the transaction of business, or as derogatory to the status and incompatible with the proper functions of a Minister, or as embarrassing to Heads of Departments in the discharge of their duties and in their relations with Ministers, or as conducive to the substitution of compromises and bargains for a clearly defined policy, or as unjustifiably expensive, or as a check upon the development of a full sense of responsibility, or as an impediment to further constitutional evolution towards the desired goal.40. The proposal to vest administrative as well as legislative functions in the State Council, which I take to be, like the Committee System, an essential ingredient of the Commissioners&apos; scheme, has not evoked opposition comparable in volume or intensity. Indeed I should hesitate to conclude that there was any widespread reluctance to accept it. And yet, the Committee System is so closely interwoven with it as to be, for all practical purposes, an inseparable corollary, for it is impossible to conceive how so large a body as the State Council could attempt to conduct administration without the assistance of Standing Committees. Some of the unpopularity of the Committee System, in political circles at any rate, is due to a dislike of the arrangement by which the selection of Ministers (other than the Officers of State) would be assigned to the Committees. A suggestion was submitted to me very tentatively that, instead of the whole State Council apportioning its members by ballot to the several Committees and leaving it to each of the Committees to choose a Minister, the whole Council should elect the seven Ministers and leave it to them to appoint the members of their Committees by mutual agreement among themselves. It was urged that Ministers thus elected would have, individually and collectively, a reasonable assurance of support by a majority of the whole Council in Legislative or Executive Session, whereas a Minister chosen by a Committee might be exposed to the risk of insufficient support outside his own Committee Room. The suggestion involves a considerable variation of the Commissioners&apos; scheme. It would change the Board of Ministers into something closely resembling a Cabinet of the normal type, and it would relegate the Executive Committees to a comparatively insignificant political role. The suggestion was favoured by a few, but was not generally regarded as an amendment desirable in itself or likely to make the Com-mittee System more acceptable, and I should not feel justified in recom-mending its adoption. -41. If I looked upon the Committee System as unworkable, I obviously could not advise you to proceed further with a constitutional scheme of which that system is an integral and essential part. In my opinion, the Committee System is an experiment which, if it proved successful, might be expected to remove many of the difficulties arising out of our local conditions. It would not be a very easy system to &quot; work &quot;, especially at the outset when there would be few, if any, fully applicable precedents to guide us. There are several points on which the manner of its working cannot be visualized clearly in advance of actual experience. I could not guarantee success, but I consider that, with a spirit of mutual good-will and co-operation among those principally concerned, the system would be capable of successful working, and that its advantages, in the event of successful working, would be such that, even at some risk of possible failure, it should be given a trial.42. In spite of the manifestations of opposition to the Committee System, I see no reason to doubt that, if a Constitution of which it formed part were accepted, the general disposition would be to co-operate in an
endeavour to &quot; work &quot; the system successfully. I should-xot anticipate that, if it were to fail, its failure would have been induced by any wrecking tactics. Nor do I think that the objections to it which were ventilated in the Legislative Council would now be pressed to the extent of causing the rejection of an offer of the Commissioners&apos; scheme as a whole, if the franchise proposals were made acceptable to a majority of the Unofficial Members. It would be fair, however, to recognize that diffidence in regard to the Committee System had been strongly felt and emphatically expressed, and that an eventual failure of a genuine attempt to overcome its difficulties would not necessarily imply unfitness for self-government.43. I do not, however, pjredict failure. The adjustment of relations between the Committee, the Minister and the Head of the Department respectively need not in practice present a problem of much greater com-complexity than is presented in the affairs of a Public Company by the adjust-ment of relations between the Directors, the Chairman and the General Manager. I do not conceive that a Committee would expect at any rate for long to be consulted by the Minister on every point and at every stage of every matter with which he had occasion to deal, before he took am&apos; action. That would involve almost daily meetings of the Committee throughout the year, an obvious impossibility as a permanent arrangement. The Minister, having been selected by the Committee as its Chairman and exercising Ministerial functions in virtue of that Chairmanship, would be entitled to presume that the members of the Committee, or at least the majority of them, would repose some confidence in his judgment and discretion, and he would soon acquire the kind of instinct which would enable him to foresee what matters the Committee would wish to discuss orally, what matters it would desire to have submitted by the circulation of papers, and what matters it would be prepared to leave to him for disposal with the Head of the Department in reliance upon its subsequent confirmation of his action if such confirmation should be necessary. Some Committees, no doubt, would be more exacting than othei-s, but I postulate for all of them an allowance of reasonableness not less than would be requisite for the working of any system dependent on mutual accommoda-tion.44. There is one point of detail on which the Commissioners&apos; scheme in regard to the Committees seem to me to need further consideration. I refer to the proposal that the division of the members of the State Council into the seven Standing Committees should be effected by secret ballot of the whole Council. This, I fear, would not be a very satisfactory process. Such members as might aspire to ministerial office could hardly be expected to refrain from preliminary steps designed not only to secure their own election to particular Committees but also to arrange that those particular Com-mittees were so manned as to promote their prospects of selection for the Chairmanship. There might indeed be a risk that a group temporarily commanding a majority in the Council would function as a kind of caucus and apportion ail the members of the Council among the several Committees in accordance with some preconcerted plan. A majority which might not possess sufficient cohesion to act together as a party for any length of time might nevertheless, especially if communal feeling happened to be running high, be prepared to co-operate at the beginning of the life of a Council&apos; to the extent of assuming the power of exercising effective control in every one of the Committees and thus determining the selection of every Chairman. I take the intention of the Commissioners to have been that the Committees should not be the instruments of a party caucus or a communal caucus, and with a view to guarding against such a contingency, I would suggest the following atternative method of constituting the Committees :-If, apart from the Officers of State, the Council consisted of 77 Members (65 elected and 12 nominated), the membership of each of the seven Committees would be eleven in number. As soon as the elections and nominations had been completed, every member of the Council
would be invited to signify on which Committee he wished to serve. If for any Committee the number of applicants exceeded eleven, the names of so many as constituted such excess would be taken out by lot and placed in a pool. The names in this pool would then be apportioned, again by lot, among those Committees for which the number of applicants had fallen short of eleven. A week or so would then be allowed during which jnembers would be at liberty to effect exchange from one Committee to another by mutual agreement. When the Committees had thus been constituted they w&apos;ould proceed to the selection of their Chairmen. Any Committee would be entitled, if it so desired, to select (by secret ballot) its its Chairman a member of some other Committee. In that event, the name of one of the members of the Committee which had exercised this option would be drawn by lot for transfer to the Committee from which a member had thus been selected. Subsequent exchanges of members from one Com-mittee to another would be subject to tho ratification of the whole Council as well as to mutual agreement. The plan which I have suggested would, I think, tend to remove some of the apprehensions of the Minority Com-munities and to provide, so far as possible, the equality of opportunity which the Committee System, as I understand its purpose, was devised to secure.45. I should not wish to whittle away the functions and powers of the Committees in their relationship to the functions and powers of the Ministers by making the former little more than advisory to the latter, but I think that difficulties might arise if a Minister, in presenting to the whole Council a report of his Committee &quot;with which he might not agree, were not at liberty to record his dissent in some such formal manner as by the attachment of a rider to the report. Otherwise it might not be certain that the issue would be defined clearly. It seems desirable that the whole Council, in deciding whether to accept, or to reject, or to refer back the Committee&apos;s report should have an opportunity to exercise some mediatory influence, even though the Commissioners&apos; scheme would not appear to permit of the whole Council accepting the Ministers rider in lieu of the Committee&apos;s majority report. Probably, if a clearly defined difference of opinion between a Minister and his Committee were thrashed out in the whole Council and then referred back, the way might have been paved for the subsequent adjustment of the difference in the Committee room.46. As regards the grouping of Departments under the several Com-mittees, I agree generally with the scheme of distribution suggested by the Commissioners, though I think that some few modifications of detail may be desirable. I have discussed this matter with tli3 Members of the Executive Council. We all felt that for the devolution of the functions now vested in the Colonial Secretary&apos;s Office, as well as for the decision of various points which must arise in or out of the process of grouping, it would be helpful, and indeed necessary, to enlist the advice of an independent expert from outside the Island, as local official opinion on such points would inevitably be affected b3&apos; usage and tradition evolved under a different order of things, and to some extent also by personal factors. I do not think that so large an amount of inter-departmental reorganisation and readjustment could be undertaken satisfactorily without some assistance from outside, and it would be convenient to discuss with such an expert a number of other administrative points incidental to the preparatory arrangements for the new Constitution. I do not, however, contemplate the reference to him of such quasi-political questions as whether the Police and the Ports and Harbours respectively should be placed under one of the seven political Ministers or under an Officer of State. The Executive Council and I are agreed that it would not be expedient to reverse the considered recommendation of the Commissioners that both Police and Ports and ITarbours should be placed under Ministers other than Officers of State. Whatever might have been the position if the Commissioners had made a different recommendation, I am satisfied that there is no
necessity to reverse the recommendation which they have made, and that such reversal would create misunderstandings and give rise to difficulties greater than any which need be apprehended from adherence to the Commissioners&apos; recommendation. On the other hand, it is obviously important that the management of such a Port as that of Colombo should be conducted on sound business lines and should not be brought into the political arena. I am considering with my advisers the expediency of constituting something in the nature of a Port Trust which, although representative of all interests, Ceylonese as well as European, governmental as well as commercial, and although placed under one of the seven Ministers would be a non-political organism. The necessary information as to the working of such Trusts elsewhere is still being collected and collated, and I am not yet in a position to express any definite opinion beyond saying that the establishment of a Port Trust, if desirable and feasible at all, would be no less desirable and feasible under our present Constitution than under that recommended by tho Commissioners. Such a Trust could not, of course, be established without legislation, and I would consult you further before causing such legislation to be introduced.47. One of the points which I should like to submit to the expert referred to above would be the determination of a formula defining tho functions to be exercised by the proposed permanent official Secretaries to the Ministers. It would be unfortunate if, in practice, such a Secretary were to assume, in relation to the Heads of his Ministers Departments, the role of Head of. a super-Department, or of an intermediary between the Minister and the Departments. If the fullest j^possible co-operation is to be secured, it will be essential that the Minister should be in direct touch with the Heads of his Departments and should discuss matters with them personally as well as on paper. The Executive Committee and the Minister would require a small Secretariat of their own, and the officer in charge of it should be &quot; permanent &quot; and in other respects also of the type suggested by the Commissioners, but as between the Minister and the Heads of the Departments under tho Minister, the permanent official Secretary&apos;s functions should not, I think, greatly exceed those of an official Private Secretary.48. The lot of- a Minister would be anything but easy and unexacting, and I think it very questionable whether the Unofficial Members were well-advised in adopting a motion to reduce by one-third -that is to say from  1,800 to  1,200 per annum the salaries recommended by the Commissioners for Ministers and-the Sj^eaker of the State Council. I am anxious that there should be no wasteful expenditure, but apart from generally applicable arguments against under-payment of Ministers, it would be regrettable if the salaries offered here were not sufficient to make Ministerial office reasonably attractive in financial respects to persons of good earning-capacity. I should not have thought that a salary of  1,800 for a Minister would be considered excessive, having regard to the volume of the work which would come before him and to the difficulties with which he would have to contend. This question might stand over for further consideration when the detailed provisions of the Constitutional instrument are being drafted. It might be desirable also to fix in that instrument the salaries of the Officers of State. In view of their responsibilities and of the special qualities desirable, I would suggest  2,400 as a minimum figure for the Attorney-General and the Treasurer under the new dispen-sation, and I should be disposed to continue to the Chief Secretary the salary of  3,000 now payable to tho Colonial Secretary.49. The Commissioners&apos; recommendation that the Governors j)Owers should be increased .must, I take it, be regarded as one of the essential features of their scheme. I presume that they would not have felt able to propose the sudden change from a narrowly circumscribed franchise to practically universal suffrage, the immediate abolition of elected communal
representation, and the transfer of executive authority and of the general control of initiative from the Governor to tho State Council, without the provision of a safeguard in reserve for utilization if the need should arise. It is clear that the Governors additional powers are intended rather to serve the purposes of precaution and reassurance than to be used as an ordinary incident in the business of administration and legislation. The proper conception of the Governors position under the new Constitution would seem to be that of a steadying, not a meddlesome or thwarting, factor. He would not seem to be expected to bring his reserve powers into action if he merely thought that a particular course which was being adopted -was not the most expedient or most judicious1 of all possible courses. It would be fatal, in my opinion, to the success of the Commis-sioners&apos; scheme as an advance in self-government, if the Governor used his powers, or allowed an impression to grow up that they might be used, in such a way as to relieve the Ministers or the State Council of responsibility for the consequences of their acts, or in- other words if he came to be looked upon as responsible for all the acts of Ministers and the Council which he had not prevented by the use of his special powers. The occasions on which his intervention would be obligatory are set out in the Eeport, and it would not usually be very difficult for him to determine whether some other occasion was one on which his intervention, in the exercise of his discretion, was called for. If Ministers would be prepared to give him their confidence and to consult with him as freely as Ministers under full Eesponsible Government usually consult with their Governor or Governor-General, it should seldom be necessary for him to have recourse to his overriding powers, and I see no reason to doubt that Ministers would be as anxious as he to preclude, so far as possible, any such necessity. It is true that he would not enjoy, as a matter of course, the same oppor-tunities of meeting Ministers collectively at regular intervals as are afforded under Ecsponsible Government institutions of the normal type by the periodical meetings of the Executive Council; with mutual good-will, however, there would be nothing to prevent the maintenance of close personal relations in a less formal but equally effective manner.50. I do not think that the Governor&apos;s special powers could be excised from the proposed Constitution, or be substantially modified, without dislocating the whole balance of the Commissioners scheme, and in any event, having regard to all the circumstances, it would not seem to me wise to make such an amendment. I am unable, therefore, to recommend that effect should be given to the relevant deprecatory Resolutions of the-Unofficial Members. But, while I feel it to be unavoidable that .the Governor should be vested with these sjiecial powers, I am far from supposing that the possession of them would enhance the amenities of his life. Until the distinction between the letter and the spirit of the Constitu-tion, and the bearing of the one upon the other, had begun to be generally understood, the Governor would probably be asked to interfere with every decision of the State Council or of an Executive Committee or Minister which happened to be distasteful to some individual or group. His refusal to act upon such an appeal would be ascribed by the appellants to pusill-animity or perversity or some other undesirable quality: his compliance would give rise to displeasure and adverse criticism in other quarters. He must expect, therefore, especially in the early days of the new Constitu-tion, to find himself almost continuously in a not very comfortable position. Although his duties need not prove as invidious as those which are to be assigned to the Treasurer, his task would be beset with some difficulties and embarrassments which neither Crown Colony Government proper nor full Eesponsible Government would entail. The new Constitution would deprive him of most of his power of initiative, the disappearance of the Executive Council would add to the isolation of his position, and owing co the virtually unlimited rights of interference which would be vested Tri him, the measure of his relief from his present burden of unconditioned responsibility would depend, not so much on any definite provision of the
Constitution, as on Constitutional usage, which at the beginning (subject to your superior authority) he would have to interpret for himself. In these circumstances he would be fortunate among Governors if he contrived to emerge from his term of office here under the new Constitution without some loss of credit and reputation. That, however, is a point of personal rather than public concern, and it: is not of sufficient importance to call for any modfication of the Commissioners&apos; scheme. There would be a set-off in the attractiveness of work carried on under conditions in which the creation of precedents would take the place of the usual following of precedents, and in the interest of co-operation in the task of making the new machinery function satisfactorily. Nor is there any reason to appre-hend that the difficulties confronting the Governor would be aggravated by any lack of friendliness or courtesy on the part of the people or its representatives.51.   Much of the criticism on the proposed additions to Article XIII. of. the Royal Instructions would seem to have arisen out of some misunder-standing of the intention and effect of that Article.   It has been misinter-preted as prohibiting the introduction into the State Council, or the passing by the Stale Council, of any measure falling within the categories specified in that Article..  It has also been misinterpreted as an instruction to the Governor to disallow any such measure upon its submission to him for assent. If it were generally understood that the Article was not an instruction to the Legislative (or State) Council, but that it merely imposed a limitation on the Governors exercise of his discretion, by requiring him to apply to such a Bill a process similar to that of reservation under the provisions of Article L. of the Ceylon (Legislative Council) Order-in-Council of 1928, and that simultaneously it relieved him of the obligation so to deal with the Bill if he had previously obtained His. Majesty&apos;s instructions upon it, or if it contained a clause suspending its operation until His Majesty&apos;s pleasure had been signified,  or if the Governor were satisfied that its immediate coming into operation were a matter of urgent necessity : and if it were further understood that reservation or its equivalent need not inevitably be followed by disallowance or even by any great delay in the signification of the final decision, whether favourable or adverse, I believe that the opposition to this particular item would be greatly reduced in volume and strength, though I do not suggest that it would disappear entirely.   No serious exception appears to be taken to the  Governors discretionary power to reserve any Bill whatsoever under the provisions of Article L. of the Order-in-Council, but there is a point of sentiment involved in the distinction between a decision taken locally by the Governor at his own discretion and a decision imposed on him by a standing instruction from without the Island.   I think, however, that the balance of advantage is on the side of the Commissioners&apos; rcommendation, particularly from the point of view of the reassurance of. communities or classes or interests actually or potentially disquieted by the proposed drastic changes in the Constitution.52. The Unofficial Members demurred by a very large majority to the proposal &quot; that the power to enact legislation should rest absolutely in &quot; the Governor himself and that no voting on a Bill be required.&quot; This * phraseology is taken from the Report, but it does not express quite correctly the intention of the relevant recommendation. The Commissioners did not contemplate that the power should be absolute, although they so describe it. It is clear from another passage that two conditions were to be attached to its exercise: the Council must have refused to co-operate, and the Governor must consider the subject-matter to be of paramount importance in the public interest. Substantially this would amount to nothing more than the continuance of a power now vested in the Governor, but some misapprehension may have been caused by the use of the term &quot; abso-lutely&quot;, and I do not myself understand how it could be known that the Council had refused (or would refuse) its co-operation, if the Bill were not
put to the vote. It would seem only right and proper that, save perhaps in a matter of the most urgent necessity, the Council should be given an opportunity of co-operating and that its eventual refusal should not be taken for granted before its attitude had adequately been tested and shown to be either negative or unduly dilatory.53. The Governors power to declare a state of emergency and on such declaration to take over the control of the Police and of other Departments would, I think, be regarded as less objectionable if it were derived from a local statute passed by the Legislative or State Council than if the Council had not participated in the grant of it. It is necessary that some such power should be available in reserve, and it is very desirable that it should rest on a statutory basis and not inevitably involve subsequent applications for indemnificatory legislation. Provided that the powers granted were adequate, I should prefer to derive them from a local enactment in which the elected representatives of the people had participated, and I would, suggest that, if and when an Emergency Powers Ordinance fully satis-factory to His Majesty&apos;s Government had been passed by the Council, the reference to emergency powers might disappear from the Instrument granting the Constitution. Any subsequent legislation amending or repeal-ing such an Ordinance should be brought under the provisions of Article XIII. of the Royal Instructions.54. No difficulty need be anticipated in respect of the Commissioners&apos; proposal that the correspondence between the Government of Ceylon and the Secretary of State should be conducted from the Governors office rather than from the Chief Secretary&apos;s. That method was followed in the Union of South Africa when I was Secretary to the Governor-General, and I can say in the light of personal experience that it proved quite satisfactory. For the purposes of this work the Governor would require an increase of his Secretarial and clerical staff and the provision of additional office accom-modation, but there should be a corresponding saving of expenditure on the Chief Secretary&apos;s office.55. Two powers not specifically mentioned in the Report should, in my opinion, be vested in the Governor. Fie should have the right of dissolving the State Council at any time. The absence of such a power might be found very inconvenient. I should see no objection to the right being limited by the requirement of your prior .consent to its exercise. The second power is that he should be entitled to call for any departmental papers which he might wish to see. Reference to the original documents is often very helpful to the study of a question, and if the Governor is to discharge with reasonable efficiency his proposed functions in,relation to the Executive Committees and the State Council, any papers for which he might ask should be made available to him. It may not be necessary to provide for this requirement in the Constitution. I am only concerned that no dispute should arise if and when the Governor had occasion to call for papers.56. The Commissioners very wisely have laid stress on the importance of giving a sense of security and contentment to our public servants (in which term I include, of course, the members of the Civil Service), and they have made various proposals to that end. I would preface my observations by expressing a hope that the new Constitution would contain a clause protecting all the existing and accruing rights of all public servants who were in office at the date of the commencement of the new Constitution. There are several precedents for such a clause in the Constitutional Instruments of Southern Africa.57. I am very strongly in favour of the establishment of a Public Services Commission, as proposed in the Report. The advice of such a permanently constituted Commission would be of great assistance in the conduct of administration, and I am confident that, in the light of practical experience, Ministers would not fail to appreciate its usefulness.
58. I feel some doubt, however, in regard to the recommendation that a Salaries Commission should be sent out from Great Britain. On grounds of principle it seems to me preferable that any general reassessment of salaries and other conditions of service should bo undertaken locally on the advice of a local Committee or Commission, partly because the task would be one of such intricacy that it could hardly be performed satis-factorily without a very full knowledge of local circumstances, and partly because the recommendations of an external body would encounter much greater opposition here than the recommendations of a judiciously consti-tuted local body. Personally I am in entire accord with the Commissioners&apos; advocacy of the so-called overseas allowance. I think it eminently reason-able, as well as desirable in the interests of economy, that the salaries of future entrants into the service should be fixed on a basic scale suitable to the needs of officers domiciled in Ceylon or in India, and that the unavoidably greater needs of officers domiciled elsewhere should be met by the grant to them of a supplementary pensionable allowance. But it would be most unfortunate if a principle so eminently fair and equitable in itself were to be misinterpreted here as an expression of racial bias or a form of racial discrimination, and I would urge therefore that it should not be introduced until local ojiinion is ready to accept it as fair and equitable. A change of this nature should not be imposed from without, lest the harm done by the -exacerbation of racial susceptibilities should outweigh in importance the benefit to economical administration which might be expected to flow from it. I believe that, before very long, public opinion here will be able to approach this question without the prejudice in which at present it would be enveloped. However that may be, I cannot advise you to refer tho question of a basic Ceylonese scale and an overseas allowance to a Commission from Great Britain at this juncture, and this attitude has the support of my Executive Council. A general revision of salaries is now under reference to a Select Committee of the Legislative Council which was appointed some time ago in compliance with a promise made by the Government when the last Salaries Scheme was adopted. The Committee has presented a Beport dealing exhaustively and on the whole, I should say, generously with the emoluments of the lower grades of the Service. That Beport has been submitted to you, and the Legislative Council will shortly be asked to ajoprove of the financial provision necessary for its adoption. I gather that the Committee&apos;s Beport in regard to the higher branches of the Service (including the Civil Service) is not unlikely to become available in the fairly near future. If its recommendations are satisfactory to the Government and to you, and if the Legislative Council is prepared to sanction the necessary financial provision for the adoption of these recommendations as well as those of the Beport dealing with the lower grades, there would be no occasion at present to invoke the advice of a Commission from Great Britain in respect of any such general revision of salaries. If, however, a satisfactory revision. of salaries and a satisfactory settlement of the question of the passage allowance should not be effected locally at a reasonably early date, I should feel constrained to ask you to take the appointment of a Salaries Commission from Great Britain, as a condition of the grant of the new Constitution, into further consideration. The ratio of recruitment as between Ceylonese and European officers is not a question which I should wish to see referred forthwith to a Commission from Great Britain. The process of &quot; Ceylonisation &quot; is still in a transitional stage, and any attempt to define a hard and fast rule would be premature as yet. I think that the development of the process might be left to the good sense of all concerned, subject to the proviso that any serious difficulty or disagreement which might arise should be referred to you for decisive adjustment. Any nocessary power which you might require for this purpose might, as the Commissioners suggosb, bo provided in the Constitutional Instrument.59. The Unofficial Members may bo regarded as having accepted &quot;in principle the Commissioners&apos; recommendation that officers who at&apos; the
time of the publication of the Report held, or had been recruited for, posts in the service, the filling of which was subject to your approval should be granted the right to retire on proportionate pension with compensation for loss of career, but the relevant Resolution dissents from the particulars of the recommendation on two important points. The Unofficial Members desire to exclude Geylonese officers from participation in this right and to limit the exercise of the option to a period of three years from the date of the inauguration of the State Council, whereas the Commissioners have proposed that the right should be applicable without any distinction of race, origin or domicile, and co-extensive in duration with the whole of the officer&apos;s future service. After careful consideration I feel unable to support either of these contentions of the Unofficial Members. It would seem to me unwarrantable to discriminate against Ceylonese officers in this matter. If, as is surmised, a Ceylonese officer would be less likely than a non-Ceylonese to find it difficult or irksome to adapt himself to the new order of things, he obviously would not elect to abandon his official career by exercising the right of premature retirement. If, however, the new conditions should be so unpalatable to him that he would rather retire than remain in the service, I can see no reason for withholding from him, merely because he happens to be a Ceylonese, the right of retirement con-ferred on his non-Ceylonese colleagues. I think it improbable that any large number of public servants, whether Ceylonese or non-Ceylonese, would elect to retire without giving the new conditions a fair trial, provided that the right of retirement remained open for use if the result of the trial proved disappointing, and my impression is that the longer the period of option might be, the fewer would be the premature retirements. As time went on, the conditions of premature retirement would grow less, attractive, since the ratio of the compensation payable for loss of career would, no doubt, vary proportionately with the prospect of service which was being surrender-ed. It is because I am anxious not to encourage early decisions to claim premature retirement, that I recommend the adoption of the Commissioners&apos; proposal as it stands.60. For the necessary reassurance of public servants it is of very great importance that their emoluments and pension rights (including the pension rights of their widows and orphans) and the prospects -and conditions of their service should not be liable to impairment or prejudice at the hands of the State Council acting of its own mere motion. The proposal of the Commissioners that the final decision in all such matters should be preserved to the Secretary of State has been widely understood here to mean that the State Council, though it would be afforded an opportunity of expressing its views, would be debarred from any effective control over these matters and their financial implications, so far as they related to the present and future holders of posts the filling of which was or would remain subject to the Secretary of State&apos;s approval; and that the Secretary of State&apos;s deci-sion, therefore, even though it might have been discordant with the representations submitted by the Council, must imply, in order to become operative, the exercise of a right to appropriate the necessary funds, no matter how large a portion of the public revenue might be involved. If this was the intention of the proposal, ft is intelligible that strong resistance to it should have been offered. In this context I might perhaps invite attention not only to the Resolution of the Unofficial Members expressing disapproval in terms, but also to the last of the Resolutions adopted by them &quot; that the present financial and other powers and privileges enjoyed &quot; by the Legislative Council of Ceylon should not in any way be abridged &quot; or taken away.&quot; If, however, the intention of the proposal was only that votes or Resolutions of the State Council or rulings of the Governor which affected the &quot; salary and emoluments, pensions and gratuities, &quot; prospects and conditions of service &quot; of tho officers in question, or the pensions and gratuities of widows and orphans, should be subject to con-firmation or disallowance by the Secretary of State, and that his decision
thereon should be final, then I do not think that any very serious objection need be apprehended. If it is contemplated that the Secretary of State should fix and amend salary scales and the other conditions of service without the concurrence of the State Council, and that, again without such concurrence, he should appropriate the necessary funds in that behalf, I doubt whether to any of the parties concerned this proposal could prove satisfactory in operation as a permanent arrangement. Unless the power were so considerately used as to have little practical value, I fear that much ill-feeling might be generated, and the proper co-ordination of the public service with other factors in the public life might be seriously retarded. As a temporary expedient for tiding over a transitory period of uncertainty, the proposal obviously would be far less objectionable, and it might remain in force until the various conditions affecting the public service had been defined and determined by an Ordinance acceptable to the Secretary of State. It would take some time to prepare such an Ordinance, but the task would not be one of insuperable difficulty. It has not been found impossible of achievement elsewhere. A subsequent Bill repealing such an Ordinance or an amending Bill whereby the rights or privileges of public servants might be prejudiced would come under the operation of the extended provisions of Article XIII. of the Royal Instructions, and those provisions could easily be made applicable also to any statutory Regulations under the Ordinance. The Secretary of State would presume-ably not accept the principal Ordinance or any Regulations made under it unless he were satisfied with their provisions, and until he had accepted the Ordinance, any special arrangement by which the final decision in matters affecting conditions of service had been preserved to him would remain operative for the protection of the interests of the public servants affected. I have not overlooked the arguments advanced against a Public Service Ordinance by the Commissioners, but with great deference I must frankly avow that they do not impress me as conclusive.61. Of the Commissioners&apos; recommendations in regard to local adminis-tration I must, I fear, say that, while I am in general agreement with them, they contemplate expenditure on a scale which Ceylon cannot afford at present and is not likely to be able to afford in the near future. I think it desirable that the Constitution should provide for the establishment of a Local Government Department on the lines suggested by the Commis-sioners, but in the staffing of that Department, and in the adoption of the schemes which it may elaborate and propound, we shall have to proceed cautiously within the limits of our financial resources. I need not discuss here the Commissioners&apos; proposals in any detail, as they relate mostly to matters which would have to be considered locally by Ministers and the State Council after the new Constitution had come into being, but I am fully conscious of their importance and of our obligation to the Commis-sioners for the very valuable guidance which we shall derive from them. I should not wish, however, to be understood as agreeing with the Com-missioners&apos; proposals for the supersession of the present Headman system, at any rate if they are intended to be immediately applicable to the whole Island. The employment of members of the Civil Service in the work now performed by Chief Headmen would be prohibitively expensive, and I am not at all sure that the alternative suggestion of a service of Headmen Cadets would yield advantages over the present system commensurate with the greatly increased cost which it would involve. The experiment might perhaps be tried in one or two of the politically, socially, and econo-mically advanced districts of the Low Country. In the Kandyan Provinces I should strongly deprecate for the present any departure from a system which, in spite of some obvious drawbacks, appears to be suited to the habits and customs as well as to the traditional loyalties of the Kandyan peasantry.
62. The Commissioners&apos; constitutional scheme could not, without the subversion of its fundamental principles, be adapted to meet the represen-tations which are summarized in the Report under the heading of the &quot;Kandyan Claim&quot;. In my remarks on the franchise question I have given such consideration as seemed possible to the risk to which the Kandyan villagers would be exposed of reduction to political insignificance in some of their own districts by Low Country Sinhalese and, in a lesser degree, by Ceylon Tamils if the literacy test were adopted, and by Indian estate-labourers if, in the absence of a literacy test, the requirement of permanent settlement were not enforced effectively. My suggestions as to the franchise were not, of course, governed exclusively or even primarily by this consideration, but it was one of the factors which were taken into account. Even if the substitution of a federal for a unitary form of government were compatible with the Commissioners&apos; scheme or politically feasible, which it is not, I should not feel able to recommend it. To my mind, the solution of the difficulty must be sought in the improvement and extension of educatiohal facilities in the Kandyan Provinces. Some little stimulus to Kandyan efforts in self-development might perhaps be given by administrative action, and the progressive evolution of Local Government institutions may be expected to open fresh avenues to a larger Kandyan participation in public life. The Commissioners&apos; proposal that occasional meetings of the State Council might be held at Kandy and Jaffna, while admirable in theory, seems to me to transcend the bounds of practical possibility, not only on account of the expense and inconvenience which would be entailed, but especially because in neither place could an adequate Council Chamber and the necessary Committee rooms and offices be provided in any available buildings, and further because, at Jaffna there are no hotels suitable for the accommodation of the non-resident members and the officers of the Council, and there is no reasonable prospect of such hotels being opened.63. The Resolution of the Unofficial Members deprecating the contin-continuance of the style of &quot; Honourable &quot; to Members of the Legislature might, I think, be accepted. In my opinion, it would suffice if, under the new Constitution, that title were granted only to the Officers of State, the Ministers, and the Judges of the Supreme Court, for local use during then-tenure of their respective offices. The question whether any of the persons now entitled to use it might be authorized to retain its use, and if so, subject to what conditions, would, no doubt, receive consideration.64. In the foregoing observations I have endeavoured to avoid reference to points of detail which are either uncontroversial or unlikely to affect the prospects of the acceptance or rejection of the Commissioners&apos; scheme. The eventual preparation of the draft Instruments for giving effect to the scheme, in the event of its acceptance, would afford a more convenient opportunity for the consideration of subsidiary detail. The modifications of the scheme which I have ventured to suggest are put forward in the hope that, if they commend themselves to you, they may serve in some respects to make the scheme more acceptable here and in other respects to facilitate its satisfactory operation. As I have previously explained, I cannot claim for any of them an assurance of support by any considerable majority of the Unofficial Members. I submit them solely on my own responsibility. I should not be understood to be expressing the views of the Executive Council, except where I have explicitly mentioned the Executive Council&apos;s concurrence.65. My recommendations as to the action which might now be taken are:  (1) that an offer of the Constitution pi^osed in the Report, subject to such modifications, if any, as in the light of -this despatch or otherwise you might think desirable, should be made, to the present Legislative Council ;
that the decision should be left to the Unofficial Members of tli^ Council, the Official Members being instructed to abstain from participation in the debate and in the voting, so that there might be no suggestion of the result having been affected by local official influence ;that the Unofficial Members be informed that an acceptance to which any qualification or condition were attached would be regarded by you as equivalent to rejection of the offer : this may seem arbitrary, but it is the only means of preventing the risk of a number of amendments being proposed, and of ensuring that the reply, whether affirmative or negative, would at any rate be definite ;that the life of the present Council which would normally expire by effiuxion of time on the 11th September, should be extended to the end of the calendar year : this would give time for a considered decision, and it would have the further advantage that the postponement of the General Election would enable it to be fought on an up-to-date register : if the Council were dissolved on the 11th September, the General Election would, under the provisions of Article LXIII of the Order-in-Council of 1923, have to be held before the 11th November : under the provisions of the Rules in Schedule I of the Order-in-Council the new register cannot come into operation before the 1st January next ;that, if the offer were rejected by the present Council, it should be resubmitted to the new Council which would be returned at the General Election early next year ;that you should not alter the present franchise before that General Election : the franchise question is the most con-tentious of all the issues involved in the proposed new Constitution : if the Constitution is rejected, its rejection will probably be due to apprehensions in regard to the franchise : although an extension of the- franchise is desirable, it would have to be extended so widely, if it were extended at all, that it would be inadvisable not to provide some concomitant safeguards, and this would entail the introduction of important Constitutional changes additional to the change in the franchise;that if the new Council also should reject the offer, the present Constitution should remain in force pending the reconsideration of the whole question : any suggestion that the rejection of the offer might have to be followed by some enlargement of the present powers of the Executive Government (which would be equivalent to some curtailment of the present powers of the Legislative Council) would be construed as a threat, and it is very desirable that, if the offer were accepted, no allegation should be possible that its acceptance had been forced on the Council by a threat ;that, if the present Council should accept the offer, its life should be extended by a further period of twelve months up to the end of 1930 : this would obviate the necessity of exposing the country to the expense, inconvenience and turmoil of two general elections in close succession : it would allow sufficient time for the completion of the arrangements preparatory to the commencement of the new Constitution, and if the allowance of time should prove excessive, the extended life of the present Council could be terminated before the end of 1930 by the use of the Governors general power of dissolution.
66. I am anxious that, if the new Constitution is accepted, it should be be accepted in the spirit in which I&quot; know that His Majesty&apos;s Government would offer it, as a token of mutual trust and good-will, given and received generously and freely. I believe, though I cannot be certain, that its acceptance is desired by a large majority of the people of the Island, and that a majority of the Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council will be ready to accept it, though not without some misgivings, if only the franchise question can bo settled to their reasonable satisfaction. But whether the new Constitution be accepted or rejected at this stage, the publication of the Commissioners&apos; Beport has had a profound effect on the development of political thought throughout the Island, and Lord Donoughmore and his colleagues need have no fear that they have laboured in vain. They have left behind them cordial and grateful memories. If proof of this were needed, there was abundant evidence in the recent manifestations of personal sorrow at the news of Sir Geoffrey Butler&apos;s death. I am confident that I am expressing a universal &apos; sentiment if I ask you to convey to the Commissioners the thanks of the people of Ceylon for the service which they have rendered to the cause of self-government in this Island.67. If you decide to publish this despatch, I shall be glad to be authorised to arrange for simultaneous publication here, as misconceptions might otherwise be caused by necessarily condensed telegraphic summaries.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient, humble Servant,H.   J.   STANLEY,Oovernor.
iJraft Despatch to the Governor of Ceylon.Sir, Downing Street, August    , 1929.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch of the 2nd June on the subject of the Report of the Special Commission on the Constitution of Ceylon. I appreciate the admirably complete and lucid exposition which you have given of the situation arising from the publication of the Report and the debates on the subject which took place in the Legislative Council.2. The situation created by the action of the Legislative Council in rejecting, by varying majorities, the main proposals of the Special Commission is a difficult one. The adoption of the scheme proposed by the Commission would involve novel and far-reaching changes in the constitutional machinery, and it is clear that the success of the proposals must depend largely on the goodwill with which they are approached by those who are likely to be mainly responsible for their execution. It would clearly not be expedient to attempt to inaugurate such changes in the scheme of government in opposition to the consensus of public opinion. At the same time it must be recognised &quot;that the present Council is elected by only a small fraction of the population, and if a marked cleavage of opinion showed itself in the Council, it would not be proper to allow a small majority in that body to stand indefinitely in the way of a practical constitutional advance.3. While I agree with you that the Special Commission may well be thought to have laid undue emphasis on the difficulties of working of the existing Constitu-tion, it will be recognised that the publication of the Report has made it more urgently necessary to consider the possible alternatives to that Constitution, which, in its essence, was only a temporary expedient designed as an advance in the direction of popular control over the administration.4. I had, therefore, to consider whether there was any practicable alternative to the adoption of the recommendations of the Special Commission.5. In this connection I agree with you in thinking that the irritation induced by some references to the Council in the Report may have tended to stiffen the opposition to proposals whose originality would have led, in any case, to their being regarded with some suspicion. However this may be, no other scheme which has been brought forward appears to have any chance of acceptance. A small majority of the elected members of the present Council have asked for the immediate grant of full responsible Government. The report of the Special Commission deals fully with the objections to the immediate grant of any such system of Government. I entirely accept the views expressed by the Special Commission on this point, and I think that, in face of their examination of the question and of the obvious objections to such a proposal, there is no prospect that His Majesty&apos;s Government could agree in the near future to the grant of full responsible government or Dominion status to Ceylon.6. Other possible constitutional changes were examined and rejected by the Special Commission. In the absence, therefore, of any other scheme which is both practicable and likely to be acceptable, the only alternatives were the adoption of the scheme of the Special Commission with such adaptations of its main principles as can properly be conceded to secure its acceptance by such important sections of opinion as are at present opposed to it, or the maintenance in force for a further period of the existing Constitution. The latter might have been a practicable course before the publication of the Report, but, in present circumstances, it would probably involve a continuance of agitation and an increasing difficulty in carrying on the Government.7. I consider, therefore, after prolonged and anxious consideration, that it is desirable that, subject to such adaptations as I shall indicate, the scheme of the Special Commission should be put into operation. Experience of its working alone can show what further detailed changes are desirable.8. The proposals of the Special Commission must be regarded as a whole, and I should be unwilling to accept any amendments which would destroy the balance of the scheme. There are, however, certain changes which appear to me, after con-sideration of your despatch and of representations which have reached me from
other quarters, to be desirable, either to secure a greater measure of acceptance for the scheme as a whole or to improve the prospects of its satisfactory working.9. In what follows I propose to deal with the scheme in its broad outlines. In the course of the preparation of the draft of an Order in Council, if agreement is reached on the general lines of such an Instrument, it will be possible to discuss detailed provisions in separate correspondence:10. The question of the franchise has involved more controversy than any other of the proposals of the Special Commission. I cannot fail to recognise that, unless some material modification of the proposals relating to the franchise can be announced, the prospect of general acceptance of the scheme and of active co-opera-tion in its working if it is put in force is remote. You have fully discussed in your despatch the main outlines of the controversy which has arisen, and in paragraph 35 you submit proposals for modification of the recommendations of the Commission which appear to me not unfair in themselves and to be likely to command a large measure of acceptance. I propose to adopt your suggestions under which, subject to special provision being made for British subjects not domiciled in Ceylon being allowed to qualify for the franchise in accordance with the conditions of the present Constitution, domicile should be the standard test for inclusion on the Register. The definition of &quot; domicile &quot; involves legal questions of much difficulty and complexity, and the qualification would hardly be suitable if it stood by itself. The difficulty would, however, be overcome by your proposal that the applicant, provided he can furnish satisfactory evidence of five years&apos; residence, should be qualified for the vote on the production of a certificate of permanent settlement granted by some duly appointed officer. I propose that provision should be made for this qualification in the.Order in Council.11. I accept the recommendations of the Special Commission that all separate communal representation should be abolished. The power of the Governor to nominate a limited number of Unofficial Members of the Council will be retained, but it will be understood that the Governor will be under no obligation to appoint representatives of those communities which do not secure adequate representation at the polls, but may use his power of appointment to secure, the presence in the Council of any individuals whose advice he considers specially valuable or who can speak for any important interest, not necessarily communal. It will be understood that members so nominated will be fully eligible for election as Chairmen of Com-mittees and appointment as Ministers. I agree that registration should be confined to those who formally apply for it. I accept your views as to the grant of the franchise to women on the same terms as for men. You will no doubt consider whether it is necessary, as you suggest, to make special arrangements for the recording of women&apos;s votes.12. As regards the numbers of the proposed State Council, I sympathise with the views expressed in the Debates in the Legislative Council as to the undesirability of creating a Council so large as to impose a heavy financial burden and hinder the rapid despatch of business; and while I recognise the force of the arguments in favour of a larger body, I would propose that the Council should be limited to fifty elected members with eight Nominated Unofficial Members and the three Officers of State. If experience shows that increase or decrease of these numbers is desirable the change can be effected without impairing the principles of the scheme.13. I propose to adopt the recommendations of the Special Commission for the administration of the Island under a system of Executive Committees with Chairmen holding the position of Ministers. The scheme is a novel one and its adoption is admittedly in the nature of an experiment. At the same time I think it is, in essence, well adapted to meet the special difficulties of Ceylon where, as the Special Commission points out, there is not only no immediate prospect of the appearance of a party system, but also there is a danger of the formation of groups based on racial or religious differences. The scheme proposed, while allowing due weight to the majority, will nevertheless secure that in all questions of administration the views of any important section will be able to secure a hearing.14. It will be recognised that the scheme represents a long step in the direction of popular control over the administration. In matters not specially reserved the Governor will normally act on the advice of Ministers. In regard to reserved subjects, which will, in practice, be confined to questions of defence, of external relations, of the interests of British subjects in other parts of the Empire, and of the rights of public servants, Ministers will have full liberty to examine and submit proposals, but the Governor will be free, subject to the approval of the Secretary
of State, either to reserve his consent, to impose conditions on his acceptance, or to refer the matter back for further consideration. As regards legislation, the assent of the Governor will be required before any law passed by the Council can take effect; and it will be provided as at present that the Governor may not assent to Bills of certain classes unless he shall have previously obtained the instructions of the Secretary of State on any such Bill, or unless the Bill shall contain a suspending clause. This provision will apply to Bills of the classes specified in the Report of the Special Commission, and in addition to any Bill the principle of which had evoked serious opposition by any racial, religious or other minority, and which in the opinion of the Governor was calculated to involve oppression or unfairness to any such minority.1.5. As regards the division of the Departments amongst the Committees, I accept generally the recommendations of the Special Commission.16. As regards the method of appointment of the Committees, I am not fully in accord with the proposals in paragraph 44 of your despatch, which would appear to leave too much to chance and to involve the risk that certain Committees might contain no members having any adequate support in the Council as a whole. The method of the appointment of Committees will be a matter for provision in the Stand-ing Orders and need not appear in the body of the Order in Council. The Standing Orders can be revised by the Council as experience shows to be necessary. I would suggest, in the first place, the inclusion in the Standing Orders of provisions some-what to the following effect. After the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker the Council should proceed immediately to form itself into seven Executive Committees with the functions defined in the Report of the Special Commission. In respect of each Committee each member of Council should be given a Nomination Paper on which he may nominate not more than three members to serve on that Committee. I suggest three instead of the full number of the Committee in order (a) to prevent the complete domination of all Committees by the majority in the Council, and (b) to reduce the inordinate labour of election. No debate should be allowed. Nomination Papers should be examined by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, and those members receiving the largest number of nominations if willing to serve should be declared elected. In the event of a tie the decision should be by lot. The Council should be adjourned for such period as the Speaker may decide, during which, members may, with the approval of the Speaker, exchange from one Committee to another. No member should serve on more than one Committee. If any vacancies remain to be filled they should be filled by the Speaker at his discretion. Such a plan would ensure that every Committee contains a number of members possessing the confidence of the majority of the full Council, while at the same time it would be possible for the minority communities to secure a reasonable representa-tion on all Committees. If, in the future, recognised parties come into existence in the Council, the method of nomination can be simplified, and probably the party whips will present agreed lists to the Council for acceptance.17. The question of the devolution of duties between Ministers,&apos; Executive Committees, and the Heads of Departments, is one of those which the Special Commission recommended should be worked out and embodied in General Orders, and I suggest that this matter should receive your consideration while the draft Order in Council is in preparation. I agree generally with the views which you express in paragraph 46 of your despatch. The relations between Ministers and their permanent Official Secretaries, to which you refer in paragraph 47, are also a matter to be worked out in General Orders.18. As regards paragraph 48 of your despatch, I should not propose to provide in the Order in Council for the actual salaries of Ministers, which would be fixed by the State Council. I agree, however, that it would be desirable to provide in the Order in Council for the salaries of the Officers of State.19. I agree generally with the views which you express in paragraphs 49-50 regarding the powers of the Governor. The Special Commission recommended the maintenance, with the necessary modifications in wording, of Clause 54 of the Order in Council, of 1923. Under this provision the Governor can only use his overriding powers after a declaration that the matter is one of paramount importance, and he must immediately report his action to the Secretary of State. I propose that the Clause should be retained as it stands with the omission of any reference to the Official Members, that is to say, after a declaration of paramount importance has been made by the Governor the Note or resolution to which it refers will be deemed to have been passed.
20. I agree generally with the views which you express m paragraph 53 of your despatch. As regards paragraph 55, I propose that the right of dissolving the Council should be retained in the new Order in Council. The Governor&apos;s right to call for documents could hardly be denied but can be expressly provided in the Order. As regards paragraphs 56 and 57 of your despatch, I propose to provide in the Order in Council for the vested rights of existing public officers and for the appointment of a Standing Public Services&apos;Commission.21. I accept your views with regard to the appointment of a Salaries Commission. I see no reason for sending another Salaries Commission to Ceylon at this stage, and I do not propose to make any provision to this effect in the Order in Council.22. As regards paragraph 60 of your despatch, I understand that the intention of the Special Commission was that Votes or Resolutions of the State Council, or rulings of the Governor, which affect the salaries and emoluments, pensions and gratuities, prospects and conditions of service of public Officers should be subject to confirmation or disallowance by the Secretary of State, whose decision thereon should be final, and I propose to make provision accordingly. I see no ground for insistence on a Public Service Ordinance.23. The recommendations of the Special Commission in regard to local Govern-ment raise complex questions, which only those with long experience of the traditional methods of rural and village communities in Ceylon can solve. Such questions are quite apart from questions of Central Government. I suggest that consideration of this section of the report of the Special Commission should be postponed. In any event, such matters are best left for discussion in the State Council.24. As you are aware, steps are being taken to issue an Order in Council extending the life of the existing Legislative Council until the end of 1930 unless it is previously dissolved. I request that this despatch may be laid before the Legislative Council. If the Council, on consideration, are prepared to accept my proposals, the drafting of the necessary Order in Council and other Instruments will be put in hand. In the meantime you should proceed, as indicated in the Report of the Special Commission, to appoint a Redistribution Commission which should submit recommendations for dividing the Island into the required number of electoral districts; to revise the General Orders so as to provide for the division of responsibilities between Ministers and Heads of Departments, and other correlated matters; and to appoint a Committee for the revision of the Standing Orders of the Council. If, on the other hand, the Legislative Council should maintain their opposition to the proposals of the Special Commission, the matter will require further consideration, and in that event it would probably be desirable for the Council to be dissolved and for a new Council to be elected under the existing Constitution.25. I propose that your despatch and this reply should be published simultaneously in Ceylon and in this country, and I shall be glad if you will inform me by telegram of the date on which it would be convenient to you to publish the correspondence in Ceylon.I have, &amp;c.o
