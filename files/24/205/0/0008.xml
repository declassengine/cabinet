NO, 207/29, as it gives an indication of some of the subjects which are likely to oome up for discussion, on the eoonomic side, at the next Imperial Conference,P.W, G.6th July, 1929.
Interim Report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Economic Questions In connection with the Imperial Conference.1.   The Standing Inter-departmental Committee on economic questions In connection Kith the Inperial Conference has been giving preliminary consideration to the matters which arise for examination In connection with the economic side of tne next Imperial Conference, and it appears desirable at this stage to make an interim report to Ministers.2.    Imperial Conferences In the past have sometimes been concerned on the economic as distinct from the political side with matters which though they may be Important are not very controversial or difficult and are mainly of a departmental or minor character, as In 1926.   On other occasions, however, such as the Conference of 1923, large questions of trade and economic policy have in addition arisen for discussion.   All the indications at present point to the probability that the forthcoming Conference will fall into the latter category. In 1923 the economic part of the work of the Conference was organised separately In an Economic Conference presided over by the President of the Board of Trade which was, however, held at the same time as the rest of the Conference and as an Integral part of it.    It is for consideration whether on the present occasion the Economic Agenda should not be separated from the Political Agenda and dealt with at a separate series of sessions.3,    The Committee are preparing for submission to Ministers In due course a detailed list of matters suggested for consideration by the next Conference on the economic side.   These will include reports of the work done by bodies of an inter-imperial character, such as the Imperial Economic and Shipping Committees, the Empire Marketing Board, and the Imperial Institute, oversea settlement questions; inter-Imperial co-operation In research? the economic aspects of
imperial air cotrrrauni cat ions, etc.   Most of these subjects in some of their aspects were also before the Conference of 1926. Explanatory notes are being prepared on the several items; and the statement already issued of action taken on the resolutions of the previous conference is being brought up to date.    The usual statistical and other reviews of the imperial trade position will also be prepared in due course,4.    The desirability is being explored of holding immediately before the Imperial Conference, to -Rfoich they would report, technical conferences upon three particular matters.   An enquiry has already been addressed to the Dominion Governments and the Government of India as to their views upon the holding of such a conference in regard to industrial standardisation, the importance of which was urged at the Imperial Conference of 1926. The time would also appear to be ripe for a further conference of statisticians from the various parts of the Empire to carry forward the work which was begun at a conference of Government statisticians held in 1920, and that which occupied the attention of the last Imperial Conference.    The present is an appropriate time as the statisticians will probably be needed in.any event during the Imperial Conference in connection with discussions on trade.    Finally,  it may be that a special meeting of workers engaged In the technical side of research work (other than agricultural research which is to be dealt with at a special conference due to meet again In 1932) in various parts of the Empire might usefully be held for an exchange of views upon certain branches of research work of an Inter-imperial character which is being carried on.    If these three sub-conferenses or any of them were decided upon and held, an attempt should be made to arrange for them to begin at such a date that their proceedings would terminate on the eve of the opening of the Imperial Conference which would have to  consider the results attained.5.    In pursuance of a decision of the last Imperial
Conference a Sub-conference Is being held in the coming Autumn, to consider the principles which should govern the practice and legislation relating to merchant shipping in the various parts of the Empire,    This matter arises out of the decisions reached in 19S6 regarding the constitutional relations &quot;between the self-governing parts of the Empire, hut as the practical application of its conclusions in regard to merchant shipping legislation Is primarily of economic import it may be thought that this matter should be included on the economic side of the Conference e60    In addition to the subjects mentioned above there are three matters in the economic sphere involving wide issues which are likely&quot;to take a prominent place in the discussions at the forthcoming Conference, and to which it already seems clear that special attention should be&apos; drawn5    The first and largest of these is the general question of closer co-operation between the various part3 of the Empire for the promotion of trade and industrial development0    The Prime Minister of Australia has publicly expressed the hope that   at the next Imperial Conference an effort will be made to grapple with the trade relations of the Empire, upon the basis that the Dominion should give to British goods an easier entry in cases in which Dominion manufacturers are not well-equipped to furnish the necessary supplies themselves to any large extent,    It Is understood that he would look to British capital and technical assistance for the development upon a sound basis in Australia of those industries for the    establishment of which Australia is ripe at the present time.    How far effect could be given to this expectation would depend upon the attitude of the several British industries affected.    It seems inevitable therefore, if this new policy materialises, that discussions should take place between United Kingdom and Australian business interests here and in Australia, or a series of discussions between limited groups as and when the suitable time arrived.
I50Assuming that this is. a correct outline of Mr. Bruce&apos;s ideas the natural course of events would seem to be first the exposition of his views at the Imperial Conference and afterwards the business discussions, though it seems not unlikely that the latter my start in certain directions before the Imperial Economic Conference.7.   The United States tariff policy also appears to be leading the Canadian Government to look at the stimulation of inter-imperial trade, and on this account also it would seem that trade matters are bound to assume prominence at the forth-coming Conference.8.   Much stress has recently been laid in public statements upon the desirability of discussions between representatives of the business interests of the various parts of the Empire,  and certain steps are already being taken.    It is stated that the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia are preparing for such a discussion in London and ?.j.r. Bruce is reported to have expressed his approval of tiie proposal.   The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has Invited members of the Parliament of this country to attend its annual convention in Alberta in September next,  and it is supposed that a number of Chambers of Commerce in Great Britain will be sending delegates.   The Association of British Chambers of Commerce in this country is drawing up proposals and suggestions for submission to the next Imperial Conference and the Chairman of the committee engaged upon this rork has suggested that such a programme should be prepared in collaboration between the main various Important industrial, trading and financial organisations in Great Britain, that aiimilar work should be undertaken in the Dominions,  and that then a meeting should be held in London before the Imperial Conference with a view to the preparation of an agreed programme by the representatives of business Interests in the various parts of the Empire.
9.   Generally speaking, however, though there is much talk of discussions between business men from different parts of the Empire there appears to be no generally accepted view as to whether such discussions should take the form of one conference or sectional conferences and whether they should precede or succeed tha Imperial Conference.    This is a matter which could perhaps be left for the moment to take its own course.    Anything that is done or being prepared now will at any rate serve to give an impulse to the movement towards co-operation.    It would seem, however, that any inter-imperial meeting of business representatives (which would presumably comprise representatives of commerce, shipping and industry including labour) would be most likely to have results of value if it were organised for group discussions or In separate conferences and had before it a programme carefully prepared after general ideas had &quot;been clarified by the discussions at the Imperial Conference.10.   The Standing Interdepartmental Committee are considering the preparation of a list of some economic factors Influencing inter-imperial trade and. they have in mind then the possibility of submitting brief memoranda on these factors in the hope that discussion of them at the Conference may lead to a more detailed consideration of them either by an Inter-imperial body designated for that purpose by the Conference or by such conferences   of business men as are referred to above, or by both.11,   A further matter which calls for consideration and may be raised by one or more of the Dominions from the point of view of the development of the organisation of inter-imperial relations on the economic side, relates to the position of the Imperial Economic Committee.    This Committee,   as will be recollected,  is a body composed of persons nominated by the various Governments represented in the Imperial Conference and responsible to those Governments, and was appointed as the result of a dis-cussion   at the Imperial Conference of 1923.    Its reference was limited to considering &quot;the possibility of improving the methods
of preparing for market and marketing within the United Kingdomthe food products of the overseas parts of the Empire, with aview to Increasing the consumption of such products in theUnited Kingdom in preference to imports from foreign countries,and to promote the interests both of producers and consumers.&quot;*t wihl he seen that the Terms of Reference were so drafted asto exclude the consideration of any tariff question. The ImperialConference of 1926 extended its reference so as to allow of theInclusion of raw materials and entrusted it also with thepreparation of brief preliminary surveys of the economic(including statistical) facts in relation to   .such branches of empire trade and marketing as might be agreed upxm.   TheCommittee will shortly&apos; complete the most important part of thework that strictly falls within its present Terms of Reference.12.    in this connection it may be recalled that the imperial shipping Committee, which was established as a result of theImperial Conference of 1918 with a constitution similar to thatof the Economic Committee, has much wider Terms of R-reference andis empowered to consider any matters concerning inter-imperial shipping and the material facilities for marttine transportbetween tho parts of the Empire that are referred to it by theGovernments of the parts of the Empire concerned.   The imperial shipping Committee has been at work for the last nine years andhas given satisfaction to the various Governments of tho Empire,a number of 7/hom, including Canada, have referred matters to its consideration.   The original proposal with regard to theEconomic Committee put forward by iir. Bruce in 1923 was thaftheImperial Economic Committee should be the complement of theImperial Shipping Committee and that &quot;the function of theCommittee should be to consider and advise   upon any matters ofan economic or cortfineroial character, not being mattersappropriate to be dealt with by the Imperial Shipping Committee,which are referred to it by any of the constituent Governments,provided that no question which has  any reference to another-6-
part of the Empire may be referred to the Comrai-ttee- irtthout the consent of that other part of the Empire&quot;. The Canadian Government, however, would at that time only agree to the appointment of an ad hop Committee with the limited terms of reference mentioned in the previous paragraph, and they adopted a^llke attitude in 1926,    It is possible that as part, of the movement towards the development of inter-Imperial trade the Canadian Government might now be prepared to consider an enlargement of the Economic Committee^ Terms of Reference, although^ no doubt it would be desirable that all questions of tariffs should still be excluded from iheir consideration. An Imperial Committee of this kind, which might Include permanent representatives of this country and the various Dominions and ad hoc members added for special purposes from time to time, might prove to be of considerable value not only in reporting on specific questions referred to it by one Government or another, but also in engaging In systematic and continuous economic research Into the factors which influence trade within the Empire.   The question is almost certain to come up at the Conference in connection with the report on the work done by the Economic Committee.13.    Should the Terms of Reference of the Imperial Economic Committee be extended in this manner, it would appear to be a body to which the questions referred to in para. 10 above might suitably be remitted by the Imperial Conference for subsequent co^s consideration.14.    Alongside the Imperial Economic Committee there is the Empire Marketing Board, established to promote the marketing in this country of Empire products.    It is financed by H.M.Government in Great Britain, but Includes representatives of other parts of the Empire,   The work of this body appears to have given general satisfaction to the other parts of the Empire, but suggestions have not unnaturally been made In various quarters that similar steps for the encouragement of
British exports of manufactured goods to the Dominions would also he of value.    The work of the Marketing Board falls under the headings of scientific research, economic investigation, and publicity.    The first is already provided for in most of the Dominions while the existing Marketing Board makes grants for research all over the Empire.   The question may, however, be raised whether, as the natural complement of the Marketing Board in this country, and as part of the machinery for carrying out a policy of encouraging inter-Imperial trade, somewhat similar bodie s raight not usefully be set up in the various Dominions to undertake publicity in those Dominions, in relation to Empire trade, local products being placed first, and generally to consider the promotion of such trade and the removal of avoidable impediments. Any such Dominion Marketing Board would, of course,  require to be established by the Government of the Dominion In which it was to operate and to be financed by that Government, although it would, like the Board in this country, include representatives of the other parts of the Empire,   A proposal of this kind would hardly come from His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, but it is not Impossible that it might arise in the course of consideration of the machinery for giving effect to any general policy   that may be agreed upon, and it would be desirable that the Government in this country should be prepared with a considered view as to the suitability of this or any possible alternative procedure,15.    It seems certain that from some source or another the problem will be raised of securing if possible, an assured market in the United Kingdom for oversea commodities.    Proposals may be made with reference to some staple commodities, or it may be suggested that an attempt should be made experlmen-tally to organise the channels of trade In some single commodity of limited importance, such as dried fruit or canned fruit,
with this object in view. The Inter-departmental Committee is considering the preparation of memoranda on some aapeots of the problem.16,    In addition to the Memoranda that will he prepared departmentally either for the Conference as a whole or conffdentially for Ministers, it may be found   desirable to provide for further documentation in the form of monographs on particular subjects that have a bearing on inter-imperial trade. The matter is   being explored by the Inter-Departmental Committee, and if it seems to them that a case Is made out for specific documentation of this kind proposals will be submitted,17 *   As indicated in paragraph 3 above, the Inter-departmental Committee propose   in due course to submit their definite recommendations as to the economic subjects which should be proposed by His !Iajesty!s Government in Great Britain for inclusion in the Agenda of the Imperial Conference,    In the meantime, however, thoy venture to set down the following tentative sketch of a programme as a general indication of the chief economic matters with which it may be anticipated the Conference will be called upon to deal: -Tentative Sketch of a Programme for the Economic Side of the Imperial Conference.I. Promotion of Inter-Imperial Trade.   .The reports of the Imperial Economic Committee and of the Empire Marketing Board would be before the Conference.Discussion would no doubt arise on one or more of the following items: -1. Proposals made by Mr. Bruce or the representativea of siy other part of the Empire for closer Oo-operation in the promotion of trade and industrial development.2, Economic Factors influencing inter-imperial trade not covered by such proposals.3. Methods of giving effect to the conclusions reached . In this connection proposals may be made with reference to:-(a) Future work of the Imperial Economic
Committee and possible extension of it3 functions;(b) Extension of work of the Empire &quot;Marketing Board and possible establishment In other parts of the Empire of bodies more or less analogous to it.(o) meetings of business representatives from different ^parts of the Empire;II. Transport and Communications,_Under this heading fall  s. u ch . matters as the following on which reports will be presented:-I. The work of the Imperial Shipping Committee;2. Matters arising from the forthcoming conference on merchant shipping legislation.3. Imperial air communications.4. The work of the Oversea Laechanlcal TransportDirecting Committee in regard to transport in less developed regions.III. Oversea Settlement.IV&quot;, Research, Statistics and Technique. *There may be three sub-Conferences immediately before the Imperial Conference on (a) Standardisation; (b) Statistics;  (c) Research in two or three fields of importance to Empire development or trade.    In this event three Items will be the following;-1, Report of suggested conference of-research workers.2. Report of conference on industrial standardisation.3, Report of conference of Empire statisticians.Among other subjects under this heading will be;-4. Agricultural research with particular reference to the Imperial Agricultural Research Conference proposed to be held in 1932.V, Mis oelianeous.Certain other proposals which do not fall under the above headings may b? raised, for instance there may be something to discuss arising out of tha arrangements for the avoidance of double taxation.Signed for the Committee, S. J.CHAPMAN.Chairman.
