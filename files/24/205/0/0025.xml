&quot;    164THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.    -       - Copy No. &quot;   &quot;jCABINET. C.P.225(29). &quot;APPOINTMENT AND STATUS OF CLERKS OF THE PEACE AND CLERKS OF THE COUNTY COUNCIL.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.1. The present position in thiB matter is not satisfactory.The Clerk of the Peace in counties is appointed &quot;by the Standing Joint Committee for the county and automatically becomes Clerk of the County Council.     The Standing Joint Committee is composed of an equal number of representatives of the County Council and of Qaurter Sessions.     The Clerk holds a freehold office.     His salary is fixed by the Standing Joint Committee and has to include remuneration not only for his own personal services but also for any staff which he may require for carrying out his duties.Protests have been received against the present position (including one from the Glamorgan County Council, for which a new Clerk had recently to be appointed).The County Council^ Association and the Society of Clerks of the Peace.have been negotiating for some time on the subject, and have reached agreement.     In order to avoid subsequent drafting difficulties in Parliament,  the late Minister of Health agreed that Parliamentary Counsel should assist in the drafting of the necessary Bill.     Later, in March last, after representations from the County Councils&apos; Association,  the Minister of Health wrote to them stating &quot;......... if the Government are returned to power and are assured that the Bill will receive the full and active support of the County Counoils*Association,  they willbe prepared either to adopt and introduce it as an agreed1.
measure, subject to the general exigencies of public business, or to give facilities for its passage, as may be found most convenient.&quot;2. The present position under which the offioersconcerned are appointed primarily as Clerks to the Peace and automatically become Clerks to the County Council is wholly out of relation with the position which exists to-day.     The growth in the range and importance of the work of County Councils is well known, and there will be a further great development of that work under the Local Government Act, 1929, There is no chance of putting right the position in regard to the appointment of Clerk to the County Council except by implementing the agreement which has been reached between the County Councils Association and the Clerks of the Peace, I anticipate little,  if any opposition to such a Bill.   The matters on which opposition might possibly arise are the following(1)    Some persons might consider that County councils should have full control over their clerks.   In the Bill it is proposed that there shall be a right of - appeal to the Minister of Health,  if a Council proposes to dismiss its Clerk:    there are, of course, precedents for thi3 course in regard to Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors.(2)    The proposed terms of retirement for present Clerks are favourable.     Broadly,  they are to receive the ordinary superannuation terms without having made any contributions.As regards both matters it must be remembered that &apos; the Clerks will be giving up their freehold office, and that the Bill will be a bargain between the two principal parties.
I suggest that the County Councils&apos; Association should he informed that if they arrange for the introduction of the Bill,  the Government will he prepared to give it facilities. It would he made clear that the Bill may have to he dropped if it should meet with material opposition.     The Home Office concur in this course.A.G.22nd July,  1929.
