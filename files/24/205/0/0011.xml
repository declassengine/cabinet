THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.ECRET. COPY NO.     39. P. 211 (29) -CABINET. TRADE OUTLOOK. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the Information of the Cabinet, minutes of the July meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council, together with notes in writing which I have received from members who were not present.The reports on coal, iron and steel, and engineering (general, marine and electrical) are, generally speaking, satisfactory for the time of year.    The motor trade appears to be recovering somewhat from the set-back reported round about Election time.This is not a busy period In the cotton trade, and at present It Is also suffering In consequence of tightness of money among buyers abroad, uncertain crop reports and the possibility of industrial trouble.    The Woollen trade In the West Riding remains dull; some classes of hosiery and lace are doing well.Retail trade by the Co-operative Societies in June has shown a satisfactory Increase over that of June, 1928; busine by the big Stores has probably just maintained last year&apos;s level.W.

NEXT MEETING.The next meeting is to be held on the second Wednesday in September, - September llth - at 10 a.m.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.THE PRESIDENT observed that, as the members of the Council T/ere no doubt aware, preparations for an Imperial Conference had now to be made.     These preparations must be put in hand as long aa possible beforehand, and he would welcome any suggestions that any member of the Advisory Council could make for that purpose on any aspect of inter-Imperial trade, or indeed on any subject which appeared to be of Importance for a Conference of that kind.COAL.MR. WARHAM wrote&quot;The weekly output of coal in the United Kingdom for the three weeks ended June 15th was as under:?week ended June 1st     -     4,904,000 tons &quot;       &quot; &quot;   8th     -     5,014,000     &quot;&quot;        &quot; &quot; 15th     -      5,047,000      &quot;The average weekly output for the eight weeks ended June 15th was 4,812,000 tons,  (it should be remembered that this is a holiday period), which is equal to 87$ of the 1913 average weekly output.&quot;The number of persons employed In the industry for the week ended June 15th was 935,800 equal to 84.7?* of the 1913 figures. Unemployment for the month of May was 17.9$, as compared with 15.8% in April and 21.9  average of 1928.&quot;The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom in May was 5,135,993 tons, as compared with 4,555,413 tons last month and 4,281,751 tons in May last year.     These figures exclude Irish Free State.     The value per ton f.o.b. In May showed a slight decrease, being 15/il as compared with 16/l in April,&quot;As I mentioned last month, exports by sea from Poland are Increasing.     In May a new record was established, the quantities being 782,000 tons, as compared with 679,000 tons In April.   These figures show that the increased, export which we have secured is not at the expense of Poland, but in spite of the increased amount which is being exported from that country.     The exports of coal from the United Kingdom for the five months ended 31st May this year are up by three million tons as compared with the correspond-ing period last year.     I append a statement (No.l given below) showing the exports to certain destinations for the first five months of 1913, 1928 and 1929,
CONFIDENTIAL. GOAL  (OONTD.)&quot;With regard to the shortage of tonnage which I mentioned lastjaonth, the position has become accentuated.    I find that on April 18th this year the Russian Government had 35 steamers on time charter for 5/3 months.    Since then they have cnartered 54 more, and it is estimated that there are now about 150 steamers engaged in this way, which normally might have been engaged in trade with the United Kingdom.    This Is causing an extraordinary shortage of tonnage in the exporting districts, and collieries are having great difficulty in keeping -working; in fact, there has already been a certain amount of idle time. This shortage has had its effect on the freight market,  and I enclose a statement (No.  2 given below) showing freights ruling at the beginning of this year and now.      There is still a demand for coal from abroad, which will have to be satisfied when the freight position becomes normal&quot;.STATEMENT  (N0.1)  SHOWING QUANTITIES OF COAL EXPORTED FROM UNITED KINGDOM DURING FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF 1915,  1928and 1929 01915. 1928. 1029.Total. -&quot;-29,519,825        /20,252,049 /23,210.541Certain Destinations.	1,020,284	507,071	661,945Sweden...........	1,744,500	420,767	621,831	1,262,015	575,294	802,619	3,512,982	2,071,882	1,956,557	5,356,575	3,813,492	5,045,373	933,095	915,312	1,455,994Netherlands......	879,344	891,789	1,193,421	3,930,725	2,655,184	2,803,491	1,072,451	812,744	790,483	1,442,554	10 , 225	8,303-*Total Exports in 1928 and 1929 include ooal consigned to the Irish Free State - not so in 1913./The figvires of exports to &quot;certain destinations&quot; in 1923 and 1929 are not strictly comparable with those in 1913 because in the two later years they include, In some oases,  (i.e. Denmark, France, Netherlands and Italy exports to possessions of the countries as well .as to the countries themselves.

The scarcity of pig iron persisted and difficulty was being experienced in obtaining delivery of certain qualities.    Business in Cleveland iron had practically ceased, as manufacturers were booked up for months ahead and merchants1  stocks were very small, Efforts were being made, however, to overcome the shortage of raw materials,   Dorman Long and Company were re-starting their Kilton ironstone mine in Cleveland and other firms were putting into operation additional batteries of coke ovens, which would make possible the re-starting of other blast furnaces.    It was reported that two hematite furnaces were to be re-started at Middlesbrough almost immediately, and that the Seaton Car-ew iron works, which had been   idle for twO&apos; years, were likely to be re-started next month.    Production on the north east coast during June remained round about the same level as in May, and
conf idem: ial.&quot;     IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.) .the position of the order books at the end of the month showed no change,    Makers manufacturing shipbuilding materials took a favourable view of the next three months, but in other departments a general falling off in trade was feared, particularly in the market for constructional material, where new business was comirg forward rather slowly.    Selling prices showed no change, but the prices of raw material showed a tendency to harden, particularly in the case of fuel and scrap. There had been a further decline in the relative proportion of export as compared with home business.   Competition on the domestic market was keenj   Continental manufacturers were apparently becoming more active and it remained to be seen whether British manufacturers would be able to hold the ground gained during the past six months, in the event of any substan-tlal revival of Continental competition in this country.Prospects in Scotland were fairly satisfactory at the moment; the slight decline in production last month was expected to be only temporary, as order books were -aell filled. At the present time buyers were showing rather more activity, but this was attributable in part to the approach of the Glasgow Fair holidays, when the heavy industries cease production entirely.   The fact, however, that the stoppage this year was not to be of long duration indicated that there was a considerable volume of work in hand.   Export business showed Increased activity, but some falling off was reported in home orders, new business being difficult to obtain.   The shipyards on the Clyde were not regarding the future outlook with any great degree of confidence.   Prices of finished products remained the same, but the pig iron and scrap position, although rather easier than for some weeks past, was still causing a certain amount of apprehension] and, in view of the higher rates being asked, an advance in the prices of finished products was considered justifiable.   Foreign competition was reported to be not so keen.Midland manufacturers supplying constructional steel to the engineering trade reported that, although production in June was about the same as in May, prospects were not so favourable as in previous months.The demand for steel In South Wales remained unsatisfac-tory, largely 07/ing to the meagre demand from the sheet works, a number of which were entirely idle.    Important markets for , sheets remained over-stocked and there were heavy stocks in some works in this country.   The tinplate industry continued to work about 75$ of capacity,   Continental sheet bars were . being offered to Welsh tinplate works and sheet works at rather lower prices.    In the Sheffield district there was considerable, activity in basic billets and It was stated that the production of this material was at a higher level than at any previous periods acid steel billets were making little progress.It was of very great importance that Continental countries should not believe that the advent of a new Government meant that this country would continue to accept unrestricted free imports Irrespective of their effect on employment, for there was a growing tendency on the part of Continental countries to attempt to come to an agreement with Great Britain and the United States on this question.
NON-FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LYTTELTON wrote:-&quot;There is, ao far as we know, no marked improvement in the tinplate trade, although just recently tinplate makers have been buying increased quantities,    consumption of tin in other lines is steadily maintained.    The copper trade shows little change, and- consumers generally are still holding off.   In the Midlands there has been slightly more enquiry and there are some signs of a recovery.    A moderate demand for copper has been experienced in the North, but cable makers are still not taking up to their normal quantities.   The main demand for lead still comes from the cable trade, although in the South the battery makers appear to be doing a fair business.    Trade in lead in the North is being affected by slackness In the building trade.    Demand for spelter is still very disappointing in all centres, with the exception of a slight improvement in Birmingham.    This is largely due to the continued lack of Indian demand for semi-manufactured goods11 .ENGINEERING.SIR ERNEST PETTER thought the most pleasing features of the month of May were the further expanded output of steel, reaching for the month the considerable total of 840,000 tons, and the exceptionally good export figures for iron and steel and engineering products, and indeed for British manufactures as a whole.    It should be noted, however, that imports were also maintained at a relatively high level.    The export of iron and steel and manufactures thereof (443,000 tons) and the export of machinery (58,600 tons) in each case constituted a new post-war monthly record, even exceeding the pre-war monthly averages of the year 1913.    The previous best month as regards the export of machinery was November 1937. The cumulative total of machinery exports for the first five completed months of this year was 843,319 tons, the corresponding figure for last year being 238,971 tons.    The present total represented S&amp;.1% of 1913 level of exports. The total value of the exports of vehicles (locomotives, motors, ships etc.) for the five months ending May 31st was  22.96 millions, as compared with  17.46 millions and  14.22 millions in the corresponding periods of 1928 and 1937, respectively.    As illustrating the wonderful expansion in our locomotive export trade during the last two years,  the value of locomotives and parts exported in the five months was  2.28 millions in 1929,  2.16 millions in 1928, and  .99 millions in 1927.The percentage of unemployment in engineering showed a slight setback, attributable to the general engineering trad&quot;-. There was a considerable improvement as regards construction?! engineering employment.    As regards wholesale prices, while
ENGINEERING  (OONTD).the general index and also the index of coal prices fell appreciably in May, there was a hardening of iron and steel prices to some extent.    On the whole,  judging from the latest statistical evidence, it might be said that the industrial and trade position so far this year had been better maintained than in the immediately preceding years, when a decided slump, commencing in the early summer, had been the usual experience.    But very much depended upon development in the immediate future and it was, therefore, too early to predict that the present position would be maintained throughout the year.MR. RICHMOND wrote:-&quot;On the Clyde in June, 31 vessels were launched of 48,740 tons, which is a very good average month.    Tonnage for the half year is slightly less than for the same period in the previous year.    Few new contracts have been placed in May and June, and unless there is an early improvement in demand, the outlook for the winter will be poor.    The larger establishments especially are getting through their naval work;    the &quot;Shropshire&quot; built at 3eardmore&apos;s, Dalmuir, has now completed her trials;   her sister ship the &quot;Norfolk&quot; is fitting out;    Messrs.  Scotts&apos;  two Torpedo Boat Destroyers are now in the water, and Clydebank&apos;s Destroyers are also well on.    The advent of the &quot;Bremen&quot; the new German Atlantic Liner may stimulate the larger Liner companies to proceed with their building programme, and any contracts for vessels of this type will be very welcome in the district at the present time.&quot;On the north east coast,  the orders in hand are also being rapidly completed, and there is an absence of enquiry for ordinary plant tonnage, which provides the bulk of the work for the shops in this district.    In the first five months of the year, 27 vessels of 88,952 tons were launched,-as compared with 39 vessels of 149,259 tons in the corresponding period of 1928, a decrease of 12 vessels and 60,307 tons.   The prospects for the latter portion of the year are not as favourable as those at a corresponding period for 1928.    It is, however, encouraging that substantial contracts continue to be received for ship repairing work. The latest unemployment figures available indicate an improvement during May, and on account of the approach of the holiday periods, and the necessity for completing work rapidly, this improvement will probably continue.&quot;The wages conference between the Engineering and Allied Employers&apos; Federation and the various Trade Unions took place on Wednesday the 19th of June, when application for &amp;/- per week for time-workers, and a corresponding increase in piece-work prices was made. The conditions of the industry were fully discussed, but the employers found themselves unable to accede to the application. The matter has been referred back to the Executives of the various unions.&quot;General engineering in Scotland is somewhat patchy, but the prospects in locomotive construction are distinctly brighter, and several substantial orders have recently been received.   Machine &quot;tool makers continue busy, but the reports from structural iron workers are not so favourable&quot;.
ENGINEERING (CONTD).Continental and American, conditions in the Engineering industry,.SIR ERNEST PETTER mentioned that, following the discussion which took place at the last meeting of the Council, particularly on wages and hours of working (A.C. 201, pp.8-10 and 30-31), he had had prepared by the British Engineers&apos; Association a special report dealing with the Incidence in regard to Continental and American competition of wages, hours of working, cost of raw materials, and carriage, in general engineering.    The paper was too long to read to the Council, but he would hand it in.THE PRESIDENT said that he would be glad to read it and have it circulated to the members of the Council./The report is reproduced as an appendix to these minutes/^.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.SIR HUGO HIRST observed that at the last meeting he had spoken rather fully oh the state of the electrical industry, and needed only to remark today that the comparatively happy state of affairs on which he had reported was still continuing.MOTOR INDUSTRY.SIR WILLIAM MORRIS said that it might be remembered that he wrote a report for the last meeting of the Council, because he could not be there personally.    The report had been rather a bad one.    Since that tine things had, he thought, improved a little, but the motor trade generally was very slack at the present time.    So many people were waiting to know whether the duties on motors were coming off or not, that is to say they were waiting to know whether there was any reasonable chance of getting their oars cheaper.    If some statement could be made as to whether the duties were going to be taken off or not, the motor trade would be , considerably eased.    Apart from that, no manufacturer at the present moment knew what to do in the way of ordering materials for next season, and that would cause a lot of trouble all over the country.   He was not suggesting that the qLiestion as to duties should be settled one way or the other. He did not mind which way so long as he knevr.Otherwise he had nothing particular to say, except that they were all naturally doing their utmost to improve the condition of the motor trade, and he hoped that at the next meeting of the Council it would be possible to report some progress.    The depression had lasted since the beginning of
MOTOR INDUSTRY (OONTD).the talk about the Election.    It would be about two months before the Election.    Since then, as he had said, things had improved, but the vhole of the motor trade was very slack.ME. WALKER observed that he was not connected with the motor trade in any way but he would ask whether it would not be a good thing if the Government could meet the motor manufacturers and discuss the whole position?   He knew that the motor trade did put to Mr. Churchill certain suggestions, that if he could transfer the tax from horse power to   petrol it would be of benefit to the motor trade.SIR WILLIAM MORRIS replied that that was a matter connected with the export trade.   The reason tfhy our export business in the motor trade was so poor was that we had had to build small engines in this country in view of the tax, while overseas they- all required a large engine.   What he asked Mr. Churchill to do was to take the whole of the horse power tax off and put the whole tax on petrol.    Everyone then would pay for what they used.    He was not suggesting a reduction in the tax.SIR HUGO HIRST remarked that the electrical industry, too, felt depression in those departments where they were linked up with the automobile industry.    Although some might think that duties were a good thing and some might think they were bad, we all agreed that uncertainty was bad for business, and he believed that the explanation which had been given in the House, that this question was not going to be dealt with until the nex.t Budget, was already in itself a palliative, and he ventured to think that that would be useful at any rate for the coming year and have a stabilising influence for the immediate future.SIR WILLIAM MORRIS asked whether that was a definite statement?   He did not think that the public regarded it as sufficiently definite.THE PRESIDENT explained that the motor car duties fell within the class of McKenna duties.      These of course were purely Budget matters, and were not like the Safeguarding duties.    He could say at once that there need be no doubt or hesitation on that point.   Whatever view we took of the McKenna duties, for or against, these duties would remain at least until the Budget of next year.    There would be no interference up to that time.   He could not of course say what the Chancellor might do then, but until that date the position would be as it was now.SIR WILLIAM MOitRIS asked whether the Government could make a definite statement on that point to the public?THE PRESIDENT observed that there must be a misunder-standing, because a most precise statement on that point had been made by the Chancellor on the previous day.    He had expressly said that these i.icKenna duties were Budget duties ana that no declaration v/ould be made regarding their future until the Budget of next year.
MOTOR INDUSTRY (OONTD.)SIR 0. HURCOMB wrote:-&quot;The numbe;- of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles) newly registered In May, 1929, was 2,028 greater than in the corresponding period of 1928,    Oars taxed on horse power increased by 4-15, goods vehicles by 1,725, and hackney vehicles by 143j    there was a decrease of 258 in &quot;other vehicles&quot;.    For the quarter ended 31st Hay,  1929, the total figures were higher than in any previous quarter since these statistics were instituted two years ago.   As regards motor cyclesj    there was very little change in the number newly registered in May, 1929, the increase being 73 compared with May, 1928&quot;.COTTON.SIR KENNETH STEWART stated that, from the merchant&apos;s point of view, the cotton trade for the month of June this year had been very poor indeed, even compared with the genere.l run of trade.    At this time of year it was never good, but orders from almost all markets were now very scarce.   This was to some extent due to very keen competition from other countries who were not having a particularly good time themselves.   Also there had been tightness of money in over-seas markets, owing to the almost continuous losses which dealers had made during the past few years;    this had resulted in merchants in most countries being inclined to use their resources in other directions than in dealing in piece goods. And then there was the local condition of uncertainty as to the future course of prices and also the uncertainty of delivery in view of the possibility of a stoppage in the spinning and weaving sections of the trade.   There were rumours on all sides of trouble with regard to the crops;    these, however, would be cleared up during the next two months, and, as the usual season for orders from India should then commence, there should be a revival about September,MR, LENNOX LEE observed that American cotton prices had sagged a little, owing to the reports of the cotton crop.      Egyptian cotton had fallen at least 2d. a pound, through the placing of large quantities on the market. There was great uncertainty throughout Lancashire arising from the notice to reduce wages given by the spinners and manufacturers.WOOL.SIR FREDERICK AYKROYD wrote&quot;The position in the West Riding shows no signs of improvement.    Confidence appears to have gone, and the markets have been falling for the past six weeks with no sign of any
WOOL (OONTD.)stability or- real basis.    It is a very significant fact that our cost of production is so high that we are now onlookers in the markets of the world rather than taking an active, prominent, and leading position as we used to do in by-gone xdaye.&quot;From the figures coming to hand, the wool season just closing reveals a record world&apos;s clip.    There is a substantial increase in Australia, the figures up to the end of June show a clip of 2,350,000 bales which is an increase of 190,000 or 8fa on last year.    In New&quot; Zealand there is an increase of 5fe,    In South Africa the exports to the middle of June are 816,000 bales, showing an increase of 7fo,&quot;To revert back to the year 1900 when the Australian clip was 750,000 bales, the machinery in the West Riding was fully employed because our economic position was sound and. we could compete with the Continent and obtain our fair share of the business that was ruling.    Now with a clip in Australia of close on 2,700,000 bales not more than three-quarters of our machinery can be run,  and that only .on speculation, for unless those handling the raw material buy on a speculative basis. i hoping to get their own money baok, very little raw material would come here     This is food for thought if we are t,o employ our workpeople in the future.   The hours of work have been reduced by the laws of economics and in the meantime mills are being closed, not to be opened again.    One of the largest mills on the outskirts Of Bradford has just given notice to their workpeople that they are going to wind up.    This is a mill formerly employing 1,000 hands and is not a concern by any means short of money for it is a wealthy concern, but they are closing before the capital, which has taken 70 to SO years to make,  is entirely gone.&quot;The strike of woolsorters which has been carried on in France is now terminated.    It has come to an end without any arrangement, simply by the return of the workers on the old basis.    This is serious to us because it indicates that our position in the West Riding is not likely to Improve and that France is still likely to keep her dominant position in securing orders against us,    Abroad stocks are accumulating, the position being as follows:-France.......   plus 134Germany......minus    38Belgium......    plus   72Italy........    plus    20plus plus plus plus772 454 152 131plus plus plus plus90S 396 224 151Compared with a Year Ago.France....... plus 117Germany...... plus 543Belgium...... minus 150Italy........ plus 412plus plus plus minusplus plus plus plus856 872 98 391
WOOL (CONTD. )The returns from all sections of the trade in this country - combing, spinning and weaving, all show a considerable reduction in the quantity of machinery running.    Very little change can be expected before September- as we are facing the holiday months and new business will not be placed for some weeks.MR ARTHUR SHAW wrote :-1 There has been very little change in the situation since I reported last month.   The dispute In the Calder Valley is now at an end, but no further negotiations have taken place with the employers on the general wages question.   From the reports which I have received from the various districts relative to unemployment, there has been a slight increase in every district over last month, the increase being more pronounced in the Huddersfield trade, particularly so in the lower qualities of goods made in the Colne Valley.    This also applies to the Yeadon area where there has been a continuous increase of the numbers who are signing the vacant register&quot;.HOSIERY.MR WALKER reported very little change in the state of trade In Nottingham as compared with a month ago.    The underwear trade remained steady and the spell of hot weather had helped to stimulate the summer trade; quite a number of repeat orders had been put in hand.    Business in all classes of outer wear still remained very good.   Fancy cashmere hose and half hoso showed an Improvement, while plain cashmere hose was as good as could be expected at this time of the year.    Fine gauge real and artificial silk hose continued In demand.At Loughborough the conditions in hosiery were slack and distinctly worse than a year ago.    There had been short time in underwear.    Pure silk and artificial silk seemed to be feeling the effect of the importation of goods in the rough state, which were being dyed in this country.,   Fancy half hose was suffering from importations from Italy.In Leicester the hosiery business in most branches was disappointing and showed some falling off since last month. Hosiery and underwear manufacturers complained that the steadily increasing importations of foreign made goods were having a very serious effect on employment.    There was very little total unemployment in the trade, but the number of workers on short time showed some increase.With regard to Hinckley, Mr. Walker read the following letter from the head of the trade there, which contained some controversial matter, but showed the state of mind in Hinckley;-
HOSIERY (CONTD.)&quot;Trade is bad, due to a variety of causes, but the chief ones are foreign competition and general unrest among wholesale houses owing to the uncertainty of the future.   Add to this Mr.Snowden&apos;s threat, or promise - put it which way you like - of wiping out silk duties, and you can see that it would be a bold man who would speculate.   No man is going to buy ahead if the Chancellor of the Exchequer is going to wipe out the equivalent of 1/- (more or less) per doz. on artificial silk hose of the class made in Hinckley.   He buys the foreign-made article at a price which we cannot touch and on which there is little risk of a fall.&quot;You ask me &apos;Haa there been over-production on artificial silk?&apos;   A difficult question to answer because one does not know quite what saturation point is.    Certainly this district has increased very largely in production, and we know that the wholesale trade only takes a certain amount of goods from a district, but I feel that if this foreign hosiery had not been imported in such large quantities this district would have righted itself easily.&quot;Have you seen the enclosed?    It is being bought by nearly all houses.    I send it to you because it Is not Continentalj it is United States of America, and the price is 7/11.    I suppose you know that hosiery is now being manufactured in California by nigger labour?   They are pure minders of machines, and are not allowed to touch the mechanical side.    The rate of pay of a nigger in America is considerably less than the rate of pay of the white man in England making hosiery.Mr. Walker exhibited the sample referred to in the letter. They were stockings which were sold here at 7/lld. per dozen pairs wholesale, and were a wonderful production at the price. They would probably be retailed with a good profit at 1/- per pair.Mr. Walker also asked if the President&apos;s statement with regard to the motor trade (see section on Motor Industry) applied also to the silk duties, which were not McKenna duties, nor of course Safeguarding duties; and whether his statement might be given publicity.THE PRESIDENT replied that the position had been quite clearly and publicly defined in the two days of debate in the House.    There were two categories, the Safeguarding duties and the Budget duties, and the latter covered the McKenna duties and the silk duties.    As he had already indicated to the Council, these Budget duties,  that is the McKenna duties and the silk duties could not in any circumstances be disturbed before the Budget of next year.
GAS INDUSTRY.SIR D. MILNE WATSON said that sales of gas were about normal. Prices of tar were very much lower than last year, especially for road &quot;tar;    that was due to competition in the supply of road-making material.     The result had been a very considerable increase In the use of tar on the roads during the last few months and the dry season had also tended to increase consumption.     With regard to pitch, which chiefly went abroad, prices were slightly better, owing to the fact that there were very low stocks in the spring in this country and In Germany.Sulphate prices were lower and were now somewhat under  9 a ton, as compared with  12 pre-war.     This was a very serious thing for the gas industry, and, no doubt, for the ooke Industry too, but especially for the gas Industry, because there was now a loss on the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, and even in the case of his own company their outlying manufacturing station was working at a loss on the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia. There was a little consolation In the fact that there had been an additional 10,000 tons used at home and, considering the state of British agriculture, that was all to the good.     With regard to world prospects, there was a large increase In synthetic sulphate manufacture and prices would be 10/- less next year than they were at present.     There had been a large extension of manufacturing&quot; plant at Billlngham in this country and other countries were also putting up plants, so that the market for sulphate of ammonia was not encouraging.With regard to creosote, as Sir David had previously mentioned, the United States had reduced the quantity they were taking from this country, and a definite limit had now been fixed as to quantity of creosote which might be sent in to the United States.     This meant a reduction all round as far as British exports were concerned, and at present the- Industry was trying to find new markets for creosote.     Coke prices for export were somewhat down, due to competition in the foreign markets.Generally speaking, the residuals market was bad, prices were unprofitable, and of course that had an effect on the other products.     The position was a serious one for the gas industry.RUBBER.SIR GEORGE BEEARRELL wrote:-&quot;Conditions remain practically as they were a month ago.&quot;A most Important point Is the importation of considerable numbers of very cheap cycle covers and tubes from the Continent;   also large quantities of very cheap sewn-bn rubber sole canvas footwear from Belgium at prices at which it is Impossible for British manufacturers to compete, in view of the difference in the conditions of employment.,
FINANCE.LORD BRADBURY said that during the first half of the month money had remained easy and the three months&apos; hill rate fell to 5-1%.   Although the New York Exchange hovered round the export gold point, a little below 4.85, no gold to speak of left the Bank and on balance about  1 million came in.   The 18th of the month had been a turning point -  1,100,000 in gold was withdrawn from the Bank of England for export to New York,   Bill rates immediately rose to 5-f$ and remained firm, close to Bank rate, for the rest of the month.The Mark exchange had also fallen below the export gold point, and large shipments of gold to Germany followed persistently day after day, without for a time much response in the Mark exchange, which did not rise above the gold point again until the early days of July,   The New York exchange persisted at or below the gold point and large shipments of gold were simultaneously going to America,Between June 12th and July 3rd, the Bank of england s gold reserve decreased by about  9 millions, from  164 millions to  155 millions, and fears of a rise in Bank rate were naturally entertainedj but the Bank did not find it necessary to act, and the Bank rate remained at 5^%.     Money was very tight at the end of the half year and on the last day of June almost unprecedented stringency was experienced.    It appeared that the Market had found it necessary to borrow at least  50 millions from the Bank of England.   At the moment the situation looked a little easier, the Bank having secured a good part of the gold which ha&amp; come from South Africa the previous week.SIR GUY GRANET wrote:&quot;The month of June was one of financial extremes.    In the first part there was the usual ease caused by the disbursement of the half yearly interest on the 5% War Loan, which was followed by the discount market*s preparations to meet the heavy calls for funds at the end of the half year, which this year necessitated borrowing at the Bank of England over  60,000,000, and which constitutes a record for this mid-year movement of funds.&quot;The adverse movements in the German and American exchanges insulting in heavy gold withdrawals have had rather a disturbing Influence on the discount and stock markets.   The rate for three months fine Bank bills rose at one time to 5 13/32$ but it has since eased off to about 5 11/32$, and there has been an &quot;all round reduction of prices in the stock markets.     The German exchange benefited by the restoration of confidence on the agreement of the experts attending the Reparations Conference In Paris, which made possible the arrangement of various loans  aid credits in America and this country at the higher rates of interest ruling in Germany.
FINANCE (CONTD.) .&quot;London has been the medium of transferring much of the credit established in America.   The French have been converting sterling balances into dollars In order to meet the possibility of having to  provide JS400,000,000 on August 1st next, and the Germans have been converting a portion of their dollar credits into sterling.    In the process of acquiring the necessary exchange the transfers of credit were so extensive that heavy gold shipments were necessary, and these movements undoubtedly accentuated the fears of dear money.   This week, however, the value of sterling has improved and dollars have been offered very freely,  said to be partly due to the belief that the decision of the French Cabinet to ratify the American debt agreement will be confirmed by the French Chamber, thus obviating the necessity af making the payment of the equivalent of  80,000,000 on August 1st,&quot;Obviously our financial outlook will continue to be dominated by the policy of other countries and much will depend on the American foreign and domestic monetary policy,&quot;GENERAL TRADE.SIR WALTER RAINB wrote:&quot;The salient points of the reports of trade which have come to me, are as follows&quot;information from Leicester shows that the boot and shoe, hosiery, underwear aid knitted goods trades are very disappoint-ing.   To a certain extent, the financial stringency is blamed for this.    On the other hand, It is pleasing to know that the building and general trade is good.   There is very little un-employment,  aid every indication of a continuation of this state of affairs.&quot;Liverpool advises that the provision trade has been goodj also that the wool sales were satisfactory; that ship-rep airing continues as busy as I reported a month ago.   The hides and leather trades have experienced a dull June.&quot;Nottingham reports that the lace trade Is good, and the experiments I have previously referred to, with the introduc-tion of silk and artificial silk, have been very successful.&quot;Durham and Northumberland coal trade.   This remains very firm.   The tonnage difficulty reported a month ago, continues particularly for the Baltic.   Nevertheless, the undoubted activity of trade in Belgium, Holland and other near Continental places, has caused a continued demand for all classes of coals.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).Added to this, six large orders amounting to 50,000 tons eef D.C.B. screened coals for Australia, with prospects of further business from the same direction, is most encouraging.   All these factors have helped to neutralise the effect of the tonnage shortage for the Baltic^&quot;Co-operative Wholesale Society.MR. HAYHURST reported that  sales generally during the past month had followed their usual course, and he was not aware of anything of an untoward character.    In comparison with the corresponding figures for last year, they showed a satisfactory increase, and the same remark applied to the Scottish trade.Their bank had again shown the same feature that he had mentioned before at the Council.    In spite of the depression in Lancashire and Yorkshire, during the past six weeks to two months  1,500,000 had been paid out for holiday funds in those two countlos.     This was somewhat puzzling in view of the big depression, but it afforded evidence at any rate of the thrift of the people.    Whether they would all use it for holidays or not remained to be seen.    Individual deposits in the banks were going up, and we should all feel gratified about this happening in the North In these depressing times.Supplies of Danish butter continued to clear without difficulty.   Continental enquiry had been disappointing, owing to the German output keeping rather more than usual. At the moment, Irish creamery butter was very good in quality.   As regards cheese, the market for New Zealand had been quiet, with unchanging quotations.    It was estimated that the stocks held in the three centres in this country were over 70,000 crates more than last year large quantities were being held in store, in the hope of higher prices ruling.    Mr. Hayhurst believed in the Empire Marketing Board, but he wanted its arrangements to be mutual.   We practically controlled three-fifths of the cheese produced in New Zealand, and he wanted reciprocity to come about with the Empire generally.In flour his Society had of course an enormous trade, and he hoped that the Council would take special notice of the serious difficulties there would be if any attempt were made at State purchase of wheat.   The Society had today 14,000 tons per week, which represented 600 sacks per hour.. . and It would be a very serious thing for the State to attempt anything in that matter, for after all the people must be the first consideration.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).Co-operative Wholesale Society (Contd,).In the first two weeks of June, fine teas continued in good request at rates maintained.    In the second two w eeks the market showed irregularity again, due to the indifferent qualities offering, and Ceylon teas in particular were of a bad quality, causing a decline up to Id. per pound, but nowhere was quality maintained.   During the last four weeks large supplies of coffee had again been auctioned, particular-ly from British East Africa, Costa Rica and East India. There had practically been no market in cocoa.   There had been a hold-up In West Africa, as the Council knew, and our cousins from across the Atlantic had badly burned their fingers in trying to coroner the market.DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES. .SIR WOODiJiN BURBIDGE wrote:-&quot;In any trade comparison with the  corresponding month last year allowance has to be made for the fact that this year June contained one working day less, and In Individual cases the f igures supplied are not helpful for comparative purposes, owing to variations in the dates for commencing the summer sales.   &quot;After making all the necessary allowances however, it seems clear that the reports in the trade press, that retail trade was brisk, have not been borne out by the figures, and once more the general conclusion must be that most concerns have found difficulty in maintaining their trade.&quot;in the West-End of London a large number of decreases, averaging 9$, are reported In the piece-goods departments, and increased sales in piece-goods are small and exceptional, Womens1  wear shows, on the whole, a slight but encouraging increase in sales.    Several snail decreases are reported, but may be accounted for by the loss of one working day, and the increases over last year average 12^%.    Mens1  wear is also some 15$ up, and has been better than for several months past.    Furniture, which has been dull recently, is about level to 5$ increase, and there is also a slight increase in the sale of hardware.    The boot and shoe department has again been disappointing, and any increases can be accounted for by special circumstances.   The sports departments are generally well up on the month, but food-stuffs and the miscellaneous departments have been slow, and, taking the turnover as a whole, last year&apos;s figures have been maintained Only with the greatest difficulty.*17r*

DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES (.OONT.fi. ) .&quot;In outer London the piece-goods, womon&apos;s wear, and men1s wear departments have all been dull, but a noteworthy feature is the substantial increase in furnivure sales, and in boots and shoes the sales appear to have been better than the experience in the West-End.    Ha/rdware has also been slow, and the general experience on the whole is unfavourable. There is no doubt that tho cold unseasonable weather has acted as a brake on business,  and although tho sports departments show cheerful increases all round, sales of light summer wear have been below expectations.&quot;Turning to the provinces* the feature both in the North and South is the small variation reported in the turnover of the different departments, making it difficult to detect any decided tendencies, and leading to the conclusion that figures have been difficult to maintain all over the country, and not merely in London.    In the North the piece-goods departments are about level to about 5 per cent, up;    in women&apos;s wear variations in turnover do not exceed 6 per cent, either way in any instance with one exception.    Men&apos;s wear is about level, but furniture and hardware are up 12 and 15 per cent, respoctively.   Boots and shoes are about 7^ per cent, down.     In the South the absence of settled warm weather has made business difficult, and has certainly handicapped trade, and results have not been too satisfactory.   Piece-goods and women1s wear are not more than 5 per cent, up, and the furniture departments in some cases have done well;    but, generally speaking, variations are of no great significance, and, taken as a whole, figures are slightly lower on the month.&quot;Reports from Wales agree that trade in that area continues to be difficult, and any increases reported are due more to special efforts made to promote sales than to any increased prosperity among the spending population.&quot;SHIPPING.MR.

RAILWAY TRAFFIC  (OOITTD. ) .&quot;Complete statistics are available only up to the 30th Aprilv 1929,   These shew that there has been an increase in the total number of passenger journeys taken during the four months compared with the corresponding period of 1928 but there was a large deorease in the number of passengers conveyed at ordinary fares and a consequential diminution in receipts.

In this connexion it may be stated that new mechanically propelled goods vehicles registered are increasing and that at the end of February 1929 the number was 20,. 000 more than at the corresponding   date in 1928.&quot;The position at the end of April was much better than at the end of March.    In April the receipts from Merchandise and Minerals shewed an increase of  693,252, partly due to the incidence of Easter but more especially to the increase in the tonnages of such traffics as iron and steel mats-rials and products, building materials (which diminished during the severe weather in February and March) roadmaking materials potatoes, manure etc.   The iron and steel figures seem to suggest that the &quot;lag&quot; which exists between the beginning of &apos; an improvement in trade and the time when the manufactures are handed over to the railway companies for conveyance is being overtaken.&quot;The details which are available in respect of the&apos; principal traffics conveyed by the railway companies shew the following fluctuations in the receipts for the four months ended 30th April compared with the corresponding period of 1928:-Incr  .Iron Ore .............     48,711Pig Iron............ .      27,432Iron &amp; Steel Scrap ... 53,379 Iron &amp; Stool in Clxsc 3 25,525 Limestone for blastfurnaces ........;. . .       6,885Machinery ............       9,920Manure, packed.......     41,828Potatoes .............     72,967ases.Oils not dangerous... 42,663Tar and Pitch ....... 14,437Hardware ............ 16,526Sugar, Glucose,Sasoharum &amp; Treacle. 30,027 Confectionery andPreserves........... 9,597Textiles &amp; Clothing.. 13,596Cotton, raw......... 3,603Bricks ............, . 5,836

Class 6 includes semi-manUfactured materials such as bars, blooms, billets and ingots, while the finished materials and articles are included In the higher classes.   During the month of- April there was an increase of  43,126 in the latter.. The heavy falling off In the carryings of Grain, Flour and Milling Offalsj Oil cake and Meat, appear to have been general throughout the country.   The causes are not known except that it is stated farmers have been using less oil cake for feeding cattle owing to the fall in the price of cereals.   The falling off in road making and building materials was general, and was probably due to a large extent to the severe weather in February and March.   The depression in the woollen industry is reflected In the carryings of raw wool, while road competition may be affecting the quantities of ale and porter forwarded by rail,&quot;With regard to the receipts of the individual companies: the position is improving on the principal freight-carrying lines and In addition to the increases obtained by the London and North Eastern and Great Western Companies from Coal, coke and patent fuel, the following increases were recorded in April, in the receipts from merchandise and minerals:-Company,  London Midland &amp; Scottish 249,732 London &amp; North Eastern., 255,423 Great Western............     141,668

EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS wrote:-&quot;There was a little change on the whole in the unemploy-ment figures during June.     The numbers wholly unemployed continued to decline and reached a figure of approximately 764,000 on the 24th of the month.     This was about. 130,000 less than the figure for 18th March, the first date which was free from the effects.of the frost.     There was, on the other hand, a continuous rise in the numbers temporarily stopped, due mainly to the position In coal mining and the cotton textile Industry, and this movement was accelerated in the last week of the month.     As a result, the total figures which at 24th June were only about 17,700 above those for 3rd June, increased by 24,500 between 24th June and 1st July.&quot;There is evidence also that the seasonal increase in unemployment which usually appears at this time of the year, has again made itself felt.     The figures for every Division, including London and the South Eastern, shared in the increase at 1st July, while for earlier weeks the Southern Divisions had generally shown improvement in their figures.&quot;I attach a Table giving preliminary figures of unemployment in certain industries at 24th June and also the usual table of numbers in employment In the insured trades-.Great Britain.Insured persons recorded as unemployed,27th May,  1929.dustry.Number.24th June,1929.Per Cent.NumberPer Cent.Increase C+) Decrease  (-)orNumberPer Cent.Mining ralineering, building Ship airing, onlen &amp; sted. dingustries,199,163 54,59243,651 77,78027,862 69,8521,141,75617.9 9,522 e 8 14.011.5 8.79.8204,012 50,64242,824 76,04433,545 67,7421,127,89518.3 8.822.4 13.713.9 8.49.24-4,849 -3,950- 827 -1,7364-5,683 -2,110-13,861+ 0.4 - 0.7- 0.4- 0.3+ 2.4- 0.30,1

The increasing popularity of
AUSTRALIAN TRADE (CONTD).artificial silk and similar fabrics are regarded as responsible for the large decrease in the world&apos;s consumption of wool and also for the 25c/o fall in price last -year, causing a loss of about  15,000,000 to Australian growers.    A conference of vool growers discussed a &quot;Use More  Tool&quot; publicity 3cheme which was estimated to cost  1,500,000.    The proposal was referred to the State Graziers&apos; Association for report.    The estimated quantity of wool expected to be received into brokers&apos; stores during the 1929/30 season is 2,585,000 bales,  a decrease of 102,000 bales compared with the 1938/29 clip.    The Graziers&apos; Federal Council defeated a motion recommending prohibition of export of stud merino sheep,  the decision being largely influenced by Empire considerations.    At the Brisbane sales last month there was a demand for good wool, particularly the finer-grades.    Competition was good, Bradford and the Continent being prominent.    Prices went up to about 5fo below the May rates.The exports of -wheat this season reached 70,357,429 bushels, comparedwth 39,603,6&quot;14 bushels last season.    Flour exports this season amounted to 330,560 tons as compared with 235,617 tons last season.    The greater part of the wheat and flour was shipped to non-European countries.    The importation of pedigree stock from Great Britain has been resumed and some cattle arrived in Australia last month.The Commonjealth imports for the ten months ended April last were valued at  119,810,233, exports at  127,566,468, a decrease of  5,693,252 and an increase of  3,881,417, respectively, compared with the same period a year before.    In 1923/29 the Customs revenue was  41,043,743, a decrease of  403,000 compared with the previous yearly period.INDIAN TRADE.MR. GREEN reported that the Indian seaborne trade figures for May began to show the ordinary seasonal decline. Imports were nearly  2-g- millions less than in April last, but nevertheless were well above the figures of May of last year.    Exports were about  1^ millions down on the preceding month, and were also lower than in May 1928.    They were, however, higher than in May 1927.    The visible balance of trade in favour of India In May was over  if millions.   He had mentioned last month the new rupee loan of the Government of India, subscriptions to which were to be limited to  201 millions.    The issue had proved very successful and bad been over-subscribed,, applications being made for over  27-g- millions.    He thought that was rather interesting, in view of the recent rumours that there was so great a scarcity of capital for investment in India.The monsoon had opened well, most parts of the country having received good rains.    In certain areas, however, notably Assam and Eastern Bengal, the rains had been extraordinarily
INDIAN TRADE (CONTD).keavy and serious floods had occurred.   Happily there appeared to have been little loss of human life, hut damage to property had in some cases been described as appalling.    Crops, of course, had also suffered, but as a general rule an excess of water in India was much less serious than a deficiency.   The latest cabled information that he had had that morning indicated that the crops, generally speaking, in India had made a very satisfactory start.   The preliminary jute forecast issued at the beginning of this month indicated an area sown of 3,330,000 acres, as compared with last year&apos;s revised figure of 3,144,000 acres.   Until the excessive rains there had been excellent prospects of a good crop.    It was difficult at present to estimate how much damage had been done, and what the final crop was likely to be.    Prices had risen as a result.    Apart from this, agricultural conditions were generally satisfactory.The Royal Commission on Indian Agriculture had recommended the establishment of an Imperial Council of Agricultural Research in order to establish a closer contact between scientific investigators under the Central Government and Provincial Governments.   The Government of India had now instituted such a Council, and proposed to endow it with an initial lump sum of twenty-five lakhs of rupees ( 187,500), and to give it a further annual grant of seven and a quarter lakhs ( 54,375).COLONIAL TRADE.MR. VEKN0N stated that the complete trade returns for Ceylon for 1928 were now available.   They showed the value of imports to be 400 million rupees, exports 389 million rupees, making a total trade of 789 millions.    That was a rather substantial fall on the previous three years, due mainly to the reduced price of rubber and tea.   The proportion of the imports from the United Kingdom had been about constant through the three years 1926 to 1928 at between 22 and 33^5. The imports from British possessions, mainly India, were nearly 48$ in 1928, while the imports from foreign countries, though a little higher in 1938 than previously, were still less than 30$From Malaya the total rubber export last year was 408,000 tons, of which 61,000 tons came to this country and 284,000 tons to the United States.    The first four months of this year showed a total export of 200,000 tons, against 104,000 tons for the same period last year.    There was also an increase in the export of tin from 19,000 tons in the first four months of 1938 to 21,000 tons in the corresponding period this year.    The total trade figures from Malaya in 1928 showed - like Ceylon - a reduction from 1927 due to the same reason.    The imports in 1938 were  100 millions in value as against  116 millions in the previous year, and the exports were  98 millions as against  125 millions.    Coming
COLONIAL TRADE (OONTD).to some details, there was a big fall in the imports of piece goods into Malaya in the last three years.    Cement from the United Kingdom had failed to keep pace with foreign competition, imd cements imported from Japan, Indo-China and Sumatra were said to be up to British standard and were gaining popularity with the ordinary public, though British cement was still being used by railways and public works departments and, no doubt, the Admiralty.    The figures for motor cars were of some interest;    there had been a big and continuous fall in the number of cars imported during the past three years.    In 1933 the total number of passenger cars Imported was 9,138, while last year the figure was 4,391, which was less than half.    That was attributed mainly to the heavy fall in the price of tin and rubber, which had left people leas money to spend on motor cars. The figures of the country of origin were of some interest.    In 1923, taking passenger oars, 1,433 came from the United Kingdom, 865 came from British possessions (almost entirely Canada),&quot;and 1,465 came from the United States.    The proportion of American cars seemed to be rather less than two years earlier.   The figures for commercial cars were very much the same - in 1936 a total Import of 2,125, which fell last year to 1,438.    Of these imported last year, 371 came from the United Kingdom, 393 from other British possessions, i.e. Canada, and 766 from the United States.There were very good reports of the export of cotton from Uganda for the current year, with the expectation of a substantial increase over last year.    The estimate was put at 190,000 bales as against 138,000 last year.    The fiprures of mineral production in Northern Rhodesia for the first four months of 1929 showed a very considerable increase over the corresponding period of 1928, the figures being  318,000 for this year, as compared with  332,000 for 1928.The position in the sugar growing colonies at the present moment was extremely serious and there was an acute crisis in the case of Mauritius and Barbadaes.    The figures showed a price of  12.10.0 a ton as against a cost of manufacture of  14 in the case of Mauritius, and a price of  11.4.0 a ton as against a cost of manufacture of  12.15.0 a ton in the case of Barbadoes.    Those two colonies, though not the only ones we depended upon for sugar, were the two colonies of which it might be said that there was no alternative crop whatever, and if prices continued at the figures mentioned, both those colonies were faced with something like ruin, ?md vould have to receive assistance in some form or another.    Particularly in the case of Mauritius there was a grievance about an alteration made last year in the Budget in the method of calculating the duties on sugar, which had the effect of reducing the preference on the kind of sugar mainly made in Mauritius.    The alteration made last year in the method of calculation - which was not a matter of policy at all - was said to have resulted in penalising the Mauritius sugar by at least 9d. a cwt., and some pressure /as certain to be brought to bear upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer to alter the nethod of calculation this year.
TRADE WITH RUSSIA.MR, HAYHURST recalled that at a previous meeting of the Council he had given some figures in regard to the trade of the Co-operative Wholesale Society with Russia.   He desired to repeat that, after the experience of three to four yearsT trading with that country, the Society had found that every obligation due to them had up to now been met.   It was only fair that that statement should be made.   He did not know if there was any obstacle in the way, or anything which they oould help to mitigate or to remove, but in his opinion at any rate there was good business waiting to be done.   One had difficulty in getting the Russians to speak frankly, because they had affaire to deal with in their own country, and they were very oarefully watched, there was no doubt about thatj but the transactions that the Society had had with their representatives who had been here, had been of a most satisfactory charaoter.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE sent a written report to the following effectIt has been announced that, following upon negotiations conducted by the Chilean Finance Minister In England and Germany, an agreement has been reached with the leading interests in the synthetic nitrate industry for oo-operation with the Chilean producers in the disposal of fertilisers, and a lo,-?ering of the general level of prices.   An agreement of this nature had been advocated for a considerable time past in many quarters closely connected with the Chilean nitrate industry, and its conclusion should prove eminently satisfactory to all concerned.   Ultimately, no doubt, arrangements will be made for the control of production in accordance with the demand for consumption, and stability will thereby be imparted to the fertiliser Industries and markets generally,The trade situation in Chile as a whole continues satisfactory, and, in the mining industries, copper production continues at a high level.     Latest advices received from Argentina indicate that a partial reaction has occurred in the general commercial situation from the previous prosperous conditions, trade is seasonally depressed, and the outlook somewhat uncertain.   The change has been chiefly to the decline during recent months in the prices of the Republic&apos;s export commodities.   In the normal course, a contraction in the total value of the export trade of the country is followed by a similar movement in imports, and vice versa.    In the early months of the current year, imports were fairly heavy, so that it appears probable that the returns of the values of imports and exports for the first-half of the current year, when published, will show an appreciable diminution in the favourable balance of trade, especially If the movement of gold be also taken into account;    exports of the metal to London and New York have in fact continued on an appreciable scale during the past month.   Should the final result of the trade movement for the first half of 1989 show a surplus in the value of Imports over exports, the demand for foreign
&apos; SQUTH._AMEP.IQAH TRADE (OONTD.)manufaotures in the Argentine import markets would diminish owing to decreased purchasing power of the community.   In all&apos; the circumstances, it is satisfactory to observe that world prices of wheat have recovered somewhat from the extremely low levels recorded recently.   The Argentine agricultural areas continue to Buffer from lack of rain.   Ploughing and sowing are proceeding, except in the areas where rain is urgently neeaedj    it is now somewhat late to re-commence ploughing for the fine cereal crops.   Harvesting of the maize is being completed.During the past month, there has been no appreciable amelioration in the difficult commercial situation in Brazil, Conditions in the money market have eased, but unfortunately this is due to the extremely dull conditions in the commercial markets, and to the consequent lack of demand for credit facilities.   Proopects in the import trade are uncertain and the local import markets for textile goods do not appear to have reoovered from the over-stocking due to the increases in the tariff a few months ago.An appreciable improvement has occurred in the general trade outlook in Peru as a result of the final settlement with Chile regarding tEe&quot;&quot;sovereignty of the Taona and Arica Provinces,    There has been increased activity in the markets f^or Peruvian raw ootton and, despite the relative abundance of stocks, sellers are still disposed to maintain prices at a comparatively high level.   The weight of exports of cotton from the country since the beginning of the year is appreciably higher than in the corresponding period of 1928, especially in regard to shipments to New York,In Colombia, business is generally dull, and orders for merchandise are limited to immediate needs.    Sales of textile goods and luxury articles have decreased, although imports of staple articles are moderate and the volume of stocks is lower.    The undertone of the commercial situation is sound but prospects of Increased sales are uncertain.    Surveys have been ^carried out with a view to the establishment of an air service from New York to Colombia, and, in view of the extent to which transport lines count in the present extreme trade competition, this further link with New York is significant.The outlook in Venezuela is overshadowed by somewhat uncertain political conditions, although the situation as a whole has improved to some extent.   Business in Guateinala is dull and the current volume of trade is less than&quot;ThaV or a yoar ago, although the coffee situation is normal, both in regard to prices and demand.   Imports of dry goods, textiles and other lines appear to have diminished.    In Ecuador, there are few signs of an early recovery in trade and reports from the coffee and cocoa estates are not optimistic.   Trade in Salvador has latterly been very quiet and the coffee market there is Inactive, A large crop of coffee is expected next season.
APPEND DC.Sir E. Petter&apos;s report on conditions In the gg-RlftQering j-industries In Europe, the uhxBed &quot;States m the II.K.ffAGSS AND WORKING HOURS IN ENGINEERING INDUSTRIES.It has been commonly known for a long time that British metal industries have been seriously handicapped in competitive trade by the relatively low level of wages paid and the longer hours worked in the corresponding continental industries.   One or two leading illustrations may be quoted and compared with the returns published by the E.E.F. m April 1928 which gives the average hourly earnings for skilled workers (adults) all classes, time and piece work together, at 17.9 pence, and unskilled at 12 pence, based.upon a 47 hour week.    The results published by the French Statistical Office, of the annual enquiry for 1928 Into wages of the metal, engineering and allied industries in France show that the hourly earnings of engineering time workers    expressed as an average covering all classes, is equivalent to 8sd. to ll%dj correspondingly for all classes of piece workers, 9-^d. to l/o^d. and for all classes of unskilled workers, 6ad. to 7-Jd. per hour.   These rates include all bonuses and allowances  (except family allowances which, when paid, usually amounted to approximately 5/- per month for one child, 12/- for two children, 2c/- for three, and about 13/- for each additional child).As regards Germany, the latest statistics published by the German Federal Statistical Office, relating to 1st February, 1929, give the average basic hourly rate of skilled workers In the metal industries as 11.7d. and the weekly rate as 49/5-g-d.   These amounts show a very slight increase as compared with a year previous.   The average unskilled hourly rate, however,  at 1st February was 8.9d equivalent to 36/lO^d. per week.   These amounts compared with 8,3d. and 34/5d. respectively, -      the corresponding rates at 1st February, 1928.    This shows a considerable increase which has taken place In the last twelve months in the wages rates of unskilled workers in Germany.   These wages rates quoted for Germany are inclusive of family allowances, where paid.In Germany, as in France, the nominal working week in the metal and engineering industries is 48 hours;    but In both countries much latitude is allowed, and,  in fact, practised, the working week in Germany ranging in various districts from 48 up to 60 hours.    In the metal industry at Hamburg, Bremen,   and six other towns in North-West Germany, the average normal week worked was 52 hours.It Is interesting to note that, according to the results of the enquiry into working hours made by the General Confederation of German Trade Unions, as at 6th October 1928, it was found that out of over one and a half million workers in metal and general engineering trades, more than one-third worked a normal full time week exceeding 48 hours.
appeitdix (contd).-The appropriate official organ of the Italian Government, the  &quot;Gazetta Uff iciale&quot; , in a recent issue recorded that the average real earnings per hour of general engineering workers in Italy in March 1928 amounted to 2.45 lire (roughly equivalent say to 6fd) and in specialised engineering to 2.86 lire (equal to 7^d). These figures, however,&quot;include all workers irrespective of sex or age, skilled or unskilled, and therefore must understate the earnings of the adult skilled workers.   With regard to hours of working, the terms of the official agreement made in February, 1928, between the Fascist Employers Federation and the Fascist Trade Unions in the engineering and metal Industries, stipulated the normal working week for engineering and allied industry to be 48 hours of effective work, but a worker might not refuse without just cause to work overtime up to a maximum of 10 hours per week.    Thus it -will be seen that sufficient scope exists for a considerable extension of the working week above the 48 hour limit.On the data available, it would appear that metal and engineering wages rates on the Continent, skilled or unskilled, do not exceed 70$ of the corresponding rates paid in this country.The latest official figures issued by the United States Bureau of Labour gives the overall average earnings of male workers in the foundries and machine 3hops as  .S3 dollars per hour (approximately 2/7d.), and the average hours worked per week at 50 to 51.    The average full time earnings per week were stated at almost 32 dollars ( 6.11.6).    It is well understood that in America the 48-hour week is scarcely,  if at all, observed in the engineering shops.COMPARATIVE PRICES OF HAW MATERIALS.It is, of course, a fact that current wages rates in the continental metal industries over the last two years have increased slightly, as also have the prices of their products, 1 even those quoted for export; so that the wide margin between the continental and British prices which existed to our utter detriment two or three years ago has been appreciably lessened, but British trade in metal products is still at a considerable disadvantage in most markets, competing against continental manufactures which can be quoted at, a lower level by reason of the smaller wages cost, longer hours worked,  special export bounties and subsidies, and exceptional low transport rates which, in some cases, effectively offset the longer hauls to the ports.British pig iron (Cleveland Ho. 3 Foundry) is today quoted at  3.12.6 per ton, but French and German pig iron of approximately the same grade i3 quoted f.o.b. for the 3ritish market at  3.7.6 to  3.10.0.    The current price of equivalent American pig iron d/d Pittsburgh, is    3&apos;. 19.6 per ton.    Generally the price of American pig iron is at a higher level than the British product; if for nothing else, because of the long and costly transport haulage required.
APPENDIX (CONTD).In any case America is not yet a very serious competitor In the world&apos;s iron and steel export trade, and pig iron is a product In regard to which, the British blast furnaces reap in special degree the advantages of the comparatively close proximity to one another of our coal fields, iron mines, ironworks,  and sea port3.It is, however, when we come to semi-finished and finished products that the full advantage given to the continental producer by cheaper costs of production Is seen more clearly.   Thus steel sheet bars are priced here at  6.7.6 per ton, but German and Belgian equivalents are quoted f.o.b. Antwerp from  5.8.0 per ton.   The French quotation has recently been somewhat higher.   American sheet bars, as quoted at Pittsburgh, stood at  7.8.6.   To take an example of a finished product, steel joists, which were quoted for the . British home market at  8.2.6 per ton (subject to rebate In special cases) are reduced for export to a special quotation of  7.2.6; but, actually, continental joists and sections are quoted for delivery in Birmingham as low as  6.10.0 to  6.12,6 per ton.   The alternative quotation, as f.o.b, Antwerp stood recently at  5.4.0 per ton.   The American quotation at Pittsburgh is  8,15.6.RELATIVE TRANSPORT CHARGES.Great Britain, as regards the relative geographical situation of her seaports, coalfields, and iron aid steel and engineering works, possesses great advantages over the other principal producing countries.    In the United States, for instance, the average transportation mileage per ton of raw materials and finished products is several times greater than in this country.    It has been said that a ton of steel can be carried from Sheffield to the St. Lawrence Ports in Canada for a lower inolusive transport cost than a ton of American steel can be carried from United States works to those same Canadian -Ports.British railway freight rates on the raw materials and products of the metal Industries are now about 50$ above pre-war, the corresponding Increase In America being estimated at 60$.     As regards the continental countries, railway freight rates, relative to pre-war, are lower than ours,the Increases ranging from 25$ to 75$. but mostly below 50$.   To counteract this, however, the distances of haul are considerably greater than in this country.    In Belgium, for instance, works in several cases  are 80 miles from the port.    Some of the haulage distances in   France are six times as long as our British average, and in Germany seven to eight times.   The average haul in U.S.A. for steel and machinery is fully eleven times the average distance here. So that while, in all these countries, a much lower rate per mile applies, the total freight charge per ton is much higher than in this country.   The following gives comparison of freight rates on steel and machinery in Britain, Germany and U.S.A. expressed as index numbers (Britain s 100).

This is certainly borne out by the analysis of the financial results in recent years of engineering and allied industry.   The B.E.A. each year compiles a summary and analysis of these financial results, in respect of a sample of sixty-six representative firms.     The results for the financial year 1928, show that the improvement recorded in 1927 over the inevitably unfortunate results of 1926, has been at least maintained,but earned profits, expressed as a percentage of the paid-up capital, have not improved.    The amount distributed in dividends to paid-up oapital, although only amounting to 4,3 per cent, is again in excess of the earned profits.    The ratio of dividends to paid-up capital is slightly greater than the corresponding index for 1927.   This, however, is mainly due to a larger payment of preference dividends, more companies in 1928 having been able to meet their preference obligations and in one or two cases to pay off arrears of dividend.    A notable increase in the total sum appropriated to reserves is a good sign, but, on the other hand, the aggregate net amount carried forward shows a further big drop, attributable to the large accumulating debit balances returned in one or two  instances.It has already been frequently observed that the meagre and disappointing return on capital invested in engineering industry, as recorded in those statistics, compares very unfavourably with the muoh higher yields obtainable from certain relatively non-productive forms of investment, e,g. shops and stores (10$ to 20$), hotels and reataurants (about 10$;, breweries (approximately 15$) and banks and other financial houses (15$ to 20$).     These figures go a very long way to explain the present inability of our ba-sic industries to attract from the investing public the supply of vitalising new oapital which is absolutely necessary for enterprise and expansion.
