Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Executive Council of the Transport and General Workers Union hap called my attention to the penalties imposed by decision of the late Government upon the established employees of the Admiralty establishments at Woolwich and Deptford who took part in the General Stoppage of 1936, and has urged that they should be reconsidered. 2. As these penalties took the fprm of a disallowanceof part of tho men?s former service for purposes of pension, and the Superannuation Acts constitute the Treasury the sole and final authority in all pension questions, I have con-suited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, -who has expressed his willingness that I should bring the matter before the Cabinet. 3. The following are ^!e&apos; facts.-4. When the General Stoppage of 1926 occurred, the participation of the Royal Dockyards and other Naval industrial establishments was not encouraged, and no steps were taken, by the Headquarters of the Trade Unions concerned to call out their members.   At four Admiralty Establishments, however., (via., The Royal Victoria Victualling lard, Deptford; Royal Naval Store Depot, r/est India Docks; Royal Naval Armament Depot, Woolwich; and the Naval Ordnance Inspection Department, Woolwich) the men took the matter into their own hands, and 4.51 hired and 32 established employees stopped work for the whole period cf the General Stoppage,   Other Established! men wont out, but returned to duty after receipt of an official notice warning them of the probable consequences of their action.Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).SI; jfe248/ 29. 0 A 3 1 1: Z ?.i     (Jil^PAL   S&apos;JP?PW3   OF   19  .Position of Established Admiralty Employees who took part0
5. When the stoppage ended, it was decided that thehired employees were to he re-entered at once, or so soon as work was available for them.   The period of absence was treated as &quot;absence without leave&quot;, but this has no practical effect on the gratuities which they receive at the end of their service.6. Those established men, who did not return before   -the strike ended, on the other hand., were differently treated on the ground that they had, as a condition of establishment, signed a special agreement &quot;by which they undertook to render faithful service, to obey tho Admiralty regulations and the instructions of their superior officers, and at all times to use their best endeavours for the advantage of H .M.Service, and declared their readiness to perform their duties at all such times as might, in the opinion of their superior officers (subject to the Admiralty regulations), be necessary to meet the exigencies of the Service *7. The decision in their case was set forth in thefollowing extract from the official notice which was issued at the time:-&quot;The Eoard having regard to ail the circumstances &quot;are prepared to condone completely the action of the &quot;established men who returned to their duty before the eon-&quot;clusion of the strike, and are also willing to re-enter on &quot;the establishment all other established men concerned &quot;except one man, who, after investigation, is considered to &quot;have committed definite acts of misconduct in improperly &quot;instigating the men to this breach of the regulations and &quot;who will be discharged from the Service for this misconduct.&quot;The...
&quot;Tlie-re-admission to the establishment, however, &quot;must he subject to a signed declaration by each individual &quot;concerned recognising that by his recent action he wrong-5!*fully broke his contract of employment and his obligation &quot; to give good and faithful service,and undertaking not to &apos; &quot;commit any such breach in future.&quot;Re-admission to the establishment will necessarily &quot;involve the issue of fresh Civil Service Certificates, &quot;and the proper steps will &quot;have to be taken to obtain those.&quot;In the ordinary course, such a break in established &quot;service involves forfeiture of all previous service for &quot;pension, but in the present instance, this condition will be &quot;waived as follows:-&quot;On re-entry on the establishment men who under the &quot;regulations have forfeited more than 15 years established &quot;time will &quot;be allowed to count such previous time less four &quot;years.&quot;Those who have forfeited more than 10 years and &quot;less than 15 years established time will he allowed to &quot;count such previous time less 3 years.&quot;Those who have forfeited more than 2 years and &quot;less than 10 years established time will be allowed to &quot;count such previous time less 2 years.&quot;Those who have forfeited less than 2 years &quot;established time will not he allowed to count that time.&quot; 8. In the case of the Royal Victoria Yard, at any rate,the local representatives of the Workers Union, and Transport and General iVorkers Union, and the employees side of tho lard Industrial Whitley Committee signed a statement accepting, on behalf of the established employees who had absented them-selves, the conditions imposed in this notice and also made formal declarations acknowledging &quot;that the men who went on strike without notice thereby committed a wrongful act.&quot;
9. The penalisation of the established men consists in the loss, not only of the short period during which they were absent from duty, but of part of the time which they had previously served..   This decision was challenged at the time, on behalf of tho Labour party by the present Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as being a departure from the spirit of the declarations mado by the then Prime Minister in regard to the resumption of work after the General Stoppage (see Parliamentary Debates, Official Report 20th May 1926). As an illustration of what it means to the men affected I may say that one of them retired last year, and, in consequence of this decision suffered a loss of over  5 a year in pension, and over  14 in gratuityr   Recalling all the circumstances of the time I cannot help feeling that such penalties are very heavy and that the insistence upon them when men retire perhaps 10 or 20 years hence ?/ill not confer any benefit, or reflect any crodit upon the State.10o It has been represented to me that it is in theinterests of all Governments alike, whatever their political sympathies, that they should be able to rely with as much confidence on their established civilian employees as on the officers and mon of the fighting services to carry on their duties, whatever the circumstances and that, unless establishment gives the State this protection, there is little justification for its continuance.11. I do not deny the force of this argument and forthis reason I would propose that if the Cabinet should decide to remit the penalties   announced in 1928, this should not be done on any grounds that might be held to imply a general admission of tho right of established employees of the State to go on strike, nor eny condonation of the action of these particular men who have already been declared by the officials
of their unions to.have acted wrongly.   The penalties could, I suggest, be remitted purely as an act of grace, with the object of removing a widely felt sense of grievance for what is felt to have been an unduly harsh decision. 12. It must, of course, be remembered that since the penalties will be enforced only on the retirement of the men concerned, the present government cannot give a final decision in the matter any more than the last government could. It is, in fact, quite probable that none of the men concerned will have their pensions assessed during the life of the present parliament0   Whatever decision is now reached, therefore, may be altered by some future government,.   But in my opinion the probability is that any future government will acquiesce in the remission of such penalties, oven though they might not have been prepared to initiate similar action. 13. . The question also arises whether the reconsideration of these penalties (so far as it is in our power) will involve any reconsideration of the action cf the late government in dismissing one man in 1926, and awarding a reduced pension to another (referred to in paragraph 9).   So far as the latter case is concerned, I certainly think it would be necessary to extend the act of grace so as to cover the award.   The dismissal, on the other hand,, is on quite a different footings It -was a punishment inflicted not for absence from work, but for alleged definite acts of misconduct after an enquiry held by members of the Admiralty Board,   The Trade Unions have not up to the present raised this case, and I should not propose to ro-open it unless they do so, and produce prima facie evidence of a miscarriage of justice.A a Vo A,dmira&apos;1 ty,19tlTseptember 1929.
