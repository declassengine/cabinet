As there may he some uncertainty as to how we stand at presentg I have thought it desirable to have the facts set out in this Memorandum*2o     Apart from the suspended defence scheme, and the now comple teds SLoating Dock, the total estimated coat of what is known as the Truncated Scheme and expenditure to date is as followsTotalEstimateo  Vote 10 - Works ....    6,917,000 &quot;     0 - Machinery. n     8 - 2umi ture *810, 000 23,000 7,750,000Expended to gX&quot;o go  29c 693, 241 30,5009,000732,741Remaining. 6,223,759 779,500 14,000 7;017,259ti n m   ti ,*r r asa a sr si3o      Of the amount shown as remaining to he spent  3,721,474 represents the amount of Sir Ju Jackson1s contract.     Of the rest it cannot he stated that aoy items are not subservient to the purpose of the main contract (the Truncated Scheme itself being the minimum requirements for making adequate use of the Floating and Graving Docks), but there are a considerable number of items of expenditure on which work need not commence before 1932 in order to reach completion of the whole scheme by 1937.

It will be apparent, however, that as regards the items in paragraph 3, the difference is mainly one of date and 1  as the Graving Dock nears completion,, workshops, store sheds, railway   lines, etc.,  are not provided and equipped, the Docks on which so much money has been spent will 1)8 incapable of being usedc7*     To have spent so much money upon the provision of Docks and then to leave them in such a condition that adequate use could not be made of them without undertaking further work extending over a period of years would not seem to be an easily defensible position,  and it would seem desirable therefore to find some justification for completing the Graving Dock other than the financial one arising from considerations of compensation to the Contractor and to the Dominions *8*      The decision to proceed with the Graving Dock will bo criticised in Parliament from both liberal and Labour Benches.

if we are not clear that the completion of the Graving Dock&apos; will Involve carrying out the complete scheme, we should also he faced with Conservative criticism supported &quot;by the Dominions09o     I attach a memorandum dealing with the matter in the light of certain queries by the Prime Minister which I think gives the answer on strategical and commercial grounds and provides the reasons for completion of the work in its entirety, which would obviate the Conservative criticism.    The financial grounds have already &quot;been reported to the Cabinet.     I attach also a statement of: suggested modifications in the estimates of expenditure already reported,  to make them accord with the policy proposed-A.    V.

A P P E IT D^IJE___I,Memorandum on . the poll, cy of Singapore *gMERAL sroATSSICAL COKSID^^TICflLTS^^        The decision to develop Singapore as a modem naval base was dictated by the necessity for defending imperial interests in the East and,  in particular,  for ensuring thesecurity of -(l) Our interests in China.(b) Our communications with Australia and Eew Zealand*(3) India from an attack from the PaeificoIn connection with the location of the bases it should be borne in mind- that Singapore has been a ELeet base for 50 years, with annual concentrations of the China? Asutralia end East Indies Squadrons -    There is therefore no new Singapore base; the present policy is directed towards modernising one already long-established.The defensive nature of the modem naval base is inherent in its position..    Situated, &quot;as it iss over 2S000 miles from the nearest naval power it can represent no aot ci aggression^    On the other hand its key position in relation to the trade and territories of the Empire in the East make it a vital position for the basing of our sea power in self-defencej if required^That being the case,  the change in the international situation, created by the Pact of Paris since the decision to develop the Singapore base was taken-, does not eliminate the main consideration on which that decision was founded* War as an instrument of national policy has been abolished by the Pact, but the possibility of a war in self-defence still remains, as has been made abundantly clear in the utterances both of the authors of the Pact itself, and also of European statesmen*At /
At the same time,  the favourable internationalatmosphere has permitted the original scheme to be modified,ana the present &quot;Truncated Scheme71 is the outcome of. that^process3    Those parts of the full scheme are being proceeded with which will take some years to complete and could not therefore be taken in hand at short noticej  should thepolitical situation change for the worse *The   general strategical considerations governing the Singapore Base might be summed up as follows(a)    Imperial strategy is directed to the secux-ity of our Imperial interests - in other words - to self-defence?(b )    Singapore is admirably placed for protectingour J?ar Eastern interests; on the other hand it is awkwardly place! for aggressive operations;(c)    The Pact of Paris does not mitigate -thenecessity fox&apos; making complete provision for self-defencej but the international atmosphere created thereby has permitted the original scheme to be mo&amp;ifiedo11&apos;   THE TRiOTCATED; SCHfflffi *Admitting that general strategical considerationsnecessitate the carrying out of a limited scheme of developsmerit of the Singapore Base,  it is necessary to considerwhether the &quot;Truncated SchemeTI as at present devised meetsthe criticisms which might be levelled both by the advocates of a full development of the Base and by those who are infavour of abandoning the scheme altogether aThe Prime Minister has formulated certain detailedquestions as to this aspect of the caso,  falling under two main headslo    STRATEGICAX.(a) Vi/hat is the most recent view of Coast Defence -  in relation to the Singapore Base?(b) /
(b )    VJhat definite problem would have to be jfaeed, as regards the nature of the action which would have to bo taken in the evsnt of war breaking out and Singapore being the centre either of offence or defence?And, however, remote or doubtful to some j, of our minds it may be, we cannot overlookaltogether this further question -(a) What would be the kind of Singapore Base required if the first-class battleship was materially reduced in size or even ceased to exist?(d)   How far could a Naval Base at Singapore be utilised for commerce and what modification would be required so that the docks might be available to the fullest extent for com-mercial ships?smOTGiGAJio(a) The whole system of Coast Defence is under consideration consequent on recent Coast Defence firings * In the meantime, the Chiefs of Staff have recommended that a Squadron of Torpedo Bombers should be based on the port in order that the present works, oil fuel reserves, etc, should not be entirely unprotected, and on the assumption that the first stage of the programme of   work for light guns and anti-aircraft defences is not to be interrupted5(b) It is considered that the scale of developmentof Singapore is independent of the question whether Singapore is the centre either of offence or defence.    If war breaks out. Hong Kong and Singapore are both threatened.)    The defences of Kong Kong could not withstand attack beyond a limited time and must therefore depend finally on the JTleeto    The Jieet depends upon a base at Singapore sufficiently strong to with-stand attack until its arrival.    In addition,  the Singapore Base must be strong enough to afford temporary protection to our merchant ships in JJastera waters before the arrival of our Meet.
fc)    IS all Capital Ships were to &quot;be scrapped within tho nest few years, the existing commercial docking facilities at Singaporej in conjunction with the Admiralty floating Dock, would he sufficient, assuming that tho abolition of the Capital Ship resulted in a proportionate redaction in global tonnageoA more reduction in the si ye of battleships, however, would not affect the necessity for having two docks (Admiralty floating and Graving Docks) in addition to existing facilities, nor could the size of the Graving Deck be reduce1 owing to the probability of the lives of existing Capital Ships being extended.CJ^O^CJAL.If andwhen the 3aso is completed in accordance with the &quot;Truncated Scheme&quot;, it will be oquipped with a large floating Dock, a large Graving Dock, up-to-date workshops, transport and handling facilities, together with berthing accommodation alongside for vessels tmdergoiiig repairsCertain modifications would be required in order to reduce tho cost of docking charges and so attract commercial work.    The modifications to the -Floating Dock would be slight0 Those to the Graving Dock would be more e-i tensive and would include the provision of a spare caisson   so as to divide the dock to suit the sixe of the merchant vesselo  (See Appendix II)*The probability of obtaining commercial work is indicated by the Report of the Imperial Shipping Committee on the Harbour of Singapore of May, 1929,  in which the suggestion of the Harbour Board that one or more Dry Docks should he eon-strueted at a future date is viewed in the light of possible commercial facilities being obtainable from the Admiralty.. The conclusion reached was - &quot;that the combined facilities offered by the present commercial docks and the Uaval docks should be amply sufficient to meet all normal demands for at least the nest 10 yearsc&quot;In /
. 277In normal times naval requirements would, not be large and it would be possible to deal with a considerable amount of commercial work.   Much would necessarily depend upon the development of Eastern trade in the future..general  COHOLUSlOxUIn the light of the above considerations it is held that the &quot;Truncated So home&quot; (modified as indicated in Appendix II) represents the minimum scope and   rate of development necessary to meet the requirements of Imperial strategy in the Jar East, and that, apart from this - the most Important aspect of the matter - the Singapore Base so constructed could be utilised for commercial work.
A P P. E S D I Z     II.PROPOSED MOD IPI CATIONS TO THE SCHEME POR SIHGAPORE BASS.:?IITA1CIAL    STATSMT.jitA*    Curtailment of the Truncated Scheme.The estimates for the 1 truncated11 scheme have previously heew reviowed hy the Board and as they stand represent the minimum expenditure for giving effect to that scheme, which makes   provision for the works in the completed scheme which would, take more than 8 years to complete, and in addition certain, items necessary in order to use the base in peace time.As regards the first part of the Ttruhbated1 scheme policy, namely thofee Works which would take more than 8 years to complete, no suggestions for economy can he madeIn regard to the second part, however, namely,  the provision of certain facilities do as to enable the &quot;base to he used in peace time, when the original review of the *truncatedI scheme was undertaken the indications were that the battle cruiser squadron would be held in readiness to proceed to Eastern Waters from 1929 onwards.   It now seems probable that there will be no increase in our China Squadron for 30me years to come, and on this understanding certain items originally included in the 1 truncated1  scheme,  to meet the requirements of a fleet including a squadron of heavy ships,  can be deferred.The principal curtailment will be represented hy a 20$ reduction in dockyard workshops.    Other deferments proposed are consequent on the reduction in these workshops.    Suoh reduction will still allow the floating dock and graving dock to be used, hut not to the extent contemplated under the 1 truncated1  scheme.If /

^* -  Commercial use of the Singapore Base *Under the 1 truncated1&apos; scheme facilities for commercial work will he available at the base and these will compare favourably with the facilities of local firms *The docks themselves are, however, large for the ordinary sise merchant ship and in order that the economic charges for docking shall not be greater than those of the ordinary commercial dock companies,  certain alterations designed to dispense with breast shores would be necessary., These would cost  4,-000 for each dockoIn the case of the graving dock alone it would further be desirable to reduce the cost of pumping by adjusting the length of the dock to the length of the ship to be dockedo    The best method of doing this,  taking into consideration the varied tonnage of commercial ships, would be the provision of -two intermediate caisson stops in the length of the dock, and the construction of one spare caisson.The ostra cost of the above alterations isestimated as followsSliding Bilge Blocks floating deck       * *  4.000Sliding Bilge Blocks graving clock  4,000Additional work to body of graving dock (Stops, -Culverts, Penstock shafts) * oc 8o,&apos;000Spare Ciasson .. o . . . .................... f. 82j 000A/ ote 8 machinery o e a * o .*...* c .... o l2, 0C0Total..c 183;000Apart from the docks,  commercial use may be ms.de of the store, basin and oiling wharf at which 3-500 foot berths are available for the discharge and embarkation of cargo provided these berths are not occupied for naval purposeguIf,  /
If, as a re suit of affording these facilities, discharge and embarkation of commercial cargoes takes place ..cn any scale,  it will probably be found necessary to build one or more of additional transit sheds at the cost for each shod of  00,000cGo    General Rem8,rk^oIt will he seen from the above that the total saving&apos;possible on the 1 truncatedT  scheme &quot;without rendering nugatory the construction of the floating and graving dock&quot; is estimated at  393,000.The ex tent to which the improved facilities at the Singapore Naval Base will attract commercial work is difficult to gauge.    It will depend primarily on a favourable comparison of the Admiralty charges as against those of local firms*If commercial facilities are to be provided the cost of installing these will be at least  183,000 and will be about  378,000 if cargoes are handled and an additional transit shed is necessaryaIf further transit sheas,  together with additional cranes arid transport facilities are required,  the expenditure would approach the figure cf  333, 000 which it is estimated, might be saved by curtailment of the truncated scheme,,    Ho estimate is attempted as to the period within which it should be possible to recover &quot;by means of docking charges the extra outlay involvedaIt may be added that none of these variations in expenditure would arise before .1931 ^
