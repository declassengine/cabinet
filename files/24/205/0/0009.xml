S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.COPY no&apos;. 3CABINET.THE UNITED STATES TARIFF,Memorandum by the President of the Board of TraderI am afraid I must ask my colleagues for an immediate decision on this matter.Colonel Howard-Bury has addressed to me the following question:-&quot;To ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he vail get in touch with Foreign Ministers of Labour and Commerce in Europe and discuss the possibility of the formation of an economic United States of Europe as the only means of fighting the high American Tariff&quot;.I have asked Colonel Howard-Bury to postpone his question as I am anxious to consult my colleagues on the important question of policy which is involved.    They will be aware from statements that have appeared in the Press that a movement is on foot on the continent, in which the lead has been taken by France, the object of which is to range European countries together in a common effort against the high tariffs of the United States.   Whilst the Economic Conference held at Geneva two years ago passed resolutions in favour of a general lowering of Customs Tariffs, very little in the form of definite results has been achieved, and it has been frequently represented that this is due to a large extent to the fact that European countries do not feel disposed to reduce their tariffs so long as the benefit of any reduction must automatically be accorded under existing Commercial Treaties to the United States, a country which already imposes high duties on European goods and which under the new tariff Bill(29)
now before the United Stores Legislature proposes still further to increase them.    Proposals have accordingly been put forward, so far in a very tentative fashion, that European countries should endeavour to come to some arrange-ment amongst themselves by which reduction of duty accorded to each other should be withheld from any country -which like the United States refuses to reduce its duties to a similar level.    It is not unlikely that some more concrete scheme on these lines may be brought forward shortly for the considera-tion of the Economic organisation of the League of Hations.So far no indication has been given of the view that His Majesty&apos;s Government would take of any proposals of this character.- It is, however, to my mind very desirable that both the continent of Europe and the United Spates should be left in no doubt as to our attitude.    Whilst the American tariff which is now under consideration will undoubtedly be more protective than ever, there can be no question that we ought to indicate with the utmost clearness that we can be no parties to a policy which seeks to discriminate between different foreign countries and more particularly that we should not in any case be prepared to adopt a policy of discrimination against the United Spates.    We could, of course, only associate ourselves with foreign countries in this matter if we were prepared in the first instance to denounce our Coramercial Treaty with the United States, which expressly guarantees mutual most-favoured-nation treatment,-a Treaty   &apos;.whioh has now stood for more than 100 years.    Any such action on our part would be of the nature of the declaration of a tariff war, a war which could not fail to have the moot disastrous economic results, and it is, of course, especially inexpedient in view of the discussions which have begun with America involving larger political
iosues that we should take any action which could be regarded as specifically directed against that country.In all the circumstances I a,m anxious to make it clear aig, soon as possible what our attitude would be to such a proposal and I would accordingly suggest that the opportunity might be taken to reply to Colonel Howard-Bury in the following terms&quot;I do not see my way to act on the suggestion of the Hon. and Gallant Member.    I may add that His Majesty&apos;a Government have no intention of proposing or entering into any foreign engagement under which they might be required to discriminate against the United States of America&quot;.W.G.Board of Trade15th July,  1929.
