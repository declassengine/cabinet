THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.* ^SECRET. No.,j   ^CP.216(29) .RATING. VALUATION OP RAILWAYS. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I submit for the consideration of my colleagues a Memorandum on the question of legislation dealing with the valuation of Railways for rating purposes.     In my opinion there 1b a clear need for the Introduction of a Bill in the Autumn, and I understand that the Minister of Transport and the Secretary of State for Scotland take the same view.     In the circumstances described in the Memorandum such a Bill as is suggested may, I think, reasonably be expected to prove substantially uncontroverslal.A.G.18th July,  1929
Rating. Valuation of Railways.Legislation is necessary in order to place on a satisfactory statutory basis the valuation for rating purposes of hereditaments in the occupation of Railway Companies According to the theory of the present law, railway hereditaments have to be valued parochially.     On that basis, a complete re-valuation of the railways would involve the making of separate valuations by nearly all of the 179 5 separate Rating Authorities and 373 Assessment Committees, based on separate estimates of the proportion of the earnings of each of the Companies attributable to the sections of their undertakings in each parish through which their lines runIn praotice no re-valuation of railways has taken place since the War, and both the Companies and the Associations of Looal Authorities realize the practical impossibility of a general re^.valuation of the railway systems covering England and Wales on the paroehial basis.Sinoe 1921 the pre-War assessments of railway properties (lines, stations and other premises) outside London have been adjusted from time to time in pursuance of agreements centrally negotiated between representatives of the Companies and the Local Authorities,  the latter having for the last two years been represented by the Central Valuation Committee. These agreements, which have come to be known as &quot;transitory previsions&quot;, have in effect provided for the adjustment of the pre-War assessments of individual railway properties throughout the country by a percentage calculated from
a comparison of the net receipts of each company in 1913 with the average net receipts for a period of post-war years. It is hardly necessary to point out.the unsatisfactory nature of such an expedient,  if unduly prolonged;     Apart from the absence of any statutory basis, the assessments which fall to be adjusted were made at varying dates, many of them were obsolete even in 1914, and all of them are becoming more remotely related to the facts, and therefore less reliable as a ba3is of rating,  with the passage of time.     The need for a general re-valuation of railway   hereditaments is accentuated by the general re-valuation of all other classes of hereditament which has recently taken place.The parochial principle as applied to the valuation of railways has been condemned on many occasions by the Courts and by various Commissions and Committees.In 1922 a Departmental Committee (consisting of representatives of the Ministries of Health and Transport, the English and Scottish Eating Authorities, and the Railway Companies) reported, in connexion wife problems arising out of the amalgamation of railways situated partly in England and partly in Scotland,  that it was an essential preliminary to any permanent solution of the difficulty that the railways in England and Wales should be valued in cumulo,  and that the total valuation so ascertained should be apportioned among the Rating Areas upon some plan to be centrally determined,    (in Scotland the valuation of railways has been made on the oumuJo principle ever since 185 5) .
7. Clauses were subsequently inserted in the Rating and valuation Bill of 192 5, providing for (a) the application of the cumulo principle and (b)  the establishment of a Railway Assessment Authority.     Owing to pressure of time, these clauses were dropped in Standing Committee.     The Minister of Health explained at the time that it was the intention to re-introduce the provisions in a separate Bill.8. Subsequent examination of the clauses by the LocalAuthorities and the Companies disclosed some disagreement on points of detail, and negotiations were instituted between representatives of the companies and the Local Authorities (outside London), which eventually resulted in an agreement and the formulation, for the consideration of the Government, of a draft Bill designed to give effect to it.   The London Authorities were subsequently consulted and accepted the principles embodied in the draft Bill subject to certain supplementary provisions which were acbepted by the other two parties.9. The main features of the proposals which have been formulated by the Companies and Local Authorities are -(i) The constitution of a Railway Assessment Authority,with a paid Chairman possessing legal qualifications and members nominated by the representative Associations of Local Authorities,  the expenses of the body to be apportioned among Local Authorities and defrayed out of rates.(ii)    The making of quinquennial valuations In cumulo of each railway undertaking and the allocation of a proportion of the total to the individual railway hereditaments in
each parish   in accordance with a schemer-of^apporticnment to be submitted to the Minister-of &quot;Health and confirmed by him (with or without modification), subject to any address moved in. either House. Hli-iJ-^Definitions of railway undertakings and of the net receipts to be taken into account.(iv) Provisions as to ascertainment of rateable value from net reoeipts.(v) Provisions for appeal from the. decision of the Railway Assessment Authority to the Railway and Canal Commission and thence to the Court of Appeal and House of Lords.10/ As two out of the four amalgamated Railways - the L.M.&amp; S* and the L.H.E. - are partly in Scotland and partly in England, special provisions will be necessary, in the case of those two companies, for dividing between England and Scotland the net receipts which will form the basis of the separate valuations on which rates will be leviable in the two countries.     It is proposed, as a result of inter-departmental conference, that the Bill should provide for an examination and division of the reoeipts of the two Anglo-Scottish railways by a small joint body consisting of the Chairman of, and one other member to be appointed by, the English Railway Assessment Authority and the Scottish Assessor of Railways and. Canals, with appeal from their deoision to the Railway and Canal Commission with a Scottish Judge sitting and thence to the House of Lords.11. Having regard to the large measure of agreement that has been reached between the representative Associations of Local Authorities and the Companies, a Bill following the general lines of the proposals submitted should prove substantially uncontroversial.     Such criticism as may arise will, it may be expected, come from individual Local Authorities, particularly some of the Rural Districts, who will be specially interested in the basis of distribution of the cumulo valuation and its effect on their rateable
1 3 9 X t) civalue.     It i3. contemplated, as explained in paragraph 9, that the apportionment of the cumulo valuation should be determined by a scheme to be prepared by the Railway Authority and confirmed by the Minister of Health, and it is proposed to enable County Valuation Committees, the London County Council and the Railway Companies to lodge objections to the schema in draft.     In these circumstances, and in view of the opportunity for discussion on a motion for an address in either House, it is thought that Parliamentary criticism directed to the question of apportionment should not create special difficulty.Suggestions have been made by the London and provincial rating authorities and the Companies that the Bill should formulate certain principles for the guidance of the Railway Assessment Authority viz* - (a) that the next annual value of the indirectly productive portions of a railway undertaking shall have regard inter alia to the value for railway purposes of the land occupied and to the structures erected thereon and (b) that the net annual value of the directly productive portions shall have regard, inter alia, to the estimated quantum of traffic thereon.(The expression &quot;directly productive portions&quot; to be defined to mean such lines of railway as are used for the primary purpose of earning receipts - inoluding such parts of the hereditament as are neoessary for the physical working of such lines - the remainder being deemed to be the &quot;indirectly productive portions&quot;. )It will be a matter for consideration by Parliamentary Counsel, if authority to prepare a Bill is given, whether these suggestions can be embodied in provisions which are definite enough to give guidance as to the basis of the scheme.
12.Strong representations have been made to the Department hy the Central Valuation Committee, by the Associations of Local Authorities and by the Companies as to the urgent need for legislation and the late Minister of Health intimated to both parties that it was recognised that the matter was one which would need to be dealt with early in the life of the new Parliament.
