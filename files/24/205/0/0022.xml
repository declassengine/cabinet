v&apos; &apos;  145HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVERNMENT.JCRET. COPY NO.    S-^,p, 222(29).CABINET.PROGRAMME OF LEGISLATIONt    MINISTRY OF HEALTH.   . Memorandum by the Minister of Health.The following is a list of bills under consideration in the Ministry of Health for the 1929-30 Session of Parliament. (1)   Widows, Orphans &amp; Old Age Contributory Pensions. (2)   Railway rating, (see CP. 216(29)). (3)   Slum clearance and town planning of built up areas. (4)   Lunacy. (5)   London Squares.(6)   Superannuation of Local Government employees. (7)   One consolidation bill, in pursuance of the programme . of consolidation of the various sets of acts regulating various departments of local government.In addition to the above measures there is a bill dealing with the position, of the Clerks of the Peace and of County Councils, which Is being submitted to the Cabinet,  (C.P.225(29)), with the proposal that facilities should be given by the Government for its passage into law.(1)   Pensions should be put on the Statute Book as early as possible after Parliament reassembles in order that payment of the new pensions may begin as from 1st January, 1930,   A separate memorandum on the Bill is being submitted to the Cabinet and, subject to their approval of the proposals being given before the holidays, the Bill should be ready for the Home Affairs Committee at the beginning of October, for publication before the House meets and for Second Reading early in November,- 1 -
The position as to (2), Railway Rating, is much the same - it is hoped to have the Bill ready for introduction early in November,     The terms of it have been agreed for England and Wales by those concerned and it is a question of the Parliamentary Draughtsman finding time to put the draft Bill into shape.(3)   Slums and town planning of built up areas - the contents of this Bill will not be ready fcr^ Cabinet consideration till after the holidays and it can probably not be introduced&apos; until a considerably later- date- than the two preceding Bills. In view of its importance I am strongly of opinion that it must be taken on the floor of the House.   I do not propose to include in it any proposals as to housing as distinguished from slum clearance.(4)   Lunacy - Is a short Bill embodying some of the main recommendations of the Lunacy Royal Commission appointed by the Labour Government in 1924, and presided over by Mr, H.P. Macmlllan.     It is thought that this Bill could be introduced in the Lords, possibly by Earl Russell, who was a member of the Royal Commission, and I should endeavour to have it ready for introduction in November,(5)   London Squares - is a Bill based on the recommendations of a Royal Commission for the passing of which there is considerable public demand.(6)   Superannuation - is a Bill making jmperannukt I on of employees of local authorities compulsory on all authorities and is based on the report of a Departmental Committee&apos; of which I was a member.     These two Bills and a consolidation bill (7) would be brought forward at the convenient time next year.The Prime Minister&apos;s memorandum C.P* 217(29) proposes to take among other measures early In the Autumn Session a
Bill amending Unemployment Insurance,   This is, I presume, the Bill which will deal, inter alia, with the situation arising in respect of the limitation of unemployment benefit to those who have paid at least thirty contributions.   If so, I^think it right to warn the Cabinet that this question raises most formidable difficulties and that I have grave doubts whether we shall have arrived at the stage of a Bill as soon as the Prime Minister seems to anticipate.A.G.22nd July, 1929.
