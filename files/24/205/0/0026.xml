IX)CCMBNT IS THE PROPERTY of1 HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 3 GOvERMvOiNT. C.P.226(29).CABINET. LUNACY   LEGISLATION. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I. I ask the approval of. the Cabinet to the introduction of a short Mental Treatment Bill giving effect to&apos;some of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Lunacy,  which wa3 appointed under the Chairmanship of Mr. H.P. Macmillan during the last Labour Government and reported in 1926cThe Report (Gmd0 2700) recoupended far-reaching alterations in the&apos;Lunacy Law and proposed that--the code? should be re-cast for this purpose.     Sinoe the issue of the Report, the legislative implications have been worked out in detail by the Ministry of Health;    and it is&apos; apparent that to give effect to all the recommendations of the Royal Commission whether by a complete new code or by an amending Bill would involve a measure of great length and complexity which would have little chance of passing in the present state of Parliamentary business, having regard to the controversial nature of this subject.A selection has accordingly been made of the provisions which are most urgently needed to effect improve-ments in Lunacy administration and are likely to &quot;be the least controversial.II. The provisions which I should propose to includejLnjthe.. Bill are as follows
(1) Extended facilities for early treatment without certification.(a) Provision to enable Public Mental Hospitals to admit m voluntary boarders.(b) Provision to enable Local Authorities to provide out-patient Clinics.(c) Provision for treatment for fix months of incipient non-volitional oases without certification.[(c) is included tentatively.     The proposals would not follow the lines of the Provisional Treatment Order recommended &quot;by the Royal Commission which would in fact be indistinguishable from certification and offer no real advance in the treatment of this type of oaae.](2) Extension to rate-aided patients of urgency order procedure. nJeiw.available for&quot; prXvatepatients only.(3) Visiting Committees.(a) New powers in regard to (i) research, (ii) after-care,(b) Requirement that at least two women shall be members. (4) Board of ^Controlt -(a) Reorganisation of the Board.(b) Substitution of approval of Board.for approval of Minister in a number of routine matters, to save duplication of work.(o) Provision to enable one commissioner of the Board to carry out visits for which two Commissioners are now required under the Lunacy Act.(5) Protection of Certifying Dotftogs.This would be an amendment of Section 330 of the Lunacy Act, 189a, fallowing the preolse wording recommended by the Royal, Commission.III.        The principal rec^^snd&amp;tl^n&amp;^of the Reya^-^osB^ffli^nwhich are not covered fcy tha proposed Bill are:-(a) Assimilation of prooedure for the certification of rate-aided find private cases c     This would involve a long and complicated amendment of the Aot.     The object of the Commission4s recommendation was to simplify the law and particularly to extricate Lunacy administration from the Poor Law;   but the latter is largely effected by the Local
Government Act, 1929, and the transfer of Poor Law functions to Local Authorities.(b) Licensed Houses:   This was the most controversial issue with which the Commission had to deal and they were evenly divided in their recommendations.     The inclusion of suoh a matter in the Bill now proposed would. I fear, destroy its chances of passing. XV.        If my colleagues agree in principle to the introduction of a Bill on the lines suggested in II above, it would be a short useful measure giving effect to some urgent reforms long overdue, and would, I believe, command a large measure of agreement in Parliament.   A draft could be ready for the consideration of the Home Affairs Committee at a very early date.     I would suggest that the Bill might be introduced in the House of Lords in the autumn by Lord Russell (who was a member of the Royal Commission).     It will be recollected that in 1923 the House of Lords passed a Mental Treatment Bill, which included several provisions similar to those now proposed.A.G.22nd July, 1929.
