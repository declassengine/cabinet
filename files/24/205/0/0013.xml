1 ? o lidTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY, OF BIS BRITANN10 MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.SECRET. Copy Ho.     30. P. 235/29PROPOSED ROADWAY AND TUNNEL FROM BERKELEY SQUARE TO THE MALI. Memorandum by the First Commiesloner of Works.From the point of view of the First Commissioner of Works as Custodian of the Royal Parks it must be said at onoe that the proposal is distinctly unwelcome and is one which, under normal conditions, he would oppose to the utmost of his power.    These Parks are a very precious heritage to the people of London.    The central Royal Parks, whioh are so splendidly situated,  are in particular a priceless boon.    There is probably no other oity in the world whioh possesses anything comparable to them and they are the envy of every foreigner.    The Green Park, which is the area affected by the proposal, has a distinctive charm of its own from its unadorned sylvan character.The first proposal put forward by the Ministry, under which the tunnel was to come out abruptly into the Park quite cIobs to Piccadilly, was one which the First Commissioner quite frankly could not contemplate.    It would completely spoil the whole eastern side of the Park. The alternative, under which the tunnel would come out nearer the Mall,  is less objectionable.    It would not so much disfigure the northern part of the Park, except for the loss of trees, which will be referred to later,  and it would much curtail the length of the new roadway proposed to be opened for vehicles.    Incidentally,  it would considerably lessen the objection which might be raised to the scheme on the score of the detrimental effect of the proposed roadway on the amenities of the houses along this side of the Park.When
When all tills is said in favour of thealternative scheme the fact still remains, however, that the First Commissioner must regard any such interference with this beautiful open space with the gravest misgiving. Even under the modified scheme the Park would be disfigured by the open mouth of a tunnel, and whero there is now -but a stretch of quiet footpath shaded by trees there would be a broad roadway over which would run a constant stream of fast-moving traffic.It is understood that the tunnel would be constructed by the &quot;cut and cover&quot; method and not by        ^1tunnelling underneath,  and the result would be^mads hideous for perhaps a year by building operations.    The construction of the tunnel would, moreover, involve the sacrifice of no less than eleven fine trees, which can never be replaced, since,  on account of the levels,  the depth of the soil between the surface and the roof of the tunnel would be only aDout two feet.permanently euffer from the loss of trees,  the presence of the tunnel mouth vent-holes and the diminution of the area of open space resulting from the presence of the new stretch of roadway opened out for wheeled traffic.of the Park is not measured merely by the area covered by that roadway.    The opening out of even a comparatively short stretch of such roadway must push still further back the region of quietude where people can enjoy comparative freedom from noise and dust and petrol fumes.    Consequently under the most favourable conditions the tunnel and the roadway must result In robbing the public of valuable amenities now enjoyed by those who use the Park.    It may be, however,  that the loss of these amenities would be compensated for   by great advantages to the community inThis part of the park would, therefore,The extent of the encroachment on the amenitiesother
Othei- aii^eo-blCThey  wM ir trie- ifaopcre of the  Cabinet take the view that the need for giving freer outlet for traffic is so overwhelmingly urgent as to justify an encroachment on the Park,  the First Commissioner will, of course, not be in a position to dissent from that decision.He must, however, warn his colleagues that even Jthe modified scheme, if adopted,  is bound to give rise to vehement protests from many quarters when the details are made public.    It may be taken as certain that opposition to the proposal will be organised by societies and individuals interested in such matters.    The Office of Works has recently had experience of the amount of feeling which is aroused by any kind of interference with the Parks.    A few years ago it v/as decided, after prolonged discussion,  to allow a slice of Kensington Gardens to be thrown into the roadway in connection with a scheme for widening the whole of the High Street by a gradual setting back of the buildings. This sacrifice of a small part of the Park was most reluctantly agreed to by the Department in order to help a muoh needed improvement.    The area agreed to be surrendered was only about three-eighths of an acre.   When the proposal was made public many protests appeared in the Press,  and the First Commissioner of the day had to defend the Department&apos;s action in a debate in the House of Lords in July 1926.    It may be of interest to mention that in the course of his speech Lord Peel said that by agreeing to this small sacrifice as part of a great through traffic improvement in London the Department was really put in a better position to resist &quot;Philistines&quot; who press for great roads in the Parks.If the Cabinet decide in favour of the scheme the matter will, of course, have to be submitted to the King as Ranger and to Parliament.There
There is one important reservation which the First Commissioner considers it absolutely essential to make if it is decided to adopt the scheme.    The present intention is that the tunnel is to be used only by private cars and taxi cabs, but it is understood that it is being constructed large enough to take omnibuses and other large vehicles.    There is a distinct danger that this may lead to an agitation at some future time that all kinds of traffic shall be allowed to use the tunnel.    The First Commissioner considers that this should be safeguarded against by a clause in the Bill for promoting the scheme, providing that the tunnel shall be used only for the lighter kind of traffic.    This would ensure that further legislation will be required in the future if there is to be any departure from what is the present intention.19th July, 1929.
