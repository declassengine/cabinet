COMMITTEE OF civil RESEARCH.SEVERN BARRAGE SUB-COMMITTEE.Second Interim Report.I,-Introductory.1. At their meeting held on the 12th October, 1925 (C.R./9th Meeting, Conclusion 6), the Committee of Civil Research considered the question of, the steps to be taken in regard to an enquiry into the practicability of a Severn Barrage, which had been referred to them by the Cabinet (44 (25), Conclusion 4), and decided that this question should be referred to the following Sub-committee :-Lieut.-Colonel J. T. C. Moore-Brabazon, M.C., M.P., late Parlia-mentary Secretary, Ministry of Transport (Chairman);Sir J. R. Brooke, Secretary, Ministry of Transport;Mr. R.  S.  Meiklejohn,  C.B.,  Deputy Controller of Supply Services, Treasury;Mr. P. W. L. Ashley, C.B., Principal Assistant Secretary, Board of Trade;Rear-Aclmiral FT. P. Douglas, C.B., C.M.G., Ilydrographer of the Navy, Admiralty ;Sir John Snell, G.B.E., Chairman, Electricity Commission:Professor A. II.

II. Result op the First Stage of the Investigation.3. In our First Keport we summarised our recommendations as follows : (a.) The Sub-Committee are satisfied that a prima facie case has been established for the further expenditure of public money on the prosecution of the enquiry.(b.) The Sub-Committee recommend that the Ministry of Trans-port should be the Department on whose Vote the expenses involved in that first stage of the enquiry should be charged.(c.) The Sub-Committee recommend that the following provision should be made for the cost of the first part of the investigation : (1.) An Appropriation-in-Aid of Navy Votes in recoup-ment of the cost of marine survey by the Hydrographic Department. The total estimated cost is  23,400, exclu-sive of the cost of the tide gauges referred to in (2) below, and on the same basis the sum required for 1926-27 is  15,400.(2.) Purchase of tide gauges for use by the Hydro-graphic Department for the purposes of the marine survey :  600.(3.) Survey of the English Stones by aerial photo-graphy :  950.(4.) Construction of a model and its experimental working for one year :  3,000.(5.) Out-of-pocket expenses, and possible fee for Civil Engineer engaged to visit the proposed site of the Barrage : 500 guineas ( 525).(d.) The total cost of the first stage of the enquiry is therefore estimated at  5,075, in addition to the cost of the marine survey by the Admiralty, which, though amounting to  23,400, will, for the reasons explained in Section IV of this Eeport, constitute no net increased charge on public funds.4. These recommendations were supported by the Committee of Civil Research and approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In accordance with the recommendation in Section VIII of that Eeport, the Chairman of the Committee of Civil Research appointed an Expert Co-ordinating Sub-Committee to undertake the immediate superintendence of the first stage of the investigations. This Sub-Committee was composed in the first instance of : Sir John Snell (Chairman), Mr. Basil Mott, Professor A. PI. Gibson,with Mr. Shirley Hawkins, Harbour Engineer, Ministry of Trans-port, as Secretary. Later, Eear-Admiral Douglas was appointed an additional member of this body.5. The Expert Co-ordinating Sub-Committee has submitted two Interim Reports, the First in January 1928, and the Second in March 1929.6. The first stage of the investigations, which has now been completed, comprised : (a) the carrying out of the surveys and investigations requiredto furnish the necessary technical data;(b) experimental examination of the effect of a Barrage on con-ditions in the Estuary and the probable effect on naviga-tion, riparian and other interests;(c) the determination of the character of the foundations at the site proposed for the Barrage.
The first and third of these investigations have been accomplished by the elaborate survey of the English Stones carried out by the Department of the Hydrographer of the Navy. The information required under the second head has been obtained by the eonstruc-tion and working of a tidal model of the Severn Estuary. This part of the investigation has been carried out by Professor Gibson, who has submitted to us a number of extremely interesting and instructive reports. The tides since 1849 up to the present date have been reproduced on the model without a barrage. The contour of the J?ed of the Severn thus obtained on the model coincides to a remark-able degree with that actually disclosed by the recent Admiralty survey. We concur, therefore, with the view of the Co-ordinating Expert Sub-Committee that it is fair to assume that the results obtained on the model with a barrage at the English Stones may be regarded as representing substantially the conditions which would obtain in the estuary if a barrage were constructed. After carefully examining the work done on the model, the Co-ordinating Expert Sub-Committee conclude that on the assumption that the results obtained by model can be accepted as giving a fair indication of the results that would be obtained in nature, a Barrage (a) would not injuriously affect navigation below the Barrage;(b) would not seriously affect navigation above the Barrage atany time, and would improve it at times of low water;(c) would reduce the effect of inundations in the Upper Estuarydue to floods in the Severn or Wye;(d) would not injuriously affect the question of sewage disposal.7. The reasons on which the Expert Sub-Committee base these conclusions, with which we concur, are set out in their Second Report, which is attached to this Report as an Appendix.8. Finally, the Expert Sub-Committee have had the advantage of a detailed Report from a firm of Consulting Engineers of the highest standing, Messrs. Coode, Wilson, Mitchell and Vaughan-Lee. This firm, for a nominal fee of 500 guineas, has prepared a preliminary scheme and drawings for the construction of a Barrage at the English Stones. After reviewing the whole of the geological and other evidence placed at their disposal by the Expert Sub-Com-mittee, the Consulting Engineers have expressed themselves as confident that a Barrage constructed on the general lines indicated in their report &quot; would be capable of satisfactory execution.&quot;III. x\ction Recommended.9. The first stage of the investigations conducted during the last three years may now be regarded as completed. Without doubt, they point to a favourable conclusion regarding the practicability of constructing a Severn Barrage, and to the advantages that would accrue therefrom. These advantages would include not only electrical development on a very large scale but also road and rail access across the Estuary. They are, in our view, amply sufficient to justify His Majesty&apos;s Government in authorising the second stage of the investigations. When the scheme of investigation was first drawn up, it was contemplated that the second stage should consist of the preparation of a complete tidal power scheme with estimates (o) of the total capital cost on the basis of the data obtained during the first stage of the enquiry, and (b) of the total amount of electricity that might be expected to be generated.10. At that time it was anticipated that this stage would require (a) the appointment of a Civil Engineer and of a Hydro-ElectricEngineer to prepare the scheme in collaboration; and(b) the appointment of a Water-works or Water-power Engineerto advise on the subject of the high-level reservoir. [19404] b 2
11.   In the light of the experience so far gained, we suggest the following modifications for the second stage, namely : (a.) We do not now think it is necessary to appoint a Hydro-Electric Engineer. The better course would, we believe, be to re-appoint the present Consulting Engineers and to authorise them to open direct communication with a number of specified manufacturing firms in regard to the nature and cost of the plant which would be required. The firms we have in mind are turbine manufacturers and electrical machinery manufacturers, and sluice manu-facturers.(b.) It does not now appear that there will be a need for a high-level reservoir, and the appointment of a Water-works Engineers will therefore not be necessary. This reservoir was originally intended for levelling out the intermittent and variable output of electricity due to the large difference in the range of spring, mean and neap tides. We now anticipate that the &apos;&apos; grid &apos;&apos; will render such storage unnecessary, and in this respect we would point out that one of the great values of the &quot;grid,&quot; so far as any tidal power scheme is concerned, is that it will enable the whole of the electrical energy generated by the tide to be used; none will have to be taken for the purpose of pumping up water to a high level reservoir to enable subsidiary turbines to be worked in order that a continuous supply of electricity may be maintained.12. So far as we can estimate, we judge that the second stage should be completed in about two years. The main item of expen-diture would be the fee payable to the Consulting Engineers. That firm have stated that if they were asked to undertake the second stage it would be necessary for them to obtain a number of tentative and comparative estimates involving collaboration with turbine, electrical machinery, and sluice manufacturers; to prepare a large number of drawings and to make a long series of calculations of quantities; and that it would be necessary for them to prepare final drawings sufficient to enable accurate quantities to be obtained, though these drawings would not be in as completely finished detail as would be required for contract purposes. They have intimated that the cost of undertaking this work, including remuneration for their firm, would probably amount to . 10,000, but that their actual charge would be based on their book entries, which might work out either somewhat less or somewhat more than that figure.13. As regards the proposed consultations with manufacturers, we do not consider that it would be reasonable to expect, or possible to obtain, the desired information without paying a fee to the firms consulted. In particular, we consider it essential that the selected firms should be required to guarantee the design for, and the output from, the machines submitted. We base our opinion on the con-siderable out-of-pocket expenses which the firms would have to incur, and the comparatively slight prospect that they would have of obtaining any orders for such machinery, at any rate for a con-siderable number of years. We estimate that provision of  3,500 should be made to cover such fees, though we are hopeful that by negotiation it may be possible to avoid spending so large a sum.14. During the second stage we consider that it is essential that arrangements should be made to maintain and operate the model, as it will be required for a number of experiments on par-ticular problems for which the Consulting Engineers will require answers during the preparation of their designs. In addition, it will be necessary to construct a large-scale model of the turbine dam. We anticipate that the sum of  2,000 should cover the cost of these services for the duration of the second stage.15. In submitting the foregoing estimates, we desire to make it clear that there may be expenditure which we cannot at present foresee. . We think that provision for  1,500 should be made to cover contingencies of this kind.
16. The total cost of the second stage of the investigations should therefore, we estimate, be placed at  17,000. This stage, should, we think, be completed in approximately two years, and the expenditure required would presumably fall to be distributed over three financial years.17. We anticipate that if our recommendations are adopted it should be possible at the end of the second stage for us to submit: (a.) A considered Report and drawings for a complete scheme, comprising : (i.) Sluice dam and sluices.(ii.) Turbine dam, turbines and electrical machinery, (iii.) Locks and bridges, (iv.) Railway and road viaducts, (v.) Embankment and closing of the &quot; Shoots,&quot; i.e., . the deep water channel next to the &apos;&apos; English Stones.&quot;(b.) An estimate of the cost of the works indicated in (a) above.(c.) An estimate of the amount of the electricity that may be expected to be produced at the Barrage and the methods by which the electricity so generated may be absorbed by the National &apos;&apos; Grid &apos;&apos; now in course of construction by the Central Electricity Board.IV. Summary op Conclusions and Recommendations.18. Eor the convenience of the Committee of Civil Research we summarise our conclusions as follows :-(a.) In view of the Report of the Consulting Engineers vie are satisfied regarding the practicability of constructing a Barrage across the Severn Estuary at the English Stones.(b.) The contour of the bed of the Severn obtained on the Model without a Barrage coincides to a remarkable degree with that actually disclosed by the survey recently carried out by the Hydrographer of the Navy.(c.) In view of (b) above, it is fair to assume that the results obtained by the Model can be accepted as giving a fair indication of the results that would be obtained in nature, and that a Barrage : (i) would not injuriously affect navigation below the Barrage;(ii) would not seriously affect navigation above the Barrage at any time, and would improve it at times of lowwater;(iii) would reduce the effect of inundations in the Upper Estuary due to floods in the Severn or Wye;(iv) would not seriously affect the question of sewage disposal;(d.) The results of the first stage of the investigation amply warrant His Majesty&apos;s Government in authorising the second of the proposed stages being put in hand.(e.) It should be possible to complete the second stage in about two years.19. We therefore recommend to the Committee of Civil Research : (a.) That arrangements should be made for the preparation of a complete tidal power scheme with estimates (i) of the total capital cost on the basis of the data obtained during the first stage of the enquiry, and(ii) of the total amount of electricity that might be expected to be generated.(iii) of the approximate cost of the electricity.
(b.) That Messrs. Coode, Wilson, Mitchell and vaughan-Lee should be app6inted Consulting Engineers for the purpose of carrying out this stage of the enquiry.(c) That financial provision on the following scale should be made to enable this stage to be carried out in the course of the next two years, viz.: .(i.) Fee payable to the Consulting Engi-neers (say) ...       ...............    10,000(ii.) Fees to be paid for services rendered by turbine, electrical machinery and sluice manufacturers (say)       ...     .........     3,500(iii.) Additional experiments on existing model and construction of a new large scale model of the turbine dam       .........     2,000(iv) Contingencies      ............     1,500(d.)

APPENDIX.EXPERT CO-ORDINATING SUB-COMMITTEE.Second Interim Report.I. Introductory.ON the 21st January, 1928, we submitted a First Interim Report (C.R. (S.B.) 10) in which we informed the Severn Barrage Sub-Committee of the stage which our investigations had reached. This Report included a preliminary note on the tidal model.2. We are glad to report that Professor A. H. Gibson, D.Sc, one of our members, has now completed an exhaustive series of trials and experiments on the model of the Severn Estuary, both with and without a Barrage, erected at the English Stones, in accordance with the programme of work originally laid down by the Severn Barrage Sub-Committee. Some additional experiments are being continued. A complete Report in 14 sections of the work done up to date has been prepared by Professor Gibson and is being submitted separately to the Severn Barrage Sub-Committee. In due course an appendix will &quot;be submitted giving a detailed description of the model, with drawings of the tidal mechanism.II. Construction of Model of the Severn Estuary.3. The model was originally constructed to a horizontal scale of 1 : 8,500 and a vertical scale of 1 : 100. The initial work done on the model revealed the difficulty that, while the general configuration of the banks and channels was in reasonable agreement with the recent Admiralty Survey, the heights and depths were generally less relatively in the model than in the Estuary itself, due to steeper slopes exceeding the angle of repose of the sand, namely, about 30The model was accordingly remoulded to a vertical scale of 1 : 200, on which all subsequent experiments were made.4. Investigations were also made on bed materials of varying fineness and densities, so that sand might be selected for the experiments which would most accurately reproduce the actual conditions in the Estuary. The result was that a sand having a mean diameter of 0-007 inches was used in all the tests.5. It was decided that the model should represent the Estuary from the seaward end (a line running N-S from Watchet on the Somerset Coast to Barry on the South Wales Coast), extending to Gloucester, and covering a length of the Severn River and Estuary as measured along the deep water channel of about 80 miles, the &quot; English Stones &quot; (which is the site of the proposed Barrage) being 34 miles from the sea end of the model and 46 miles from the upper or river end.6. The construction and subsequent operation of the model was undertaken in the Engineering Laboratories of the University of Manchester under the direction
sand personal supervision of Professor Gibson. It was first put into operation m March 1927, and has since been run under various conditions for a period which is equivalent to some 500 years of history in the Estuary.7. The only available Admiralty Survey was that made by Captain Beechey in 1849. It was decided to mould the model in accordance with the data available from that Survey in conjunction with the available Ordnance Surveys of the Area.III. Survey of the &quot;English Stones.&quot;8. Meanwhile, arrangements had been made with the Admiralty for a new Survey, which was carried out under the direction of the Hydrographer of the N avy, Rear-Admiral H. P. Douglas, C.B., C.M.G., by a special surveying staff of officers and men, under the command of Lieutenant-Commander D. A. Henderson, in notoriously dangerous waters and under the most difficult conditions. The Survey was begun in the summer of 1926 and completed in 1927, the new Admiralty charts being made available to our Sub-Committee in October 1928. We received communications from several of the Expert Authorities responsible for these waters expressing their admiration of the manner in which the Survey had been carried out by Commander Henderson, his officers and men, without loss of life or material loss, and in a commendably short period.9. The Survey of the dangerous &quot; English Stones,&quot; which we at first considered could only be made by aeroplane, was undertaken by the Admiralty Survey Officers with more effective practical results than could have been brought about by an aerial survey. The Survey also covered a series of important observations on tidal currents, the Severn Bore and the silt in suspension in the Estuary, all of which were of the greatest value in the conduct of the experiments on the model.10. A record of the changes in the Estuary over a period extending from 1849 to 1927 (a period of 78 years) was available from the various charts and surveys, and the experiments reproduced the tides corresponding to this period, a complete reproduction of which occupied 47 days, working through the 24 hours of each day.IV. The Working of the Model.11. Professor Gibson devised an electrically-operated displacement tank fitted with an epicyclic train of wheels, which so altered the travel of the plunger as accurately to reproduce the series of tides from springs to neaps, and neaps to springs, throughout the period covered ,by this long record, each tidal period being reproduced in the model in 73-86 seconds. The spring tidal range varies from about 36 ft. at Penarth to 40 ft. at Avonmouth and 6 ft. at Gloucester. At neaps, these figures are 18 ft. and 21 ft. at Penarth and Avonmouth respectively, but the tidal influence does not then extend beyond Framilode (14 miles below Gloucester). The spring tides at Avonmouth normally vary from 36 ft. to 46 ft., being accentuated by strong winds. In the actual experiments on the model, the tidal mechanism was set to give a 41 ft. range at Avonmouth (with an occasional variation to 46 ft.) at spring tides and 21 ft. at neaps.12. Fresh water was admitted to the model, corresponding to the discharges from the rivers Severn, Wye, Avon, Usk and Parrett, as well as from two rivulets or pills, which were considered to be of sufficient importance to affect results.13. Silt was admitted to the water from an elevated tank filled with the appropriate mixture of silt and water. This was kept in suspension by an electrically driven stirrer, and fed at the correct rate so as to represent the detritus brought down by the streams. Every care, therefore, has been taken to reproduce the natural conditions obtaining in the Estuary.14.   The objectives of this series of experiments were (i) to see if a reproduction of the tides over the period of 78 years applied to the model, moulded to the contours known to exist at the time of the Beechey Survey in 1849, would bring about an alteration of the banks and channels which would conform to the present contours shown to exist .by the Admiralty Survey of 1927:
(ii) If this first experiment were successful, thereafter to introduce a Barrage at the &quot;English Stones,&quot; and observe the effect of the application of the same series of tides upon the Estuary formation as it exists to-day, that is to say, the effect of the Barrage (a) on the movement of the sand banks and on general siltation, both above and below the Barrage, and the effect on the navigable channels;(b) the magnitude of the tidal range and the effect of the Barrage on the times of high and low water at points below the Barrage and in the Tidal Basin above it;(c) the tidal currents above and below the barrage; and(d) the available head on the turbines at each instant over a complete lunar cycle.15. The result of the first series of experiments (i.e., those without the Barrage) is that all the phenomena connected with the movement of water in the Estuary are reproduced in the model with a remarkable degree of accuracy.16. The behaviour of the tides at all points of the Estuary, whether it be their height, range, or rate of rise and fall; the phenomenon of the bore both as to its height and speed and the point of commencement and point of dying out of the bore; the drift of floats and the current velocities at various points above and below the &quot;English Stones,&quot; are all faithfulby reproduced and can be demonstrated on the model at any time.17. With regard to the formation of the sandbanks, silt deposits and main channels, a comparison of the charts and cross-sections prepared from Surveys of the model at times corresponding to 1886, 1901 and 1924 with corresponding charts and cross-sections of the actual Estuary reveals a high degree of general agreement.18. It may, therefore, be said generally that the agreement between the formation in the model and that in the Estuary itself is such as to justify the assump-tion that the changes which are produced in the model after the introduction of the Barrage at the &quot; English Stones &quot; would correspond with the changes which would be brought about in the actual Estuary both below and above the Barrage.19. After operating the model as described above without a Barrage for the period 1849 to 1927, a Barrage was added to the model at the &quot; English Stones &quot; con-forming to the design suggested by the Ministry of Transport immediately following the publication of the Water Power Resources Committee&apos;s Preliminary Report on the Severn. The model was then operated over a long series of years under conditions representing (a) very accurately those conditions affecting the formation of the silt banksin the actual Estuary below the &quot;English Stones&quot;; and(b) those conditions which would hold in the Estuary above the &quot; EnglishStones &quot; after the introduction of the Barrage.20. In each case Surveys of the model were made at frequent intervals and measurements observed of the current velocities, tidal levels and ranges at various points in the Estuary. It was found that below the Barrage the effect on the levels of high and low water is small, e.g., at Avonmouth at high water springs the level is lowered about 6 inches and at low water only some 2^ inches, while at neaps the effect is negligible. Above the Barrage the high water level is, of course, reduced. At springs the maximum reduction of level is slightly less than 4 feet at high water (at Sharpness and Framilode). The level of low water is increased at all points up to Framilode and is practically unaffected higher up the Severn. At neaps, the level is reduced by only some 2 feet as a maximum at high water. The effect of floods was also investigated, and, as would be expected, the levels both at high water and low water are appreciably lower with the Barrage than without it.21. Except in the region between the Barrage and the Beachley Peninsula, the maximum velocity both of flood and ebb currents was reduced as the result of the addition of the Barrage. Below the Barrage the maximum flood velocity off Avonmouth was similarly reduced from. 5 knots to 2-5 knots, the ebb velocity being reduced from 4-5 to 4 knots.   In the Tidal Basin between Beachley and Sharpness[194.04] c
the maximum flood velocity was reduced on the average by about 2 knots, while the maximum ebb velocity was reduced by 2-8 knots. The current velocity immediately above the sluice gates during the filling of the Basin is necessarily high, attaining a maximum value of about 12-5 knots.22. The effect of the Barrage on the configuration of the Estuary is to produce a general flattening of the banks above the Barrage with a reduction in the longitudinal gradients. Above Framilode the bed is lowered slightly, and below Eramilode there is a tendency for the sandbanks to be lowered and for silt and sand to be deposited in the deep water channel; thence to be carried down stream, where much of it ultimately accumulates in the Shoots. Immediately below the Barrage there is a general lowering of the level of the bed, the eroded material being carried seaward and deposited mainly on the Welsh Hook, and in the channel from 2 to 9 miles below Portishead.23. The average depth in the channel between the Barrage and Portishead is slightly increased. Further down stream the depth is alternatively increased and diminished by some 4 ft. over a distance of about 2 miles below Portishead. Over the next 7 miles there is a general reduction of depth which averages 7 ft. after a period of seventy-five years. The maximum reduction in depth (13 ft.) occurs 2^ miles below Portishead, and 8 miles below Portishead the reduction is 11 ft. Notwithstanding this reduction the minimum depth at low water at any point below Portishead is still 6 - 2 fathoms, and is, in fact, deeper than some parts of the present channel below Avonmouth. The navigation of Avonmouth should therefore not be injuriously affected.24. The depths in the King&apos;s Road Anchorage and the width of the channel are not sensibly altered by the Barrage, while the effect on the Newport Deeps Channel is also very small.25. The experiments on the model after the introduction of the Barrage indicate that during the first twenty years the total siltation in the Tidal Basin per annum is 580,000 cubic yards, of which 380,000 cubic yards are deposited in the channel below low water mark and 200,000 cubic yards on the banks.During the second twenty years the annual siltation is 280,000 cubic yards, of which 170,000 cubic yards are deposited in the channel, and the remainder, 110,000 cubic yards, on the banks. Much of the deposition in the channel is, however, in places where it is so deep that navigation is not affected.In order to maintain at all points of the channel between Sharpness and Beachley the same, depths of ivater at high ivater as before the introduction of the Barrage, it is considered it would be necessary to arrange for the removal of some 500,000 cubic yards of material from the basin during the first year of operation, and after this the amount of dredging may possibly be reduced gradually until, at the end of forty years, it may only be necessary to remove about 150,000 cubic yards per annum to enable the bed of the channel to be maintained.26. The two points at which the deposit is most marked are the Shoots and the navigable channel running alongside the Narlwood Rocks. Owing, however, to the great depth of the Shoots the experiments show that it would take about 100 years for the depth to be so reduced as to affect navigation at this point, while a suitably placed training wall or revetment would appreciably reduce the deposition in the Narlwood Channel.27. Some dredging of material from the Basin would, however, be necessary if it were considered essential to maintain at all points between Sharpness and the Barrage the same depth at high water as now obtains.V. Conclusions.28. The work done on the model with a Barrage erected at the &quot;English Stones &quot; shows that a Barrage (a) would not injuriously affect navigation below the Barrage; (&amp;) would not seriously affect navigation above the Barrage at any time, and would improve it at times of low water:(c) would reduce the effect of inundations in the Upper Estuary due to floodsin the Severn or Wye;(d) would not injuriously affect the question of sewage disposal.
29. The results of the work already done on the model have indicated that a modification of the Barrage will lead to an appreciable increase of about 2 ft. in the high water level in the Tidal Basin, and in the power which may be developed. The investigation of this new barrage is now in progress, and its results, along with those of a parallel investigation of the power output of both Barrages will be submitted as an extension of the Report in due course.(Signed)JOHN SNELL.
