[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed&apos; for the Cabinet.   July 1929.SECRET. Gopy No.      39CP. 215 (29).CABINET.THE BAGHDAD-HAIFA RAILWAY AND TRANS-DESERT PIPE-LINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the accompanying memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office on the subject of a proposal which has been long under considera-tion to construct a railway and oil pipe-line from Baghdad to Haifa.The memorandum tells the past history of this proposal, and the question arises, whether, on general grounds, and from the point of view of assisting to solve the unemployment problem, it is desirable that the railway should be at once put in hand, and it seems that this will not happen without Government aid. As the memorandum explains, a total sum of  1\ millions would probably require to be found during the first five years after the inception of the scheme, but orders for about  3 millions upon railway material may be expected, and could be assured for this country during the five years in question if the Government assisted in the manner suggested. I need not, I think, elaborate the advantages derivable from such a railway and pipe-line, viewed either as a measure of peaceful development or as a strategic asset in time of war.I have circulated a separate Cabinet Paper (CP. 214 (29) ) on the wider question of our position in Iraq, since it may be said that we ought first to consider that question and not to decide upon the matter of the railway and pipe-line until our future relationship with Iraq is settled. But I would point out that the railway and pipe-line will be required in any case, and the question of unemployment is so pressing that I feel that I should be wrong in holding back the accompanying memorandum pending the settlement of the wider question. A matter involving possible orders, in one of our most depressed industries, to the extent of  3,000,000 is of such importance that I hope that it may be found possible to reach a decision upon it, even if it is found necessary to defer a final decision upon the wider question of our future position in Iraq.P.Colonial Office, Downing Street, July 18, 1929.[19593]B
THE BAGHDAD-HAIFA RAILWAY AND TRANS-DESERT PIPE-LINE.ON the 30th April, 1929, Mr. Amery circulated to the late Cabinet a memorandum in which he strongly recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accord such measure of financial assistance as would ensure the construction of a railway between Baghdad and Haifa, and that this financial assistance should take the form of a contribution towards interest on capital, preferably to be found from the proposed Colonial Development Fund. Mr. Amery&apos;s recommendation was based on the conclusion that, unless such assistance were given, this railway would not be built, and that, if it were not built, it would be impossible to ensure that the pipe-lines connecting the Iraq and Persian oil-fields with the Mediterranean had their outlet at Haifa and not at a Syrian port.2. The history of this highly complicated question and of the various negotia-tions which have taken place between the Iraq Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company (now the &quot;Iraq Petroleum Company&quot;), and between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government has been set out within as short a compass as possible in an Historical Note prepared under the instructions of the late Secretary of State and circulated by him to the Cabinet on the 16th March, 1929. Since that Memorandum was prepared, however, certain further developments have taken place and a brief Note is attached, bringing the history of the question up to date.   Copies of the earlier Historical Note can be supplied if required.3. The late Government decided to postpone a decision upon the points raised in Mr. Amery&apos;s Memorandum of the 30th April until after the General Election. Since that decision was taken, the French Government, in replying to a Note from the British Charge d&apos;Affaires at Paris, have made a statement which tends to confirm the information received from other sources that it is their intention to promote the construction of a railway connecting up the port of Tripoli with Deir-ez-Zor on the Iraq frontier. If this plan materialises, the risk of the Iraq Petroleum Company adopting a route through Syria for their pipe-line and selecting-Tripoli as its western terminal will be greatly increased. The danger of the French Government being first in the field in this matter of Trans-Desert Railway construction therefore seems to be one which cannot be lightly disregarded and for that reason the question of principle raised in Mr. Amery&apos;s Memorandum of the 30th April, viz., whether or not His Majesty&apos;s Government should participate in promoting the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa, appears to call for an early decision.4. The strategical or defence arguments in favour of the course advocated by Mr. Amery are obvious. The Chiefs of Staff who had the question under consideration some twelve months ago, summarised the strategic considerations in favour of the Haifa-Baghdad pipe-line and railway in the following terms : &quot;The proposed scheme for a pipe-line and railway from Baghdad to Haifa is of the greatest strategical importance in connection with the supply of oil-fuel to the Navy at Home, in the Mediterranean and on the route to the Far East, and, in addition, should greatly strengthen the whole of our defensive organisation in the Near East by facilitating the transport of men and munitions to Iraq for the defence of our interests in those regions.&quot;The Special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which was set up by the late Government to examine this question, added the following observations : &apos;&apos; (a) Britain would be far less dependent upon the import of oil from countries outside British influence, an advantage both in Peace and War.(b) Britain would obtain the virtual control over the output of what may well prove to be one of the richest oil-fields in the world.&quot;[19593] b 2
The Oil Board, a standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, in a report submitted in April last, referred to the question in the following-terms :.- &quot; The Oil Board advise that (1) If the terminal of the Baghdad pipeline is at Haifa, then * * * * * *(h) An additional source of oil supply under British control would become available for the Empire, and would be of immense importance in time of war in the event of either (i) the United States of America being unfriendly, or (ii) the maximum output from the South Persian Fields being unobtainable for any reason.(c) Should the demand for Anglo-Persian Oil west of Suez justify the construction of a pipe-line from the Southern Persian Fields to the Baghdad-Haifa route, a saving of a 6,400 miles&apos; journey by sea and the Suez Canal charges ( 900,000 in 1927) would be effected. In these circum-stances it would not be necessary for Tankers fuelling the Fleet from Great Britain, in the event of a war in the Far East, to carry oil from Abadan homewards, as they could ship oil at Haifa. The result would be an important saving of tanker tonnage, as the time saved in deviation to Haifa instead of Abadan would be 16 days.   Further, whatever the theatre of- war, Anglo-Persian oil would be readily available, as it could be diverted east or west as required.(2) If the terminal is at a Syrian Port, then (d) The British Empire could not rely on the receipt of oil from this source.(e) On account of the San Remo Oil Agreement, by which the French Government can claim the purchase of 25 per cent, of the oil shipped by the Anglo-Persian Company through a Syrian Port, it would be less likely that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would develop a Mediterranean outlet for their oil, and the full advantages (b) and (c) above would not be obtained.(/) The danger of an export tax being placed on the oil by the Syrian Government would exist.(g) The protection of a pipe-line vital to the Empire would be in the hands of a Foreign Power.(3) In view of the above considerations, it will be of first importance to the Empire in a maritime war that the oil pipe-line from Iraq should have a terminal at Haifa.&quot;5. To these arguments it might be replied that the influence and wealth of this country should be directed towards Peace and not towards War; that Peace is probable and War unlikely; and that our resources should not be dissipated upon preparations for a remote contingency at a time when the need for expenditure upon peaceful development has never been greater. This is true enough. But even so, there are contingencies that cannot be ignored. War might be forced upon this -country either as a. result of our obligations under the League Covenant or for some other unavoidable reason. A measure of insurance against such an eventuality seems not only permissible, but prudent. Moreover, the insurance advocated in the present case is not of a character which might in itself serve to provoke hostilities. It is true that it is of the nature of a preparation for war; but it is in no way public or provocative, and is thus free from the objections attaching to the customary measures of preparation, such as the piling up of armaments or the competitive building of navies.6. The advantages of British control over the output of the Iraq and Persian fields are far from negligible, even under Peace conditions. It is perhaps almost equally important in time of peace that the oil from the Iraq and Persian fields should have its outlet at a British rather than a Syrian port. Whatever may be the future development of the use of powdered coal, it seems clear that our Mercantile Marine will be increasingly dependent on oil in the immediate future, and that the control of fuelling stations will be of great importance to our trade. The Mediterranean terminal of the pipe-lines from Iraq and Persia is likely to become the principal, if not the only, oil fuelling port for British shipping in the waters near home, and it is important that it should be under British rather than French
control. Past experience goes to show that, if the port were situated in Syria,, the French might use their position to discriminate unfairly between their own and foreign shipping in the matter of dues and port facilities generally. Concealed -concessions in favour of French ships or vexatious imposts and restrictions upon foreign ships might definitely weight the scales against the latter. There are a number of devices by which discrimination of this character could in practice be exercised without actually infringing international commitments.7. The advantages flowing from the construction of a Baghdad-Haifa railway would not be confined to our Navy and Mercantile Marine. The result of the adoption of this project would be the placing of important orders in the heavy industries in this country. Brigadier-General Sir II. O. Mance, who investigated the question on the spot on behalf of the prospective eoncessionnaires, has estimated that, on the assumption that steel sleepers are used, the construction of the railway would lead to the expenditure of more than  3,000,000 upon railway material, &amp;c, in Europe or America. If His Majesty&apos;s Government were to assist in financing this project, they would be in a position to insure that the orders for this material were placed in this country. Sir H. O. M.&quot;ance anticipates that, although a complete . and detailed survey of the route would occupy one year, six months after the opening of the survey, it would be possible to place substantial orders for rails and bridging material, and that orders for the remainder of the material could be placed immediately upon the completion of the survey. The construction of this railway would, therefore, constitute an important contribution to the relief of unemployment in this country.8. There is another aspect of this proposal which has hitherto not been mentioned. The construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa would contribute very largely to the material prosperity of Palestine and Iraq. Iraq is potentially an important agricultural country. Its resources remain undeveloped, primarily -owing to the lack of capital, but partly also owing to the absence of means of rapid communication with European markets. The prosperity of a country is very largely the measure of its efficient communications, and once the products of Iraq can &apos;be transported to Europe cheaply and quickly, ,capital for their development will be forthcoming. The acceptance of the Mandate, it is submitted, places this country under a certain obligation to assist in the development of Iraq. We have chosen, from motives not wholly unselfish, to establish in Iraq a quasi-independent Government, and the special status which this confers upon Iraq, is frequently cited as an argument against assisting the Iraq Government to raise money for the development of the country&apos;s natural resources. Had we chosen to establish the normal mandatory system, i.e.. to administer the country more or less as a Colony, this objection, could not have been raised, and there would not have been the same difficulty in obtaining from the British Treasury the credit facilities which have been &apos;extended to colonies and other mandated territories and of which Iraq is at present so greatly in need. The finances of the present Administration in Iraq are really sound; yet, in view of the indeterminate status of the country, it is impossible for the Iraq Government to borrow except at an exorbitant rate of interest. Colonies are already, and other Mandated Territories shortly will be, able to borrow cheaply under the Colonial Stocks Acts. Iraq, although in a sounder position financially than many Colonies and Mandated Territories, is unable to do so. Consequently, in this respect, the system of government which we have chosen to set up in Iraq has had the effect of indirectly militating against that development of the country&apos;s resources which it is our responsibility to promote. In fostering the political development of Iraq, we have retarded economic development. The present proposal that His Majesty&apos;s Government should assist in the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa would do much to remedy the present position.9.   To sum up, the construction of the Baghdad-Haifa railway would serve the following ends : (1.) It would do much to ensure- an adequate supply.of Oil to our Fleet and mercantile Marine in the event of War, and thus reduce our presentdependence upon foreign sources of supply. (2) It would safeguard British shipping against the unfair discriminationthat might be applied if a Syrian port were chosen as a Mediterraneanterminal of the pipe-line
Historical ]\ote.Some eighteen months ago the Iraq Petroleum Company, then called the &quot; Turkish Petroleum Company,&quot; applied to the Iraq Government for an extension of the period within which, in accordance with the terms of their Concession, they were required to select plots for development before throwing the rest of the field open for outside competition. Prolonged negotiations followed, in the course of which the British Oil Development Company (a rival Group desirous of obtaining Oil Con-cessions in Iraq for themselves, and thus opposed to the grant of any extension to the Iraq Petroleum Company) played an important part. The final outcome was that the Iraq Government declared themselves ready to grant the Iraq Petroleum Company an extension of two years, provided that within that period the Company carried out a detailed survey of the route for a railway and pipe-line from Baghdad to Haifa and submitted a complete project for the construction of a railway on that route. The Iraq Government were also ready to agree that if, at the expiry of that period, the Company were prepared to construct without cost to the Government a railway from Baghdad to Haifa, they should be granted a further extension of three years.2. For reasons other than those influencing His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Iraq Government were eager to see a railway built to Haifa and that route adopted for the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;s pipe-line, and, in suggesting the conditions mentioned above, they were acting spontaneously and not under pressure from His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Iraq Petroleum Company ultimately accepted these conditions, which were then embodied in a draft Agreement and a draft comple-mentary letter. The local representative of the Company informed the Iraq Government that he was authorised to sign both the Agreement and the letter. At this stage, however, the Iraq Government resigned on the question of the revision of the Military and Financial Agreements with this country, and, although prevailed upon to remain in office pending the appointment of a new Ministry, declined to deal with other than purely routine business or to enter into any new commitments. The negotiations with the Iraq Petroleum Company were thus brought to a standstill.3. The French Government then intervened. They represented that His Majesty&apos;s Government had put pressure upon the Iraq Government to induce them to insist upon the adoption of the Haifa route as a condition of granting the extension applied for by the Iraq Petroleum Company, and they demanded that this pressure should be withdrawn and the Iraq Government and the Company left free to settle the question of the extension in accordance with strictly economic considerations. This view the French Government pressed in several Notes and interviews at the Foreign Office. The French Governments demarches were considered by the late Cabinet, and, in response to their request, Mr. Amery circulated to the Cabinet on the 16th March, 1929, a Historical Note summarising the correspondence and negotiations which had led up to the present situation and demonstrating that the action of the Iraq Government was spontaneous and not the result of pressure on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Eventually the French Government were informed, in a Note addressed to the Quai d&apos;Orsay on the 29th April, that (1.) His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook to put no pressure on the Iraq Government either to maintain or withdraw the condition to which the French Government had taken exception. (2.) His Majesty&apos;s Government did not conceal their desire for the adoption of Haifa as the terminus of the pipe-line and railway, and they reserved their full right to promote it by such means as complete or partial construction, a guarantee of interest or a subsidy, or by similar methods-(3.) It would contribute to the relief of unemployment in the heavy industries in this country.(4.) It would promote the economic development of Iraq and Palestine, thus assisting us in the discharge of our mandatory obligations.10. To secure these objects it is estimated that His Majesty&apos;s Government would need to make a contribution towards interest on capital amounting to some  300,000 annually for the first five years from the inception of the enterprise.Middle East Department,Colonial Office. July 12, 1929.
Both the Iraq Government and the British Chairman of the Iraq Petroleum Company were informed of the undertaking given to the French Government.4. At the end of April Mr. Amery, apprehending that the Iraq Government might not stick to their guns in the matter of the Haifa route and satisfied that the only sure way of leading the Iraq Petroleum Company to adopt that route for their pipe-line was to ensure the prior construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa, circulated a memorandum to the late Cabinet, strongly recommending that His Majesty&apos;s Government should promote the construction of the Haifa-Baghdad Railway by contributing towards the cost of that project. The matter was considered by the late Cabinet, but it was decided to postpone a decision until after the General Election.Since then, the French Government have replied to the British Note of the 29th April. In their reply they state, inter alia, that the French Government for their part wish to see a railway constructed through Syrian territory with Tripoli as its terminus and with a pipe-line also debouching at that port. They therefore reserve to themselves the right to promote the construction of such a railway by all appropriate means.5. In the meantime a new Ministry has been formed in Iraq and has recently had under consideration the question of the extension of time applied for by the Iraq Petroleum Company. The High Commissioner has been instructed not to intervene with advice but to leave the Iraq Ministry to decide the question for themselves. From information which has been received it would appear that the new Ministry, unlike their predecessors, are prepared to abandon the condition in regard to the adoption of the Haifa route, and are attempting to obtain from the Company a loan on specially favourable terms in return for granting the extension applied for. The doubt felt by Mr. Amery whether the Iraq Government could be relied upon to maintain their insistence upon the adoption of the Haifa route has therefore proved to be justified.Middle-East Detriment,Colonial Office, Jidy 12, 1929.
