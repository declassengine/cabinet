(THIS DOCUIffil-Fr IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MA.JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). SECRET. copy No. ^CP. 221 (29)CABINETm Land DrainagetMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Royal Commission on Land Drainage reported in November 1927, and the late Government announced in their Election Manifesto that If returned to power they proposed to introduce legislation based on the Commission&apos;s report.The Commission take a gloomy view of the present position as regards land drainage and of the steady deterioration of agricultural land.     They stress the chaotic character of the present law on the subject, the limitation of powers possessed by existing authorities, the large number of such authorities and the lack of any co-ordination among them.     If the present state of affairs is allowed to continue, they consider that further deterioration of large areas of agricultural land must follow.The principal recommendations of the Commission are that:-(i) The whole of a river basin should be brought within the control of a new Catchment Area Authority composed mainly of representatives of the County and County Borough Councils and should be rated for drainage purposes, with a lower rate for the uplands than the lowlands,(ii) The Catchment Area Authority should be directly responsible for the main channels of the river, but Internal Drainage Boards should be reorganised and brought under the control of the Catchment Area Authority,Where necessary new internal authorities would be set up.
(111)    ,       Catchment Area Authorities should precept on County Councils for funds, which would be raised as part of the general county rate and the rates of the Internal Boards should be collected by the local rating authorities, instoad of by the Drainage Authorities direct. (Iv) All drainage rates should be levied on annual value, and not acreage as is common at present, (v) The general land drainage law should be revised and consolidated. During the past year preliminary surveys for the purpose of defining the chief catchment areas have been proceeding and sufficient progress has been made to enable the drafting of a Bill to begin.     Owing, however, to the complete derating of agricultural land under the Local Government Act, 1929, if the rating recommendations of the Royal Commission were strictly followed, agricultural land, which mainly benefits from drainage, would be exempt from drainage rates and.factories would only pay on a 25$ basis.     There are various alternatives for overcoming the difficulty, and I suggest that representatives of the Treasury, the Ministry of Health and of my Department should be asked to consider these and agree upon the most satisfactory solution.It will no doubt be necessary, as the Commission themselves suggest, for the Government to make grants from the Exchequer towards the cost of some of the larger works carried out by the Catchment Area Authorities, but the extent of such State assistance is difficult to forecast until the rating provisions have been settled, and in any case some years must elapse bebre the need for State grants on any considerable scale can arise.     If, however,  certain comprehensive schemes for overhauling the drainage of the River Thames and other large rivers should mature, it is
possible that considerable stuns spread over several years might be required.   The principle of State grants for drainage has been accepted and in operation since 1921.I regard the matter of the utmost importance, both on agricultural and political grounds.    Drainage offers the chief agricultural contribution towards the relief of unemployment; and the water-logged condition of much of the land, is a serious handicap to efficient production. The Royal Commission state, and I have every reason to accept their advice, that drastic revision of the law must precede further drainage development, and I therefore ask my colleagues to authorise the immediate preparation of a Bill following generally the recommendations of the Commission^ but subject to revision of the rating proposals as indicated above. The Bill will necessarily take a considerable time to draft in view of its far-reaching effect and the very complicated and abscure nature of the existing law.    It will, of course, be submitted, when ready, to the consideration of the Home Affairs Committee in the usual way, and the Cabinet will thus have a further opportunity of deciding the exact place it should take in the Government&apos;s legislative programme, but I,hope it may be possible to introduce such a measure early in the coming year.N.B.- Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 20th July, 1929.
