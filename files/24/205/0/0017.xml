Memorandum by the Prime lllnisteroTo the Cabinet.We must at our next meeting make some provisional arrangements regarding tho Autumn Session, which,  I think, we ought to announce as beginning on the 29th October. This date would make it pretty certain that I was back from America.     We could provisionally decide to adjourn on the 19th or 20th December.     This would give us seven weekso     Assuming that the Select Committee gives Private Members part of their time in. the Autumn, only about eighteen days would be available for Government legislation, but I think that would be quite sufficient.I have been, in communication with the Departments asking them to produce as quickly as possible the Bills mentioned in the Klng,!s Speech for which they are responsible.     Some of these ought to be introduced before we rise next week so as to be ready for the earliest days in the resumed Session.      There are one or two minor Bills which can stop a gap, but we want some major ones;    and early in tho -aitumn Session we must take the Widows&apos; Pensions Bill, a Slum Clearance Bill, a Bill amending Unemployment Insurance, the WashingtonE 0 RET. P.217(29).
Hours Convention. Bill, and a factories Bill.     The Solicitor General has already given oral notice of a Bill amending the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act; and we shall have to face and finally decide our policy upon coal before the I-fcmse meetsoThis is a tremendously heavy programme..      I think we should get the Washington Hours Convent ion as quickly as possible sent&apos;to Committee upstairs, and a Bill Including Slum Clearance.      On the back of these should come an Unemployment Insurance Bill and the Factories Bill.     A Widows&apos;  Pensions Bill would have to be kept on the Floor of the House but should be produced early. I understand that the Lord Privy Seal will require some more legislation.I should be glad if the Cabinet would consider this memorandum and be ready to make proposals at the next meetingofintId, )   J.Roll,10, Downing St., S0W01,. 18th July,  1989o
