[This Document is-the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1929.SECRET.Copy No.36CP. 239 (29).CABINET.POLICY IN IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE for the information of the Cabinet an important despatch (Appendix 1) from the High Commissioner for Iraq and a memorandum thereon which has been prepared in the Colonial Office. These documents discuss both the broad principles which should govern our future relations with Iraq, and also the question of immediate action to be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in order to create a favourable atmosphere at Baghdad. I am in general agreement with the recommendations made in the departmental memorandum. Since the latter was written, however, I have received a disquieting telegram from Sir Gilbert Clayton on the general situation in Iraq. I append a copy of this telegram and of subsequent telegrams which I have exchanged with him (Appendix 3). As will be seen the situation anticipated in paragraph 3 of the Colonial Office memorandum has in fact arisen. Ah Iraqi Ministry has resigned and no alternative-Ministry is prepared to take its place in the absence of a clear statement of policy by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In practice, this means in the absence of further concessions to Iraqi national sentiment. There is, I think, no immediate cause for serious anxiety in Iraq, but it is apparent from Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s telegram that the situation is deteriorating and any prolonged interruption of constitutional government in Iraq at the present moment, having regard to the situation in Palestine, might well lead to disastrous results. The unfortunate events in Palestine have at present had no serious repercussions in Iraq, but Sir Gilbert Clayton reports that the country at large has been profoundly stirred. While, therefore, no spread of the disorders in Palestine need be anticipated in Iraq at the moment, Moslem sentiment in that country has undoubtedly been aroused and any serious political disaffection just now might supply the spark which would set the whole country ablaze. It should not be overlooked that the reinforcement of our present scanty garrison in Iraq would be no easy matter. Several weeks would necessarily elapse before troops could be brought in any numbers from India. It is, therefore, of the first importance that there should be no avoidable delay in taking such action as may be practicable to strengthen the High Commissioner^ hand and to ease the political situation generally. As will be seen, Sir Gilbert Clayton asks for authority to give the Iraq Government an unqualified undertaking to support Iraq&apos;s admission to the League. The arguments for and against this course, as they present themselves to the Colonial Office, are set out in paragraphs 5 to 7 in the departmental memorandum. Even without the information now supplied by Sir Gilbert Clayton the arguments in favour of the course suggested would seem conclusive; in the light of that information those arguments gain additional importance and urgency.Sir Gilbert Clayton, however, now asks that the date for the admission of Iraq to the League should be advanced by nine months, viz., from June 1932 to September 1931. I am not at present prepared to support this proposal. As was explained in the memorandum, which I circulated to the Cabinet on the 18th July (CP. 214 (29)), the time available to us in which to make the necessary arrangements before Iraq can enter the League is already all too short. There are a number of difficult and complicated questions outstanding between this country and- Iraq which require settlement. Much preliminary work will have to be done both at Geneva and else-where if Iraq&apos;s candidature is to be successful. I am satisfied that any advancement of the date for Iraq&apos;s admission and any substantial shortening of the intervening[19856]b
period would not only create unnecessary embarrassment for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, but would result in disappointment for Iraq. Moreover, 1932 has the merit that it is the next date upon which, under the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1926, the question of Iraq&apos;s admission automatically comes up for consideration. Furthermore, the -League Council are aware from the published Treaty of 1927 that His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate the entry of Iraq into the League in 1932. It would be difficult to make out any case for the advancement of that date, which was not based upon grounds of mere political expediency.The situation in Iraq is, however, critical. The need for action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to relieve the present tension is urgent, and I strongly recommend that immediate authority be given to Sir Gilbert Clayton to inform the Iraq Government, without qualification or proviso, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to support Iraq&apos;s candidature for admission to the League in 1932. I trust that the Cabinet will also &quot;adopt, in principle, the other recommendations made in the Colonial Office memorandum in order that no time may be lost in putting in train the negotiations for a lasting settlement with the Iraq Government.P.Colonial Office, September 3, 1929.MEMORANDUM.Future Policy in Iraq.AFTER a close study of the situation in Iraq during the six months which have elapsed since he took up his appointment, Sir G. Clayton has now submitted his recommendations in regard to the future policy to be followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Iraq. His proposals (Appendix I) are based upon the assumption that there will be no change in the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to support the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations in 1932, provided that no serious or unforeseen check in the progress of the country takes place in the mean-time. In a memorandum (CP. 214 (29)) recently circulated to the Cabinet, the Secretary of State for the Colonies recommended that this policy should remain unchanged, and the following remarks are based upon the assumption that this recommendation will be adopted.2.   Sir G. Clayton&apos;s proposals fall naturally into two classes : (a.) Steps to be taken now in order to foster a spirit of mutual confidence and goodwill, and thus pave the way for a settlement in 1932; and(&amp;.) The general principles which should govern the relations of this country with Iraq, after that country has become a member of the League of Nations.Before considering the actual steps recommended by Sir G. Clayton, it would be well to examine the reasons which call for immediate action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. It may be asked why is any action necessary now if Iraq will in any case enter the League in three years&apos; time, and why not carry on until then on the basis of the existing treaties and agreements. The explanation is very largely to be found in the internal political situation of Iraq. When Sir G. Clayton wrote his despatch, he contemplated that the Cabinet of Taufiq Beg Suwaidi (admittedly a stop-gap Cabinet, without a policy and with no clear mandate from the country) would shortly fall, and that Abdul Muhsin Beg, who resigned last January in connection with the abortive negotiations for the revision of the Military and Financial Agreements of 1924, would be called upon to form a Ministry. That expectation has since been fulfilled. Sir G. Clayton anticipated that Abdul Muhsin would be unwilling to resume office, or, in any case, would be unable to retain office for any length of time, unless he could show some definite improvement in Iraq&apos;s relations with this country and Iraq one step nearer to her goal of complete independence.   But, it may be argued, what have His Majesty&apos;s Government to do
with party politics in Iraq? Is it their business to facilitate the advent to office of any particular party leader? In principle this question admits of only one answer, but, in practice, the interests of this country are to some extent linked up with the political fortunes of Abdul Muhsin. He is&quot; by far the most solid figure in the shifting scene of Iraq politics. He is markedly pro-British in sentiment. His prestige throughout the country is unequalled, and in the present Iraqi Parliament he controls a commanding majority. Consequently, not only would he be a reasonable negotiator, but, once a settlement had been reached, his influence should be sufficient to ensure its acceptance, both by Parliament and the country at large.It is not, however, merely a question of Abdul Muhsin&apos;s personality. He represents moderate opinion in Iraq as opposed to the extreme nationalism of his political opponents. If he is not prepared to accept office unless further political concessions are forthcoming from His Majesty&apos;s Government, it can safely be assumed that any other prospective Ministry would demand even greater concessions as the price of accepting office.4. The question &quot;why should Ave not rest content with existing agreements until 1932 \&apos;&apos; admits of a simple answer. The most important of the Agreements subsidiary to the Iraq Treaty of 1922, namely, the Military Agreement, expired some twelve months ago and has not been reneAved. In consequence, there is at present no formal Treaty sanction for the presence of British Forces in Iraq or for the legal privileges and immunities Avhich they enjoy. At any moment the Iraq Government could in theory challenge the position of the British garrison and demand the a withdrawal of their privileges. It is of the utmost importance that the Iraq Government should be induced to extend the period of this Agreement until 1932, or until such time as a revised Agreement has been concluded. This the Iraq Government have consistently declined to do, except in return for some definite quid pro quo.The case for some immediate concession by His Majesty&apos;s GoArernment is therefore a strong one.5. Of the three concessions or &quot;gestures&quot; suggested by Sir G. Clayton, by far the most important, and the one most likely to carry weight with the Iraq GoA&apos;erament, is the proposal to give-an unqualified undertaking to support Iraq&apos;s candidature for admission to the League in 1932. The Iraq Government have been formally assured that His Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to the undertaking given in Article 8 of the unratified Treaty of 1927; this Avas in the folloAving terms :--&apos;&apos; Provided the present progress of Iraq is maintained and all goes Avell in the interval, His Britannic Majesty will support the candidature of Iraq for admission to the League of Nations in 1932.&quot;The Iraq Government have always disliked the proviso which qualifies this Article. They fear that it might be used by His Majesty&apos;s Government as a loophole of escape, and&quot; that, if for any reason the admission of Iraq to the League in 1932 Avere inconvenient, His Majesty&apos;s Government might take advantage of the proviso to decline to support her candidature. They do rather less than justice to. His Majesty&apos;s Government, but the suspicion does exist, and no alternative formula of qualifica-tion, such as that suggested to the Iraq Government last spring (and quoted in paragraph 13 of Sir G. Clayton&apos;s despatch), has served to dispel it.6. Sir G. Clayton takes the vieAV that it must be obvious to all that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not in practice recommend Iraq&apos;s admission to the League in 1932 if some really serious check in the progress of the country were to occur in the meantime, and that, as this is so apparent, there is no need to state it expressly m the form of a proviso. Apart from widespread internal disorders or a serious interruption of constitutional government, it is certainly difficult to imagine any deA^development in Iraq Avhich could justly be regarded as covered by the Avording of the present proviso, and thus as justifying His Majesty&apos;s Government in declining to fulfil their undertaking Avhen the time came. A mere refusal by the Iraq Govern-ment to accept some condition which we might seek to impose in order to safeguard Imperial interests, such, for example, as the retention of a British Air Force in Iraq, or the employment of a specified number of British officials, could not, it is submitted, legitimately be described as an interruption in Iraq&apos;s progress. In the event of such a refusal, His Majesty&apos;s Government could not therefore make use of the proviso to threaten Iraq with declining to support her admission to the League. Apart from&apos; moral considerations, such a manoeuvre Avould lay His Majesty&apos;s [19Q56] B&apos;2
Government open to the charge of sharp practice. Our action could not escape publicity, and the knowledge that we were attempting to use our Mandatory position to further purely British interests would excite most unfavourable criticism both at Geneva and elsewhere. In short, the proviso is of no practical use to us in obtaining the satisfaction of Imperial needs. For this we must rely, not upon intimidation, but upon identity of interests.7. It remains to be considered whether exception would be taken at Geneva to a bare statement that it was our intention to support Iraq&apos;s candidature in 1932. It is for the Foreign Office to advise on this aspect of the question. It is outside the proper sphere of the Colonial Office. Nevertheless, it is submitted that if such a statement were to give rise to criticism in League circles, this could be met by the rejoinder that the League Council could rely upon His Majesty&apos;s Government not to recommend the admission of Iraq to the League unless they were fully satisfied that Iraq was in every way fit for admission, and that, if the assurance of His Majesty&apos;s Government was not considered sufficient, it was always open to the Council to satisfy themselves upon this point by independent investigation.The effect in Iraq of such an unqualified undertaking would be excellent. It, would effectively dispel the suspicion, now current in Iraqi political circles, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no real intention of establishing Iraq in full independence in 1932. It would dispose once and for all of the canard, reproduced almost daily in the vernacular press, that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to &quot; colonise &quot; Iraq. It would create a favourable atmosphere for the negotiation of a comprehensive settlement.The objections hitherto raised, in so far as they were not prompted by considerations of Gladstonian caution, appear to have been inspired by a possibly excessive regard for the susceptibilities of the League. In comparison with the important advantages anticipated from the proposal, the objections would seem relatively unimpressive. It is strongly recommended that Sir G. Clayton&apos;s proposal should be adopted.8.   The other two &quot; gestures &quot; recommended by Sir G. Clayton are : (a.) That the control of Iraq affairs should be transferred from the ColonialOffice to the Foreign Office; and (b.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept full liability for the cost ofthe British High Commission in Iraq.The first of these proposals has been considered on various occasions in the past, and on each occasion has been ruled out as administratively impracticable. The main difficulty is Palestine. In matters of internal administration Palestine is governed like a Colony, and subordination to the Colonial Office is clearly appropriate. The same consideration applies, but with less force, in the case of Trans-Jordan, through which country Palestine is brought into such close contact with general Arabian affairs that her divorce from Iraq and Arabia would at present be in the highest degree inconvenient, if not actually unworkable. In short, Iraq affairs are inextricably tied up with those of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, and those countries have not yet reached a stage in their development when responsibility for their administration could with advantage be passed to the Foreign Office; thus, the ultimate responsibility for Iraq must for the present remain with the Colonial Office. When our quasi-mandatory responsibility for Iraq terminates and Iraq enters the League as an independent State, some alteration in the present procedure will in any -case be necessary. But, it is suggested, even then Iraqi susceptibilities could be satisfied by a purely superficial modification of the present arrangement. The case of Afghanistan is in point. Although the Foreign Office are nominally responsible for the affairs of that country, real responsibility is exercised by the India Office through a Foreign Office facade. In the case of Afghanistan a somewhat intricate procedure for the administration of current business has been adopted. This might with advantage be simplified in the case of Iraq. It would probably suffice if despatches from the British Representative in Iraq to His Majesty&apos;s Government were in every case addressed to the Foreign Office, and replies thereto issued over the signature of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The drafts of such replies could be prepared in the Colonial Office and sent over to the Foreign Office for recopying and signature. The Foreign Office would need to be consulted no more and no less than they are at present. The introduction of some such arrangement as that -suggested above need not necessarily await 1932. It might even, without undue administrative inconvenience, be introduced forthwith.
9. As regards (&amp;), the present position is that, in virtue of Article 13 of the Financial Agreement of 1924, the Iraq Government are nominally responsible for the full cost of the High Commission, although His Majesty&apos;s Government, in fact, contribute a moiety of the sum involved. The Iraq Government have never lost an opportunity to contest this arrangement, and on more than one occasion the Colonial Office have pressed the Treasury to accept the full cost of the High Commissioner and * his stafL, It may be argued that the High Commission still serves an important administrative function in Iraq, and it is, therefore, only right that the Iraq Government should bear part of its cost. This argument is not, however, one which is likely to impress ardent Iraqi nationalists. Certainly, the present arrangement, whereby responsibility for meeting the cost of British representation in a nominally independent State lies with the Government of that State, is anomalous and not unnaturally is repugnant to national sentiment. The additional cost involved to the British Exchequer is relatively-trivial, some  50,000 in all, and if Sir G. Clayton is right in supposing that a concession on this point, offered spontaneously now, and not wrung from us unwillingly in 1932 (when the present arrangement would in any case have to be abandoned), would really have an important influence upon Anglo-Iraq relations, then, it is submitted, the &quot; gesture &quot; would be cheap at the price.If, however, the view taken is that even this trifling financial concession is too high a price to pay for Iraqi goodwill, then it is suggested that Sir G. Clayton should at least be authorised formally to assure the Iraq Government that upon the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to accept full responsibility for the cost of the British Representative in Iraq and his staff.10. Before examining Sir G. Clayton&apos;s proposals for a comprehensive settle-ment, one or two relevant factors call for mention. In the first place, the recent publication of the proposals for an Anglo-Egyptian settlement (see extract in Appendix 2) is likely to have an important influence upon the attitude of the Iraq Government. They will undoubtedly expect to get at least as favourable terms for Iraq as those offered to Egypt. Regarded from the point of view of Imperial interests the position of the two countries is not dissimilar. Both countries occupy an important position o&apos;n Imperial lines of communication. In the case of Egypt it is the Suez Canal which is our principal concern; in the case of Iraq the Imperial air route to India. Just as for the purpose of protecting the Canal zone some British troops must be maintained more or less permanently m Egypt, so in the case of Iraq the permanent retention of a British garrison is necessary in order to safe-guard our air communications with India. In both countries it is important to preserve the predominance of British influence and to prevent foreign penetration or interference. It would be unwise to stretch the analogy too far, but there are other points of similarity and, there is at least a prima facie case for dealing with the two countries on similar lines. In point of fact, a great deal of the material embodied in the Exchange of Notes with the Egyptian Prime Minister could mutatis mutandis be reproduced in a settlement with Iraq.11. It may be argued that as the entry of Iraq into the League cannot take place until 1932, it would be premature now to consider the terms of the Treaty which will then have to be concluded. But as was explained in the Departmental Memorandum circulated with the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum of the 18th July (CP. 214 (29)), there is much preliminary work to be done before then. Judging by past experience the negotiation of a comprehensive settlement with Iraq will itself be a long and tedious business. The Iraq Government may be expected to bring into play all the oriental devices of evasion and delay. They will argue interminably about trivial points; they will quibble over words; and months will slip by without apparent progress. But apart from the delays at Baghdad, many other obstacles will have to be cleared away before Iraq can be proposed for membership of the League with any hope of success. French opposition must be overcome and the ground carefully prepared at Geneva. All this will take time, and the sooner His Majesty&apos;s Government decide upon the main principles which are to find a place in the final settlement with Iraq the more likely is this task to be carried through successfully by 1932.12. The general principles cited by Sir G. Clayton in paragraph 5 of his despatch as those which should govern our future relationship with Iraq appear unexceptionable.   It is, however, in the translation of these principles into Treaty
provisions that the difficulty is to be anticipated, and the following paragraph of the despatch at once raises a question of first importance. Iraq will certainly not wish to concede the use of her air and land communications, or accept the continued presence of British forces, unless in return for some quid pro quo in the form of promised military assistance in emergency. Clearly also His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot enter into an unconditional commitment to afford military assistance in all conceivable circumstances. The responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the defence of Iraq is, at present, conditioned by Article VIII of the Military Agreement of 1924.   The relevant portion of this Article reads as follows :  &apos;1 The Iraq G overnment shall not be entitled to the assistance of any forces maintained or controlled by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government against or for the suppression of any external aggression or any civil disturbance or armed rising, which shall, in the opinion of the High Commissioner, have been provoked or occasioned by action taken or policy pursued by the Iraq Government contrary to the advice or express wishes of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;It is doubtful whether the Iraq Government could be induced to accept the presence of British Forces in Iraq after 1932 on such terms. They would argue that a promise so qualified would be of little value to them, since, if it were at any time inconvenient for His Majesty&apos;s Government to come to the assistance of Iraq, they could always evade their obligation by representing that at some stage the Iraq Government had ignored their advice. In the case of Egypt it is not proposed to attach any such qualification to the promise of military support, and it is submitted that there is no real need to do so in the case of Iraq. The position would, it is suggested, be sufficiently safeguarded by including in any future settlement with Iraq provisions similar to those contained in paragraphs 4, 5, 7 and 14 of the proposals for an Anglo-Egyptian settlement (see Appendix 2). To the second of these might be added a provision on the lines of Article IV of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1927 : (&quot; There shall be full and frank consultation between the High Contracting Parties in all matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests&quot;). Something in the nature of Article X of the Military Agreement of 1924, whereby members of the British Forces are excluded from the jurisdiction of Iraqi Courts and are subject only to British Military Codes of Law, will also have to find a place in the future settlement with Iraq.13. Sir G. Clayton assumes that, if any British Air Force, be retained in Iraq, it will naturally be accommodated at the Hinaidi Aerodrome, which is situated some five miles from Baghdad. In the light of experience in Egypt, however, it seems extremely unlikely that the Iraq Government would willingly accept the presence of a foreign Air Force (with protective ground troops) so close to the capital of Iraq. One of the chief grievances of the Egyptian Government has been the presence of British troops in and around Cairo. A great deal of the past agitation in Egypt has.been directed towards securing the removal of the British garrison to a greater distance from the capital. This end has apparently been achieved, and it can scarcely be expected that the Iraq Government will be slow to follow Egjqofs example. It seems almost certain that the Iraq Government, if they are prepared to contemplate the retention of any British garrison in Iraq after 1932, will press very strongly for its removal from the vicinity of Baghdad. Probably they would not oppose the stationing of a British Air Force at the Shaiba Aerodrome, near Basra. They might even agree to provide an intermediate landing ground for use in emergency (possibly at Rutba), but it seems in the highest degree unlikely that they could be brought to agree to the permanent presence of British Forces at Hinaidi, which would have too much of the appearance of a foreign occupation.It is for the Air Ministry to say to what extent the concentration at Shaiba of the Air units likely to be retained in Iraq could be reconciled with the exigencies of Imperial defence; but, if s.uch a concentration would not involve serious difficulty, it is desirable that the withdrawal of the British Forces to Shaiba should be offered to the Iraq Government spontaneously by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not court a refusal by attempting to retain the Hinaidi Aerodrome.14. The view advanced in the latter part of paragraph 6 of Sir G. Clayton&apos;s despatch, that it would be unwise to enter into any formal commitment to afford military assistance to the Iraq Government in the event of internal disturbances.
seems to be eminently sound. Such a commitment would, it is submitted, be wholly unsuitable for inclusion in a settlement between two ostensibly sovereign and independent States, and would be as unpopular in Iraq as presumably it would be distasteful to public opinion in this country.15. Ill, paragraph 8 of his despatch, Sir G. Clayton discusses the means for ensuring the predominance of British influence in Iraq and for safeguarding the interests of British officials in the service of the Iraq Government. These two questions are to some extent inter-dependent, since so long as the Iraq Government continue to seek their foreign Advisers, both military and civil, in this country, British influence will predominate. Generally speaking, the British official is extremely popular throughout the country, and gets on admirably with his Iraqi colleagues. There has been, it is true, a certain amount of agitation in the Press aimed at reducing the number of British officials employed in Iraq. This agitation derives much of its support from the fact that the Iraq Government is at present compelled by Treaty to employ British officials. This is considered derogatory to Iraq. But once the element of compulsion were removed and the Iraq Government were free to employ as many and as few British officials as they liked, it seems probable that the purely artificial agitation against the British official would disappear, and the Iraq Government would not hesitate to recruit their foreign military and civil Advisers in this country. The position would, it is suggested, be adequately safeguarded by incorporating in the treaty with Iraq provisions similar to those in paragraphs 8 and 10 of the proposed Anglo-Egyptian settlement (see Appendix 2), and possibly reproducing the first part of Article XI of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1927 (&quot;Nothing in this Treaty shall affect the validity of the contracts concluded and in existence between the Iraq Government and British officials &quot;).16. In paragraphs 9 and 10 of his despatch, Sir G. Clayton raises the questions of the protection of the interests of foreigners in Iraq and the due discharge of Iraq&apos;s international obligations. He contemplates that the former question should be dealt with by separate Agreements between Iraq &quot;and the various Powers concerned&quot; (i.e., in practice, all Members of the League of Nations and the United States of America). This would seem an unnecessarily cumbersome method of procedure. One of the conditions attaching to the admission of a new Member of the League of Nations is that the candidate &quot; shall give effective guarantees of its sincere intention to observe its international obligations . . . .&quot; (Article I of the Covenant). Presumably Iraq, when applying for admission to the League, will have to give such guarantees, and it is to be presumed that observance of the principle of non-discrimination (at present embodied in Article XI of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922) will figure among the obligations which Iraq will have to guarantee to observe. Other international obligations would presumably be the various international instruments to which Iraq either has already acceded or is under obligation to accede, as defined in Articles VI and VII of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1927.17. Without presuming to suggest the precise form in which Iraq&apos;s application for League membership should be cast or the precise form in which the guarantees required by Article I of the Covenant should be given, since this is a matter upon which the advice of the Foreign Office alone would be authoritative, it is suggested that, whatever form of instrument be employed, it should be unilateral in character. Clearly His Majesty&apos;s Government should assume no responsibility whatever for the discharge of Iraq&apos;s international obligations after her entry into the League, and when drawing up the settlement between this country and Iraq, we should confine ourselves to safeguarding Imperial interests, and should avoid all direct or indirect responsibility for the protection of foreign interests (other than our own) in Iraq.18. An attempt has been made to sketch out on very general lines the main provisions to be included in a final settlement with Iraq. The picture is admittedly incomplete. There are many other outstanding questions not touched in this note (notably those mentioned in paragraph 2 of Sir G. Clayton&apos;s despatch) which will need to be disposed of. But these, in so far as they may not have been settled before 1932, can be relegated to subsidiary agreements. They are not of paramount importance and need find no place in the principal Treaty. It will doubtless be argued that a treaty of the kind suggested, a treaty of a permissive rather than a mandatory character, would not afford sufficient protection for vital Imperial interests. For this we should have to rely too much upon the goodwill or good sense of the Iraq Government.   There would be no Treaty safeguards to fall back upon
and no sanctions to invoke. The answer to this criticism is that the policy hitherto followed of demanding binding assurances to protect ourselves against every possible contingency, of tying down the Iraq Government in black and white on every con-ceivable question, and, in short, of always attributing the worst intentions to them instead of presuming some degree of goodwill, has not been markedly successful. It has engendered a spirit of distrust and suspicion. In the case of the abortive negotiations for the revision of the Financial and Military Agreements this policy led to a political crisis of some gravity, when for several months no Government could be found to take office in Iraq. Moreover, a multiplicity of treaty safeguards was possible only so long as our quasi-mandatory relationship with Iraq existed. It will be neither advisable nor possible when Iraq attains to complete independence. It is submitted that the final settlement with Iraq should be confined to essentials, and that for the satisfaction of other British interests we should rely upon the goodwill and good sense of the Iraq Government and upon the influence of our repre-sentative in the country.19.   To sum up, it is recommended that (1.) Sir G. Clayton should be authorised to communicate to the Iraq Govern-ment an unqualified undertaking to support Iraq&apos;s admission to the League in 1932;(2.) His Majesty&apos;s Government should, as from the beginning of the next financial year, accept full responsibility for the cost of the High Commission in Iraq;(3.) The Treaty to be concluded with the Iraq Government prior to Iraq&apos;s admission to the League should be based upon the proposals for an Anglo-Egyptian settlement and should follow the general lines indicated in this note;(4.) The Colonial Office should be authorised to concert with the other interested Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the preparation of a draft Treaty which, when approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government, should be communicated to the Iraq Government when in the opinion of the High Commissioner the time is opportune for opening negotiations.Middle East Department, Colonial Office, August 31, 1929.
Despatch from the High Commissioner for Iraq.(Secret.   B.) The Residency,My Lord,   &apos; Baghdad, July 22, 1929.I HAVE the honour, having now passed some months in this country and had an opportunity of studying the various problems which it presents, to submit the following appreciation of the situation.2.   I will preface my remarks by a recapitulation of some of the questions which are still unsettled : (a.) The extension or revision of the Military and Financial Agreements. (&amp;.) The ownership of the Iraq Railways, (c.) The formation of the Basra Port Trust.(d.) The establishment of a National Bank and the issue of an Iraqi currency. (e.) The consideration of means for securing the capital essential for economic development and urgent public works. (/.) The revision and improvement of the judicial system so as to render possiblethe abolition of the Judicial Agreement. (g.) The establishment of satisfactory relations between Iraq and Persia by theremoval   or   settlement   of   existing   grievances   and   questions   of disagreement. (h.) The delimitation of the Syro-Iraq frontier.(i.) The establishment of security, and, if possible, satisfactory relations withIbn Sa&apos;ud, on the southern desert frontier. (j.) The organization- of the Iraq Army, in accordance with the military requirements and financial possibilities of the country.These are some of the questions which demand early settlement if our relations with Iraq and the general situation of the country are to be placed on a really t satisfactory footing; and they form a sufficiently formidable list.3. But there is a major question of primary importance which requires immediate attention. His Majesty&apos;s Government are pledged to recommend Iraq for admission to the League of Nations in 1932 unless any serious and unforeseen check takes place in her political and economic progress in the meantime. The questions still at issue between Great Britain and Iraq may not all be disposed of by that date, but in the main they concern those two countries alone, and even if they are still outstanding, they will hardly furnish adequate reasons for refusing to recommend Iraq for admission to the League. It is, therefore, almost certain that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be called upon to fulfil their pledge in three years from now, and it is urgently necessary to decide what their future relations are to be with an independent Iraq, member of the League of Nations, and what Imperial and international interests it is necessary to safeguard in Iraq.4. I am taking it as an axiom that His Majesty&apos;s Government have made no change in their declared policy of working for the establishment of an independent Government of Iraq, friendly to and bound by gratitude and obligation to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, at the earliest possible date. Any reversal of that -policy is now impracticable, and, apart from moral considerations, can only lead to serious trouble.   The following observations are, therefore, made upon that basis.5. I venture to suggest that the first step is to decide what general principles it is necessary to safeguard in laying down our future relationship with Iraq, and then to see how best to secure them.To consider, first, Imperial interests.  They would seem to be :  (a.) Safe and open communications between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, and free transit over those communications in peace and war.(b.) Predominance of British influence in Iraq, or at least protection against any other foreign penetration or interference.(c.) The preservation of legitimate British interests in Iraq, to which must be added, to some extent, foreign interests if (b) is to be fully secured.[19856] c
The above broad principles appear to cover all necessary requirements, and it&apos; secured by treaty should enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to deal satisfactorily with any specific questions which may arise. What, then, should be provided for in that treaty in order that the principles enunciated above may be safeguarded ?6. For the conservation of Imperial communications it will be necessary to obtain from the Iraq Government an assurance such as that contained in Article 2 of the unratified Treaty of 1927, and guarantees of unstinted help and freedom to use air and land communications for military purposes in time of war or threat of war.A further requirement may be agreement to the maintenance in Iraq of a Royal Air Force and military station with an assurance of the necessary freedom of action and permanent tenure of barracks, buildings, &amp;c. This requirement depends on a decision as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government now desire to retain a British military force in Iraq, or whether the policy of early and complete withdrawal envisaged in Article 1 of the Military Agreement and Article 3 of the Financial Agreement still holds the field. If it is decided that a British Air Force should remain after the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations, it is submitted that ground troops for the protection of the Headquarters at Hinaidi should not be provided by the Iraq Army, but should be entirely under British control.In return Iraq will doubtless require assurances of help and protection in case of attack, and the assistance of the British military forces in Iraq in time of grave external danger. This necessitates yet another condition, namely, full and frank consultation between the two Governments in all matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests (see Article 4 of the Treaty of 1927).In this connection it is a matter for consideration whether, in certain exceptional circumstances, British forces should afford assistance in case of serious internal trouble. It would probably be wise to enter into no commitment in this respect, and to leave the question open for such action as circumstances may dictate. The more general the lines on Avhich any agreement is framed the less chance of undesirable entanglements.7. It is fair to presume that the Iraqi Government, once assured of an independent status and entry into the League of Nations, would not raise serious objection in principle to any of the above-mentioned requirements, though it is not for me to say how far they would be regarded as proper matters for inclusion in an Anglo-Iraqi Treaty by the League of Nations or by interested Foreign Powers.8. Freedom from other foreign intervention would seem adequately safeguarded by the Treaty itself, which would in essence be one of defensive alliance, but it would be necessary to safeguard the interests of existing British officials by repeating Article 11 of the Treaty of 1927, and, perhaps, to obtain an assurance that if foreign -officials and foreign advice are required Great Britain will be given the preference.9. The interests of foreigners would be-provided for by the usual instruments which deal with non-discrimination and the grant of most-favoured-nation treatment. Iraq would doubtless conclude separate agreements to this effect with the various Powers concerned, including Great Britain, on the lines of Article 9 of the Treaty of 1927. The permanence, unless changes are mutually agreed upon, of the arrange-ments which are to take the place of the Judicial Agreement might be secured by an arrangement providing that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be informed before-hand of any projects or proposals of the Iraqi Government which may concern the interests of foreigners in general and Great Britain in particular.10. To proceed now to consider international interests and the international obligations which Great Britain has undertaken on behalf of Iraq. They are dealt with in Articles 3, the last eight words of 4, 6, 7 and 9 of the Treaty of 1927. I do not know to what extent, if at all, Great Britain would remain responsible for the discharge of those obligations after the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations. Tt would seem that Iraq would become directly responsible to the League, as a. member of that body, in view of paragraph 6 of the decision of the Council of the League, dated the 27th September, 1924, which reads: ctin the event of Iraq being admitted to the League of Nations, the obligations hereby assumed by Hrs Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government shall terminate.&quot;Nevertheless, it might be thought advisable to obtain from Iraq, in her Treaty with Great Britain,&apos;ah undertaking to observe the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne, the Anglo-French Boundary Agreement and the San Rcmo Oil Agreement.11. Time is ^passing and there is not too much left if the ground is to be well prepared bv June. 1932.   But if any practical results can be achieved it is essential
that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be decided upon and clearly laid down. It is also necessary that the Iraq Government should know, what that policy is and be convinced that it is genuine, in order that all doubts may be dispelled and they may work in a spirit of confidence and co-operation for settlement of outstanding questions and for agreement in regard to future relations.The establishment of confidence is an essential preliminary to co-operation in the work of settlement of outstanding questions and to an agreed definition of the future relations between Great Britain and Iraq which will be satisfactory to both parties.12. In this connection, I would suggest that, once the policy is decided upon, there are certain gestures which, if made by His Majesty&apos;s Government spontaneously and without further solicitation&apos;by the Iraq Government, would go far to convince Iraq of the genuineness of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;? Government. I venture here to observe, in parenthesis, that any voluntary and unsolicited concessions, which His Majesty&apos;s Government may find it possible to make, will do much to form those ties of gratitude and obligation with which it is hoped to bind Iraq to Great Britain; whereas, those same concessions following upon lengthy, and perhaps acrimonious, negotiations, will be apt to produce the contrary effect and to be regarded as the successful result of bargaining with a crafty and unscrupulous opponent.The gestures which I have in mind are the following :  13.   First. It will be remembered that in course of conversations which took place in connection with the formation of the present Ministry, King&apos;Faisal made certain proposals with a view to rendering more clear and definite the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in &quot;regard to the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations.  After consideration of King Faisahs proposals,His Majesty&apos;s Government expressed their willingness &quot;to-inform the Council of the League of Nations at the earliest opportunity (when notifying that body that it is not proposed to proceed with the Treaty of 1927) that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, unless there has been any serious check in the political or economic progress of the country in the meantime, to recommend to the Council at their June session in 1932, by which time various important internal and external questions which are still under settlement should have been disposed of, that Iraq should forthwith be admitted to membership of the League.&quot;   King Faisal and those prominent Iraqis capable of forming a Ministry found this formula inadequate, pointing out that the two phrases which are printed in italics still preserved that element of doubt and uncertainty as to the real intentions of Flis Majesty&apos;s Government, which it-was essential to remove if the confidence of the country was to be secured.    His Majesty&apos;s Government found themselves unable to give way, the proposals were dropped for the time being and a new Ministry was eventually formed with a general, and somewhat vague programme.which, while avoiding direct allusion to contentious&apos; political issues, took care to reaffirm the principles on which the previous Ministry had found it necessary to resign.I fully appreciate the reasons which moved His Majesty&apos;s Government to refuse&apos; the amendments to their proposed declaration, which were asked for by King Faisal and his advisers, and to reject the arguments which they put forward. Nevertheless,. I venture to suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be well advised, now7 to reconsider their decision and to authorise the early communication to the Iraqi Government at a suitable moment of an assurance couched in the following terms : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to inform the League of Nations at the earliest opportunity (when notifying that body that it is not proposed to proceed with the Treaty of 1927) that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to recommend to the Council at their June session in 1932 that Iraq should forthwith be admitted to membership of the League.&quot;This statement would not in fact entail any greater commitment than exists at present. If any check to the political or economic progress of Iraq were to take place in the meantime which would warrant a withdrawal of their promise by Flis Majesty&apos;s Government, it would be of so serious and obvious a nature as to provide full justification. Moreover, I would not wish to attach to the assurance any condition beyond that of extension in practice until 1932 of the relevant portions of the existing Military and Financial Agreements.[19856] &apos; D
14. Secondly. There are two questions which have a very real effect on the Iraqi attitude of mind.   They are : (a.) The direction of the policy of His Majcsty&apos;s Government in regard to Iran by the Colonial Office as opposed to the Foreign Office; and(b.) The laying upon the Iraq Government of full responsibility for the cost of this High Commission.These may seem comparatively unimportant matters, but they do not so appear to Iraqis, by whom Colonial Office control and payment for the British High Commis-sion are regarded as definite signs of a permanent subservience and a negation of independence which has never been imposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government even on Egypt. As a matter of financial arrangement, I believe that the Iraqi Government would probably be willing to pay a contribution of half the expenses of the High Commission in return for services rendered, provided the whole expenditure were borne in theory by His Majesty&apos;s Government. But the reverse arrangement is regarded with the utmost dislike.In both these cases I presume that changes in procedure will become necessary when Iraq is admitted to membership of the League, but to make them now spontaneously would have an effect which could never be obtained if they were given -under force of circumstances or in order to gain some specific advantage.15. The present Ministry is unlikely to last long, and has only survived a determined effort on the part of King Faisal to force their resignation by tacitly agreeing to the formation, in a month or two from now, of a new Ministry under Sir Abdul Muhsin Beg al-Sa&apos;dun, who will hardly be able to renounce the principles on which he resigned before, and to retain office for any length of time unless he can point to some improvement in the situation.There is at present a very distinctly better feeling among all parties in Iraq, ;and a hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government really mean to make a definite move forward in pursuance of the policy which they have always publicly proclaimed. But, if nothing is done, disappointment will prevail once more, and the situation will relapse again into the deadlock from which there now seems some chance of escaping.16. It will doubtless be said in various quarters that Iraq is not ready for any great advance beyond the stage which she has already reached, that British guidance is still essential and that any relaxation of control will result in the undoing of much of the work accomplished. It may be so to some extent, but Iraq has reached a stage at which further progress in self-Government and self-reliance can only be achieved as a result of a system of trial and error. She will only realise and learn to surmount her difficulties by being able to face them herself. Thus, she will tend to turn to Great Britain as a friend and ready helper; whereas a policy of continued repression will turn national enthusiasm into the channel of hostility towards the Power which they will come to regard as the obstacle in the path of their progress.17. In this connection I would refer to the question of responsibility for the maintenance of internal order and for the defence of Iraq from external aggression which forms the subject of Article 1 of the Military Agreement. This has now become one of the main points at issue from the Iraqi point of view. It is, as things have turned out, unfortunate that it should have been found necessary to insert this Article at all, as it lies at the root of Iraqi objection to the whole Agreement.Iraqi public opinion maintains that that responsibility has now fallen -automatically upon Iraq, and, whether or not she is able to discharge it, she has, in fact, assumed it. His Majesty&apos;s Government argue that, as Iraq is not able fully to discharge that responsibility, she cannot be held to have assumed it. From a practical point of view, this question may be regarded as purely academic, and can surely be dropped. It is not a question of theoretical responsibility but of actual fact in certain circumstances which may, or may not, arise.IS. It will be admitted, I believe,&quot; that Iraq is now able to maintain internal order in normal circumstances. Whether, in the event of abnormal circumstances arising, she will still be able to do so must depend entirely on the magnitude and circumstances of the crisis with which she may be faced. In many countries which are fully independent internal upheavals have taken place with which the Govern-ment of the day has proved unable to cope.19. - As regards defence from external aggression, it is obvious that any real threat against Iraq would be of so serious a nature as to be quite beyond her power to deal with without assistance.   She theoretically assumes responsibility, but is
almost certainly unable to discharge it when the crisis arises, and must seek for help  presumably from Great Britain. If His Majesty&apos;s Government refuse to admit the responsibility of Iraq in such Case they must assume it themselves. Are they prepared to do so indefinitely and to undertake to the full the commitment that would be entailed ? Surely the logical and sound position from the point of view of defence from external aggression is that both countries are deeply interested in preserving the integrity of Iraq and, in case of attack, will combine whole-heartedly for ijer protection. It will not be a question of who is responsible, but of ensuring that both parties co-operate, with such forces as they are able to bring to bear, in the face of a common danger.20. There is one more very important matter to which I wish to allude before bringing this despatch to &quot;a close. It is the urgent necessity of finding the means by which Iraq may be enabled to develop her potential assets and make that stride forward in economic development for which ten years of steady spade-work have now prepared the way.The more vocal elements in the country still place political questions in the forefront and shout the time-honoured slogans, But the great mass of the people of every class, from the King to the poorest peasant, have their eyes fixed on the prospect of economic and commercial progress which is now beginning to open up before them. It is my belief that Iraq is now ripe for development and ready to digest a reasonable amount of capital. If concrete and substantial signs of early development in these directions should be forthcoming, I am convinced that politics will surely, even if slowly, recede into the background, as it would appear that they are now doing in Egypt. On the other hand, &quot;hope deferred maketh the heart sick,&quot; and a continuance of the present state of comparative stagnation will inevitably produce the opposite result.21. I have written on very general lines in this despatch and have purposely avoided entering into detail. To discuss the various questions alluded to in paragraph 2 of this despatch would be out of place at this juncture. My object is to emphasise the necessity of acting now, while the situation is favourable and there is yet time, instead of letting things slide until the last moment when an unfavour--able atmosphere and the necessity of a hasty settlement may lead to the sacrifice of important Imperial interests.I have, &amp;c.

Proposals for an Anglo-Egyptian Settlement.1.THE military occupation of Egypt by the forces of His Britannic Majesty is terminated.2.An alliance is established between the High Contracting Parties in consecration of their friendship, their cordial understanding and their good relations.3.Egypt, being anxious to become a member of the League of Nations, will j)resent in the conditions prescribed by article 1 of the Covenant a request for admission to the League, which His Britannic Majesty undertakes to support.[19856] d 2
.4.Should any dispute with a third State produce a situation which involves a risk of a rupture with that State, the High Contracting Parties will concert together with a view to the settlement of. the said dispute by peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of&apos; Nations and of any other international obligations which may be applicable to the case.5.Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes not to adopt in foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or will create difficulties for the other Party thereto. In pursuance of this undertaking they will not oppose each other&apos;s policy in foreign countries, nor conclude with a third Power any agree-ment of a political character which might be prejudicial to the interests of the other Party.6.His Britannic Majesty recognises that the responsibility for the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt devolves henceforth upon the Egyptian Government. His Majesty the King of Egypt will ensure the fulfilment of his obligations in this respect.7.Should, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 4 above, either of the High Contracting Parties become engaged in war, the other High Contracting Party will, subject always to the provisions of paragraph 14 below, immediately come to his aid in the capacity of an ally. In particular, His Majesty the King of Egypt will, in the event of war or menace of war, furnish to His Britannic Majesty on Egyptian territory all the facilities and assistance in his power, including the use of his ports, aerodromes and means of communication.8.In view of the desirability of identity in training and methods between the Egyptian and British armies,His Majesty the King of Egypt undertakes that, should he deem it necessary to have recourse to foreign military instructors, these shall be chosen from amongst British subjects.9.In order to facilitate and secure to His Britannic Majesty the protection of she Suez Canal as an essential means of communication between the different parts of the British Empire, His Majesty the King of Egypt authorises His Britannic Majesty to maintain upon Egyptian territory in localities to be agreed upon, to the east of longitude 32Q E., such forces as His Britannic Majesty considers necessary for this purpose. The presence of these forces shall not constitute in any manner an occupation and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rights of Egypt.10.In view of the friendship between the two countries and of the alliance contemplated in the present proposals, the Egyptian Government when engaging the -services of foreign officials will as a rule engage British subjects.11.His Britannic Majesty recognises that the capitulatory regime now existing in Egypt is no longer in accordance with the spirit of the times and with the present state of Egypt.His Britannic Majesty accordingly, undertakes to use all his influence with the Powers possessing capitulatory rights in Egypt to obtain, in conditions which will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreigners, the transfer to the Mixed Tribunals of the jurisdiction of the existing Consular Courts, and the application of Egyptian legislation to foreigners.
12.In view of the friendship between the High Contracting Parties and ot the alliance contemplated in the present proposals, His Britannic Majesty will be represented at the Court of His Majesty the King of Egypt by an Ambassador, duly accredited, and His Majesty the King of Egypt will reserve the highest diplomatic rank at his Court to the representative of His Britannic Majesty.His Majesty the King of Egypt will be represented at the Court of St. James&apos;s by an Ambassador.13.While reserving liberty to conclude new conventions in future modifying the conventions of 1899, the High Contracting Parties agree that the status of the Sudan shall be that resulting from the said conventions. Accordingly, the Governor-General shall continue to exercise on the joint behalf of the High Contracting Parties the powers conferred upon him by the said conventions.14.Nothing in the present proposals is intended to or shall in any way prejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or may devolve, upon either of the High Contracting Parties under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty for the Renunciation of War signed at Paris on the 27th August, 1928.15.The High Contracting Parties agree that any difference on the subject of the application or the interpretation of the provisions of the present proposals which they are unable to settle by direct negotiation shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations.16.At any time after the expiration of a period of twenty-five years from the coming into force of a treaty based on the above proposals such modification of its terms as may be deemed appropriate in the circumstances as they then exist may be made by agreement between the High Contracting Parties.APPENDIX III.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies.Dated 1st September, 1929.(Received 3-20 a.m. 2nd September, 1929.)IMPORTANT.   No. 299 of 1st September.Taufiq Beg Suwaidi&apos;s resignation on account of incompatibility with the King which must in any case have come to pass when Parliament met, has produced a deadlock. The King had reckoned on Abdul Muhsin taking office, but latter is unwilling to do so; nor in present circumstances could he form a Cabinet which would have much hope of facing Parliament successfully. Abdul. Muhsin&apos;s argument, and that of other suitable candidates for office, is that country, especially after the Egyptian conversations, will expect any Government taking office to approach His Majesty&apos;s Government immediately with a view to securing a definite assurance as to the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations and a satisfactory arrangement of the relations of the past and future between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Iraq. On the other hand, they are, in the light of past experience, unwilling to undertake such*a programme, being afraid that they will only find His
Majestys Government unwilling to meet them, and thus a ministerial crisis will be provoked on the grounds of political disagreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government.I have studied situation, and although personal elements enter into question to some extent, I believe above statement to be based on correct premises.To turn to general situation, I find it still good, but gradually deteriorating as a result of doubt and uncertainty as to His Majesty&apos;s Governments real policy. Until that doubt is dispelled, no improvement can be expected, and none but ineffective and makeshift ministries can be formed.Now to come to events in Palestine, which have profoundly stirred the country. So far there has been no disturbance with which police have not been able to deal, but Friday last might have seen very serious outbreak if careful precautionary measures had not been taken with a view to nipping trouble promptly in the bud. Up to the present there is no indication of undue excitement in the provincial towns or country districts, but news and propaganda travels slowly from the centre.I would recall the fact that our available ground troops for dealing with urban disturbance consist only of two armoured car sections at Baghdad, three at Basra (which are designed to watch southern desert situation), and one at Mosul. There are also two Assyrian infantry battalions, but they are mainly required on the Kurdish frontier, and there are only about five hundred men in Baghdad, including recruits; in any case, to use them in the streets against an Arab mob would only provoke trouble which it was desired to prevent. We are, therefore, largely dependent in the towns on the local police, with the Iraq Army in reserve.I am not thus setting forth situation in any alarmist spirit, but I cannot ignore the lessons of 1920, and I desire to emphasise urgent necessity for a strong and responsible ministry which will co-operate effectively in maintaining control over the country, and will also tackle various questions which require settlement.In order to obtain such a Ministry I must have something in my hand to offer them, and in this connection I draw attention my despatch of 22nd July, Secret, B. I believe it will suffice if I am authorized to give assurance suggested in paragraph 13 of that despatch. I recommend now, however, that September 1931 be substituted for June 1932. The actual difference is not great, but the effect of advancing date from 1932 to 1931 would be considerable, and the gesture would be in accordance with principle recommended in paragraph 12 of the same despatch.In conclusion, I beg that this be treated as a matter of extreme urgency. The moment has come for immediate decision, whether to advance on generous and liberal lines or to remain stationary with the possible early consequence of being obliged to reinforce our military forces in the country by an adequate proportion of ground troops. I beg that I may be promptly informed of any important developments of events or policy in Palestine. Up to the present I have been entirely dependent on wireless News Agencies and on garbled and exaggerated reports which come across from Syria by the desert route. The Air Officer Commanding, to whom I have shown this telegram, concurs.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the HighCommissioner for Iraq.(Sent 7-10 p.m. 2nd September. 1929.) No. 254, Important.Personal, for Sir G. Clayton,   Your telegram No. 299 of 1st September.I appreciate gravity of situation, and your proposals will be laid before the Cabinet at the earliest possible moment. You will realise, however, extreme difficulty of obtaining immediate decision at a time when Premier and Foreign Secretary are at Geneva and other members of Cabinet are dispersed.It would be of assistance if I could be given some indication of date beyond which you consider that decision cannot be safely delayed, i.e., of period during which you can continue to temporize without danger of crisis becoming acute and situation getting out of hand. Passfield.
oParaphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies.&apos; Dated 4th September, 1929.(Received 3-28 p.m. 4th September, 1929.)No. 304, Important.Personal   Reference your personal telegram No. 254.Difficulty in obtaining immediate decision in existing circumstances is fully realised, but I trust it may not be long delayed. Outgoing Ministry is still functioning from day to day in routine matters, but is unwilling to assume any serious responsibilities. Yesterday I succeeded in inducing them to suppress, under provisions of the Press Law, two vernacular newspapers which persisted in publishing mendacious and inflammatory news, but I had some difficulty in doing so. Country is quiet at present, but in Baghdad there is considerable tension which may spread, and, of course, strong sympathy with Palestine Arabs which agitators might make use of at any moment. I fear that I am unable to give any definite date beyond which I consider decision cannot be safely delayed. It is impossible to foresee what Avill happen from day to day, as all depends upon the course of events in Palestine and effect they may produce here. In the meantime, you may rely upon all possible vigilance being observed and all possible measures being taken short of exciting undue alarm. I am temporizing on the question of a Ministry, and hope to get present Ministers to continue functioning for some days longer.
