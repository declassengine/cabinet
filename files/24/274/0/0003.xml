Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1938.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 3(38).CABINET.THE STIFFENING OF MERCHANT SHIPS FOR defensive armament.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.WITH reference to Cabinet 36 (37), Conclusion 12, of the 6th October last, I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a Memorandum on the acceptance by shipowners of the Governments proposals for the stiffening of merchant ships for defensive armament.DUFF COOPER,January 6. 1938.Memorandum.THE decision reached by the Cabinet on 6th October, 1937, regarding the liability for the cost of incorporating stiffening in merchant vessels to enable them to take a defensive armament, has now been promulgated to the shipping community at two special meetings held at the Admiralty. At these meetings the owners of both liner and tramp tonnage present unanimously agreed to support the Government proposals and to recommend their general adoption. Meetings of shipowners have also been held at Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff and Hull and at each place the local association passed a unanimous resolution adopting the proposals.The Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom and the Liverpool Steam-ship Owners&apos; Association have since met and passed resolutions accepting the proposals and recommending to their members their general adoption. It can now be stated, therefore, that the co-operation of the shipowners in executing the Government policy is assured. Moreover, the President of the Shipbuilding-Conference has promised the full co-operation of his Association.In accepting the Governments proposals the shipowners have agreed to incorporate stiffening, at their own expense, in vessels of over 500 tons gross which they may build in the next two or three years. Such stiffening will be carried out under Admiralty supervision and in general will provide for the mounting of two guns in vessels of over 1,600 tons gross and one gun in vessels between 500 and 1,600 tons gross.The negotiations have been conducted in the most cordial atmosphere and the Admiralty have obtained the greatest possible assistance from the Board of Trade throughout.As a result of these developments, work in regard to stiffening ships offered by their owners is already making good progress, and it is anticipated that this will be accelerated when the Government proposals become more generally known.With this object in view a memorandum has now been issued by the Admiralty after consultation with the Board of Trade to all shipowners, setting out the proposals and .the details of the procedure which they should adopt to put them into effect.
