f-J fc/ v-&apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVLRI^lViENT. ) SECRET.3. P.  21(38). COPY NO.Cabinet, evidence bill.Memorandum by the Lord ChancelloroI invite the attention of my colleagues to a Bill which has been introduced by Lord Maugham in the House of Lords to amend the law of evidence in the direction of increasing the use of documents, chiefly for the sake of their evidential value hut partly also to save the expense of calling witnesses.Lord Maugham&apos;s original proposals were considered some time ago by the Council of Supreme Court Judges and were referred by the Council to a committee of judges consisting of Lord Justice G-reer (chairman), the late Lord Justice Avory, Mr.  Justice (now Lord) Roche, Mr. Justice (now Lord) Maugham,  and Mr. Justice Langton,      The report of the Committee took the form of a Bill drafted by Parliamentary Counsel..The Bill came before the Home Affairs Committee (H.A.C. 4th Conclusions (32) para.3) and was included in the agenda for the Cabinet, but discussion was reserved at the request of the Lord Chancellors, mainly,  I understand, because there was some doubt how far the bill ought to apply to criminal proceedings (Cabinet 15(32)).When Lord Maugham gave evidence before the Royal Commission on the Despatch of Business at Common Law, he laid the Bill before the Commissioners, who stated in their Report (Cmd 5C65 of 1936, para.  233) that they had no hesitation in giving the Bill a general approval and in recommending its introduction in Parliament as soon as opportunity offered.
Cj &apos;\j   jThe Bill has now &quot;been modified &quot;by the restriction of the first clause to civil proceedings.)    For further information as to the usefulness of the Bill and as to the contents of the several clauses, I cannot do better than to refer my colleagues to Lord Maugham&apos;s Memorandum which is annexed hereto.The Bill in its present form has mv general approval, and I ask for authority to give it a favourable reception in the House of Lords, in the hope that it may &quot;be found possible to find time for its passage through the House of Commons, hut without giving any pledge to that effect at the present time.(Intd.)    H.4th February.  1938.
9 ft (j v -ANNEX. EVIDENCE BILL.MEMORANDUM BY LORD IvlAUG-HAM.ause 1. This clause, which is limited to civil cases, dealswith the documentary evidence of facts, and would admit large classes of documents as evidence which at present are excluded.Generally speaking, our lav/ of evidence in the past has attributed extraordinary potency to the oath of the v/itness and has, with few exceptions, refused to admit docu-ments or records of any kind (however cogent) because the writer has not sworn to the truth of the statements.    The result is that the Court is often confronted with the com-pletely opposed and irreconcilable statements of witnesses in cases where existing documents,  if admissible, would throw most valuable light upon the matter.    Without regard to the question whether deliberate perjury is rife in present-day Courts,  every lawyer of experience is aware that parole evidence is often mos-^ unsatisfactory;    for the recollection of witnesses is too often uncertain and unreliable,  and if, as too often happens, they have taken a side,  they either colour the truth, sometimes unconsciously, or as the result of suggestions made to them before- they come into Court, they&apos; really persuade themselves that something has happened as to which they have no real knowledge at all.    There are numerous cases in which the Court may be said to long for a conteraporary record in writing, but is unable to obtain it because of the present strictness of our rule as to evidence not on oath.    The exceptions to the rule (apart from ad-missions) are mainly (l) declarations (so-called) against interest, and (2) declarations made in the course of business
e) Vi . Jor professional duty;  and in each of these two cases the person who made the statement must he proved to he dead. Death is an excellent reason for not calling a witness, hut most people will agree that it does not add to the real value of his statement, and that it ought to he admitted in evidence (if otherwise relevant)  if there is a sufficient reason for not calling him.Let us take as an example the classical case of Price v. Torrington.    The drayman who delivered the beer and made the entry in his hook was dead.    But suppose he could not he found, or was beyond the seas, or again, suppose that the cost of calling him as a witness was about as much as the sum at stake in the action,  is it reasonable to exclude the entry, which may he the only means of proving the delivery of the beer?Or take the other leading case:    that of Higham v. Ridgway. and suppose that the man-midwife Was not dead but was insane or so ill that he could not he called,  is it reasonable to exclude the entry of the date of birth?Almost everyone will agree that the lav; on these subjects ought to be amended in some respects.    It may be useful to remember that the law of evidence is almost entirely judge-made,  and that it has grown up in the most illogical and haphazard fashion.    Anyone, for instance, would guess that our modern exceptions to the great rule excluding hearsay v/ere formulated as such after the principle of exclusion was established.    In fact, it is not so.    The rules as to declarations made by deceased persons are much older than the rule rejecting hearsay evidence, which is not older than the year 16Y0, or thereabouts.The Committee of Judges who considered the law of evidence in 1931, and on whose proposals this Bill is founded, were desirous of admitting writings or documents made ante litem motarn by persons with personal knowledge of the facts,
cv&apos; U ^whether they were against interest or made in the course of duty or not.    They desired to alter the rule excluding hear-say as little as possible;    but not to exclude documentary evidence where the writer cannot he called whether because of death or of some other reason.    On consideration it seemed to be impossible to deal with the subject at all adequately with-out allowing any writing by a dead person to he put in evidence (for what it is worth) if the person had first-hand knowledge of the fact to be proved and made his written statement ante litem motam.    Every counsel of experience is well acquainted with the tricks and devices used to get in writings of this kind either by cross-examination or otherwise.    The document is sometimes of conclusive evidential value.If documents made by deceased persons are to be admitted with the safeguards suggested, what is to be done as regards like documents made by persons who cannot reasonably be called? The Committee of Judges thought it right to proceed on con-servative lines in regard to such cases, and to maintain the principle that the best evidence must he given of which the nature of the case admits.    This involves that the writer of any document must he called unless it is difficult or impos-sible to do so.A word of explanation may be required as to clause l(l) (i)(b) of the Bill which is the only place where there is a relaxation of the rule excluding statements not within the personal knowledge of the writer.    At present no continuous record, however carefully and systematically kept, is admis-sible in evidence except in the comparatively rare cases above referred to.    Suppose it is desired to prove that a certain person was in hospital during particular dates.    The hospital registrar, who keeps the book, enters it up from sheets made up by nurses or others,  and the sheets are des-troyed.    The register is therefore inadmissible even if the registrar is dead.    In such a case really cogent evidence is being rejected.    It is true that in some cases theevidential weight of the record may be small;    but that-iii-
seems to &quot;be no reeson for excluding such a record in all cases.      It should be remembered that if the record happens to contain entries against interest (e.g., a receipt of salary) it is admissible under existing law,  though in truth its probable value is not thereby increased.Attention may be drawn to the second half of subsection (5) Clause 1, which enabled the judge,  in cases, tried with a jury,  to reject statements made admissible by the clause if he thinks their admission is inexpedient in the interests of justice.      This safeguard may perhaps go some way to meet the fears of those who apprehend that juries *vill attach undue weight to such documents, lause 2. Clause 2 is inserted as a reminder to inexperiencedjudicial officers end arbitrators that documents coming within the Act are admitted with all possible qualifications as to their weight.      For example,  a document made contemporaneously with the facts stated must prime, facie have much greater value than one made after a lapse of time, lause 3. Clause 5 is not of great importance, because in ourlaw so few deeds require to be attested, though in practice they nearly always are.      In those exceptional cases where deeds require attestation great expense is sometimes caused by searches for an attesting witness.      The present rule is inflexible and unreasonable,  and it leads to injustice, lause 4. Clause 4 speaks for itself.      Forgery of deeds and otherlike documents is so rare in this country that a presumption to save expense may well be made after 20 years.      It may be noted that the period necessary to acquire a title to real estate by mere possession is now only 12 years, lause 5. Clause 5 removes a doubt as to the power of the RuleCommittee of the Supreme Court to make a rule repealing the proviso to the existing Order&apos;XXXVII, Rule 1.      That proviso gives to a party who can satisfy the Court that he bona fide desires the production of a witness for cross-examination an
absolute right to object to affidavit evidence being used at the trial unless che witness is either called or is definitely-unavailable.      The existing rule-making power is contained in section ninety-nine of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, I9S5 (see, in particular, paragraph(i)), and is in wide terms;    but in view of the long standingxof Order XXXVII, Rule i,  in its present form    (it is as oldas the Supreme Court itself)  it is thought that it -would besafer to put the power of the Rule Committee to alter thepractice beyond doubt.      Similar provision in made as respects County Courts.Iauses6 Clauses 5 and 7 do not appear to require comment,nd 7.There have been many proposals in the past for the widening of the law as respects the admission in evidence of documents.      The present Bill is put forward as an attempt to carry these proposals into effect with the necessary safeguards.      Some may think the Bill goes too far and some that it does not go far enough.      The subject is full of difficulties.      On the one hand it must be conceded that any extension of the rules as to the admissibility of documents may now and again lead to the fabrication of evidence;    but that may be done now in connection with declarations against interest.      Perjury is not uncommon and forgery is not un-known,  as things are, yet in most cases they are detected. The manufacture of documentary evidence with the safeguards provided       the Bill will not be easy and will be attended with many risks.      On the other band those who think that the measure is unduly cautious may be reminded that in such a vital matter as the rules of evidence it is safer to proceed with much circumspection.      If experience shows that the Act is a beneficial one, further amendments of the law can be introduced.      In present conditions there isThe rule has recently been altered in form, but not, so far as this point is concerned,  in substance.
little chance of the measure becoming law if it is opposed, and this obviously indicates that a moderate reform may have more chance of becoming useful than a more ambitious one.In conclusion it should be evident that no such Act oan be free from imperfections, which will be revealed in the light of actual experience.      All that can reasonably be expected is that on the whole the measure will tend to further the cause of justice and,  in come cases at least, will diminish the cost of obtaining it.
