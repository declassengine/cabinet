I seek the concurrence of the Cabinet to the introduction of a short Bill dealing with the procedure for the compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities.    A Bill on this subject is called for, partly owing to^statements which have been made on behalf of the Government in connection with the extension from year to year by means of Expiring Laws Acts of Section 2 of the Public Works Facilities Act,  1930,  and partly in connection with the decision which has just been taken by the Cabinet in regard to public capital expenditure (Cabinet Paper CP.7(38)  and Cabinet 2(38) Conclusion 5).&apos;2.      Broadly speaking, Parliament has laid down two alternative procedures* for the compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities s-(1)      acquisition byway of Provisional Order,  i.e., an order made by a Government Department and scheduled to a Bill which has to be passed under the ordinary local legislation procedure;    and(2)      acquisition by way of Compulsory Purchase Order, i.e., an Order made by the acquiring local authority and confirmed (usually after a local inquiry) by the appropriate Government Department, but not requiring Parliamentary confirmation.*Under one or two Acts compulsory acquisition of land can be effected by means of &quot;Special Orders&quot;, i.e., Orders requiring approval by way of affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament.1.
3.     The main purposes for which, under the permanent law, local authorities are authorised by public statutes to acquire land, by means of the Provisional Order and Compulsory Purchase Order procedures, respectively,  are set out in an appendix.      It is difficult to discover any principle on which the one procedure rather than the other has been applied to a particular subject matter, and an examination of the Statute Book makes it clear that the adoption of one procedure or the other in any particular case has depended almost entirely on the accident of the date of the governing legislation.     Thus, the Public Health services (to which Provisional Order procedure applies) derive from 1875 and have remained largely unaltered*.     All the codes applying the simpler procedure of Compulsory Purchase Order either date from or have been substantially enlarged and amended in, the present century.There are few instances where Provisional Order procedure for the compulsory acquisition of land has been incorporated in Acts passed during the present century (other than Acts which are wholly or mainly consolidating measures), and these cases are of no practical importance because alternative procedures have subsequently become available and are in fact used.*The question of substituting C.P.O. procedure for Provisional Order procedure was considered in connection with the Public Health Act, 1936, but, as this was in the main a consolidating measure, it was thought that the substitution would be too drastic an alteration of the law.
4.      The advantages of the simpler procedure are considerable.     Broadly speaking,  the preliminary expenses of a local inquiry held by the appropriate Government Department are common to both procedures.      The Provisional Order procedure, however, involves in addition:-(i)      in a case where the Order is unopposed, Parliamentary fees amounting to about  35;    and (ii)      in a case where it is opposed,  the same fees,together with the cost of the procedures before the Parliamentary Committee.      These costs vary within wide limits, but a sum of  300 to  400 would not be unusual.A further substantial advantage of the Compulsory Purchase Order procedure lies in the matter of time.      A Provisional Ordsr must be embodied in a Bill before Whitsuntide. Consequently, unless the decision to purchase the land happens to be taken at the right time of year, a long delay must occur before&quot;the powers are available.      A Compulsory Purchase Order can be made and confirmed at any time iIn connection with the time factor, I may call mycolleagues&apos;  attention to the following passage in paragraph 94of the First Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on public Capital Expenditure  (P.C;S.(37)10):-&quot;V7e &quot;would emphasise again that the success or failure of the policy we have proposed must depend in a very large degree on the speed with which it is possible to effect transition from.the phase of reduction of public capital expenditure to the phase of acceleration.      This,  in turn, will depend upon the extent to which the necessary preparations are carried out in the intervening years. These preparations include both the acquisition of sites for the works subsequently to be put in hand, and the drawing up of detailed plans and specifications.&quot;5.      The Public ,forks Facilities Act, 1930, was a temporary measure passed in order to facilitate the speedy execution ofworks designed to contribute to the relief of unemployment.
Section 2 of the Act, as originally enacted, applied both to local authorities and to statutory undertakers, and was dueto expire on the 31st December, 1932.      It has,  in fact, been continued by successive Expiring Laws Acts until the31st December, 1.938, but the reference to statutory undertakerswas-allowed to drop in the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, 1936,and the section, therefore, now applies only to localauthorities,  the term being widely defined.6.      The main purpose of the section is to enable the appropriate Government Department to authorise by means of a Compulsory Purchase Order the acquisition of land by a local authority in any case in which the authority could be authorised to acquire the land by an Order, whether made with or without the approval of Parliament, under some enactment in operation at the date of the passing ox the Act.      In substance, therefore the section permits the local authority with the concurrence of the Department to substitute the simpler procedure of Compulsory Purchase Order for that of Provisional Order.7.      The powers of the section have been freely used, most of the Orders made under it falling within the respective spheres ox my own Department and the Ministry of Transport. The Orders made under the section by the Ministry of Health are as follows  (figures covering England and V/ales only): -Total Ho .Ho.  since 1st January,  1936.Public Health17982Town Halls and Municipal Offices (S.125, Local Government Act,  1933)2819Mental Hospitals,  etc.52Mental Deficiency Institutions21Poor Law10Totals215104

In the course of the passage of the Expiring Laws Bills in 1936 and 1937 the view was expressed in the House of Lords (in particular by the Lord Chairman) that the proper course for the Government to take would be either to allow the section to expire or to make it part of the permanent lav/.      On behalf of the Government it was pointed out that in a number of recent statutes,  e.g., the Restriction of Ribbon Development Act, 1935, and the Air Navigation Act, 1936,  the procedure of Compulsory Purchase Order had been introduced as regards the subject matter of those Acts and accordingly that to that extent the Government had, in fact,  put Section 2 of the Act of 1950 on a permanent footing.     And, further, during the passage through the Lords of both these Expiring Laws Bills undertakings to deal with the matter on a more comprehensive basis were given on behalf of the Government (see Hansard 15th December, 1936, col. 894, and 16th November, 1937,  cols 107-8).9.      I am advised that the simplest course would be to repeal Section 2 of the Facilities Act and to extend those provisions of Part YII of the Local Government Act, 1933, which lay down a Compulsory Purchase Order procedure,  to all cases in which by
virtue of any public general Act, whether existing or future, a local authority may be authorised to purchase land compulsorily. The effect of this would be in general to supersede the Provisional Order procedure so far as regards county councils, and borough and urban and rural district councils where acting under powers conferred by public general Acts;    but it would be necessary to retain the Provisional Order procedure for certain exceptional cases,  e.g., land belonging to statutory undertakers which are specifically exempted from the Compulsory Purchase Order procedure by the Local Government Act, 1933.      I should not propose to extend the Compulsory Purchase Order procedure to cases where the power ox compulsory purchase is conferred by a local Act.      It is true that these cases are covered by Section 2 of the Facilities Act, but in practice Compulsory Purchase Orders based on local Act powers have not been made.10.     I have reason to think that local authorities in general would welcome the Bill.     As regards the landowning interests,  the position may be more difficult, but the fact that Section 2 of the Public lYorks Facilities Act, 1930, has been extended from year to year without serious protest and that since 1930 Parliament has adopted the Compulsory Purchase Order procedure in preference to the Provisional Order procedure in a number of important Acts,  including the Air Navigation Act, 1936,  the Restriction of Ribbon Development Act, 1935,  the Physical Training and Recreation Act, 1937, and the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1937,  suggests that the simpler procedure is generally regarded as acceptable.On the other hand, it is the case that the proposals for extending the Compulsory Purchase Order procedure in the &apos; London County Council  (General Powers) Bill which will be shortly before Parliament have provoked protests from a number
of the City Companies.     To some extent these protests seemto be based on a misconception both of the existing law andof what is intended.     But in one instance a private report made to the Haberdashers Company by their solicitors disclosesfrankly enough the ground of objection.      The report concludesas follows:-&quot;It is impossible to pretend that this piece of legislation, if it should pass into law, would not affect owners of land at least in the Administrative County of London.     At present there is every reason for the County Council and the Metropolitan Borough Councils to confine the acquisition of land for the majority of their purposes to the private purchase of property from willing sellers,  even if the property in question is not the one best suited for their purpose. The expense of promoting the special legislation which up to the present has been necessary to enable property to be acquired compulsorily for any other than certain specified purposes has in itself provided an adequate safeguard for the general body of property owners. If this automatic safeguard is now to be removed an increase of bureaucratic control is almost inevitable.11,     There is an alternative if a Bill on these lineswere regarded as too controversial or were for other reasonsinadvisable.     It would be possible so far as my department is concerned to draft the Bill in terms of repealing Section 2of the Facilities Act and extending the Compulsory PurchaseOrder procedure to the five purposes mentioned in paragraph 7of this paper, viz., public health, town halls and municipaloffices, mental hospitals etc., mental deficiency institutions and poor law.     The first of these purposes (public health)would cover roads and parking places and I understand that ifthese are included, a Bill of this character would meetthe wishes of the Minister of Transport.     As regards thethree last-mentioned purposes, it will be seen from thefigures given in paragraph 7 that little use of theFacilities Act has actually been made in connection with these purposes.     But, none the less, if the simpler and moreexpeditious procedure of Compulsory Purchase Order were
o h) Jallowed to expire as regards these purposes, I think it probable that the county and count?/ borough councils would raise a vigorous protest and would argue that the loss of these powers would go some way to nullify the effect of the five-year programmes which the Government will be simultaneously urging them to adopt.12.     The Act of 1930 applies to Scotland as well as to England and Wales and I understand that, while relatively few cases have arisen under the Act in Scotland,  the Secretary of State for Scotland considers that it is desirable that the course suggested in this Memorandum should be made applicable to Scotland subject to any necessary adjustments of the details and drafting.K.W.Ministry of- Health.
