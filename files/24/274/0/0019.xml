INTRODUCTION.1.   The Committee were appointed on the 26th April last &quot; To consider and examine the various processes for the production of oil from coal and certain other materials indigenous to this country, and to report on their economic possibilities, and on the advantages to be obtained by way of security of oil supplies in emergency.&apos;32. In order that the Committee might discharge their terms of reference, they have found it necessary to cover a wide field of investigation, involving, besides an enquiry into the various processes for obtaining oil from coal, shale, &amp;c, the consideration of the needs of this country for oil supplies, in peace time and in emergency, together with the means which are or can be employed to meet those needs.3. The Committee have heard the evidence of a number of witnesses of very varied experience and opinions. They have examined representatives of those Government departments which are concerned with the general questions of supply of oil for civil and industrial needs, with meeting the requirements of the Service departments, and with scientific research.4. On the production and supply side, the Committee have had the oppor-tunity of hearing the views of prominent members of the Oil, Coal, Gas, Shale Oil, Coke Oven and Low Temperature Carbonisation industries. The Committee were able to visit the coal-petrol Hydrogenation plant of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., at Billingham, and have, discussed the hydrogenation process with various representatives of the Company both at the works and in London.5. Accompanied by their technical advisers, the management of certain important commercial concerns, who have been considering the possible develop-ment in this country of the Fischer, or similar processes, have given evidence and have furnished the Committee with much valuable information and data.6. All the witnesses, without exception, have been most helpful, and even generous, in&apos;placing at the disposal of the Committee all the information it was in their power to give, and the Committee desire to place on record their deep appreciation of the services and the most valuable assistance they rendered.7. The Committee desire to call special attention to the fact that some of the information supplied to them, much of which is included in this Report, was of a highly confidential nature, and was furnished on the understanding that it would not be made public.8. All relevant information available in the Mines Department, the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research (including the Fuel Research Station), and in the offices of the Committee of Imperial Defence connected with the work of other committees, has been placed at the disposal of the Committee, and, as a result, the Committee&apos;s investigations have been much facilitated.9. The Committee visited the Fuel Research Station at Greenwich and saw the work which is being carried out there in connection with the Hydrogenation (Bergius) process and the production of oil by the synthesis of gases (Fischer and Robinson Bindley processes).10. The Committee gave careful consideration to the question how they ought to interpret the phrase &quot; the various processes &quot; in their terms of reference. They decided that it was hot practicable for them to investigate every variation of a main process brought to their notice. The variations, particularly in the case of the low temperature carbonisation process, differ from one another only on technical points which have no material effect on the quantities of the oil products obtained. Nor did the Committee consider that they could investigate the claims put forward in respect of a number of processes which have not been developed beyond the laboratory stage.
11. Commenting to the Committee on this question, Sir Frank Smith, Secretary to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, remarked as follows:  &quot; It is desirable to be quite clear that the yields and ease of working of any process involving heat treatment of coal cannot be proved by experiments on a laboratory scale. The rate at which the coal is heated, and the rate at which the volatile products are removed, have a considerable effect on the products obtained. These rates are necessarily affected by the bulk of the coal being treated, i.e., by the size of the plant.&quot;12. It is clearly not practicable, therefore, to determine the economic possi-bilities of processes which are only in an early stage of development. The Committee are satisfied that in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, arrangements already exist under which, in promising cases, technical help and even a measure of financial assistance can be given to enable a new process to be tried out, provided that the issue is of sufficient national importance. Having examined several cases in which the Government departments concerned have been criticised for not giving such assistance on the basis of claims made by inventors and owners of processes, and the Committee are satisfied that there is no justification for these criticisms. There is no doubt in their minds that a very sympathetic attitude is shown in the consideration of these new developments.13. The Committee have dealt with this matter at this early stage of their Report because it arises out of the consideration of their terms of reference, and it enables them to explain what their procedure has been and their reasons for adopting it.14. Having thus reviewed the matter, the Committee decided to regard the phrase &quot; the various processes&quot; as meaning the several broad categories of processes available for obtaining oil from materials indigenous to this country, such as those concerned with (1) the production of oil from shale, (2) the produc-tion of benzole and tar and tar products.at gas works and coke ovens, (3) low temperature carbonisation, and (4) hydrogenation and synthetic processes. Each of these categories has been carefully reviewed by the Committee.15. The importance of oil in the national economy of all the leading countries is very great. World production of crude petroleum has increased during this century from about 20 million tons in 1900 to 245 million tons in 1936, or practically twelve-fold. Consumption is still steadily growing and this country is the third largest consumer, coming next to the two largest oil producing countries, viz., the United States of America and Russia.16. It can be no matter of surprise, therefore, that, as the Secretary for Mines remarked in the House of Commons when announcing the appointment of the Committee, &quot; the possibility of obtaining substantial supplies of oil from coal has excited much public interest.&quot;17.. If this much desired result could be obtained with any reasonable degree of economy many advantages of great national importance would arise. But it is not possible to obtain a correct picture of the contribution which oil produced from materials indigenous to this country can make, whether under the two entirely different conditions of peace or war, without taking into account certain severely practical considerations, the chief of which have been examined by the Committee and are dealt with in the subsequent Sections of the Report.18. Part of the public interest referred to is no doubt due to the knowledge that big developments are taking place elsewhere in the production of oil from solid materials. Germany has embarked on a general policy of self-sufficiency, and part of that policy consists in a great programme for the building of plants to manufacture oil from coal. The policy of Germany in this respect is one of much interest, but it does not appear to the Committee that, because Germany has thought fit to undertake her great programme, this country should necessarily follow that policy. The economic and natural factors of oil supply in this country and in Germany are different both in peace time and war, and there are several technical conditions, such as the existence of extensive deposits of German brown coal, &amp;c, which are not similar to those found in Great Britain. But there is no doubt the German experience in certain respects can be of assistance to this
country, and the Committee have carefully considered technical data submitted to them by witnesses, as a result of the facilities granted to them to visit plants in Germany.19. Oil from coal plants are being established in certain other countries, but on a much smaller scale.20. An immense amount of thought and scientific activity is being expended in this country and elsewhere on the subject, and no one can doubt the importance of following the technical developments which are taking place. It is interesting to recall that the last Royal Commission on the Coal Industry, which reported hardly more than ten years ago, could say very little of a definite character about the hydrogenation process, so recent are these developments. The process as applied to the treatment of coal and coal tar oils has now been technically proved, and it is used in the petroleum industry for the commercial treatment of certain crude oils and the manufacture of special products.21. In preparing their Report the Committee have assumed that it will be more convenient if they deal as concisely as possible, in the main part of the Report, with the principal points which have emerged from their investigations, and embody in Appendices the statistical a,nd other data on which their conclusions have been based.22.   The Report is divided into the following Sections : Section I. The position in regard to natural oil supplies.Section II. The production of oil from home sources.Section III. The economic aspect of the home production of oil.Section IV. The position in time of war (a) Imported oil.(5) Home production.Section   V. Conclusions and Recommendations. Appendices..Section I.THE POSITION IN REGARD TO NATURAL OIL SUPPLIES.23. The proved supplies of petroleum, which are for all practical purposes the only source of supply of oil fuels and lubricating oils, are very unevenly distributed geographically. During recent years just over 80 per cent, of the world&apos;s production has been obtained in three countries, U.S.A. with 60 per cent., Russia with about 11 per cent, and Venezuela with about 9 per cent. There are only seven countries with a production in excess of 5 million tons per annum, and out of a total world production of 245 million tons in 1936, these seven countries accounted for 226 million tons. A Table showing world production of crude oil is given in Appendix I, Table 1.24. All the important nations of the world, except the U.S.A. and Russia, are dependent mainly on imported supplies to meet their needs for petroleum pi&apos;oducts.25. While, however, this country finds itself in virtually the same position as France, Germany, Italy and Japan in this respect, it has certain definite advantages not possessed by the others. For many years British oil companies have taken a large share in the development of the oil industry of the world, as a result of which they have acquired concessions over large sources of production, own considerable refinery capacity and a very large tanker fleet, and have distributing organisations all over the world. This is a matter of considerable importance when comparing the relative position of this country in the matter of oil supplies with that of the other leading nations, or when considering whether exceptional measures should be taken to encourage the production of oil from materials indigenous to this country.26. The crude petroleums from the various oilfields of the world are not a uniform substance, but present marked differences in characteristics. Some crudes on distillation furnish small quantities of light products and a large proportion
of heavy or fuel oils. Some are not suitable for the production of lubricating oils, and others produce little or no spirit suitable for aviation purposes. It is the business of the oil industry, by the adoption of various methods of refining and blending, to produce that balance of products or &quot; fractions &quot; which is necessary to meet the demands of the market. Quantitatively, the two most important products are motor spirit and fuel oil. Besides these products there are kerosene, gas oil and light diesel oil, lubricating oil and diesel oil of a heavier character.27. In those countries like Great Britain where road transport is highly developed, motor spirit is the most important product from the point of view of quantity and, excepting aviation spirit and high grade lubricating oils, also from the point of view of price.28. With the development of compression-ignition engines for use in motor transport, the importance of gas oil and light diesel oil is growing, although it seems unlikely that for many years it can reach the position which motor spirit now occupies. As against a consumption in 1936 of over 1,300 million gallons of motor spirit in this country, the consumption of road diesel oil was about 44 million gallons.29. Kerosene, which in some countries, such as Russia, India and China, is still very important, is not used in this country in anything like the same proportion as was formerly the case, although the quantities are substantial. &apos;30. Lubricating oils are of vital importance to any industrial country. About half a million tons per annum are used in Great Britain.31. Of the various petroleum products used in this country,&apos; fuel oil is the cheapest and most readily obtainable.32. Particulars of the oil imports into this country, classified according to products, for a series of years are given in Appendix I, Table 2.33. Improvements are continually being effected in the methods of treating and refining petroleum. This is particulaily the case with motor spirit, due to the development of motor-car engines with high compression ratios, which has led to a demand for motor fuels with good anti-detonating properties or good &quot;octane&quot; fuels, the anti-knock properties being measured by an &quot;Octane number. &quot;*34. It is possible to improve the anti-knock qualities of a given spirit by the addition of considerable proportions of such fuels as benzole or alcohol, or of small quantities of such &apos;&apos; anti-knocks &apos;&apos; as tetraethyl lead. The latter when mixed in small quantities with the spirit has a marked effect. For various reasons of a technical nature, the improvement effected by this &quot; anti-knock &quot; cannot be extended indefinitely, and only a small proportion of tetraethyl lead can be used effectively.35. The development of the diesel or compression-ignition engine for motor transport has also led to the demand for a high quality light diesel oil for use in such engines. In these engines fuels with good &quot; cetene numbers &quot;* are required, with the opposite combustion characteristics to motor spirit.36. The Committee wish to draw attention to these many points, because they are of moment when the possibilities of making substantial quantities of oil products from coal and other materials indigenous to this country come under consideration.* The octane number of a petrol is defined as the percentage of iso-octane by volume in a blend with normal heptane, the blend having the same knocking tendency as the petrol under specified conditions of test in a standard single cylinder engine. Thus, if the petrol is matched by a blend of 70 per cent, iso-octane and 30 per cent, heptane, its octane number is 70. Iso-octane and normal heptane are pure hydrocarbons and possess constant properties, iso-octane having a high and heptane a low resistance to knocking. By definition, the octane number of iso-octane is 100 and that of heptane is 0.In the case of diesel fuels ignition quality is expressed in terms of the percentage of cetene in a blend with alpha-methyl naphthalene having the same ignition delay angle as the test fuel in a compression-ignition engine under specified test conditions.
37. There, is one other modern development of importance which should be mentioned, viz., the provision of special fuels suitable for aviation purposes. The Committee refer to this in Section IV, which deals with the position in war time, as the demand for aviation fuels in peace time presents no serious problem.38. The Committee have already made a reference to the increasing consumption of oil in all important countries. In the case of Great Britain there has been an increase in imports between 1920 and 1936 of over 230 per cent. Between 1920 and 1925 the increase was 83 per cent.; between 1925 and 1930, 49 per cent.; and between 1930 and 1936, 22 per cent. Details of the total imports for certain years from 1920 to 1936 and of the percentage of the requirements supplied by particular countries are given in Appendix I, Table 3.39. As regards the c.i.f. value p&quot;er gallon of oil imports into this country, the changes in recent years have been within quite small limits. Oil is included in that comparatively small list of commodities the prices of which are at present lower than the pre-war level. Particulars of the c.i.f. values for a series of years are given in Appendix I, Table 4.40. The Committee have addressed themselves to the question whether there is any likelihood of the demand outstripping the supply in the near future, to such an extent as to bring about a substantial rise in prices. This question has a very important bearing on the production of oil from sources indigenous to this country, as processes which at current prices may be quite uneconomic, might, if there were a substantial rise in world prices, become paying propositions.41. The possibility of such a rise in world prices has been brought forward by certain witnesses when advocating various processes. The Committee have obtained opinions from a number of responsible quarters, and the general view seems to be that there is little likelihood of a substantial advance in the near future.42. A leading British oil industrialist told the Committee that there has never been a time in the history of the industry when it was possible to produce so greatly in excess of immediate demands.43. It would appear to the Committee useless for any industry, which is developed for the production of oil from coal, to build on the hope that the substantial gap which may exist between the cost of petroleum oil products, and those of home-produced oils, will be bridged by a rise in world prices within a few years&apos; time.44. Nevertheless, the situation may change, and if this should happen within a period of even ten or fifteen years from now, it must be recognised that a considerable number of years would be required in which to establish a new industry on the scale necessary to meet the needs of this country.Section II.PRODUCTION OF OIL FROM HOME SOURCES.45. There are six or seven possible methods of producing oil products in this country, and the Committee think it will be convenient if these are classified in three categories : A. Natural petroleum and shale oil. B. The coal carbonisation industries : (i) gas industry, (ii) coke oven industry, (iii) low temperature carbonisation.C. Hydrogenation; Fischer and similar synthetic processes.46. The Committee will deal with the salient points of each in this Section, and include in Appendices such additional information as they consider necessary to amplify particulars of the newer processes.
47. The Committee have placed the shale oil industry in Category A because it is practicable to produce from crude Scottish shale oil a full range of products similar to those obtained from natural petroleum. It was, in fact, the early work carried out on shale oil in this country which greatly assisted the early commercial development of the petroleum industry.A.-(i) Natural Petroleum.48. It has been for some years the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage the search for natural petroleum in this country, but so far the quantities discovered have been negligible.49. The search was started during the latter part of the Great War, when the work was carried out by Messrs. S. Pearson and Sons, Ltd., acting on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and about  560,000 was spent on the effort. Eleven boreholes were put down, mainly in the Midlands, but, except for one small producer in Derbyshire, from which a small output of good quality petroleum is still obtained, the work failed to show the existence of supplies of oil of any magnitude.50. A few years ago renewed interest was shown, and it was represented to the Government that one of the big obstacles to serious work was the unsuitability of existing legislation. Accordingly, a new Petroleum (Production) Bill was introduced to Parliament in the Spring of 1934. This Bill became law in July 1934, and Regulations made under it were issued in 1935. Under the Act the property in any oil which may exist in this country is vested in the Crown.51. Several deep boreholes have already been drilled, one having reached over 6,500 feet and another 5,100 feet. Four boreholes have been abandoned as unsuccessful, but others are being drilled.52. As the efforts made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the. period 1918-22 indicate, the work of searching and drilling for oil is a costly one, but with companies of the standing of those now interested in the search, there has been no difficulty in private enterprise finding the necessary capital. All the licences contain a schedule of working obligations, and the work is being-carried on as expeditiously as circumstances will permit.53. The Committee have taken note of the renewed activity which is being displayed in this direction, and, while it is possible that increased supplies may be found, they do not consider the position is as yet sufficiently clear to warrant them taking such a possibility into account as a factor affecting their conclusions.A.-(ii) Shale Oil.54. The Scottish shale oil industry was started in about 1850, and was for many years the sole indigenous source of oils similar to petroleum products.55. After a steady expansion over a number of years, the industry reached its maximum output of 3^ million tons of shale in 1913. It might have been assumed that this industry would have considerably expanded its operations during the war, but, on the contrary, owing to the withdrawal of men for the Forces, and consequent shortage of labour, the output of shale fell nearly 10 per cent, by 1915. Special efforts made to improve matters led to some increase being effected in 1916 and 1917, but in 1918 the output again fell slightly.56. During the post-war period low prices for the whole range of products caused successive reductions in the scale of operations and the industry was finally brought to a very critical condition. The situation was improved to some extent in 1928, when under the Finance Act of that year a Customs duty of 4*2. a gallon was levied on imported motor spirit, with exemption for spirit produced at home from indigenous materials. The inducement was not sufficient, however, to prevent further restriction of shale output, which fell from its 1928 level of 2,038,000 tons to 1,733,000 tons in 1931 and to 1,400,000 tons (its present levett in 1932.[16154] c
57. Encouraged, however, by the provisions of the 1928 Finance Act, the shale oil industry at once adopted measures to increase the production of motor spirit by cracking some of its heavier products, thereby obtaining a larger yield of spirit. The duty was increased to Qd. per gallon in April 1931, and to Sd. a few months later, the preference on home-produced spirit being correspondingly increased.58. Unfortunately, the industry was again soon in trouble as the steady improvement in the design of the petrol engine resulted in the demand for a spirit of higher anti-knock value than the industry could produce without increased blending.59. Further relief came, however, in 1935, when the duty on imported oils for use in diesel-engined road vehicles was raised from Id. to 8d. per gallon, exemption being again granted for home-produced oil.60. This enabled the industry to turn its attention to the production of light diesel oil, for which it is particularly suited, and in 1936, 41 per cent, of the whole production of the industry represented oil of this character.61. In 1936, 1,407,000 tons of shale were produced, and the average yield per ton was about 22 gallons of crude oil. In addition, 38 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia per ton were obtained. The total yield of liquid products amounted to 78,900 tons, or about 21 million gallons. The quantities of the several products were : Motor Spirit and Naphtha    ............ 23,900Light Shale Oil (Admiralty)............ 2,550Diesel Oil (for road vehicles^............ 48,000Gas Oil.........      ............ 1,950Fuel Oil............-......... 2,50078,900In addition, 8,000 tons of paraffin wax and 2,400 tons of coke were produced.62. The Committee were informed that it was not practicable to give the actual manufacturing cost of any individual product. The all-in cost (mid-1937) for all marketable products per gallon of crude oil, excluding any allowance for depreciation, was given as Q-7d. per gallon, made up of 5-Ad. for mining and crude oil production costs, and l-3d. for cost of crude oil refining. The total return per gallon of crude oil, including the value of all preferences, was at the same date 8^d. per gallon. There was, therefore, a gross working profit per gallon of crude oil (before providing for depreciation) of about l\d. per gallon. From information given to the Committee, it would appear that a reasonable charge for depreciation would be in the neighbourhood of Id. per gallon of crude oil. This would leave a net profit of \d. per gallon, representing a yield of about 6 per cent, on the value of the capital employed.- 63. The Committee were assured that the most modern methods of operation are being used, and they are satisfied that the industry is being efficiently run. The Committee were given the opportunity of examining the detailed statements of account of the operating companies and of Scottish Oils, Ltd., and they are satisfied that, even with the present substantial assistance which is afforded by the preference on home-produced oils, the profit is a very moderate one in relation to the value of the capital employed in the enterprise. The value of this preference last year to the Shale Companies was no less than  660,000, a figure in excess of the Companies&apos; total wages bill. To put the point in another way, the effect of the withdrawal of the preference would be to turn a modest rate of profit on capital into a heavy loss.64. At the peak period the industry found employment for some 10,000 men. To-day, including those employed at a colliery which supplies coal to the industry, and at two small ancillary works, occupation is found for 4,268 men and boys, who, in order that as many as possible may be given employment, work on a spread-over system of three weeks on and one week off.
65. The case of this industry is an interesting one, and the Committee give in Appendix II a fuller note of its history. It has existed for a long period of years and at times has enjoyed considerable prosperity. But in spite of the improve-ments in organisation, concentration on the most efficient units, and the large measure of assistance afforded by the preference referred to above, amounting to more than the whole of the wages cost, it finds the competition of natural oil products difficult to withstand.66. Those responsible for the industry have stated that, if the preference is maintained, it will probably in time again be able to increase considerably its production. If, on the other hand, the preference were withdrawn, or materially reduced, it appears that the industry would once more be in a very parlous condition.67. The Committee consider that the industry is worthy of every encourage-ment. Its raw material cannot be put to any other use and there is no competition between its products and those of other existing home industries. Its production of diesel oil would be of assistance in meeting the demand for fuel for heavy road transport, which is bound to be of great importance in time of emergency. In addition, although the motor spirit produced is not of high octane value, and hence cannot be used for aviation purposes, it is suitable for motor transport.68. There are other considerable resources of shale in various parts of the country, but the possibility of the extension of the industry to utilise these is dependent upon the development of a process for the economical removal of sulphur, which is often associated with these shales.B. and C. : Processes for obtaining Oil from Coal.69. The other possible sources of home-produced oil are those which arise from the treatment of coal, which is the most important raw material indigenous to this country.70. Coal, as is well known, is chemically a very complicated substance. Its chief constituent is carbon, but other elements are combined with the carbon, notably hydrogen and oxygen.71. Oil, on the other hand, is essentially a mixture of hydrocarbons, the result of chemical combination of carbon and hydrogen.72. The principle which underlies all processes for the production of liquid hydrocarbons from coal consists in increasing the ratio of hydrogen to carbon. Bituminous coal contains 4-5 per cent, to 5-5 per cent, by weight of hydrogen, and petroleum oil contains about 13 per cent., while the carbon content may be about the same in both cases.73. The desired increase in hydrogen ratio can be effected either by making the coal react direct with hydrogen, or by carbonising it, and decomposing it to yield volatile fractions (gas, spirit, tar), which contain a greater percentage of hydrogen than the original coal, leaving a residue, coke, which contains less.74. The amount of hydrogen present in the coal, therefore, sets a theoretical maximum to the yield of oil that can be obtained by carbonisation. For several reasons, however, this maximum can never be reached. Some of the hydrogen is given off as gas, some combines with the oxygen present to form water, and some is left in the coke. Hence the amount of oil that can be produced, even under the best conditions, is necessarily small, and this applies to all carbonisation processes.75. On the other hand, the hydrogenation and synthetic processes both supply, although by different means, additional hydrogen, and so convert a great proportion of the carbon present in the coal into oil. This results in a substantially greater yield of oil products.[16154] c 2
B. The Carbonisation Industries.(i) and (ii) Gas and Coke Oven Industries.76. It is convenient to deal with these two industries together, partly because, from the point of view of the Committee&apos;s investigations, the same kind of considerations arise in both cases, and partly because it is not possible to separate for each industry the statistical information in regard to the production of oil products.77. Both industries carbonise the coal they use at high temperatures; both obtain gas, coke and tar as products. But the gas industry being primarily concerned with the supply of gas for purposes of light, heat and power, aims at the largest practicable yield of gas;, while the coke oven industry, primarily concerned with the supply of metallurgical coke to the iron and steel industry, endeavours to secure as large a yield of coke as is feasible, although the sale of surplus gas to the gas industry is becoming of some importance.78. In the case of the gas industry, the coke and tar therefore are by-products, and in the case of the coke oven industry, the gas and tar fall into that category.79. The gas in both industries is &quot; scrubbed &quot; for the recovery of benzole, further small quantities of which are also obtained from the tar; and the tar, on distillation, also produces a substantial quantity of creosote, with other products, such as phenol and naphthalene, and a large residuum of pitch.80. It is the benzole and the creosote which mainly concern the Committee&apos;s investigations.81. Benzole, when refined, is of considerable importance for use as a motor fuel, being usually sold mixed with petrol in the proportion of 25-30 per cent, of benzole to 70-75 per cent, of petrol.   It possesses good anti-knock properties.82. But crude benzole also provides the principal source in this country of toluol, which in times of national emergency is required in large quantities for the manufacture of high explosives.83. Phenol is also used to some extent in the making of explosives, but is now of more importance as a raw material in the plastics industry, and for the preparation of dyes and drugs.84. Creosote finds uses in a number of industries. During the past three years substantial quantities of it have been treated at Billingham by the hydro-hydrogenation process for the production of motor spirit.85. From the foregoing it follows that the capacity of the gas and the coke oven industries to provide supplies of oil products is governed by the demand for their principal products.86. Benzole. On the basis of the tonnage of coal carbonised 98 per cent, of the coke ovens scrub their gas for benzole, and the average yield of crude benzole during recent years has been just over 3 gallons per ton of coal carbonised. The yield depends mainly on the kind of coal, and particular method of carbonisation used; it may vary from 2 to 2\ gallons in some districts to as much as 4 to 5 gallons in others where high volatile coals are available. On the present basis it is doubtful if a much larger production of benzole can be expected from the coke oven industry, although, as modern installations replace old, and technique develops, some improvement will take place.87. In the case of the gas industry,&apos; there has been during the past few years a steady increase in the production of benzole. In 1936, however, on the basis of the tonnage of coal carbonised, only 47 per cent, of the gas works recovered benzole, while the average yield was 2^ gallons of crude benzole per ton of coal carbonised, as compared with just over-3 gallons at coke ovens. In practice, therefore, the maximum yield of oil products is not made available in normal times.88. The difference in yields at coke ovens and gas works is to be accounted for mainly by the fact that benzole has a good heat value, and as gas works have a statutory obligation to supply their gas on a thermal basis, it is necessary to replace the heat value of benzole if this is extracted.   Large gas companies do
this generally by making a water gas from coke which is enriched by oil the so-called carburetted water-gas process. In the case of smaller undertakings, the expense of putting in benzole recovery plant and carburetted water-gas plant is a more serious matter, and the recovery of benzole is not regarded as an economic proposition. These considerations do not apply in the case of coke ovens, except those which supply gas to gas undertakings.89. One of the developments of the future as regards the gas industry may be the greater use of processes for the total gasification of coal. In that case the yield of tar per ton of coal gasified might be decreased, but it could not for many years have its influence on the total quantity of tar available.90. The following statement gives particulars of the production of crude benzole during the past three years and the output of refined products therefrom. These particulars were obtained from official statistics collected under the pro-visions of the British Hydrocarbon Oils Production Act, 1934 : Total quantity of coal carbonised at gas works and coke ovensCrude benzole produced By gas stripping at gas works By gas stripping at coke ovens By distillation of tar1934. 1935. 1936.Million tons.34-835-539-1Thousand gallons. 13,590      17,260      20,160 48,130      51,570      58,910 3,400        3,500        3,900Total65,120      72,330      82,970Refined products Motor spirit...	39,270	44,573	51,19090&apos;s benzole ...	2,165	1,957	2,17990&apos;s toluol   .........	1,133	1,523	1,663Pure benzole...	2,292	2,210	2,652Pure toluol ...	1,330	1,550	1,743Xylol, naphthas, &amp;c.	3,164	5,257	5,290Total   ......	49,354	57,070	64,71791. Whilst production in 1936, of 51 million gallons of motor fuel was a helpful contribution to the needs of this country, it represented only 4 per cent, of the total requirements. As the information given above indicates, there is a further potential supply available which, if it were possible for all gas works to scrub their gas for benzole, and to be brought up to the present standard of recovery obtaining at coke ovens, would represent a further quantity of about 35 million gallons of crude benzole, producing 20 million gallons of motor benzole, in addition to smaller quantities of other refined products. On the basis of the present scale of activity of the two industries, this would represent the practical limit of production.92. The extraction of toluol from benzole on a larger scale than at present, would reduce the quantity of benzole available for use as motor fuel. Further reference is made to this point in Section IV.93. Creosote. The production of creosote by the distillation of tar amounted in 1936, to about 90 million gallons (410,000 tons).94. The proportion of creosote in tar represents generally about 40 per cent., so that it should have been possible, if all tar were distilled, to produce about 3f gallons per ton of coal carbonised, or a total of 146 million gallons per annum
(660,000 tons). At present a large proportion of the tar is not distilled for the production of creosote, but after dehydration and distillation for recovery of the lighter products, including benzole, is used for surfacing roads.95. The following table shows the production by the combined industries and disposal of creosote for the years 1931 to 1937 : Year.	Production.	Exports.*	Home Consumption.							Timber preservation.

Economic Aspect. It has not been possible to obtain all the information which would be needed to enable the Committee to estimate the precise contribution which these different by-products make in the economics of the gas and coke oven industries. In the case of gas works, reference has been made to the heat value of the benzole. The Committee were informed that, while large gas works might be able to make the necessary arrangements to recover benzole at a cost of 4(2. a gallon, which is the amount of the guaranteed preference under the British Hydrocarbon Oils Production Act, smaller undertakings could not make it pay at 8d. a gallon, which is the amount of the actual preference at present enjoyed. There is no doubt, however, that the existence of the preference, and especially the guarantee of a preference over a period of years, has led to an increase in the recovery of benzole in both industries.97. The market prices of tar, creosote and pitch have fluctuated widely in recent years. A few years ago creosote was difficult to dispose of at more than a nominal figure, while at present the price of pitch is about 33s. per ton at works, compared with nearly  5 per ton four or five years ago. The guaranteed preference on home-produced motor spirit has, however, opened up a new and substantial market for creosote for treatment by hydrogenation and this has led to a great improvement in its market value for all purposes.98. The assistance thus given by the preferences on home-produced oils has, therefore, been of material help to these two important industries and has-resulted in an increase in the production of oil fuels.(iii) Low Temperature Carbonisation.99. In many ways the low temperature carbonisation industry is closely allied to the gas and coke oven industries, although the coal, as the name of the process suggests, is carbonised at considerably lower temperatures, generally within the range 550DC. to 7000C.100. The main product of the low temperature carbonisation process is a semi-coke which is suitable, for.burning in domestic grates, and its other yields, are by-products.101.   The methods used fall roughly into two main divisions : -(a) Those which carbonise coal alone.(b) Those which carbonise a mixture of coal and oil.The majority of plants in operation belong to Class (a).
102. With regard to Class (&amp;) the yield of oil per ton of mixture processed is, as might be expected, greater than if coal alone were used. When, however, the quantity of oil used in the mixture is taken into account, the recovery of tar oil from the coal alone shows very little, if any, improvement. Although some technical advantages may be claimed, in practice no great improvement is associated with this method. In the view of the Committee, there is, therefore, little advantage to be derived from the use of this method as opposed to the carbonisation of coal alone. In addition, the fact that oil is required in tlhe original mixture would make this method one of very doubtful value in time of war if petroleum oil were used. Claims have been made, however, that coal oils could be used, but we are satisfied that supplies in sufficient quantity are not available for these purposes to enable large-scale development to take place.103. The low temperature carbonisation process for treating coal has obtained much publicity in recent years. Numerous companies have been floated to exploit various inventions. Unfortunately, the great majority of these ventures have been based on claims that were subsequently proved to be too sanguine. Difficulties which were not apparent when the coal was treated only on a laboratory scale have appeared when full-sized plants were worked, and as allowances for those had not been made in estimating results, much money has been lost. Some further particulars in regard to low temperature carbonisation are given in Appendix III.Official Tests of Low Temperature Carbonisation Plants.104. The Committee desire to call attention to the fact that, in order t6 assist in obtaining the fullest possible data in connection with these processes, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research is authorised to report free of charge on the technical aspects of any low temperature carbonisation process, provided it has reached a semi-commercial scale of development. A number of processes have already been examined in this way.105. Some complaints have been made that these tests are limited to an examination of the technical aspects of the carbonisation process only, and that it would be well if they were extended to give more attention to all technical claims made, and even to cover the economic aspects.106. The Committee feel that these reports could be made of more value if they dealt with all technical points connected with the operation of, and the products of the process, and not merely with the carbonisation side, but they do not consider that it is desirable that they should extend beyond purely technical matters. The economic aspects involve many other considerations which are outside the purview of a technical investigation.Different methods of operating process.107. As one might expect in the case of a new development of this kind there is on record a very large number of different methods of operating the low temperature carbonisation process a figure of 150 has been given to the Committee by the Mines Department. Many of these have not advanced beyond the laboratory stage and a number, on being tried out in semi-commercial or even commercial scale plants, have failed.Extent of development.108. In 1936, official records show that there were 15 plants operating &quot; on a commercial or semi-commercial scale for the production and sale of products &apos;&apos;; these represented eleven different processes.
109. The following table shows the quantities of coal treated at low temperature carbonisation plants, and the total and average yield of products, for the years 1933-36 :-	Unit.	1933.	1934.	1935.	1936.

These figures are related only to the plants where crude spirit was extracted from the gas produced.110. Of the total quantity of coal treated, by far the greater proportion was used by one process, that operated by the Low Temperature Carbonisation Co.,. Ltd.Products of Low Temperature Carbonisation.111. Coke. Low temperature coke provides a good fuel with valuable smokeless and radiating properties particularly suitable for domestic purposes, and on this account many people advocate a wide extension of the use of fuel of this class, in order to improve the atmospheric conditions of the large towns.112. Motor Spirit. Refined motor spirit is produced by low temperature carbonisation in a ratio of 2 to 3 gallons per ton of coal. (A further 1J gallons can be obtained from the tar.) The spirit thus produced has been used by the Royal Air Force as an aviation spirit, but of the two specifications at present in use it unfortunately only just meets the lower one, covering a fuel of 77 octane number. This specification will soon be superseded, and as the low temperature spirit is not very susceptible to improvement by the addition of tetraethyl lead it is not likely, without special treatment, to be able to meet the specifications for aviation spirit which will be in force in the future.113. Tar. The yield of tar may be as high as 18 to 20 gallons per ton of coal treated. From this tar, as has been mentioned above, 1\ gallons of motor spirit can be obtained by distillation. The remainder of the tar may be utilised in three ways : (1) It may be consumed as a heavy boiler fuel.(2) It may be distilled until pitch is yielded. By this method 10J gallons of light fuel oil, and 80 lbs. of pitch, are obtained. The light fuel oil so produced is not by itself suitable for diesel oil, but can be made so by adding pro-knock compounds. Light tar produced-by low temperature carbonisation contains a higher proportion of tar acids than tar produced by high temperature processes, and there is a gradually widening market for this class of product.(3) It may be treated by hydrogenation, and will then produce from 14 to-15 gallons of motor spirit.
Yields of oil products.114. As already pointed out the oil produced is a by-product; and while there is some variation in the yields of liquid products obtained from different processes, the evidence received has led the Committee to the conclusion that the extent of the variations does not represent more than a few gallons per ton. Accordingly, there is no single process which the Committee could advise should have special consideration on account of the quantity of oil products obtained.115. The Committee took evidence from the Low Temperature Coal Distillers&apos; Association, the President of which is also Chairman of the Low Temperature Carbonisation Co., Ltd. He explained in his evidence that he did not consider the production of oil to be the primary object of low temperature carbonisation; but he suggested that a large-scale development of the industry would result in a substantial contribution being made to the country&apos;s oil requirements.116. The yield of tar in most of the low temperature carbonisation methods which have been tried out on a semi-commercial or commercial scale, is about three-quarters as much again per ton of coal carbonised as that produced at gas works and coke ovens; and it is agreed that it is rather more amenable for the production of oil fuels than high temperature tar. The evidence received indicates, however, that the creosote fraction of high temperature tar, which amounts to about 40 per cent, of that tar, is equally, if not more, suitable than low temperature tar for the hydrogenation process.Possibilities of large-scale development.117. The question then arises : What are the prospects of a really large-scale development of low temperature carbonisation \ and to this point the Committee have given careful consideration.118. From the figures quoted in the Table in paragraph 109 above, it will be seen that the low temperature carbonisation method is first and foremost a coke-producing process, and that in consequence its commercial value is dependent on the possibility of disposing of the coke. This was accepted by the representatives of the Low Temperature Coal Distillers&apos; Association.119. The coke at present produced finds a ready sale, in spite of the fact that the price obtainable per ton is much in excess of that of gas coke, and higher than that of best house coal; while this is an encouraging feature, the evidence laid before the Committee led them to the conclusion that there is at present no assurance that there will be a really large market for such a highly priced fuel. The position might be altered, however, were legislation to be passed within a reasonable period which compelled the use of smokeless fuels for domestic fires, although a measure of this kind might also stimulate the consumption of alternative fuels, and there are indications that low temperature coke is likely to meet in future with increasing competition. Developments are already taking place in regard to the use of high temperature coke in open grates, and steps are also being taken to promote the further use of smokeless coals, and for developing grates which will be able to use bituminous coals with little emission of smoke.120. If these several attempts are successful, then the Committee think that, while low temperature coke may take its place with these other fuels, any idea that it can capture the whole or even a large part of the domestic market is open to question.121. The Committee further examined the claim made by many advocates of low temperature coke that a big development of this process would bring about a much wished for revival in the coal industry.122. The Committee have to report, however, in this connection, that unfortunately the conclusions they arrived at were disappointing. In so far as low temperature coke might be used as a substitute for raw coal, very little increased demand for coal would ensue, as it is calculated that only 10 per cent, more coal would be required to give an equivalent amount of fuel and heat value.123.   Representatives of the coal industry itself were very doubtful if any advantage would be gained by that industry if a large increase in the manufacture [16154] D
of coke by low temperature carbonisation were to take place. These represen-tatives drew the attention of the Committee to the following considerations. The coal which is required for low temperature carbonisation is a cheap grade of small coal, and this, after conversion into coke, would be sold to those householders who had previously bought household coal. At the present time, the household coal side of the coal industry is the most remunerative, and the net result would be the diminution of this trade, and of the total receipts of the industry, as the sales of low temperature coke increased.124 The Committee made a calculation of the results that would ensue if it were possible to secure a large scale development to the extent of treating, say, 10 million tons of coal by low temperature carbonisation. The coke produced would amount to  million tons against a production of 287,000 tons in 1936. As regards oil production about 30 million gallons of motor spirit representing about 2 per cent, of the present consumption might be produced from the gas; and 170 million gallons of heavy oil, of which 60 million gallons might be suitable for use as fuel oil by the Navy, would be obtained. If hydrogenation plants were available (and for their erection a very large capital expenditure would be involved) the heavy oil could be converted into, say, 150 million gallons of motor spirit. Even these quantities of oil would represent a small fraction of the national requirements about 4^ per cent, of the quantities required in the first year of a major war, as shown in Section IV. In any event, the practical difficulties of securing anything approaching this development within any reason-able period are so great that they preclude any serious account being taken of such a possibility. Accordingly, in the view of the Committee, low temperature carbonisation must, in the light of existing information, be ignored as a possible major source of indigenous oil supply.125. To the extent that low temperature carbonisation can develop on normal lines it will, like the other carbonisation industries, make a contribution to the problem of smoke abatement and efficient fuel utilisation, and at the same time will provide some addition to the country&apos;s supplies of home-produced oils.The economics of the process.126. As to the economics of low temperature carbonisation, the following figures of the value of the yields per ton of coal carbonised, using such a process as that of Low Temperature Carbonisation, Ltd., were given to the Committee by the Low Temperature Coal Distillers&apos; Association. It was stated that they would apply to other processes of a similar character using externally heated retorts : 18 gallons of tar: 	s.	d.	s.	d.(5 gallons of pitch at 2d.	1	0		3 gallons of tar acids at 2s.

On the costs side it was difficult to give representative figures, as so much depended on the kind and quality of coal used, size of plant, &amp;c. Coal costs were said to range from 9s. to 14s. a-ton. Retorting costs 2s..; labour costs about 4s. Gd. In addition, there were office expenses, rates and taxes, interest charges, depreciation, &amp;c.
128. On the information available, it is not feasible to determine what would be the margin between costs and receipts. If all the motor spirit and diesel oil, as given in the statement above, that was suitable for the purpose were used as motor fuels (i.e., all the motor spirit and half the diesel oil), the amount of the preference accorded to home-produced oils would represent 6s. out of the total of 18s. received for products other than the semi-coke. One representative of the Association expressed the view, however, that, if the preferences were withdrawn, low temperature carbonisation would still be able to operate at a profit.C. Hydrogenation, Fischer and similar Synthetic Processes.(i) Hydrogenation.129. The hydrogenation process differs fundamentally from the processes in Category B, just described, in that the sole object of this method when treating coal is the production of oil. No important products are obtained which compete with coal, or with its by-products such as gas and coke, and the successful economic development of the process on a large scale would open up an entirely new field for the use of coal. This is a most important factor in the consideration of the relative merits of the various processes. A mixture of coal and tar, or tar only, can also be converted to oil by this process.130. Much information has been supplied to the Committee concerning the work on this process which has been carried out at Billingham during the past ten years by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd/ This, together with some particulars of the earlier history of the process, has been summarised in Appendix No. IV.131. The work at Billingham has covered each stage of development. First, considerable investigation was undertaken in the laboratory. Then extensive work followed in a semi-commercial scale unit, and, finally, for the past two and a half years, there has been the experience of a large commercial scale plant.132. This programme could only have been carried through by an under-taking having great resources, both financial and technical. It is a high testimony to the skill of all concerned that the plant is now virtually in full operation. In 1936, the production was about 120,000 tons of petrol, and the estimated production for 1937, is 130,000 tons, against a designed capacity of 150,000 tons.133. However, in spite of the most thorough investigation at each of the earlier stages in the development, difficulties which were not anticipated have been experienced in the large scale plant, and these have involved the Company in considerable expense and some delay. Some of these difficulties cannot, it appears, be entirely removed except by the reconstruction of plant. With so novel a process it is not surprising that this should be so. But the experience of Billingham suggests very forcibly the necessity of accepting with caution any schemes of this kind involving very large capital expenditure, even if there is available, as in this case, great experience and data based on the most complete preparatory work.134. As will be seen from paragraphs 22 to 24 of the Appendix, the principal difficulty has been in connection with the hydrogenation of coal. It was originally anticipated that the yield of petrol per ton of coal processed would be 64-5 per cent. The actual yield in 1936 was, however, only 46-5 per cent. By carrying out certain modifications, the figure had been raised by June last to 50 per cent.; but the Company do not expect to obtain, in the present plant, a higher yield than 58 per cent.135. The Committee were informed that, in a new plant which embodied all the improvements suggested by the experience gained at Billingham, it would be possible to secure a yield of 61 -3 per cent, from the coal processed (on an ash and moisture-free basis). As the Company had hoped that the original estimate of 64-5 per cent, might in practice be improved upon, this is somewhat disappointing.[16154] &apos; d 2
136. The reduction in yield referred to above has naturally had an important effect on the costs of production, although the financial results have been helped by the treatment of larger quantities of creosote and low temperature tar than were originally contemplated.137. In a new plant treating coal only, the total amount of coal required, including that for the production of hydrogen, power, &amp;c, as well as for processing, is estimated to be 4 -1 tons per ton of petrol made.138. The spirit produced by the plant is of a high grade and during the last few months an octane rating of 75 has been achieved. This is a high standard for a straight or undoped petrol.139. By the addition of tetraethyl lead, within the limits prescribed by the Air Ministry, this spirit can be made to comply with the specification for an 87 octane number aviation fuel. Arrangements have recently been made for bulk quantities of this grade to be supplied to the Royal Air Force. We shall refer to this again in Section IV and also to the production of. an aviation fuel at Billingham which will give a product with an octane number of 95.140. The Committee made enquiries as to the possibilities of obtaining other oil products by the hydrogenation process. The views of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., were as follows : &quot; Diesel Oil.Oils suitable for engines up to 1,000 r.p.m. have already been made without modification of the present process. Such oils are not, except when doped, as suitable for high speed diesel engines, such as are used in road vehicles, as diesel oils made from paraffinic crude oils, but are superior to the aromatic oils derived from carbonisation processes, or made by hydro-hydrogenation with less effective catalysts than those available to companies forming International Hydrogenation Patents, Ltd.Approximately half the output of a hyurogenation plant could be made as diesel oil (the other half being petrol). The yield and cost of diesel oil would be similar to that of petrol.&quot; Fuel Oil.The heavy oil fraction of the crude products from coal is generally suitable as a fuel oil. Care is necessary to obtain the absence of asphaltic solids which have given some trouble in recent samples. About one-third of the output of a coal hydrogenation plant could be obtained as fuel oil, the remainder being petrol or petrol and diesel oil. Owing to the low hydrogen content of the fuel oil, the cost is substantially less than that of petrol, and our calculations have indicated that fuel oil would be profitable if a realisa-tion of very approximately  7 to  8 per ton could be obtained.&quot; Lubricating Oil.Present indications are that lubricating oil cannot be made by the direct hydrogenation of bituminous coal or tars. Possible methods of manufacture are: polymerisation of unsaturated hydrocarbon gases made from the gaseous hydrocarbons which are by-products to the process, and the manufac-ture of synthetic oils from the light oils made by hydrogenation via chlorina-tion and condensation, similar to the methods used in the Fischer process to build up lubricating oils from the crude product. Information on both these possibilities is too scanty to give even indications of yields or cost.&quot;141. At present, therefore, it appears to be clear that the hydrogenation process must be regarded as most suitable for the production of petrol and aviation spirit. v /&apos;--     &apos;,142. As will be seen from the Appendix, the hydrogenation of creosote and low temperature tar, for which only a section of the plant, the so-called vapour phase system, is required, gives very much higher percentage yields than are obtained by the treatment of coal. Supplies of these materials are not, however, available in sufficient quantities in normal times to enable a wider use to be made
of them for this purpose. The possibility of larger supplies becoming available in the event of a national emergency has caused the Committee to give consideration to a scheme for the hydrogenation of creosote oils which is dealt with in Section IV.Coals suitable for hydrogenation.143. The range of coals which are suitable for the process is another important factor in considering the question of hydrogenation. The Committee were informed by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., that the most suitable coals for hydrogenation are boiler slacks, not only because they are cheap, but because the friable coal included the most easily hydrogenable coal.144. It was, therefore, considered desirable in ordinary practice to operate the hydrogenation process in conjunction with collieries working under normal commercial conditions, so that the larger sizes of coal could be sold for household and similar uses, leaving the smaller sizes to be used for the process.145. Tests had been carried out with a large variety of coals from the coal-fields of Durham, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Scotland and South Wales.146. It had been found that all coals of which the carbon content, on an ash and moisture-free basis, was less than 87 per cent., were amenable to hydrogena-tion. In order to obtain a coal for processing of as low an ash content as possible, special cleaning was essential and this operation was stated to cost, in respect of the coal selected for processing, approximately Is. per ton of raw coal bought.147. A special large-scale test .had been darried out on South Wales coals, at the request of the Mines Department, and the Committee were informed that favourable results had been obtained and Imperial Chemicals Industries, Ltd., were satisfied that sufficient supplies were available to meet the requirements of a plant in that area.  Anthracite and steam coals were not suitable.Financial Aspect.148. It will now be convenient to summarize briefly the main financial points concerning hydrogenation, details of which are given in the Appendix.(a) The Existing Billingham Plant.149. Capital Cost. The capital cost of this 150,000-ton plant, including the value of certain plant formerly provided for the making of fertilisers, which was taken over for use in connection with the hydrogenation plant, was just under  7 million.150. Costs of production. The works cost of producing petrol (including works overheads) in 1936, was about lOd. a gallon, and the Company estimate that with improvements since carried out, it may be taken to amount at present to just over 9^d. per gallon.151. There requires to be added to the works cost a charge in respect of depreciation and obsolescence of works and plant. The term &quot; depreciation &quot; is intended to cover the physical wear and tear of the plant, &amp;c, which cannot be made good by maintenance expenditure, or by expenditure on renewals of the component parts of plant as and when they wear out. The charge for &apos;&apos;&apos; obsolescence &apos;&apos; is one which requires to be superimposed upon the charge for depreciation; obsolescence being the loss of value due to the fact that before a plant is physically worn out, it may be uneconomic to work, in view of varying circumstances such as the fact that more up-to-date and efficient plant can be installed in its place. Other causes which, in the present instance, may create obsolescence in the plant are improvements in the quality of the products demanded by the market, and the fact that the commercial prospects of the hydro-hydrogenation process rest on the extent and duration of the preference on home-produced oil.152. It will be appreciated that it is difficult in practice to define where depreciation ends and where obsolescence begins.   But the Company considered
that in view of all the circumstances it would not be unreasonable to charge in respect of depreciation and obsolescence combined, such an annual sum as would write off the whole of the capital expenditure within a period of 10 years as a maximum. Evidence which the Committee have taken from other interests in regard to operations of this character supports this view. The Committee felt it desirable, however, to have an alternative estimate made which ignored the probable factor of obsolescence and had regard to depreciation only. They therefore asked the Company to prepare such a calculation; and this showed an average life, taking the works and plant as a whole, of 20 years. The Company, in furnishing this data, however, made it quite clear that they could not accept such a calculation as giving an adequate charge.153. Commercial return on Capital. If. a plant of this kind were to be operated as a wholly commercial venture, i.e., without direct Government assistance, a yield of less than 7 per cent, on the total capital embarked would, in the opinion of the Committee, be unattractive in view of the risks involved.154. Results of operations on basis of the comments made above. From what has been said above it is possible to calculate whether under present conditions the hydrogenation plant at Billingham is remunerative. The figures are set out in two columns the first column dealing with a calculation for the depreciation of the plant on the basis of a 20-year life (i.e., with no provision for obsolescence), and the second column showing results on the basis of a charge for depreciation and obsolescence combined, sufficient to write off the plant within 10 years: Pence per gallon.Average price per gallon received by imperial chemical Industries, Ltd., during 1936      ...      12-20 12-20Deduct -Works costs (including works overheads)        9-67 9-67Works profit before providing for depreciationand obsolescence ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       2-53 2-53Deduct Provision for depreciation at 5 per cent.       2-13 Provision for  depreciation and obsolescent-lescence at 10 per cent.        ...      ... ... 4-25Profit (or loss) after charging depreciation      (profit)  0-40Profit (or loss) after charging depreciation andobsolescence        ...      ...      ...      ...      ... ...    (loss) 1-72A reasonable commercial yield on capital (if taken at 7 per cent.) would represent ...      ... 2-98 2-98(b) A New Hydrogenation Plant.155. Capital Cost. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., consider, as a result of the experience gained at Billingham, that a plant with a capacity of 150,000 tons of petrol per annum is the smallest economic unit. In fact, the Company would be inclined, if it were considering the erection of further plants as a commercial proposition, to build even larger units, up to a capacity of 250,000-300,000 tons of petrol production per annum.156. The estimated cost of a new plant of 150,000 tons capacity is  8 million. This amount is made up of  7^ million for cost of erection and  f million in respect of research and interest on capital during construction; licence fees to International Hydrogenation Patents, Ltd.; and working, capital. The estimate of  8 million takes into account the increased cost of -wages, materials, &amp;c, since the Billingham plant was built, and incorporates all the latest technical improvements, some of which will effect savings in capital charges.
157. Costs of Production. The works costs of production for petrol in a new plant was given as 7-2d. With recent increases in the price of coal, this might have to be increased, and the Company state that each additional Is. on the price per ton of coal adds -IQd. to the cost per gallon of petrol.158. Realisation Price. In the case of any further plants, it is understood that, under the arrangements made with International Hydrogenation Patents, Ltd., for the marketing of the products, a rather lower quota of No. 1 Motor Spirit would have to be accepted. This would result in a reduction of the average realisation price as compared with that received for the Billingham output. An exact figure cannot be given, but it is doubtful whether on the basis of current prices of imported motor spirit more than 12d. a gallon could safely be taken.159. Result of Operations. Using the same bases in respect of depreciation, obsolescence and commercial return on capital as were taken in the case of the existing Billingham plant, the following&apos;results are obtained : Pence per Gallon.Estimated average realisation price	12	00	12	00Deduct -				Works costs (including works overheads)	7-20		7	20Works profit before providing for depreciation and obsolescence ...	4	80	4	80Deduct 				Provision for depreciation at 5 per cent.

Thus, with a new plant working on coal only, and assuming the continuance of a preference of Sd. a gallon, there would (after allowing a commercial yield on capital at 7 per cent.) be a small loss on the basis of a 5 per cent, depreciation, while, with a 10 per cent, allowance to cover depreciation and obsolescence, there would be a deficit of about 2\d. a gallon.Further Development of Hydrogenation.- 161. In view of the great interest which Imperial Chemical Industries, L,td., have shown in the hydrogenation process, the Committee considered it desirable to ascertain the views of the Company concerning the possibilities of further developments. These views are summarised in the following para-graphs.162. Under present conditions the Company would not be prepared to enter into any extension of their commitments in regard to further hydrogenation development, nor did they anticipate that any other commercial organisation would be prepared to do so.163. The British Hydrocarbon Oils Production Act, 1934, under which the preference on home-produced oils is guaranteed, will expire, at the present rate of preference, in October, 1939, and the period remaining would barely allow for the completion of any new plant, and, therefore, would be of no assistance during its operation.
164. The Company stated that even if the guarantee of protection were unlimited, they would not extend their hydrogenation commitments for at least another two years, when they would have derived full benefit from the Billingham experience. They felt that anything of so national a character as oil from coal, considered as a defence measure, required participation by wider interests, but that they would be prepared to consider contributing a certain amount. They would also be prepared to assist any venture with the necessary licensing, design, construction and management in return for a reasonable remuneration, which tentatively they estimated would represent about \d. per gallon of petrol produced.165. If the Government desired that the further development of hydrogenation by commercial interests should be undertaken, it was the Company&apos;s view that the scope of the Government assistance necessary would have to cover (a) An additional guarantee period under the above Act for a sufficient. length of time and at a rate to make any additional proposition commercially economic.(b) A rate of return on equity capital of not less than 7 per cent.(c) The provision of sufficient allowance for depreciation and obsolescenceduring the guarantee period.The form and extent of assistance should be equated over the extended guarantee period to provide for fluctuations in the price of the products, labour and raw materials.166. With regard to the above three conditions, the Company felt that these questions were so inter-related that it was difficult to estimate with any accuracy the period for which the assistance would be necessary, but if the preference remained at 8d. per gallon, the period should be at least 10 years.167. Dealing with condition (&amp;), the Company envisaged that the major part of the capital required might be obtained from the public by means of an issue of debentures guaranteed by the Government. If it could be shown that the possibilities of the enterprise were such as to afford a reasonable prospect of a return on the equity capital at 7 per cent., the Company indicated that, either alone or in conjunction with other interests, they would be disposed to weigh carefully the desirability of extending their own investment interest in this field. The Committee have expressed the opinion, in paragraph 153, that, from a purely commercial point of view, a return of 7 per cent, on the whole of the capital embarked in an enterprise of this nature would not be excessive in view of the risks involved. It therefore follows that a return of 7 per cent, on the equity portion of the capital is, in the Committee&apos;s view, a modest one.(ii) Synthetic Processes.168. The processes classed under this heading belong to the same category as hydrogenation, inasmuch as the sole object of both is the conversion of coal into oil, without solid by-products other than waxes. In their technical aspects, however, the methods differ widely.169. There are two of these processes, one of which is being developed at present in Germany, viz. : the Fischer-Tropsch process (generally called the Fischer process), and the other, the Robinson Bindley process, is being investigated in this country in a semi-commercial unit.The Fischer Process.170. This process is founded oh experiments carried out in Germany by Professor Franz Fischer and Dr. Tropsch over a number of years. It has recently found great favour in that country,, and large developments are taking place there. Plants are also reported to be in operation or under consideration in other-countries, including Japan, France and South Africa.171. The Committee has considered much data relating to the technical methods and costs of this process, and to developments which are reported to be-taking place abroad.  A summary of this will be found in Appendix No. V.
172! As only small-scale laboratory experiments have so far been carried out in Great Britain, it follows that there is no practical experience available of the working of the process in this country. Accordingly, the data received is of a different character from that which has been made available to the Committee in regard to hydrogenation. Facilities for a proper technical investigation of the process in Germany are only accorded to those willing to pay a substantial fee to Ruhrchemie, the German owners of the patent rights, as a preliminary to acquiring a licence, a step which no concern in this country has so far taken.173. The considerable scale of development which is taking place in Germany caused the Committee to consider whether they should make arrange-ments to visit one of the plants there; an invitation to do so was received from Dr. Martin of Ruhrchemie. But they decided that a visit, without the possibility of a detailed investigation by technical experts, would not be likely to add materially to the data which has been made available to the Committee in evidence; for among those who appeared before the Committee were several technical and commercial experts who have been given facilities to visit some of the plants. Included among these was a consultant, who, in his capacity as adviser to a concern which has applied for a licence for a plant in South Africa, has actually carried out a technical investigation for his clients. While this witness was not permitted to disclose the details of this investigation, he was able to express opinions based on the knowledge thus gained.174. Certain important industrial concerns in this country have given close consideration to the possibility of establishing a plant here. At one stage these concerns were brought together by His,Majesty&apos;s Government and invited to consider whether they could submit, either individually or acting together, a reasonable business proposition to the Government which envisaged the establish-ment of a plant.175. The Committee have been informed that it was not found possible for these three concerns to reach agreement in regard to a scheme, although two of them, the Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd., and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ltd., sent representatives to Germany to make a joint inquiry.176. The third party in these discussions was Colonel K. C. Appleyard, Managing Director of the Birtley Company, Ltd., and Koppers Coke Oven Company, Ltd., Sheffield, and the adviser to Ruhrchemie in Great Britain, who stated that he was acting in association with financial colleagues and certain definite industrial groups.177. The three interests therefore represented important groups concerned with the coal industry, the oil industry and the plant construction industry, one of them having an official association with Ruhrchemie. If such a combination had been prepared to undertake the erection of a Fischer plant, it would have constituted an important step in the investigation of this process on a commercial scale in this country. The fact that the attempt failed is also a matter of importance, because it indicated that there was a divergence of views in regard either to (1) the value of the process to this country; (2) the stage of development which has been reached; or (3) the procedure to be followed for establishing the process here.178. The Committee took a considerable amount of evidence in regard to this process.  A list of the witnesses is given in the Appendix.179. Some of the witnesses who were prepared to suggest that the Fischer process should be developed on a commercial scale in this country, were obviously influenced in their views largely because of the scale of development which is taking place in Germany. Some went so far as to say that the Fischer process was being developed to the exclusion of the Bergius hydrogenation process. While it was impossible to obtain official confirmation on the point, the general views expressed to the Committee go to show that both processes are being developed as part of the policy of the German Government to make Germany self-supporting in regard to supplies of motor fuels.   But whereas in the case of hydrogenation
there has been, both in Germany and in this country, experience of large commer-cial scale operations over a number of years, with the Fischer process, such experience is only very recent. The first semi-commercial scale plant did not begin operations until August, 1936. It follows, therefore, that the operation of commercial scale plants is still to a large extent in the development stage, and time must elapse before the most suitable methods of &apos;&apos; working up &apos;&apos; the crude product can be established (see paragraph 184 below). The Committee have taken evidence on the Fischer process at intervals during the course of their enquiry, and even in a period of a few months the information received indicates that considerable changes have taken place in the operation of the process.180. It is also important to bear in mind that in Germany a substantial proportion of the raw material used in these oil from coal processes is brown coal, of which very large supplies are readily obtainable, at a much cheaper rate than bituminous coal. In this country no commercial supplies of indigenous brown coal are available.181. In the following paragraphs the Committee summarize the more important points which have emerged from the evidence they have received.182. Preparation of Gas for the Synthesis. There are several methods of preparing the synthesis gas, but opinions varied as to which was the most suitable. The alternatives of gas from coke ovens supplemented by water gas made from coke, or the carbonising of coal, and using the coke for making water gas, which is subsequently converted to synthesis gas, are the two methods most favoured. It was also suggested that water gas could be made by the direct gasification of coal, and if this were practicable it would be a matter of some importance in this country, as it would enable non-coking instead of coking coals to be used. But the witnesses who put forward the suggestion agreed that this method had not been definitely established on a commercial scale. They proposed, therefore, that the Government should consider assisting research on this problem in connection with any Fischer plant which might be established in this country. In regard to this suggestion, the Committee have been informed that research on this problem is already being carried out at the Fuel Research Station.183. Yields of products. Information on this point was very difficult to establish. The product obtained from the synthesis of the gas is known as the primary product and consists of gaseous, liquid and solid hydrocarbons. The primary product has to-be further treated to obtain the final commercial products. The liquid primary product can be distilled to produce petrol, diesel oil and soft and hard wax; or it can be cracked to produce mainly petrol.184. Although samples of the primary products have been obtained and treated by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ltd., the Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd., and the Fuel Research Station, there would appear at present to be no substantial measure of agreement as to what is the best method of treatment, or as to; what products would give the most economic return in this country.185. The petrol obtained by distillation is admitted to be of low octane number. It can be improved by cracking, although this involves a material reduction in the yield. A high cetene number diesel oil can be made, although the yield varies considerably according to the method of treating the primary product. The Committee were informed that Ruhrchemie have recently claimed that an aviation spirit with an octane number exceeding 90 is now being produced, but that the German Government have given instructions that this development is to be regarded as secret. No information is available, therefore, of the yields obtained or of the costs.186. A lubricating oil can be produced, but it has proved impossible to obtain definite information as to the stage of development reached. Samples of oil which have been supplied for test in this country are not regarded as fully satisfactory. Nevertheless, in recent evidence submitted to the Committee, it is stated that Ruhrchemie maintain that high-grade lubricating oils are being-produced, though here again the yields are not known.
187. The liquefiable gases can be used either as a basis for the manufacture of further chemical products, such as ketones or polymer gasolines, or, alter-natively, they could be sold as liquefied gas for motor vehicles and other purposes. It has been suggested that a large-scale development might lead to the creation of an important chemical industry. Sir Alexander Walker, of the Distillers&apos; Company, whose firm has shown a considerable interest in this side of the question, informed the Committee that he had not yet obtained sufficient data to be able to express any definite view on these possibilities.188. Provision of Catalyst. This is a matter of considerable importance, and the arrangements necessary for the manufacture of the catalyst and its periodical purification and regeneration represent a fairly expensive item. The smallest plant which can justify a separate catalyst-making plant is stated to be one of 60,000 tons capacity of primary product. If a smaller plant is established, the cost of the provision for the catalyst will, therefore, be relatively high. In Germany there is a central factory for making and supplying the catalyst to the various plants, and a similar provision would have to be made in this country if the process is developed on a considerable scale.189. Quantity of Coal required. It was difficult to secure definite data on this point. The only guarantee which Ruhrchemie is prepared to give is that a yield of 115 grammes of primary product will be obtained from each cubic metre of synthesis gas. (It was stated in later evidence that this figure has since been raised to 140 grammes.) As the methods of preparing the synthesis gas vary, it is not possible to be definite regarding the quantity of coal that would be required. The kind of coal, its ash and moisture content, &amp;c, are also factors. But a figure of between 5 and 6 tons of coal per ton of primary product seemed to be generally accepted.190. Financial aspect. Turning to the financial and economic side, the same uncertainty exists owing to the paucity of reliable information and the difficulty, even where figures are obtainable from Germany, of translating these into data which would be applicable to this country.191. Capital Cost of Plants. A number of estimates have been supplied to the Committee, Avhich range from  1 million to  1J million for a plant to produce 20,000 tons of primary product to  4 million to  4^ million for a 100,000-ton plant.192. Costs of production. Until more information is available as to the most suitable methods of treating the primary product in this country, and of the resulting products which will give the best economic return, it is obviously impossible to obtain any reliable data as to costs of production. One witness gave figures of the average costs of production of marketable products which ranged from 12-79*2. to 15-04*2. per gallon, according to the period allowed for amortisa-tion of the capital. The average realisation price taken was 13-05^. Another stated that, on the basis of the best yields of products which he could at present accept, the overall cost of the primary product would not have to exceed 10 -5d., and finished products an average of 12 - 75d. per gallon, if proceeds were to equal costs. He had not sufficient data to say whether such results were practicable. Generally the evidence appears to indicate that the costs of production in the case of this process are not likely to be less than those of the hydrogenation process.193. Depreciation and Obsolescence. Colonel Appleyard gave the Committee a figure of 7 per cent, (representing approximately a 15 years life), on that portion of the capital representing the cost of the plant, while Sir Stephenson Kent produced a statement showing figures for amortisation of capital over 10, 12, 15 and 20 years. On the basis of the capital being amortised in 20 years respectively, a small balance of profit was shown. The Committee felt, however, that the prices taken for certain products were optimistic, and if they were justified in their criticism, the results would be even less favourable than were shown in the statement submitted to them.
283194. Government assistance. It is clear from the evidence obtained that a considerable measure of assistance in some form from the Government would be required before any commercial undertaking would contemplate the erection of a plant. As regards the question of the guaranteed preference, the period suggested was usually about 12 years, although a period of 20 years was also mentioned.195. Colonel Appleyard appeared to be confident that if a guarantee for 12 years were given, private enterprise would find the capital for a plant of, say, 20,000 tons capacity. Sir Stephenson Kent, on the other hand, who at first suggested that, in addition to a guaranteed preference, the Government should find or guarantee three-fourths of the capital for a 30-35,000 ton plant, finally wrote to the Committee and gave it as his considered view that the provision of capital for such a venture was not a matter for a commercial concern and that the Government should find the whole amount.196. While the Committee have not been able to obtain data which they could accept as reliable in regard to the points which have been set forth above, there are certain features about the Fischer process which they consider merit closer investigation in this country. These are, more particularly, the possibility of the production of diesel and lubricating oils, unsaturated hydrocarbon gases and high octane fuels. Research work on the process is already being carried out at the Fuel Research Station, and the Committee hope that this will be continued. But the Committee were impressed by the views submitted to them by several important witnesses that the determination of the value of the process to this country can only be secured if a plant on a commercial scale is available. The Committee consider that a plant of a capacity of 20,000 tons per annum of primary product would be of sufficient size for the purpose.The Robinson Bindley Process.197. This process, in its main features, is closely allied to the Fischer method, though it differs from it in certain respects, which the Company owning the process claim to be important, and which have been protected by patents.198. The process has been developed during the past few years on an experi-mental scale by a British group, which includes certain important colliery interests.199. A few months ago it was decided that a stage had been reached when a semi-commercial plant should be established, to cost about  50,000. The plant is being built in Scotland at one of the coke oven installations owned by Messrs. Wm. Baird and Co., Ltd.200. Considerable interest is being shown in this development. Messrs. Wm. Baird, the Distillers&apos; Company and others have taken a small financial interest, and the Fuel Research Station is collaborating with the Company in carrying out research work. In their evidence before the Committee, the Company mentioned also that an agreement had been entered into with Messrs. Kellogg and Company of the U.S.A., an important concern with great experience in the oil-refining industry, for the provision of technical advice and assistance.201. The plant now being built, which it is hoped will begin operations by the end of this year, will be designed to have a production of about 200 tons of petrol a year. This is a small output, but if the experiment is successful it is understood that units of this size will be suitable to form the basis of larger plants.202. The Company stated, that it would be a year from the time the semi-commercial scale plant began to operate before useful data would be available on which the value of the process could be assessed.203. The Committee do not feel, however, that at this stage they could express any opinion on this process. They welcome the co-operation of the Fuel Research Station with the Company.
Section III.THE ECONOMIC ASPECT OE THE HOME PRODUCTION OF OIL.204. The wide publicity which has been given to the fact that it is tech-nically possible to produce oil from coal has, not unnaturally, raised great hopes. This possibility has been seen by some as the salvation of the coal-mining industry, and even in responsible quarters the belief has been expressed that a large increase in prosperity would result from the development of these oil producing processes.205. With these ideas in general there is bound to be much sympathy, and the desire to have these scientific discoveries translated as quickly as possible into industrial processes for the national benefit is a very laudable one. Certainly it would be a matter of first class importance if it were found practicable to build up, on a sound economic basis, a large new industry based on our great natural asset, coal.206. But the step from technical achievement to economic success may be a long one, and this is not sufficiently appreciated. As one instance of the confusion which exists in many minds on these matters the statement is frequently made that fuel oil for the navy should be produced from home sources. The Committee have previously pointed out that this grade of oil is the most easily obtainable of all petroleum products; and is also the cheapest. It is, therefore, the least suitable to be produced by an expensive process which, if operated at all, should be used for the production of the more costly and less easily obtainable fuels. The same reasoning applies to diesel oil and the lower grades of petrol.207. From what has been said in Section I, it is clear that in normal times this country has no difficulty in obtaining the oil supplies it requires from overseas. A large proportion of these supplies are the direct result of British enterprise abroad, although the amount produced within the British Empire is small. In addition, comparing the costs of producing oils from materials indigenous to Great Britain as given in Section II, with those of imported supplies (Table 4, Appendix I), there is at present a wide margin in favour of the latter.208. The Committee have given consideration, in paragraphs 40 and 41, to the question whether, with increasing consumption in all parts of the world, the time may come when supplies of petroleum oils.may not be so freely available, and in consequence the price may rise. But they cannot see the possibility of a serious advance in world prices occurring within such a period as would justify this factor being taken into account now in any comparison of the costs of supplies from the two sources.209. In these circumstances, it is abundantly evident that, so long as the price of imported fuel remains in the neighbourhood of the present figure, the case for home-produced oil, judged by purely economic standards, falls to the ground. Hence it follows that if it is desirable for any of the reasons mentioned in paragraph 217 to produce oil from coal or other indigenous materials, Government assistance in one form or another must be forthcoming.Form and Extent of Present Government Assistance.210. Since 1928, it has been the policy of successive Governments to give some special assistance for the encouragement of the production of oil products from indigenous materials. For when in that year, a duty of 4c?. a gallon was placed on motor spirit imported into this country, home-produced motor spirit was exempted. At that date the home production&apos; of motor spirit was limited to that obtained from shale oil, and from the carbonisation of coal, the total quantity being inconsiderable. But in 1934, the Government went further and sought to induce private enterprise to provide the capital necessary to secure the commercial scale development of a process for the treatment of coal, where
oil was the main product. The inducement took the form of a guaranteed preference over a period of years on all home-produced motor spirit which, besides affording a large measure of protection, provided an element of stability. It was hoped that this would be sufficient to encourage the establishment of the necessary manufacturing plants by enterprising firms.211. A guaranteed preference of not less than \.d. a gallon was granted for a period of nine years from the 1st April, 1935. The Act provided that if the preference actually granted were greater than 4d., the period should be correspondingly reduced. Owing to the operation of this provision (the preference actually given so far has amounted to 8d. a gallon), the Act is likely to expire in September, 1939; or in four and a half instead of nine years.212. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., made a great effort to secure the benefit of the provisions of the Act, and, following the announcement of Government policy in July, 1933, took steps to construct, as expeditiously as possible, the hydrogenation plant at Billingham, to wrhich reference has been made in Section II. This plant did in fact begin operations on a partial scale just before the beginning of the nine years&apos; period referred to in the previous paragraph; but the time during which the plant has been operating, on a considerable scale is too short to enable a definite conclusion to be reached of its ultimate possibilities, and the erection of any further plant by the Company, as a commercial venture, is out of the question under present conditions. As explained in paragraph 134, it is recognised that in regard to the treatment of coal the existing plant will not attain the results originally hoped for by the Company&apos;s technical experts. The Company have already spent considerable sums in modifying and improving the plant, but with the prospect of the 1934 Act coming to an end in less than two years, there is now7 little inducement to spend additional money for this purpose.213. In addition to the establishment of the hydrogenation plant at Billingham, other definite advantages have already resulted from the Act, even in the short period which has elapsed since 1934. For there has been a material increase in the home production of motor spirit from the by-product industries, while the shale oil industry has probably been saved from extinction.214. The additional production which has resulted from the guaranteed preference has naturally led to the foregoing by the Exchequer of a considerably increased amount of revenue. The Committee have been informed that, if since the 1st April, 1935, the effective date of operation of the 1934 Act, to the end of 1936, the latest date for which particulars are available, the whole of the home-produced motor spirit had been replaced by imported spirit, the extra revenue which the Exchequer would have received would have been about  5,120,000. When considering the cost to the Exchequer, however, other factors have to be taken into account, such as the beneficial effect of home production on employment, and the taxation leviable upon profits arising from the home industries. It is difficult to estimate what proportion of the additional produc-tion from the by-product industries has been due to the operation of the Act, but taking the production from hydrogenation and the shale oil industry only, the value of the extra revenue which would have been received would be  2,250,000. From the Exchequer point of view oil from coal processes have thus been encouraged to a very considerable extent.215. The Chancellor of the Exchequer could have reduced the amount by imposing an excise, duty up to 4.d. a gallon on home-produced spirit, and this-would have maintained the guaranteed preference over a longer period; but no&apos; such action has. been taken. The automatic shortening of the period of the guarantee to four- and a half years will mean that in the near future a review of the Government policy will have to take place.216. Heavy oils- produced from indigenous materials have, since 1933, received a preference of Id. per gallon, and diesel oil used in motor vehicles, a preference of 8d. per gallon since August, 1935, although without a guarantee-such as applies in the case of motor spirit.
O 9 FX(-J ij *JaiReasons advanced for Stimulating Home Production.217. The reasons advanced for the desirability of producing oil from home sources are : (a) provision of employment;b) technical and industrial development;c) defence.(a) Employment.218. The Committee have given much thought to this aspect of the question, for they fully realise how important it would be, as a contribution towards solving the unemployment problem, if there were a real possibility of establishing a great new industry. They have, therefore, carefully examined each of the groups of processes for obtaining oil from coal and other indigenous materials in the light of the additional employment which might be provided. Taking each group in the order in which they have been previously examined in Section II, the conclusions the Committee have arrived at are set out below : 219. The Shale Oil Industry. The Scottish Shale Oil Industry, after a long period of great difficulty, is now, largely as a result of the preference granted to home-produced oil, making a moderate commercial profit and finds employment for some 4,300 persons see paragraph 64.220. It is possible, if the continuance of the preference were assured, that a further expansion might take place, and. that in the course of a few years employ-ment in this industry could be doubled. The investigations of the Committee do not lead it to anticipate, however, that any great increase beyond this is practicable.221. The Gas and Coke Oven Industries. -These industries are long estab-lished and their output is regulated mainly by the demand for their primary products, i.e., gas and coke, rather than by the production of liquid by-products. If the smaller gas undertakings stripped their gas for benzole, a few more men might find employment, but the numbers would be small.222. Low Temperature Carbonisation. The development of this type of process has been strongly advocated by some as a means for re-establishing the coal mining industry.223. As indicated in paragraph 118, the main product of the industry is an alternative solid fuel for one that is already in use. In paragraph 122 it is stated that it has been estimated that some 10 per cent, more coal would have to be mined to produce, on the basis of thermal value, an amount of fuel equivalent to the coal now used. More men would be employed in the mining industry to the extent of the increased output, and, in addition, employment, would be offered in the carbonising plants and in manufacturing- the plants, but this would not be great.224. As against the possibility of some additional employment the Committee have already drawn attention in paragraph 123 to the views expressed by the representatives of the coal industry as to the possible adverse effects which might arise in other directions on that industry should there be a large develop-ment of low temperature carbonisation.225. In order that low temperature carbonisation might provide any substantial amount of additional employment it would be necessary that a very large development should take place. The Committee have examined this possibility in paragraph 124, and they do not consider that it is likely to happen within a reasonable period.226. Hydrogenation and Synthetic Processes. The limitations which have been referred to in the cases already dealt with do not arise with these processes; for the main product is oil, and there is no residual solid fuel to be disposed of in
competition with coal. The successful operation on a large scale of these processes would, therefore, produce an entirely new demand for coal, and offer greater opportunities for the creation of employment in the mining industry, as well as directly at the plants. Since, however, the development of these processes cannot be achieved on a strictly economic basis, it becomes necessary to consider at what cost the additional employment could be provided in present circumstances.227. Hydrogenation Process. The information supplied to the Committee indicates that for this process a plant with a production capacity of 150,000 tons per annum of motor spirit would afford direct employment to some 2,000 persons on the plant, and a further 4,000 in the mining and secondary industries, giving a total employment figure of 6,000. Unfortunately, the cost of erecting such a plant is very great, amounting, on the basis of the present cost of wages and materials, to about  8,000,000. This would work out at a capital cost of  1,333 per man employed. In addition, on the basis of the present preference of 8d. per gallon, there would be a loss of revenue to the Exchequer which would represent at least  250 per annum per man. The cost of providing work by this means would, therefore, be very high. It would represent from the Revenue point of view alone a continuing assistance amounting to about  5 per week per person employed.228. Synthetic Processes. Though reliable figures are not available for these processes, the information furnished to the Committee indicates that they are not likely to be very different from those given for the hydrogenation process.229. The Committee, therefore, find themselves driven to the conclusion that, viewed solely from the point of view of providing a large measure of employment, the hydrogenation and synthetic processes do not at present offer a very hopeful prospect, m relation to the cost which would be involved. In this view they are supported by one important witness, who, while advocating the development of these processes for other reasons, used the following words as regards their effect on employment :-&quot; Any idea that oil from coal can provide sudden salvation for the coal industry is clearly foolish.&quot;(b) Technical and Industrial Development.230. This aspect of the question raises considerations which are of a somewhat different order. It is admitted in most quarters that the developments which are taking place in the hydrogenation and synthetic processes offer possibilities which may, at a future date, be of great value to this country. The question therefore arises whether, on this ground, it is desirable to take any special action to expedite the progress which is being made.231. The witnesses who have given evidence before the Committee have represented a wide range of views. Some, even though they see little hope of the production of oil products from indigenous materials becoming an economic proposition within a reasonable period, nevertheless suggested that the matter ought to be closely watched, and that research on an adequate scale should be continued. Others pressed that the time had come when commercial scale produc-tion should be expedited with such additional assistance from the Exchequer as might be necessary.232. The Committee agree that research should be continued, but it is also&apos; clear to them that, in order properly to assess the technical and industrial possibilities of these processes, some development on a commercial scale of operations is necessary.233. The Committee have drawn attention to what is being done in Germany and certain other countries, and they have pointed out that there are good reasons why this country ^should not necessarily follow closely the action which is being taken abroad. Nevertheless, they feel that Great Britain cannot afford to lag behind other countries in exploring, on a sufficiently large scale, processes of this character which may ultimately prove to be of benefit, not only in regard to the production of oil, but also perhaps in providing raw materials for the chemical-industry.
234. It is important that this country should be able to have experience at first hand of the working of these new processes, and it is essential, in the view of the Committee, that there should be trained a sufficient personnel with the necessary technical experience related to such processes. It has often been said of this country that we are too prone to allow others to work out inventions and build up new industries.  There may be some truth in the criticism.235. The Committee consider that it would be unfortunate if a lack of enterprise were to be shown in the case of these oil from coal processes, more particularly as this country possesses great quantities of suitable raw material. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., have carried out tests on coals from a number of districts which might be suitable for the hydrogenation process with satisfactory results. In the case of South Wales, the tests were conducted at the expense of the Government, and the Company are satisfied that sufficient quantities of coal are available to provide what would be required for a plant in that area. The synthetic process would, in the early stages of development, probably use coking, or a blend of coking and non-coking, coals. Neither the hydrogenation nor the synthetic processes can, unfortunately, at present use the hard steam coals produced in South Wales, the markets for which have seriously declined. In the case of the synthetic process, the Committee understand that it may be possible to make the synthesis gas from such coals, although the method is not yet established on a commercial scale.236. As to the actual scale of operations which would be necessary to achieve what the Committee have in mind, there may be some difference of opinion. But the Committee feel that, if really useful experience is to be obtained, the size of future plants to be installed should not be less than will provide technical and economic data which could be used to determine the possibilities of large-scale development.(c) Defence.237. This aspect of the question is dealt with in Section IV, and certain directions are indicated in which the home production of oil may, even in present circumstances, be of value.Further Development in Peace Time and Assistance Proposed.238. The Committee have given the most careful consideration to the action which they consider should be taken in order to secure the maintenance of the present interest, and that measure of further development which in their view is called for.239. Most of the proposals submitted to the Committee have involved a large measure of Government assistance, including both an extension of the guaranteed preference for a number of years, and some form of provision of capital. So far, except in one or two cases of low temperature carbonisation plants, dealt with under the Special Areas Acts, the Government have not granted direct financial assistance.240. The Committee agree that, so far, the results of the hydrogenation and synthetic processes are not sufficiently established to justify the spending of large sums of public money in building plants. They feel, however, that serious interest is only likely to be maintained if there continues to be available a measure of assistance which will give commercial interests a prospect of a reasonable financial return. The Committee therefore favour a continuation of the form of assistance at present given by the guaranteed preference. They consider, however, that a higher rate than 4rf. is necessary and that the guarantee should cover a longer period than has proved to be available under the present Act.241.   Experience gained before the passing of the 1934 Act clearly showed that a preference alone without a guarantee, even if it be the large amount such as was then carried on from year to year by the Finance Act, did not provide a sufficient incentive to industrial concerns to invest money in new developments. [16154] F
This was particularly the case with the processes designed to produce oil as the primary product, where large capital expenditure was involved; but it applied also to the existing carbonisation and shale oil industries, where new and up-to-date plant had necessarily to be installed if an increased yield of oil products was to be obtained.242. One of the difficulties with the processes designed for the production of oil as the primary product is that not only are the large-scale plants expensive to build, but in the earlier stages, one of the main factors which renders them commercially unprofitable is the heavy allowance required to be made under the head of obsolescence. For, as improvements are discovered, it is often impossible to apply them without extensive alterations or reconstruction of plant.243. Experience may indeed show that a guaranteed preference, even of a larger amount than is at present afforded, will not result in further plants being built.   If that should prove to be the there will be no further loss of2&apos;evenue to the Exchequer. If, on the other hand, there should be some further foregoing of revenue, it will be because private enterprise has been willing to do its part in attempting to carry further these important developments.244. The Committee are of opinion that the amount of assistance at present required is certainly not less than the rate of preference at present actually given, viz., 8d. a gallon. They also consider that a preference at this rate should be guaranteed for a period of 12 years from 1938, and that it should apply to diesel oil for use in motor vehicles as well as to motor spirit. The period suggested may appear to be a long one, but a considerable time is required to build new plants, and experience at Billingham has clearly shown that after the plant is completed much time is required to deal with difficulties which emerge with commercial scale working.245. If this recommendation is accepted by the Government, the Committee are hopeful that some of the commercial interests which have been investigating the synthetic process would be prepared to establish a Fischer plant of a capacity of 20-30,000 tons, which, as already indicated in Section II, can be regarded as of a sufficient size to give commercial data. There would then, as a minimum, be two commercial scale plants in this country, one for each of the processes designed primarily to produce oil. With a degree of protection such as the Committee recommend, they hope that from these developments some further expansion will result in the course of a few years. If the very substantial incentive suggested, amounting to something approaching a 200 per cent, protective tariff, fails to achieve results, then it would only be reasonable to conclude that these processes are at present so far removed from economic success that any other form of assistance would not be justified.246. Without a continuance of help of this kind, the Committee are of opinion that the production of oil products from the carbonisation industries will also decline. In regard to these industries, the Committee consider that it is a sound policy to secure the fullest possible recovery of by-products obtainable in the treatment of coal; and, while these industries cannot in the nature of things make a really large contribution to the oil supplies needed by this country, the Committee would regard it as a retrograde step if this source of production were to be reduced through the withdrawal of the assistance now given. In addition, as the Committee have already pointed out, the shale oil industry would again lapse into a parlous condition, at a time when, as they were informed, there are definite prospects of its activities being extended.247. In putting forward the particular form of assistance suggested, the Committee are advocating the adoption of a long-term policy which they believe, in the circumstances, is the correct policy to adopt..248. In view, however, of the fact that the amount of the guaranteed preference which they-recommend is equal to the present rate of duty on imported motor spirit and road diesel oil, the Committee have considered whether it is practicable to provide the Exchequer with means, in substitution for those which are provided in the Act of 1934, for protecting the revenue, should a material change in existing conditions take place.   Under the existing Act there was a
margin of 4d. per gallon between the amount of the guaranteed preference and the rate of preference actually granted. It was thus possible, without interfering with the guarantee, to protect the revenue to a great extent, either by means of. an excise duty or by shortening the period. Under the Committee&apos;s proposal that possibility will no longer exist. Moreover, if the guarantee is to achieve its object, it is important, in the view of the Committee, that any change for which it might be considered necessary to provide, should clearly be related to definite factors which can be prescribed&apos; in the legislation giving effect to the guarantee. The Committee have recommended a guaranteed preference of 8d. per gallon because they are convinced that this measure of assistance is necessary under present conditions to help those processes which are primarily concerned with the production of oil. If the present competitive position of home-produced oils were to improve, the Committee agree that it would not be unreasonable to re-assess the amount of the preference, should a satisfactory basis for doing this be established.249. In this connection the Committee consider that it is only fair to point out that, while it is hoped that the margin between the overall costs of production of home-produced oil and the price of imported oil may lessen, certain factors&apos; may operate to cause the present margin in favour of imported oil to increase still further. These factors are the possibility of increases in the cost of materials (including coal) and wages in connection with oil from coal plants, and a decrease, in the c.i.f. values of imported oils. It would only be possible to meet such a contingency by the grant of direct financial assistance, which the Committee do not recommend, and they are of opinion that the risk is one which those who may undertake the development of oil from coal processes will have to face.250. On the other hand, the chief factors which may strengthen the competitive position of home-produced oils are-^(1) a material increase in the price of imported oils;(2) a large decrease in the cost of the principal raw material coal; and(3) improvements in the technique of the processes of such an extent as would lower costs of production.251. In regard to (1), the Committee consider that it should not be difficult to make provision to cover this possibility. It would be necessary to fix a datum period, and this, it is suggested, should be the year 1937. Particulars are published in the Trade and Navigation Returns of the average declared c.i.f. values of motor spirit and gas oil, and these would appear to provide a sufficient measure of any changes in the landed cost of motor spirit and road diesel oil. The Committee propose that if in respect of the year 1941, or any subsequent year, the average declared c.i.f. value of motor spirit or gas oil has exceeded the average figures for 1937 by not less than Id. per gallon, the amount of the guaranteed preference on motor spirit and road diesel oil respectively should be reduced by one \d. per gallon in respect of the first Id. of the excess, and for each additional \d. of the excess beyond Id. a further reduction of \d.252. In regard to (2), the Committee have pointed out in paragraph 157 that each Is. increase or decrease in the price of coal makes a difference of -lQd. in the cost of petrol per gallon in the case of the hydrogenation process. A somewhat similar figure would probably also apply to the Fischer process. The price of coal would therefore have to vary by about 6s. a ton to affect the production cost of motor spirit to the extent of Id. per gallon. The possibility of such a fall in the 1937 level of coal prices appears to the Committee to be so remote that they suggest that no provision need be made to cover this factor. .253. As regards (3), the Committee recognise that this is a more difficult&apos; factor to provide for. They gave consideration to the possibility of limiting the proposed new rate of guaranteed preference to a certain number of new plants; but they felt that there were substantial objections to such a course, the more important of which are : (a) that it would involve discrimination as between one process and another; and (&amp;) that it may hamper work in the earlier stages of new processes. The present guaranteed preference is available to all processes1 [&quot;16154] F 2
for producing motor spirit from indigenous materials, and the Committee are of opinion that there is a considerable advantage in preserving that basis under any extension of the preference.254. It is quite evident from the enquiries which the Committee have made that considerable improvements in technique would have to be effected in order to achieve any substantial saving in working costs. Such a possibility might, however, occur; and if it should eventuate, the Committee realise that, not only would it afford to those then engaged in the industry unduly high profits, but it would lead to a large increase in production, as existing undertakings would expand and new undertakings would spring up. The Committee therefore suggest that power might be taken in the legislation for a reduction in the amount of the guaranteed preference of Id. per gallon, should production from home sources of motor spirit or road diesel oil reach in 1941, or in any subsequent year, 20 per cent, of the home consumption, and that a further reduction of Id. per gallon might be effected for each additional 5 per cent.255. The Committee appreciate that numerous alternative sliding scales could be framed, and they have submitted that suggested above merely as a basis for consideration. They have, however, in putting forward the proposal, borne in mind the present situation and the present tendencies in regard to imported and home-produced oils, which may briefly be summarised as follows : Home-produced motor spirit represents about 7 per cent, of the total consumption. The average annual increase in total consumption over the last few years has been in the neighbourhood of 6 per cent., and in the absence of specially untoward circumstances, it is to be presumed that the consumption will still expand, although possibly at not so high a rate. From the above figures it will be realised that if each year the home production of oil increased by an amount representing 100 per cent, of its present level, this would do little more than take up the growth in total consumption; in other words, while the growth in the volume of imported motor fuels might be entirely arrested, the actual imports of these oils would not be diminished to any appreciable extent.256. The following pro forma calculation, based on a total consumption of 100 gallons, is of interest: The position at the present time is that on 93 gallons there is collected 8c?. while on the remaining 7 gallons nothing is collected     ...      ............      .........       744c?.If, under the sliding scale, the home production reached      --20 per cent, of the total, the guaranteed preference is reduced from 8c?. to 7d. The position would then be as follows : On 80 gallons there would be collected 8c?. per gallon ... 640c?. On 20 gallons there could be collected Id. per gallon   ...        20c?.660c?.If the home production reached 40 per cent, of the total consumption, then under the sliding scale the guaranteed preference on the home production would be reduced to 3c?. The following would then be the position : On 60 gallons there would be collected 8c?. per gallon ... 480c?. On 40 gallons there could be collected 5c?. per gallon   ...       200c?.680c?.While the ahove calculation shows a substantial loss to the Exchequer with home production at 20 per cent, of the total consumption, as compared with the position at present, it must be remembered that no account is taken of the probable further expansion of, total consumption, from which the Exchequer would, of course, derive benefit.257. With protection on the lines they have proposed, the Committee suggest that the Exchequer would be reasonably safeguarded.
Section IV.THE POSITION IN TIME OF WAR.258. The proposal has frequently been put forward that arrangements should be made for the production of large quantities of hydrocarbon oils from home resources as a means of supplying, or at any rate materially supplementing the supply of, these very important oils in time of war.259. Before it is possible to form any conclusion on the merits of this proposal, it is necessary to consider the estimated requirements of the country, including both civil and Service needs, in time of war, and the methods by which it is intended to meet these requirements. It will then be possible in the light of the information contained in Sections II and III to assess the contribution which home-produced oil might make.260. As the whole question of Empire oil requirements is kept constantly under review by the Oil Board, the Committee have not felt it necessary to do more than acquaint themselves with the main facts furnished by the Board, in order that they might be in a position to consider the second part of their Terms of Reference &quot; on the advantages to be obtained by way of security of oil supplies in emergency.&quot;National Requirements.261. It is estimated that by 1940, the requirements of oil for civil and industrial purposes will considerably exceed the present needs. The following table gives the figures for several years from 1913 to 1936, together with estimates for the year 1940, showing how rationing (which we understand would be introduced as soon as possible after the outbreak of war) would affect the 1940 figures : Estimated Anmial Civil Consumption of Petroleum Products in Great Britain and the anticipated Requirements in 1940.(1,000&apos;s of tons.)							1940.		1913.		1920.	1925.	1930.	1936.

In addition to the quantities of oil required to meet civil and industrial needs, the estimated Service requirements at &quot; home &quot; (i.e., for the use of the Services in this country and as far east as Suez), in the event of a European war, are about 7f million tons for the first year of war. The bulk of this represents fuel oil for the Navy, but it includes 600,000 tons of aviation spirit for the Royal Air Force.263. Allowing for the application of rationing in this country, the total estimated &quot;home&quot; consumption in 1940, in the event of war occurring in that year, will therefore be about 16f million tons of oil products.
Acquisition of Reserve Stocks.264. In order to meet these requirements, arrangements are already being made for building up stocks of the particular products needed by the Service Departments. The Admiralty will shortly hold in this country sufficient fuel to meet their demands during the first six months of war, and a similar reserve will be stored at naval depots abroad. The accepted Admiralty programme aims at a full 12 months&apos; reserve, and this programme will be completed before 1940.265. The War Office and Air Ministry are also building up stocks in this country equivalent to six months&apos; requirements, and progress is being made with these arrangements.266. In regard to civil and industrial needs, the Committee have been informed that the Committee of Imperial Defence have already approved a proposal that stocks equivalent to three months&apos; consumption on a rationed basis should be aimed at. In arriving at these figures, stocks in certain areas which are considered particularly vulnerable will be suitably discounted.267. Cost of Storage. The Committee have been furnished with figures of the capital cost of installing storage accommodation for fuel oil and spirit. Those for fuel oil vary from  1 10s. for overground tanks, to  9 per ton of storage capacity for completely protected tanks. Tanks for motor spirit are more costly, and range from  2 10s. per ton of capacity for overground tanks, to  10 per ton for protected tanks of the type approved.Expressed on an annual basis, the costs of storage per ton of spirit (reckoned at 300 gallons) are as follows : Overground ...   13s. Sd. (assuming interest on capital at 3 per cent.)17s. 9d. (    ,, ,, ,, 5     ,,     )Underground      orSemi-underground   16s. 4t.d. (    ,, ,, ,, 3 )22s. Od. (    ,, ,, ,, 5     ,,     )These costs include depreciation, maintenance and custody, leakage and evaporation losses and interest on both capital and purchase price of the fuel.Imported Supplies.268. Assuming that the reserves, both Service and civil, will be drawn upon to some extent, the Oil Board estimate that during the first year of war the quantity of new supplies which will have to be found will be in the neighbourhood of 13^ million tons.269. The Committee have been advised that the Oil Board do not anticipate any insuperable difficulty in obtaining this quantity of oil from overseas for the needs of the Services and the requirements of civil and industrial users.270.   There is, however, one very important exception to the above statement, &apos; namely, the supply of aviation spirit, and this will be discussed later in this&apos;. Section.   (See paragraphs 288-297.)Home Production compared with imported supplies.271. In making a comparison between the two methods of meeting the country&apos;s needs, viz., home production or supplies from overseas, there are a number of factors to be examined. Those which affect peace time conditions have been dealt with in Section III, and the Committee propose in this Section t6&apos; confine themselves to the more important of those which are relevant to war time problems.272. In Section II, it has been shown that it is possible to produce oil from indigenous resources by different methods; but the only methods which can be^ looked upon as potential sources of large supplies of oil are the hydrogenatioh. and the Fischer or similar processes.
9?^(j *j *j39273. On account of the low octane number of its motor spirit, and the lack of knowledge concerning the possible yields of high-grade oils, the Fischer process must still be considered, in spite of the development it has undergone in Germany, to be of uncertain value so far as the needs of this country are concerned. For the time being, therefore, it is to the hydrogenation of coal that the country would have to look if it were desired substantially to increase the output of oil from home resources; under present conditions the use of this process for the production of light oils is the only possibility which need be seriously considered.274. The most important of the factors which should be taken into consideration as affecting the war time problems appear to the Committee to be (A) Assurance of the extra supplies to meet the increased war time demand.(B) Effect on man-power.(C) Relative cost.(A) Assurance of extra supplies.275. The present position with regard to the home production of oil is that, while some 7 per cent, of the motor spirit used is produced in this country, the amounts of fuel oil, lubricating oil and other products are negligible. It will be seen, therefore, that, in order to play even a relatively minor part in supplying the oil required in time of war, a very great expansion in home production would have to take place. Such an expansion would mean the establishment of a number of large plants, involving heavy capital expenditure, and, because of the need for special steel and large forgings, would take a number of years to effect.276. It would not be practicable to allow the plants to remain idle until an emergency arose, for, if they were to do so, the difficulties of starting them up, of securing the supplies of coal, and obtaining trained technicians, would be considerable, and dangerous delay might result. They would, therefore, have to operate as and when they were completed. As the additional home production became available it would be balanced by a corresponding decrease of imports in peace time. At the present time there is a complete and efficient transport and distribution organisation supplying the needs of this country, and should the decrease in imports reach substantial proportions it is inevitable that it would ultimately result in the reduction in the facilities provided by the oil industry, and this might seriously prejudice the position in an emergency.277. In order that the great increase in consumption due to emergency demand may be met, it is essential that the source from which the normal supplies are drawn, whatever the means used for providing them, must be capable of great and rapid expansion. From what has already been said, it will be appreciated that it would take a considerable time, in the case of home produc-tion, to obtain the necessary extra supplies by the establishment of yet additional oil from coal plants. In the case of imported supplies, however, the possibilities of rapid expansion of output are much greater, always provided the facilities referred to in the last part of the previous paragraph are available. This is much more likely to be the case if in peace time the normal trade of the oil industry is maintained at the highest possible level. Provided this is so, it will be possible tp use refineries and tankers belonging to British interests, primarily for meeting the needs of this country, in addition to the diversion of supplies from enemy countries. This, too, the Committee are informed, is the view of the Oil Board, and their opinion is given in the following conclusions recorded in November, 1936:-&quot; (a) When everything which is practicable has been done, whether in the direction of home production of oil, use of alternative fuels, or in storage of reserves, this country will have to depend in a very large measure on imported supplies, especially for the requirements of the Service Departments. (b) Bearing this in mind, there is much to be said, from a defence point of view, for maintaining a large peace-time demand for petroleum products in order that production, refinery capacity, means of transportation (tankers), means of distribution and storage capacity may remain at their maximum.&quot;
278. Much stress has been laid, by those who advocate the encouragement of home production of oil, on the greater security which the country would obtain as compared with reliance on imported supplies. It is reasonable to assume that, so long as this country holds command of the seas, a large proportion of the tankers required for our oil. imports would escape enemy attack. Furthermore, in the transport of seaborne oil, and also in the case of storage in this country, the risks would be spread over a very large number of units, and, though losses would be inevitable, the policy of storage and replenish-ment from overseas should provide adequate security for our oil requirements.279. In the case of hydrogenation plants, on the other hand, the risks would be concentrated. The plants must of necessity be large, and would therefore provide conspicuous targets and be extremely vulnerable to air attack.(B) Man-Power.280. It is clear that the reliance on imported supplies would not entail large additional demands on man-power. On the contrary, according to infor-mation based on experience at Billingham, if hydrogenation plants were established, for example, to produce 1 million tons of motor spirit per annum, these plants would require nearly 30,000 persons for the supply of the necessary coal and the working of the plants, in addition to a considerable number in. secondary industries. (One million tons represents no more than 25 per cent, of the country&apos;s estimated requirements of motor spirit in 1940.) If these plants had to be multiplied, as they would have to be if reliance on this means of meeting emergency requirements were accepted, considerable additional demands would be made on man-power for the erection and subsequently for working the plants; apart from the veiy important question of the time which would be required for their establishment. In addition, further substantial supplies of coal would be needed. The Committee have been informed that, in order to meet other essential requirements for coal, a large increase in the number of workpeople in the mining-industry will be necessary. Accordingly, from the point of view of demand on man-power, home production is at a disadvantage compared with imported supplies.(C) Cost.281. The factor of cost can be divided into two sections, (1) the capital cost, (2) the annual cost.(1) Capital cost. As has been explained previously, the capital cost of a hydrogenation plant is high. To provide a production of one million tons of motor spirit, the total capital cost of the necessary plants would be  50 million. It has been suggested by some advocates of home production that considerable capital expenditure would be saved by the development of oil from coal plants, on the assumption that a greatly reduced storage capacity would be required. The Committee have paid careful attention to this view. It appears to them, however, that the storage capacity required, if oil were produced from home-resources, would be very little different from that which would be necessary if the same amount of spirit were imported. Modern war will probably consist of periods of intense activity followed by comparatively quiet periods. Therefore, to meet the peak demand and to give the security necessary, should the hydrogenation plants suffer from enemy action or by interruption of working-from other causes, very considerable storage arrangements, both of the necessary raw materials as well as of finished oil products, would be required, and there-would thus be very little difference in cost between the two alternatives on this-account.282. Incidentally, the Committee would point out that for a capital expenditure of  8 million, the cost of one hydrogenation plant with an output of 150,000 tons of motor spirit, 32 tankers of 11.200 tons cargo capacity, could be built, which, allowing for 5 voyages a year only, could bring to this country 1,800,000 tons, or twelve times the output of a single hydrogenation plant.283. (2) Annual cost. It has been explained above that although the suggested hydrogenation plants were erected to help ease the position in time
of war, yet, as soon as they were installed, they would have to commence produc-tion. Every gallon of motor spirit produced would result in the Exchequer losing revenue to the extent under existing conditions of the amount of the preference of 8d., or  10 per ton. In paragraph 267, it has been shown that with the most expensive class of storage, including all charges, the cost to the Exchequer would amount to 22s. a ton per annum. As the hydrogenation plants might operate in peace time for an indefinite period with the possibility that sooner or later they might play a part in a national emergency, it is clear that a very heavy loss of revenue by the Exchequer would be involved. In respect of the example chosen of a production of one million tons of motor spirit per annum, the Exchequer would lose  10 million each year. Unless the plants were self-supporting (which, on the information given in Section II, is not the case at present, even with the preference of 8d. per gallon) further annual charges would arise representing interest on capital and any deficiency which might exist between proceeds and costs of production.284. The Committee have endeavoured to carry this examination further and to find a basis of comparison of costs in time of war. It may very well happen that the price of imported motor spirit will increase by a substantial amount, and in such circumstances it is possible that motor spirit produced from coal might be obtained at a cost comparable with that of imported supplies. But, on the basis of existing information even if there were no increase above the present level in the cost of home-produced motor spirit, the average c.i.f. value of imported supplies would have to increase from the present figure of&apos; 4fd. to about Is. 4tf. per gallon before the balance in favour of imported spirit disappeared.. 285. The Committee feel, however, that it is impracticable for them to put forward any reliable data as to what would happen under war time conditions in regard to such important factors as (1) the possible movement of prices of imported motor spirit;(2) the changes in the costs of materials, wages, &amp;c, which may affect thecost of home-produced motor spirit; or (3) the position in regard to taxation.All these would be dependent on another indeterminable factor the duration of the war.286. The Committee is therefore unable to reach a definite conclusion of any value on the question of relative costs of the two alternatives in war time.287. The Committee have come to the conclusion, as the result of their examination of the various important factors, that the policy proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government of depending on imported supplies with adequate storage, is the most reliable and economical means of providing for an emergency; and they cannot recommend the reliance of the country in war time on supplies of oil from indigenous sources especially established for this purpose, unless any particular aspect of the case can be shown to be exceptional. The Committee consider that the provision of aviation spirit falls into this category.Aviation Spirit.288. The Air Ministry purchases the greater proportion of its requirements of aviation spirit according to its specification D.T.D. 230, which requires an octane number of 87. This specification is very rigid in character and, amongst other provisions, will not permit the use of cracked spirit owing to its liability to gum formation in storage which, apart from causing sticking valves, reduces octane value. Were it not for this disadvantage, the difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies would be lessened; but, in the circumstances, the world sources of supply of aviation spirit are limited, especially if the resources of the United States are excluded (owing to the possibility of the operation of the Neutrality Legislation).289. This is partly due to the fact that the requirements for this very high grade fuel in normal times are slight. It is more expensive to make, and producers are naturally not prepared to undertake a large expenditure in putting down special plant for the purpose of producing an article for which, in time of peace, there is only a small demand.
290. A further difficulty arises from the fact that not all kinds of crude petroleum are suitable for the production of an aviation spirit. The Committee have had the advantage of hearing evidence from experts on this aspect of the problem. This evidence indicated that for the production of aviation spirit by simple distillation, certain crudes, but by no means all, found in the East Indies  Borneo, Sumatra, Java and Sarawak are good. Burma crude yields what is in many ways a good spirit although rather below the required octane number. Eoumania produces one type of crude which gives a spirit of the required grade, but another class of crude from that country does not. Of the above crudes the yield of aviation spirit varies from 13 per cent, in the case of Roumania to 30 per cent, in the case of Sarawak. Certain Venezuelan crude oils might yield up to 10 per cent., others not more than 2 or 3 per cent. One or two Trinidad crudes might yield about 5 per cent. Many other oil fields, including Iran, yield no crudes which on straight distillation would produce aviation spirit.291. It is, however, possible by the blending of certain components, and by adopting special methods of intensive fractional distillation, to obtain yields of aviation spirit from crudes which do not produce a suitable spirit by straight distillation.   The process is a complicated and somewhat expensive one.292. It is estimated that the requirements of the Air Ministry in peace time will amount, on completion of the present Expansion Programme, to 87,000 tons per annum (mainly of 87 octane number); whereas it is estimated that 600,000 tons will be required at &apos;&apos; home &apos;&apos; in the first year of a European war, or about seven times the peace time needs. In addition, a further 70,000 tons of aviation spirit will be needed east of Suez. It must be assumed also that in the event of a European war, the demand for aviation spirit by other Powers will be very great. Even if our enemies can be prevented! from obtaining these special fuels, owing to our command of the seas, the needs of our allies will have to be met to a large extent from the same sources on which this country would have to rely.293. Investigations so far made indicate that it should be possible for this country to obtain the following quantities from the sources indicated:  Tons.Dutch East Indies............      150,000Burma        ...............        83,000Venezuela   ...............      100,000Colombia and Peru        .........        25,000Trinidad     ...      .....&apos;.      ......      150,000Total      ............      508,000This quantity falls a good deal short of the total requirements indicated above.294. 100 octane aviation spirit.-During the past year or two an aviation spirit with an octane number of 100 has been produced, mainly in the United States. The Air Ministry are at the present time using certain quantities of this spirit for full scale flying tests. By its use an improved engine performance can be obtained, a tactical advantage which, the Committee realise, this country might not be able to disregard. There are several possible methods of producing a spirit of this standard, but at the moment the most suitable appears to be by mixing a large proportion of iso-octane with a good quality spirit which, with.the addition of tetraethyl lead, will give the 100 octane rating required.295. Iso-octane is a product of petroleum refinery gases, and the only considerable source of supply is in the United States. Already arrangements have been made by the Air Ministry with certain of the oil companies to instal one plant in each of the following: Great Britain, Trinidad, Iran and the Dutch West Indies, the production from which should together be capable of making available a supply of about 120,000 tons per annum of 100 octane fuel.296. It is alse possible to make a somewhat similar product in connexion with the hydrogenation process which will, when mixed with the high grade spirit obtainable in a hydrogenation plant, produce a fuel of 95 octane number.
The Air Ministry are carrying out tests on this fuel and have made arrangements with Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., for a pilot plant to produce a limited quantity. It is likely to be two or three years before the quantities of 100 octane fuel, referred to in the previous paragraph, can be produced, but as tJhey become available they will help to meet the deficiency in the supplies of aviation spirit referred to in paragraph 293, because the manufacture of this type of fuel does not affect the production of 87 octane spirit.297. Nevertheless, the trend of the Royal Air Force to require an increasing standard of quality in its aviation fuel only serves to emphasise the importance of exploring all possible means of meeting its requirements.Supplies from home refineries.298. The Committee have been informed that the Oil Board have already considered the possibility of arranging for the establishment in this country of a special refinery which, in an emergency, would be used for the treatment of reserves of suitable crude oils, the storage of which would be undertaken in peace time. The Oil Board are, however, of opinion that this method, for several reasons, is not attractive.299. The Committee also took evidence on the question of the desirability of encouraging home refining generally in this country, particularly as a means of providing raw materials for the manufacture of iso-octane. But they are satisfied that the objections outweigh any possible advantages.300.   Among the outstanding disadvantages, are: (1) Refineries would offer considerable targets for hostile aircraft.(2) In the operation of refining there is an appreciable loss of the crude oil. A larger amount of tanker tonnage would therefore be required to enable the necessary volume of crude oil to be transported to this country for refining here, as compared with the amount of tonnage necessary for the transport of an equivalent quantity of refined products. Such an increased demand on tanker tonnage would not be desirable at a time when all available tonnage should be used to the best advantage; while the importation of crude and subsequent refining would necessitate additional handling and transport in this country.(3) It might not be practicable to ensure that at a given time the output of refined products from the crude oil available, would correspond to the particular needs of the country; and if there were any interruption in the supply of the classes of crude oils for the treatment of which the refineries were designed, there would be serious delay in carrying out the necessary adjustments to deal with crudes from other sources.Hydrogenation as a Source of Supply.301. In view of the uncertainty which exists in regard to supplies of aviation spirit, the Committee have carefully considered whether a contribution of a substantial nature could not be made from home resources.302. Reference has already been made to the fact that an aviation spirit to comply with specification D.T.D. 230 can be produced by the hydrogenation process, and that substantial supplies of a 95 octane spirit could also be made available.303. In the Section on the hydrogenation process, it is explained that this is divided into two systems : the liquid phase and the vapour phase, and for the treatment of coal both are necessary. The vapour phase system is more efficient than the liquid phase, but if the former is used alone, only a liquid raw material can be employed.   Such a raw material, creosote, is being used at Billingham.304. The Committee are of opinion that the establishment of a plant to hydrogenate creosote would be of assistance in furnishing a supply of aviation spirit.
o305. Creosote, as has been explained, is one of the products of the carbonisation industry, and the Table in paragraph 95 gives the production of this commodity. As will be seen, a considerable quantity of creosote is exported, while a further quantity is left in the tar which is used on the roads.306. If, in a state of war, the export of creosote were stopped (as is contemplated) and arrangements were made to extract by distillation a proportion only of the creosote before the tar was used for road purposes, a large increase in the quantity of this important product would become available. In addition to this, the amount now taken by Billingham for hydrogenation would probably be released, as owing to the exposed position of the Billingham plant, very little reliance can be placed on its operating in case of hostilities. By the means suggested, there should be no serious difficulty in making available 200,000 tons of creosote.307. The Committee therefore suggest that this creosote should be hydrogenated in a vapour phase plant or plants which, from the quantity of creosote mentioned, could produce about 140,000 tons of 87 octane aviation spirit.308. The Committee discussed such a possibility with Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., and asked the Company whether it would be practicable to submit a scheme. This the Company agreed to do, and details are given in Appendix No. IV, paragraphs 37 to 61.309. The Company state that it would be possible to erect such a plant and maintain it in peace time in working order, and only to operate it in time of war when sufficient supplies of creosote could be made available. If this were done, the figures given below show that there would be a substantial saving to the Exchequer compared with the loss of revenue which would be involved if the plant functioned in peace time.310.   The cost of the plant is estimated to be  3-8 million, provided services power and make-up gas from coke ovens are available without the expen-diture of capital beyond that required to link up supplies to the plant.311. Taking interest on capital at 4 per cent. the Government can at present raise money at a somewhat more favourable rate with depreciation at 5 per cent., and alternatively, depreciation and obsolescence at 10 per cent., the annual cost would be : - .Maintenance   ... Depreciation at 5 per cent.   ... Depreciation and obsolescence at 10 per cent. Interest on  3-8 million at 4 per cent.   ... 	 25,000	25,000190,000		380,000152,000	152,000367,000	557,000If the same amount of spirit, i.e., 140,000 tons,  were produced  from  a plantoperating in peace time, the loss of .        ;revenue at 8d. per gallon would be ...  1,400,000312. If, for reasons of greater security and in order to economise transport, it were desired to establish, say, three plants with a combined production of 140,000 tons, the cost would be appreciably increased. Particulars are given in Appendix No. IV, paragraph 54.313. While the Committee recognise that such a scheme would be more costly than storage, it appears to them very important to have at home a source of supply of a substantial size to help to secure the required quantity of aviation spirit. As the Appendix indicates, a plant of this type could, if necessary, be used to supply a smaller quantity of .95 octane fuel or other special fuels. The plant, or plants, would have to be built in some part of the country which was considered reasonably safe. The erection of the plant or plants would probably take at least two years to complete.
. 314. The proposal to establish a creosote hydrogenation plant would make little further demand on man-power, as the men required would only consist of those necessary to operate the plant. If the Billingham plant is not to be regarded as available for working, the trained staff employed there could be trans-ferred to the new plant. The supply of creosote coming from existing sources of supply would also make no extra call on the nation&apos;s man-power.Necessity for assuring further sources of supply.315. The Committee have hesitated to make any further definite proposal for the erection of hydrogenation plants, largely because, on the evidence given to them by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., they feel that further time is required to enable the Company to secure the full benefit of the experience gained in the work at Billingham.316. Having, however, examined in some detail the position in regard to supplies of aviation spirit, a matter of vital importance in time of war, the Committee feel bound to put on record their view that the situation does not at present appear to them to be satisfactory, even in regard to supplies of 87 octane spirit, and still less in regard to 100 octane fuel. It would seem to the Committee that there are possibilities in regard to the hydrogenation process which should be closely watched and that every encouragement should be given to Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., to expedite the work they are doing in this direction.317. The Committee understand that the Air Ministry are already investigating all likely sources of production in the various oilfields of the world, with a view to seeing whether there are any possible means of augmenting the supply of these special fuels. One witness, representing an important British oil company, suggested that it would be an advantage if there were a somewhat closer co-operation between the Air Ministry and the oil companies in regard to this matter.318. The Committee also feel that further consideration ought to be given to the possibility of making fuller use of cracked spirit in an emergency. If the spirit were consumed within a reasonably short period, as it could be in time of war, the difficulty in regard to gum formation should not be so serious a factor as when the spirit is stored for long periods, as must be the case in normal times-Some special precautions might have to be taken to ensure prompt usage, but this should not present insuperable difficulties. It would also seem desirable to. conduct further research with a view, if possible, to the prevention of the deterioration of the spirit and the formation of gum.319. In the preparation of 87 octane spirit it is usual to start with a spirit having an octane number of not less than 73, which by the addition of not more than 4 cc&apos;s of tetraethyl lead can be built up to 87 octane number. If it were possible, for example, by the use of special octane fuels such as iso-octane or ketones, or the use of rather larger quantities of tetraethyl lead to start with a spirit of somewhat lower octane than 73, it would widen the sources of supply, and the Committee suggest that these possibilities should be investigated.320. If, as a result of the investigations referred to in the three previous paragraphs, supplies of aviation spirit are still short of requirements, then the Committee recommend that consideration should be given to the establishment of a new coal hydrogenation plant, to operate in peace time for the production of motor spirit, and to be available in an emergency for the production of aviation fuel.Benzole and Toluol.321. There is one other direction in which oil produced from home materials can assist in a national emergency. This is in the provision of benzole produced from coke ovens and gas works, which is a very important source for the supply of the toluol required for the manufacture of high explosives. The Committee have been informed that the amount of toluol estimated to be required in an -emergency for this purpose is 30-35,000 tons per annum.
322. To obtain this quantity, 75-80 million gallons of crude benzole would be necessary. The summary of the annual war time requirements of benzole for various purposes supplied to the Committee is as follows : Million Gallons of Crude Benzole.(1) Air Ministry.................        7(2) Civil Aviation.................. \Benzole required to produce toluol (1) lor explosives   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      75(2) Dyeing and chemicals industries     ...      ...      ...        9: 91*323. It will, therefore, be seen that, whilst the requirements of crude benzole are 91* million gallons, some 84 million gallons only were produced in 1936, leaving a deficiency of 7* million gallons.324. Doubtless it would be possible, as was done during the last War, to make arrangements on the outbreak of an emergency to stimulate the production of benzole by requiring those works which do not now recover it to take steps to do so. But the Committee feel that there is a considerable advantage in having-as large a production as possible in peace-time, and they recommend, therefore, that consideration should be given now to the steps which would be necessary to achieve this result. They consider that if their recommendation in regard to the continuance of a guaranteed preference is accepted, it will go a long way to secure what is desired. The benzole will still be suitable for use as a motor spirit after the toluol has been extracted.325. In order that supplies of benzole (and creosote) may be made available it is important that supplies of coal and their transport to gas works should be assured in an emergency. The Committee understand that this question is already under review by another Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.326. Except, therefore, in regard to the particular instances referred to, of aviation spirit and benzole for the production of toluol, the Committee are of the opinion that home-produced oil is not likely in the near future to be able to make a material contribution to the country&apos;s needs in time of war.Section V.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.A.-CONCLUSIONS. Section I. Natural Oil Supplies.(1) All the important countries of the world, except U.S.A. and Russia,, have to import a large proportion of their requirements of petroleum products. The United Kingdom, however, has certain definite advantages over other-importing countries, inasmuch as British oil companies have taken a large share in the development,of the oil industry of the world, have acquired concessions over large sources of supply and own considerable refinery capacity. They control a very large tanker fleet and have a world-wide distributing organisation (paragraphs 23-25).(2) The modern requirements for oil necessitate the provision of a wide-variety of products, and the oil industry has been able to meet efficiently the-
greatly increased demands which have grown up during the present century, including those of the modern high-speed, high-compression motor engine for a motor spirit of good anti-knock quality, and of the diesel engine for a light gas oil, or diesel oil of good ignition quality (paragraphs 26-38).(3) There seems to be little likelihood of the demand for oil outstripping the supply in the near future to such an extent as to bring about a substantial rise in prices of oil products (paragraphs 40-42).Section II. Production of Oil from. Home Sources.A. Natural Petroleum and Shale Oil.(4) Under the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1934, substantial progress in drilling has been made in this country, but no success has so far been reported (paragraphs 48-53).(5) The other natural source of supply, the Scottish shale oil industry, has existed for many years, but has passed through several critical stages owing to the competition of imported petroleum products. The industry has adopted modern methods of operation and is being efficiently run. It claims that, should the preference be maintained, it will be able to increase considerably its produc-tion. If, however, the preference is withdrawn, it will again be in a parlous condition. The motor spirit from shale is not suitable as an aviation spirit, but the industry would, in times of emergency, be of assistance in meeting the demand for fuel for heavy road transport. Although the contribution to the national oil supply is not large, the industry should be encouraged (paragraphs 54-67).B. The Carbonisation Industries.(i) and (ii) Gas and Coke Oven Industries.(6) The gas and the coke oven industries are sources of supply of benzole and creosote. The production of oil products, however, is governed by the demand for the principal products of manufacture, namely, gas and metallurgical coke, respectively. In practice, maximum production of oil products is not available in normal times, mainly because, in the: case of gas works, only the larger undertakings &apos;&apos; strip &apos;&apos; their gas of benzole. At the smaller undertakings the cost of installing the necessary plant is a serious consideration. During 1936, 51 million gallons of motor spirit were supplied by these industries, and there is a further potential supply available, which, at the present practical limit of production, might amount to about 20 million gallons of motor spirit per annum (paragraphs 76-91).(7) The quantity of creosote produced in 1936 was 90 million gallons (410,000 tons). If all the tar had been distilled the total would be increased to about 146 million gallons (660,000 tons) (paragraphs 93-95).(iii) Low Temperature Carbonisation.(8) The main product of the low temperature carbonisation industry is a smokeless semi-coke which is suitable for burning in domestic grates. Numerous companies formed for exploiting the claims of inventors have experienced technical and other difficulties in proceeding from the laboratory scale to full-sized plants. The Fuel Research Station is authorised to report on technical aspects of semi-commercial scale plants, but these reports could be made of more value if they dealt with all technical points connected with the operation of the process (paragraphs 100-106).(9) There are small variations in the yields of products by different processes, but no single process could be given special consideration on account of the quantity of oil products obtained (paragraph 114).(10) The commercial success of the low temperature carbonisation industry is dependent on disposing of the coke. At present it finds ready sale, but there can be no assurance that there will be a really large market for such a highly priced fuel (paragraphs 118-119).
(11) About 10 per cent, more coal would be required to give the equivalent amount of fuel and heat value, but representatives of the coal industry were doubtful whether any advantage would accrue to their industry by replacing household coal by low temperature coke on a large scale (paragraphs 122-123).(12) The practical difficulties of securing any large development within a reasonable period are so great that they preclude any serious account being taken of such a possibility. Accordingly low temperature carbonisation must be ignored as a possible substantial source of oil supply. The industry benefits from the preferences granted on home-produced oil products, and to the extent that it develops on normal lines it will, like the other carbonisation industries, make a contribution to the problem of smoke abatement, efficient fuel utilisation, and provide some addition to the country&apos;s supplies of oil (paragraphs 124-128).C. Hydrogenation: Fischer and similar synthetic processes.(i) Hydrogenation.(13) The successful development of hydrogenation, which is primarily suitable for the production of motor spirit but is also capable of yielding high octane petrol and aviation spirit, would provide an entirely new field for coal. The plant at Billingham is virtually in full operation, but a number of difficulties have arisen in the treatment of coal, and the yield of petrol per ton of coal processed has not reached that originally anticipated. It is confidently expected that most of these difficulties could be overcome in a new plant. The lower yield has had an important effect on costs of production. Creosote and low temperature tar can be hydrogenated in the vapour phase system of the plant with considerably higher percentage yields than are obtained from coal. There is a considerable range of coals in this country suitable for the process (paragraphs 129-147).(14) The capital cost of Billingham was about  7 million, and the overall cost per gallon of petrol produced after allowing for a commercial yield on capital of 7 per cent, is 14-78cZ. if 5 per cent, is allowed for depreciation, or 16-90c?. if 10 per cent, is allowed for depreciation and obsolescence. The realised price in 1936 was 12-20c?. per gallon. For a new plant to give 150,000 tons of petrol per annum the smallest economic unit. the present estimated capital cost would be  8 million; and the overall cost on the same basis as indicated for the existing plant would be 12-32c?. and 14-46c?. respectively. The average realised price would probably be 12-00c?. per gallon (paragraphs 149-160).(15) Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., have given the Committee the reasons why under the present conditions they would not extend their commitments; they have also suggested the lines upon which they would be prepared to help to build a plant, and the conditions which would be necessary if it were considered that development should be left to commercial interests (paragraphs 161-167).(ii) Fischer Process.(16) There has been no practical experience in the working of this process, in this country, and facilities for a proper technical investigation of the process in Germany are only accorded to those willing to pay a substantial fee as a first step in acquiring a licence a step which no concern in this country has so far taken. There are indications that there is some divergence of views on important points among witnesses who have contemplated the establishment of this process-in this country (paragraphs 170--177).(17) The first semi-commercial scale plant in Germany did not begin operation until August, 1936, and the evidence given to the Committee shows-that finality has&quot; pot yet been reached in the working out of the process; nor have its possibilities yet been detennined. In these circumstances, it has been difficult to deal in detail with the capital costs, costs of production and realisation prices, but it was clear that, as in the case of hydrogenation, a considerable-measure of Government assistance would be required before any commercial
undertaking would contemplate large-scale development. The suggestion most favoured was a guaranteed preference of not less than 8d. per gallon for at least 12 years, on which basis there were indications that private enterprise might be prepared to erect a plant (paragraphs 179-195).(18) While reliable data were unobtainable, the Committee consider that there are certain features of the process which merit close investigation, more particularly the possibility of producing diesel and lubricating oils, and this could be carried out on a commercial scale plant of, say, 20,000 tons per annum of primary products (paragraph 196).(iii) Robinson Bindley Process.(19) This process in its main features is closely allied to the Fischer process, but it is claimed that it differs in certain important respects. A semi-commercial plant is being erected in Scotland to produce about 200 tons of motor spirit per annum. At present the data are insufficient on which to assess the value of this process (paragraphs 197-203).Section III. Economic Aspect of Home Production of Oil.Competition with Imported Oil.(20) The wide publicity which has been given to the possibility of producing oil from coal has given rise in many quarters to a demand for the active develop-ment of the industry. But the step from technical achievement to economic success may be a long one, and this is not sufficiently appreciated. In view of the wide margin between the relative costs of imported oil and oil produced from indigenous materials, the Committee feel that any development of the oil from coal industry should be concentrated, not on the production of oil products which are freely available at very low prices, e.g., fuel oil, but on those products which are more costly and less readily obtainable (paragraphs 204-206).(21) The Committee cannot see the possibility of any early substantial advance in the world price of natural petroleum products. There is, therefore, no immediate possibility of the development of the oil from coal industry on the basis of free competition with imported oil products. If it is desirable for other reasons to produce oil from indigenous products, Government assistance will be necessary (paragraphs 207-209).A assistance hitherto afforded by Government.(22) The preference guaranteed to home-produced oil by the British Hydrocarbon Oils Production Act, 1934, will, if the preference actually given is maintained at the present rate of 8d. per gallon, expire in September, 1939, and it will in the near future be necessary for the Government to review its policy. The guarantee of a preference resulted directly in the erection by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., of a large-scale plant for the hydrogenation of coal. This, however, has not yet been long enough in operation to afford conclusive evidence of its possibilities. The Committee are informed that any further development by the Company on similar lines is, in present conditions, out of the question. The guaranteed preference has also resulted in an increase in the home production of motor spirit by the carbonisation industries; and, together with the import duties on heavy oils, have also virtually saved the shale oil industry from extinc-tion. The extra revenue on motor spirit which the Exchequer would have received, had the whole of the home-produced spirit been replaced by imported spirit, would have amounted to over  5 million for the period between the 1st April, 1935, the effective date of operation of the 1934 Act, to the end of 1936. Thus, from the Exchequer point of view oil from coal processes have been encouraged to a very considerable extent (paragraphs 210-216).Employment Aspect.(23) The Committee have given careful consideration to the employment aspect of the production of oil from indigenous materials. The shale oil industry of Scotland, which owes its survival entirely to the preferences referred to, emplovs [16154] &apos; h
about 4,300 men and, if the preference were continued at the present rate for a sufficient time, that figure might be doubled (paragraphs 218-220).(24) In the gas and coke oven industries the possibilities of additional employment being afforded are small (paragraph 221).(25) The Committee is satisfied that no great increase in employment in the coal industry would result even from a very large expansion in the low temperature carbonisation industry, while the financial position of the coal industry might be adversely affected (paragraphs 222-225).(26) The hydrogenation and synthetic processes, the main products of which are oil, present an entirely new outlet for coal, and offer the greatest opportunity for increased employment in the mining industry. From information supplied to the Committee, it is evident that the capital cost of any new employment provided by the development of hydrogenation would be very high. The loss to the Exchequer would be equivalent to a continuing assistance amounting to about  5 per week per person employed. Though no precise estimates are available as regards the employment value of the synthetic processes, the Committee have reason to believe that much the same considerations apply. Thus, purely from the point of view of the cost of providing new employment these processes are not very hopeful (paragraphs 226-229).Value of Technical and Industrial development.(27) The value of further technical and industrial developments of oil from coal processes must not, however, be overlooked. The real possibilities of these processes cannot be properly assessed without further research and development on a commercial scale. Moreover, the country cannot afford to lag behind other countries in exploiting the benefits to be derived from developing the home production of oil, with the possibility at the same time of providing a new source of raw materials for the chemical industry; not the least of these benefits being the valuable training of personnel in those industries. The Committee feel, there-fore, that the work which has been begun should be carried on on a sufficient scale to provide technical and economic data which could be used to determine the possibilities of further large scale development (paragraphs 230-236).Form of further assistance.(28) In order to provide this the Committee are of the opinion that the present form of assistance, viz., the guaranteed preference for a number of years, should be continued, that the guaranteed rate should be higher than hitherto and the guaranteed period longer (paragraphs 240-244).Effect of further assistance.(29) If this recommendation is accepted by the Government the Committee are hopeful that certain commercial interests might be prepared to erect a plant operating the Fischer process of sufficient size to give reliable commercial data. There would then be in existence in this country as a minimum one large commercial scale plant of each of the processes designed primarily to produce oil from coal. If this step fails to achieve the desired results then it would only be reasonable to conclude that these processes are at present so far removed from economic success that any other form of assistance would not be justified (paragraph 245).(30) Unless assistance is continued, the production of oil from coal by the carbonisation industries would probably decline, and the fullest possible recovery of by-products from coal would not be obtained. The shale oil industry would again lapse- into a serious condition (paragraph 246).Effect on Exchequer Revenues.(31) The Committee, in advocating this long term policy which they believe in the circumstances to be the correct one, have also considered the possibility, should the price of imported oils rise, or home production increase substantially, of safeguarding the Exchequer revenues, and have made suggestions in this
respect. On the other hand, there are certain factors which might lessen the effectiveness of the proposed preference, but in the Committee&apos;s view this is a risk which those undertaking further development must be prepared to face (paragraphs 247-256).Availability of Preference for all processes. ;(32) The idea of limiting the proposed new rate of guaranteed preference to certain new plants was rejected by the Committee on the grounds that it would involve discrimination between processes and might hamper work in the earlier stages of new processes. The Committee are satisfied that there is considerable advantage in preserving a uniform basis of preference for all processes for producing oil from indigenous materials (paragraph 253).Section IV. The position in Time of War. National Needs. ;(33) Allowing for the application of rationing in this country the total estimated home consumption in 1940, in the event of war, will be about 16f million tons of oil products. This represents a very large increase over normal require-ments due mainly to the needs of the Navy and the Royal Air Force (paragraphs 261-263).Acquisition of reserve stocks.(34) Already steps are being taken to build up reserves for the Service Departments and the question of similar measures being taken in regard to civil stocks is under consideration. Allowing for drawing on these reserves the new supplies required in the first year of a major war will be about 13\ million tons (paragraphs 264-268).Imported Stcpplies.(35) Except in regard to aviation spirit the Oil Board do not anticipate any insuperable difficulty in securing the necessary supplies from overseas (para-graphs 269-270).Home production compared tvith imported supplies.(36) The only potential sources of great expansion of home production are the hydrogenation and the Fischer or similar process. Owing to present uncertainty of the value to this country of the latter, the former offers the only possible hope at the moment, and this under existing conditions is limited to the production of light oils (paragraphs 272-273).(37) Home production at present amounts to about 7 per cent, of the normal motor spirit consumption. Negligible quantities of other oil products are made. To furnish even a relatively minor contribution a very large expansion of home production would be necessary. To the extent that this were secured it would ultimately result in a reduction of the facilities which exist in the oil industry (paragraphs 275-276).(38) Whatever sources of supply are normally used they must be capable of rapid expansion to meet war-time needs. This in the view of the Oil Board is more likely to be accomplished through the world-wide organisation of the oil industry than by home production (paragraph 277).(39) Having compared the alternatives of overseas supplies and home production in relation to a contribution by the latter representing, say, 25 per cent, of the country&apos;s requirements of motor spirit on the basis of (a) assurance of supplies, (6) effect on man-power, and (c) relative cost; the Committee are forced to the conclusion that they cannot recommend reliance on home production save in the exceptional case of aviation spirit (paragraphs 274-287).
Aviation Spirit.(40) In regard to aviation spirit, which is a vital requirement in war-time, the supply position, in regard to&apos; 87 octane spirit is not satisfactory as the world sources of production of this grade of spirit are at present limited. The Royal Air Force is now turning attention to the use of 100 octane fuel, supplies of which are even more difficult to obtain. The hydrogenation process offers possibilities of providing supplies of these high octane fuels (paragraphs 288-296).Supplies from home refineries.(41) The possibility of meeting some part of the requirements of aviation spirit from home refining has been considered, but the Committee conclude that the objections outweigh the possible advantages (paragraphs 298-300).Hydrogenation plant to treat creosote.(42) By the hydrogenation of creosote substantial supplies of 87 octane aviation spirit could be obtained as an emergency measure. This could be pro-duced in a plant using the vapour phase system only. As the necessary addi-tional supplies of creosote are not available for this purpose in peace time, the plant would have to be built now and maintained for operation in war time only. Particulars are given of the cost of such a plant and of the means proposed to make available the necessary quantities of creosote (paragraphs 301-314).Necessity for assuring further sources of supply.(43) The work which Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., are carrying out on aviation fuels should be encouraged; and the investigations at present being made into the possibility of obtaining further supplies of aviation spirit from overseas should be continued in close co-operation with the oil companies. It would also seem desirable to review the question of making use of cracked spirit; and to investigate the possibilities of using iso-octane or ketones, or a somewhat larger amount of tetraethyl lead to enable spirits not at present suitable for making 87 octane fuel to be used for that purpose (paragraphs 316-319).(44) If as a result of these investigations supplies of aviation spirit are still short of requirements, consideration should be given to the establishment of a new coal hydrogenation plant (paragraph 320).Benzole and toluol.(45) One other direction in which oil from coal can assist in a national emergency is in the production of benzole which, besides providing motor fuel, is an important source of supply of toluol required for the manufacture of explosives (paragraphs 321-324).(46) Apart from the production of aviation spirit and benzole, the Committee are of opinion that home-produced oil is not likely in the near future to be able to make a material contribution to .the country&apos;s needs in. time of war (paragraph 326).B. RECOMMENDATIONS.I. Extension for further Period of Guaranteed Preference.It is quite evident to the Committee that if there is to be further development of the production of- oil from coal on any important scale, or, indeed, if the production of even the existing amount of oil products from home resources is to be maintained, a continuance of a guaranteed preference on home-produced spirit is essential. In existing-circumstances the Committee have expressed the view&apos; that the amount of the preference necessary is not less than 8c?. a gallon, which is the present rate of preference now given, but double the amount of the guaranteed preference.
The  Committee,  therefore,  strongly recommend  the continuance of  a.fuaranteed preference for a period of 12 years from 1938, the rate being increased rom &amp;d. to 8d. per gallon, and the guarantee extended to include diesel oil for use in motor vehicles.The Committee have considered whether it is practicable to suggest any measures which might be taken to safeguard the Exchequer against (a) a declining revenue from the duty on imported oils; and (&amp;) an excessive preference to the home-producing oil industry.It appears to the Committee that it should be practicable to meet these contingencies and in paragraphs 248 to 256 they have made suggestions as to the manner in which they consider such safeguards might be provided.II. The Gas and Coke Oven Industries.. The Committee consider that there are two matters affecting these two industries, viz., the further production of benzole and the production, storage and transport of creosote during a national emergency, which should be fully investigated prior to an emergency.They therefore recommend that the Government should consider the setting up of a National Emergency Committee composed of representatives of the Gas and Coke Oven industries, Tar Distillers and representatives of the Govern-ment Departments concerned to consider (1) The steps necessary to encourage the greater production of benzole bygas works and coke ovens, particularly the former. (2) Making available to small undertakings of technical advice as to theproduction and disposal of benzole. (3) The effect of any measures taken to reduce calorific value in war time on the requirements of gas consumers. (4) The steps which might be necessary to secure that creosote at presentleft in road tar may be made available. (5) Arrangements for storing and transporting large quantities of creosotewhich may have to be diverted from existing uses.III. Low Temperature Carbonisation.(1) The Committee recommend that assistance to this industry should be limited to participation in the benefits to be derived from the guaranteed preference on home-produced oils. It will thus be afforded the same assistance as the other carbonisation industries. The Committee consider that the grant of direct financial assistance for the establishment of plants cannot be justified.(2) The Committee consider that the facilities provided by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for carrying out, free of charge, an official test of low temperature carbonisation plants should be continued; but that the tests and the reports thereon should cover all technical points connected with the operation of, and the products of the process, and not merely with the carbonisation aspect.IY. Hydrogenation.The Committee recommend the establishment of a hydrogenation plant to operate on creosote only, with a capacity to produce 140,000 tons of aviation spirit per annum. If for reasons of security it were considered undesirable to have one plant only, three plants with a total capacity of 140,000 tons could be provided. The plant or plants to be established in a district or districts which may be regarded as relatively secure from enemy attack, and to operate only in a national emergency, and kept in normal times under the charge of a care and maintenance staff. The Committee suggest that the plant or plants should be erected under an agency arrangement by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., who should be responsible for their maintenance, and when necessary, for their operation. Particulars of the capital and maintenance costs of this proposal are given in paragraphs 310 to 312.
Y. Synthetic Processes. . ,The Committee consider that it would be of considerable advantage if the establishment of a plant to work the Fischer process, and designed for the?roduction of 20-30,000 tons of primary products per annum could be secured. hey hope that, with the extension of the guaranteed preference, one or more industrial concerns may be induced to undertake the erection of such a plant. But if financial assistance is requested from the Government, the Committee recommend that such assistance should be limited to sums required for special items of research work which, by agreement with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, can be recommended as being of national interest. ,&apos;YI. Scottish Shale Oil Industry.This is a small, though important, industry. The recommendation of the Committee for a continuance of the guaranteed preference under I above should be of great assistance in encouraging its development.YII. Aviation Spirit.In addition to the proposal under &apos;&apos; Hydrogenation &apos;&apos; above, the Committee recommend that (1) The investigations which are being made into the possibility of securing further sources of production of this spirit in the different oil fields of the world should be actively pursued in close co-operation with the oil companies.(2) The work which Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., are carrying out on the production of aviation fuels should be closely watched and encouraged.(3) The question of the use of cracked spirit should be reviewed.(4) The possibilities of using iso-octane or ketones, or a larger quantity of tetraethyl lead, so as to enable spirits not at present suitable for making 87 octane fuel, to be used for that purpose, should be investigated.(5) If, as a result of these measures, supplies of aviation fuels are still short of requirements, consideration should then be given to the establish-ment of a further coal hydrogenation plant.YIII. 100 Octane Aviation Fuel.As the supplies of this fuel are at present very limited, the Committee recommend that close consideration should be given to all possible means of securing larger quantities of this class of spirit.The Committee wish to place on record their appreciation of the services rendered by their Joint Secretaries, Mr. Starling and Commander Nichoil, by Mr. Lyons, who has assisted the Secretaries, and by all those who have been concerned with the typing and printing of the Report.FALMOUTH (Chairman). .

APPENDIX II.The Scottish Shale Oil Industry.(A) Summary of Memorandum submitted, to the Committee in July, 1937, by Mr. Fraser, Deputy Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ltd., and, Managing Director of Scottish Oils, Ltd.Historical.1. In 1850, the mineral oil industry was founded in Scotland, when works were brought into operation near Bathgate, Linlithgowshire. In this district occurred a particular type of cannel coal, known as Boghead Coal or Torbanehill Mineral. On distillation, this yielded a crude oil similar to naturally occurring petroleum, which was not then known to exist in quantity. The object of the industry was the production of oils for lighting and lubrication to augment the supplies of animal and vegetable oils, which were proving inadequate to demand and not entirely suitable for the changing conditions. The first products to be marketed were naphtha for use as a solvent and illuminating oil, followed by lubricants and paraffin wax.2. The only source of Boghead Coal was one thin seam, and prior to 1850, this coal was in considerable demand for gas-making. Later, it was mined for use in oil works in Scotland, on the Continent and in the United States, and some time after 1860 the resources were practically exhausted.3. In 1858, an oil shale yielding similar products was discovered near Broxburn, and later, in the West Calder district. The maximum yield of oil from this shale was 50 gallons per ton, as compared with 120 gallons from the Boghead Coal, but owing to its abundance and low price, the industry was able to expand at a much quicker rate.4. In 1865, 120 works were in operation in Scotland, using the oil shale of the Lothians or cannel coal and cannel shale from the Coal Measures. Many of these works were situated at collieries where this coal or shale happened to be available, and in some cases the manufacture of oil was carried on only inter-mittently when markets were favourable. Most of these operations were&apos; eventually abandoned owing to the inferiority of the product and the limited size of the individual works.5. The commercial development of oil in the United States, which began in 1859, caused a rapid fall in prices and resulted in the closing of many of the Scottish oil works. Those that survived did so by reason of the close attention paid to technical and commercial matters, and despite the unequal competition with the natural product, the output in Scotland continued to expand, as shown in the table below. This was due to increased efficiency of plant and methods, particularly in the retorting and refining departments.6. The following table shows the annual output of shale in Scotland for certain years from 1875 : Tons.3,117,658 3,080,317 2,840,859 2,464,829 2,020,510 1,732,746 1,368,596 1,396,988 1,400,775 1,408,371 1,407,423i 2Year.

7. More than a dozen seams of shale have been worked, and each has characteristics of its own as regards yields of crude oil and sulphate of ammonia, and the quantity and nature of the finished products obtainable from the crude oil. For instance, the yield has varied from 50 gallons of crude oil and 20 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia per ton-of shale to about 18 gallons of crude oil and 60 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia. At the present time, the average yield of crude oil, including crude or scrubber naptha, is about 22 gallons per ton, with about 38 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia.8. It is extremely difficult to make a reliable estimate of the quantity of shale available, owing to the variations in quality and thickness of seams from place to place. Economic factors also control the quantity it is practicable to work at any given time. An estimate published in 1918 by H.M. Geological Survey and based on economic conditions existing during the ten years preceding 1914, arrived at a probable reserve of 482 million tons in the counties Of Mid Lothian, West Lothian, Lanark and Peebles. Since this estimate was made, however, exploration has proved certain areas to be barren, while the change in economic conditions has completely altered the economic basis of the figures. Thus there is a very much smaller reserve than was thought to exist, although enough amply to justify development under suitable economic conditions.Method of Operation.9. The methods employed in mining shale differ only in detail from those for coal. After the shale has been brought to the surface, it is passed between rollers, in order to reduce it to a size most suitable for retorting. The shale is fed continuously into the retort by a hopper at the top, and passes down vertical tubes by gravity through zones of rising temperature, and is finally discharged mechanically at the bottom, having then parted with its valuable constituents.10. Several designs of retort have been employed from time to time, as it is the method of retorting which determines to a large extent the yield and quality of the products.11. In the retorting process, the organic matter contained in the shale is converted into new forms which pass off as vapour, the greater part of which is condensed into crude oil and ammonia water by atmospheric cooling; the lighter portion is recovered by :&apos; scrubbing &apos;&apos; with a spray of oil (yielding scrubber naphtha); a further quantity of ammonia is abstracted by &quot;scrubbing&quot; with water, and the permanent gas which has passed these treatments is used as fuel.12. About 20 per cent, by weight of the shale is converted into oil products, &amp;c., the remaining 80 per cent, of exhausted or spent shale (which is approximately of the same bulk as the original shale) being discharged from the bottom of the retort. Until recently, no economic use had been found for the spent shale, and great quantities have accumulated. But during the last few years a process has been developed for converting it into building bricks, which is proving successful.13. By the method of retorting which is at present in use, the throughput of shale is about 4 tons per retort per day. Recently a new method of retorting has been evolved and is now under large-scale trial. This method indicates the possibility of making a substantial increase in the rate of throughput.14.   If present indications are realised, the effects will be : (1) to permit an increased output of shale and production of oil(subject to the continuation of the preference and presentmarket conditions); (2) to render economically available, shale too poor to be workable atthe present time; and (3) to reduce costs.(The question of mining developments to provide additional quantities of shale is already under consideration.)Disposal of Products.15. During the War, a scheme of joint marketing of certain products was brought into operation, and at the conclusion of the War, this was extended to
deal with all products. At the same time, the six companies which were then operating were brought under one management, their ordinary shares being acquired by a new company, Scottish Oils, Ltd., whose Ordinary Shares were in turn held by Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd. (now Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ltd.). Since then, the whole capital of the operating companies and of Scottish Oils, Ltd., has been acquired by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ltd.16. Substantial economies in operating and improved efficiency in manage-ment resulted from the concentration of the operating companies under Scottish Oils, Ltd., enabling the industry to deal with the economic difficulties which then existed, as well as those of subsequent years, in a manner that would otherwise have been impossible. For instance, at one period when five separate refineries were in existence, it was found that the entire production of crude oil could be dealt with in four, leaving the fifth free for other purposes. Sources of supply of shale to the various retorting plants were also rearranged, thus avoiding unnecessary carriage, and the crude oil was dealt with at the refinery nearest the retorts. Then again, economies were effected in the purchase of supplies, &amp;c, and the working of the shale field as one unit has also proved most advantageous.17. For many years before the War, the industry derived a large proportion of its income at one period as much as one-half from sulphate of ammonia, the remainder being derived in about equal proportions from the liquid products and paraffin wax. Thus, it was profitable to work shale with a low oil yield, but with a high yield of ammonia. However, developments in various countries since the War in the production of synthetic ammonia and similar compounds from atmospheric nitrogen, caused the price of ammonia, which averaged about  14 per ton before the War, to fall to about  7 per ton in 1936. As a result, a large quantity of shale with a low oil yield has been rendered unworkable economically, and the industry had to turn its attention to shales of higher oil yield.Difficulties experienced by the Industry.18. From the end of the War until 1931, the industry passed through some difficult times, which resulted in considerable curtailment of operations. The main causes to which the Company attribute this curtailment are set out in the paragraphs which follow.19. During the latter part of 1919, demands were made by the workers which almost resulted in the closing down of the mines and works. Although this did not actually happen, arrangements for closing down had so far advanced that considerable losses had been sustained by the Companies before full-scale operations were resumed.20. In 1921, the national stoppage in the coalfields caused a shortage of fuel which resulted in considerable curtailment of operations. Further losses were sustained through high cost of fuel, loss of output, and cost of restoring plant to full operations. After the stoppage terminated there was a small but permanent reduction of operations.21. In 1925, as a result of the unfavourable market conditions of the preceding years, it became necessary to reduce wages. The reduction was resisted and there was a complete stoppage of the industry. When operations were eventually resumed, it was found impracticable to re-open a group of mines, crude oil works and a refinery. Market conditions continued unfavourable, and in 1931 a further group of mines, crude oil works and a refinery were closed down.22. The ultimate result of the reductions was to bring the scale of operations of the shale industry down to about 1,400,000 tons of shale per annum, its present level, compared with a little over 3 million tons in 1918. There are at present eleven shale mines working, and five retort plants producing crude oil. The whole of the crude products are treated in one central refinery at Pumpherston.Products from Shale.23. These changes in the economic position and the scale of operations of the industry were accompanied by considerable alterations in the range of products and methods of refining.
24. In the immediately pre-war period a somewhat complicated scheme of refining, which had been gradually evolved and had reached a fairly stable condition, was in operation, yielding a series of products. The approximate annual output of these products was as follows : 	Tons.Motor spirit and naphtha	27,500Illuminating and power oils ...	.....    57,000Gas and fuel oils	61,500Batching oil	32,000Lubricating oil ...       ...	32,000Total liquid products   ...	...    210,000Paraffin wax	25,000Coke      .................	7,000Sulphate of ammonia ...	63,000(In order to secure the best possible return, the products were disposed of for a wide variety of uses.)25. The industry was at that time the sole home source of many of these products, but each of them was subject to competition even in the home market from analogous products obtained from other sources.Effect of the Preferences.26. Very low prices for the whole range of products continued to prevail and the industry was in a very critical condition when in 1928, a tax of \d. per gallon was placed on motor spirit with exemption for home-produced spirit. To take advantage of this the production of motor spirit was increased by cracking-the heavier into lighter products.27. The industry thus obtained the full benefit of the exemption from the tax which was increased to 6d. per gallon in 1931, and subsequently to 8d. per gallon, at which figure it still stands.28. Economic conditions were such that it was essential to produce the maximum quantity of motor spirit, and while the quality of this was satisfactory as regards volatility, &amp;c, it was unfortunately lacking in the anti-knock characteristics demanded by modern types of engine. &quot;With rising standards of performance, an increasing proportion of other spirit had to be blended with it to produce a marketable product and the industry was again facing difficulty when the Budget of April, 1935, raised from Id. to 8d. per gallon the tax on the fuel used by compression-ignition or diesel engines, which had been for some years displacing the petrol engine for heavy road traction. The same principle of exempting home-produced fuel was followed as in the case of motor spirit, and this rendered the production of diesel fuel economically practicable to the industry, as it could be obtained by a simpler process than cracking and the quality of the product is entirely satisfactory. By this change the production of the industry has become: 	Tons.Motor spirit and naphtha	.....      23,900Light shale oil (Admiralty)   ......	.....        2,550Diesel oil         ...      ...	48,000Gasoil* ...	.....        1,950Fuel oilt	.....        2,500Total liquid products	.....      78.900Paraffin wax	.....        8,000Coke      ................	.....        2,400* Used as scrubber oil at the crude oil works.f Residue from cracking plant and used as fuel in the refinery.
29. The financial effect of the preference on shale products for the year ended the 31st March, 1935, (8d. on motor spirit and Id. per gallon on burning oil and gas oil) was  473,900, but on the basis of current production the financial effect of the preference is approximately  660,000 per annum, made up as follows : per annum.Motor spirit and naphtha, 8d. per gallon ...      ...      239,000Light shale oil, Id. per gallon       ...      ...      ... 300Diesel oil, 8d. per gallon......      ...      ...      422,000Costs of Production.30. The actual cost of manufacturing any individual product cannot be arrived at, but the total costs for mining, retorting and refining are shown below. These costs are based on current (June, 1937) rates of wages and costs of materials, but do not include any allowances for depreciation : Per ton of shale, s.   d.Mining............       .........      6   6-0Retorting and sulphate of ammonia manufacture ...      4 10 - 611   4-6Deduct Value of sulphate of ammonia produced ...      1   6-89   9-8Equal to ...      ...      ...      5-396c/. per gallon of crude oil.Add-Cost of refining      l-304d. per gallon of crude oil.Total cost      ...      6-700rf.Number of persons employed.31. At the peak of the industry&apos;s development the total number of employees  miners, oil workers, mechanics engaged in the maintenance of plant, &amp;c. was about 10,000 plus a considerable number of men, mainly in adjacent districts, engaged in supplying the coal, engineering materials, chemicals, &amp;c, used by the industry. By 1932, the number directly employed had been reduced to 3,300. Many of the men displaced found other employment, but a considerable number remained unemployed in the district.32. A scheme was introduced at the end of 1932 to enable a number of the unemployed men to be absorbed. It was arranged that all existing employees would be idle one week in every four, their places in that week being taken by former employees who were unemployed at that date. It had also been found possible, owing to an improvement in markets, to make an advance in wages to all employees, so that together with one week&apos;s unemployment relief the wages advance enabled the individual average weekly income to be maintained in all but a few cases of the most highly paid men.33. By the introduction of this &quot; spread-over &quot; system, an addition of about 1,000 was made to the number of men in regular employment three weeks in every four. This system is still in operation and the numbers of men at present employed are: ; In shale mines   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      2,232In crude oil works and refinery       ...      ...      ...      1,722Total    ..................      3,954In addition, there are 236 men employed at Baads Colliery and 78 at Bathgate and Broxburn Acid Works, the entire outputs from which are used in connection with shale operations, making a grand total of. 4,268 men, youths and boys.
34. The present average rate of wages is 10s. 6d. per day. There have been four advances between November, 1932, and May, 1937.Emergency.35. In the event of an emergency the output of the industry would be limited by the capacity of the retorting plant in existence at the time and the state of development of the mines together with the question of labour supply. As the retorting plant would normally be in full operation, any increased production would depend on the erection of additional plant which would take a considerable time, and this would also apply to any extensive mining development.36. With regard to the possible production of aviation spirit from shale oil, no effort has hitherto been made to accomplish this, and the spirit at present being produced is unsuitable for that purpose; although the proposition does not appear promising it might be found possible to obtain a proportion of spirit suitable for aviation if serious attention were given to the subject.(B) Note on the investigation by the Committee into the financial 2)osition of theShale Oil Companies.37. A member of the Committee was afforded the opportunity of examining the detailed statements of account of the operating companies and of Scottish Oils, Ltd.The following is a summary of the conclusions reached : 38. The fixed assets (i.e., mines, plant, equipment, &amp;c.) have been written down in the past in the Accounts of the various Companies to negligible figures. Their book value therefore afforded no criterion of their current worth.39. The existing Companies had other assets besides the mines and equip-ment, such as investments and cash on deposit. Profits arising from these sources had nothing to do with the Shale industry, and therefore require to be eliminated from the calculations.40. If all the fixed assets employed in the Shale industry were to be renewed to-day, the cost would be approximately  3,170,000. A part of their economic life has already expired, and after taking that into consideration the administra-tion considered that a fair value to place on these fixed assets would be about  2,170,000.41. Relative to the fixed assets, the floating assets employed in the business (i.e., stocks of stores, stocks of oil, debtors, &amp;c.) are small. At the 31st December, 1936, the total floating assets, including a small balance at bank, were slightly less than the creditors.42. The Companies have made an estimate of their profits for 1937 before providing for depreciation and before charging any abnormal expenses. This estimate amounts to  258,500, but is arrived at before making allowance for the recent reduction in the price of motor spirit, which will cost the Companies in a full year between  15,000 and  16,000. On the whole, it may be fair to assume profits at  250,000. As regards depreciation, the Companies have made a calculation based on the present-day fair value of the fixed assets; and applying varying rates of depreciation according to the assumed remaining economic life of the different classes of assets. On this basis an annual charge for depreciation is arrived at of  130,000.43.   The position as regards earning capacity is as followrs :- ;   &apos;\                                          . .    :&apos;. .Present-day value of capital employed      ...      ...      ... 2,170,000Net profits after providing for depreciation (i.e.,  250,000less  130,000)     ....      ...      ......      ...... 120,000On this basis there is a yield shown of somewhat under 6 per cent., which, in view of the nature of the industry and its i-eliance on the maintenance of the duty on imported petrol, is on the low side.
APPENDIX III.Low Temperature Carbonisation.1. The underlying principle of all processes for producing liquid hydrocarbons from coal is that of increasing the ratio of hydrogen to carbon. Bituminous coal contains 4-5 to 5-5 per cent, by weight of hydrogen, while petroleum contains about 13 per cent. An increase in the ratio can be brought about by making coal react directly with hydrogen, or by carbonising it and so splitting it into volatile fractions (gas, spirit and tar), which contain a greater percentage of hydrogen than the original coal, and a residue (coke), which contains less. Thus high temperature coke contains about 0-4 per cent, of hydrogen by weight, and high temperature tar 6 - 5 per cent.; low temperature coke 3 per cent, and low temperature tar 8 per cent.2. The amount of hydrogen present in the coal sets, therefore, a maximum to the yield of oil that can be obtained by carbonisation. For practical reasons, however, this maximum can never be attained. Some of the hydrogen appears as gas, some forms water and some is left in the coke. As the temperature of carbonisation is raised, the loss from the first cause is increased, but that from the others is diminished.3. The main product of low temperature carbonisation, amounting to from 60 to 75 per cent, by weight of the coal treated, 4s a smokeless solid fuel. The yield of tar is generally from 16 to 20 gallons per ton of coal treated, the quantities varying with the process and kind of coal used. Spirit is also scrubbed from the gas, 2 to 3 gallons being obtained per ton of coal.4. During the later part of the War, and the post-War period, the possibility of obtaining supplies of oil by low temperature carbonisation began to receive a good deal of attention, not only in technical and commercial circles, but also by the Government. During the War, the Navy had become increasingly dependent on supplies of imported oil, owing to the change from coal to oil firing in many of His Majesty&apos;s ships, and to meet possible difficulties in obtaining supplies the Government turned its attention to the question of obtaining supplies from indigenous materials. It was largely the desire to help solve this problem that led to the establishment of the Government Fuel Research Station. During the first few years of its existence priority was given to programmes of research on low temperature carbonisation, and much time and money was devoted to a study of the problems involved, and in attempting to develop a process which could be operated on a commercial scale.5. For some years an average of about  90,000 per annum has been provided by the Government for the work of the Fuel Research Coal Survey and the Fuel Research Station, and a part of this has been devoted to research in connection with the development of processes for the production of oil from coal. The Director of Fuel Research is also empowered to test, free of charge, low temperature plants operating on a commercial or semi-commercial scale subject to certain conditions. The object of the test is to provide technical information about the plant which is available to the public; no attempt being made to pronounce on its commercial possibilities.6. Besides the large amount of work carried out at the Fuel Research Station, which has been concerned with all the technical aspects of the question, such as the type of retort, the kinds of coal to be used, the range of temperatures, and the treatment of the tar or tar oil, there has been great activity on the part of many inventors and some commercial interests. A large number of methods for working the process have been evolved, many of which have never proceeded beyond the laboratory stage. As a general rule, inventors are very optimistic about the virtues of their methods and they fail to appreciate the difficulties likely to be encountered when an attempt is made to operate on a larger scale. In addition the yield of tar obtained from coal in the laboratory is not realised! in a large scale plant. It is borne out by experience that it is unwise to proceed to the erection of a commercial scale plant on the results obtained in a small laboratory
plant. If laboratory results are satisfactory the next step should be the setting up of a semi-commercial scale unit, before large scale production is attempted. In some cases inventors have been unable to secure sufficient capital for the development of their methods to the semi-commercial stage. In others, which were developed to that stage, difficulties of a technical or commercial nature arose, and the plant was subsequently abandoned, after considerable financial losses.7. The early history of the industry on the financial side has been an unhappy one. A number of companies were established for the development of processes, with very little experience behind them, and the prospects of obtaining large profits from the industry made a strong appeal to members of the general public, who were invited to subscribe capital.. In most cases the hopes held out were not realised and very substantial sums of money invested by the public have been lost.8. The Committee were informed that the Mines Department has informa-tion regarding about 150 of these systems. About 25 of them have at some time operated on a commercial or semi-commercial scale.9. Low temperature carbonisation processes can be classified as explained in paragraph 101 of the Report, in two main categories, (a) those which carbonise coal alone, and (b) those which carbonise a mixture of coal and oil. These categories should be further classified according to the design of the retorts and the conditions of operation, since these will affect the nature and yield of the tar and spirit. The principal processes operated in Great Britain may be divided into six groups : 10. Category (a). (i) In which static charges of relatively small coal are carbonised (Low Temperature Carbonisation, Ltd., British Carbonised Fuel, Ltd.).(ii) In which continuous narrow vertical retorts of firebrick are used to carbonise all types of coal and cannel (Fuel Research Station).(iii) In which continuous vertical retorts are used which are best suited for the carbonisation of coals possessing weakly caking properties (British Oil and Fuel Conservation, Ltd., Comae Oil Co., Ltd.).(iv) In which continuous vertical retorts are used, and arrangements are made for the combustion of part of the coke and for the passage of the hot gases through the charge (Maclaurin Coal Products, Ltd., Bussey Coal Distillation Co., Ltd., the Babcock process).. (v) In which the retorts are rotated or the coal is mechanically stirred or moved (British Coal Distillation Co., Ltd., the Salermo process, Stellite, Ltd., the Morgan process, the Freeman process).11. Category (b). (vi) In which mixtures of oil and coal are distilled and carbonised (National Coke and Oil Co., Ltd., Coal and Allied Industries, Ltd., Catalysts, Ltd., the Knowles process operated by H. A. Brassert and Co., Ltd.). In some of these processes, petroleum oil has been used so that the fuels produced are not entirely of home origin.12.&apos; In regard to the last group, the Committee were informed that six such processes have been investigated at the Fuel Research Station and it has been found that in no case has the yield of oil from the mixture been greater than when the constituents are carbonised separately. In other words, any increase in the yield of tar per ton of mixture comes from the oil used and there is no increase in the yield from the coal on account of its having been carbonised in admixture with oil. Under certain circumstances a limited proportion of the tar may be converted into spirit.13. The quality of the coke is a first consideration in a low temperature carbonisation process. To ensure that it will ignite readily and burn freely, it must retain a percentage of volatile matter. It follows, therefore, that the temperature and conditions chosen for carbonisation are not necessarily those that would give the greatest yield of motor spirit and tar. The quality, as well as the quantity, of tar produced are affected by the choice of working Conditions. The best compromise between high yield and high quality is attained by carbonising a weakly caking coal in lump form in a stream of inert gas or steam. The largest vield is obtained at temperatures in the neighbourhood of 550oC. &quot;
14. When smaller coal is carbonised, or the temperature is raised, the tar tends to be cracked, giving a smaller total yield which contains more pitch and even free carbon. This point may be illustrated by the following table showing the results of experiments carried out at the Fuel Research Station : Influence of sizes of coal on the nature and yield of tar.Coal.

During 1936, 15 low temperature carbonisation plants were operating on a commercial or semi-commercial scale, and a total quantity of 364,305 tons of coal were carbonised. In addition, 19,490 tons of coal and 720 tons of coke were used for purposes other than processing, e.g., power, steam-raising, &amp;c.Products Obtained from Low Temperature Carbonisation.Low Temperature Coke.16. This smokeless fuel is produced primarily for use in the open domestic grate, and is one of the means by which smoke normally produced in such grates may be reduced. Since a higher degree of radiant heat is obtained by its use, the coke has weight for weight a greater efficiency than raw coal. It is suitable for all types of domestic heating, including closed boilers and stoves. The yield per ton of coal carbonised varies according to the type of process used from 9 to about 15 cwts.17. At present, low temperature coke commands a ready sale, production has increased from 151,730 tons in 1931 to 287,133 tons in 1936. The greater proportion of this is made by one company, Low Temperature Carbonisation, Ltd. It has been stated by the Company that, when the new plant in South Wales has been completed, the total quantity of coal treated by them will amount to 800,000 tons a year. In 1936, the total quantity of coal carbonised at all plants amounted to 364,300 tons.18. In default of legislative action, however, it seems unlikely that a very large percentage of the coal burnt domestically, which may be estimated to be of the order of 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 tons a year, will be replaced by smokeless fuel, unless the selling price of the latter is materially reduced. The present retail price of low temperature coke in London is about 63s. Qd. per ton, compared with 45s. for gas coke and 58s. Qd. for best house coal.19. Certain low temperature cokes are suitable for use in gas-producers for motor vehicle propulsion.Low Temperature Tar.20. The yield of tar obtained by low temperature carbonisation ranges from 10 to 20 gallons per ton of coal carbonised according to the process and the coal used, the average figure for 1936 being 16-9 gallons.21. In the case of the brick retorts used at the Fuel Research Station, the yield is about 18-5 gallons depending on the coal. When this tar is distilled (topped), about 1 - 5 gallons of motor spirit are obtained. The remaining 17-0 gallons may be used as a heavy boiler fuel. If the tar is distilled until pitch is produced, 10-5 gallons of light fuel oil and 80 lbs. of pitch are obtained. The heavy boiler fuel mentioned above cannot be used in admixture with petroleum oils. The light fuel oil is, however, miscible in all proportions with petroleum fuel oils.
22. A fuel oil produced from low temperature tar by Low Temperature Carbonisation, Ltd., has been tested by the Admiralty and found satisfactory for use under normal service conditions. It is also stated that recent experiments have shown that a diesel oil, which can be made suitable for road transport purposes by the addition of a small percentage of dope (which may add appreciably to the cost of the oils), can be obtained from the tar oils; and that low temperature diesel oils can be mixed with petroleum diesel oil up to 25 per cent, of the former to give a good fuel for high speed diesel engines.23. Low temperature tar contains a greater proportion of tar acids than high temperature tar. These tar acids are, for the most part, higher boiling compounds than phenols and cresols. There is a gradually developing demand for tar acids of this type and the market is extending.24. Low temperature tar is amenable to treatment by hydrogenation, and can be converted into an equal volume of motor spirit by this means. The percentage yields from low temperature tar obtained by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., in their commercial-scale plant at Billingham were rather lower than those obtained from creosote.25. If light fuel oil is required, this may also be produced by hydrogenation of the tar. If the tar is hydrogenated by only one treatment in the plant and the product distilled, about 10 gallons of motor spirit and 10 gallons of light fuel oil are produced from 20 gallons of tar. The light fuel oil can, if desired, be converted into motor spirit by further hydrogenation.26. During 1936, some 6^ million gallons of tar were obtained from low temperature carbonisation. Of this quantity, about 2 million gallons were sold :to Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., for hydrogenation. The remainder was treated by the producers to obtain light, middle, and heavy oils, or was sold to tar distillers.Motor Spirit.27. It is stated that besides the motor spirit obtainable by the treatment of the tar, about 3 gallons of crude spirit are obtainable by scrubbing the gas produced during carbonisation. From this spirit a first grade petrol is obtained for use in motor vehicles.28. From the crude spirit produced by Low Temperature Carbonisation, Ltd., an aviation spirit has been produced which, during the past few years has been used in a number of home defence squadrons of the Royal Air Force, sometimes alone and sometimes mixed with petroleum spirit. The Committee were informed, however, that its use is not likely to be continued, as it does not conform with the specification of the Air Ministry which, for the future, will apply to the bulk of the requirements.29. Altogether, in 1936, about 800,000 gallons of refined motor spirit were obtained from low temperature carbonisation.Gas produced by Low Temperature Carbonisation.30. The quantity and quality of the gas produced by low temperature carbonisation varies greatly according to the method used. With certain types of the process, very large quantities of gas of a low calorific value are produced which are difficult to dispose of.31. The Committee were informed that in most cases the gas was not sold, but was used in the process to heat the retorts. In the case of those processes producing a high calorific value gas, .it. was stated that if the gas companies were to purchase it, it would save them buying oil for enrichment purposes, as it would be possible, by using the low temperature gas, to make up any deficiency in the calorific value of their own gas caused by the addition of water gas, &amp;c.32. Low temperature gas of a high calorific value could also be used, when compressed, in motor vehicles, and a larger mileage per unit volume of gas could be obtained than with town&apos;s gas.
o6933. A further claim made for low temperature gas is that it can be liquefied to the extent of over one-third of its quantity and sold in containers for domestic and industrial uses.Tests carried out by the Fuel Research Station.34. The following are the Companies whose low temperature carbonisation plants have been tested by the Staff of the Fuel Research Station. Reports on 1-13 have been published.(1(2:(3:4 ip(6 (7 (8(9 (10&apos; (11 (12f (13 (14 (15&apos;Low Temperature Carbonisation, Ltd. Midland Coal Products, Ltd.

J      in the development of the plant.Of the above processes which have been tested, the following have plants which are now in operation : Low Temperature Carbonisation, Ltd.35. This Company operates the process known as the &quot; Coalite &quot; (or Parker) process, which has proved the most successful commercially: but it would seem that manufacturing costs are high. Plants are also operated by two subsidiary companies, viz. : Doncaster Coalite, Ltd., and Derbyshire Coalite Company, Ltd., and by the South Metropolitan Gas Company.36.   The situation and capacity of the several plants are as follows : Operating Company.	Situation of Plant.	Retorts.			Number.	Total rated daily throughput.Low   Temperature  Carbonisation, Ltd. ...

In this process the plant is composed of settings of retorts which are made of special cast-iron and are externally heated. The throughput from each retort is about 1^ tons per day. The carbonisation of small charges in static retorts limits the choice of coals and/or necessitates the blending of different coals. By distillation of the coal oils it is claimed that the following products can be obtained : Aviation spirit. Motor spirit. Diesel oil. Fuel oil.Tar Acids and other usual derivatives.
Maclaurin Coal Products, Ltd.38. This Company owns the &quot; Maclaurin &quot; process, which is the invention of Mr. Robert Maclaurin. It is efficient for carbonising certain types of weakly-caking coals, but large quantities of gas of a low calorific value are produced. In this process the retorts are internally heated.39. Two Maclaurin plants are known to have operated. The first was a battery of five units, each with a rated capacity of 20 tons of coal per day, erected at the Dalmarnock Gas Works of the Glasgow City Corporation in June, 1925. This plant ceased operations in 1932.40. The second plant, consisting of two retorts, was put into operation at the Nuneaton Gas Works in 1928, and was originally controlled by a subsidiary company known as the Maclaurin Fuel Oil and Gas Company. It is still in use for supplying gas of low calorific value (200 B.Th.U.&apos;s) for lighting, heating and industrial purposes for the whole of Nuneaton, special arrangements having been made rendering it practicable to use such a gas.British Coal Distillation Co., Ltd.41. This company works what was originally known as the &quot; L. and N.&quot; process. A plant, with certain modifications, consisting of one retort (with a rated daily throughput of 100 tons of coal), situated at the New Lount Colliery, Leicestershire, has been operated for some time for experimental and demonstration purposes.42. The process carbonises non-caking coals in rotary retorts which are internally heated. It is an interesting development, as fine slacks, having non-caking properties, may be used. The yield of tar is not so great as in some processes and a large volume of gas of low calorific value is made. The solid product is in a fine state of division and must be briquetted with pitch, which must then be distilled off to produce a smokeless fuel. The briquetted fuel has been proved to have some special characteristics and, in particular, has given promising results in gas producers for use on motor vehicles.43. A new plant with a capacity of 450 tons of coal per day to work the process is to be built at one of the B.A. Collieries, near Notingham.Coal Research Syndicate.44. The Coal Research Syndicate, Ltd., operates the C.R.S. process at Crown Farm Colliery, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. The plant consists of two retorts with a total rated daily throughput of 64 tons of coal.45. In this case, weakly-caking coal is charged into a vertical retort capable of treating 20 to 25 tons in one charge. The coal is heated internally by the gas produced, so that the surplus gas is of very low calorific value.National Coke and Oil Company, Ltd.46. This Company operates a process known as the &quot; Cannock &quot; process. There are at present two plants in existence, one at Tipton, near Birmingham, and the other at Erith, Kent.47. Both plants are of the same capacity, comprising four retorts each, with a total rated daily throughput of 160 tons of coal.48. A mixture of 50-50 of coal and creosote is carbonised and distilled in rotary retorts, but certain quantities of &quot; make-up 55 oil are added which, it is understood, is a petroleum oil. The economic success of the process depends to a considerable measure upon the price and availability of supplies of creosote. The solid product obtained consists of about 33 per cent, of fuel above f inch in size. If the remainder is to be sold as lump fuel, it must be briquetted with pitch. The gas produced is not sufficient for the carbonisation, and must be augmented with producer gas. The manufacturing costs include those of pulverising the coal, making it into a paste with creosote, distilling the product from the retort and briquetting the coke breeze.
49. During 1936, the following total quantities of raw materials were treated at the two plants : The products per ton of coal and oil mixture processed were: semi-coke, 14 cwt.; gas, 4,644 cubic feet (750-800 B.Th.U.&apos;s); and 6-8 gallons of motor spirit.  It is claimed that the plant can produce Diesel oil as well as motor spirit.Catalysts, Ltd.50. This Company operates a small plant at Dartford, which was installed for experimental purposes. In the process, a mixture of coal and oil is distilled. The higher-boiling fractions of the liquid product after being treated with a catalyst can be mixed with fresh coal and returned to the retort.The Morgan Process.51. This process is at present being worked on an experimental scale, but the scale of operations was considered to be large enough to warrant a test. In the process, which uses a rotary retort, part of,the coal is burned in order to carbonise the remainder.52. The coke produced is small in size, and would have to be briquetted to be used for domestic purposes. It is claimed that the solid product can be burned under boilers or used in chain grate stokers. The tar produced has a somewhat high specific gravity and was found to contain some 10 per cent, of coke dust.The Freeman Process.53. This process, which has also been tested by the Fuel Research Station, but is not now working, is included because of the amount of interest that has been shown concerning it.54. In 1925, a test was carried out by the Director of Fuel Research, which proved a failure, but as it was recognised that the process appeared to have certain novel features, it was decided to carry out a second test. The Fuel Research Department accordingly took the unusual course of agreeing to take a lease of the plant (at a nominal rent) for a period of four months, to enable the Director of Fuel Research to carry out such experiments as he wished. There was not time to complete all the investigations desired before the Company parted with the control of the site, and the plant had consequently to be dismantled.55. Since the tests were carried out, Mr. Freeman, the inventor of the process, claims to have introduced modifications and improvements into his process. But, so far, he has only a small demonstration plant on a laboratory scale in London, and it is not considered that the plant is of such a size as to enable an official test to be carried out. The present Company holding the Freeman patents is named &quot; Coal-Oil Development (Great Britain), Ltd.&quot;56. In addition to the processes set out above, are the following, which are in operation at present, but have not been tested by the staff of the Fuel Research Station.The Hird Process.57. This process has been devised by Mr. H. P. Hird, and is owned by Messrs. British Carbonised Fuels, Ltd. Only one plant exists. It has 17 retorts in operation, with a total rated daily throughput of 30 tons of coal. This was installed in January, 1934, at JSfostell Colliery, near Wakefield, on contract for the Nostell Colliery Company, Ltd., and comprised at first 12 retorts with a total daily throughput of 20 tons.CoalCreosote  ... TarPetroleum oil13,207 tons 104,460 gallons 31,203 95,064
58. The process consists of carbonising coal in static charges in cast iron retorts which hold two tons of coal. The coal used in the process contains a very low percentage of ash and the solid fuel resulting is a first class smokeless fuel.59. Samples of fuel oil supplied by the &quot; Hird &quot; process have been examined by the Admiralty, but they have failed to reach the standard demanded by the Admiralty specification.The Knowles Process.60. The Knowles process is an adaptation of the Knowles coke oven plant to the carbonisation treatment of a mixture of pulverised coal and oil.61. A unit of this plant has been erected at the Corby Works of Messrs. Stewarts and Lloyds, Ltd. Up to the present, it has not been operated continuously under the conditions for which it was built. The original process consisted of carbonising a mixture of petroleum oil and coal, and cracking the oils produced in a Dubbs Cracking Plant. The heavier oils thus produced were returned to the commencement of the plant to be mixed with more coal, while a small addition of fresh oil was made.62. Towards the end of 1934, the use of petroleum oil as the liquid medium was discontinued on account of (a) the Customs duty; (b) the deposition of sludge by the action of the petroleum oil on pitch; and (c) the desirability of dealing entirely with materials obtained at Corby.63. While the original intention was apparently that the new material processed should be f coal and ^ tar, in 1935, coal represented only 30 per cent, of the new material, and the proportion was further reduced in 1936 to 14 per cent.The Moore (or Stellite) Process.64. This process was the invention of Mr. Samuel Moore of the firm of Catherall and Company, Ltd., Buckley, Flintshire, firebrick manufacturers. A 50 tons per week experimental plant was erected at their works, and a private company, named The Moore Carbonising Company, Ltd., was formed at the end of 1932 to acquire and work the patents. In May, 1934, a new public company, &quot; Stellite, Ltd.,&quot; was formed to take over the process and plant from the Moore Carbonising Company, Ltd.65. The only &apos;&apos; Moore &quot; plant in operation is situated at Queen&apos;s Ferry, near Chester, and comprises 96 retorts, with a total rated daily throughput of 200 tons of coal.66. In the process, the coal is passed through clay retorts by means of a special type of conveyor.   The retorts are externally heated by producer gas.The Gill-Tozer (or Carlton) Process.67. One &apos;&apos; Gill&quot; plant is known to exist. This has been operated by the Carlton Main Colliery Company, Ltd., at Grimethorpe Colliery, near Barnsley, since October, 1930. The plant is on.a semi-commercial scale, and consists of four retorts in one setting, with a total rated daily throughput of 16 tons of coal.The Salermo Process.68. One Salermo plant has been erected in this country, although it is reported that other plants exist in Belgium, the Saar, Italy, Jugo-Slavia and South Africa. During 1933, the erection of a Salermo plant to deal with 50 to 75 tons of coal per day was completed at the Southall Works by the Gas Light and Coke Company. The object of the installation was to provide a substitute non-caking material (in the form of low temperature coke) to blend with caking coals. The process does not produce directly lump fuel of the type required for domestic use.
Fuel Research Process.69. The narrow brick retorts designed at the Fuel Research Station are claimed to possess certain technical advantages in that firebrick has been used in the construction of the retorts. The process in principle is very similar to that of the vertical retorts used in the manufacture of coal gas.70. If smokeless fuel is to be more than a luxury fuel it would seem that the cost of the plant and the necessary provision for its obsolescence must be reduced to a minimum. The cost of the Fuel Research Station retorts is low and is comparable with that of ordinary vertical retorts, but is less because fire-brick can be used in place of silica. The process is flexible since it will treat coals of widely differing nature and size.71. In 1936, a plant consisting of six retorts to this design was brought into operation by the South Yorkshire Chemical Works, Ltd., at Parkgate, near Rotherham, and as a result of successful working a further unit of six retorts is being erected.&apos; .72. A statement is attached which gives a list of all low temperature carbonisation plants which have operated in recent years with particulars of the coal carbonised and the yields of products obtained in the most recent year of operation.[16154]

APPENDIX IV.Hydrogenation (Bergius Process).I. The history of hydrogenation so far as this country is concerned goes back to 1921, when Sir George Beilby had some discussions with Dr. Bergius, the German inventor of the process. As a result, in 1923, experiments were commenced at the Fuel Research Station, and a year later several important firms formed the British Bergius Syndicate for the purpose of investigating the process in relation to British coals.2. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., joined the Syndicate in 1925, and by 1927, this Company had acquired the entire assets of the Syndicate, which it was stated consisted in options to obtain licences under the Bergius patents subject to payments to the International Bergius Syndicate.3. About this time the German I.G. Company, who were most actively occupied in the coal- hydrogenation field, concluded an agreement with the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, and were later joined by the Royal-Dutch-Shell Group, who were also interested in hydrogenation, mainly in regard to the treatment of oils and tars. In 1930, the three groups formed International Hydrogenation Patents, Ltd., which provided for the pooling of all patents and technical information.4. Meanwhile, Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., were independently developing a process of their own for the treatment of coal. They found, however, that the group formed by the above companies held several hundred patents, and to facilitate their own activities and avoid continuous patent litigation, they considered it desirable to participate with the other groups.5. In 1931, the Company concluded an agreement with the new combine which brought them into the pool and gave them important rights for the British Empire.6. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., state that this arrangement is working satisfactorily, and in practice there are no restrictive clauses in their agreement which would prevent the large scale development of hydrogenation if this were considered desirable and practicable.7. Experimental work started at Billingham early in 1927, and in 1929, it was decided to build a pilot plant there to treat 10 tons per day of coal. The plant was started up later in the same year and ran until the end of 1931.8. In 1930, Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., gave Government experts an opportunity of making a full investigation of the work which was being done and of examining available data in regard to costs. For some time subsequently discussions took place with the Government as to the possibility of securing development of the process on a larger scale.9. In July, 1933, the Government announced their intention of introducing legislation to give a guaranteed preference on home-produced motor spirit over a period of years, and on this undertaking being given Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., decided to proceed at once with the erection of a large scale commercial plant. This plant, which was built with capital entirely provided by the Company, commenced operation, for the treatment of creosote, in February, 1935.   Coal was injected in June of that year.10. The essential feature of the hydrogenation process, whether applied to coal, to tar oils, or to petroleum oils, is that hydrogen supplied from an external source is made to combine with the carbon in the coal or coal tar by means of a catalytic process with the object of converting these substances into oil, or, in the case of petroleum, of improving the yields and qualities of particular oil products.II. In the plant at Billingham there are two main sections, the liquid phase system and the vapour phase system. The former, which is carried out in two stages, is used for the purpose of liquefying coal and treating oils of high boiling point, and the latter for liquid products of lower boiling points. With petroleum oils or coal tar oils of suitable boiling point, the liquid phase system can be omitted, which, as will appear later, is a matter of considerable importance.
12. The coal to be processed is first subjected to a cleaning operation. The clean coal is then mixed in a grinding mill with an equal weight of coal oil, to form a paste. To the paste is added a small quantity of catalyst. The catalysts used vary, both with the raw material and the product it is desired to make.13. The paste is then injected against a working pressure of about 275 atmospheres (pressures up to 350 atmospheres are contemplated by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., in any new plant, and in Germany it is understood that pressures up to 700 atmospheres are being adopted), and is passed to the hydrogenation plant, where it is mixed with hydrogen in converters at the required temperature.   Liquefaction of the coal takes place at about 450oC.14. The coal, with the exception of a small quantity of coke and oily residue, which is used as a fuel, is transformed into oils, which consist of heavy oil, middle oil and petrol. The heavy oil is re-cycled. The middle oil is subjected to treatment in the vapour phase plant, in which the oil is vaporised, mixed with hydrogen as before in the presence of a fixed catalyst. The vapour phase product is then distilled to separate the petrol from the residual middle oil, which is treated again. The petrol as it leaves the plant is a finished, high-grade product ready for use.15. From time to time information has been supplied to His Majesty&apos;s Government by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., regarding the production of petrol and the total amount of coal used, and some months ago certain data on the economics of the process were also furnished. In the autumn of last year the Company prepared, at the Governments request, an estimate of the cost of building a new coal hydrogenation plant. &quot;All this information has been placed before the Committee, and, in addition, much more information not previously available has been submitted to the Committee by the Company. The Committee gave an undertaking that this very full information, much of which it is not practicable to record in this Appendix, would be regarded by the Committee as strictly confidential, since it involved the disclosure of much data of a commercial and scientific character, which the Company could not agree to furnish on any other basis.16.   The notes which follow will deal with :  I.- The results at Billingham. II. The possibilities of a new coal hydrogenation plant. III. A scheme for a plant dealing with tar oils only.I. The residts at Billingham.Capacity of plant.17. The plant was originally intended to deal with coal only and to have a rated output capacity of 100,000 tons (30 million gallons) of motor spirit. It was subsequently decided to include provision for the treatment of coal tars to the extent of 50,000 tons of petrol per annum, thus making the capacity 150,000 tons (45 million gallons) of petrol.Coal and tar requirements.18. The quantity of coal required for this plant when in full operation is stated to be as follows : Tons.(a) Coal hydrogenation.*For processing ...............      150-200,000For all other purposes (steam power, hydrogen production, &amp;c.)     ...      300-350,000500,000t(b) Tar oils hydrogenation.For steam power, hydrogen production    ...      ... 100,000Total ............... 600,000* The exact quantity depends, amongst other things, on the ash and moisture content of the coal.j- In addition about 60,000 tons of tar oils are required.
This gives for the coal hydrogenation 1 ton of petrol for each 1^ to 2 tons processed, or for each 5 tons of total coal used.Yields of Products.19. With the plant in full operation it had been expected to process 154,000 tons per annum of coal (ash and moisture free basis) and obtain a yield of 64-5 per cent, of petrol, equivalent to 100,000 tons. It was also intended to treat 67,000 tons per annum of creosote and make therefrom 58,000 tons of petrol equivalent to a yield of 86-5 per cent.20. Difficulties with coal hydrogenation have resulted up to date in much less coal being used and more creosote, supplemented by some low temperature tar.21.   During 1936, which was the first full calendar year of working of the plant, the following results were obtained : Total production of petrol 119,700 tons.*Coal hydrogenated.81,500 tons (on an ash and moisture free basis)Creosote and Tar hydrogenated.Creosote     ........ 89,000 tons 1Low temperature tar 10,000 tons/The total quantity of coal used at the plant was 425,000 tons.22. The Company supplied a very full and frank note of the difficulties which had been experienced with coal hydrogenation. There have been no difficulties of a fundamental character; but the mechanical and teething troubles which were to be expected in putting into operation a plant of this scale for the development of a new industry appear to have been greater than had been allowed for by the technical staff. The management of the Company, however, expressed themselves as not surprised or disappointed. When the Committee visited Billingham they were informed that the conditions on the plant were quite satisfactory mechanically and promising a steady technical improvement.23. As an example of the progress it was pointed out that the percentage yield of petrol from coal processed had already been raised from 46^ to 50, and it was expected that a figure of 56 per cent, would be reached in a year or two. It was not expected, however, that the present Billingham plant would ever exceed 58 per cent. The Company are nevertheless confident that if a new plant were erected, in which improvements based on the experience already gained were embodied, a yield of 61-3 per cent, would be attained.24. It may be mentioned that, apart from the difficulties arising from the working of the plant, the lower yields obtained were partly due to the fact that twice since the plant started the quality of the petrol has had to be improved to meet the demands of the market for petrols with higher octane numbers. This had necessitated some modifications of the plant and the use of a fresh catalyst, and had thus involved the Company in considerable expenditure without any corresponding increase in revenue.Capital cost.25. The capital cost of the plant as given in the information supplied to the Committee was  6,914,000. More than half this amount represented the value of certain plant formerly provided for the making of fertilisers, taken over for use in connection with the hydrogenation plant. The plant still stands in the Company&apos;s book at approximately its original cost.   The plant transferred* After making adjustments for changes in stocks, &amp;c, the quantity shown in the Statement of Accounts submitted to the Committee as net make or sales during the year was 110,075 tons-Petrol Percentage produced.        yield.37,370 tons 46 qo oon t- f 84 1 Average82,330 tons       i 75 f     83
was built at a period of high values, and the lower figure of about  5-1 million for a complete hydrogenation plant, published two or three years ago, allowed for the lower prices which then prevailed.Costs of production.26. The difficulties with coal hydrogenation have obviously led to larger working costs than were originally estimated, but this has to some extent been offset by the treatment of a larger proportion of creosote and low temperature tar.27. The Company originally estimated that the works cost, including factory overheads, would be just under Id. per gallon of petrol. The figure supplied to the Committee in respect of the year 1936 was about \0d. a gallon and the Company estimated that this might be reduced to just over $\d. About 2d. of the increase was due to increased coal, tar and labour costs and about f d. was in respect of extra repair and alteration costs and reduced yields. These figures of cost do not include any allowance for depreciation and obsolescence, interest or profit.Realisation price.28. The average realisation price obtained for the petrol sold in 1936, was stated to be 12 - 2d. per gallon so that there was a balance of 2 - 2d. per gallon to meet the charges not included in the works cost.29. During 1936, the receipts from the sale of petrol exceeded the works cost of producing it by some  300,000. This amount, however, was not nearly sufficient to make provision for adequate charges for depreciation and obsolescence of plant, and a reasonable rate of return for the capital invested. That there was a works profit at all was due to the preference of Qd. per gallon at present granted to home-produced motor spirit.30. On the other hand, it would appear that if it had not been possible to utilise the plant, wmich had proved surplus for the production of fertilisers, for the hydrogenation works, much of it might have been idle and earning no profit at all.Depreciation and obsolescence.31. Considerable discussion took place with representatives of the Company on this subject. The Accounts submitted to the Committee included nothing for this item, and it was explained that depreciation and obsolescence in Imperial Chemical Industries Companies generally was provided for by a central fund maintained at the Head Office, after receiving returns sent in from all the various works. The Company maintained that if a concern like Billingham had to be looked at as a separate undertaking, it would not be safe, having regard to the nature of the process and the fact that it was still in an early stage of develop-ment, to allow less than 10 per cent, for depreciation and obsolescence. At the request of the Committee, the Company submitted a statement supplying in some detail all the main items in the capital charges, and, taking account only of the life of the plant, a figure of just over 5 per cent, on the whole capital was arrived at. The Company made it clear, however, that they could not, for reasons which are referred to in the body of the Report, accept such a basis as adequate.32. The charge for depreciation and obsolescence on the basis of 10 per cent, would be 4-25ti. per gallon, and for depreciation alone at 5 per cent., 2-13ci., giving total costs of production of 13-92^. and ll-80cf. per gallon respectively before allowing for interest on capital.II- The possibilities of a new coal hydrogenation plant.33. If a new hydrogenation plant were to be built, it would have to be designed to use coal only, as there are not available in normal times supplies of creosote or low temperature tar in sufficient quantities to provide for another mixed coal and tar plant. The plant would therefore have a capacity of 150,000 tons of petrol produced from coal only.
Capital Cost.34. The capital cost of such a plant (to include land, offices, site development and design charges, research charges essential for this new plant, working capital, interest during construction, and fees payable to the International Hydrogenation Patents, Ltd.) is estimated by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., at  8 million, made up approximately as follows : Cost of plant, materials, &amp;c.     General services and workshops...      .... 1,035,000Boilers and power plant ...      ....      ... 1,570,000Gas-making, purification and compres-sion............... 1,762,000Hydrogenation plant and refinery      ... 2,880,000Sundry charges rResearch during construction   ...      ... 50,000Interest during construction    ...      ... 300,000Working capital............ 250,000LHP. fee............... 150,0007,247,000750,0007,997,000 Say,  8,000,000.This estimate takes into account the increased cost of materials since the Billingham hydrogenation plant was built, and incorporates all the latest technical improvements.Costs of Production.35. The quantity of coal required would be at the rate of 4 -1 tons per ton of petrol produced, and for the purpose of the estimate, a price of 17s. per ton delivered, for producer coal, and 14s. per ton for all other coal, has been taken. The coal for processing is taken from the coal shown at 14s. per ton and, after undergoing a special cleaning operation, is charged to the hydrogenation plant at 18s. per ton. It is estimated on this basis that the actual manufacturing cost would be 7-20(2. per gallon. (Each additional Is. per ton on the price of coal adds -16*2. to the cost per gallon of petrol.) The figure of 7-20(2. includes works overhead charges (-64(2.), but does not take into account depreciation, obsolescence, interest on capital.36. On the capital of  8 million the cost per gallon in respect of depreciation and obsolescence would be 4 - 27d. and for depreciation only 2 -13(2. Thus, the total costs of production would be 11- 4:7d. and 9-33(2. respectively, before allowing for interest on capital.III. Plant for treatment of tar oils only.37. In view of the greater success achieved in the hydrogenation of tar oils, the Committee asked Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., if they had con-sidered the possibility of building such a plant, or had prepared any estimates.38. In evidence before the Committee, the Company stated that they had considered a scheme for a plant to deal with low temperature tar designed to produce 21,000 tons of petrol per annum. A reasonably detailed estimate had been prepared which indicated that, on a site where the ancillary services, e.g., power and steam, were available without fresh capital expenditure, such a plant would cost about  750,000. This would include, besides the cost of plant, charges for research during construction, interest during construction and fees.39. Assuming the cost of the tar at 4(2. per gallon, it was estimated that the manufacturing cost, including factory overhead charges, would be 9-5(2. per gallon, while the charge in respect of depreciation and obsolescence would be 2 - 86(2. and that for depreciation only 1 - 43(2. per gallon. The total production costs would therefore be 12-36(2. and 10-93(2. per gallon respectively, before allowing for interest on capital.
40. The Company added that a plant of 50,000. tons per annum had not been estimated in detail, but the manufacturing costs would be lower, and these costs would continue to fall, up to an annual output of about 100,000 tons per annum.41. The Company pointed out that they were at present taking practically all the low temperature tar at present available, and the yield of petrol from it represented about 6 per cent, of the present production of Billingham. There was no case, therefore, for the erection of a special plant to deal with such tar at the moment.42. The Company were subsequently asked to consider whether it would be practicable to submit a scheme to the Committee for a plant designed to produce about 100,000 tons per annum of aviation spirit from creosote, the plant to be worked only in the event of a national emergency.43. In view of the special character of this proposal, the Memorandum submitted by the Company is given in full: &quot; Imperial Chemical Industries, Limited.Estimate for Special Plant to produce for Emergency Use 100,000 Tonnes* per Year of A aviation Petrol by Hydrogenation of Creosote.We draw attention to the fact that this estimate is to be regarded as strictly confidential. We would further add that, while it has been prepared with as much accuracy as possible in the circumstances, the time available, having regard to other work on our hands, has been a limitation. We should therefore like you to regard this as a guide, the details of which would need to be re-examined for confirmation if a more concrete scheme were being formulated.Basis of Estimate.In taking evidence from LCI. on the 22nd June, the C.I.D. Sub-Committee displayed a keen interest in a plant to meet an emergency demand for 100,000 tonnes per year of aviation spirit.The high capital cost of the direct hydrogenation of coal, coupled with certain intrinsic difficulties of operation, had led the Sub-Committee to consider other possible raw material. A favourable opportunity in their view presented itself in the normal export of some 100,000 tonnes of creosote annually, as it was thought that in an emergency an embargo could be placed on this material which would then be available for hydrogenation to produce aviation spirit.The plant would not be operated in normal times and a very low unit capital cost would therefore be regarded as of paramount importance.Further examination of the creosote proposal in this light has disclosed greater merit than was at first anticipated and the scheme has therefore been adopted.Features of the Creosote Scheme.The following considerations characterise the scheme as now devised : 1. The sole purpose is the production of aviation spirit (specification DTD 230) for emergency use. Consequently it is not necessary for the plant to be capable of complying with current marketed specifications for normal (motoring) purposes, i.e., straight No. 1 and No. 3 spirits; nor, in fact, can the plant now being considered be so capable.2. Running costs are subservient to capital charges. For this reason services are assumed available and used to the maximum, e.g., electric drives, based on the grid, and availability of coke oven gas.* Note. Throughout this memorandum, the metric tonne of 2,204 lbs. has been used.
General Scheme of Plant.Advantage has been taken of the above two characteristics in the following important technical details : -(a) The creosote is cut to approximately 330oC. and only the lighterfraction processed thereby eliminating all liquid phase plant.The heavy fraction is relatively small in volume and it is possible to use this as a rather inferior fuel oil.(b) The vapour phase plant itself is designed for single stage catalyticconditions, such as existed in Billingham up to June, 1937. While unsuitable for current market requirements (apart from &quot; Ethyl &quot; and spirit to Air Ministry Specification DTD 230), such a plant is if anything technically better for making DTD 230 itself, and, of course, greatly simplified in both conversion and gas circulation sections.(c) Methane-steam plant is adopted, with caustic soda washing forsulphur removal: any make-up gas is supplied from coke ovens assumed adjacent.(d) Lancashire boilers are used for process steam.   All drives possibleare electric, power being obtainable from the grid.Production, &amp;c.The annual output will be 100,000 tonnes (30^- million gallons) of petrol of 52 per cent, volatility at 100o C, 6^ lbs. Reid Vapour pressure, 87 octane number with not more than 4 ccs. of T.E.L.The annual creosote requirement is about 145,000 tonnes. This has to be fractionated the greater part, viz., 115.000 tonnes of light creosote, being hydrogenated and the balance of 30,000 tonnes being disposed of for fuel oil purposes.The following services are demanded : Producer and boiler coal : 88,400 tonnes per year. Coke oven gas : 4,050 cubic metres per hour. Electric power : 12,260 kw. Clean water : 223 cubic metres per hour.Capital Cost.At current prices the estimated capital cost is  2,550,000, which includes general contingencies, design and engineering fees, construction general charges, fees to I.H.P. and a first charge of catalyst.The following are not included : purchase of site, rail, road and water access to site, special off-loading facilities, services (water, electricity, coke oven gas), research and interest charges during construction, or working capital.The cost of these items cannot be accurately assessed until site conditions are specified, but the overall capital cost will probably prove to be about  3,000,000. This figure would still not include the capital cost of providing coke oven gas, electricity and water, but would include the cost of connecting these services from existing sources of supply up to the new works.Running Costs.Creosote has been charged at 6 pence per gallon delivered at works. The heavy fraction, not processed, has been credited at  2 per tonne.The manufacturing cost is estimated at: 11-53 pence per gallon. This includes all factory costs, fees to I.H.P. -and factory overheads, but includes no capital charges for obsolescence, depreciation, amortisation, interest or profit, nor any fees to LCI.It is pointed out, however, that coal prices for next year show such an increase that approximately \d. per gallon should be added to the manu-facturing cost.
Changes in Basic Costs.Changes in basic costs have the following influence on the cost of petrol: Services.Distributed Power Coke Oven GasCoal ...

It is, however, desirable to recall certain conditions which would have to govern the operation of this plant if such were contemplated in the ordinary way of commerce.1. Under any licence granted by LCI. the qualities of the petrols produced must be subject to quota limitations which in their effect results in an average sharing in the premium and lower grades. That is to say, not more than about 25 per cent, could be premium grade spirit, and of this only a small fraction aviation.2. LCI. have drawn attention to the limitations of creosote supplies. A scheme such as the foregoing would have serious repercussions on the price of creosote. It would, therefore, be necessary for the Government to assure LCI. that their own commercial position would not be prejudiced by interference with the normal position of supply and demand.&quot;44. As such a plant would not be operated during peace time it would be necessary to provide for its care and maintenance. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., have furnished an estimate of the cost of providing for this which amounts to  18,000 per annum. The only other annual expense would be the interest on capital which at 4 cent, (see paragraph 311 of the Report) would be  120,000 and a fee to Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., for management.45. Using the same basis in regard to depreciation and obsolescence as has been adopted under the schemes in I and II, the following result is obtained : Pence per gallon.11-53      11-53 1-182-36 -91 -91Total costs of production     ...      13-62      14-8046. The present price (including the duty of 8d.) paid by the Air Ministry for aviation spirit is stated to be 19f   per gallon, delivered in road tank wagons.47. The Company were also asked if they would furnish estimates of the capital and other costs if! the plant referred to above were to be divided in two or three smaller plants, having the same total capacity, i.e., 100,000 tonnes per annum. The Committee considered that if this could be done, it would facilitate transport, and the dispersal of smaller plants would also give a greater measure of security from enemy attack.[16154] M 2Works cost (including works overheads) ... Depreciation at 5 per cent. Depreciation and obsolescence at 10 percent........      ...      ...      ...interest at 4 per cent.
48. The Company furnished the following estimates (the figures in respect of the 100,000 tonnes plant are repeated for ease of reference).	Single plant of 100,000 tonnes.	Two plants of 50,000 tonnes each.	Three plants of 33,000 tonnes each.

It will be seen that both the capital and manufacturing costs would be higher in the case of the smaller plants and it was also pointed out that although the Company found difficulty in advising as to obsolescence the charge in respect of the smaller plants would be higher on account of the higher capital involved. The cost of care and maintenance, which for the 100,000 tonnes plant was given as  18,000, would also be higher and might amount for the three plants to  25-30,000 per annum.50. The Company furnished particulars as to the number of men who would be required (a) to work the plants in full operation, and (b) for a care and maintenance party.   They are as follows : 	(&quot;) On the plant.	Technical Staff.	Total.	W On the plant. .Single plant	513	28	541	18Two plants	719	48	767	25Three plants	1,044	69	1,113	35Creosote plant to prodtice 140,000 tonnes of petrol per annum.51. After some further consideration of the creosote position, the Committee concluded that it might be possible in emergency to make available a total quantity of 200,000 tonnes per annum, and the Company were asked if they could furnish estimates for a plant to deal with this amount.52. The Committee were informed that a plant to deal with 200,000 tonnes of creosote per annum would produce 140,000 tonnes of petrol per annum. The capital cost, worked out on the same basis as for the 100,000 tonnes plant, would be  3,250,000 and  3,800,000, including certain services, respectively. The manufacturing cost in the case of the larger plant would be 11-2(2. per gallon.53. The services that would be required are in direct ratio to the 100,000 tonnes plant estimate, and would therefore be as follows : Producer and boiler coal... ... 123,700 tonnes per annum.Coke oven gas     ...      ... ... 5,680 cubic metres per hour.Electric power    ...      ... ... 17,160 kw.Clean water        ...      ... ... 312 cubic metres per hour.54. If it were considered desirable to have three smaller plants rather than one large one, the costs would be as follows : 	Single plant of 140,000 tonnes.	Three plants of 50,000 tonnes each.	 	 Cost of plant	3,250,000	4,875,000Total cost   ...       .;.       ...   &apos;   ...	3,800,000	5,745,000Manufacturing cost	11-20(7.	12-55(7.	per gallon.	per gallon.
Possibility of advertising plant to produce high octane fuel.55. The Committee discussed with the Company the possibility of using the plant for making high octane fuel should the use of 87 octane fuel by the Air Force be superseded during the next few years by 100 octane number.56. The Company, having examined the question, pointed out that it was not possible at that stage of their investigation to do more than give a very approximate estimate of outputs, and they were not prepared to work out detail cost figures.57. They also pointed out that their investigation on iso-octane, undertaken at the request of the Air Ministry, was not carried very far, as it soon became apparent that only small quantities could be manufactured at Billingham, and manufacturing costs would be high. Both features were unsatisfactory in comparison with the possibilities with fuel &quot;N&quot; (i.e., the fuel referred to in paragraph 296 of the Report).58. So far as fuel &quot; N &quot; is concerned, the pilot plant is now in operation and one of its purposes is the study of operating methods and costs.59. Subject to the limitation regarding costs, &amp;c, a number of alternative possibilities had been examined, and the most promising are detailed in the table annexed (Annex A). In these examples it has been assumed that the hydrogen production system remains unchanged throughout and operates at full capacity. To absorb this hydrogen necessitates increasing the original converter capacity for schemes 3 and 5.60. Apart from this, all the schemes would involve appreciable additional capital expenditure in installing the extra plants for iso-octane or fuel &quot; N.&quot; The gross annual running cost in each case would also exceed that in the case of the original scheme (shown in the table as Scheme 1). The particulars in the table are related to a plant for the production of 100,000 tonnes and should be proportionately increased for a plant of 140,000 tonnes capacity.61. While the foregoing represents the outcome of the Company&apos;s initial examination, they state that it is clear that further research might indicate developments which would enable the outputs, particularly of the iso-octane schemes, to be improved upon. It is also stated that in this event, or accepting fuel &quot; N &quot; as equally satisfactory with iso-octane, there is a reasonable technical possibility of developing the creosote scheme into a high octane fuel scheme.62. The Company subsequently informed the Committee that very recent researches indicate the possibility of producing directly by hydrogenation a fuel of 100 octane rating without blending with iso-octane provided up to 7 c.c.&apos;s per gallon of tetraethyl lead were permitted. The fuel has, so far, only been tested at Billingham, and the company are now arranging for tests to be made in an aero engine. Should these tests prove that the fuel will not reach 100 octane number, the Company state that it will still be valuable on account of its high anti-knock qualities. It will be possible by its use to provide a 100 octane fuel by mixing it with 20 per cent, of iso-octane, instead of 45 per cent, as is required in the case of a good petroleum spirit. In this event the permitted limit of 4 c.c.&apos;s of tetraethyl lead would not be exceeded.63. In regard to the development of the hydrogenation process in Germany, the particulars shown in Annex B have been furnished in strict confidence as a result of information supplied from trustworthy sources.

APPENDIX V. The Fischer Process.Historical.1. Dr. Franz Fischer, reading a Paper before the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fuel in December, 1930, which dealt with &quot; Benzine Synthesis from Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen at Ordinary Pressure,&quot; began by recalling that Professor Sabatier had in 1902 carried out certain experiments, and had hydro-genated carbon monoxide into methane by means of catalysts at ordinary pressure.. He pointed out that, in 1925, in collaboration with Dr. Tropsch, he had discovered that by using special catalysts the synthesis of higher aliphatic hydrocarbons could be carried out instead of the synthesis of methane. These experiments were continued for a number of years in the laboratory.2. In November, 1934 the first experimental semi-commercial plant, with a capacity of 1,000 tons of mixed hydrocarbons per annum, commenced operations. The plant was erected at Oberhausen-Holten by the Ruhrchemie A.G., a concern which was founded by the Ruhr coal, steel and iron interests to operate a chemical industry in conjunction with the coal industry.3. In 1935, the Ruhrbenzin A.G., a subsidiary of Ruhrchemie, was formed with a capital of RM. 4^ million, further funds being provided by a medium term bank advance of RM. 9 million, and it was proposed to erect an installation for the production of 25,000 tons of light motor fuel per annum, which could be increased to 75,000 tons in the event of success in the smaller plant.4. In October, 1935, a party of scientists from this country, including a representative of the Fuel Research Station, visited Germany in order to inspect the work being done on the Fischer process. At that time there were only two plants in operation, viz., the experimental plant at Holten and a unit converter with a capacity of 1,000 tons per annum at the Rauxel Works of Gerwerkshaft Victor, which had then just commenced operations.5. The first commercial scale plant was erected at Holten in 1936 by Ruhrbenzin A.G. This plant had a capacity of 30,000 tons of crude products per annum and commenced production in August, 1936.6. Work on synthesis of hydrocarbons from mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen has been carried out at the Fuel Research Station during the past three years. In addition to the study of the technique of the process for the production of the direct primary product, one of the chief objects has been to examine the nature of the lubricating oils which can be prepared by the polymerisation of the primary product. A pilot plant capable of treating 100 cubic feet per hour of synthesis gas is in continuous operation. Attention is being directed to the modification of the conditions and the nature of the reactions. Certain aspects of the process and, in particular, the purification of water gas from organic sulphur compounds, were investigated at the Fuel Research Station as long ago as 1926. Two processes for the manufacture of synthesis gas from British coal in a full-scale water gas plant have been evolved.Description of Process.7. The process consists in the conversion of so-called &quot; synthesis gas &quot; a mixture of 1 volume of carbon monoxide and 2 volumes of hydrogen into an oil product. The starting material may be either coal or coke. If coke is used, it is treated in a water gas plant for.the production of water gas, which is then converted to &quot; synthesis gas.&quot; If coal is used as the starting material, it is first coked in coke ovens in the normal way. The coke is employed for the production of water gas. The coke oven gas is decomposed to help to provide the &apos;&apos; synthesis gas.&quot; Semi-coke and low . temperature carbonisation gases can be used in a similar manner. It is also claimed that bituminous coal can be gasified direct in a water gas plant and the gas subsequently treated to provide synthesis gas, but this method has not yet been proved on a commercial scale.8. In order that the main catalytic process may be carried out efficiently, it is first necessary to remove sulphuretted hydrogen from the gas and then to treat
it for the removal of organic sulphur compounds. For this purpose the gas is passed through towers, containing a catalyst, maintained at a temperature between 2000 and 3000 C. The gas is then taken at atmospheric pressure through the main reaction chambers containing the catalyst, for conversion to hydrocarbon products. The actual reaction temperature at which the synthesis is effected is between 180o and 210o C, and the temperature must be controlled within narrow limits. The reaction chambers are so designed that the large amount of heat generated in the reaction is removed and utilised. On leaving the reaction chamber, the gas is cooled, the higher-boiling products are condensed, and the more volatile products are absorbed on active charcoal from which they are subsequently recovered.9. The product obtained from the synthesis of the gas is known as the primary product and consists of gaseous, liquid and solid hydrocarbons. This primary product has to be further treated to obtain the final commercial products. The liquid primary product which forms the bulk of the yield can be distilled to give motor spirit, diesel oil and soft and hard wax, or it can be cracked to produce mainly motor spirit.10. According to present information, the motor spirit produced by this process is not of&apos;a high grade, but it is claimed that, by cracking, it can be considerably improved, though the yield is reduced. It is also claimed that a good diesel oil and lubricating oils can be made, and it has recently been stated that an aviation spirit has been produced.11. There is no official information available in this country, other than from the operations of laboratory scale plants, regarding the working of the Fischer process as there is no plant at present in operation. The Committee have, however, been supplied with information by various witnesses who have been granted facilities to visit plants in Germany, some of whom have also carried out tests on samples of the primary product supplied from Germany, for the purpose of ascertaining the type and quantity of finished products it is possible to obtain!12. The Committee took evidence from Colonel Appleyard, Sir Stephenson Kent (Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd.) and Lord Cadman and Mr. W. Fraser (Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ltd.) representing the three interests referred to in paragraphs 174 to 176 of the Report. The first two witnesses were accompanied by their technical advisers. In addition, evidence was taken from Sir Harold Hartley (Chairman of the Fuel Research Board, and also interested generally in scientific and technical advancement); Sir Frank Smith (Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research); Dr. Sinnatt (Director of Fuel Research in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research); Sir Alfred Faulkner (Under-Secretary for Mines), and Sir Alexander Walker (Distillers&apos; Co., Ltd.), whose company has given consideration to the Fischer process as a means of supplying raw materials for the production of chemical products. The Committee were also supplied with a report made to the Nuffield Trustees by Dr. Rosin, a German technologist, now resident in this country.iSize of Plant and Capital Cost.13. Statements were furnished to the Committee setting out particulars relating to the recommended size of plant, estimates of the capital and operating costs, the type and yield of products it is claimed can be produced, and estimated realisation value of the products, &amp;c.   This information is summarised below : 14. Several views were expressed as to the most suitable size of plant which should be installed in the first instance. The matter is one which depends to a material extent on such factors as the arrangements for the manufacture and purification of the catalyst, the method to be adopted for refining the primary product; and the scale of operations which is to be contemplated. Provided suitable arrangements can be made for the provision and periodical purification of the catalyst, and for cracking or otherwise refining the primary product, it is apparently the view of Ruhrchemie that plants with a capacity of from 25,000/ 30,000 tons could be regarded as economic units. It seemed to be generally agreed by witnesses, however, that for a self-contained unit, which could economically provide for the manufacture and periodical purification of the catalyst required, and have its own refining and cracking plant, the capacity should not be less than [16154] N
60,000 tons per annum of primary product. On the question of what was the smallest plant that would be likely to produce data to determine the suitability of the process in this country the view was expressed that while a pilot plant of 1,000 tons capacity, such as had first been erected in Germany, might produce useful technical information, such information might give no guide to the economics of the process and there would be no commercial incentive in such a venture. It was, therefore, considered that the smallest unit which should be contemplated was one of 20,000 tons capacity. Such a plant would not only provide valuable technical and economic data, but it would enable the nucleus of a staff to be trained which would be available when a larger production was required, and would provide facilities for large scale research to be carried out. It would be also of great assistance in planning further plants if the national interest called for them or commercial concerns desired at any time to establish this type of process.15. The following are examples of the sizes of plant and estimates of capital cost admitted to the Committee : I. 20,000 ton plant (including coke ovens) ...       1 million to  1^- million 11.-35,000 ton plant (A) Including coke ovens    ......  1,901,000(B) Direct gasification of coal in watergas plant        .........  1,717,000III. 60,000 ton plant (including coke ovensand distillation plant) ......  3,100,00016. The estimates of cost have been prepared at different dates, based on information supplied by Ruhrchemie. There is some difficulty in translating costs prepared in Germany to conditions in this country, and it is doubtful whether the figures quoted above have allowed for increases in costs of materials which have taken place during the past year or so. This point is referred to in the extract from the letter from the Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd., quoted in paragraph 19.17. In the course of the statement which he submitted to the Committee, Colonel Appleyard said that he had been studying the possibility of using cannel coal in connection with the Fischer process, and he had come to the conclusion that as a commercial proposition, cannel was very far ahead of anything yet worked out, using coke as a raw material.He subsequently informed the Committee as follows : &quot; I have studied the possibility of an installation to utilise this cannel coal, and have satisfied myself that it is suitable for conversion into motor spirit by carrying out a primary distillation of the cannel, utilising the residual cannel coke for steam raising purposes, converting the gas into primary products by means of the Fischer process, and converting cannel tar by known distillation methods.Financially, this presents a much more attractive proposition than any other scheme that I have yet studied, and the capital cost of a 60,000 tons per annum plant is only a little over half the capital cost of a similar plant utilising bituminous coal as the original material.&quot;18. Colonel Appleyard is apparently satisfied that it would be possible within two or three years to obtain sufficient supplies of cannel coal to make the scheme practicable, and, provided the Government are prepared to guarantee a sufficient measure of assistance, he anticipates that arrangements will be possible to secure the erection of a plant.19. Reference is made in paragraphs 194 and 195 of the Report to the question of the amount of Government assistance, whether by way of a guaranteed preference or provision of capital, which would be necessary in order to secure the development on a commercial&apos; scale of the Fischer process. As is there indicated Messrs. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd., at first suggested that the Government should find 75 per cent, of the capital cost, and the remaining 25 per cent, should be found by themselves, together with other concerns which
might be interested. The following is an extract from the letter sent to the Committee by the Company after their representatives had given verbal evidence: &quot; We have been giving the most careful consideration to this problem, and reluctantly have come to the conclusion that, owing to the impossibility to-day and, so far as one can judge, at any reasonably near date, of ascertaining costs of materials for construction, no proposal with a sufficient foundation in fact can be put forward which could satisfy the Treasury or attract outside investors.It may or may not be within the knowledge of your Committee that, at the moment, it is almost impossible to secure a reasonable estimation of the cost of materials, and it is with even greater difficulty that one can secure an offer of materials. Furthermore, such an offer when made is of such a prohibitive character that commercial work requiring steel and such other engineering materials is at a standstill, except where the need is so urgent that expense has to be ignored. Moreover, a date for delivery is of the most approximate character, and is hedged about with every conceivable qualifica-tion. That being the case, to my regret I find I can make no suggestion that in any degree meets the terms required by your Chairman.Nevertheless, it may be that in the opinion of the Committee it is in the national and perhaps in the depressed areas&apos; interests, that progressive steps should be taken in this matter of oil from coal. If that is so, your Committee might think it well to consider whether it would not be to the advantage of those interests for the Government to purchase a licence for the Fischer-Tropsch Process. The licence could be for the smallest possible unit, which I should imagine might be in the nature of a 20,000-35,000 ton plant. If the Ruhrchemie basis of purchase price is unchanged, such a licence would cost approximately  75,000. Following possession of the licence, all the facts in regard to the plants that now operate in Germany would be at the disposal of the owner of the licence. The necessary study could be given, specifica-tions and designs, &amp;c, could be prepared with little delay.Then again, in a state of national urgency, or a recurrence of unemploy-ment in the depressed areas, construction and operation of the plant could be set on foot with but little delay compared to that which would arise if negotiations for a licence, specifications, designs, &amp;c, had then, to be undertaken.If such a course commended itself to your Committee and to the Govern-ment, my Company would be prepared to participate in the purchase of such a licence.&quot;20. On the other hand, Colonel Appleyard, in a revised statement submitted after he had given evidence, was of the opinion that, provided the Government guaranteed a preference of 8d. a gallon for not less than 12 years, it would be possible to raise the necessary capital among his financial and industrial associates for a plant of 20,000 tons annual capacity.Products and Yields.21. It is stated that the yield of products largely depends on the coal or coke used and the method of preparing the synthesis gas.22. The Committee were at first informed that the only guarantee Ruhrchemie were prepared to give was that from one cubic metre of synthesis gas not less than 115 grammes of crude primary product could be produced. Subsequently, the Committee were told by Colonel Appleyard, following a- visit by him to Germany, that owing to improvements which have been made he was informed that a figure of 143 grammes had been reached, and that the technicians who are designing the Fischer plants are satisfied that 140 grammes per cubic metre of synthesis gas is a safe figure to work on.23. The Committee have not found it possible, as in other processes, to obtain any data as to the probable quantities of refined products which could be obtained from a given quantity of coal or synthesis gas, as a great deal would depend on the product it was mainly desired to obtain. For instance, it would be possible to run the plant primarily for the production of diesel oil, in which case the petrol yield would be smaller, or, on the other hand, if it were desirable to [16154] N 2
obtain the maximum quantity of the light hydrocarbons, it would be necessary to crack some of the heavier fraction, and the production of diesel oil would be less.24. Statements giving the yields it is claimed can be obtained, together with the estimated value of the products, have been submitted, and two such statements are set out below.Estimated yield of products from a plant producing 35,000 tons of Primary Product per annum.Product.                    i	Estimated	Estimated	Estimated Value	Quantity.	realised Price.	at Works.Liquefiable Gases Light Petrol (up to 140oC.)      ......

(Revenue from this pays cost of revivi-			fying and making good loss of catalyst)				62,400		888,282These two statements show widely differing results, both on yields and proceeds of the several products.25.   Information regarding the possible yields was also supplied by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., Ltd., who carried out tests on two samples of Fischer. crude oil which were stated by Ruhrchemie to be representative samples of the total production from the commercial plant.26. The samples were tested with the object of estimating the yields of finished products under the following conditions :  (a) For maximum production of (1) 65 octane motor spirit; (2) 74 octane motor spirit.(b) For maximum production of high-speed diesel oil, together with theproduction of  -1) 65 octane motor spirit; 2) 74 octane motor spirit.
27. The following table shows the result of me tests (all the percentages shown are by weight of the crude oil unless otherwise stated) : 	Spirit Production only.

The Committee were supplied with several estimates of the cost of production, which again differ materially.29. In relation to the 60,000 tons per annum plant shown above, it is estimated that the average cost of production of finished liquid products would be 6 - 9(2. per gallon, allowing depreciation at 7 per cent, on the portion of the capital representing the cost of the plant, but before providing interest on capital; while in respect of the 35,000 tons per annum plant the cost of production was given as from Is. 0f(2. to Is. 3d. per gallon, according to the period allowed for amortisation of capital which ranged from 10 to 20 years.30. Another estimate submitted to the Committee was based on crediting the yields of petrol, diesel oil, &amp;c, obtained from a sample of the primary product with the current market value of a similar product of a high grade. The average realisation figure arrived at was 12-75(2. per gallon, and from this was deducted 2-25(2. for refining costs, amortisation, interest, &amp;c, leaving a works cost of 10-5c2. per gallon.Terms of Licence.31. A draft licence which was furnished to the Committee is given in Annex A.The terms quoted by Ruhrchemie appear to be not only exorbitant, but quite divorced from the usual routine connected with acquiring patented process rights.The financial terms are not given in the draft licence, but the Committee were informed that, in respect of a plant of 50,000 tons per annum of primary product, these were as follows : For a preliminary option, the sum of Em. 200,000 ( 16,300).If the option is exercised, a sum of Rm. 1,900,000 ( 154,000) is payable (the sum of  16,300 above is credited against this, leaving a further net payment of  137,700).32. In the event of the plant being extended above 50,000 tons, or the establishment of new plants, a royalty, calculated on the basis of Rm. 19 per ton year of annual plant capacity, would be charged on the excess quantity, subject to a reduction of 10 per cent, in the third year and further 10 per cents, in each subsequent year of the licence period.
33. Thus, applied to a plant or plants producing 150,000 tons per annum, the total licence fee would be  308,000 made up as follows :  For the option .........      ......        16,300For the 50,000-ton plant      ............      137,700For the additional 100,000 tons at Em. 19 per tonyear ..................      154,000308,00034. The Committee were informed that a licence might be granted for a plant with a capacity as small as 10,000 tons per annum, but the Royalty would be higher per ton than for larger plants, and as smaller plants were relatively more costly in capital outlay than larger plants, Ruhrchemie were not anxious to encourage the construction of small plants. It was also suggested that both the terms and conditions of the licence could probably be modified in serious negotiations, although the fact that these terms had been accepted in other countries might give rise to difficulty.Patent Position.35. The Committee enquired as to the patents held by Ruhrchemie, and were informed by several witnesses that, with the exception of the one relating to the process for the removal of sulphur, the Fischer patents were of little value, as there had been previous disclosure in technical journals, &amp;c. It is considered, however, that the practical experience that has been gained by their operations on full-scale plants is of great value. They have also, it is stated, made considerable improvements in both the quality of the products and in technique, and it is probable that these improvements are covered by patents which have not been disclosed.Time needed for the constmction of a plant.36. From the information that has been supplied, it would appear that, under present conditions, it would take about two years to erect a plant (even of 20,000 tons capacity) in this country.Employment.37. Estimates of the number of workpeople that would be employed have been given, and, taking the same size plants as were taken before, i.e., 35,000 tons and 60,000 tons, the estimates are as follows : Size of Plant. 60,000 tons. 35,000 tons.Scheme 1.    Scheme 2.To provide coal.........      1,000 758 750To work the plant and coke ovens, &amp;c..........        228 280 200Total       ......      1,228*        1,038 950There would also be a number of people employed permanently in secondary industries and temporarily on the manufacture and construction of the plants.Development of the Fischer Process.38. As regards the development of the Fischer process in Germany and other countries, the statement shown in Annex B was supplied by one witness in strict confidence from information which he had been able to secure in Germany.* Plus office and technical staff.
ANNEX A.Copy of Draft Licence.. Paragraph 1.ACCORDING to an Agreement, made by contract with the Studien- und Verwertungs-gesellschaft m. b.,H, Mtilheim-Ruhr (Study and Exploitation Company) and with Privy Councillor Professor Dr. Fischer, Mulheim-Ruhr, Ruhrchemie have for disposal the experiences obtained by many years&apos; development work in connection with the technical production of hydrocarbons from water-gas, or of mixtures of gas similar to water-gas.Ruhrchemie have, furthermore, developed a process in their own experimental plants, to such an extent that also in technical operation the production of hydrocarbons from water-gas, or a mixture of gas similar to water-gas, has been made possible. The process in question is termed in the following the &quot; Fischer Process.&quot; The practical experiments have shown that from (one) 1 normal cbm. of Gas, which contains Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen in the relations of 1:2 and does not contain more than 5 per cent, of inerts, 110 grams of primary products are created (of this about 90 grams of Benzine and Oil, 5 grams of Hard Paraffin, 15 grams Propane and Butane). The proportions of these quantities can differ from each other to the extent of up to 5 per cent.From these products, which are, under normal conditions, liquid or solid, normal Motor-Car Benzine can be produced by processes which the Ruhrchemie is prepared to transmit, and the results of which are guai-anteed by the respective constructional firmsThe primary product can also partly be turned into Diesel Oil, Paraffin and Benzine. Also for these processes the advice of the Ruhrchemie is available.Paragraph 2.The expression &apos;&apos; Fischer Process &apos;&apos; used in this Agreement embraces in general: -  Processes for the synthetic production of saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons in the form of gas, liquids or solids, inclusive of the lower boiling combinations of the Methane series, as also inclusive of the light oils and paraffins and the other products and/or combinations which are formed directly in the process, as far as all these enumerated materials can be produced by conducting gas mixtures containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen over catalysts at increased temperatures and at normal, slightly increased or reduced pressure.The expression &quot; Fischer Process &quot; also includes the methods for purification of the gassy mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen as far as these are to be used in connection with the above-described catalytic process. Furthermore is included the. production and regeneration of the catalysts used for the synthesis and regeneration of the catalysts used for the synthesis and purification.To the &quot; Fischer Process &quot; further belongs also the recovery of the primary products obtained with the catalytic process, no matter whether it is obtained by separation and/or absorption and/or adsorption.Finally, in the meaning of the &quot;Fischer Process &quot; are included all apparatus and parts of construction and/or details and/or single parts which are necessary for the purification of the gases, also for the carrying out of the synthesis. Furthermore, for the production of the catalysts and for the recovery of the primary products.Paragraph 3.&quot; X &quot; obtains from the Ruhrchemie and the Ruhrchemie grants &quot; X &quot; a simple licence for .... for the &quot; Fischer Process &quot; for the erection and operation of a complete plant, with which up to ... . tons of primary products can be produced per year. Under primary products are understood the products which result directly from the contact chambers of the Fischer Synthesis. The fixing of the capacity is, therefore, to be based upon the directly produced quantities of Benzine, Oils as also Paraffin and Gasol.For operating technical reasons, the Ruhrchemie grants &quot; X &quot; a tolerance of 10 per cent, upon the stated capacities.Ruhrchemie has the right, during the term of the Agreement, after getting into contact with &quot; X,&quot; to investigate at any suitable period at &quot; X &quot; whether the production has not been increased.Paragraph 4.For the acquisition of a Simple Licence, &quot;X&quot; pays the Ruhrchemie the amount of Rm.....Of this amount Rm.....are to be paid when signing this Agreement.   Further Rm.....are to be paid when the test provided for in Paragraph 5 of this Agreement has been completed and the correctness of the yield figures mentioned in Paragraph 1 has been proved.    Theremaining Rm.....are to be paid in instalments each of Rm.....and the first instalmentis due one year, and the second instalment two years, &amp;c, from the date&apos; when this Agreement has come finally into force.All amounts are to be paid in Foreign Currency, if the German Reichsbank demands it.Further, the payment of the Licence Fee has to be made without any deduction or discount for any present or future Taxes and other payments which may be levied by the Government or any other Governmental Department or Tax Office of the Country of the Licensee. In the event of the Licensee being compelled by Law to deduct such taxes, for which he cannot legally be responsible or made to pay, from payments which he has to make in accordance with the Licence Agreement, then he is obliged to increase immediately the amount of his payments in
such a way that, after the deduction or retention of payment of the corresponding amounts oi taxes or other public and legal payments, the net amounts in no case remain below the amounts fixed by this Agreement.Paragraph 5.This Agreement will come into&apos;final effect when, after the checking of the figures given by the Ruhrchemie in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement, regarding the Fischer Process, by Experts to be designated by &quot; X &quot; and who are to be acceptable to the Ruhrchemie, the correctness of the figures has been ascertained.The term of testing is to be agreed upon with Ruhrchemie and can be demanded by Ruhrchemie within a period of 2 (two) months after the signing of this Agreement, when technical contact chambers for the carrying out of the test and for ascertaining the figures stated are available. If, in spite of the demand by Ruhrchemie, &quot;X&quot; does not carry out the checking within the limited period, the Agreement becomes finally effective without the examination.The examination is to extend over 7 (seven) successive days.   Ruhrchemie is obliged, afterpayment of the first instalment of Rm....., to make it possible for the checking of the FischerProcess by Experts to be designated by &quot; X &quot; at a plant operating in Germany.The amount of Rm.....paid will then also be forfeited, if this Agreement is not put intoactual effect.Paragraph 6.After payment of the second instalment of Rm.....the Ruhrchemie has to put at thedisposal of &quot; X &quot; all experiences, constructions, plans, drawings, statements and calculations which are of importance for the construction of the plant, as also for the operation of same, with the exception of those, by the publication of which the rights of third parties may be affected.For the preparation of drawings, plans and special calculations, &quot; X &quot; pays the cost of the work done by the constructional engineers, &amp;c. When requested, the Ruhrchemie will send one or more competent expert Engineers, who are to assist &quot; X &quot; in the construction, installation or operation of the plant. &quot; X &quot; is to pay Ruhrchemie the cost of first-class journeys and living expenses for every engineer so placed at disposal and &quot; X &quot; have to pay an additional amount of 25 per cent, upon the actual salary paid by the Ruhrchemie to such Engineers, everything calculated for the period spent by the Engineers at the request of &quot; X &quot; outside the seat of the Ruhrchemie.Paragraph 7.Ruhrchemie also places at the disposal of &quot; X &quot; all the Patents running in .... of this Process, or the Patent Applications made, as also those inventions which are applied for in the course of the first year of the Agreement and for the term of the validity of these Patents.Furthermore, the Ruhrchemie transfers to &quot; X &quot; for the term of the Agreement, all experiences and protective rights which are created during the term of the Agreement, as also the whole of the protective rights and experiences which are placed at the disposal of the Ruhrchemie by their other Licensees.Paragraph 8.&quot; X &quot; undertakes not to export from .... the products made according to the &quot; Fischer Process &quot; and also, if necessary, those products obtained by further treatment. &quot; X &quot; has also to bind their Purchasers not to export the products and, in the event of a fault in this respect becoming known, to stop the supply of material to these clients.In a reverse way, the Ruhrchemie undertakes, when granting further Licences, to make it a condition to their Licensees, with the exception of the German Licensees, that the products made by the &quot; Fischer Process,&quot; as also the products obtained by further treatment, are not imported into districts for which this Licence Agreement is valid, unless a definite understanding has been arrived at in every case between the parties of these agreements.Paragraph 9.&quot;. X &quot; undertake to refrain from any operation or acts in connection with plants, &amp;c,covered by the Agreement for the duration of ... . years outside.....&quot; X &quot; is, therefore,not entitled during this period to erect or operate plants which would be operated according to the Fischer Process outside the defined districts.&quot; X &quot; has to respect and to treat confidentially the property rights of Ruhrchemie, all confidential information, constructions, plans, drawings, specifications and calculations in regard to the &quot;Fischer Process&quot; and/or apparatus usable in connection therewith. &quot;X&quot; must also not use in any other manner such statements so made by the Ruhrchemie, or allow them to be used by other parties than is permissible in accordance with the conditions of this Agreement.When granting licences to other countries, Ruhrchemie will do everything possible to protec&apos;&apos;. the Licence granted to &quot;X.&quot;Paragraph 10.For the legal validity and for the maintenance of the protection rights in ... . Ruhrchemie take no responsibility.When the existing or applied for protection rights are assailed, then it remains for &quot; X &quot; to take the necessary measures of resistance. Ruhrchemie undertake, at the request of &quot; X,&quot; to obtain all necessary signatures and to take steps for combating such attacks. The whole costs of such a process are to be borne by &quot;X,&quot; who are also to make the necessary advance payments.Also on an infringement of the Patent Rights of the Ruhrchemie, it remains for &quot; X &quot; to initiate the required measures.   Also in this case, Ruhrchemie undertake to obtain the necessary
2 6 jsignatures and to take suitable measures at the request of &quot;X.&quot; The costs also in this case are to be wholly borne by &quot;X,&quot; -who have to make the necessary advance payments.In the event of &quot; X &quot; getting into difficulties in carrying out the &quot; Fischer Process,&quot; due to infringements of patent rights of third parties, the Ruhrchemie undertake to give the necessary assistance to &quot;X.&quot; The costs incurred by doing so are, however, to be borne by &quot; X,&quot; and &quot; X &quot; has also to bear the whole of the costs which are entailed in such a process.Paragraph 11.Any disputes and differences of opinion which arise in connection with this Agreement between the Parties are, if they cannot be satisfactorily removed by mutual agreement, to be decided by a Court of Arbitration, with the exclusion of the ordinary legal process.This Court of Arbitration will be composed of three arbitrators, one of whom is each selected by the two parties of this Agreement. . If, after 30 (thirty) days from the date of the demand made by one of the parties for the appointment of an arbitrator, the other party has not appointed an arbitrator, then the President of the Industrie- und Handelskammer (Industrial and Commercial Chamber) in Berlin will appoint an arbitrator in their place. The two arbitrators so appointed then select a third arbitrator. If this is not done by them within 30 (thirty) days, then the third arbitrator is appointed by the President of the Industrie- und Handelskammer in Berlin.The Arbitrators must be wholly unbiased and must in no way be interested in the matter for which they have to give a decision.The Court of Arbitration has to endeavour to accelerate the proceedings and, for this reason, is entitled to put upon the parties certain appropriate time limits, and also limits for the declaration in writing. It is also entitled, but not obliged, to arrange verbal negotiations. Verbal negotiations must take place if one of the parties demands same.The majority decision of the Court of Arbitration is binding and final to the two parties of this Agreement. The costs of the Court of Arbitration process are to be borne equally by the two parties irrespective of the judgment given. Equally, the payments advanced to meet the costs are to be made by both parties of equal amounts and without unreasonable delay.The proceedings before the Court of Arbitration are regulated generally in accordance with the rules of the 10th Book of the German Civil Process order. The appropriate court in the sense of the Paragraph 1045 ff. is the Landgericht, Duisburg.Paragraph 12.All declarations, demands, &amp;c, which become necessary on the interpretation of this Agreement are considered to be properly delivered to the Ruhrchemie if they are forwarded per Registered Letter with the proper amount of postage paid, addressed to: -Ruhrchemie Aktiengesellschaft, Oberhausen-Holten, Germany.or have been addressed to the party which, by advice in writing, has been given to &quot; X &quot; by /the- Ruhrchemie. On the other hand, the transmission to &quot; X &quot; is acknowledged to have been properly performed if they are sent per Registered Letter, and with sufficient postage, to the address given by this Company.Paragraph 13.The rights resulting from this Agreement cannot be disposed of by any of the Parties interested therein. The sale or transfer is permitted to the legal successor, if he practically takes over the whole property and seat of the business.Paragraph 14.This Agreement is concluded for the period of ... . years.Ruhrchemie undertake, however, after the lapse of this number of ... . years to permit &quot;X&quot; to continue the condition of the Agreement and on terms which correspond to the reduced value of the existing Patents and of those which are no longer available to &quot; X &quot; under the provision of this Agreement. If no agreement can be reached by the two parties regarding the conditions of the continuation of this Agreement, then the Court of Arbitration provided for in Paragraph 11 is to make a decision.Paragraph 15.The relations between the parties to each other, resulting from this Agreement, are to be subject to the German Law.The cost of Stamps and all other public and legal fees, &amp;c, for putting this Agreement into effect are to be borne by &quot;X.&quot;

INTRODUCTION.1. The Committee were appointed by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence on the 26th April last &apos;&apos; To consider and examine the various processes for the production of oil from coal and certain other materials indigenous to this country, and to report on their economic possibilities, and on the advantages to be obtained by way of security of oil supplies in emergency.&quot;2. In order that the Committee might discharge their terms of reference, they have found it necessary to cover a wide field of investigation, involving, besides an enquiry into the various processes for obtaining oil from coal, shale, &amp;c, the consideration of the needs of this country for oil supplies, in peace time and in emergency, together with the means which are or can be employed to meet those needs.8. The Committee have heard the evidence of a number of witnesses of very varied experience and opinions. They have examined representatives of those Government departments which are concerned with the general questions of supply of oil for civil and industrial needs, with meeting the requirements of the Service departments, and with scientific research.4. On the production and supply side, the Committee have had the opportunity of hearing the views of prominent members of the Oil, Coal, Gas, Shale Oil, Coke Oven and Low Temperature Carbonisation industries. The Committee were able to visit the coal-petrol Hydrogenation plant of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., at Billingham, and have discussed the hydrogenation process with various representatives of the Company both at the works and in London.5. Accompanied by their technical advisers, the management of certain important commercial concerns, who have been considering the possible development in this country of the Fischer, or similar processes, have given evidence and have furnished the Committee with much valuable information and data.6. All the witnesses, without exception, have been most helpful, and the Committee desire to place on record their deep appreciation of the services and the most valuable assistance they rendered.7. All relevant information available in the Mines Department, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (including the Fuel Research Station), and in the offices of the Committee of Imperial Defence connected with the work of other committees, has been placed at the disposal of the Committee, and, as a result, the Committee&apos;s investigations have been much facilitated.8. The Committee visited the Fuel Research Station at Greenwich and saw the work which is being carried out there, including that in connection with the hydrogenation of coal (generally known as the Bergius process), the hydrogenation of tar and the production of oil by the synthesis of gases (the basis of the Fischer and Synthetic Oils, Ltd., processes).9. The Committee gave careful consideration to the question how they ought to interpret the phrase &apos;&apos; the various processes&apos;&apos; in their terms of reference. They decided that it was not practicable for them to investigate every variation of a main process brought to their notice. The variations, particularly in the case of the low tempera-agriculture carbonisation process, differ from one another only on technical points which have no material effect on the quantities of the oil products obtained. Nor did the Committee consider that they could investigate the claims put forward in respect of a number of processes which have not been developed beyond the laboratory stage.
10. Commenting to the Committee on this question, Sir Frank Smith, Secretary to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, remarked as follows: -&quot;&quot;-It is desirable to be quite clear that the yields and ease of working of any process involving heat treatment of coal cannot be proved by experiments on a laboratory scale. The rate at which the coal is heated, and the rate at which the volatile products are removed, have a considerable effect on the products obtained. These rates are necessarily affected by the bulk of the coal being treated, i.e., by the size of the plant.&quot;11. It is clearly not practicable, therefore, to determine the economic possibilities of processes which are only in an early stage of development. The Committee are satisfied that in the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research, arrangements already exist under which, in promising cases, technical help and even a measure of financial assistance can be given to enable a new process to be tried out, provided that the issue is of sufficient national importance. Having examined several cases in which the Govern-ment departments concerned have been criticised for not giving such assistance on the basis of claims made by inventors and owners of processes, the Committee are satisfied that there is no justification for these criticisms. There is no doubt in their minds that a very sympathetic attitude is shown in the consideration of these new developments.12. The Committee have dealt with this matter at this early stage of their Report because it arises out of the consideration of their terms of reference, and it enables them to explain what their procedure has been and their reasons for adopting it.18. Having thus reviewed the matter, the Committee decided to regard the phrase &quot; the various processes &quot; as meaning the several broad categories of processes available for obtaining oil from materials indigenous to this country, such as those concerned with (1) the production of oil from shale, (2) the production of benzole and tar and tar products at gas works and coke ovens, (8) low temperature carbonisation, and (4) hydrogenation and synthetic processes. Each of these categories has been carefully reviewed by the Committee.14. The importance of oil in the national economy of all the leading countries is very great. World production of crude petroleum has increased during this century from about 20 million tons in 1900 to 245 million tons in 1986, or practically twelve-fold. Consumption is still steadily growing and this country is the third largest consumer, coming next to the two largest oil-producing countries, viz., the United States of America and Russia.15. It can be no matter of surprise, therefore, that, as the Secretary for Mines remarked in the House of Commons when announcing the appointment of the Committee, &quot; the possibility of obtaining substantial supplies of oil from coal has excited much public interest.&quot;16. If this much desired result could be obtained with any reasonable degree of economy man)- advantages of great national importance would arise. But it is not possible to obtain a correct picture of the contribution which oil produced from materials indigenous to this country can make, whether under the two entirely different conditions of peace or war, without taking into account certain severely practical considerations, the chief of which have been -examined by the Committee and are dealt with in the subsequent Sections of the Report.17. Part of the public interest referred to is no doubt due to the knowledge that big develojiments are talcing place elsewhere in the production of oil from solid materials. Germany has embarked on -a general policy of self-sufficiency, and part of that policy consists in a great programme for the building of plants to manufacture oil from coal. The policy of Germany in this respect is one of much interest, but it does not appear to the Committee that, because Germany has thought fit to undertake her great programme, this country should necessarily follow that policy. The economic and natural factors of oil supply in this country and in Germany are
different, and there are several technical conditions, such as the existence of extensive deposits of German brown coal, &amp;c, which are not similar to those found in Great Britain. But there is no doubt that such experience in certain respects can be of assistance to this country, and the Committee have carefully considered the information available.18. Oil from coal plants are being established in certain other countries, but on a much smaller scale.19. An immense amount of thought and scientific activity is being expended in this country and elsewhere on the subject, and no one can doubt the importance of following the technical developments which are continuously taking place. It is interesting to recall that the last Royal Commission on the Coal Industry, which reported hardly more than ten years ago^ could say very little of a definite character about the hydrogenation process, so recent are these developments. The process as applied to the treatment of coal and coal tar oils has now been technically proved, and it is used in the petroleum industry for the commercial treatment of certain crude oils and the manufacture of special products.20.   The Report is divided into the following Sections : Section    I. The  position  in  regard   to  natural  oil supplies.Section   II.- The production of oil from home sources.Section III. The economic aspect of the home produc-tion of oil.Section IV. The position in time of war. Section   V. Recommendations. Appendices.Section I.THE POSITION IN REGARD TO NATURAL OIL SUPPLIES.21. The proved supplies of petroleum, which are for all practical purposes the only source of supply of oil fuels and lubricating oils, are very unevenly distributed geographically. During recent years just over 80 per cent, of the world&apos;s production has been obtained in three countries, U.S.A. with 60 per cent., Russia with about 11 per cent, and Venezuela with about 9 per cent. There are only seven countries with a production in excess of 5 million tons per annum, and out of a total world production of 245 million tons in 1936, these seven countries accounted for 226 million tons. A Table showing world production of crude oil is given in Appendix I, Table 1.22. All the important nations of the world, except the U.S.A. and Russia, are dependent mainly on imported supplies to meet their needs for petroleum products.28. The crude petroleums from the various oilfields of the world are not a uniform substance, but present marked differences in characteristics. Some crudes on distillation furnish small quantities of light products and a large proportion of heavy or fuel oils. Some are not suitable for the production of lubricating oils, and others produce little or no spirit suitable for aviation purposes. It is the business of the oil industry, by the adoption of various methods of refining and blending, to produce that balance of products or &quot; fractions &quot; which is necessary to meet the demands of the market. Quantitatively, the two most important products are motor spirit and fuel oil. Besides these products there are kerosene,, gas oil and light diesel oil, lubricating oil and diesel oil of a heavier character.24. In those countries like Great Britain where road transport is highly developed, motor spirit is the most important product from the point of view of quantity and, excepting aviation spirit and high grade lubricating oils, also from the point of view of price.
25. With the development of compression-ignition engines for use in motor transport, the importance of gas oil and light diesel oil is growing, although it seems unlikely that for many years it can reach the position which motor spirit now occupies. As against a consumption in 1986 of over 1,800 million gallons of motor spirit in this country, the consumption of road diesel oil was about 44 million gallons.26. Kerosene, which in some countries, such as Russia, India and China, is still very important, is not used in this country in anything like the same proportion as was formerly the case, although the quantities are substantial.27. Lubricating oils are of vital importance to any industrial country. About half a million tons per annum., are used in Great Britain.28. Of the various petroleum products used in this country, fuel oil is the cheapest and most readily obtainable.29. Particulars of the oil imports into this country, classified according to products, for a series of years are given in Appendix I, Table 2.30. Improvements are continually being effected in the methods of treating and refining petroleum. This is particularly the case with motor spirit, due to the development of motor-car engines with high compression ratios, which has led to a demand for motor fuels writh good anti-detonating properties or good &quot;octane&quot; fuels, the anti-knock properties being measured by an &quot;Octane number.&quot;*81. It is possible to improve the anti-knock qualities of a given spirit by the addition of considerable proportions of such fuels as benzole or alcohol, or of small quantities of such &quot; anti-knocks &quot; as tetraethyl lead. The latter when mixed in small quantities with the spirit has a marked effect. For various reasons of a technical nature, the improvement effected by this &quot; anti-knock &quot; cannot be extended indefinitely, and only a small proportion of tetraethyl lead can be used effectively.32. The development of the diesel or compression-ignition engine for motor transport has also led to the demand for a high quality light diesel oil for&apos; use in such engines. In these engines fuels with good &quot;cetene numbers &quot;* are required, with the opposite combustion characteristics to motor spirit.33. The Committee wish to draw attention to these many points, because they are of moment when the possibilities of making substantial quantities of oil products from coal and other materials indigenous to this country come under consideration.34. There is one other modern development of importance which should be mentioned, viz., the provision of special fuels suitable for aviation purposes.35. The Committee have already made a reference to the increasing consumption of oil in all important countries. In the case of Great Britain there has been an increase in imports between 1920 and 1986 of over 280 per cent. Between 1920 and 1925 the increase was 83 per cent.; between 1925 and 1980, 49 per cent.; and between 1980 and 1986, 22 per cent. Details of the total imports for certain years from 1920 to 1986 and of the percentage of the requirements supplied by particular countries are given in Appendix I, Table 8.* The octane number of a petrol is defined as the percentage of iso-octane by volume in a blend with normal heptane, the blend having the same knocking tendency as the petrol under specified conditions of test in a standard single cylinder engine. Thus, if the petrol is matched by a blend of 70 per cent, iso-octane and 30 per cent, heptane, its octane number is 70. so-oetane and normal heptane are pure hydrocarbons and possess constant properties, iso-octane having a high and heptane a low resistance to knocking. By definition, the octane number of iso-octane is 100 and that of heptane is 0.In the ease of diesel fuels ignition quality is expressed in terms of the percentage of cetene in a blend with alpha-methyl uaphthaleno having the same ignition delay angle as the test fuel in a compression-ignition engino under specified test conditions.
86. As regards the c.i.f. value per gallon of oil imports into this country, the changes in recent years have been within quite small limits. Oil is included in that comparatively small list of commodities the prices of which are at present lower than the pre-war level. Particulars of the c.i.f. values for a series of years are given in Appendix I, Table 4.37. The Committee have addressed themselves to the question whether there is any likelihood of the demand outstripping the supply in the near future, to such an extent as to bring about a substantial rise in prices. This question has a very important bearing on the production of oil from sources indigenous to this country, as processes which at current prices may be quite uneconomic, might, if there were a substantial rise in world-prices, become paying propositions.38. The possibility of such a rise in world prices has been brought forward by certain witnesses when advocating various processes. The Committee have obtained opinions from a number of responsible quarters, and the general view seems to be that there is little likelihood of a substantial advance in the near future.39. A leading British oil industrialist told the Committee that there has never been a time in the history of the industry when it was possible to produce so greatly in excess of immediate demands.40. It would appear to the Committee useless for any industry, which is developed for the production of oil from coal, to build on the hope that the substantial gap which may exist between the cost of petroleum oil products, and those of home-produced oils, will be bridged by a rise in world prices within a few years&apos; time.41. Nevertheless, the situation may change, and if this should happen within a period of even ten or fifteen years from now, it must be recognised that a considerable number of years would be required in which to establish a new industry on the scale necessary to meet the needs of this country.Section II.PRODUCTION OF OIL FROM HOME SOURCES.42. There are six or seven possible methods of producing oil products in this country, and the Committee think it . will be convenient if these are classified in three categories : A. Natural petroleum and shale oil.B. The coal carbonisation industries : (i) gas industry,(ii) coke oven industry,(iii) low temperature carbonisation. C. Hydrogenation; Fischer and similar synthetic processes.48. The Committee have placed the shale oil industry in Category A because it is practicable to produce from crude Scottish shale oil a full range of products similar to those obtained from natural petroleum. It was, in fact, the early work carried out on shale oil in this country which greatly assisted the early commercial development of the petroleum industry.A. (i) Natural Petroleum.44. It has been for some years the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage the search lor natural petroleum in this country, but so far the quantities discovered have been negligible.45. The search was started during the latter part of the Great War, when the work, was carried out by Messrs. S. Pearson and Sons, Ltd., acting on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and about  560,000 was spent on the effort. Eleven boreholes were put down, mainly in the Midlands, but, except for one small producer in Derbyshire, from which a small output of good quality petroleum is still obtained, the work failed to show the existence of supplies of oil of any consequence.
46. A few years ago renewed interest was shown, and it was represented to the Government that one of the big obstacles to serious work was the unsuitability of existing legislation. Accordingly, a new Petroleum (Production) Bill was introduced to Parliament in the Spring of 1934. This Bill became law in July, 1984, and Regulations made under it were issued in 1985. Under the Act the property in any oil which may exist in this country is vested in the Grown.47. Several deep boreholes have already been drilled, one having reached over 6,500 feet and another 5,100 feet. Four boreholes have been abandoned as unsuccessful, but others are being drilled.48. As the efforts made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the period 1918-22 indicate, the work of searching and drilling for oil is a costly one, but with companies of the standing of those now interested in the search, there has been no difficulty in private enterprise finding the necessary capital. All the licences contain a schedule of working obligations, and the work is being carried on as expeditiously as circumstances will permit.49. The Committee have taken note of the renewed activity which is being displayed in this direction, and, while it is possible that increased supplies may be found, they do not consider the position is as yet sufficiently clear to warrant them taking such a possibility into account as a factor affecting their conclusions.A.-(ii) Shale Oil.50. The Scottish shale oil industry was started in about 1850, and was for many years the sole indigenous source of oils similar to petroleum products.51. It is extremely difficult to make a reliable estimate of the quantity of shale available, owing to the variations in quality and thickness of seams from place to place. Economic factors also control the quantity it is practicable to work at any given time. An estimate published in 1918 by H.M. Geological Survey and based on economic conditions existing during the ten years preceding 1914, arrived at a probable reserve of 482 million tons in the counties of Mid Lothian, West Lothian, Lanark and Peebles. Since this estimate was made, however, exploration has proved certain areas to be barren, while the change in economic conditions has completely altered the economic basis of the figures. Thus there is a very much smaller reserve, than was thought to exist, although enough amply to justify development under suitable economic conditions.52. The methods employed in mining shale differ only in detail from those for coal. After the shale has been brought to the surface, it is passed between rollers, in order to reduce it to a size most suitable for retorting. The shale is fed continuously into the retort by a hopper at the top, and passes down vertical tubes by gravity through zones of rising temperature, and is finally discharged mechanically at the bottom, having then parted with its valuable constituents. ,53. Several designs of retort have been employed from time to time, as it is the method of retorting which determines to a large extent the yield and quality of the products.54. In the retorting process, the organic matter contained in the shale is converted into new forms which pass off as vapour, the greater part of which is condensed into crude oil and ammonia water by atmospheric cooling: the lighter portion is recovered by &apos;&apos; scrubbing &apos;&apos; with a spray of oil (yielding scrubber naphtha); a further quantity of ammonia is abstracted by &apos;&apos; scrubbing &apos;&apos; with water, and the permanent gas which has passed these treatments is used as fuel.55. About 20 pev cent, by weight of the shale is converted into oil products, &amp;c, the remaining 80 per cent, of exhausted or spent shale (which is approximately of the same bulk as the original shale) being discharged from the bottom of the retort. Until recently, no economic use had been found for the spent shale, and great quantities have accumulated. But during the last few years a process has been developed for converting it into building bricks, which is proving successful.
io56. After a steady expansion over a number of years, the industry reached its maximum output of million tons of shale in 1918. It might have been assumed that this industry would have considerably expanded its operations during the war, but, on the contrary, owing to the withdrawal of men for the Forces, and consequent shortage of labour, the output of shale fell nearly 10 per cent, by 1915. Special efforts made to improve matters led to some increase being effected in 1916 and 1917, but in 1918 the output again fell slightly.57. During the post-war period low prices for the whole range of products caused successive reductions in the scale of operations and the industry was finally brought to a very critical condition. The situation was improved to some extent in 1928, when under the Finance Act of that year a Customs duty of 4d. a gallon was levied on imported motor spirit, with exemption for spirit produced at home from indigenous materials.58. Encouraged by the provisions of the 1928 Act, the shale oil industry at once adopted measures to increase the production of motor spirit by cracking some of its heavier products, thereby obtaining a larger yield of spirit. The duty was increased to 6d. per gallon in April, 1931, and to 8d. a few months later, the preference on home-produced spirit being correspondingly increased. These inducements were not sufficient, however, to prevent further restric-tion of shale output, which fell from its 1928 level of 2,038,000 tons to 1,733.000 tons in 1981 and to 1.400,000 tons (its present level) in 1932.59. Unfortunately, the industry was again soon in trouble as the steady improvement in the design of the petrol engine resulted in the demand for a spirit of higher anti-knock value than the industry could produce without increased blending.60. Further relief came, however, in 1985, when the duty on imported oils for use in diesel-engined road vehicles was raised from Id. to 8d. per gallon, exemption being again granted for home-produced oil.61. This enabled the industry to turn its attention to the produc-tion of light diesel oil, for which it is particularly suited, and in 1986, 41 per cent, of the crude oil production of the industry represented oil of this character.62. In 1936, 1,407,000 tons of shale were produced, and the average yield per ton was about 22 gallons of crude oil. In addition, 38 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia per ton were obtained. The total yield of liquid products amounted to 78,900 tons, or about 21 million gallons.   The quantities of the several products were : 	Tons.Motor Spirit and Naphtha	23,900Light Shale Oil.........	2,550Diesel Oil (for road vehicles) ...	48,000Gas Oil............	1,950Fuel Oil............	2,500	78,900In addition, 8,000 tons of paraffin wax and 2,400 tons of coke were produced.68. The Committee were assured that the most modern methods of operation are being used, and they are satisfied that the industry is being efficiently run. The Committee were given the opportunity of examining the detailed statements of account of the operating companies and of Scottish Oils, Ltd., and they are satisfied that, even with the present substantial assistance which is afforded by the preference on home-produced oils, the profit which is being earned is a very moderate one in relation to the value of the capital employed in the enterprise. The- value of this preference last year to the Shale Companies was no less than . 660,000, a figure in excess of the Companies&apos; total wages bill. The effect of the withdrawal of the preference would be to turn a modest rate of profit on capital into a heavy loss.64. At the peak period the industry found employment for some 10,000 men.   To-day, including those employed at a colliery which
supplies coal to the industry, and at two small ancillary works, occupation is found for 4,268 men and boys, who, in order that as many as possible may be given employment, work on a spread-over system of three weeks on and one week off.60. The present average rate of wages is 10s. 6d. per day. There have been four advances between November, 1982 and May, 1937.66. The case of this industry is an interesting one. It has existed for a long period of years and at times has enjoyed consider-able prosperity. But in spite of the improvements in organisation, concentration on the most efficient units, and the large measure of assistance at present afforded by the preference referred to above, amounting to more than the whole of the wages cost, it finds the competition of natural oil products difficult to withstand.67. Those responsible for the industry have stated that, if the preference is maintained, it will probably in time again be able to increase considerably its production. If, on the other hand, the preference were withdrawn, or materially reduced, it appears that the industry would once more be in a very parlous condition.68. The Committee consider that the industry is worthy of every encouragement. Its raw material cannot be put to any other use and there is no competition between its products and those of other existing home industries. Its production of diesel oil would be of assistance in meeting the demand for fuel for heavy road transport, which is bound to be of great importance in time of emergency. In addition, although the motor spirit produced is not of high octane value, and hence cannot be used for aviation purposes, it is suitable for motor transport. * .69. There are other considerable resources of shale in various parts of the country, but the possibility of the extension of the industry to utilise these is dependent upon the development of a process for the economical removal of sulphur, which is often associated with these shales.B. and C. : Processes for obtaining Oil from Coal.70. The other possible sources of home-produced oil are those which arise from the treatment of coal, which is the most important raw material indigenous to this country.71. Coal, as is well known, is chemically a very complicated substance. Its chief constituent is carbon, but other elements are combined with the carbon, notably hydrogen and oxygen.72. Oil, on the other hand, is essentially a mixture of hydro-carbons, the result of chemical combination of carbon and hydrogen.73. The underlying principle of all processes for producing liquid hydrocarbons from coal is that of increasing the ratio of hydrogen to carbon. Bituminous coal contains 4-5 to 5-5 per cent, by weight of hydrogen, and petroleum contains about 13 per cent., while the carbon content ruay be about the same in both cases. An increase in the ratio can be brought about by making coal react directly with hydrogen, or by carbonising it and so splitting it into volatile fractions (gas, spirit and tar), which contain a greater percentage of hydrogen than the original coal, and a residue (coke), which contains less. Thus high temperature coke contains about 0-4 per cent, of hydrogen by weight, and high temperature tar 6-5 per cent.; low temperature coke 8 per cent, and low temperature tar 8 per cent.74. The amount of hydrogen present in the coal, therefore, sets a theoretical maximum to the yield of oil that can be obtained by carbonisation. For several reasons, however, this maximum can never be reached. Some of the hydrogen is given off as gas, some combines with the oxygen present to form water, and some is left in the coke. Hence the amount of oil that can be produced, even under the best conditions, is necessarily small, and this applies to all carbonisation processes.75. On the other hand, the hydrogenation and synthetic processes both supply, although by different means, additional hydrogen, and so convert a great proportion of the coal into oil. This results in a substantially greater yield of oil products.
B. The Carbonisation Industries.(i) and (ii) Gas and Coke Oven Industries.76. It is convenient to deal with these two industries together, partly because, from the point of view of the Committee&apos;s investiga-tions, the same kind of considerations arise in both cases, and partly because it is not possible to separate for each industry the statistical information in regard to the production of oil products.77. Both industries carbonise the coal they use at high tempera-tures: both obtain gas, coke and tar as products. But the gaB industry being primarily concerned with the supply of gas for pur-poses of light, heat and power, aims at the largest practicable yield of gas; while the coke oven industry, primarily concerned with the supply of metallurgical coke to the iron and steel industry, endeavours to secure as large a yield of (k)ke as is feasible, although the sale of surplus gas to the gas industry is becoming of some importance.78. In the case of the gas industry, the coke and tar therefore are by-products, and in the case of the coke oven industry, the gas and tar fall into that category.79. From the foregoing it follows that the capacity of the gas and the coke oven industries to provide supplies of oil products io governed by the demand for their principal products.80. The gas in both industries is &quot; scrubbed &quot; for the recovery of benzole, further small quantities of which are also obtained from the tar: and the tar, on distillation, also produces a substantial quantity of creosote, with other products, such as phenol and naphthalene, and a large residuum of pitch.81.   It is the benzole and the creosote which mainly concern the Committee&apos;s investigations.82. Benzole, when refined, is of considerable importance for use as a motor fuel, being usually sold mixed with petrol. It possesses good anti-knock properties.83. But crude benzole also provides an important source of toluol, which in times of emergency is required in large quantities for the manufacture of high explosives.84. Phenol is also used to some extent in the making of explo-sives, but is now of more importance as a raw material in the plastics industry, and for the preparation of dyes and drugs.85. Creosote finds uses in a number of industries. During the past three years substantial quantities of it have been treated at Billingham by the hydrogenation process for the production of motor spirit.86. Benzole. On the basis of the tonnage of coal carbonised, 9S per cent, of the coke ovens scrub their gas for benzole, and the average yield of crude benzole during recent years has been just over 3 gallons per ton of coal carbonised. The yield depends mainly on the kind of coal, and particular method of carbonisation used; it may vary from 2 to 2^ gallons in some districts to as much as 4 to 5 gallons in others where high volatile coals are available. On the present basis it is doubtful if a much larger production of benzole can be expected from the coke oven industry, although, as modern installations replace old, and technique develops, some improvement will take place.87. In the case of the gas industry, there has been during the past few years a steady increase in the production of benzole. In 1986, however, on the basis of the tonnage of coal carbonised, only 47 per cent, of the gas works recovered benzole, while the average yield was 2  gallons of crude benzole per ton of coal carbonised, as compared with just over 8 gallons at coke ovens. In practice, therefore, the maximum yield of oil products is not made available in normal times.88. The difference in yields at coke ovens and gas works is to be accounted for mainly by the fact that benzole has a good heat value, and as gas works have a statutory obligation to supply their gas on a thermal basis, it is necessary to replace the heat value of benzole if this is extracted.   Large gas companies do this generally
by making a water gas from coke which is enriched by oil the so-called carburetted water-gas process. In the case of smaller under-takings, the expense of putting in benzole recovery plant and carburetted water-gas plant is a more serious matter, and the recovery of benzole is not regarded as an economic proposition. These considerations do not apply in the case of coke ovens, except those which supply gas to gas undertakings.89. One of the developments of the future as regards the gas industry may be the greater use of processes for the total gasification of coal. In that case the yield of tar per ton of coal gasified might be decreased, but it could not for many years have its influence on the total quantity of tar available.90. The following statement gives particulars of the production of crude benzole during the past three years and the output of refined products therefrom. These particulars were obtained from official statistics collected under the provisions of the British Hvdrocarbon Oils Production Act, 1984 :-193$. 1035. 19SG.Million tons.Total quantity of coal carbonised at gas works and coke ovens ...Crude benzole produced By gas stripping at gas works   .

While production in 1936, of 51 million gallons of motor fuel was a helpful contribution to the needs of this country, it represented only 4 per cent, of the total requirements. As the information given above indicates, there is a further potential supply available which, if it were possible for all gas works to scrub their gas for benzole, and to be brought up to the present standard of recovery obtaining at coke ovens, would represent a further quantity of about 85 million gallons of crude benzole, producing 20 million gallons of motor benzole, in addition to smaller quantities of other refined products. On the basis of the present scale of activity of the two industries, this would represent the practical limit of production.92. Creosote. The production of creosote by the distillation of tar amounted in 1986 to about 90 million gallons (410,000 tons).98. The proportion of creosote in tar represents generally about 40 per cent., so that it should have been possible, if all tar were distilled, to produce about 3J gallons per ton of coal carbonised, or a total of 146 million gallons per annum (660,000 tons). At present a large proportion of the tar is not distilled for the production of creosote, but after dehydration and distillation for recovery of the lighter products including benzole, is used for surfacing roads.94.

95. Economic Aspect. It has not been possible to obtain all the information which would be needed to enable the Committee to estimate the precise contribution which these different by-products make in the economics of the gas and coke oven industries. In the case of gas works, reference has been made to the heat value of the benzole. The Committee were informed that, while large gas works might be able to make the necessary arrangements to recover benzole at a cost of 4cl. a gallon, which is the amount of the guaranteed preference under the British Hydrocarbon Oils Production Act, smaller undertakings could not make it pay at 8d. a gallon, which is the amount of the actual preference.at present enjoyed. There is no doubt, however, that the existence of the preference, and especially the guarantee of a preference over a period of years, has led to an increase in the recovery of benzole in both industries.96. The market prices of tar, creosote and pitch have fluctuated widely in recent years. A few years ago creosote was difficult to dispose of at more than a nominal figure, while at present the price of pitch is about 38s. per ton at works, compared with nearly ; 5 per ton four or five years ago. The guaranteed preference on home-produced motor spirit has, however, opened up a new and substantial market for creosote for treatment by hydrogenation and this has led to a great improvement in its market value for all purposes.97. The assistance thus given by the preferences on home-produced oils has, therefore, been of material help to these two-important industries and has resulted in an increase in the production of oil fuels.(iii) Low Temperature Carbonisation.98. In many ways the low temperature carbonisation industry is closely allied to the gas and coke oven industries, although the coal, as the name of the process suggests, is carbonised at considerably lower temperatures, generally within the range 550&quot;C. to 700oC.99. The main product of the low temperature carbonisation process is a semi-coke which is suitable for burning in domestic grates, and its other yields are by-products.100.   The methods used fall roughly into two main divisions : (a) Those which carbonise coal alone.(6) Those which carbonise a mixture of coal and oil.The majority of plants in operation belong to Class (a).101. With regard to Class (b) the yield of oil per ton of mixture processed is, as might be expected, greater than if coal alone were used. When, however, the quantity of oil used in the mixture is taken into account, the recovery of tar oil from the coal alone shows very little, if any, improvement. Although some technical advantages may be claimed, in practice no great improvement is associated with this method. In the view of the Committee, there is, therefore, little-advantage to be derived from the use of this method as opposed to the carbonisation of coal alone. In addition, the fact that oil is required in the original mixture wyould make this method one of very doubtful value in time of war if petroleum oil were used. Claims have been made, however, that coal oils could be used, but the Committee are satisfied that supplies in sufficient quantity are not available for these purposes to enable large-scale development to take place.102. The low temperature carbonisation process for treating coal has obtained much publicity in recent years. Numerous companies have been floated to exploit various inventions. Unfortunately, the great majority of these ventures have been based on claims that were subsequently proved to be too sanguine. Difficulties which were not apparent when the coal was treated only on a laboratory scale have appeared when full-sized plants were worked, and as allowances for meeting these difficulties had not been made in estimating results, much money has been lost.
103. For some years an average of about  90,000 per annum has been provided by the Government for the work of the Fuel Research Coal Survey and the Fuel Research Station, and a part of this has been devoted to research in connection with the development of processes for the production of oil from coal.-Official Tests of Low Temperature Carbonisation Plants.104. The Committee desire to call attention to the fact that, in -order to assist in obtaining the fullest possible data in connection with these processes, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research is authorised to report free of charge on the technical aspects of any low temperature carbonisation process, provided it has reached a semi-commercial scale of development. A number of processes have already been examined in this way.105. Some complaints have been made that these tests are limited to an examination of the technical aspects of the carbonisation process only, and that it would be well if they were extended to give more attention to all technical claims made, and even to cover the economic aspects.106. The Committee feel that these reports could be made of still greater value if they dealt with all technical points connected with the operation of, and the products of the process, and not merely witli the carbonisation side, but they do not consider that it is desirable that they should extend beyond purely technical matters. The economic aspects involve many other considerations which are outside the purview of a technical investigation.Different methods of operating the process.107. As one might expect in the case of a new development of this kind there is on record a very large number of different methods -of operating the low temperature carbonisation process a figure of 150 has been given to the Committee by the Mines Department. Many of these have not advanced beyond the laboratory stage and a number, on being tried out in semi-commercial or even commercial scale plants, have failed.Extent of development.108. In 1936, official records show that there were 15 plants operating &quot; on a commercial or semi-commercial scale for the produc-tion and sale of products&apos;&apos;; these represented eleven different processes.   Several new plants are under construction.109. The following table gives the quantities of coal treated at low temperature carbonisation plants, and the total and average yield of products, for the years 1983-86 :  	Unit.	1933.	1934.	1935.	1936.

Products of Low Temperature Carbonisation.110. Coke. Low temperature coke provides a good fuel with valuable smokeless and radiating properties particularly suitable for domestic purposes, and on this account many people advocate a wide extension of the use of fuel of this class, in order to improve the atmospheric conditions of the large towns.111. Certain low temperature cokes are suitable for use in gas-producers for motor vehicle propulsion.112. Motor Spirit. -The quantity of refined motor spirit produced by low temperature carbonisation is about 2 to 3 gallons per ton of coal.   (A further H gallons can be obtained from the tar.)113. Tar. The yield of tar may be as high as 18 to 20 gallons per ton of coal treated. From this tar, as has been mentioned above, 1^ gallons of motor spirit can be obtained by distillation. The remainder of the tar may be utilised in three ways : (1) It may be consumed as a heavy boiler fuel.(2) It may be distilled until pitch is yielded. By this method 10-J- gallons of light fuel oil, and 80 lbs. of pitch, are obtained. The light fuel oil so produced is not by itself suitable for diesel oil, but can be made so by adding pro-knock compounds.Light tar produced by low temperature carbonisation contains a higher proportion of tar acids than tar produced by high temperature processes, and there is a gradually widening market for this class of product.(3) It may be treated by hydrogenation, and will then produce from 14 to 15 gallons of motor spirit.114. Gas. The quantity and quality of the gas produced by low temperature carbonisation vary greatly according to the method used. With certain types of the process, very large quantities of gas of a low calorific value are produced which are difficult to dispose of. The Committee were informed that in most cases the gas is not sold, but is used in the process to heat the retorts. In the case of those processes producing a high calorific value gas, it was stated that, if the gas companies were to purchase it, it would save them buying oil for enrichment purposes, as it would be possible, by using the low temperature gas, to make up any deficiency in the calorific value of their own gas at present secured by the addition of carburetted water gas.115. Low temperature gas of a high calorific value could also be used, when compressed, in motor vehicles, and it is claimed that a larger mileage per unit volume of gas could be obtained than with town&apos;s gas. A further claim made for low temperature gas is that it can be liquefied to the extent of over one-third of its quantity and sold in containers for domestic and industrial uses.Yields of oil products.116. As already pointed out the oil produced is a by-product; and while there is some variation in the yields of liquid products obtained from different processes, the evidence received has led the Committee to the conclusion that the extent of the variations does not represent more than a few gallons per ton. Accordingly, there is no single process which the Committee could advise should have special consideration on account of the quantity of oil products obtained.117. The Committee took evidence from the Low Temperature Coal Distillers&apos; Association, the President of which is also Chairman of the Low Temperature Carbonisation Co., Ltd. He explained in his evidence that he did not consider the production of oil to be the primary object of low temperature carbonisation; but he suggested that a large-scale development of the industry would result in a substantial contribution being made to the country&apos;s oil requirements.118. The yield of tar in most of the low temperature carbonisation -tion methods which have been tried out on a semi-commercial or commercial scale is about three-quarters as much again per ton of coal carbonised as that produced at gas works and coke ovens; and it is agreed that it is rather more amenable for the production of oil
fuels than high temperature- tar. The evidence received indicates, however, that the creosote fraction of high temperature tar, which amounts to about 40 per cent, of that tar, is equally, if not more, suitable than low temperature tar for the hydrogenation process.Possibilities of large-scale development.119. The question then arises: What are the prospects of a really large-scale development of low temperature carbonisation?  and to this point the Committee have given careful consideration.120. From the figures quoted in the Table in paragraph 109 it will be seen that the low temperature carbonisation method is first and foremost a coke-producing process, and that in consequence its commercial value is dependent on the possibility of disposing of the coke. This was accepted by the representatives of the Low Temperature Coal Distillers&apos; Association.121. The coke at present produced finds a ready sale, in spite of the fact that the price obtainable per ton is much in excess of that of gas coke, and higher than that of best house coal; while this is an encouraging feature, the evidence laid before the Committee led them to the conclusion that there is at present no assurance that there will be a really large market for such a highly priced fuel. The position might be altered, however, were legislation to be passed within a reasonable period which compelled the use of smokeless fuels for domestic fires, although a measure of this kind might also stimulate the consumption of alternative fuels, and there are indications that low temperature coke is likely to meet in future with increasing corn-petition. Developments are already taking place in regard to the use of high temperature coke in open grates, and steps are also being taken to promote the further use of smokeless coals, and for developing grates which will be able to use bituminous coals with little emission of smoke.122. If these several attempts are successful, then the Committee think that, while low temperature coke may take its place with these other fuels, any idea that it can capture the whole or even a large part of the domestic market is open to question.123. The Committee further examined the claim made by many advocates of low temperature coke that a big development of this process would bring about a much wished for revival in the coal industry.124. The Committee have to report, however, in this connection, that the conclusions they arrived at were disappointing. In so far as low temperature coke might be used as a substitute for raw coal, very little increased demand for coal would ensue, as it is calculated that only 10 per cent, more coal would be required to give an equivalent amount of fuel and heat value.125. Representatives of the coal industry itself were very doubtful if any advantage would be gained by that industry if a large increase in the manufacture of coke by low temperature carbonisation were to take place. These representatives drew the attention of the Committee to the following considerations. The coal which is required for low temperature carbonisation is a cheap grade of small coal, and this, after conversion into coke, would be sold to -those householders who had previously bought household coal. At the present time, the household coal side of the coal industry is the most remunerative, and the net result would be the diminution of this trade, and of the total receipts of the industry, as the sales of low temperature coke increased.126. The Committee made a calculation of the results that would ensue if it were possible to secure a large scale development to the extent of treating, say, 10 million tons of coal by low temperature carbonisation. The coke produced would amount to 7^ million tons against a production of 287,000 tons in 1936. As regards oil pro-duction about 80 million gallons of motor spirit representing about 2 per cent, of the present consumption might be produced from the gas; and 170 million gallons of heavy oil, of which 60 million gallons might be suitable for use as fuel oil by the Navy, would be obtained.
If hydrogenation plants were available (and for their erection a very large capital expenditure would be involved) the heavy oil could be converted into, say, 150- million gallons of motor spirit. Even these quantities of oil would represent a small fraction of the national requirements. In any event, the practical difficulties of securing anything approaching this development within any reasonable period are so great that they preclude any serious account being taken of such a possibility. Accordingly, in the view of the Committee, low temperature carbonisation must, in the light of existing information, be ignored as a possible major source of indigenous oil supply.] 27. To the extent that low temperature carbonisation can develop on normal lines it will, like the. other carbonisation industries, make a contribution to the problem of smoke abatement and efficient fuel utilisation, and at the same time will provide some addition to the country&apos;s supplies of home-produced oils.128. In the present state of development, and with such a variety of methods of operating the process, the Committee have found it impracticable to reach any general conclusion about the costs of operation of, or the revenue to be derived from, low temperature carbonisation. In view of the fact that coke is the main product the economics of the process must largely depend on the price which requires to be paid for the coal used and the price which can be obtained for the coke produced. In regard to the first of these factors, it appears that the cost of coal for processing has increased recently, and in regard to the second, the Committee have already mentioned that there are indications that low temperature coke may meet in future with increasing competition, which would have its effect on the price obtainable for the coke.129. As regards the by-products which include oil, the position is similar to that of the other carbonisation industries and sufficient data is not available to enable the Committee to assess the part played by these by-products in the economics of the industry. The Committee were informed that the benefit obtained by low tempera-ture carbonisation from the preference on home-produced oils does not contribute a very large addition to the total revenue obtained from all the products, but they consider that it has been of definite assistance to the industry.&apos;   C. Hydrogenation, Fischer and similar Synthetic Processes.(i) Hydrogenation.130. The hydrogenation process differs fundamentally from the processes in Category 13, just described, in that the sole object of this method when treating coal is the production of oil. No important products are obtained which compete with coal, or with its by-products such as gas and coke, and the successful economic development of the process on a large scale would open up an entirely new field for the use of coal. This is a most important factor in the consideration of the relative merits of the various processes. A mixture of coal and tar, or tar only, can also be converted to oil by this process.131. Much information has been supplied to the Committee concerning the work on this process which has been carried out at Billingham during the past ten years by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd. This, together with some particulars of the earlier history of the process, may be summarised as follows : 132. The history of hydrogenation so far as this country is concerned goes back to 1921, when Sir George Beilby had some discussions with Dr. Bergius, the German inventor of the process. As a result, in 1928, experiments were commenced at the Fuel Research Station, and a year later several important firms formed the British Bergius Syndicate for the purpose of investigating the process in relation to British coals.188. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., joined the Syndicate in 1925,&apos; and by 1927, this Company had acquired the entire assets of the Syndicate, which it was stated consisted in options to obtain licences under the Bergins patents subject to payments to the Inter-national Bergius Syndicate.
134. About this time the German I.G. Company, who were most actively occupied in the coal hydrogenation field, concluded an agree-ment with the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, and were later joined by the Royal-Dutch-Shell Group, who were also interested in hydrogenation, mainly in regard to the treatment of oils and tars. In 1980, the three groups formed International Hydrogenation Patents, Ltd., which provided for the pooling of all patents and technical information.135. Meanwhile, Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., were independently developing a process of their own for the treatment of coal. They found, however, that the group formed by the above companies held several hundred patents, and to facilitate their own activities and avoid continuous patent litigation, they considered it desirable to participate with the other groups.186. In 1931, the Company concluded an agreement with the new combine which brought them into the pool and gave them important rights for the British Empire.137. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., state that this arrange-ment is working satisfactorily, and in practice there are no restrictive clauses in their agreement which would prevent the large scale development of hydrogenation if this were considered desirable and practicable.138. Experimental work started at Billingham early in 1927, and in 1929 it was decided to build a pilot plant there to treat 10 tons of coal per day. The plant was started up later in the same year and ran until the end of 1981.139. In 1930, Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., gave Govern-ment experts an opportunity of making a full investigation of the work which was being done and of examining available data in regard to costs. For some time subsequently discussions took place with the Government as to the possibility of securing development of the process on a larger scale.140. In July, 1988, the Government announced their intention of introducing legislation to give a guaranteed preference on home-produced motor spirit over a period of years, and on this undertaking being given Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., decided to proceed at once with the erection of a large scale commercial plant. This plant, which was built with capital entirely provided by the Company, com-nienced operation, for the treatment of creosote, in February, 1985. Coal was injected in June of that year.141. The essential feature of the hydrogenation process, whether applied to coal, to tar oils, or to petroleum oils, is that hydrogen supplied from an external source is made to combine with the carbon in the coal or coal tar by means of a catalytic process with the object of converting these substances into oil, or, in the case of petroleum, of improving the yields and qualities of particular oil products.142. In the plant at Billingham there are two main sections, the liquid phase system and the vapour phase system. The former, which is carried out in two stages, is used for the purpose of liquefying coal and treating oils of high boiling point, and the latter for liquid products of lower boiling points. With petroleum oils or coal tar oils of suitable boiling point, the liquid phase system can be omitted, which is a matter of considerable importance.148. The coal to be processed is first subjected to a cleaning operation. The clean coal is then mixed in a grinding mill with ah equal weight of coal oil, to form a paste. To the paste is added a small quantity of catalyst. The catalysts used vary, both with the raw material and the product it is desired to make.144. The paste is then injected against a working pressure of about 275 atmospheres (pressures up to 850 atmospheres are contemplated by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., in any new plant, and in Germany it is understood that even higher pressures are being adopted), and is passed to the hydrogenation plant, where it is mixed with hydrogen in converters at the required temperature. Liquefaction of the coal takes place at about 450oC.
145. The coal, with the exception of a small quantity of coke and oily residue, which is used as a fuel, is transformed into oils, which consist of heavy oil, middle oil and petrol. The heavy oil is re-cycled. The middle oil is subjected to treatment in the vapour phase plant, in which the oil is vaporised, mixed with hydrogen as before in the presence of a fixed catalyst. The vapour phase product is then distilled to separate the petrol from the residual middle oil, which is treated again. The petrol as it leaves the plant is a finished, high-grade product ready for use.146. It will thus be seen that the work at Billingham has covered each stage of development. First, considerable investigation was undertaken in the laboratory. Then extensive wrork followed in a semi-commercial scale unit, and, finally, for the past two and a half years, there has been the experience .of a large commercial scale plant.147.. This programme could only have been carried through by an undertaking having great resources, both financial and technical. It is a high testimony to the skill of all concerned that the plant is now virtually in full operation. In 1936, the production was about 120,000 tons of petrol, and the estimated production for 1937 is 130,000 tons, against a designed capacity of 150,000 tons.148. However, in spite of the most thorough investigation at each of the earlier stages in the development, difficulties which were not anticipated have been experienced in the large scale plant, which have involved the Company in some expense and delay. With any process as novel as this, it is not surprising that this should be so and the experience of Billingham suggests very forcibly the necessity of accepting with caution any schemes of this kind involving very large capital expenditure, even if there is available, as in this case, great experience and data based on the most complete preparatory work.149. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., stated that none of these difficulties were of a fundamental character, and when the Committee visited Billingham they were informed that the conditions on the plant were quite satisfactory mechanically and promising a steady technical improvement.150. It may be mentioned that, apart from the difficulties arising from the working of the plant, twice since the plant started the quality of the petrol has had to be improved to meet the demands of the market for, petrols with higher octane numbers. This has inevitably resulted in some reduction of the plant yields.The operations at BiUingham.Capacity of plant.151. The Billingham plant was originally intended to deal with coal only and to have a rated output capacity of 100,000 tons (80 million gallons) of motor spirit. It was subsequently decided to include provision for the treatment of coal tars to the extent of 50,000 tons of petrol per annum, thus making the capacity 150,000 tons (45 million gallons) of petrol.Coal and tar requirements.152.   The quantity of coal which was then expected would berequired for the plant when in lull operation is stated to be as follows : (a) Coal hydrogenation. Tons.*For processing        .........       ... 150-200,000For all other purposes (steam, power, hydrogen production, &amp;c.) 800-850,000500,000i(b) Tar oils hydrogenation.For steam, power, hydrogen production, &amp;c. 100,000Total ............ 600,000This gives for the coal hydrogenation 1 ton of petrol for each 1-J- to 2 tons processed, or for each 5 tons of total coal used.* The exact quantity depends, amongst other things, on the ash and moisture content of the coal.t In addition about 60,000 tons of tar oils are required.
Yields of Products.153. The difficulties with coal hydrogenation previously mentioned have resulted up to date in less coal being processed and more creosote, supplemented by some low temperature tar.154. In a new plant treating coal only, the total amount of coal required, including that for the production of hydrogen, power, &amp;c, as well as for processing, is estimated to be 4-1 tons per ton of petrol made.155. The spirit produced by the plant is of a high grade and during the last few months an octane rating of 75 has been achieved. This is a high standard for a straight or undoped petrol.156. The Committee made enquiries as to the possibilities of obtaining other oil products by the hydrogenation process. The views of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., were as follows -. &quot; Diesel Oil.Oils suitable for engines up to 1,000 r.p.m. have already been made without modification of the present process. Such oils are not, except when doped, as suitable for high speed diesel engines, such as are used in road vehicles, as diesel oils made from paraffinie crude oils, but are superior to the aromatic oils derived from carbonisation processes, or made by hvdrogenation with less effective catalysts than those available to companies forming International Hydrogenation Patents, Ltd.Approximately half the output of a hydrogenation plant could be made as diesel oil (the other half being petrol). The yield and cost of diesel oil would be similar to that of petrol.&quot;Fuel Oil.The heavy oil fraction of the crude products from coal is generally suitable as a fuel oil. Care is necessary to obtain the absence of asphaltic solids which have given some trouble in recent samples. About one-third of the output of a coal hydro-hydrogenation plant could be obtained as fuel oil, the remainder being petrol or petrol and diesel oil. Owing to the low hydrogen content of the fuel oil, the cost is substantially less than that of petrol, and our calculations have indicated that fuel oil would be profitable if a realisation of very approximately  7 to  8 per ton could be obtained.&quot; Lubricating Oil.Present indications are that lubricating oil cannot be made by the direct hydrogenation of bituminous coal or tars. Possible methods of manufacture are: polymerisation of unsaturated hydrocarbon gases made from the gaseous hydrocarbons which are by-products to the process, and the manufacture of synthetic oils from the light oils made by hydrogenation via chlorination and condensation, similar to the methods used in the Fischer process to build up lubricating oils from the crude product. Information on both these possibilities is too scanty to give even indications of yields or cost.&quot;157. At present, therefore, it appears to be clear that the hydrogenation process must be regarded as most suitable for the production of high grade spirit.Coals suitable for hydrogenation.158. The range of coals which are suitable for the process is another important factor in considering the question of hydrogena-tion. The Committee were informed by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., that the most suitable coals for hydrogenation are boiler slacks, not only because they are cheap, but because the friable coal included the most easily hydrogenable coal.159. It was, therefore, considered desirable in ordinary practice to operate the hydrogenation process in conjunction with collieries working under normal commercial conditions, so that the larger sizes of coal could be sold for household and similar uses, leaving the smaller sizes to be used for the process.
160. Tests had been carried out with a large variety of coals from the coal-fields of Durham, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Scotland and South Wales.161. It had been found that all coals of which the carbon content, on an ash and moisture-free basis, was less than 87 per cent., were amenable to hydrogenation. In order to obtain a coal for processing of as low an ash content as possible, special cleaning was essential, and this operation was stated to cost, in respect of the coal selected for processing, approximately Is. per ton of raw coal bought.162. A special large-scale test had been carried out on South Wales coals, at the request of the Mines Department, and the Committee were informed that favourable results had been obtained in respect of some of the coals submitted and Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., were satisfied that sufficient supplies were available to meet the requirements of a plant in that area. Anthracite and steam coals were not suitable.The -possibilities of a new coal hydrogenation plant.163. If a new hydrogenation plant were to be built, it would have to be designed to use coal only, as there are not available supplies of creosote or low temperature tar in sufficient quantities to provide for another mixed coal and tar plant. The plant would have a capacity of 150,000 tons of petrol as Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., regard this size as the minimum from an economic point of view.164. Capital Cost. The capital cost of such a plant (to include land, offices, site development and design charges, research charges essential for this new plant, working capital, interest during con-struction, and fees payable to the International Hydrogenation Patents, Ltd.) is estimated by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., at  8 million, made up approximately as follows : Cost of plant, materials, &amp;c. General services and workshops Boilers and power plant Gas-making,    purification    and compression , Hydrogenation   plant   and   re-finerySundry charges Research during construction ... Interest during construction   ... Working capital ... I.H.P. fee        .........This estimate takes into account the increased cost of materials since the Billingham hydrogenation plant was built, and incorporates all the latest technical improvements.165. Costs of Production. Although the Committee were given very complete details of the running costs of the - Billingham plant, Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., represented that in using such data in relation to future plants, it was necessary to have regard to the following factors: first, the Billingham plant is treating both coal and tar oils, and to separate clearly the costs attributable respectively to each, an arbitrary basis must largely be adopted; second, the Billingham plant has to run in conjunction with the ammonia factory and consequently hydrogen production practice is not the same as would be adopted in a new plant; third, about half the plant was originally built for the ammonia factory and was purchased and installed in 1927.1,035,000 1,570,0001,762,0002,880,0007,247,000&apos;750,0007,997,000 Say,  8,000,000.
(-j O  166. The Committee are satisfied that it is proper to have regard to these factors, and the estimated results which are set out below are based on the information given to the Committee by the Company concerning the costs of production in a new plant.167. In considering the costs, it is necessary to include a charge in respect of depreciation and obsolescence of works and plant. The term &quot; depreciation &quot; is intended to cover the physical wear and tear of the plant, &amp;c, which cannot be made good by maintenance expenditure or by expenditure on renewals of the component parts of the plant as and when they wear out. The charge for &quot; obsolescence &quot; is one that requires to be superimposed upon the charge for depreciation; obsolescence being the loss of value due to the fact that, before a plant is physically worn out, it may be uneconomic to work in view of varying circumstances, such as the fact that more up-to-date and efficient plant can be installed in its place. Other causes which in the present instance ma3r create obsolescence of the plant are improvements in the quality of the products demanded by the market and the fact that the commercial prospects of the hydrogenation process rest on the extent and duration of the preference on home-produced oil.168. Considerable discussion took place with the representatives of the Company on this, subject and the Company considered that, in view of all the circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to charge in respect of depreciation and obsolescence combined such an annual sum as would write off the whole of the capital expenditure within a period of 10 years as a maximum. The Committee felt it desirable, however, to have an alternative estimate made which ignored the probable factor of obsolescence and had regard to depreciation only. They therefore asked the Company to prepare such a calculation: and this showed an average life, taking the works and plant as a whole, of 20 years. The Company, in furnishing this data, however, made it quite clear that they could not accept such a calculation as giving an adequate charge.169. Result of Operations. The estimated results of operations on a new plant thus calculated are shown below. The figures are set out in two columns the first column dealing with a calculation for the depreciation of the plant on the basis of a 20-year life (i.e., with no provision for obsolescence), and the second column on the basis of charge for depreciation and obsolescence combined sufficient to write off the plant within 10 years.Pence per Gallon.Assumed average realisation price at works (assuming the existing rate of preference of 8(7. per gallon)      ...............     12-00 1200Deduct Works costs (including works overheads)     ...      7-20 7-20Works profit before providing for depreciation andobsolescence ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      4-80 4-80Deduct Provision for depreciation at 5 per cent.    ...      213 Provision for depreciation and obsolescenceat 10 per cent................        ... 4-27Profit after charging depreciation    ...      ...      ...      2-67*Profit after charging depreciation and obsolescence       ... 0-53** On the capital employed and the estimated production of spirit 2-67(7. would represent a return of about 6J per cent, and 0-53(7. about li per cent.170. It may be noted that in preparing this estimate coal has been charged at prices between 14s. and 17s. per ton depending on the qualities. An additional Is. per ton on all coal used involves an increase of 0-16d. per gallon to the cost of petrol.Further Develojmient of Hydrogenation.171. In view of the great interest which Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., have shown in the hydrogenation process, the Committee considered it desirable to ascertain the views of the Company concerning the possibilities of further developments. These views are summarised in the following paragraphs.
172. Under present conditions the Company would not be prepared to enter into any extension of their commitments in regard to further hydrogenation development, nor did they anticipate that any other commercial organisation would be prepared to do so.178. The British Hydrocarbon Oils Production Act, 1984, under which the preference on home-produced oils is guaranteed, will expire, at the present rate of preference, in October, 1989, and the period remaining would barely allow for the completion of any new plant, and, therefore, would be of no assistance during its operation.174. The Company stated that even if the guarantee of protection were unlimited, they would not extend their hydrogenation eommit-ments for at least another two years, when they would have derived full benefit from the Billingham experience. They felt that anything of so national a character as oil from coal, considered as a defence measure, required participation by wider interests, but that they would be prepared to consider contributing a certain amount. They would also be prepared to assist any venture with the necessary licensing, design, construction and management in return for a reasonable remuneration.175. If the Government desired that the further development of hydrogenation by commercial interests should be undertaken, it was the Company&apos;s view that the scope of the Government assistance necessary would have to cover (a) An additional guarantee period under the above Act for a sufficient length of time and at a rate to make any-additional proposition commercially economic.(6) A reasonable rate of return on such capital as is provided by commercial interests.(c) The provision of sufficient allowance for depreciation and obsolescence during the guarantee period.The form and extent of assistance should be equated over the extended guarantee period to provide for fluctuations in the price of the products, labour and raw materials.176. With regard to the above three conditions, the Company felt that these questions were so inter-related that it was difficult to estimate with any accuracy the period for which the assistance would be necessary, but if the preference remained at 8d. per gallon, the period should be at least 10 years.(ii) Synthetic Processes.177. The processes classed under this heading belong to the same categoiy as hydrogenation, inasmuch as the sole object of both is the conversion of coal into oil, without solid by-products other than waxes. In their technical aspects, however, the methods differ widely.178. There are two of these processes, one of which is being developed at present in Germany, viz. : the Fischer-Tropsch process (generally called the Fischer process), and the other,&quot;the process of Synthetic Oils, Ltd., is being investigated in this country in a semi-commercial unit.The Fischer Process.179. This process is founded on experiments carried out in Germany by Professor Franz Fischer and Dr. Tropsch over a number of years. Professor Fischer, reading a Paper before the Kaiser Wilhehn Institute for Fuel in December, 1930, which dealt with &apos;&apos; Benzine Synthesis from Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen at Ordinary Pressure,&quot; began by recalling that Professor Sabatier had in 1902 carried out certain experiments, and had hydrogenated carbon monoxide into methane by means of catalysts at ordinary pressure. He pointed out that, in 1925, in collaboration with Dr. Tropsch, he had discovered that by using special catalysts the sj&apos;nthesis of higher aliphatic hydrocarbons could be carried out instead of the synthesis of methane. These experiments were continued for a number of years in the laboratory.
180. Description of Process.-The process consists in the con-version of so-called &quot;synthesis gas&quot; a mixture of 1 volume of carbon monoxide and 2 volumes of hydrogen into an oil product. The starting material may be either coal or coke. If coke is used, it is treated in a water gas plant for the production of water gas, which is then converted to &quot; synthesis gas.&quot; If coal is used as the starting material, it is first coked in coke ovens in the normal way. The coke is employed for the production of water gas. The coke oven gas is decomposed to help to provide the &quot; synthesis gas.&quot; Semi-coke and low temperature carbonisation gases can be used in a similar manner.181. In order that the main catalytic process may be carried out efficiently, it is first necessary to remove sulphuretted hydrogen from the gas and then to treat it for the removal of organic sulphur compounds. For this purpose the gas is passed through towers, containing a catalyst, maintained at a temperature between 2000 and 800&quot; C. The gas is then taken at atmospheric pressure through the main reaction chambers containing the catalyst, for conversion to hydrocarbon products. The actual reaction temperature at which the synthesis is effected is between 180&quot; and 210&quot; C, and the tempera-ture must be controlled within narrow limits. The reaction chambers are so designed that the large amount of heat generated in the reaction is removed and utilised. On leaving the reaction chamber, the gas is cooled, the higher-boiling products are condensed, and the more volatile products are absorbed on active charcoal from which they are subsequently recovered.182. The product obtained from the synthesis of the gas is known as the primary product and consists of gaseous, liquid and solid hydrocarbons. This primary product has to be further treated to obtain the final commercial products. The liquid primary product which forms the bulk of the yield can be distilled to give motor spirit, diesel oil and soft and hard wax, or it can be cracked to produce mainly motor spirit.183. The process has recently found great favour in Germany, and large developments are taking place there. Plants are also reported to be in operation or under consideration in other countries, including Japan, France and South Africa.184. In November, 1934, the first experimental semi-commercial plant, with a capacity of 1,000 tons of mixed hydrocarbons per annum, commenced operations. The plant was erected at Oberhausen-Holten by the Ruhrchemie A.G., a concern which was founded by the Ruhr coal, steel and iron interests to operate a chemical industry in conjunction with the coal industry.185. In 1985, the Ruhrbenzin A.G., a subsidiary of Ruhrchemie, was formed, and it was proposed to erect an installation for the production of 25,000 tons of light motor fuel per annum, which could be increased to 75,000 tons in the event of success in the smaller plant.186. The first commercial scale plant was erected at Holten in 1936 by Ruhrbenzin A.G. This plant had a capacity of 80,000 tons of primary product per annum and commenced production in August, 1986.187. Work on synthesis of hydrocarbons from mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen has been carried out at the Fuel Research Station during the past three years. In addition to the study of the technique of the process for the production of the direct primary product, one of the chief objects has been to examine the nature of the lubricating oils which can be prepared by the polymerisation of the primary product. A pilot plant capable of treating 100 cubic feet of synthesis gas per hour is in continuous operation. Attention is being directed to the modification of the conditions and the nature of the reactions. Certain aspects of the process and, in particular, the purification of water gas from organic sulphur compounds, were investigated at the Fuel Research Station as long ago as 1926. Two processes for the manufacture of synthesis gas from British coal in a full-scale water gas plant have been evolved.
188. The Committee considered much data and took a consider-able amount of evidence relating to the technical methods and costs of this process, and to developments which are reported to be taking place abroad.189. As only small-scale laboratory experiments have so far been carried out in Great Britain, it follows that there is no practical experience available of the working of the process in this country. Accordingly, the data received is of a different character from that which has been made available to the Committee in regard to hydrogenation. Facilities for.a proper technical investigation of the process in Germany are only accorded to those willing to pay a substantial fee to Ruhrchemie, the German owners of the patent rights, as a preliminary to acquiring a licence, a step which no concern in this country has so far taken.190. Certain important industrial concerns in this country have given close consideration to the possibility of establishing a plant here. At one stage these concerns were brought together by His Majesty&apos;s Government and invited to consider whether they could submit, either individually or acting together, a reasonable business proposition to the Government which envisaged the establishment of a plant.191. These interests represented important groups concerned with the coal industry, the oil industry and the plant construction industry. If such a combination had been prepared to undertake the erection of a Fischer plant, it would have constituted an important step in the investigation of this process on a commercial scale in this country. It is understood that the attempt failed. This is a matter of importance, because it indicated that there was a divergence of views in regard either to (1) the value of the process to this country; (2) the stage of development which has been reached: or (8) the procedure to be followed for establishing the process here.192. Some of the witnesses who were prepared to suggest that the Fischer process should be developed on a commercial scale in this country, were obviously influenced in their views largely because of the scale of development which is taking place in Germany. Some went so far as to say that the Fischer process was being developed to the exclusion of the Bergius hydrogenation process. The general views expressed to the Committee go to show that both processes are being developed as part of the policy of the German Government to make Germany self-supporting in regard to supplies of motor fuels. But whereas in the case of hydrogenation there has been, both in Germany and in this country, experience of large commercial scale operations over a number of years, with the Fischer process, such experience is only very recent. As already pointed out, the first com-mercial scale plant did not begin operations until August, 1986. It follows, therefore, that the operation of commercial scale plants is still to a large extent in the development stage, and time must elapse before the most suitable methods of &quot; working up &quot; the crude product  an be established.198. It is also important to bear in mind that in Germany a :substantial proportion of the raw material used in these oil from coal processes is brown coal, of which very large supplies are readily obtainable, at a much cheaper rate than bituminous coal. In this country no commercial supplies of indigenous brown coal are available.194. In the following paragraphs the Committee summarise the more important points which have emerged from the evidence they have received.195. Preparation of Gas for the Synthesis. There are several methods of preparing the synthesis gas, but opinions varied as to which was the most suitable. The alternatives of gas from coke ovens supplemented by water gas made from coke, or the carbonising of -coal, and using the coke for making water gas, which is subsequently converted to synthesis gas, are the two methods most favoured. It was also suggested that water gas could be made by the direct .gasification of coal, and if this were practicable it would be a matter
of some importance in this country, as it would enable non-coking instead of coking coals to be used. But the witnesses who put forward the suggestion agreed that this method had not been definitely established on a commercial scale. They proposed, therefore, that the Government should consider assisting research on this problem in connection with any Fischer plant which might be established in this country. In regard to this suggestion, the Committee have been informed that research on this problem is already being canned out at the Fuel Research Station.196. Yields of products. Information on this point was very difficult to establish. Although samples of the primary products have been obtained for examination in this country, there would appear at present to be no substantial measure of agreement as to what is the best method of treatment, or as to what products would give the most economic return in this country.197. The petrol obtained by distillation is admitted to be of low octane number. It can be improved by cracking, although this involves a material reduction in the yield. A high cetene number diesel oil can be made, although the yield varies considerably according to the method of treating the primary product. It has recently been stated that an aviation spirit has been produced, but no precise information is available of the yields obtained or of the costs.198. A lubricating oil can be produced, but it has proved impossible to obtain definite information as to the stage of develop-ment reached. Samples of oil which have Been supplied for test in this country are not regarded as fully satisfactory. Nevertheless, in recent evidence submitted to the Committee, it was stated that high-grade lubricating oils are being produced, though here again the yields are not known.199. The liquefiable gases can be used either as a basis for the manufacture of further chemical products, such as ketones or polymer gasolines, or, alternatively, they could be sold as liquefied gas for motor vehicles and other purposes. It has been suggested that a large-scale development might lead to the creation of an important chemical industry.200. The Committee have not found it possible, as in other processes, to obtain any data as to the probable quantities of refined products which could be obtained from a given quantity of coal or synthesis gas, as a great deal would depend on the type of coal used and on the product it was mainly desired to obtain. For instance, it would be possible to run the plant primarily for the production of diesel oil, in which case the petrol yield would be smaller, or, on the other hand, if it were desirable to obtain the maximum quantity of the light hydrocarbons, it would be necessary to crack some of the heavier fraction, and the production of diesel oil would be less.201. Statements giving the yields of refined products it is claimed can be obtained from the primary product, together with the estimated value of the refined products, have been submitted, and two such statements are set out below.Estimated yield of products from a plunt producing 85,000 tons of Primary Product per annum.Product.

Information was given to the Committee regarding the possible yields from tests carried out on two samples of primary product which were stated to be representative samples of the total production from a commercial plant.203. The samples were tested with the object of estimating the yields of finished products under the following conditions : (a) For maximum production of (1) 65 octane motor spirit; (2) 74 octane motor spirit.(b) For maximum production of high-speed diesel oil, togetherwith the production of (1) 65 octane motor spirit; (2) 74 octane motor spirit.204. The following table shows the result of the tests (all the percentages shown are by weight of the primary product unless otherwise stated): - 	Spirit Production only, (a)		Production of Spirit, Diesel Oil and Wax. m	Spirit Octane No.......	74	65	74	65Total Motor Spirit......

Provision of Catalyst. This is a matter of considerable, importance, and the arrangements necessary for the manufacture of the catalyst and its periodical purification and regeneration represent a fairly expensive item. The smallest plant which can justify a separate catalyst-making plant is stated to be one of 60,000 tons capacity of primary product. If a smaller plant is established, the cost of the provision for the catalyst will, therefore, be relatively high. It is understood that in Germany there is a central factory for making and supplying the catalyst to a number of plants, and a similar pro-vision would have to be made in this country if the process is developed on a considerable scale.
206. Quantity of Coal required. It was difficult to secure definite data on this point. The Committee were informed that the only guarantee which Ruhrchemie is prepared to give is that a yield of 115 grammes of primary product will be obtained from each cubic metre of synthesis gas. (It was stated in later evidence that this figure has since been materially increased.) As the methods of preparing the synthesis gas vary, it is not possible to be definite regarding the quantity of coal that would be required. The kind of coal, its ash and moisture content, &amp;c, are also factors. But a figure of between 5 and 6 tons of coal per ton of primary product seemed to be generally accepted.207. Financial aspect. Turning to the financial and economic side, the same uncertainty exists owing to the paucity of reliable information and the difficulty, even where figures are obtainable from Germany, of translating these into data which would be applicable to this country.208. Size of Plant and Capital Cost. Statements were furnished to the Committee setting out particulars relating to the recommended size of plant, estimates of the capital and operating costs, the type and yield of products it is claimed can be produced, and estimated realisation value of the products, &amp;c. This information is summarised below: 209. Several views were expressed as to the most suitable size of plant which should be installed in the first instance. The matter is one which depends to a material extent on such factors as the arrange-ments for the manufacture and purification of the catalyst, the method to be adopted for refining the primary product, and the scale of operations which is to be contemplated. Provided suitable arrange-ments can be made for the provision and periodical purification of the catalyst, and for cracking or otherwise refining the primary product, it is apparently the view of Buhrchemie that plants with a capacity of from 25,000/30,000 tons could be regarded as economic units. It seemed to be generally agreed by witnesses, however, that for a self-contained unit, which could economically provide for the manu-facture and periodical purification of the catalyst required, and have its own refining and cracking plant, the capacity should not be less than 60,000 tons per annum of primary product. On the question of what was the smallest plant that would be likely to produce data to determine the suitability of the process in this country the view was expressed that while a pilot plant of 1,000 tons capacity, such as had first been erected in Germany, might produce useful technical information, such information might give no guide to the economics of the process and there would be no commercial incentive in such a venture. It was, therefore, suggested to the Committee that the smallest unit which should be contemplated was one of 20,000 tons capacity. Such a plant would not only provide valuable technical and economic data, but it would enable the nucleus of a staff to be trained which would be available when a larger production was required, and would provide facilities for large scale research to be carried out. It would be also of great assistance in planning further plants if the national interest called for them or commercial concerns desired at any time to establish this type of process.210.   The following are examples of the sizes of plants and estimates of capital cost submitted to the Committee : I. 20,000 ton plant (including coke ovens) ...      ...      ...      ...     1 million to  14 million11.-35,000 ton plant-(A) Including coke ovens 1,901,000(B) Direct gasification of coalin water gas plant 1,717,000III. 60,000 ton plant (including coke ovens and distillation plant)... 3,100,000The estimates of cost have been prepared at different dates, based on information supplied by Buhrchemie.
211. Time needed for the construction of a plant. From the information that has been supplied, it would appear that, under present conditions, it would take about two years to erect a plant (even of 20,000 tons capacity) in this country.212. Costs of production. Until more information is available as to the most suitable methods of treating the primary product in this-country, and of the resulting products which will give the best economic return, it is obviously impossible to obtain any reliable data as to costs of production. One witness gave estimated figures of the average costs of production of marketable products from a 35,000 tons per annum plant which ranged from 12fd. to lod. per gallon, according to the period allowed for amortisation of the capital. The average realisation price taken was 13d. Another stated that, on the basis of the best yields of products which he could at present accept, the overall cost of the primary product would not have to exceed 10^d., and finished products an average of 12fd. per gallon, if proceeds were to equal costs. He had not sufficient data to say whether such results were practicable. Generally the evidence appears to indicate that the costs of production in the case of this process are not likely to be less than those of the hydro-hydrogenation process.213. Depreciation and Obsolescence. One witness gave the Committee a figure of 7 per cent, (representing approximately a 15 years life), on that portion of the capital representing the cost of the plant. Another witness produced a statement showing figures for amortisation of capital over 10, 12, 15 and 20 years; on the basis of the capital being amortised in 20 years, a small balance of profit was shown. The Committee felt, however, that the prices taken for certain products were optimistic, and if they were justified in their criticism, the results would be even less favourable than were shown in the statement submitted to them.214. Government assistance. It is clear from the evidence obtained that a considerable measure of assistance in some form from the Government would be required before any commercial under-taking would contemplate the erection of a plant. As regards the question of the guaranteed preference, the period suggested was usually about 12 years, although a period of 20 years was also-mentioned.215. One witness appeared to be confident that if a guarantee for 12 years were given, private enterprise would find the capital for a plant of a commercial scale. On the other hand, another witness, who at first suggested that, in addition to a guaranteed preference, the Government should find or guarantee three-fourths of the capital for a commercial scale plant, finally wrote to the Committee and gave it as his considered view that the provision of capital for such a venture was not likely to attract outside investors.216. Cannel Coal. One witness informed the Committee that he had been studying the possibility of using cannel coal in connection with the Fischer process. He had come to the conclusion that a plant using cannel as a raw material presented a better commercial pro-position than one utilising coke or bituminous coal as the original material. He was satisfied that it would be possible within two or three years to obtain sufficient supplies of cannel coal for the purpose, and, provided the Government are prepared to guarantee a sufficient measure of assistance, he anticipates that arrangements will be possible to secure the erection of a plant.217. Unless the data to be obtained from such a plant was likely to be of value in determining the economic possibilities of the Fischer process in relation to the utilisation of bituminous coal, and on this point sufficient information was not available to enable the Committee to reach a conclusion, the proposition would, in view7 of the compara-tively limited supplies of cannel coal available in this country, be of local interest only.
9 Q (-J (j o-218. While, the Committee have not been able to obtain data which they could accept as reliable in regard to the points which have been set forth above, there are certain features about the Fischer process which they consider merit closer investigation in this country. These are. more particularly, the possibility of the production of diesel and lubricating oils, unsaturated hydrocarbon gases and high octane fuels. As already stated research work on the process is being carried out at the Fuel Research Station, and the Committee hope that this will be continued. But the Committee were impressed by the views submitted to them by several important witnesses that the determina-tion of the value of the process to this country can only be secured if a plant on a commercial scale is available.Process of Synthetic Oils, Ltd.219. This process, in its main features, is closely allied to the Fischer method, though it differs from it in certain respects, which the Company owning the process claim to be important, and which have been protected by patents.220. The process has been developed during the past few years on an experimental scale by a British group, which includes certain important colliery interests.221. A plant is being built in Scotland at one of the coke oven installations owned by Messrs. Wm. Baird and Co., Ltd.222. Considerable interest is being shown in this development. Messrs. Wm. Baird, the Distillers&apos; Company and others have taken a small financial interest, and the Fuel Research Station is keeping in touch with the Company&apos;s research work.228. The plant now being built, which it is hoped will begin -operations by the end of this year, is designed to have a pro-duction of about 200 tons of petrol a year. This is a small output, but if the experiment is successful it is understood that units of this size will be suitable to form the basis of larger plants.224. The Committee do not feel, however, that at this stage they .can express any opinion on this process.Section III.THE ECONOMIC ASPECT OF THE HOME PRODUCTIONOF OIL.225. The wide publicity which has been given to the fact that it is technically possible to produce oil from coal has, not unnaturally, raised great hopes. This possibility has been seen by some as the salvation of the coal-mining industry, and even in responsible quarters the belief has been expressed that a large increase in prosperity would result from the development of these oil producing processes.226. With these ideas in general there is bound to be much rsympathy, and the desire to have these scientific discoveries translated as quickly as possible into industrial processes for the national benefit is a very laudable one. Certainly it would be a matter of first class importance if it were found practicable to build up, on a sound economic basis, a large new industry based on our great natural asset, -coal.227. But the step from technical achievement to economic success may be a long one, and this is not sufficiently appreciated. As one instance of the confusion which exists in many minds on these matters the statement is frequently made that fuel oil for the navy, should be produced from home sources. The Committee have previously pointed out that this grade of oil is the most easily obtainable of all petroleum products; and is also the cheapest. It is, therefore, the least suitable to be produced by an expensive process which, if operated at all, should be used for the px-oduction of the more costly and less easily obtainable fuels. The same reasoning applies to diesel oil and the lower grades of petrol.
228. From what has been said in Section I, it is clear that in normal times this country has no difficulty in obtaining the oil supplies it requires from overseas. A large proportion of these supplies are the direct result of British enterprise abroad, although the amount produced within the British Empire is small. In addition, comparing the costs of producing oils from materials indigenous to Great Britain as given in Section II, with those of imported supplies (Table 4, Appendix I), there is at present a wide margin in favour of the latter.229. The Committee have given consideration, in paragraphs 37 and 38, to the question whether, with increasing consumption in all parts of the world, the time may come when supplies of petroleum oils may not be so freely available, and in consequence the price may rise. But they cannot see the possibility of a serious advance in world prices occurring within such a period as would justify this factor being taken into account now in any comparison of the costs of supplies from the two sources.230. In these circumstances, it is abundantly evident that, so long as the price of imported fuel remains in the neighbourhood of the present figure, the case for home-produced oil, judged by purely economic standards, falls to the ground. Hence it follows that if it is desirable for any of the reasons mentioned in paragraph 238 to produce oil from coal or other indigenous materials, Government assistance in one form or another must be forthcoming.v     Form and Extent of Present Government Assistance.231. Since 1928, it has been the policy of successive Govern-ments to give some special assistance for the encouragement of the production of oil products from indigenous materials. For when in that year, a duty of 4d. a gallon was placed on motor spirit imported into this country, home-produced motor spirit was exempted. At that date the home production of motor spirit was limited to that obtained from shale oil, and from the carbonisation of coal, the total quantity being inconsiderable. But in 1934, the Government went further and sought to induce private enterprise to provide the capital necessary to secure the commercial scale development of a process for the treatment of coal, where oil was the main product. The inducement took the form of a guaranteed preference over a period of years on all home-produced motor spirit which, besides affording a large measure of protection, provided an element of stability. It was hoped that this would be sufficient to encourage the establishment of the necessary manufacturing plants by enterprising firms.232. A guaranteed preference of not less than id. a gallon was granted for a period of nine years from the 1st April, 1935. The Act provided that if the preference actually granted were greater than 4d., the period should be correspondingly reduced. Owing to the operation of this provision (the preference actually given so far has amounted to 8d. a gallon), the Act is likely to expire in September, 1989: or in four and a half instead of nine years.238. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., made a great effort to secure the benefit of the provisions of the Act, and, following the announcement of Government policy in July, 1938, took steps to construct, as expeditiously as possible, the hydrogenation plant at Billingham, to which reference has been made in Section II. This plant did in fact begin operations on a partial scale just before the beginning of the nine years&apos; period referred to in the previous para-graph : but the time during which the plant has been operating on a considerable scale is too short to enable a definite conclusion to be reached of its ultimate possibilities, and the erection of any further plant by the Company, as a commercial venture, is out of the question under present conditions.234. In addition to the establishment of the hydrogenation plant at Billingham, other definite advantages have already resulted from the Act, even in the short period which has elapsed since 1934. For there has been a material increase in the home production of motor spirit from the by-product industries, while the shale oil industry has probably been saved from extinction.
285. The additional production which has resulted from the guaranteed preference has naturally led to the forgoing by the Exchequer of a considerably increased amount of revenue. The Com-mittee have been informed that, if since the 1st April, 1935, the effective date of operation of the 1984 Act, to the end of 1936, the latest date for which particulars are available, the whole of the home-produced motor spirit had been replaced by imported spirit, the extra revenue which the Exchequer would have received would have been about  5,120,000. When considering the cost to the Exchequer, however, other factors have to be taken into account, such as the beneficial effect of home production on employment, and the taxation leviable upon profits arising from the home industries. It is difficult to estimate what proportion of the additional production from the by-product industries has been due to the operation of the Act, but taking the production from hydrogenation and the shale oil industry only, the value of the. extra revenue which would have been received would be  2,250,000. From the Exchequer point of view oil from coal processes have thus been encouraged to a considerable extent.236. The Chancellor of the Exchequer could have reduced the amount of the preference by imposing an excise duty up to Ad. a gallon on home-produced spirit, and this would have maintained the guaranteed preference over a longer period; but no such action has been taken. The automatic shortening of the period of the guarantee to four and a half years will mean that in the near future a review of the Government policy will have to take place.287. Heavy oils produced from indigenous &quot;materials have, since 1988, received a preference of Id. per gallon, and diesel oil used in motor vehicles, a preference of 8d. per gallon since August, 1935, although without a guarantee such as applies in the case of motor spirit.Reasons advanced for Stimulating Home Production.238. The reasons advanced for the desirability of producing oil from home sources are : (a) provision of employment;(b) technical and industrial development:(c) defence.. (a) Employment.289. The Committee have given much thought to this aspect of the question, for they fully realise how important it would be, as a contribution towards solving the unemployment problem, if there were a real possibility of establishing a great new industry. They have, therefore, carefully examined each of the groups of processes for obtaining oil from coal and other indigenous materials in the light of the additional employment which might be provided. Taking each group in the order in which they have been previously examined in Section II, the conclusions the Committee have arrived at are set out below : 240. The Shale Oil Industry.-The Scottish Shale Oil Industry, after a long period of great difficulty, is now, largely as a result of the preference granted to home-produced oil, making a moderate commercial profit and finds employment for some 4,800 persons  see paragraph 64.241. It is possible, if the continuance of the preference were assured, that a further expansion might take place, and that in the course of a few years the output of the industry might be doubled. The investigations of the Committee do not lead them to anticipate, however, that any great increase beyond this is practicable.242. The Gas and Coke Oven Industries.-1h.eae industries are long established and their output is regulated mainly by the demand for their primary products, i.e., gas and coke, rather than by the production of liquid by-products. If the smaller gas undertakings stripped their gas for benzole, a few more men might find employ-ment, but the numbers&quot; would be small.
243. Low Temperature Carbonisation. The development of this type of process has been strongly advocated by some as a means for re-establishing the coal mining industry.244. As indicated in paragraph 120, the main product of the industry is an alternative solid fuel for one that is already in use. In paragraph 124 it is stated that it has been estimated that some 10 per cent, more coal would have to be mined to produce, on the basis of thermal value, an amount of fuel equivalent to the coal now used. More men would be employed in the mining industry to the extent of the increased output, and, in addition, employment would be offered in the carbonising plants and in manufacturing the plants, but this would not be great.245. As against the possibility of some additional employment the Committee have already drawn attention in paragraph 125 to the views expressed by the representatives of the coal industry as to the possible adverse effects which might arise in other directions on that industry should there be a large development of low temperature carbonisation.246. In order that low temperature carbonisation might provide any substantial amount of additional employment it would be necessary that a very large development should take place. The Committee have examined this possibility in paragraph 126, and they do not consider that it is likely to happen within a reasonable period.247. Hydrogenation and Synthetic Processes. The limitations which have been referred to in the cases already dealt with do not arise with these processes: for the main product is oil, and there is no residual solid fuel to be disposed of in competition with coal. The successful operation on a large scale of these processes would, therefore, produce an entirely new demand for coal, and offer greater opportunities for the creation of employment in the mining industry, as well as directly at the plants. Since, however, the development of these processes cannot be achieved on a strictly economic basis, it becomes necessary to consider at what cost the additional employ-ment could be provided in present circumstances.248. Hydrogenation Process.&apos; The information supplied to the Committee indicates that for this process a plant with a production capacity of 150,000 tons per annum of motor spirit would afford direct employment to some 2,000 persons on the plant, and a further 4,000 in the mining and secondary industries, giving a total employ-ment figure of 6,000. Unfortunately, the cost of erecting such a plant is very great, amounting, on the basis of the present cost of wages and materials, to about  8,000,000. This would work out at a capital cost of a l,338 per man employed. In addition, on the basis of the present preference of 8d. per gallon, there would be a loss of revenue to the Exchequer which would represent at least  250 per annum per man. The cost of providing work by this means would, therefore, be very high. It would represent from the Revenue point of view alone a continuing assistance amounting to about  5 per week per person employed.249. Synthetic Processes. Though reliable figures are not available for these processes, the information furnished to the Committee indicates that they are not likely to be very different from those given lor the hydrogenation process.250. The Committee, therefore, find themselves driven to the conclusion that, viewed solely from the point of view of providing a large measure of employment, the hydrogenation and synthetic processes do not at present offer a very hopeful prospect, in relation to the cost which would be involved. In this view they are supported by one important witness, who, while advocating the development of these processes for other reasons, used the following words as regards their effect on employment: &quot; Any idea that oil from coal can provide sudden salvation for the coal industry is clearly foolish.&quot;(b) Technical and Industrial Development.251. This aspect of the question raises considerations which are of a somewhat different order. It is admitted in most quarters that the developments which are taking place in the hydrogenation and
synthetic processes offer possibilities which may, at a future date, be of great value to this country. The question therefore arises whether, on this ground, it is desirable to take any special action to expedite the progress which is being made.252. The witnesses who have given evidence before the Com-mittee have represented a wide range of views. Some, even though they see little hope of the production of oil products from indigenous materials becoming an economic proposition within a reasonable period, nevertheless suggested that the matter ought to be closely watched, and that research on an adequate scale should be continued. Others pressed that the time had come when commercial scale production should be expedited with such additional assistance from the Exchequer as might be necessary.253. The Committee agree that research should be continued, but it is also clear to them that, in order properly to assess the technical and industrial possibilities of these processes, some develop-ment on a commercial scale of operations is necessary.254. The Committee have drawn attention to what is being done in Germany and certain other countries, and they have pointed out that there are good reasons why this country should not necessarily follow closely the action which is being taken abroad. Nevertheless, they feel that Great Britain cannot afford to lag behind other countries in exploring, on a sufficiently large scale, processes of this character which may ultimately prove to be of benefit, not only in regard to the production of oil, but also perhaps in providing raw materials for the chemical industry.255. It is important that this country should be able to have experience at first hand of the working of these new processes, and it is essential, in the view of the Committee, that there should be trained a sufficient personnel with the necessary technical experience related to such processes. It has often been said of this country that we are too prone to allow others to work out inventions and build up new industries.   There may be some truth in the criticism.256. The Committee consider that it would be unfortunate if a lack of enterprise were to be shown in the case of these oil from coal processes, more particularly as this country possesses great quantities of suitable raw material. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., have carried out tests on coals from a number of districts which might be suitable for the hydrogenation process, with satisfactory results. In the case of South Wales, the tests were conducted at the expense of the Government, and the Company are satisfied that sufficient quantities of coal are available to provide what would be required for a plant in that area. The synthetic process would, in the early stages of development, probably use coking, or a blend of coking and non-coking, coals. Neither the hydrogenation nor the synthetic processes can, unfortunately, at present use the hard steam coals produced in South Wales, the markets for which have seriously declined. In the case of the synthetic process, the Committee understand that it may be possible to make the synthesis gas from such coals.257. As to the actual scale of operations which would be necessary, to achieve what the Committee have in mind, there may be some difference of opinion. But the Committee feel that, if really useful experience is to be obtained, the size of future plants to be installed should not be less than will provide technical and economic data which could be used to determine the possibilities of large-scale development.(e) Defence.258.   This aspect of the question is dealt with in Section IV.Further Development in Peace Time and Assistance Proposed.259. The Committee have given the most careful consideration to the action which they consider should be taken in order to secure the maintenance of the present interest, and that measure of further development which in their view is called for.[16564] f 2
an-260. Most of the proposals submitted to the Committee have involved a large measure of Government assistance, including both an extension of the guaranteed preference for a number of years, and some form of provision of capital. So far, except in one or two cases of low temperature carbonisation plants, dealt with under the Special Areas Acts, the Government have not granted direct financial assistance.261. The Committee agree that, so far, the results of the hydro-hydrogenation and synthetic processes are not sufficiently established to justify the spending of large sums of public money in building plants. They feel, however, that serious interest is only likely to be maintained if there continues to be available a measure of assistance which will give commercial concerns a prospect of a reasonable financial return. The Committee therefore favour a continuation of the form of assistance at present given by the guaranteed preference. They consider, however, that a higher rate than 4d. is necessary and that the guarantee should cover a longer period than has proved to be available under the present Act.262. Experience gained before the passing of the 1934 Act clearly showed that a preference alone without a guarantee, even if it be the large amount such as was then carried on from year to year by the Finance Act, did not provide a sufficient incentive to industrial concerns to invest money in new developments. This was particularly the case with the processes designed to produce oil as the primary product, where large capital expenditure was involved; but it applied also to the existing carbonisation and shale oil industries, where new and up-to-date plant had necessarily to be installed if an increased yield of oil products was to be obtained.263. One of the difficulties with the processes designed for the production of oil as the primary product is that not only are the large-scale plants expensive to build, but in the earlier stages, one of the main factors which renders them commercially unprofitable is the heavy allowance required to be made under the head of obsolescence. For, as improvements are discovered, it is often impossible to apply them without extensive alterations or reconstruc-tion of plant.264. Experience may indeed show that a guaranteed preference, even of a larger amount than is at present afforded, will not result in further plants being built. If that should prove to be the case, then there will be no further loss of revenue to the Exchequer. If, on the other hand, there should be some further forgoing of revenue, it will be because private enterprise has been willing to do its part in attempting to carry further these important developments.265. The Committee are of opinion that the amount of assistance at present required is certainty not less than the rate of preference at present actually given, viz., 8rf. a gallon. They also consider that a preference at this rate should be guaranteed for a period of 12 years from 1938, and that it should apply to diesel oil for use in motor vehicles as well as to motor spirit. The period suggested may appear to be a long one, but a considerable time is required to build new plants, and experience at Billingham has clearly shown that after the plant is completed much time is required to deal with -difficulties which emerge with commercial scale working.266. If this recommendation is accepted by the Government, the Committee are hopeful that some of the commercial interests which have been investigating the synthetic process would be prepared to establish a Fischer plant of a sufficient size to give commercial data. There would then, as a minimum, be two commercial scale plants in this country, one for each of the processes designed primarily to produce oil. With a degree of protection such as the Committee recommend, they hope that from these developments some further expansion will result in the course of a few years. If the very substantial incentive suggested, amounting to something approaching a 200 per cent, protective tariff, fails to achieve results, then it would
only be reasonable to conclude that these processes are at present so far removed from economic success that any other form of assistance would not be justified.267. Without a continuance of help of this kind, the Committee are of opinion that the production of oil products from the earbonisa-tion industries will also decline. In regard to these industries, the Committee consider that it is a sound policy to secure the fullest possible recovery of by-products obtainable in the treatment of coal; and, while these industries cannot in the nature of things make a really large contribution to the oil supplies needed by this country, the Committee would regard it as a retrograde step if this source of production were to be reduced through the withdrawal of the assistance now given. In addition, as the Committee have already pointed out, the shale oil industry would again lapse into a parlous condition, at a time when, as they were informed, there are definite prospects of its activities being extended.268. In putting forward the particular form of assistance suggested, the Committee are advocating the adoption of a long-term policy which they believe, in the circumstances, is the correct policy to adopt.269. In view, however, of the fact that the amount of the guaranteed preference which theyT recommend is equal to the present rate of duty on imported motor spirit and road diesel oil, the Committee have considered whether it is practicable to provide the Exchequer with means, in substitution for those which are provided in the Act of 1934, for protecting the revenue,v should a material change in existing conditions take place. Under the existing Act there is a margin of -id. per gallon between the amount of the guaranteed preference and the rate of preference actually granted. It is thus possible, without interfering with the guarantee, to protect the revenue to a great extent, either by means of an excise duty or by shortening the period. Under the Committee&apos;s proposal that possibility will no longer exist. Moreover, if the guarantee is to achieve its object, it is important, in the view of the Committee, that any change for which it might be considered necessary to provide, should clearly be related to definite factors which can be prescribed in the legislation giving effect to the guarantee. The Committee have recommended a guaranteed preference of 8d. per gallon because they are convinced that this measure of assistance is necessary under present conditions to help those processes which are primarily con-cerned with the production of oil. If the present competitive position of home-produced oils were to improve, the Committee agree that it would not be unreasonable to re-assess the amount of the preference, should a satisfactory basis for doing this be established.270. In this connection the Committee consider that it is&apos; only fair to point out that, while it is hoped that the margin between the overall costs of production of home-produced oil and the price of imported oil may lessen, certain factors may operate to cause the present margin in favour of imported oil to increase still further. These factors are the possibility of increases in the cost of materials (including coal) and wages in connection with oil from coal plants, and a decrease in the c.i.f. values of imported oils. It would only be possible to meet such a contingency by the grant of direct financial assistance, which the Committee do not recommend, and they are of opinion that the risk is one which those who may undertake the development of oil from coal processes will have to face.271. On the other hand, the chief factors which may strengthen the competitive position of home-produced oils are (1) a material increase in the price of imported oils; (2) a large decrease in the cost of the principal raw material  coal; and(8) improvements in the technique of the processes of such an extent as would lower costs of production.272. In regard to (1), the Committee consider that it should not be difficult to make provision to cover this possibility.   It would be
necessary to fix a datum period, and this, it is suggested, should be-the year 1937. Particulars are published in the Trade and Naviga-tion Returns of the average declared c.i.f. values of motor spirit and gas oil, and these would appear to provide a sufficient measure of any changes in the landed cost of motor spirit and road diesel oil. The Committee propose that if in respect of the year 1941, or any subsequent year, the average declared c.i.f. value of motor spirit or gas oil has exceeded the average figures for 1937 by not less than Id. per gallon, the amount of the guaranteed preference on motor spirit and road diesel oil respectively should be reduced by one \d. per gallon in respect of the first Id. of the-excess, and for each additional \d. of the excess beyond Id., a further reduction of \d.273. In regard to (2), the Committee have pointed out in paragraph 170 that each Is. increase or decrease in the price of coal makes a difference of -16d. in the cost of petrol per gallon in the case of the hydrogenation process. A somewhat similar figure would probably also apply to the Fischer process. The price of coal would therefore have to vary by about 6s. a ton to affect the production cost of motor spirit to the extent of Id. per gallon. The possibility of such a fall in the 1937 level of coal prices appears to the Committee to be so remote that they suggest that no provision need be made to&apos; cover this factor.274. As regards (3), the Committee recognise that this is a more difficult factor to provide for. They gave consideration to the possibility&apos;of limiting the proposed new rate of guaranteed preference to a certain number of new plants; but they felt that there were substantial objections to such a course, the more important of which are : (a) that it would involve discrimination as between one process and another; and (b) that it may hamper work in the earlier stages of new processes. The present guaranteed preference is available to all processes for producing motor spirit from indigenous materials, and the Committee are of opinion that there is a considerable advantage in preserving that basis under any extension of the preference.275. It is quite evident from the enquiries which the Committee have made that considerable improvements in technique would have to be effected in order to achieve any substantial saving in working costs. Such a possibility might, however, occur; and if it should eventuate, the Committee realise that, not only would it afford to&apos; those then engaged in the industry unduly high profits, but it would lead to a large increase in production, as existing undertakings would expand and new undertakings would spring up. The Committee therefore suggest that power might be taken in the legislation for a reduction in the amount of the guaranteed preference of Id. per gallon, should production from home sources of motor spirit or road diesel oil reach in 1941, or in any subsequent year, 20 per cent, of the home consumption, and that a further reduction of Id. per gallon might be effected for each additional 5 per cent.276. The Committee appreciate that numerous alternative sliding scales could be framed, and they have submitted that suggested above merely as a basis for consideration. They have, however, in putting forward the proposal, borne in mind &quot;the present situation and the present tendencies in regard to imported and home-produced oils,&apos; which may briefly be summarised as follows: Home-produced motor spirit represents about 7 per cent, of the total consumption. The&apos; average annual increase in total consumption over the last few years has been in the neighbourhood of 6 per cent., and in the absence of specially untoward circumstances, it is to be presumed that the con-sumption will still expand, although possibly at not so high a rate. From the above figures it will be realised that if each year the home production of oil increased by an amount representing 100 per cent, of its present level, this would do little more, than take up the growth in total consumption; in other words, while the growth in the volume of imported motor fuels might be entirely arrested, the actual imports of these oils would not be diminished to any appreciable extent.
277. The following pro forma calculation, based on a total consumption of 100 gallons, is of interest : The position at the present time is that on 98 gallons there is collected 8d. while on the remaining 7 gallons nothing is collected    ...      ...      744d.If, under the sliding scale, the home production reached 20 per cent, of the total, the guaranteed preference is reduced from 8d. to 7rf. The position would then be as follows : On 80 gallons there would he collected 8d. per gallon ..................      640d.On 20 gallons there could be collected Id. per gallon ..................        20d.660d.If the home production reached 40 per cent, of the total consumption, then under the sliding scale the guaranteed preference on the home production would be reduced to 3d. The following would then be the position : On 60 gallons there would be collected 8d. per gallon ..................      480d.On 40 gallons there could be collected 5d. per gallon ..................      200d.680d.While the above calculation shows a substantial loss to the Exchequer with home production at 20 per cent, of the total -consumption, as compared with the position at present, it must be remembered that no account is taken of the probable further expan-sion of total consumption, from which the Exchequer would, of course, derive benefit.278. With provisions on the lines they have proposed, the Committee suggest that the Exchequer would be reasonably safeguarded.Section IV.THE POSITION IN TIME OP WAR.279. The proposal has frequently been put forward that arrange-ments should be made for the production of large quantities of hydrocarbon oils from home resources as a means of supplying, or at any rate materially supplementing the supply of, these very important oils in time of war.280. Before it is possible to form any conclusion on the merits of this proposal, it is necessary to consider the estimated require-ments of the country, including both civil and Service needs, in time of war, and the methods by which it is intended to meet these requirements. It will then be possible in the light of the information -contained in Sections II and III to assess the contribution wrhieh home-produced oil might make.281. As the whole question of Empire oil requirements is kept -constantly under review by a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Committee have not felt it necessary to do more than acquaint themselves with the main facts furnished by that committee, in order that they might be in a position to consider the second part of their Terms of Reference &quot;on the advantages to be obtained by way of security of oil supplies in emergency.&quot;Home Production compared with imported sup2)lies.282. In making a comparison between the two methods of meeting the country&apos;s needs, viz., home production or supplies from, overseas, there are a number of factors to be examined. Those which affect peace time conditions have been dealt with in Section III, and the Committee propose in this Section to confine themselves to ;the more important of those which are relevant to war time problems.
277.   The following pro forma calculation, based on a total -consumption of 100 gallons, is of interest : The position at the present time is that on 93  gallons  there is  collected  8d.   while  on  the remaining 7 gallons nothing is collected    ...      ...      744(7.If, under the sliding scale, the home production reached 20 per cent, of the total, the guaranteed preference is reduced from 8d. to 7*7. The position would then be as follows : On 80 gallons there would be collected 8d. per gallon        ..................      640d.On 20 gallons there could be collected Id. per gallon        ...............      ...       20d.660d.If the home production reached 40 per cent, of the total consumption, then under the sliding scale the guaranteed preference on the home production would be reduced to 3d. The following would then be the position : On 60 gallons there would be collected 8d. per gallon ..................      480d.On 40 gallons there could be collected od. per gallon ............      200d.680d.While the above calculation shows a substantial loss to the Exchequer with home production at 20 per cent, of the total -consumption, as compared with the position at present, it must be remembered that no account is taken of the probable further expan-sion of total consumption, from which the Exchequer would, of course, derive benefit.278. With provision? on the lines they have proposed, the Committee suggest that the Exchequer would be reasonably safeguarded.Section IV.THE POSITION IN TIME OF WAE.279. The proposal has frequently been put forward that arrange-ments should be made for the production of large quantities of hydrocarbon oils from home resources as a means of supplying, or at any rate materially supplementing the supply of, these very important oils in time of war.280. Before it is possible to form any conclusion on the merits -of this proposal, it is necessary to consider the estimated require-ments of the country, including both civil and Service needs, in time -of war, and the methods by which it is intended to meet these requirements. It will then be possible in the light of the information -contained in Sections II and III to assess the contribution which home-produced oil might make.281. As the whole question of Empire oil requirements is kept -constantly under review by a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Committee have not felt it necessary to do more than acquaint themselves with the main facts furnished by that committee, in order that they might be in a position to consider the second part of their Terms of reference &apos;&apos; on the advantages to be obtained by way of security of oil supplies in emergency.&quot;Home Production compared with imported supplies.282. In making a comparison between the two methods of meeting the country&apos;s needs, viz., home production or supplies from overseas, there are a number of factors to be examined. Those which affect peace time conditions have been dealt with in Section III, and the Committee propose in this Section to confine themselves to .the more important of those which are relevant to war time problems.
283. In Section II, it has been shown that it is possible to produce oil from indigenous resources by different methods: but the only methods which can be looked upon as potential sources of large supplies of oil are the hydrogenation and the Fischer or similar processes.284. On account of the low octane number of its motor spirit, and the lack of knowledge concerning the possible yields of high-grade oils, the Fischer process must still be considered, in spite of the development it has undergone in Germany, to be of uncertain value so far as the needs of this country are concerned. For the time being, therefore, it is to the hydrogenation of coal that the country would have to look if it were desired substantially to increase the output of oil from home resources; under present conditions the use of this process for the production of light oils is the only possibility which need be seriously considered.285. The most important of the factors which should be taken into consideration as affecting the war time problems appear to the Committee to be (A) Assurance of the extra supplies to meet the increased wartime demand.(B) Effect on man-power.(C) Relative cost.(A) Assurance of extra supplies.286. The present position with regard to the home production of oil is that, while some 7 per cent, of the motor spirit used is produced in this country, the amounts of fuel oil, lubricating oil and other products are negligible. It will be seen, therefore, that, in order to play even a relatively minor part in supplying the oil required in time of war, a very great expansion in home production would have to take place. Such an expansion would mean the establishment of a number of large plants, involving heavy capital expenditure, and, because of the need for special steel and large forgings, would take a number of years to effect.287. It would not be practicable to allow the plants to remain idle until an emergency arose, for, if they were to do so, the difficulties of starting them up, of securing the supplies of coal, and obtaining trained technicians, would be considerable, and dangerous delay might result. They would, therefore, have to operate as and when they were completed. As the additional home production became available it would be balanced by a corresponding decrease of imports in peace time. At the present time there is a complete and efficient transport and distribution organisation supplying the needs of this country, and should the decrease in imports reach substantial proportions it is inevitable that it would ultimately result in the reduction in the facilities provided by the oil industry, and this might seriously prejudice the position in an emergency.288. In order that the great increase in consumption due to emergency demand may be met, it is essential that the source from which the normal supplies are drawn, whatever the means used for providing them, must be capable of great and rapid expansion. From what has already been said, it will be appreciated that it would take a considerable time, in the case of home production, to obtain the necessary extra supplies by the establishment of yet additional oil from coal plants. In the case of imported supplies, however, the possibilities of rapid expansion of output are much greater, always provided the facilities referred to in the last part of the previous paragraph are available. This is much more likely to be the case if in peace time the normal trade of the oil industry is maintained at the highest possible level.289. Much stress has been laid, by those who advocate the encouragement of-home production of oil, on the greater security which the country would obtain as compared with reliance on imported supplies. It is reasonable to assume that a large proportion of the tankers required for our oil imports would escape enemy attack. Furthermore, in the transport of seaborne oil, and also in the case of storage in this country, the risks would be spread over a very large
number of units, and, though losses would be inevitable, the policy of storage and replenishment from overseas should provide adequate security for our oil requirements.290. In the case of hydrogenation plants, on the other hand, the risks would be concentrated. The plants must of necessity be large, and would therefore provide conspicuous targets and be extremely vulnerable to air attack.(B) Man-Power.291. It is clear that the reliance on imported supplies would not entail large additional demands on man-power. On the contrary, according to information based on experience at Billingham, if hydro-hydrogenation plants were established, for example, to produce 1 million tons of motor spirit per annum (which would represent only a small proportion of the countiVs needs), these plants would require nearly 80,000 persons for the supply of the necessary coal and the working of the plants, in addition to a considerable number in secondary industries. If these plants had to be multiplied, as they would have to be if reliance on this means of meeting emergency requirements were accepted, considerable additional demands would be made on man-power for the erection and subsequently for working the plants; apart from the very important question of the time which would be required for their establishment. In addition, further substantial supplies of coal would be needed. Accordingly, from the point of view of demand on man-power, home production is at a disadvantage compared with imported supplies^(C) Cost.292. The factor of cost can be divided into two sections, (1) the capital cost, (2) the annual cost.(1) Capital cost. As has been explained previously, the capital cost of a hydrogenation plant is high. To provide a production of one million tons of motor spirit, the total capital cost of the the necessary plants would be  50 million. It has been suggested by some advocates of home production that considerable capital expenditure would be saved by the development of oil from coal plants, on the assumption that a greatly reduced storage capacity would be required. The Committee have paid careful attention to this view. It appears to them, however, that the storage capacity required, if oil were produced from home resources, would be very little different from that which would be necessary if the same amount of spirit were imported. Modern war will probably consist of periods of intense activity followed by comparatively quiet periods. There-fore, to meet the peak demand and to give the security necessary should the hydrogenation plants suffer from enemy action or by interruption of working from other causes, very considerable storage arrangements, both of the necessary raw materials as well as of finished oil products, would be required, and there would thus be very little difference in cost between the two alternatives on this account.293. Incidentally, the Committee would point out that for a capital expenditure of  8 million, the cost of one hydrogenation plant with an output of 150,000 tons of motor spirit, 82 tankers of 11,200 tons cargo capacity, could be built, which, allowing for 5 voyages a year only, could bring to this country 1,800,000 tons, or twelve times the output of a single hydrogenation plant.294. (2) Annual cost. It has been explained above that although the suggested hydrogenation plants were erected to help ease the position in time of war, yet, as soon as they were installed, they would have to commence production. Every gallon of motor spirit produced would result in the Exchequer losing revenue to the extent under existing conditions of the amount of the preference of 8d., or  10 per ton, and even comparing this with the most expensive class of storage, including all charges, the cost to the Exchequer would show a balance in favour of storage.   As the hydrogenation plants
might operate in peace time for an indefinite period with the possibility that sooner or later they might play a part in a national emergency, it is clear that a very heavy loss of revenue by the Exchequer would be involved. In respect of the example chosen of a production of I million tons of motor spirit per annum, the Exchequer would lose  10 million each year. Unless the plants were self-supporting, further annual charges would arise representing interest on capital and any deficiency which might exist between-proceeds and costs of production.295. The Committee have endeavoured to carry this examination further and to find a basis of comparison of costs in time of war. It may very well happen that the price of imported motor spirit will increase by a substantial amount, and in such circumstances it is possible that motor spirit produced from coal might be obtained at a cost comparable with that of imported supplies. But, on the basis of existing information, there is a substantial balance in favour of imported spirit.296. The Committee feel, however, that it is impracticable for them to put forward any reliable data as to what would happen under war time conditions in regard to such important factors as (1) the possible movement of prices of imported spirit;(2) the changes in the costs of materials, wages, &amp;c, which may affect the cost of home-produced spirit: or (3) the position in regard to taxation.All these would be dependent on another indeterminable factor  the duration of the war.297. The Committee are therefore unable to reach a definite conclusion of any value on the question of relative costs of the two alternatives in war time.Supplies from home refineries.298. The Committee have been informed that consideration has been given to the possibility of arranging for the establishment in this country of a special refinery which, in an emergency, would be used for the treatment of reserves of suitable crude oils, the storage of which would be undertaken in peace time. The Committee are informed, however, that this method, for several reasons, is not attractive.299. The Committee also took evidence on the question of the desirability of encouraging home refining generally in this country, but they are satisfied that the objections outweigh any possible advantages.300.   Among the outstanding disadvantages, are : (1) Refineries would offer considerable targets for hostile aircraft.(2) In the operation of refining there is an appreciable loss of the crude oil. A larger amount of tanker tonnage would therefore be required to enable the necessary volume of crude oil to be transported to this country for refining here, as compared with the amount of tonnage necessary for the transport of an equivalent quantity of refined products. Such an increased demand on tanker tonnage would not be desirable at a time when all available tonnage should be used to the best advantage; while the importation of crude and subsequent refining would necessitate additional handling and transport in this country.(8) It might not be practicable to ensure that at a given time the output of refined products from the crude oil available, would correspond to the particular needs of the country; and if. there were any interruption in the supply of the classes of crude oils for the treatment of which the refineries were designed, there would be serious delay in carrying out the necessary adjustments to deal with crudes from other sources.
801. The Committee have come to the conclusion, as the result of their examination of the various important factors, that in general a policy of depending on imported supplies with adequate storage, is the most reliable and economical means of providing for an emergency; and they cannot recommend the reliance of the country in war time on supplies of oil from indigenous sources especially established for this purpose, unless any particular aspect of the case can be shown to be exceptional.Note. It would not be in the national interest to publish particulars of the Committee&apos;s enquiries into such aspects. Very detailed examination has been given to them and a confidential report and recommendations have been forwarded to the Committee of Imperial Defence.Section V. RECOMMENDATIONS. (Apart from those dealing with confidential matters.) Extension for further Period of Guaranteed Preference.It is quite evident to the Committee that if there is to be further development of the production of oil from coal on any important scale, or, indeed, if the production of even the existing amount of oil products from home resources is to be maintained, a continuance of a guaranteed preference on home-produced spirit is essential. In existing circumstances the Committee have expressed the view that the amount of the preference necessary is not less than 8d. a gallon, which is the present rate of preference now given, but double the amount of the guaranteed preference. /The Committee, therefore, strongly recommend the continuance of a guaranteed preference for a period of 12 years from 1938, the rate being increased from Ad. to 8d. per gallon, and the guarantee extended to include diesel oil for use in motor vehicles.The Committee have considered whether it is practicable to suggest any measures which might be taken to safeguard the Exchequer against (a) a declining revenue from the duty on imported oils; and(b) an excessive preference to the home-producing oil industry.It appears to the Committee that it should be practicable to meet these contingencies and in paragraphs 269 to 277 they have made suggestions as to the manner in which they consider such safeguards might be provided.Low Temperature Carbonisation.(1) The Committee recommend that assistance to this industry should be limited to participation in the benefits to be derived from the guaranteed preference on home-produced oils. It will thus be afforded the same assistance as the other carbonisation industries. The Committee consider that the grant of direct financial assistance for the establishment of further plants cannot be justified.(2) The Committee consider that the facilities provided by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for carrying out, free of charge, an official test of low temperature carbonisation plants should be continued; but that the tests and the reports thereon should cover all technical points connected with the operation of, and the products of the process, and not merely with the carbonisation aspect.Synthetic Processes.The Committee consider that it would be of considerable advan-tage if the establishment of a plant to work the Fischer process, and designed for the production of not less than 20-30,000 tons of primary products per annum could be secured. They hope that, with the extension of the guaranteed preference, one or more industrial concerns may be induced to undertake the erection of such a plant. [16564] n
But if financial assistance is requested from the Government, the Committee recommend that such assistance should be limited to sums required for special items of research work which, by agreement with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, can be recom-mended as being of national interest.Scottish Shale Oil Industry.This is a small, though important, industry. The recommenda-tion of the Committee for a continuance of the guaranteed preference under the first recommendation above should be of great assistance in encouraging its development.In submitting their report to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, the Sub-Committee drew special attention to the fact that much of the information contained in the report was supplied to them by witnesses representing commercial concerns on the understanding that it would not be made public. In addition, much of the evidence furnished by Government Departments was of a highly confidential character.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed that the conditions under which evidence was given before the Sub-Committee precluded publication of the report in full.The confidential matter has accordingly been deleted from the report, and the Sub-Committee have considered the report so amended. They desire to inform the Minister that they approve the report in the form as now submitted.(Signed)      FALMOUTH (Chairman). A. L. AYRE. A. E. CUTFORTH. A. C. EGERTON.F. C. StablingA. D.
