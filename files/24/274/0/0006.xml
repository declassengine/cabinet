S $9(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS . BRITANNIC JAJBSTY&apos;S Q-QVBRNMENT)SECRET.- Copy No. S       ^C.P.  6 (38).cabinet public CAPITAL expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering Reports by an Inter-Departmental Committee.1. I circulate,  for the consideration of the Cabinet,two reports drawn up by an Inter-Departmental Committee which was appointed in May last to enquire into the question of public capital expenditure with special reference to the suggestions made upon that subject in the Report of the Economic Advisory Committee dated 19th February last.In P.C.E.   (37)10 the Inter-Departmental Committee summarise the views of the Economic Advisory Council (sV 2 to 6); set out the principal difficulties which experience has shown to arise in connection with public works expenditure (s^ 7 to 14&apos;) and set out their own general conclusions ($15).      The remainder of the Report is an analysis of the subject as it affects the responsibility of different Government Departments, followed in ^90 by the recommendations of the Committee.      In consequence of the fairly severe set-back in the United Gtates and the threat of a minor set-back in this country which developed towards the end of the year the Inter-Departmental Committee has drawn up a supplementary Report P.C.E.   (37)15 in the light of the changed position.The Inter-Departmental Committee indicate that the contribution which the Government can make towards
stabilising employment by a skilful timing of the capital expenditure for which it is responsible is not unimportant,&quot; though on the other hand it is not on so considerable a scale as to solve the problem.      Taking the normal annual capital expenditure controlled by the State as approximately  250 million,  it appears that&apos; this figure might be reduced by deliberate action in times of abundant employment by an proximately  20 million a year and increased in times of depression by approximately  30 millions a year above the general average i.e. by  50 million a year above the lowest level.      At the time of the first Report the case for making the maximum restriction practicable in Government and municipal capital expenditure gained further support from the heavy demands which the rearmament programme is making on the available supply of labdur in the main constructional industries.    Although these demands continue there has been some falling off in total employment recently and it cannot be claimed that at the present time the re-armament programme is suffering any general delay from a shortage of labour in the building industry except perhaps in the special case of Scotland.      It has become more difficult for the Government to take public action which might be read as indicating an intention on its part to restrict the activities of local authorities.      Accordingly in their second Report p. c-E.  (37)15 the Inter-Departmental Committee recommends that so far as Local Authorities are concerned the action taken should be limited, to a request to them to prepare an ordered programme of the building works they propose to carry out over the next five years.      In view of existing high costs and the short supply of some materials it may be anticipated that the authorities if working to a programme will tend to accumulate the greater part of the expenditure in the latter part of the period,  a tendency which should be encouraged by the Departments concerned with supervision.
2. I desire to add the following observations.A boom in the constructional industries such as existed in the first half on 1937 and still exists though at a slightly-lower level is in itself a highly desirable thing.      It is not as though we were considering a kind of fever chart in which an excess of temperature over normal is equally dangerous with a deficit below normal.,      As the Inter-Departmental Committee observes, the argument that it is wise at any time to restrict employment supposing a reserve of labour to exist is one that it is very difficult to accept.      Why should men be refused employment now merely on the ground or supposition that some better employment may possibly be provided for them later?Nevertheless a boom in constructional industry is accompanied by two serious drawbacks.      In the first place it may lead to increased costs for&apos;&quot;wages ana materials. Costs rise fast but it is a slow and very difficult process to get them down later.      This is one reason why a &quot;boom is follow-ed by a long depressiono      The danger of an excessive rise in costs was very real in the middle of last year.      It may not be very far away even now taut it has certainly receded somewhat and it is rather the following consequence of a constructional boom which we have to consider.In an old settled country the population of whichis no longer expanding capital projects are Toy no meansabundant.      House-building and more recently rearmament arethe essential causes of the activity of recent years.      Althoughrearmament will continue for several years it will as timegoes on take more the form of actual output and less that ofconstructional activity.      A substantial falling off in houseconstruction   must become an urgent problem at no distant date.There were ap-^roximatly 8,000,000 houses in . england andWales at the time of the Armistice and 3,500,000 have been added since,  1,500,000 in the last five years.     As private house building falls off its place may in greater or less degree be taken by State and municipal activity in the-3-
housing field,  which is usually found to be very expensive to the public.      Whether we are considering private or municipal building, however,  and whether it is a question of adding more houses or of replacing existing houses the fact remains that we cannot go on as in the last five years constructing houses at a rate which would produce 30 million houses in a century or,  as the Inter-Departmental Committee puts it,, at a rate which would replace the whole of the houses in the country in little over a single generation.      The signs of a falling off in activity are apparent now, even though monetary and trade conditions are still entirely favourable to house building.    A severe decline must obviously be reckoned with and there is grave reason to fear that this may coincide in point of time with a severe decline in such parts of the rearmament programme as affect constructional activity.      I do not see that this can affect 1938 or 1939 except possibly the end of the latter year.    None of these arguments of the Economic Advisory Committee or of the Inter-Departmental Committee justify belief in an immediate and severe trade depression;    on the contrary they are arguments against that belief.      But the arguments do indicate the possibility of serious difficulties not very far ahead and the probable interval is not more than sufficient for developing plans.3. What remedies are available for a period of pro-longed depression in the building and allied industries? Ad hoc public works schemes have been tried before with disappointing results:    they entail great expense and when the money is spent there is little to show for it.      It appears more reasonable to give special attention to the spacing out of those capital works which the 3t:;te can control or influence and which are neither concerned with house building nor with rearmament.      Such works
include the Government&apos;s own normal programme of building offices, museums etc.,  telephone development,  road development,  and the not inconsiderable building programmes of local authorities in connection with health and education services.4. I venture to ask for a decision on the broad issues of policy along the following lines.(a) Schemes where the initiative for recommending expenditure rests with local authorities.        -I understand from the Minister of Health that hispredecessors have more than once called the attention oflocal authorities to the desirability of looking beyondthe immediate future and budgeting over five yearly periods.Such a procedure has obvious advantages as an inducement tocareful finance and has been recommended on that ground.I understand that the Minister is prepared to issue a circular referring to this advice and inviting localauthorities to go a step further and to make a five-year programme of capital works,  arranging them in a roughorder of priority.      The letter would point out that byaccelerating or postponing the execution of the programmeadvantage could be taken of favourable financial conditions and that the procedure would assist the national economy byexercising a steadying influence on the demands on thebuilding and allied industries.      It would be necessary to add some technical advice on the subject of the alterations of the policy (e.g.  in the matter of land purchase) whichwould be required to enable the council to put anyparticular proposal into immediate execution when the favourable moment arrived.      The Minister would refer inthe circular to the fact that the initiation of a policyof this kind is particularly desirable at a time when theresources of the building industry are fully occupied butbeyond that to give no definite indication that theGovernment are either postponing their own works or calling-5-
upon local authorities to do so.      The letter would-request the authorities to submit their programmes to the Minister, not for approval but for information.      The programmes would cover all the activities of local authorities,  includ-ing the construction of roads and the building of schools.It would be necessary to consider the terras of the draft circular with care and to bear in mind the necessity of special exceptions in certain cases e.g.   (i)  in respect of A. R.J?o precautions,  and (ii) in depressed areas.(b) Schemes where the initiative for recommending expenditure rests with Government Departments.I should propose to adopt the recommendations of theInter-Departmental Committee in ^91 of Po-C. S.  (37)10.Broadly speaking the policy involved consists in (a)the postponement of capital works which can be delayed without serious prejudice to the public service,  (b) immediate consideration for the preparation of additional schemes andas those schemes are approved the taking of the necessary preliminary steps such as the acquisition of sites and thecompletion of plans to bring the schemes to a point at which work on them could be quickly started?(c) The appointment of a Committee on which each of the Departments responsible for a considerable programme of capital expenditure would be represe ited in order that co-operation may be assured and the situation kept under continuous review (^93).(d) The question raised in       94-95 of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s report as to the possibility of obtaining statutory powers compulsOrily to acquire sites for civil purposes to be deferred until it is seen whether without such powers insuperable difficulties are likely to be met with in acquiring sites in good time.

INTERDEPARTMENTAL  COMMITTEE  ON PUBLIC  CAPITALEXPENDITURE.ON the 1st June, 1937, the Chancellor of the Exchequer appointed an Inter-departmental Committee to inquire into certain questions connected with the regulation of the flow of capital expenditure.2.   The Committee was constituted as follows : Sir Frederick Phillips, K.C.M.G., C.B., Under-Secretary, Treasury,. Chairman.Mr. A. Whitley, O.B.E., Finance Officer, Home Office. With  Mr. J. H. Burrell, Principal, Home Office.Mr. P. J. G. Rose, C.B., Assistant Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office.Mr. W. Leitch, C.B., Principal Assistant Secretary, Office of Works.Mr. J. C.

Debenham, Assistant Secretary, Economic Advisory Council, Secretary to the Committee.
REPORT.1. WE were appointed to inquire into the suggestions made by the Economic Advisory Council in their Report of the 19th February on Economic Policy and the Maintenance of Trade Activity, which raised the question how far it is desirable under present conditions to regulate capital expenditure so as to even out the fluctuations of trade activity between good years and bad.2. In this Report the Economic Advisory Council were concerned with the danger that the level of home investment activity might reach proportions which would render a subsequent decline inevitable. It is by no means easy, in the absence of adequate statistics, to measure the new investment undertaken annually in the country. But by the term investment industries is to be understood the industries which contribute to the manufacture of (a) works of building and con-struction and the other fixed assets of industry and (b) goods purchased by the public which are commonly regarded as capital assets. Thus the production of buildings, plant, machinery, ships, vehicles, electrical equipment and heavy iron and steel work generally is covered by the term investment industry, but not the production of boots, furniture, pottery or ordinary household goods, however durable they may be. A bad estimate being better than none at all, the value of the production of investment goods for the home market may be taken as very roughly  800 million in the year 1936, including therein the expenditure of the defence services on the products of the engineering and building industries. But this is a gross estimate, i.e., a very substantial part of it represents the replacement and repair of goods as they grow old. In Appendix I, we have attempted to estimate what part of this expenditure can be said to be in any sense controlled by the State, and our conclusion is that the figure did not greatly exceed  250 million.3. The Economic Advisory Council in the report mentioned pointed out that, even in 1934, the output of the investment industries was probably in excess of their output in 1929. This increase was entirely due to a great expansion in housebuilding, which continued at a high level in 1935 and 1936, though there are now indications that some falling off would seem to be at hand apart from the demand arising from the re-armament programme. Direct re-armament expen-diture is not in the same category as other purchases of investment goods; but expenditure on industrial equipment, whether induced by the expansion of consumers&apos; demands or by the new demand arising from the re-armament expen-diture, is exposed, though in a lesser degree, to the same risk which arises in connection with housebuilding, viz., that in time a point of saturation will be reached.4. The Council were of the opinion that investment in industrial plant to-day is on a materially greater scale than in 1929. Although they could not say with certainty that in every instance the present level of investment would not be main-tained, there are indications that even to-day the productive capacity of industry is being expanded to a point at which difficulty may be found in utilising the existing equipment except in the quite abnormal conditions of demand which we are now experiencing. In general the Council felt justified in assuming that the present industrial demand for the products of the investment industries is of a character which exposes it to the risk of a setback even though consumers&apos; demand for the products of industry is maintained and of a substantial reduction in the event of any falling off in that demand.5. The consequences which the Council apprehended from the falling off in demand for the products of the investment industries were, first, a reduction of the level of incomes currently earned, and, second, the appearance of a surplus of labour and productive resources in the investment industries which could only be absorbed with difficulty into other industries. These consequences could most satisfactorily be avoided by arranging, if it were possible, that the flow of demand for products of the investment industries should be as regular as possible from one year to the next.6. The Councilrecommended that the Government should take what steps are possible to postpone work on investment projects which are not of an urgent[15717] b 2
character except in areas where unemployment still remains exceptionally high. The reserve of investment projects likely to become available through a policy of postponement during what remains of the natural life of the present recovery was not likely to be great enough to bridge the gap in investment activity which must be expected to occur in the next period of depression. The Council recommended, therefore, that the same public authorities who were to be urged under their first recommendation to reduce their capital expenditure to-day should be encouraged to prepare plans for a considerable expansion of their capital expenditure to become fully effective when the need arose.7. These recommendations in favour of the maintenance of stability in the field of investment are in accord with what has now become a common theory among economists. It may be well to set out shortly the general difficulties which might be expected were the Government to adopt the line of policy recommended.8. Nothing at first sight can appear more reasonable and convincing than the argument that the Government, so far as it controls capital expenditure, should so govern its own activities as to reduce its demands for labour and materials during a period of considerable prosperity with a view to increasing those demands when trade depression has set in. Nevertheless, practical difficulties of many kinds have been experienced in the past whenever the endeavour has been made to increase capital expenditure in a slump, and some of the practical difficulties are never likely to find any entirely satisfactory solution.9. In the first place the execution of any large works programme during a period of depression, whatever its value from an employment point of view, is likely to run counter to a strong public sentiment in favour of economy, and of a reduction in public commitments. In the circumstances in which it is contemplated that the slump may occur, namely, towards the completion of the rearmament programme, the position of the national budget is likely to be most unsatisfactory, and the total of the national debt and of the indebtedness of local authorities may also appear excessive to the public. The public will naturally resist strongly any proposals likely to give rise to increased taxation at such a time. Moreover, any programme which forced the Government to borrow repeatedly in the market might give rise to serious apprehensions as to the state of the national finances. This, in turn, would very greatly diminish the effectiveness of possible interven-tion by the Government and the Bank in the monetary sphere designed to produce that lowering of the rate of interest which must always remain the principal weapon in the hands of the authorities during times of trade depression. For these reasons it would be impossible for the Government to resist a real demand for economy if it arose, and the abandonment of a works programme in the course of a depression would retard, to some extent, the process of recovery. If it were now decided to rely principally on a works programme to combat a possible depression tJhe Government would, in effect, be gambling on the chance that a demand for economy would not arise, whereas the previous experience of this and other countries points strongly to the opposite conclusion. This must not, however, be taken to mean that the Committee are of opinion that nothing can be done to anticipate a possible depression. On the contrary, as the later part of the Report indicates, they are of opinion that a moderate and carefully considered scheme of necessary works might, if postponed now and planned to begin at a later date, have a definite value.10. Secondly, it is quite impracticable to foresee in advance at what future date a depression may be expected or to measure the extent of such a depression. The hypothesis adopted, for example, by the sub-committee of economists who were asked in 1935 to advise on the future level of unemployment was that a setback in trade would occur some time between 1936 and 1938. This hypothesis already appears highly improbable in the light of subsequent developments. It is to be observed that the general conception of a carefully prepared plan of works which could be put into immediate operation on the occurrence of an emergency will never in practice be at all closely realised. Preparation in advance is, in many cases, an extremely difficult technical operation, and the experience of competent Government Departments is that when- it is sought to put a scheme previously prepared into operation, such extensive modifications may be called for that almost as much delay is inevitable before the work is put into execution as in the case of a completely new scheme.  Unless thei&apos;e is a reasonable degree of certainty that
a planned programme would reach such a state of preparation as to be capable of being launched promptly, when the need arose on the building market, it would be dangerous to base great hopes upon the remedy.11. Moreover, the extent of the next depression is incalculable. Leading advocates of a strong public works policy have sometimes written or spoken in terms which suggest that a depression worse than that of 1929 to 1931 will shortly be upon this country. But the one thing which is reasonably certain is that in its-circumstances and extent the next depression will be quite different from the last. The particular misfortune which attended this country at that time was largely due to the fact that the trades and the districts which felt the worst impact of the depression, namely, those which specialised in production for the export market, were precisely those which at no period in the previous seven years had -experienced any real prosperity. Moreover, the last slump was largely attributable to monetary causes, and in particular to the sudden and enormous absorption of gold by Trance following the stabilisation of the franc at too low a level, during the period from 1927 onwards. This drain was specially felt in this country, for the reason that our resources were abnormally low. It is hardly necessary to remark that these resources are now ample, and that, so far as one can see, conditions will remain those of a plethora of gold supplies for many years to come. Monetary troubles of the same nature as those which played a prominent part in producing the last great depression are extremely unlikely to recur in the near future.12. Thirdly, delay in the execution of necessary capital works must interfere with the orderly development of the Government&apos;s policy in a number of fields, notably housing, education and the health services, generally. For without this capital expenditure it may be impossible to give effect to the improvements in the standards aimed at in these services. Moreover, postponement is likely to excite a certain degree of suspicion on the part of local authorities that the projects affected are in effect to be abandoned for good. The force of this consideration, however, is weakened if it is realised that some delay is quite inevitable in existing circumstances of shortage of materials and labour. If delay is inevitable, it is prudent to consider at an early date where such delays are likely to cause least harm.13. Fourthly, the argument that it is at any time desirable to restrict employ -ment of labour supposing a reserve of unemployment labour to exist is one which is very difficult to accept. Why should men be refused employment now merely on the ground or supposition that at some unknown future date more suitable employment of a character which cannot be foretold may possibly be provided for them? On the other hand, it must be remembered that, as stated above, at the present time there is a definite and ascertained shortage in the skilled occupations in the building and engineering trades, and a similar shortage is to be apprehended at an early date in the shipbuilding trade. These shortages have been intensified by the super-imposition of the Governments re-armament policy on a period of rapidly improving trade. The question of postponement of work, to meet the difficulties created by shortage of labour have been considered else-where, and the recommendations which have already been made on this point are: referred to below (see paragraph 21, Programme of the Office of Works). It may, therefore, happen that postponement of work which is desirable with a view to countering a possible depression can be fully justified at the moment in view of the urgent demands on certain classes of labour made by the Government&apos;s re-armament policy.14. Finally, it is to be observed that the field over which the recommended policy could in any case be applied is not extensive, for, though the Government has an important interest in projects of capital investment, yet by far the greater part of capital investment is not ordinarily subject to Government control. Thus the proportion of capital investment which can be expanded or contracted on the decisions of the Government is not very great unless the Government takes measures to exercise a strict control over private activities. Any system of control of private activities Avould be very difficult to establish, and would probably be found even more difficult to withdraw. Essentially the problem during a slump is to secure that there is an adequate supply of capital works to use up the current supply of savings in the country.   If capital investment projects have
been made difficult or dilatory as a result of Government control, the object of securing the free flow of savings into such projects is defeated and savings are more likely to accumulate in the form of idle bank deposits or possibly to seek more remunerative outlet in the form of investment in foreign securities.15. These objections, which are formidable, do not in our view indicate that nothing can be done, but indicate rather that the problem should be approached in the light of the following considerations : (a) It is essential that the Governments re-armament programme should becarried through as speedily as practicable; and in consequence the difficulties occasioned by shortage of labour and of steel supplies may in themselves call for postponement of less urgent work.(b) It may well be possible so to adjust this; postponement that it serves the double purpose of assisting re-armament, and also of alleviating a possible depression.(c) While it is agreed that it is impossible to anticipate the date or extent ofthe next depression, it is certain that whenever it occurs the provision of a considerable amount of employment on work of real importance, which has been postponed on a definite plan, will be of real value.(d) The nature of the work which can and should be postponed is examined in detail below. It is limited to works either under control or capable of influence by the Government, for the reason that interference with private enterprise may have incalculable and, indeed, disastrous results. It is by no means certain that the restriction even of luxury buildings or the rationing of steel for this or any similar purposes might not have unanticipated consequences, both in creating unemploy-ment and in seriously checking the existing wave of prosperity.(e) If the works dealt with below are to be of value at the moment when theyare most required, it will be essential that active preparations should be instituted at once, so that tenders may be issued at the appropriate moment, and that thus there may be avoided a delay of months or even years when the depression is actually in being. (/) We shall recommend later that a continuous watch should be kept over the problem, because it is essentially one which will alter from time to-time, and for this purpose we make a recommendation as to the machinery which may be necessary.16. In order to ascertain the field over which a policy of postponement might usefully operate it is necessary first to consider the present activities and plans of the principal Government Departments concerned, viz., (1) the Defence Depart-ments, (2) the Office of Works, (3) the Post Office, (4) the Ministry of Health, (5) the Board of Education, (6) the Ministry of Transport, (7) the Scottish Depart-ments, and (8) other Departments. In the course of such a survey the activities of local authorities and public utility societies, so far as these activities are-subject to some measure of control by the Government, will have been covered. The activities of individuals and private businesses will need consideration separately..(1) The Defence Departments.17. Expenditure under the heading of rearmament must naturally be excluded from the scope of the proposed policy. We would point out, however, that a not inappreciable part of the building expenditure included in the estimates of the Service.Departments does not contribute directly to the problem of defence. It consists, for instance, of expenditure on the improvement of old and the construe-tion of new barracks, and the provision of churches, schools, &amp;c. We do not doubt that by any reasonable standards this expenditure is necessary and its postpone-ment would naturally be resisted strongly by the Service Departments. Never -theless, we feel that such work is of a different degree of urgency from the rest of the rearmament programme, and that if a general slowing down of the less urgent branches of government capital expenditure is contemplated, it would be
-proper to review these items in the defence programme at the present time, with a view, not to their disappearance, but to their execution at a later date.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works.18. The civil building projects for which the Government is itself responsible are, with certain not very important exceptions, carried out by the Office of Works. They are normally financed out of revenue,1 so that their postponement would relieve and their intensification aggravate the budgetary position in the years in which they were undertaken. Building, on behalf of the Post Office, however, which is a substantial fraction of the whole, is an exception to this rule, being financed by borrowing under the Post Office and Telegraph (Money) Acts. The estimated civil works expenditure under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works on both capital and revenue account for the years 1937-39 is as follows  19. The building programmes for the current year under this head have been examined in detail, in consultation where necessary with the Departments for whom the schemes are provided, and it has been found possible to earmark a number of schemes, the provision of which can be delayed without serious prejudice to the public service. As specific provision for such schemes is in the initial year only of small dimensions, the reduction in the 1937 provision must be correspondingly small, namely  300,000, but if the period of suspension is extended over 1938 the reduction in the provision for that year will rise to  1,250,000 with pro tanto a fall in the demand on skilled building labour. The savings are primarily in respect of Post Offices (1937,  150,000, and 1938,  650,000), and Employment Exchanges (1937,  50,000, and 1938,  150,000).20. The 1938 building programme for civil constructional work is not yet available in so far as new projects are concerned, but it may well be that on21. The only remaining source of potential building schemes for a programme to be begun in 1940 or later is to be looked for in the development of new or the extension of existing Government policies. It is almost impossible at this stage to attempt to forecast expenditure under this head, but typical examples of what may be possible are as follows : Whitehall Building Scheme, South Kensington Site Development, Provincial Crown Building Schemes. Such an additional programme might involve in all an expenditure of the order of  5-10 millions.22. If a systematic attempt to formulate a programme of works to be launched in the building market in or about 1940 is thought desirable, it will be necessary for the Office of Works to be instructed to give the matter proper consideration at an early date, as the preliminaries incidental to the placing of building contracts inevitably occupy a period of two or three years, particularly when the acquisition of a site is involved.23. If this were done and funds were made available for the purchase of sites, their acquisition, which is inevitably a lengthy process, would present no more difficulty than is normally encountered, but if the period between the decision to proceed with a programme of works and its commencement were less than two or three years, the object would be, to some extent, frustrated, unless the Office of Works were endowed with compulsory powers of site acquisition.1937. 2,744,0001938. 4,488,0001939. 5,501,000(3) The Post Office.24.

The Treasury has not yet agreed to these figures.26. It will be observed that a very considerable increase in capital expenditure on telephone equipment is anticipated in the current year. This follows upon an increase in the year 1936 over expenditure in 1935. For the most part the increase in expenditure is the consequence of an expansion of demand due to-the present prosperity and the reduction of charges in the year 1936. The proposed expenditure for the year 1937-38, however, includes provision for a further expansion of demand anticipated to follow from a reduction in tariffs, chiefly affecting the shorter distance ranges, which the Post Office hope to be in a position to make probably in the Autumn of 1938. An earlier reduction of tariffs would be, in the view of the Post Office, inadvisable, not on financial grounds, but because the equipment necessary to deal with the increase in demand could not be available earlier, having regard to the pressure under which the supplying industries are already working.27. The possibility of diminishing-the proposed capital expenditure of the Post Office is bound up with the question of deferring the concessions in respect of .telephone charges referred to, which might enable some reduction to be effected. Otherwise, the extent to which economies in capital expenditure can be made, without prejudice to the efficiency of the service, is very limited.   Although the
growth in demand might be checked by an upward revision of charges, that is a remedy which might adversely affect the long period developments of the telephone service. Without embarking on those aspects of this subject which require technical qualifications which we do not possess, it seems to us that any revision of the Post Office engineering expenditure making for a reduction in the next two or three years and an increase thereafter would be very valuable, having regard to the substantial share of the output of the electrical industries which the Post Office demand represents, and to the fact that a subsequent increase in this expenditure will not throw any extra charge upon the budget.(4) The Ministry of Health.28. The Ministry of Health exercises a general control over the loan expenditure of all local authorities in England and Wales, with the exception of the London County Council. This control, which arises from the necessity under which all local authorities lie of obtaining sanction for all expenditure out of funds raised by loan, either from Parliament, or from one of the Government Departments, relates in the case of the Ministry of Health not only to expenditure in respect of services in which it is itself interested, e.g., Housing and the Health services generally, but also to expenditure in respect of certain of the services which are the concern of other government Departments, e.g., Education and Highways. In the latter cases the Ministry acts, in general, on the advice of the Department immediately concerned, though it may withhold sanction because of the general financial position of the local authority applying for it. The London County Council promotes an annual Money Bill in Parliament, under which it receives the powers it requires to borrow for its programme of capital expenditure, and other local authorities sometimes take power to borrow for particular projects by special Acts of Parliament.29. The loans sanctioned by the Ministry of Health have varied in value from nearly  80 millions in 1930-31 to under  40 millions in 1932-33. In the year 1936-37 they amounted to  81 millions. About 40 per cent, of these loans are in respect of the housing activities of local authorities. Of the remainder a substantial proportion are in respect of education services, and roads, bridges and street improvements. In these cases the Ministry of Health acts on the advice of the Board of Education and the Ministry of Transport. For the rest the loans relate first to the ordinary activities of local authorities (the most important services from the point of view of loans raised are sewerage and sewage disposal, public walks and pleasure grounds, mental hospitals, hospitals and ambulances, town halls and offices, poor law purposes, and baths and wash houses) and secondly to their trading undertakings, of which the most important are water-works and gasworks. Expenditure on electricity undertakings is not sanctioned by the Ministry of Health. The powers of the Ministry of Health in respect of sanctions are considerable, for they are under no statutory obligation to grant sanction. In practice of course uniformity of treatment between different authorities is necessary, and the Ministry normally only withholds sanction if (a) the cost of the project is out of relation with the purpose aimed at, or (6) if the financial position of the local authority is such as to make borrowing undesirable.30. The following table gives the amount of loans sanctioned by the Ministry of Health for the years 1930-31, 1935-36 and 1936-37. The year 1930-31 is given as the peak year before 1936-37. The figures are exclusive of loans sanctioned by the Ministry of Health for services which fall within the programmes of the Board of Education and the Ministry of Transport.[15717]c

Housing.31. Of the expenditure under the heading of housing  6-3 millions in 1935-36 and  4-8 millions in 1936-37 was in respect of expenditure under the Small Dwellings&apos; Acquisition Acts, i.e., was money advanced to purchasers of dwellings, and therefore did not necessarily represent new money for the purpose of house-building. The remainder is, for the most part, in respect of the slum clearance programmes and the programme in regard to overcrowding. These programmes are constantly under review. The present estimate of the total number of houses required under the slum clearance scheme is 400,000. Of these 150,000 have already been provided, and 250,000 remain to be provided. It has been estimated that according to the present definition about 340,000 houses are overcrowded, and that 200,000 new houses would be required to provide the additional accommoda-tion required. A further 500,000 houses Avould be brought within the scope of the Act by a comparatively small change in the definition of overcrowding. This might lead to a building of a further 200,000 houses. Thus there are at present 450,000 houses to be built by local authorities and this might be increased to 650,000 by a change in the definition of overcrowding.32. At present local authority houses are being built at the rate of 60,000 a year, and if this rate is continued about 250,000 houses would remain to be built at the end of 1940, or 450,000 if the definition of overcrowding is changed. There would be considerable political difficulty in slowing down of local authority building below its present rate; but it should not be impracticable to prevent it increasing for the present. Later on it would probably be possible, if and Avhen required, to expand the output of local authorities&apos; houses to 100,000 a year without undue difficulty, provided that adequate financial assistance is forthcoming. Taking the average cost of a house at  350 the present annual capital expenditure on the basis of 60,000 houses is  21,000,000, and this would rise to  35,000,000 if 100,000 houses a year were built.
Sewerage and Sewage Disposal.33. Some part of this expenditure comes under the heading of urgent health services, and cannot be postponed. It is, moreover, dependent to some extent on the increase in building estates, and it might be difficult to maintain if there was a serious falling off in house building. Schemes for sewage disposal might in some cases be postponed.Public Walks and Pleasure Grounds.34. A large part of the expenditure under this heading is in respect of the purchase of land, but the loan sanctions are considerable,  3,196,000 in 1936-37, and in so far as this expenditure provides employment for labour, the question of its postponement might be worth investigation.Mental Hospitals.35. Expenditure under this heading has been increasing in recent years. It has been influenced by the passing of the Mental Treatment Act of 1930. Considerable expenditure still remains to be incurred under this act, but the work is of an institutional character and capable of being spread over.Waterworks.36. Fairly heavy expenditure on waterworks has been undertaken in the last few years, largely as a consequence of the difficulties experienced in recent droughts. This expenditure has now probably reached its peak and may be expected to decline in a few years&apos; time.37. As the control of the Ministry of Health over the capital expenditure of local authorities is by no means complete, it will be necessary to rely largely on the initiative of local authorities themselves. The procedure to be adopted would naturally follow previous precedents as far as possible, though hitherto the Ministry has generally only intervened to secure a reduction of loan expenditure on financial grounds. In 1931, the most recent instance, the Government issued a circular to local authorities calling for a downward revision of all loan expendi-ture, and followed up this appeal by administrative action in the granting of loan sanction. On that occasion the force of the Governments appeal was the stronger because on the whole it reflected the policy which local authorities them-selves were anxious to pursue. To-day, however, it is likely that the change in policy to be recommended to local authorities would not coincide with their own wishes. The financial position of local authorities is generally satisfactory, and they are anxious to exploit the opportunity afforded by the present low rates of interest to develop those services which call for heavy capital expenditure. We believe, however, that the co-operation of local authorities would be more readily secured if the suggestion for a reduction in expenditure to-day was coupled with an encouragement to prepare plans for an increase in expenditure as the develop-ment of the general industrial situation made this desirable. Local authorities should, we suggest, be invited to follow the following procedure : first, to deter-mine what were likely to be the projects for which they would require loan sanction in the course of, say, the next six years; secondly, to set these projects in an order of priority, and thirdly, to proceed as far as possible in the pre-liminary work of acquiring sites and preparing plans. It should then be suggested to them that while the situation remains as it is they should only apply for sanction in the case of those projects for which the need was urgent, and they should be given to understand that the willingness of the Ministry of Health to grant sanction would depend on the general development of the economic situation, and that it would increase, subject always to overriding financial con-siderations, if and when the present pressure on the capacity of the building industries showed signs of diminishing. It would then be for the Ministry of Health, and the other sanctioning departments, to give effect to this policy by administrative action. We attach as an appendix to this report a draft circular which the Ministry of Health might issue in this connexion to local authorities in England and Wales.38. Even if it is assumed that the response of. local authorities to such an appeal by the Government is immediate the actual expenditure of local authori-ties would for some time continue to be under the influence of past loan sanctions. [15717] c 2
It would be at least six months before the change in policy was apparent, and at least a year before it was fully effective. It is not impossible that almost as soon as the policy becomes effective the falling off in private house building may introduce a changed atmosphere, and this is one of the reasons for which we suggest that the situation must be continuously watched. The building pro-gramme for rearmament is scheduled to be completed in 1940, and even if we assume that, with the inevitable delays, it is not completed until 1941, it is likely, if, as seems possible, there is now a progressive falling off in private house building, that the maximum pressure upon the building industry will come in 1940 or before rather than after that year. In that event the longest period in which the policy could now be operative would be for two years, and any delay in putting the policy into effect would seriously detract from its usefulness.39. As an indication of the degree of curtailment in local authority programmes which might be expected, if there were a whole-hearted response to the Govern-ment&apos;s circular we reproduce the following figures of loans sanctioned since April 1930. It will be recalled that the circular to local authorities at the time of the financial crisis was issued in October 1931. The figures given for housing loans are exclusive of loans for Small Dwellings&apos; Acquisition, and are, therefore, smaller than those given in the previous table : Amounts of loans sanctioned by the Ministry of Health in the first and second half periods of the under-mentioned financial years.Financial		First Half	Second.

Loan expenditure by local authorities for educational purposes requires to be approved by the Board of Education, and the Board makes a grant in respect of the loan charges on such expenditure. The programme of loan expenditure by local authorities anticipated for the next few years is exceptionally heavy.41. Loan sanctions approved by the Board in recent years have been as follows :  Year.1935-36......1936-37 ......1937-38 (Estimated) 9,499,906 11,000,109 14,500,000
42. Expenditure in the year 1936-37 and the estimated expenditure in 1937-38 was divided among the different divisions of the educational programme as follows:  1936-37. 1937-38.Secondary Education Elementary Education Technical EducationMedical    ......Training Colleges(estimated).   2,231,305 2,400,0006,826,827 8,900,0001,645,139 2,600,000253,950 500,00042,888 100,00011,000,109        14,500,00043. It will be observed that elementary education is responsible for the greater part of the capital expenditure incurred in 1936 and contemplated for the current year.     The main classes of expenditure under this head were as follows in , 1935-36 and 1936-37 :-Capital Expenditure on Elementary Education, 1935-36 and 1936-37. 000.1935-36. 1936-37.To meet housing developments, openingof new lines and growth of popu-lation for other reasons To  replace or  relieve  condemned un-satisfactory or temporary premises To   relieve   overcrowding   in   existingschoolsTo secure economy by re-organisation ... To provide advanced instruction To provide sites and playing fields2,380	2,773964	815277	201643	1,52675	85766	1,0755,105	6,47544. The present time is one of exceptionally heavy capital expenditure on the part of educational authorities because the Hadow re-organisation is in full swing, and because the Education Act of 1936 allows local authorities to make grants in certain circumstances for the enlargement of non-provided schools up to a maximum of three-fourths of the capital required for that purpose. Ex-penditure under these two heads has been further stimulated by a temporary increase in the rate of grant which in the case of expenditure incurred in the years 1936 to 1940 inclusive is to be at the rate of 50 per cent, instead of 20 per cent. Another factor making for increased capital expenditure is the Govern-menfs policy of stimulating technical education.45. The Board of Education have prepared a rough estimate of the capital expenditure which they will wish to sanction in the three years 1937 to 1939. This is as follows :   Secondary Education       ...      ...       ...      ...      5,000,000Elementary Education      ......      ......    25,000,000Technical &quot;Education        ............      9,400,000Medical       ..................      2,200,000Training Colleges   ...............        400,000Add  for  Wales   (secondary,  elementary   andtechnical education)    .............      3,000,000Total     ............      ...    45,000,00046. Expenditure at the rate of  15 millions a year is substantially in excess of that m any previous period. Moreover, this period of heavy expenditure is timed to coincide with the period of heavy expenditure under the re-armament pro-gramme, and thus conflicts with the objects aimed at by the Committee If the requirements for elementary education must be met in view of statutory obli-gations, we can only suggest that further consideration should be given to slowing down other items in the programme ?
J    . (6) Ministry of Transport.47. The public expenditure with which the Ministry of Transport is con--cerned falls under the following headings : (A) Roads and bridges.(B) Railways schemes financed under Treasury guarantee.(C) Electricity.(D) Tramways, trolley vehicles and omnibuses (by sanctioning loans for localauthorities).(E) Docks (by sanctioning loans or fixing repayment periods in certain cases). 48.

It accounts for about  8^ millions out of Road Fund expenditure of  20 millions (1937-38).49. Expenditure on improvements and new construction falls in the main into the following groups : (i) The Five Years&apos; Programme, (ii) Long-term Schemes, (iii) Trunk Roads.(i) The Five Years&apos; Programme.50. In a circular letter to highway authorities issued in February 1935 the Minister announced that the Government had decided to make provision for assistance from the Road Fund towards the cost of approved schemes which the authorities were prepared to undertake during the ensuing five years and invited the submission of programmes of improvement works. Programmes have accord-ingly been submitted of works to a total estimated cost of  128 millions, towards which contributions from the Road Fund are expected to amount to approximately  76 millions. Commitments in respect of approved schemes under this head so far amount to  67 millions, of which the Road Fund proportion is estimated at  40 millions. Thus about half of the programmes submitted have been approved to date. It is expected that further schemes will be approved during the course of this year involving expenditure of about  20 millions (Road Fund share  12 millions) and the balance,  41 millions, of the programmes in the course of the next two or three years. Up to the end of March 1937 about  10 millions of the programme (Road Fund share  6 millions) had been liquidated and expenditure of a further  10 millions is expected this year. Thereafter the rates of expen-diture would, in the normal course, rise so as to enable the balance of present com-commitments to be liquidated in three to four years. Broadly, it may be 1940 before the whole programme is approved and four years after that before it is completed. It would be possible to slow down the rate of expenditure to some extent without openly urging local authorities to do so, but if any drastic postponement were required an announcement of policy would be necessary. Thus it may be estimated
that by the end of 1940 about half the programme would be completed-leaving some  60 millions (Road Fund share  36 millions) of works still to be done.t(ii) Long-term Schemes.51. These include a number of very expensive schemes the execution of which will be spread over a period of years. Existing commitments under this head amount to  9f millions (Road Fund share  6J millions). All these schemes are in or near London and some are already in progress. They include the Dartford-Purfleet Tunnel ( 3-^ millions), for which the Ministry of Transport provides current finance, and schemes, e.g., Cromwell Road extension, the bulk of the cost of which is for land or property. The estimated spread of the work is from 5 to 6 years from the present. Only  400,000 is estimated to be spent from the Road Fund on these works during the current year.52. In addition, Treasury authority has been sought for an offer to the London County Council and the City Corporation of assistance to a further group of large London improvements recommended in an interim report by Sir Charles Bressey as a result of his London Highway Development Survey and provisionally estimated to cost  35 millions. On a broad estimate of a 60 per cent, grant, the charge on the Road Fund would be  21 millions. These works would be carried out in sections and spread over at least ten years. Here also the acquisition of property represents a large element of the cost, and it is important in the interests of economy that the necessary acquisitions should proceed as opportunity occurs ; moreover, if property is not acquired in advance the works will not proceed when required. The actual expenditure capable of giving employment would be, of course, very much less, in relation to the capital expenditure involved, than in the case of works in the open country, though it must be remembered that preliminary demolition and ultimate rebuilding on a large scaie would, in most cases, be involved.53. Charing Cross Bridge. A bridge at Charing Cross has been recommended by the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee. The London County Council have estimated that the cost of a bridge, including complementary road improvements, would be  32^- millions, but this estimate is not accepted by the Ministry. This scheme would also take at least 10 years, and more probably 15 years, to complete, and it is open to the same consideration as schemes referred to in paragraph 52 above, that a large part of the cost is due to the acquisition of property for approach roads and development of the surrounding area and is, therefore, relatively of little immediate value from the point of view of employment.54. Severn, Forth and Humber Bridges. These large schemes for bridging estuaries command substantial support locally but are not yet the subject of commitment of national funds.  They are estimated to cost respectively :   millions.-.       Severn   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 2\Humber ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 2fForth    ................... 455. All the schemes in paragraphs 52, 53 and 54 Avould need Parliamentary powers.56. The London schemes, except for the tunnels and bridges, are expensive mainly because of the cost of property, and, for the same reason, the time they take both to plan and to execute is so long as to make it almost impossible to relate the period of their execution to any specified years. They are rather schemes to be worked at steadily year by year. No settled&apos; scheme is yet in sight for Charing Cross Bridge.57. Of the three major bridge schemes the Severn Bridge was accepted by the Government, but the necessary Bill was rejected by Parliament in 1936. The Humber Bridge was accepted in principle in 1931 and a Bill was promoted by the Hull Corporation. The Bill was strongly opposed by navigational and other interests, and in Committee clauses were added imposing substantial^ contingent liabilities on the promoters.  The Bill was postponed after the crisis of 1931 and
was withdrawn by the promoters in 1933. The scheme now proposed is much more expensive than the 1931 scheme owing to the efforts made to overcome the objections to the latter. The Forth Bridge scheme has not hitherto been approved by the Government and has not been before Parliament. The Governments attitude to fhe three schemes was fully considered in November 1936 when, in response to a question in Parliament, the Minister of Transport stated that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have examined the case presented for new bridges over the estuaries of the Forth, the Severn, and the Humber. They have felt bound to have primary regard to the overriding importance of the National Defence programme and the demands which that programme will progressively make upon the national resources. His Majesty&apos;s Government have come to the conclusion that they would not be justified in embarking upon the execution of these public works at the present moment, but this decision does not exclude the reconsideration of these projects at a later date.&quot;(iii) Trunk Roads.. 58. Some 4,500 miles of main traffic arteries, termed trunk roads, were taken over by the Minister on the 1st April, 1937, and their maintenance and improve-ment is now a direct charge on national funds. The Cabinet were informed by the Minister in June 1936 that a programme was necessary of improvements to trunk roads of an estimated cost of  70 millions, to be spread over not less than 10 years. Schemes already in hand total  5 millions, and a priority list of works to be started immediately will provide for expenditure of  8-^ millions. Completion of this  13^ millions worth of work will probably be spread over 3 to 4 years, and the current year&apos;s Estimate provides  2^ millions for this purpose. We understand that the maximum annual expenditure is likely to be in the region of  5 millions. The Ministry estimate that expenditure on capital works on trunk roads is unlikely to exceed  10- 12 millions by the end of 1940, so that a planned programme of about  55- 60 millions would remain at that date.rGeneral conchisions Roads.59. (a) Apart from any definite retarding of work, it is unlikely that more than half the Five Years&apos; Programme will be finished by the end of 1940. The schemes started late and are expanding slowly. Many highway authorities would probably be not unwilling to slow up work, especially if prices rise, a consideration particularly applicable to bridge schemes.(&amp;) Long-term schemes involve long planning in advance, including the -obtaining of Parliamentary powers. They therefore mature slowly, and an examination of the Ministry of Transports proposals under this head leads us tO&apos; the conclusion that, apart from a few schemes already under way, nothing substantial will be done before 1940 in any case. No deliberate slowing up appears therefore to be advisable, and if these schemes are to be undertaken and work begun on them in 3 or 4 years&apos; time, it will be necessary to begin preliminary steps soon. Highway authorities will generally do little in the way of detailed planning until a grant has been promised. After a grant has been promised they must obtain Parliamentary powers and acquire property and then only can work begin.(c) Of a programme of trunk road improvements of  70 millions planned for at least ten years, not more than  10-12 millions is likely to be spent before the end of 1940.60. We recommend (a) that those items, in the road programme where there is-not an element of great urgency and which, as in the case of bridge construction, involve substantial demands on industries or classes of skilled labour where supply is deficient should not be started while the present shortage of such materials and labour continues, and (b) that preliminary steps should now be taken, e.g.. the acquisition of land, which will facilitate the quick expansion of work on road building when the need arises.61. There remains the question whether there should be a more general slowing-down of the present programmes of road construction with a view to accumulating a considerable programme of work which can be rapidly undertaken when the need arises. As regards road works generally, it will be appreciated that the difficulties which exist as regards labour and materials in connection with the building and engineering industries do not exist, or at least do not exist in the
same degree, in connection with road work. A substantial part of the expenditure involved, especially in the towns, where congestion and safety considerations are most pressing, is required for acquisition of property, and the labour employed, except on bridge schemes, is, in the main, unskilled. There thus appears to be no object in postponement in the interests of the rearmament programme. Nor does it appear that postponement beyond the dates when the works will in normal course be carried out is necessary to secure a reservoir of schemes against a future depression. All the indications point to there being for many years to come an ample supply of desirable road works to absorb such financial resources as are likely to be available, whether from national or from local sources. A policy of postponement of highway expenditure would undoubtedly evoke disappoint-ment and criticism both on grounds of convenience and of public safety. It would be likely to exercise a discouraging effect upon local authorities, who are only now expanding their organisations to meet the promise of development over a term of years announced by the Government after the severe fluctuations of policy during the preceding five or six years, including the cancellation of grant commitments in 1931. Nor should the hampering effects of failure to develop facilities for communications upon rehousing and measures for defence be overlooked. Taking all these considerations into account, some of us consider that no general post-ponement of the execution of the road programmes already planned is desirable.62. It may be urged, on tihe other hand, that if such services as house building are contracted now to provide a programme of work later, there is no fair ground for the claim that any acceleration of work on the roads which may be put in hand during a period of bad employment must be a clear addition over and above a full normal programme to be carried out alike in good years and bad. The country has no unlimited resources available to defray the expense, and, if it had, there is no compelling reason for applying those resources to road work. It is true that there is at present a surplus of unskilled labour, but it does not follow that the road programme attracts unskilled labour which would otherwise find no employment at all. During the depression large numbers of skilled and semi-skilled workers who could not find work in their own trades drifted into unskilled occupations, and this may be expected to happen again if there is another depression. It is essential that, as a corrective of this process, in times of good trade every encouragement should be offered to unskilled workers to find employment in situations where they may be expected to acquire or recover some degree of skill, or at any rate to find employment in less casual trades. The existence of a large demand for unskilled work such as is implied by a large programme of road work must tend to work in the opposite direction.63. For these reasons the majority of us think that it is not possible to except road work from the implications of the general programme we have outlined. Road work has been regarded in the past as work specially suitable to be under-taken in times of bad employment, and we do not think that local authorities or public opinion generally would accept the view that, while other social activities must be deferred in the national interest to provide later work for the unemployed, road building should be given special exemption. We think that road building-should be curtailed (apart from the case of bridges mentioned above) in those instances where the expenditure is likely to exert an immediate influence on the demand for labour. Road expenditure in towns is largely a question of payments for the acquisition of property, compensation to displaced owners and the like. There is no particular advantage in incurring such expenditure in times of depression. Road expenditure in rural areas, on the other hand, involves a relatively much greater demand for labour and materials. It is in schemes in rural areas that we believe that the most satisfactory opportunities for a policy of postponement are to be found.(B) Railways Works.64. Two programmes were the subject of agreements in 1935 under which the Treasury guaranteed the capital for specified works of railway development. In each case the works were to be completed within 5 years. The first agreement provided for works in the London area to be executed by the London Passenger Transport Board, the Great Western Railway and the London and North-Eastern Railway to the .value of  40 millions. The other provided for railway developments in the provinces to be undertaken by the four amalgamated railway companies to the total value of  29^ millions. A total of  66^ millions has been [15717] &apos; D
raised under the guarantees by Finance Corporations, the balance being found by the railway companies, and the companies and the London Passenger Transport Board have undertaken to borrow the sums raised and are responsible for interest charges from the date of raising and for ultimate repayment.Up to the end of 1936 expenditure of over  8 millions had been incurred and contracts had been let for  13f millions.65. In considering whether postponement of all or of any part of these programmes which has not yet been substantially commenced is advisable, we were faced with the following considerations : (a) The schemes under the London agreement constitute a balanced pro-gramme of profitable and of relatively unprofitable, but most urgent, works, such as tube extensions and electrification on the eastern side of London. The Transport Board and the Companies would doubtless be unwilling to postpone only the former, while the Government could hardly consent to postponement of the latter.(b) If the Government  urged  postponement,  the  Companies,  who  areresponsible for the interest on the money raised, might demand relief from their obligations, especially as the period of the loan, which is only for 15 years, cannot be extended.In view of these objections we are unable to recommend postponement of any of the London schemes, which constitute the greater part of the expenditure, nor do we think it advisable that the Government should take the initiative in urging the Companies to postpone the developments in the provinces.66. If the programmes were carried out according to the agreements, they would be completed by the end of 1940, but provisions were made enabling the Minister of Transport to allow a further period for completion of any of the items of work and we understand that he has, at the instance of the Great Western Railway Company, allowed an extension of four years, until the 1st January, 1945, for the completion of about  2 millions worth of the works to be executed by that Company. He has, however, stipulated in regard to certain of the postponed works that if at any time after the 1st July, 1939, he shall require the Company to commence them forthwith, they shall thereupon carry out and complete such works with all reasonable despatch. It is possible that a similar course may be followed in regard to certain other of the schemes in the railway programmes, but postponement does not appear likely to be practicable for more than some  5 or  6 millions worth out of the total of nearly  70 millions.(C) Electricity.67. Control over capital expenditure of the electricity generating and supply industries is confined to expenditure of public authorities and is exercised by means of the sanctioning of loans and the giving of consents to apply surplus revenue for capital purposes.68. The Electricity Commissioners are the authority for sanctioning the raising of loans for electricity purposes by public authorities, and during the last three years the totals of the loans sanctioned, excluding the Central Electricity Board, have been as follows :-  ^1934-35   ...      ............      18,238,7701935-36   ...............      17,186,9951936-37...............      24,148,151The average amount of each application is approximately  20,000, but in many cases the sums involved in individual applications run into six or occasionally even into seven figures. Of the amount sanctioned in 1936-37, approximately  7,500,000 was for expenditure on generation and the balance for purposes connected with distribution. There is at present no indication that local authority undertakers are deferring or restricting expenditure in view of the legislation proposed to implement the report of the Committee on Electricity Distribution. &apos; s     .69. The Central Electricity Board is authorised, subject to the consent of the Electricity Commissioners, to borrow up to  60 millions for the construction and acquisition of main transmission lines and purposes connected therewith and standardisation of frequency.   Up to the present, the Commissioners have
consented to borrowing by the Board of  52-1 millions, of which less than  2 millions remains unexercised.70. The Board is nearing the completion of its initial capital outlay on the construction of the Grid system, and its expenditure is unlikely to exceed  1 million to  1^ millions a year during the next few years. This expenditure will be largely of a co-ordinating character or for the purpose of affording new or improved supplies to large works, including the steel works at Corby and Ebbw Vale. Apart from its own expenditure, the Board can, with the approval of the Electricity Commissioners, direct authorised undertakers to carry out extensions and alterations to generating stations, and during 1936 the estimated amount of expenditure involved by such directions was  12^ millions, which will probably be spread over 2 to 3 years. Further directions have been issued during the present year and will continue to be issued as required to meet growth of demands.71. In the event of legislation providing for the reorganisation of the distributive side of the industry being passed next year, capital developments on a substantial scale may ultimately be anticipated. The immediate effect will, however, be more likely to restrict than to stimulate development pending the completion of amalgamation schemes, and we do not anticipate an increase in the rate of expenditure as a result of the reorganisation within the next 3 or 4 years.72. The availability of a cheap and abundant supply of electricity throughout the country which is being assisted through the developments represented by the capital expenditure now being incurred is one means of assisting rapid realisation of the rearmament programme and would be of substantial value to industry generally in the event of a future depression and a fall in prices. We do not therefore recommend that any steps should be taken to slow down the course of development in the electricity supply industry.(D) Tramways, Trolley Vehicles and Omnibus loan sanctions.73. The conversion of tramway services to trolley vehicle or omnibus services is proceeding steadily and local authorities must apply to the Ministry of Transport for sanction if they desire to borrow for the purchase of omnibuses, erection of garages, &amp;c. Applications are fairly numerous but are generally for compara-tively modest sums and for short periods. The loans sanctioned in 1936-37 amounted to  if millions. As conversion is normally profitable, local authorities would be likely to object to the suggestion that it should be postponed, more particularly as the alternative to scrapping the trams and purchasing trolley vehicles or omnibuses would often be heavy expenditure on reconstruction. Expenditure of this nature is revenue producing and much of it is of the nature of replacement of existing assets, the original cost of which has been repaid. Postponement would generally cause considerable inconvenience and would be uneconomic and we do not recommend it.(E) Docks, Harbours, Piers and Navigations.74. In a few cases, of which the Port of London is the most important, the Ministry of Transport exercises control either through sanctioning the raising of new capital or the use of sinking fund monies for capital purposes or by prescribing the period within which it shall be repaid.75. In March 1937 the General Manager of the Port of London stated that the Authority contemplate carrying out, as soon as financial considerations permit, schemes of modernisation involving a total expenditure of nearly  11,000,000, in addition to works on which they are actually engaged to the cost of  1,342,000.76. Dock developments are also understood to be contemplated at Liverpool, where the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board have in view the construction of a deep-water entrance lock, on the Clyde, where the Navigation Trustees have stated that they have in hand or under consideration various dock improvements estimated to cost in the region of  1^ millions, on the Tyne and at Sunderland, Maryport and Dumbarton. Some of these schemes are the subject of application for assistance from the Commissioners for the Special Areas, but, otherwise, the Government is not in a position to influence the dates or rates of expenditure, and [15717] d 2
the responsible authorities must be left to finance and execute their schemes as and when they think fit. It may be mentioned that the Railway Companies&apos; programme, to which reference has already been made, includes dock works at Grimsby and Hull of an estimated cost of over  800,000.76a. The following is a summary of capital expenditure with which the Ministry of Transport is concerned, at present planned or contemplated : Roads   &apos; s millions.Five years&apos; programme ...      ... ... ... ...      128Trunk roads         ... ...       ... ... ... ...        70Long-term schemes ....... ... ... ...        45243Charing Cross and other bridges      ...       ...       ...       ...        41Railways ...      ...      ...      ...      ... &apos;    ...      ...      ...        69*Port of London and other ports        ...       ...       ......        14*368Of this, the following may be outstanding at the end of 1940 : Roads   &apos;s millions.Five years&apos; programme ... ... ... ... ...        60Trunk roads ... ... ... ... ... ...        60Long-term schemes ... ... ... ... ...        40160Charing Cross and other bridges      ...       ...       ...       ...        41Railways ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... say    6Port of London and other docks       ...      ...      ...      ... say   12219 say 220Capital expenditure on a large scale by the Central Electricity Board may have ceased, but developments arising out of the proposed reorganisation of the distributive side of the electricity industry may then be becoming active. It is, however, necessary to enter a caveat to the effect that a time of diminishing industrial activity may not prove favourable to the expansion of power and transport.77. The Road Fund expenditure would fall directly on the budget under the new arrangements made last year. A large acceleration of work would therefore involve a proportionately large increase in the Vote for Roads. If the time when the works were undertaken were a time of budget stringency, the difficulty of providing the necessary funds might well militate against the execution of a large programme, even if the works were ready to hand.(7) Scottish Office.78. In the case of Government building schemes involving capital expenditure, e.g., the construction of new prisons, the position in Scotland with regard to possible postponement and the preparation of plans, &amp;c, of postponed schemes is substantially the same as in England and Wales. But in other respects the position in Scotland is fundamentally different. Whereas in the latter country it seems likely that the building industry is to-day seriously over-expanded in relation to its long-term prospects, in Scotland the -reverse is true. Owing especially to the very bad housing conditions now existing in Scotland (where working-class houses are mainly built by local authorities), there is a pressing need for an expansion of the building industry to cope with the demands which housing and other schemes will make upon it for many years to come, as well as to meet the needs of the Government and of industry.79. In these circumstances, the problem at present in Scotland is to secure that the available building labour (and any augmentation that can be secured by negotiations now in progress) and the available materials are utilised for
necessary and pressing schemes. If these are given priority in execution and allowance is made for the urgent needs of Government and industry, the remaining local authority schemes will automatically be postponed.80. The Scottish Office have issued a circular to local authorities requesting them to review their building programmes for a period of, say, two years, from this-angle, in co-operation, where necessary, with adjoining authorities who share a common pool of labour. The circular offers the assistance of Government Depart-ments in cases where, after the review, doubt exists as to the relative importance and urgency of the various parts of their building programmes. It is to be expected that this review of local authority building programmes will disclose a considerable number of schemes which have been planned, but which must be-postponed till 1940 or later. When the review is complete, the situation as-regards these and other future schemes can be examined again.81. The bulk of loan expenditure in Scotland does not require sanction by the Central Department, as local authorities have the power to raise loans for most purposes with the consent of a two-thirds majority of the Council. If special, measures for damping down of local authority schemes were needed, that method would not be available in Scotland. But for the reasons indicated above, the postponement of local authority building schemes will be automatically achieved in Scotland by the shortage of skilled building labour and materials.82. Figures for loans sanctioned are not available in the case of Scottish Local Authorities, but in the following table figures are given of the amount raised by loan in each of the four years ending the 31st March, 1934. It will be observed that housing expenditure accounts for a large and increasing share of the total: Statement showing for each of the financial years 1930-31 to 1933-34 the amount of Loans raised on Bond or Mortgage and Stock issued by Local Atithorities in Scotland.Name of Service.Loans Raised.	1930-31.	1931-32.	1932-33.	1933-34.Housing  Assisted Schemes	 	 	 	 	3,309,843	4,800,223	5,898,396	6,367,137Unassisted Schemes     ...       ...       ...	549,764	330,332	201,749	208,109Poor Law 				(1) Poorhouses, &amp;c.	22,217	9,674	44,643	35,804(2) Poor Relief   ...       .........

(8) Other Departments.83. The programmes under the control of other Government departments are-relatively small.  We may refer to the following : (a)   Home Office84. The Home Office have under consideration the improvement of prisons in England and Wales. The necessary work, however, can be carried out almost entirely by the use of prison and Borstal labour, the demands made on industry for materials being relatively small. A more extensive programme of prison recon-struction might be developed to meet the circumstances of a depression. Such a programme could not be entrusted to prison labour and would involve recourse to outside contractors.85. The Home Office is also responsible for the programme of works contemplated under the Air Raid Precaution scheme, including fire brigades and police buildings. The amounts involved under this scheme are not yet known, but they will be very considerable. Such expenditure, however, falls within the category of urgent defence expenditure and will therefore not be susceptible of postponement.(b) The Ministry of A griculture.86. The Ministry of Agriculture authorises loans raised by local authorities and Catchment Boards for the purpose of land drainage. The amounts so sanctioned have shown a tendency to increase and amounted in the year 1935-36 to  1-8 millions.87. Though substantial sums are involved in the capital expenditure under some degree of Government control, these sums are relatively small in comparison with those over which the Government has no control. Nevertheless, for the reasons which we have given earlier in this report, we do not think that it would be possible for the Government to attempt to influence the volume of private capital expenditure generally.  There are, however, certain exceptions to this general rule.88. In the first place banks and insurance companies have a substantial and fairly regular programme of office building throughout the country. It would be possible and desirable to attempt to secure the voluntary co-operation of these institutions in any programme aimed at the temporary slowing down of building activity to-day and its acceleration later when the need arose. We suggest, there-fore, that if an appeal is made to local authorities along the above lines, a similar appeal should be made to banks and insurance companies.89. Secondly, there is the possibility of damping down what is sometimes referred to as luxury building, namely, the building of theatres, cinemas and hotels.   The justification for singling out these classes of building would be that(a) they are especially competitive with buildings under the rearmament programme for the supplies of particular classes of labour and of materials, and(b) they could be postponed without prejudice to the industrial progress of the country. We see, however, no method of dealing with luxury building in isolation except by the control of the supplies of steel for building through a system of licences, a course which would obviously raise important questions of principle.RECOMMENDATIONS.90. In the course of the foregoing review of the programmes of capital expenditure under the control of Government Departments we have indicated at what points and by what means it might be possible to give effect to the policy of present postponement and subsequent stimulation of the less urgent expenditure of a capital nature, and we have indicated to what extent it might be possible to invite the co-operation of private business in this policy.
91. Our recommendations may be summarised as follows :  (1) Programme of the Defence Departments.That part of the building programme of the Defence Departments which does not immediately contribute to rearmament should be reviewed with a view to the execution of the works concerned at a later date.(2) Programme of the Office of Works.The policy of postponement of building works which can be delayed without serious prejudice to the public service should be continued during the present period of excessive demand. The Office of Works should be instructed to give early consideration to the preparation of additional schemes and should, if these are approved, take the necessary preliminary steps to bring these schemes to a point at which work on them could be quickly started.(3) Programme of the Post Office.A reduction in the programme of engineering works contemplated by the Post Office in the next few years and an increase thereafter would be very valuable. We suggest that the Post Office should postpone the date at which it intends to bring into effect the reduction of telephone charges which it has in contemplation.(4) Programme of the Ministry of Health.The Ministry of Health should address a circular to local authorities inviting them to prepare a programme of the capital expenditure which they have in contemplation over the next six years, to set the items in an order of priority, and for the time being to ask for sanction only in respect of those items which are of an urgent character. This circular should be followed by administrative action by the Ministry when granting sanction. Expenditure under the air raid precaution scheme, including ancillary schemes for fire brigades and police buildings, should be excluded from this policy. The Ministry of Health should consider now what steps will need to be taken to accelerate the housing programmes of local authorities when the need arises.(5) Programme of the Board of Education.The Board of Education have in contemplation an exceptionally heavy, programme of capital expenditure which will coincide with the heaviest demands of the rearmament programme. Some part of this programme, relating to elementary education, cannot be postponed, in view of statutory obligations. We suggest that further consideration should be given to the slowing down of other items.(6) Programme of the Ministry of Transport.(a) Roads and Bridges. We are agreed that those items in the road programme where there is not an element of great urgency and which, as in the case of bridge construction, involve substantial demands on industries or classes of skilled labour where supply is deficient should not be started while the present shortage of such materials and labour continues.With regard to those parts of the road programme which require mainly unskilled labour, we are not agreed. Some of us hold that, as the supply of such labour is at present excessive and as, in any case, a large pro-portion of the work will remain to be carried out three or four years hence (apart from extensions of the programmes which could doubtless be devised up to the limits of finance available) there is no need to slow down work to-day. Others of us hold that it would be impossible to ask local authorities to reduce their expenditure on housing, the health services and on education without asking them to apply the same policy to road building, that the money available for expenditure on road building could be spent with greater advantage in times of depression, and that the effect of heavy demands for unskilled labour.for road building at the present time would be to perpetuate the existing disequilibrium in the supply of skilled and unskilled workers.
All of us are agreed that preliminary steps should now be taken, e.g., the acquisition of land, which will facilitate the quick expansion of work on road building when the need arises.(b) Railway Schemes. Many of the railway schemes undertaken with Government financial assistance have already been put in hand and cannot be postponed. The Government should, however, welcome the postponement of these schemes where the companies regard that course as possible.(c) Electricity. The possibilities of postponement under this heading are small. They chiefly relate to expenditure on distribution, and this is likely, in any event, to be held up by the legislation contemplated as a result of the McGowan report.(d) Docks. There are possibilities of postponing certain work on docks in the London Area. A scheme of dock extension to be put into effect during a depression could be developed.(7) Programme of the Scottish Office.The position in Scotland is fundamentally different from that in England and Wales, as in the former country the building industry is too small, having regard to the need for housing and other constructional activity for many years to come. The Scottish Office has already requested local authorities to review their building programmes in order to determine the priority of their different building projects during the next two years, and further action along the same lines may.be required, when the review is completed.92. We are of the opinion that if action is taken on the above lines it might be possible to reduce the annual capital expenditure under the direct control of Government departments by  10 millions, and that under the direct control of local authorities by a further  10 millions below what it would otherwise have been. The work so postponed would form a reservoir which could be drawn upon in the event of a depression occurring, or in any event at the close of rearmament activity. The volume of work which would be included in this reservoir would naturally depend on the time which elapsed between the date at which the pro-gramme became effective, and the time at which signs of depression first began to appear. The capital expenditure under government control could be supple-mented in the event of a depression, not only by drawing upon this reservoir, but also out of the additional schemes which might be forthcoming under recom-mendation 2 above, by an acceleration of the housing programmes of local authorities, which might add  14 millions to the total, and by an extension of work upon roads, which might add a further  5- 10 millions. The effect of the policy recommended might thus be to reduce the capital expenditure under the control of government departments and local authorities below the normal by a maximum amount of  20 millions a year, and later to increase this expenditure above the normal by a maximum amount of  30 millions a year. We would point out, however, that the transition from the stage of maximum reduction to the stage of maximum acceleration could not take place immediately, if only because the work on new projects does not reach its maximum until at least a year after they are put in hand. The difference in expenditure between the year of maximum reduction and the year of maximum acceleration of  50 millions may seem small; but this is due to the fact that the proportion of the country&apos;s capital expenditure which falls under the control of the government is small. Nevertheless, this difference might go a considerable way towards filling the gap caused by the falling off in armaments expenditure.93. The application of the proposed policy would call for a continuous review of the situation and for close co-operation between Government departments. With this object in view we would recommend that an Inter-departmental Committee (Should be set up on which each of the Departments responsible for a considerable programme of capital expenditure should.be represented, and that this Committee should meet from time to time with the duty of advising on the co-ordination of programmes with the object of avoiding excessive demands upon the productive capacity of the industries concerned, and the utilisation of any excess capacity in these industries so far as it could contribute to the execution of programmes-already decided upon.
94. We would emphasise again that the success or failure of the policy we have proposed must depend in a very large degree on the speed with which it is possible to effect a transition from the phase of reduction of public capital expenditure to the phase of acceleration. This, in turn, will depend upon the extent to which the necessary preparations are carried out in the intervening years. These preparations include both the acquisition of sites for the works subsequently to be put in hand, and the drawing up of detailed plans and specifications. We attach great importance to the question of the acquisition of sites, and in order that subsequent stages in the preparation of schemes may not be unduly delayed we suggest that the government should consider the suggestion of taking additional powers for this purpose.95. In ordinary circumstances sites, whether for Office of Works buildings or for Post Office buildings, are acquired by negotiation and agreement, and Sites Bills are only promoted for the acquisition of sites in specific cases where, owing to the number of interests involved or to overcome some special legal difficulty, acquisi-tion would otherwise be difficult or impossible. Such Bills involve Parliamentary enquiry and controversy extending over a period of several months.96. Although the Defence Departments and the Ministry of Transport have certain powers of compulsory purchase it has hitherto been felt that Parliament would be reluctant, unless some special need were established, to grant Ministers power compulsorily to acquire land by order for civil purposes. Nevertheless, the desirability of seeking such power, coupled with the right to enter on the land before the compensation money has been determined, should be reconsidered, if it is found that, without them, insuperable difficulties are likely to be met with in acquiring in good time the sites necessary for the &quot;purpose envisaged.(Signed)F.

APPENDIX I.Capital expenditure under the direct or indirect control of GovernmentDepartments.1. WE give below the amount of capital expenditure and certain classes of maintenance expenditure incurred by Government Departments, local authorities and certain public boards on projects likely to affect demand for the output of the investment industries. The figures relate for the most part to the year 1935 or 1936 (in some cases the calendar year, but more generally the year ending the 31st March of the following year), and may be either figures for expenditure authorised in one of those years, or for expenditure actually incurred. It follows that the sum of the items enumerated below does not represent at all accurately the expenditure incurred in the calendar year 1936. Moreover, some of the expenditure authorised to be incurred is, in fact, never incurred, especially in the case of sanctioned loan expenditure by local authorities. Furthermore, a not inappreciable part of the expenditure authorised relates to the purchase of land, the payment of compensation and the acquisition of existing assets, none of which affect demand for the products of the investment industries. On the other hand, certain of the expenditure of local authorities which affects the investment industries is chargeable to revenue and excluded from the figures below.2. The sum of the following items amounts to  280 millions. For the reasons given above we think that this is an over-estimate of the true expenditure by the authorities named on the products of the investment industries.

I AM directed by the Minister of Health to communicate with the Local Authority on the question of works which involve the employment of building labour.2. The conditions under which building operations are carried out have for some time been a matter of concern to the Government. The unprecedented expansion of the building industry has been a dominant factor in the national recovery of the last few years, and this expansion has recently been manifested not only in house building but in commercial and industrial building of all kinds. This widespread development has brought with it the difficulty that under present conditions there is more work available for the industry than can expeditiously and economically be performed, even though there are more men employed in the industry than at any previous time.3. It is reasonable to assume that a further increase in these numbers would be more than could be maintained over any period of years, and would only increase the extent of unemployment which would follow upon any substantial change in the present rate of house building or of commercial or industrial development.4. The Government have given serious consideration to this problem and have concluded that the national interest would best be served by a spreading out of the volume of building work over a period of years. Such a policy would involve the postponement of works already contemplated which are desirable but not urgently necessary, and the making of plans for the execution of these and other works at a time when the conditions of employment render their execution desirable.5. The amount of building work which is under the control of the Govern-ment, of Local Authorities, and of the public utility undertakings represents a considerable total, and the application of a planned policy to these under-takings will secure considerable results, as it will also furnish an example to other undertakings.6. It may be desirable to state frankly at the outset that in one respect the Government are unable to apply this policy to work under their own control. [15717] &quot; f
Urgent considerations of national defence have rendered it essential for the Government to incur very substantial expenditure on rearmament, and this ex-penditure includes a material amount of building work. It is the essence of this programme that it should be carried out as a matter of urgency, and the maximum production for this work must be in the years 1937-1939. At its maximum the amount of building labour employed on this work will be only a limited per-centage of the building industry, but it will necessarily represent a substantial proportion of the building work which is under the direct control of the Government.7. Local Authorities will realise that similar considerations apply to certain parts of the programmes under their control also, in particular to building and other works coming under the Air Raid Precautions scheme, including therein ancillary works on fire stations and police buildings. It is not suggested that Local Authorities should in any way delay work falling within these categories.8. Subject to this point, which the Government regret is unavoidably imposed upon them by the necessities of the country, the Government have given instructions that building work on behalf of all Government Departments, both service and civilian, should be so planned as to fit in with the policy of postponing what can be postponed without detriment to a vital need, and planning for extended operations when conditions of employment render them desirable.9. The Government are confident that they will secure the co-operation of Local Authorities in this policy in its application to works under their control. Local Authorities are not unfamiliar with the system of rationing their expenditure over a perod of years as a measure of financial policy, and the Minister believes that they will find it quite practicable to apply the same principles of planning to the organisation of their building work.10. What the Minister has in mind is that each Local Authority should consider the building schemes which they have now in contemplation, and the schemes which they could usefully put in hand during the next five or six years, visualising in this way so far as practicable the pool of building work as a single unit. As the first executive task will be to consider what works already in contemplation can be postponed it will be necessary for the authority to establish some machinery for determining the relative priority of such schemes, a task on which recommen-dations to the Council might be made by the Finance Committee or by a specially appointed Committee. The first contribution to the pool of employment required for years to come would thus be secured by the postponement of works already in contemplation, but it would be insufficient to stop at this point.11. The steady development of the social services for which local authorities are largely responsible is an essential part of the Governments policy, and the sugges-tion that building works should be postponed now is made solely with the object of carrying out these works at a time not only likely to be favourable to their expeditious and economical execution, but also when their execution will provide the most beneficial results in the way of providing employment.12. For the effective implementation of this policy, planning ahead by local authorities will be of great importance. Local Authorities will, therefore, need to consider not merely what can be postponed now, but what other desirable building works they could put in hand when the occasion arises, with due regard to their financial resources. A programme of this kind will, no doubt, be compounded of projects which will emanate from the various Committees of the Council and their advisers. It is suggested, therefore, that each Committee which is responsible for building work should be invited to formulate its proposals, and that the Council should establish some machinery for translating these proposals into a provisional programme of the Council which could be put in hand when the occasion arises.13. The loans sanctioned by the Ministry indicate that approximately one-half of the building expenditure of Local. Authorities is on housing.14. It remains the definite&quot; policy of the Government to carry through the programmes for slum clearance and the abatement of overcrowding, and to attain this object in a way which will ensure that the new houses can be let at rents within the means of the lower-paid workers, and without imposing an unreasonable
burden on the rates. The cost at which houses are erected is, therefore, a vital factor in this policy, and, as Local Authorities are aware, the Minister has already found it necessary on occasion to withhold his sanction to particular proposals on the ground that the tenders were too high.15. In considering the rate at which their housing programme can be executed, each Local Authority should have regard to the building situation in their district and it will be undesirable to endeavour to crowd on to the market building work which does not attract active competition.16. An assurance has already been given of the Minister&apos;s intention to propose that the existing rates of subsidy should be payable for houses completed by the 31st December, 1938, and the Minister will, in the near future, consult with the Associations of Local Authorities with a view to making satisfactory arrangements for a further period of years.17. The housing programme will for its completion require a continuance of effort over a period of years and the Minister has much appreciated the zeal and efficiency with which Local Authorities have tackled this work. Looking to the financial interests of those who are to occupy the houses, Local Authorities will appreciate the advantage of ensuring that as large a proportion of these houses as is possible are erected at times when building conditions are favourable, and this consideration will suggest to the Local Authority the inadvisability of expanding their operations unless and until favourable tenders can be obtained.18. This factor of building cost is similarly applicable to other building works under the control of the Local Authority and, indeed, the Minister gathers that the recent increases in cost have been found to be even more substantial in larger buildings than in cottage building. No doubt these general building operations of the Local Authority do not form part of a definite programme in the same sense as does the housing programme, but the sum total of these operations over a period of years is a considerable contribution to the amount of employment in the building-trade. Where larger buildings and, particularly, those of an institutional character are in question the preparatory work will usually take a considerable time, e.g., it may be that, if the building of a new hospital were planned for 1940, it would be desirable to begin now on the work of acquiring the site and preparing the sketch plans. When, therefore, the Local Authority have planned their building programme over a period of years and determined in their own minds a provisional order of priority, it is suggested that authority should be given to those responsible to take such preliminary action as is necessary to ensure that work on the individual schemes can be started with the minimum of delay.19. It is not possible now to forecast the time when an expanded programme of public works will most usefully be undertaken, and the arrangements for postpone-ment or acceleration should be kept as flexible as possible, the object being to avoid under present conditions new building operations which can be postponed without detriment to some essential service, but to take all necessary preliminary action which will facilitate an early start on actual building operations on an expanded programme as and when circumstances render it desirable.20. The Minister requests that the suggestions made above may receive the early consideration of the Local Authority and, if desired, he will be glad to arrange for his officers to co-operate with the Local Authority in the working-out of the suggested policy.

INTERDEPARTMENTAL  COMMITTEE  ON PUBLIC  CAPITALEXPENDITURE.ON the 1st June, 1937, the Chancellor of the Exchequer appointed an Inter-departmental Committee to inquire into certain questions connected with the regulation of the flow of capital expenditure.2.   The Committee was constituted as follows :  Sir Frederick Phillips, K.C.M.G., C.B., Under-Secretary, Treasury, Chairman.Mr. A. Whitley, O.B.E., Finance Officer, Home Office. With  Mr. J. H. Burrell, Principal, Home Office.Mr. P. J. G. Rose, C.B., Assistant Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office.Mr. W. Leitch, C.B., Principal Assistant Secretary, Office of Works.Mr. J. C.

Debenham, Assistant Secretary, Economic Advisory Council, Secretary to the Committee.
eADDENDUM TO REPORT.THE report of the committee on Public Capital Expenditure was under preparation in June and July of this year. Since that time two developments have occurred which have a bearing upon its conclusions, namely, the pronounced decline in security prices in the United States accompanied by general uneasiness and a sharp recession of industrial activity in that country, and, secondly, a certain lessening of the strain under which some of the constructional industries in this country were working, brought about partly by a decline in the volume of new projects undertaken.2. It is too soon to reach definite conclusions as to the probable extent and duration of the recession in the United States. The present decline in activity is apparently connected with the accumulation of considerable stocks of semi-manu-factured goods, under the influence of an expectation of higher prices, in the spring and summer of this year. It may be some time before these stocks have been dispersed, and while they are being dispersed industrial activity will suffer. By next spring, however, it should be possible to judge more accurately what are the prospects for the future. At the present it can only be said that somewhat greater probability attaches to a resumption of recovery at that time than to a relapse into a condition of stagnation. A falling off of activity in the United States is likely to have a smaller repercussion on this country than was the case in 1929. Much has happened in the interval which has lessened our dependence on American conditions. But nevertheless anything which reduces the commodity prices of raw materials, as the setback in the United States is certainly doing, must reduce the capacity of our customers in the Empire and elsewhere to buy from this country.3. As regards the constructional industries in this country the position is that in the second and third quarters of 1937 the total value of building plans passed in England and Wales, though still very high, has been approximately 10 per cent, lower than in the corresponding quarters of 1936. In dwelling houses the decline is 12 per cent, in the six months, compared with between 6 and 7 per cent, in the case of other buildings. As direct Government building is not included in the figures, a substantial part of the decline has no doubt been offset by the increasing demands of the Government building programme. It appears likely that the demand for building labour will not be materially smaller in 1938 than in 1937.4. Nevertheless, the falling off in the number of new buildings undertaken on private account has given some relief to the pressure on the Building Industry. So far as Government building work is concerned, the experience of H.M. Office of Works tends to confirm this view.* There is, also, evidence from other sources that tendering for new works has improved during recent weeks, both in regard to the number of tenders and the stability of pricing. There is still, how-ever, definite evidence of delay in the supply of structural steel.* This Department obtains a monthly return of the contracts on which difficulties are experienced in regard to either labour or materials supply, and the following particulars, which relate to work undertaken by the Office of Works for Government Departments other than the Defence Services, have been extracted from recent returns covering the \v&apos;iole of England and Wales: Month.	Number of Current Contracts.	Number of Cases of Shortage of Labour in Skilled Trades.	Number of Cases of Shortage of Materials.August September   ... October	216 182 191	21 24 15	54 57 45It will be seen that, in regard 30th to labour and materials, the position has improved in themonth of October, but it remains to be seen whether the official figures for November will confirm this tendency.-[16364] b 2
5. The Ministry of Labour is advised by the Consultative Committee of the Building Trades in England and Wales that the industry is capable of carrying through the Government Building Programme without undue delay. The Ministry itself believes that the Rearmament Programme would not be accelerated by any general curtailment of other forms of public building activity. The peak of the Defence Works Programme is, however, far from being reached, and this programme will make increasing demands upon the labour supply market during the coming year. A further point to be noted is that many Defence schemes are on a very large scale, and are situated in remote or sparsely populated areas where difficulties are, and will be, experienced in obtaining adequate supplies of labour, owing especially to a lack of housing accommodation for the constructional workers. It is by no means certain that the tendency towards improvement in the labour supply position during recent months will, even if continued during the coming year, solve the labour supply position in these cases. It may be prudent to contemplate the restriction of non-armament building works which are not of an urgent character in the areas from which labour would normally be drawn for important armament works of the character referred to above.6. As regards the supply of steel and engineering products, the position is less satisfactory than in the case of building work. There is delay in obtaining supplies both of structural steel and of steel rods and plates, and considerable apprehension is felt about the position which is likely to arise in some six months&apos; time, when Defence Works Programmes are expected to make considerably greater demands upon manufacturing firms. There is a scarcity of skilled men for designing work in steel construction and engineering work generally, and this difficulty is experienced by both Government Departments and the fabricating firms. Contractors are also having difficulty, which seems to be general throughout the Industry, in obtaining suitable supervisory outdoor staff.7. Subject to the qualifications above it appears that any general restriction on building works could not be justified merely in the interests of rearmament. The case for such action depends on the desirability of constituting a pool of building schemes which might be put in operation as and when the necessity arises to fill a gap resulting from the cessation of the present exceptional building activity.8. If the decline in private building of which the first signs are now showing were likely to be shortlived, and to be succeeded in due course by a renewed spell of activity prolonged over several years, we should be inclined to welcome the developments noticed above as obviating the necessity for action on the part of the Government. We cannot, however, believe that this is likely. There were 8,000,000 houses in England and Wales at the Armistice and 3,500,000 have since been added, 1,500,000 in the last five years. This new building for the most part represents a net addition to the total number of houses, for few of the old houses have disappeared. The point must be reached at no distant date when the total number of houses is adequate to enable each separate family to have a separate house. That will not be an absolute saturation point, for the possibility will still remain of building new houses to replace old ones, either because these have been found unfit for human habitation or because they have ceased to meet the require-ments and tastes of house owners and tenants. The extent to which rising standards will render old property obsolescent and keep up a demand for new houses will depend to a large extent on the industrial prosperity of the country. It may, however, be safely assumed that the present rate of production of 300,000 houses a year which would replace the whole of the houses in the country in little over a single generation is unlikely to be continued for many years longer, and must be a short period phenomenon due to exceptional conditions, such as the accumulation of arrears in the past, low interest rates and the effect of a spell of prosperity following a long depression.9. It does not seem likely that the immediate decline will be rapid. The value of building plans still being passed for dwelling houses is very substantially in excess of that for any period before the. building boom developed and if present tendencies continue the demands on the building industry in 1938 or 1939, though smaller than in the last two years, will be substantially greater than will be the case when the programme of rearmament building is completed. It is the possibility of a coincidence in time between a sharp decline in the demand for
houses and the termination of the rearmament programme which is the real danger. It seems likely, therefore, that some postponement of building projects by Government Departments and local authorities to the years 1940 and thereafter will on the whole assist the orderly realignment of the building industry which will be required on the completion of the present exceptional spell of housebuilding activity.10. Our review of recent tendencies in private house building leads us to attach greater importance to those recommendations of the report which contemplate the preparation of additional schemes for public capital expenditure in the years 1940 and thereafter, than to those which relate to the postponement of existing building programmes. In the altered circumstances the conclusions of the report dealing with the programmes of local authorities require some modification. The objects which the Committee have in view would probably be achieved most easily if instead of recommending to local authorities a slowing down of expenditure, to be succeeded, at a given signal, by an acceleration, local authorities in England and Wales are asked to prepare a programme of building, to be carried out over the next five years. If a proper programme is arranged it may be hoped that, in view of existing high costs and the shortage of some important materials, the authorities themselves will tend to accumulate the greater part of the expenditure in the latter part of the period, and this tendency can no doubt be encouraged by the Departments concerned, though we understand that the Ministry of Transport would be reluctant to postpone any part of its building programme.11. In the case of programmes under the control of local authorities in England and Wales, we recommend that the alternative method set out above, which has the support of the Ministry of Health,&quot;&quot; should be adopted in place of that included in our earlier Report. As regards construction programmes which are governed by administrative action on the part of Government Departments, we adhere to the policy of the main report involving a moderate degree of post-ponement. On present indications it would not seem likely that 1938 will be itself a year in which acceleration of public works programmes is called for, and in any case the long time which such programmes take to prepare would prevent any effective action on these lines. 1938 should be, therefore, essentially a year for the preparation of plans, and for such initial work as the obtaining of powers and the acquisition of sites, with a view to being in a position, if circumstances require it, to accelerate work in 1940 or later years.12. The remarks contained in the foregoing paragraphs apply to the situation in England and Wales, and the modified recommendation in para-graph 11 relates to the programme of the Ministry of Health. In Scotland the situation as to the shortage of building labour and materials remains as described in paragraphs 78-81 of our earlier Report, and the terms of paragraph 90 (7) relating to the programme of the Scottish Office do not require modification in present circumstances.Signed on behalf of the Committee :F.
