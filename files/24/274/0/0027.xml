Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1938. SECRET. &apos; Copy No.C.P. 27 (38).CABINET.RECRUITING FOR THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE Secretary of State for War has reviewed in CP. 22 (38) the recruiting situation of the Army and has made proposals for remedying it. I have similarly been considering the recruiting problem of the Air Force and I should like to place the conclusions I have reached before my colleagues.2. In making proposals last October for the further expansion of the Air Force (D.P. (P.) 12) I felt it necessary to&quot; say : On the basis of the best evidence available, I have reached the conclusion that it must at present be regarded as improbable that we can achieve even the lower figures (i.e., those necessary to implement the Metropolitan side of the programme) by the summer of 1941, and that the highest figures we are likely to be able to obtain by that date would be of the order of 12,000 officers and airmen pilots and 96,000 other airmen.Even for the present expansion programme we have deficiencies in unskilled: recruits and, still more serious, in boys of superior education for trade training; there is conclusive evidence as regards the latter that, with rising demands, we must face a falling supply. I am forced to the conclusion that, if the expansion of the Air Force which we desire is to come about, concrete measures are necessary to, stimulate recruiting.3. Any expenditure which is really required to enable the Forces to recruit up to the strengths which the Cabinet has approved must, I feel sure, be accepted&apos; as a necessary part of the defence programme. I am, however, most anxious, not to add to the financial burden of defence and I have examined my problem with-the desire to avoid, or on the worst assumption to postpone, any such application to the Chancellor of the Exchequer as will seriously increase his difficulties. In making the pi^proposals which I outline below I have allowed full weight to the effects of the intensive publicity which is in contemplation.4.   The most direct inducement to recruits would be a general increase in-the pay of men in the lower ranks, but the cost of this would be great and the risk could not be eliminated that what was given to junior airmen might later have to be extended to those who are more senior.  I therefore propose, as regards; pay, that such increases as are necessary in the pay of soldiers to stimulate Army; recruiting should be extended only to the unskilled airman, whose emoluments are so closely related to those of the soldier that comparison is inevitable.&apos; For th^e large body of the airmen/who are tradesmen I am proposing only such minor; increases as necessarily flow from improvements in non-tradesmen&apos;s rates.   By this means the additional cost of the pay increases for the Air Force, as expanded under Scheme F, will be limited to  300,000 a year.   In taking this course, however, I would ask that it may be recognised that, in the event of eonvinuing-failure to meet the needs of the Air Force in tradesmen, I sliair1 nave mb option, but to ask for such improvements in the financial career offered to tradesmen as will serve to remedy the situation;[16677]
5. The other proposal which I wish to place before my colleagues relates to the emoluments of married airmen. The State recruits its airmen (like its solcliers and sailors) at rates of pay which are quite inadequate to support a family, oh the understanding that, when they reach an age to marry, they will receive allowances in respect of their wives and children. The age at which an airman, if married, can claim additional allowances is 26, but the /&apos; j marriage allowance &quot; then given amounts only to 7s. to 10s. a week for a wife, with additions for children. Unless he is to be separated from his wife, the airman must hire such accommodation as exists in the neighbourhood of his station, and his financial situation is such that, without grave hardship, this is commonly beyond his means. It is only when a man has completed twelve years&apos; service, and is aged 30 or more, that he is admitted to the &quot; married establishment &quot; and to full married emoluments. He then obtains allowances amounting normally to 17s. a week, together with allowances for&quot; children; and he may, in lieu of the 17s. allowance,be given a house on the station with free furniture, fuel and light.6. The hardships of the married man in the Services are well known throughout the country. I am satisfied that their removal is a just and necessary reform, and will provide an important stimulus to recruiting. I therefore propose, to abandon both the present &quot;marriage allowance&quot; and the present &quot;married establishment,&quot; and to introduce for all married airmen over 26 a. &quot;family allowance &quot; of 17s. a week, with additions as at present in respect of children. The sum of 17s., which is substantially that given at present to the men on the &quot;married establishment,&quot; is found in practice to be sufficient in normal circumstances to place the airman in a financial position to live with and maintain his wife. A &quot; family allowance&quot; at this level, together with certain minor advantages at present limited to the &quot;married establishment,&quot; will, I believe, bring contentment to the Service, and will enable me to reassure public opinion that a fair solution of the problem of married emoluments had been found.71 So far as concerns the provision of houses I propose, for the present, to do no more than to build married quarters on stations up to the very limited scale now in operation. Those who are fortunate enough to get such quarters, furnished and with free fuel and light, will be charged a rent of 17s. a week, with slight additions if two or more bedrooms are provided. Men on the existing &quot;married establishment&quot; and provided with quarters are, in effect, charged the same sum whatever the number of bedrooms they are allowed, and the small additional charges in respect of additional bedrooms will not in their case be made. The financial effect of this scheme will be a normal additional cost of  75,000 a year for the Air Force as expanded under Scheme F. There will be no additional capital charges.8.&apos; The housing of the married airmen is, however, an integral part of the housing problem of the country, and I do not think that it would be the view of the Cabinet that effective, if gradual, steps should not be taken to solve it in those, localities in which serious shortages of accommodation exist. Air Force stations are mainly in the depth of the country, and, on military as well as social grounds, I should wish that housing estates for married airmen not accommodated in quarters on the station should be in the neighbourhood of the nearest town. Such estates may be provided by Local Authorities or by private enterprise, but, tp the-extent that these agencies do not meet the need, I think that Government initiative should be taken to promote a housing scheme. I hope that it will be found that much can be done through housing associations and public utility companies, and that the provision of capital out of voted money may not be required. I propose that the Air Ministry should pursue this matter in consultation with the Ministry of Health and the Treasury in the light of the ascertained needs of each locality.February 10, 1938;
