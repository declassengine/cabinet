Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1938.MOST SECRET. Gopy No.    ^ -CP. 30 (38).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME, 1938.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE First Lord, in his Memorandum OP. 29 (38), proposes a New Construction Programme for 1938 costing  70 millions. I propose in this paper to set out very briefly the main reasons why, in my view, the Programme should be substantially reduced.2. It is true that the New Construction Programmes started in 1936 and 1937 were much larger than the Sketch Programmes for those years included in the third report of the Defence Requirements Committee [D.R.C. 37]. But the Programmes started in 1936 and 1937 were put forward, and were agreed to, on the ground that, while they would facilitate the early attainment of the proposed New Standard Fleet should that Standard be adopted, they in fact represented no more than acceleration of the Programme laid down in the third report of the Defence Requirements Committee, and that they did not prejudice the decision between the &quot; D.R.C. Fleet &quot; and the proposed &quot; New Standard Fleet.&quot;3. Further, when the accelerated Programme for 1936 was adopted, my predecessor expressly reserved the position as regards future Programmes, and stated that &apos;&apos; consideration of the further increases proposed for subsequent years (i.e., 1937 and following years) would best be deferred until the individual Programmes for those years came under examination.4. It is indisputable that the 1938 Programme now put forward involves not merely acceleration but substantial enlargement of the Fleet beyond the scale hitherto contemplated. Its adoption now must prejudice a decision between the &quot;D.R.C. Fleet&quot; and the Proposed &quot;New Standard Fleet.&quot; If the proposed 1938 Programme is approved, the Admiralty will have laid down in three years nearly as many cruisers, and more aircraft carriers, destroyers and submarines, than the D.R.C. Programme contemplated would be laid clown in seven years. If, therefore, the proposed 1938 Programme were to be accepted, adherence to the D.R.C. Standard would involve an almost complete cessation of building in certain important classes of ships from 1939 onwards for some years. I feel sure that the Admiralty would not contemplate this. Indeed, judging from the figures of New Construction given under the heading &quot; D.R.C. Fleet&quot; in Table I on page 18 of the Further Report by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (OP. 24 (38)), it is quite clear that they do not contemplate such a course. Incidentally, these figures show a much heavier expenditure on New Construction in 1939 and subsequent years than the corresponding figures given by the Admiralty in their October forecast, summarised in CP. 256 (37) and OP. 257 (37).[16702]
5. I do not, therefore, see my way to agree to a Programme which, in my view, clearly prejudices the issue of the ultimate strength of the Navy, an issue which was expressly reserved in the Interim Report of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.6. Further, acceptance of the Programme now proposed would also seem to prejudice the very grave issues which have to be considered in connection with the Minister&apos;s further Report, CP. 24 (38), and the subsequent decisions which have to be taken if the recommendations in that Report are approved.7. In conclusion, I would refer to two further points. The first is this. Though I have no special knowledge on this matter. I am bound to say that I feel grave doubts as to the advisability from the production point of view of attempting so very large a Programme in 1938 following on the huge Programmes of 1936 and 1937. We have recently been informed of the situation in regard to armour plate, which threatens serious delays to ships already laid down. We do not yet know how rapidly the existing position can be remedied, still less whether capacity can be found for the new Programme now proposed. The effect on mercantile ship building must also be considered; nor must we forget the social and industrial effect of bunching very large Programmes into a short period, to be followed by a period of slack orders.8. The other point concerns the political aspect. The First Lord proposes to include three Battleships in his Programme (one more than the number in the 1938 Sketch Programme in the D.R.C Report), although he admits that little can be done on the third ship. I gather that he is influenced in so doing by desire to create an impression on other countries. What the immediate effect would be I do not pretend to know, but in my own mind I have little doubt that in the long run we shall make the strongest impression on other countries if they find that in practice we carry out promptly and effectively the Programmes which we announce publicly.J. S.Treasury Chambers, February 14, 1938.
