Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1938.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 10 (38).CABINET.M. van ZEELAND&apos;S REPORT.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.M. van ZEELAND has now sent in his Report on the Inquiry which he was asked by the French and British Governments to undertake into the possibility of obtaining a general reduction of quotas and of other obstacles to international trade. M. van Zeeland is arranging to send copies of this Report simultaneously to the Governments of the United States, Germany, Italy, and a certain number of other countries of economic importance, and I agreed with him that it should be published immediately afterwards. The Report will therefore be issued here on the 28th instant.   (A translation of the Report is annexed.)Before completing his Report, M. van Zeeland came to see me on the 7th instant, and I had a general conversation with him, of which I attach the record. It will be noted that M. van Zeeland asked that certain parts of this record should be treated as extremely secret.Parts I and II of the Report deal with the specific questions of obstacles to the development of international trade. In these sections M. van Zeeland reviews the principal economic and financial difficulties and the remedies which have been suggested to meet them. These proposals will require study by the Departments interested, and particularly by the Treasury and Board of Trade, but do not call for any immediate decision.The immediate question is to decide what action should be taken in pursuance of the recommendations made in Part III of the Report. M. van Zeeland here proposes that a meeting should be arranged between representatives of the five Principal Powers, viz., United States of America, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, with a view to seeing if agreement can be reached on certain general principles which could be embodied in a Pact of Economic Collaboration. If agreement could be reached on these principles, he suggests that a Special Bureau should be set up to work out their detailed application.M. van Zeeland, in his conversation with me, suggested that in order to put this programme into effect we should consult with the French and United States Governments, and arrange that a joint invitation should be sent by the United States, France and ourselves (as the three parties to the Tripartite Declaration) to Germany and Italy. My first reaction to this proposal was that an invitation in this form might be regarded by the totalitarian States as a lining up against them of the three great democracies, and they might therefore be tempted to turn it down on grounds of political prestige. I suggested, as an alternative, that the French and British Governments should keep the initiative in their hands, and that, subject to consultation with the United States Government, they might invite M. van Zeeland, in the first instance, to visit Berlin, Rome and Washington, and ascertain the reactions of these countries to the proposals in his Report, and if he found that they were willing to send representatives to a meeting, to work out tentative drafts for consideration at such a meeting. M. van Zeeland expressed readiness to undertake this further task if so requested.I still feel that this is the safer procedure in order to enable progress to be made in a favourable atmosphere, and subject to the agreement of my colleagues, I propose that the Foreign Office should get in touch with the French and United States Governments and inquire if they agree with this procedure.I would also propose to send M. van Zeeland a suitable letter of thanks.N.

Enclosure.(Secret.)Note of Conversation between the Prime Minister and M. van Zeeland,January 7, 1938.THE Prime Minister began by welcoming M. van Zeeland and expressing gratitude for the great trouble which he had taken over his Mission. M. van Zeeland said that it had indeed proved a difficult task. He frequently thought of throwing his hand in, but had decided to work out as realistic a programme as he could think of.The Prime Minister said that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross had raised certain technical questions as regards the suggestions in the Report, and these he under-stood Sir Frederick had discussed with M. van Zeeland. Perhaps M. van Zeeland would like to say something on these questions.M. van Zeeland said that he agreed generally with all the comments made by Sir Frederick, except on two points : 1. Agricultural Quotas. M. van Zeeland could not accept arguments about a general glut in the market, which could be used equally to defend industrial quotas. The Prime Minister asked if a distinction could not be drawn between agricultural and industrial products, on the ground of the difference in the power to control production and output. Motor-car production could be stopped down immediately sales fell off, but agricultural crops must be harvested or left to rot. Then there were the fluctuations of output due to weather conditions. No tariff would suffice to mitigate a flood of agricultural imports. What he would like best would be to see a regulation of production by agreement, but this always took a good deal of negotiation, and in the meantime he thought that we must reserve our right, if necessary, to maintain quotas. M. van Zeeland said that he appre-ciated the Prime Ministers arguments and sympathised with them to a large extent; but he could only point out that the same arguments were used to defend industrial quotas, and we would never get the agricultural countries of Central Europe to give up their quotas on industrial goods if other countries would not give up their quotas on agricultural products. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross pointed out that, in his treatment of the question, M. van Zeeland had recognised the difference which existed between agricultural and industrial production, but that in his concluding paragraph he had only referred to seasonal gluts. Would it not be possible for him to introduce some provision about control of imports if regulation was not feasible, particularly where there was no tariff protection? M. van Zeeland said he would consider this.2. Consolidation of Clearing Arrears. M. van Zeeland felt that some consolidation over a long term was necessary of frozen arrears in order to enable current trade to be developed. He recognised, however, that there was difficulty in reconciling the rival claims on the foreign exchange resources of any country between past debts, trade arrears and current trade. It was a question of measure and consolidation might be practicable in some cases, but not in others. He would revise his text of the pages dealing with Clearings and take account of the suggestions made by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, with which he was in other respects in general agreement.Japanese Competition.The Prime Minister said that there was one point which struck him in reading M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report. He had suggested that tariffs should be reduced to an average level, and meanwhile, that they should not be increased. This might be possible as between countries which had approximately equal conditions of production; but what about the low-cost competition, from Japan, China, India, Malay and possibly Africa? Here one had to deal with countries which maintained entirely different wage levels and standards of life, and some special provision was required to prevent the old-established European industries being destroyed. M. van Zeeland said that if the Prime Minister was referring to dumping, he agreed; but if he was referring to normal competition he feared that he could not agree. There were considerable differences in the standard of life in different European countries, but you could not arrange your tariff system
to take account of these differences without preventing these standards of life from being levelled up. As regards Asiatic competition, this might in many cases be described as real dumping; but, for the rest, he believed that the European industries must make good any loss of trade by developing new lines for which they were specially fitted. The Prime Minister pointed out that this would not help a case like Lancashire&apos;s. No doubt, in the course of time the problem of Japanese competition would solve itself; but this might take generations, and for the time being something had to be done to prevent a whole industry from being ruined. He thought that here again the best solution would be some regulation of production and exports; but unfortunately no progress had been made with the Japanese about this. M. van Zeeland said that he quite understood, and he would be prepared to put in his Report something about temporary measures to meet conditions such as those described.Common Fund.The Prime Minister asked M. van Zeeland what he thought were the practical possibilities of arranging a Common Fund. M. van Zeeland replied that Mr. Sumner-Welles had been very definitely encouraging as regards the possibility of United States co-operation on economic questions. He had not said that they could join in the proposal for a Common Eund, but he had not said no.The Prime Minister said that in his view the creation of some such fund might well be essential at some stage; but he asked himself two questions. Who will contribute ? and, is the present the right moment to try and establish it \ Germany and Italy obviously could not do much, and everything depended on the attitude of America. If they were prepared to come in we would probably be able to contribute and the French would then also come in. But was it practicable at the present moment 1 The Prime Minister was not hopeful. He thought that a great deal ought first to be done to restore political confidence. Public opinion, both in the United States and in England, would insist that Germany should give assurances that any assistance she obtained would not be used for armaments. All the same, the Prime Minister felt that it was a good thing that this proposal should be put on record, even if there were no prospect of its being put into operation until the political situation had been ameliorated.M. van Zeeland agreed generally with what the Prime Minister had said. He explained that he did not expect that the Common Fund could be realised in the near future, but he thought that the suggestion was worth making in order to give the right direction to the exploration of the question. He could not say whether the United States could come in, but he repeated that his interviews with the Administration in America, and with Mr. Sumner-Welles, had been very encouraging. It might be that practical action on their part would be limited by the reactions of their public opinion - but the only way to test this was to put the proposal forward. He fully agreed that progress depended on a better political atmosphere, and therefore in Part III of his Report he proposed to work towards a rapprochement between the five Great Powers from the economic side. He thought the question must be approached very carefully and he had therefore suggested that, in the first instance, there should be a meeting or contacts between representatives of the Powers on the basis of some questions formulated in very general terms. If a favourable answer could not be given to these questions, then nothing more could be done. But if they were answered favourably, and some statement of common principles agreed upon, it would bring a new element into the political atmosphere and then, as a next stage, precise proposals could be discussed. M. van Zeeland explained that he contemplated a Common Fund to which all countries would contribute on a percentage basis. The deposits made need not be transferred to Bale, but could be earmarked in the banking centres which proyided them. The deposits would be on a long-term basis, but would vary as reserves varied. In fact, he believed that the fund would not have to be used to any large extent if the situation so developed as to enable normal forces to operate; but he agreed that assurances would have to be given that any such fund should not be used for armament purposes. Everything would depend on the spirit in which the proposal was considered, and therefore he had proposed as the first step the Pact of Economic Collaboration, which he thought would have considerable psychological value. The Prime Minister said that a pact would only be valuable if it was taken by public opinion to represent a change of heart. [16528] b 2
He instanced the failure of the Kellogg Pact. M. van Zeeland pointed out that the Kellogg Pact was signed at a time when the promotion of peace was a fashionable doctrine. Now the atmosphere for an Economic Pact was very-unfavourable as nationalism and autarchy were the principles most in favour. In these circumstances, if a pact were to be arranged it would be more likely to have some real significance and so to help in creating a better atmosphere.Further Procedure.In reply to a question from the Prime Minister as to the further procedure which he contemplated, M. van Zeeland said that he proposed to ask the French and British Governments if they would agree to his sending copies of his Report unofficially to the Governments of the United States, Germany, Italy and possibly some other Powers which were important from the economic point of view, at the same time as he sent it to the French and British Governments, and to inform them that this was done with the knowledge, .or possibly approval, of the French and British Governments. The Report ought then to be published, say, twenty-four hours later. The Prime Minister agreed that it would be best to publish very soon after so that there should be no leakages.Discussions with Germany, Italy and France.M. van Zeeland took the opportunity to explain what had passed with other Powers. A few weeks ago he offered to go and see the Germans and Italians before he completed his report. The Germans replied that they would like to see him, but they would first have to see the terms of his Report. He explained that he could not send them his report at this stage; so he had deferred his visit to Berlin. The Italians, on the other hand, had accepted his proposal and he had gone to Rome and seen Count Ciano, Signor Guarneri, the Finance Minister, and the President of the Bank of Italy. They had all expressed warm interest in his work and assured him that it would be very carefully studied with a view to seeing if they could collaborate. Before going to Rome, he had seen MM. Chautemps, Blum and Bonnet. They had been very definitely encouraging. They stated frankly that some of the points in his report would cause them a great deal of difficulty, but the general advantages to be derived from such a programme were so great that the French Government would be prepared to play their part if a practical programme could be devised. M. Blum had asked why the Soviet were not included, and M. van Zeeland had replied that they were not a first-rate economic Power in regard to international trade. Similarly, Ciano had asked whether it would not be suitable to add Japan to the list of the Five Powers; and M. van Zeeland had replied on very similar lines. In both cases his arguments seemed to be appreciated.The Next Step.M. van Zeeland suggested that the next step should be consultation between the United Kingdom and France, and if possible also with the United States, on the ground that the conjunction of the Three Powers could be justified by the fact that his Mission arose out of the Tripartite Agreement. M. van Zeeland suggested that the Three Powers should consider asking Germany and Italy whether they would join in an informal meeting with the Agenda set out in his Report. If they were favourable in principle, then he thought that the first contact should be arranged by means of an actual tour to the countries in question, so as to prepare the ground and obtain views as to possible drafts, &amp;c, before any meeting took place. If the preparatory work was satisfactory, then a meeting should be arranged of one or two representatives of each of the Five Powers. The repre-sentatives whom he thought of should be &quot;men of confidence,&quot; and neither exclusively economists nor exclusively politicians. The sort of person he wanted was Mr. Sumner Welles from America. If the meeting of these representatives succeeded, then a further meeting should -be arranged on a higher level between actual Ministers, who would be in a position to bind their respective Governments and figree upon the text of a Pact.The Prime Minister thanked M. van Zeeland for his suggestion. He had not considered this question at all fully, but at first sight he felt that there was one serious objection to the proposal. If the United States, France and the United Kingdom were to send a joint invitation to Germany and Italy it would be said
n qthat the democratic block was approaching the totalitarian block, and it might expose the former to a snub if the latter declined the invitation. He wondered if the same object could not be attained by keeping the initiative in the hands of France and the United Kingdom, and while consulting the United States, ask M. van Zeeland in the first instance to make a tour of the three countries to ascertain how they regarded his report and the proposed meeting of representa-tives. This arrangement would have several advantages. M. van Zeeland would be able to carry round drafts and compare them; if no agreement were likely, we could avoid any snub; on the other hand, if agreement were realised, we could go aheadrwith much better prospects. Meanwhile, this procedure would keep people quiet and give time for a better political atmosphere to be established. The Prime Minister was hopeful that during the next few months some progress might be made both with Germany and with Italy.M. van Zeeland replied that he thought that Germany and Italy would certainly hesitate before rejecting any proposal put to them by the three signatories of the Tripartite Agreement; but he agreed with the Prime Minister that rejection would be fatal and accordingly the Prime Ministers alternative proposal would be safer. He would be available if required. The Prime Minister asked him not to take this as a definite proposal. It would need consideration. Sir Frederick Leith-Poss said that he thought the procedure proposed by the Prime Minister would enable progress to be made more quickly, as agreement could be reached between the United Kingdom and France rapidly, but consul-tation with the United States would take time. He asked what the time-table would be.   After discussion it was agreed (a) that M. van Zeeland would revise his draft next week and send over thefinal text in French as soon as possible,;(b) that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross would arrange to have this text translated into English and a copy sent back to Brussels, if possible, by the following Monday;(c) M. van Zeeland would then send a copy of this text to Washington, andwould delay the presentation of his Report to the French and United Kingdom Governments so that it could be presented simultaneously at Washington. He would also arrange to send copies to the other countries.The following communique was agreed upon : &quot; M. Paul van Zeeland was to-day received by the Prime Minister at No. 10 Downing Street.&apos;&apos; Before completing his Report on the Mission with which he has been entrusted by the French and British Governments, M. van Zeeland desired to make contact with the Prime Minister in order to ascertain his views on the general situation, and in particular on the prospects of international action in the financial and economic sphere. In the course of the discussion M. van Zeeland summarised the result of the investigations which he has been conducting during the past year.&quot; It was agreed that M. van Zeeland should now complete his Report and he anticipates that it will be ready for presentation to the French and British Governments in the course of the next fortnight.&apos;&apos; M. van Zeeland, so far as he was concerned, agreed that the report could be published as soon as the French and British Governments had had -an opportunity of considering it.&quot;

I.-FIBST PART.   INTRODUCTORY.A. Terms of Reference. .      , ,In a communication dated the 3rd April, 1937, the Governments of France and of the United Kingdom did me the honour of entrusting me with a mission consisting, to quote the text, of &quot;an enquiry into the possibility of obtaining a general reduction of quotas and of other obstacles to international trade.&quot;In compliance with the terms of this mandate, 1 have collected the information and suggestions which form the body of this Report.E. Preliminary Question.    International Economic Collaboration ok Autarky?At first sight, it would seem that a task of this kind assumes that one preliminary question is already settled, viz. : Is it a useful thing to develop international trade? Or, in other words: are the methods, which, taken as a whole, form the system of international trade, fundamentally preferable to those autarkic tendencies which, in varying degrees, have inspired either new theories, or a series of practical measures taken in numerous places?In my opinion, there can be no doubt whatever as to the reply. It is the reply which follows from our experience of the crisis as well as from our experience of the period subsequent to the crisis.The isolated, divergent and contradictory measures by which the nations, in the first period of the late crisis, attempted to protect themselves against it, and push off the burden on to their neigh-bours, have only served to precipitate it and to render it yet more grievous for all.No country was able to escape the crisis, whatsoever may have been its means, its resources, or the degree of &quot; self-support &quot; which it had reached or retained.In certain large markets, international trade only constitutes a small proportion sometimes less than 10 per cent. of their total economic activity. Yet these countries were just as sensitive as any other to the international movements, both of crisis and of recovery.This does not mean that a State has only to allow itself to drift with the general current in order to find prosperity. Here, too, the examples are clear; they show that it is necessary to row and to steer skilfully, even to utilise and to follow the line of favourable . currents.But it does mean that no country can avoid being influenced by general movements of the international economy, whether for good or for evil.Must we conclude, then, that autarky is unattainable? Theoretically, no. It is evident that autarky is out of the question except in a large national market, dominated by an exceptionally powerful central authority. If a country, which fulfils these conditions, wished, at any price, to isolate itself from the rest of the world--economically, financially, monetarily it could do so, at any rate to a very large extent, and the existing technique won Id probably enable it to do so.But that is not the question. It is rather a matter of knowing whether such a regime theoretically possible -would, in fact, be better than the other; or, in other terms, what is the price which would have to be paid for its realisation?Such a regime involves-as its definition almost implies -an increase in the real cost of living, that is to say, a lowering of the standard of life of the population. International economic life is founded on exchanges, which only start or continue if the two parties find them to their advantage. Artificially to interrupt these currents is to deprive the&apos; country concerned of that advantage. More effort must be made in order to achieve the same result, or rather the result-will probably be less, whatever may be the effort.
In several old countries with dense populations, it is even doubtful whether under autarky the present population could continue to live, to whatever level of existence it might resign itself; the regime, if it were pushed to extremes would, in the long run, be liable to result automatically in a reduction in the number of the people.What has been demonstrated, however, by a whole series of attempts in the direction of greater economic independence, is the elasticity of the home market. Perhaps the absolute importance of the international market had, in certain cases, been exaggerated. Whether that be so or not, its relative importance appears to-day to be as great as ever; its marginal influence is real and powerful ; whatever may be the role of the home market, the fostering of international trade must remain an&apos; element of capital importance for economic prosperity within the national frontiers.C. Results op the First Tentative Enquiries.We must assume that these views are, in the long run, shared practically unanimously by all statesmen of the present day. In fact, the preliminary consultations which I undertook enabled me to ascertain that everywhere the mission with which I had been entrusted would meet with a most sympathetic reception.As regards the principle of collaboration in order to reduce the obstacles to international economic relations, not a single discordant voice was heard.The attitude adopted in all the capitals has been so sympathetic that it betokened something more than a mere polite, but platonic interest; it took the form of an active interest in an effort, the results of which could not fail to be beneficial.But if this first reception was thus far encouraging, the positive reactions, which I was able to record, were less so. I was anxious to elicit some concrete suggestions and to collect some practical proposals in order to place them side by side, to compare them, and to evolve from them the rudiments of a general solution. I could riot but note, however, that when once the first and eminently favourable stage had been passed, the attitude, almost everywhere, became qualified by a very marked reserve. It seemed that nobody wanted to commit themselves to advance in any direction, before being certain that the path had been taken, or that at any rate, it had been mapped out by several others.Besides, it must be recognised that the numerous and diverse problems, which a return to better international collaboration is bound to raise, are closely inter-related; in most of these problems, practical solutions can only be conceived in connexion with their counterparts in other directions. One can understand that statesmen hesitate to take a step forward without knowing whether others will make their contribution, and if so, in what form. So, the first conclusion, which immediately emerges, is that we find ourselves confronted with a general problem which equally demands a general solution.The following, therefore, is the general impression, which I gathered in the course of a large number of contacts: On the one hand, general interest, evident good will, a definite desire to collaborate in a general action directed towards the development of international trade;On the other hand, very great reserve as soon as it comes to the question of actually embarking upon the stage of practical solutions.However, initiatives have been taken which emphasise the general will to advance in the direction indicated: and constructive suggestions have been made, for instance, by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations during its session of June-September 1937; by the International Chamber of Commerce, in
&quot;its congress at Berlin in June-July 1987; by the committee appointed by the League of Nations to study the problem of raw materials in its report dated September 1937; &amp;c, &amp;c.Besides, a whole series of suggestions or of interesting and helpful ideas have been submitted to us in the course of our many conversations, both semi-official and private.If one takes account of all these numerous elements, then it seems possible, with some chance of success, to attempt to take action in the direction of international collaboration.I have done my best, therefore, to collect a series of proposals or suggestions which, if applied as a whole, would, in my opinion, be of such a nature as to guarantee a fresh impetus to international economic relations, and which, in the long run, would provide indubitable benefits to those national economies which would accept the programme. -II. SECOND PART. THE PRINCIPAL DIRECT OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THE MEANS FOR REDUCING THEM.The factors which most seriously prejudice international trade are to be found, some in the economic sphere properly so-called, and some in the financial sphere.Among the former, I shall concentrate on three, viz., tariffs, methods of indirect protection, quotas.Among the latter, I shall refer to sudden and excessive exchange variations, hindrances to capital movements, and restrictions on payment.I shall examine in turn each of these points, and I shall try to find the methods by which it would be possible to reduce the -obstacles which they present to international relations.A. Economic Sphere. 1. Tariffs.(a) The existence of a customs tariff is not in itself to be included in a list of the most serious obstacles to international trade. The average incidence of a tariff, taken as a whole, has its repercussion on internal prices, and especially on the cost of production; little by little, it is absorbed therein. In this way, at the end of a certain time, a sufficient degree of equality of competition is established between home and foreign producers.But there are certain characteristics which produce in the case of customs duties such harmful effects that they constitute a serious, and in some cases an insurmountable, obstacle to international transactions.We must observe, first of all, that the argument set out above applies only in cases where a tariff has existed long enough for its incidence to have become absorbed in internal prices. During the whole intermediate jieriod, the duties undoubtedly act as a kind of brake, the force of which gradually lessens, but which in the meanwhile is liable to interrupt or disturb normal or regular commercial currents.On the other hand, the diminution of the harmful effects of a tariff taken in its entirety does not extend to the damage caused by duties the amount of which is considerably more than the average incidence of the tariff; these, indeed, constitute a real and permanent measure of protection in the degree in which they exceed the average level of the tariff.For example, let us take the instance of a tariff the average incidence of which is 10 per cent.: products, in the case of which there is an import duty, of 100 per cent., will be effectively and
permanently protected to the extent of 90 per cent. It is clear that duties of this kind must be regarded as real obstacles to trade.Finally, there are tariffs which are applied to such numerous categories of goods, or which have so heavy an effective incidence, or which are so complicated that they constitute, by their very nature, a real hindrance to international transactions.(b) What means are there of improving this state of things?There is no doubt that a general movement for the reduction of tariff duties would acquire a symbolic significance, and would thus have a powerful moral effect. Unfortunately, we are bound to recognise that a gesture of this kind, however desirable it might he, does not at present come within the range of possibility.But if a policy, consisting from now onward in a progressive reduction of tariff duties, cannot be entertained in the existing conditions, other measures could be applied which would suffice to, achieve the object at which we are aiming within the limits of a more modest but more flexible plan.It would be necessary and it would be sufficient for Governments to undertake on the one hand not. to raise nor to widen the range of their tariffs and, on the other, to carry out a gradual reduction of such duties as are of an exceptional character and the amount of which is notably greater than the average incidence of the tariff. Such undertakings could, moreover, be embodied in the most easily adaptable forms, if necessary even in parallel declarations.It would be desirable that another undertaking, of a different character, should be given, providing for the suppression of duties, taxes, prohibitions or restrictions affecting the export of raw materials.Such undertakings are not of such a kind as to revolutionise existing conditions. Moreover, they could be accompanied by detailed arrangements which would cover the necessary transitional stages. The undertaking to file down the sharp points of a tariff could be spread over a certain number of years: the level finally reached could be allowed to remain above the average rate of the tariff, provided that the excess over the average did not, in point of fact, retain its prohibitive character. Finally, the suppression of restrictive measures with regard to exports need not imply the complete suppression-sion of duties, so long as their effect did not in any way injure the general economic interests of importers.But side by side with such undertakings of a general character it appears that, in the present state of affairs, the negotiation of bilateral commercial agreements, based on the most-favoured nation clause, remains one of the most efficacious methods for reducing tariff barriers.This method has recently been consistently applied by certain 4x)countries, and it has produced indisputable results.For instance, no one would under-estimate the effect which would be produced either directly, in its reaction on the two national economies concerned, or indirectly in its repercussion on the whole world by the conclusion, in a spirit of international collaboration, of a commercial agreement covering a wide range, between the two great Anglo-Saxon communities.On the other hand, the most-favoured-nation clause, in the form in which it has been conceived and applied in the years following the War, has often acted, not as a factor in reducing tariff barriers, but as a supplementary element of rigidity in this sphere. In order that the clause may completely recover its favourable influence, more respect should be paid to the spirit which originally inspired it. In this connexion, among the observations which have been laid before us, there are some which seem to be particularly well founded, and which it would be opportune to adopt in future agreements. These observations can be summed up as follows : The clause should remain, in principle, general and unconditional; Nevertheless, there should be provided an exception, allowing its application to be suspended in the case of countries which employ
inadmissible discrimination or which refuse to participate in a general effort aiming at the reduction of obstacles to international trade;Finally, it ought to be drawn in such a way as not to obstruct the conclusion of group agreements or regional pacts, so long as these do not tend to constitute a discriminatory regime, but to lower tariff barriers, and so long as they ai-e open to the accession of all those who are willing to accept the combined obligations and advantages.2. Indirect Protection.Under this general heading it is usual to set out certain practices which constitute formidable hindrances to international trade.(a) There are a whole series of regulations or of administrative practices which, by a restrictive interpretation or by an abuse of regulations in force, result in excluding certain foreign products. The best known example is the abuse of sanitary regulations in order completely to close the home market against various agricultural products.Another method consists in exaggerating the detail of tariffs and in elaborating specification to such a point that the regulations so drawn up are in fact aimed against some individual producer, while deceptively retaining the appearance of being general regulations.Finally, one must remember how often &quot;dumping&quot; is invoked as a pretext for measures which prove, in fact, to be fatal not only to unfair competition but to all competition from abroad.(b) It is, of course, right and proper that each country should defend itself energetically against any &quot;dumping&quot; methods. It is also necessary to apply strictly measures of safeguard, such as sanitary cordons. And there are cases where, failing sufficiently precise specifications, the wisest and most necessary regulations would be eluded in an improper way.These reflections &quot;serve merely to illustrate the delicate nature of the measures which we are here discussing; but in no degree do they diminish the necessity of removing the hindrances which, in fact, arise from their misuse.(1) Here, too, it seems that the method of bilateral agreements would, in the circumstances, be the best fitted to produce rapid results, whether it is a question of simplifying and stabilising customs formalities, or of standardising the criteria applied in determining the origin or place of shipment of goods as well as the value which serves as basis for the payment of ad valorem duties.It would be useful if, in such cases, the negotiators would base themselves upon the international conventions already concluded in this sphere and upon the very detailed studies on these specific points, which have been-carried out by the competent organisations and especially by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations and by the International Chamber of Commerce.(2) However, when it comes to applying the stipulations of commercial treaties, or when we are confronted by one of those unforeseeable cases such as so often arise in business life, then it is desirable also to resort to another more elastic procedure, which reserves to the parties concerned all necessary liberty of action, while preventing abuses. For this purpose, it would be wise to have recourse much more widely to the creation of &quot;Joint Committees,&quot; the opinion of which could be invoked by either of the interested parties if he feels that he has cause for complaint against some unfair practice in the nature of indirect protection.Further, in cases where this method of conciliation does not succeed, it would be desirable that interested States should undertake to accept the award of an appropriate arbitral body.There are already arbitral bodies in existence, whose good offices it would be easy to utilise for this purpose. Mention may be made among others of the &quot;Procedure for friendly settlement between
TStates of differences of an economic character&apos;&apos; instituted by resolution of the Council of the League of Nations in 1982, and the Arbitral Court of the International Chamber of Commerce.As regards specifications, in the absence of special reasons, it would be highly desirable not to go beyond the limits laid down in the Geneva Nomenclature; it ought if necessary to be possible to bring any case going beyond those limits before the arbitral body.3. Quotas.The use of quotas appears from experience to be one of the most formidable obstacles to the development of international trade. As the years go by, their arbitrary and artificial character becomes more and more evident. Even when they have been fixed according to figures which correspond to the level reached during a period of unrestricted trade, they remain harmful because they hinder desirable developments and prevent indispensable adjustments.(a) In the first place, I recommend the suppression of industrial quotas. This proposal does not exclude the possibility of spreading out the measures of suppression over a fairly long period, so that nobody should be taken by surprise. Neither does it exclude the possibility of replacing the quotas either by tariff duties, or even, if absolutely necessary and on a temporary basis, by &quot;tariff quotas.&quot; This latter method consists of applying to one and the same product a reduced duty for a certain quantity first imported, and thereafter a higher rate of duty for quantities imported after the first quota is exhausted.Further, the suppression of the quotas would not prevent the State concerned from maintaining or from re-establishing whatever measures it might consider effective in order to resist &apos;&apos; dumping &apos;&apos; methods. In this connexion it is impossible to overlook the serious problem constituted by the competition of countries whose standard of living is so much lower than that of their principal competitors that the normal conditions of international competition are thereby distorted; it is conceivable that measures may be necessary, in strictly denned cases, at least in order to give time for the necessary adjustments to take place without occasioning drastic disturbances.On the other hand, the State which suppresses its quotas appears entitled to demand the reduction or suppression of any duties imposed by other States as a reprisal against such quotas.Finally, the suppression of quotas by no means implies the suppression of international cartels. Cartel agreements proceed from entirely different conceptions and ought to be treated according to quite different rules. One might if necessary contemplate the maintenance of the quotas necessary to assure the working of such international cartels as conform to the general interest.(b) As for agricultural quotas, they have often a special character of their own which distinguishes them from the industrial quotas. First of all, there are numerous cases where the seasonal or perishable nature of these agricultural products constitutes a dominating factor; at a given moment, to import unlimited quantities of, for instance, vegetables or fruits would result in the complete ruin of a whole category of national producers. In such cases, the agricultural quotas can be regarded as aiming not so much at a quantitative limitation as at an orderly regulation of imports throughout the year in such a way as to make competition normal.Besides, the conditions which prevail in agriculture are peculiar. In times of crisis, agricultural production cannot adapt itself to the - contraction of demand with the same elasticity as is possible with industrial production. Often indeed, in order to meet the fall in prices, the agricultural community shows a tendency to increase the volume of its production. A considerable surplus has to find outlets abroad. The number of free markets diminishes. Those which remain then find that they are being swamped because upon them are
aconcentrated all the efforts made to dispose of these products, many of which are perishable and consequently have to be sold quickly and at any price they can fetch. Here, once again, we become aware of the character of reciprocity or of generality, which the solutions con-templated must necessarily present, if we wish them to be practicable or acceptable. In a case like this, the abolition of the quotas in question must be undertaken by the States principally interested, practically simultaneously.To put it shortly, in the agricultural as in the industrial sphere, the tendency should be in the direction of the suppression or reduction of quotas. At any rate, agreement ought to be reached that no new quotas should be imposed, and that no existing quotas should be tightened up. At the same time certain reservations are required in the case of agricultural quotas; quotas affecting seasonal or perishable products might be retained, but they should be made more flexible with a view to spreading importations over appropriate periods and not to restricting them absolutely; further, it might happen that in exceptional circumstances, in order to take account of the conditions peculiar to agricultural production, particularly the difficulty of restricting production at a given moment, transitional measures might prove necessary and proper, pending a fundamental solution of the problem of production.B. Financial Sphere.Of all obstacles to international trade there are none more harm-ful and more formidable than those which arise either from monetary disturbances or from restrictions regarding the transfer of capital or of commercial payments.1. The obstacles.(a) Sudden or violent variations in the mutual relation of currencies are liable to interrupt the normal currents of trade and to cause financial movements along abnormal channels (&quot; hot money &quot;) at any rate during the period while internal prices are adapting them-selves to the new monetary parity. Uncertainty in this sphere is a very grave impediment to the conclusion of business operations over any protracted period, as well as of the credit operations necessary for their normal execution.(b) Restrictions regarding the transfer of funds, even when they are limited to movements of a financial character, deprive interna-tional trade of the essential assistance of credit facilities whether on short, middle or long term, without which such trade cannot develop fully and with certainty.But these difficulties, real and serious as they are, appear slight in comparison with those which arise from prohibitions and restric-tions of commercial payments. These introduce into international economic relations an element of absolute rigidity, which renders impossible most of the spontaneous adjustment which is so necessary to the normal functioning of the system; in particular they deprive commercial relations of their triangular or multilateral character.In present circumstances, it seems that the continuance of exchange control systems and of &quot;clearings&quot; constitutes one of the most serious obstacles to the development of international trade.2. How can this situation be remedied?(a) Let us consider first of all what can be done to reduce or to suppress the element of insecurity in monetary matters.Admittedly the best policy would be to reach a definite solution of the problem of the international monetary standard. Such a solution would have to be sought in the re-establishment of the gold standard, though on a considerably altered basis. But as yet it is probably too early to make,any such attempt.   It would only succeed
if we could find that a whole series of conditions had first been realised such as would permit the return of a sufficient degree of international equilibrium both in the economic and financial spheres. Now, this situation can only come about, so it seems to me, as the result of a prolonged application of international agreements in both these spheres. The final and definitive solution of the problem must therefore be placed not at the beginning but at the end of the effort of international co-operation towards which we are aiming.However, we must find some interim solutions. There is one which does not appear to raise insurmountable difficulty, and which, while we await the hour for the final solution, should suffice to provide practical assurance of monetary security for international transactions. This would consist in the revision and extension of the agreement reached in the form of a tripartite declaration by the United States of America, United Kingdom and France with the adherence of Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland.This agreement should be adapted to the new conditions and extended in such a way as to embrace all the countries participating in the effort of collaboration.The parties interested would agree to define the reciprocal parities of their currencies, in relation to each other, and would pledge themselves to keep any eventual variations within certain limits. The undertaking should extend over a period long enough to free current commercial operations from any monetary risk; it should be for one year or at least for six months proviso being made for quite exceptional circumstances of a character practically equivalent to that of force majeure.The decision to fix the level at which the national currency would be exchanged for foreign&apos; monies clearly is a matter involving the sovereign action of each State. But, in a balanced international economy, there are obligations and limitations which each State must accept, and duties which each State has towards others. In order to be a fair one, the solution, once again, must be found in a general agreement. As for the form of such an agreement, there would be no objection to its retaining the very flexible one of joint declarations.The problem, moreover, has lost much of its extreme difficulty. Most currencies, after the devaluation operations resulting from the crisis, have recovered a relative equilibrium both as regards internal as well as external factors. Prudence advises us to retain this equilibrium on an empirical footing. On the other hand, there remain at present certain countries which have not yet reached this stage; but general agreement could be reached as to certain criteria which would enable us to determine, with sufficient accuracy and in an atmosphere of fair playj the level of monetary equilibrium, internal and external factors being alike taken into account. All that is. required is the existence of the will or the desire to arrive at a solution.This will, however, is of capital importance. Each country must, above all, rely on itself; it is for each country to take necessary action and pass the necessary measures which will make possible its participation in international action. It has the right to expect of the other States that they will not confront it with artificial obstacles, and even that they will assume a general attitude in conformity with the requirements of a sincere spirit of international collaboration. But the decisive effort is essentially the responsibility of the individual State and of it alone.Further, as soon as the international circuit has been re-established, it is probable that a whole series of our present difficulties, and especially those which have to do with credit, would soon find an .easy solution, thanks to the normal intervention of private initiative.(b) Having provisionally dealt with the question of monetary security so far as foreign trade is concerned, we now come to the disadvantages presented by the various types of restriction on the transfer of funds from one market to another.
(1) As regards movements of a financial nature, it is not only the debtor markets which have adopted such measures but also the creditor markets. The latter by forbidding or restricting foreign lending and particularly loans by means of jrablic issues have deprived international trade of a valuable support. It is exceedingly desirable that this policy should be altered in conformity with the other measures of international collaboration.(2) But the principal difficulty obviously arises from the imposition of exchange controls and from &quot;clearing&quot; systems.In this matter the only attitude which would correspond with the effort of international collaboration at which we are aiming, and which would enable a country to resume its normal place in the framework of the international economy is the renunciation of the system in question, that is to say, the abolition of exchange controls and clearings.Such a measure must of course be introduced by stages; it is only possible if a certain number of preliminary conditions are realised and if precautions are taken to ease the transition.The recourse to clearings is a consequence, direct or indirect, of the establishment of exchange controls. The latter are themselves the result of a state of disequilibrium between the national economy concerned and the international markets. To attempt to get rid of exchange jcontrols while allowing this disequilibrium to persist would be a waste of labour. But the measures suggested to us, both in the economic and in the monetary sphere, are designed precisely to facilitate a return to equilibrium. To this end measures must be taken, of which many depend solely on the will and the decision of the State concerned, but some are also dependent on the co-operation of other States. It is in this atmosphere and these conditions that the freeing of the exchanges might be and should be induced.If the object at which we must aim is a return to complete freedom of all movements of funds, it is clear that what is most urgent and important is to free&apos; commercial transactions themselves and the settlements to which they give rise.It is easily conceivable that, in certain cases, measures of control would have to be maintained, at least temporarily, in order to prevent capital movements which might endanger equilibrium after this had been restored.However that may be, the first and most urgent step is to bring about the suppression of all restrictions on payments for merchandise.Whether, however, it is to be carried out in one or in several stages, the suppression of exchange controls requires that the past should first be liquidated.The liquidation of the past implies an agreed adjustment of external debts which weigh on the country, as far as may still be necessary and warranted; such adjustment should be carried out in conditions, with regard to interest and amortisation, which should take into account modifications which may have arisen in the respective situations of creditor and debtor; and they must also take into account the general purposes of common interest to all which the measures studied in this report are designed to promote.But the liquidation of the past, also and above all, implies the settlement of the clearing arrears. In this connexion we must distinguish between, on the one hand, the arrears which arise out of old credits completely immobilised and regarded as only payable little by little in the manner of a sinking fund on a long-term debt, and on the other hand, the balances on current trade and the current financial debts arising out of recent transactions which.are due to be paid in full and without any long delay under the operation of the clearing itself. . \For the arrears of the first category I propose to recognise realities and to have recourse as far as possible to consolidation. It seems to us that any attempt to take the other course, in so far as it
umay succeed in expediting the liquidation of these heavy debts of the past, weighs on the present by reducing the resources which the debtor country could use for imports of goods.In all cases in which such consolidation might prove practicable, it should, however, be carried out in a form which would make it possible to guard, to some extent, against the difficulties which it might otherwise entail for the creditor firms.To this end, it would be desirable in particular that the bonds issued to the creditors by the debtor State should be expressed in the-currency of the creditor at the parity fixed in the exchange agreement.In addition, it would be well to envisage some land of extra&apos; facilities for mobilising the bonds for commercial purposes with the help, if necessary, of international institutions.As regards the other arrears of a current nature, these should be-treated in the same way as the new debts, which will be incurred under the restored regime of freedom.The past having been liquidated in this way, it would be desirable to ease the transition. For this purpose it would be necessary to provide those countries which have been freed from restrictions with credit facilities which would remain at their disposal during the period of adjustment.These credits should enable them, on the one hand, to afford the necessary support to their export trade, and on the other to finance a-part of their imports at least at the start.It would seem possible to secure this object to a certain extent by an agreed extension of the method of reciprocal credits recently instituted by the Bank for International Settlements. The Banks of Issue would open through the Bank for International Settlements credits in favour of one another in the national currency of each of them. These credits would be used to finance the exchange of merchandise between the countries concerned. The exchange risks entailed by these credits can be set off against one another in so far as the trading operations balance. As regards the remainder, the risk might be in part covered by a multilateral clearing carried out by the Bank for International Settlements acting as clearing agent..For the balances, that is to say, the amounts which the Bank for International Settlements could not cover by clearing, it would be advisable to have recourse to the forward exchange markets where these are active and broad. Elsewhere, it would seem advisable to attempt to set up forward exchange markets whose terms would not unduly burden commercial transactions.For the final balances which could not be covered otherwise, it would be necessary to require a special obligation the payment of which would in the last analysis have to be made by the debtor State. This risk would, in any case, be slight and of a temporary nature.   In practice it would be quite a negligible burden.But apart from this system; in consideration of the general advantages which the freeing of commercial settlements would bring, and in consideration further of the fact that this freedom would be based on the measures adopted by the interested parties to re-establish the external equilibrium of their economy, it would be appropriate that a united effort should be made by all the States prepared to join in a programme of international co-operation.Among the suggestions brought forward to give effect to this idea, there is one which appears to me to merit special considera-tions; this is, the possibility of establishing, through co-operation of all these States, a common fund the resources of which might be applied, under appropriate conditions, to facilitate the financing of legitimate trade operations during the period of readjustment.It seems to me that the international organisation designed to assume the direction of such a fund woidd be the Bank for International Settlements.The activities of the fund should not in any case overlap or compete with those of existing institutions and organisations whose
business in normal times covers the financing of the commercial -operations. It would come into play only in special cases, to fill permanent or temporary gaps, where normal methods prove insufficient.It may be added that, in this sphere, more than in any other, it is highly probable that the necessity for these exceptional methods -useful and, no doubt, indispensable during the period of transition  would very soon disappear. If the international economy were to recover its vigour and flexibility, private institutions would quickly respond, in the majority of cases, to the normal needs of business on almost all the international markets.III. THIRD  PART.    GENERAL   CONDITIONS   NECESSARYFOR SUCCESS. .I am convinced that, the loyal and general application of- a plan composed of suggestions such as have just been outlined might result in giving a new and considerable impetus to international trade.But if I were to conclude my report at this point, I would not have fulfilled the essential part of my mission.indeed, the important matter is not to provide a theoretical definition of the difficulties, nor even to indicate the means by the application of which they could be solved. The main point is to suggest methods which have some chance of being effectively adopted and of leading to concrete results. We must therefore push our examination rather further, so that we can discover the conditions in which such measures as are recognised as being useful or -desirable will have a chance of being effectively applied by the great majority if not by the totality of the interested countries.We must, at this point, admit the considerable difficulties which cumber the ground. If wo consider the political plane, reasons to hope for a rapid and cordial rapprochement appear slighter than at any moment since 1918.If we place ourselves on the economic plane, it seems at first sight as if the most favourable moment for strictly economic collaboration were past. The general check in the recovery movement, and the special economic difficulties of certain great countries, are once again bringing back on to the programme schemes of national protection, which bear a remarkable likeness to the efforts of the crisis period.In the course of the last few months I have several times had to modify the provisional conclusions which I had reached. I have postponed the submission of this report in the hope of collecting fresh indications or of witnessing the appearance of more favourable -circumstances. At one moment, seeing the obstacles piling up, I asked myself whether it were not preferable to give up attempting at the present moment any major effort of collaboration in the sphere -of international economics, and to await a serener atmosphere.But, taking all in all, it seemed to me that such an attitude would have been sterile, and even dangerous. One has never the right to renounce action or, at any rate, to renounce&apos; attempted action. No effort is ever completely lost, even if it does not succeed all at once.On the other hand, the persistence of a general situation, which is very confused and bristles with contradictions, would incur the risk of very serious consequences, both in the political and in the economic order. More and more numerous are they who take account of this fact and draw the conclusion that a rapid and profound reaction is necessary. In such conditions, the moment is perhaps favourable, in spite of appearances; for a new attempt, based on reason and common interest.Let us try, therefore, to find the way for a practical solution, without going beyond the limits of this mission, which is of an economic character, but without pretending that it can be artificiallj isolated from the political factors which surround it and which impost upon it their conditions. *      *&quot;
A. The Exact Position of the Problem.The first reflection which occurs in this connexion is that tin? difficulties which we have just been examining all interlock; in the same way the solutions which we have suggested are closely inter-dependent. Tariff policy, exchange control, capital movements, stabilisation of currencies, quotas, clearings, &amp;c, are closely connected problems. One cannot hope really to solve them except by means of a comprehensive solution.On the other hand the attitude of a number of countries is dominated by the policy of certain Great Powers whose economic influence is a determining factor either for the world as a whole, or for certain parts of it. It is necessary then, in order that any solution should achieve its maximum efficacy, not only that it should cover the whole network of interlocking difficulties, but also that it should unite a very large majority, if not practically all of the-nations concerned.But international trade is not an end in itself, it is only a means directed towards an end. This end cannot be other than the improvement of the standard of life of the masses, the increase of the well-being of the population. Under our present organisation this end is pursued by national entities.Here we reach the heart of the problem. In order to diminish the obstacles to international trade and to restore to it a degree of flexibility which will allow of its development, it is necessary in particular to induce many countries to mitigate or to abandon the measures of protective self-sufficiency which they have adopted in different degrees and at different times, and to return to a more complete system based on the international division of labour. But these measures of national protection were not resorted to lightly or frivolously, and if the countries protected by them still retain to-day the armour which they felt bound to put on, it is not without serious reasons.We must therefore make our dispositions in such a way that the new system shall offer to all participators advantages greater than those of the position in which they now find themselves; and at the same time that the transition from one system to the other may be brought about without danger, and even with immediate advantage.As our task is, above all, to achieve practical results, it is not-necessary to enter into a long analysis of the reasons which have provoked all these measures of national protection. Nevertheless, it is necessary to underline certain characteristics of the present situation.Once more let us emphasize the futility of the arbitrary distinc-tions based on views or arguments of an over-simplified nature, in the light of which attempts are made to divide the nations into-distinct groups. In fact, we do not find on one side States devoted to a policy of complete autarky, and, on the other, States faithful to a strict observance of international free trade. If we go beyond appearances and refuse to be satisfied with verbal distinctions, we cannot fail to note that on the one hand all States, one after another, have had recourse to measures of their own, differing widely in conception and effect, but all inspired by the idea of national protection; while, on the other hand, they have all continued, and must continue, to submit to a system of international exchange.Movements so general and so pronounced must without doubt have a deep-seated cause. Let us recognise that international economic relations are to-day on a very different basis from those of the period before the War. Formerly international exchanges were exchanges affected across frontiers between individuals, private firms or private interests. To-day international economic relations are taking on more and more a character of exchanges between economic units constituted by the States themselves. It is true that the part played by the private firms and undertakings which operate on either
side as the connecting links in commercial exchanges remains without exception an essential one, but in determining the flow of trade considerations of national interest are assuming more and more importance; transactions are every day more and more dominated by decisions emanating from the constituted authorities and inspired by a national economic policy. That is a fact which we must take into account.The tendencies which are driving States towards a greater degree of economic autonomy are based on widely differing considerations. Some of these tendencies are purely political in their origin: others are based on considerations of a social order, such as the problems of unemployment or of the adaptability of labour: others again are due to purely economic anxieties.Among the latter there is one which is loudly invoked in several countries in which an effort is being made to substitute synthetic raw materials for the corresponding natural products, and which may be summarised as follows : If the countries which are producers and exporters of raw materials refuse to take payment in manufactured goods, or place obstacles in the way of entry of such goods into their own country, the countries which are importers of these materials find themselves obliged to give up buying them, or at least to limit their purchases as much as possible; they must thus devote themselves to finding other sources of these same products or look for products which may take their place, especially synthetic products. The protectionist policy of the countries which are producers of raw materials thus reacts against themselves as well as being damaging to those who were counted among their traditional customers.At the same time it must be added that this line of argument, though not rejected in principle, is regarded in other quarters as putting the problem in an over-simplified form or even as reversing the true order in the allocation of responsibility; according to this view, we are in the presence of a vicious circle brought about in the first instance by the reduction of the importation of certain staple world products by countries which formerly imported them.However this may be, in spite of the ravages of the last crisis, in spite of the profound modifications which the international economic structure has undergone, in spite of the increasing difficulties of all kinds with which business men are faced, international commercial exchanges had nevertheless until recently shown signs of renewed vigour, a striking proof of their inevitable necessity. The volume of international trade had returned during the second three months of 1937 to a level corresponding to that reached in 1929, that is to say, at the height of the period of prosperity. Alas, we are still looking for the means of freeing ourselves from these hindrances; and already we are threatened with a fresh set-back!Is it simply a flattening of the curve, is it a minor crisis, or must we fear worse&quot;? The economic policy which we now adopt may, if it is good, mark the beginning of a new era of prosperity in the world; it may also, if it is bad, transform the present hesitations of trade into a new and more serious crisis.It therefore becomes more urgent than ever to restore inter-national economic relations to a sound basis.The events of the last few months have served to emphasise another aspect of the problem. International trade may not only be impaired by causes of an economic and financial nature; it may suffer equally severely from political and even from moral influences. For economic activity to develop it is not sufficient that a demand should exist, that the products should be available and that capital should be abundant; there must also be the will to show enterprise, to act, to run the risks inherent in the production and exchange of goods. These conditions require an atmosphere in which at least a certain degree of confidence, goodwill, sincerity, order and clarity prevails in international relations.
B.-Actual Hindrances. Let us   therefore   seek to determine in a spirit of complete objectivity what are the difficulties or obstacles which, without being direct impediments to international trade, nevertheless hinder the smooth flow of commercial relations between nations.(1) Review of the difficulties.There are those who see the origin of their difficulties in the unequal distribution of raw materials, or, more exactly, in the fact that certain great countries do not possess in the territory under their control the raw materials which they consider themselves to require.At this point we cannot but record that certain States see no solution to the problem except in the redistribution of colonies.There are others who attribute their difficulties to the exaggerated protectionism of countries or groups of countries which ought in their view to absorb a larger share of their production. Particularly numerous are those who protest loudly against systems of preference which distort the normal channels of trade.Others again blame the unequal distribution of capital and the lack of adequate understanding on the part of the great markets which dispose of accumulated funds.Certain States insist on the important influence on their economy of demographic problems, particularly those connected with emigra-tion and immigration.Intelligent judges do not fail to emphasise the depressing influence on financial markets both in the moral and practical sphere of the absence of a definite settlement of international political debts.Many circles put the blame above all on the effects of the wide-spread policy of intensive rearmament. They express anxiety at the probable reaction which will take place when the orders due to rearmament will have reached saturation point; they emphasise the disastrous effects which the budgetary burden of rearmament imposes, or is liable to impose, on national economies, either directly or through its indirect repercussions.Finally, there are many who maintain that political anxieties are a determining factor in the present retarding of trade, and that these anxieties are more of an obstacle to the development of international commercial relations than all other hindrances put together.There is no doubt that repeated shocks to the basic principles of international law exercise a pernicious influence on economic as well as on political relations between the nations. It is time to bring back to light the sanctity of plighted engagements and the necessity for respecting the rules of international law.Whatever may be the degree of truth contained in these various assertions, we are bound to take the assertions themselves as facts and to see in them problems which call either directly or indirectly for solution.(2) Siii/uested Remedies.Suggestions have indeed already been made in widely varying directions with a view to solving these different points. It would be impossible to enumerate them all, and I shall confine myself to reproducing a certain number which seem to me to have aroused interest in many quarters.With a view to assisting the solution of the colonial problem, it has been suggested that the regime of mandates should be revised, that the national element should be removed, and that the, system should be made completely international, both from the economic and the political point of view.In the case of colonies properly so called, it would perhaps be opportune to seek for the means of generalising the system of the open door which obtains in the Conventional Basin of the Congo, a system the general result of which it is impossible to criticise.
In those colonies where such a regime cannot be organised, certain circles have recommended that the possibility be examined of creating privileged companies, whose activities would be strictly limited to the economic sphere and whose capital would be divided internationally in such a way as to offer real guarantees of impartiality.With regard to raw materials a most interesting proposal has been formulated tending to the supply of colonial goods in exchange for industrial products. An agreement would be concluded between a colony and an industrial State, and colonial goods supplied would be carried to an account and paid for by the execution in return of important public works bridges, railways, ports, &amp;c. The inter-mediate finance would be provided by the metropolitan State.Lastly, the rules of international law might, in the opinion of many, be specified and re-enforced in such a way as to secure from seizure or confiscation in every case, even in time of war, private property held in colonial territories, whatever the nationality of the owner.(3) Guarantees of a Political Nature.The conclusion which arises to my mind from the multiplicity of problems inherent in these complaints, demands and suggestions is that it is time to face them and submit them to a close discussion. This, however, can only be done in an atmosphere of loyal co-opera-tion in which each one concerned would seek in his own interest to render assistance to the others.Does such a spirit exist? If not, everything possible must be done to create it. If it exists, steps must be taken to dissipate the mutual misunderstandings which prevent it from coming to light.Surely there is no object in attempting to conceal from oneself the difficulties of such an undertaking.In this report I have deliberately debarred myself from touching on the strictly political aspects presented by a number of questions with which we are faced. It is, however, impossible to ignore the fact that we are working in their shadow. There are, indeed, some which are so intimately bound up with certain of the suggestions which I have made that it is impossible to abstract them.Thus one can understand the preoccupation of those who fear to see the financial assistance, &apos;the credit facilities, or the facilities for obtaining supplies which would be granted in the execution of the present programme of action diverted from their object to serve warlike ends. Guarantees would have to be provided in this respect, and such guarantees are necessarily political in their nature.Again, is it possible to provide an economic solution for the difficulties with which certain national economies will be faced when the point of saturation has been reached in their rearmament policy without evoking the problem of the limitation of armaments?Conversely, it also appears to be true that any concerted policy for the limitation of armaments would require, if its application were not to be obstructed, to be accompanied by economic measures which would also have to be internationally concerted.C. A Pact of International Collaboration.Faced with a task of this complexity, our best course will be to attempt a new method very general in its nature, which should appeal to mutual goodwill, but the object of which will be above all to secure to each participant the tangible advantages of collective action.The moment has thus perhaps arrived to propose the conclusion of a &quot; pact of economic collaboration &apos;&apos; embracing the largest possible number of States, and in any case open to all. This pact might perhaps, drawing inspiration from a precedent which has proved successful, take the form of a collection of joint declarations.
The object of the pact would be to assist the participants to raise the standard of living of their nationals by improving the general well-being. It would contain two parts, one negative, by which the participating countries would bind themselves to abstain from a certain number of practices contrary to the interests of the community of participants; the other positive, but general in its nature, by which the participating countries would bind themselves one towards the other to take up and to examine in a spirit of under-standing and mutual assistance the problems and difficulties arising in their economic relations.Under the aegis of this general pact, and in accordance with its spirit, might be concluded separately other more detailed arrange-nients incorporating, in so far as they could be satisfactorily worked out, the numerous suggestions which I have made or referred to in this report.I have given these suggestions deliberately in a succinct and simplified form: I have intentionally refrained from entering into details; it has been my object to confine myself to the principal outlines. If the ideas on which these suggestions are based should be acceped, it would be comparatively easy to develop them, to give them precision, and to run them into the appropriate technical moulds. On most of the points which I have mentioned, prolonged studies have been undertaken; plans for putting them into effect could be quickly drawn up with the assistance of specialised organs such as the Economic and Financial Committees of the League of Nations, the Bank for International Settlements, the International Chamber of Commerce, the International Institute of Agriculture, &amp;c.As for the international arrangements for putting them into force, certain of these by their very nature would have to be of general application; others would include only certain countries; others again would have to take the form of bilateral agreements.D. Methods of Realisation.How are we to assure practically and effectively the success of such a plan?Let us recognise that to obtain the full results it would be desirable that an effort of this kind should receive the support of the great countries which are leaders in economic activities and in the different political tendencies.(1) It is desirable, then, to bring together as soon as possible representatives of the principal economic Powers; at least of France, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Germany and Italy. There would be advantages in a method which would ensure that this contact were of a purely preparatory nature. The object would be above all to take soundings and to prepare the ground. The agenda would contain four or five questions drawn up in some such terms as the following : 1. Are you agreed to take part in an attempt at international economic collaboration? 2. Do you, with this object in view, accept as a basis for discussion the main lines of the present report? 3. What are the points in this report, if any, which you would wish to see either omitted or emphasised? 4. What points not mentioned in this report do you think itdesirable to include within the scope of the attempt to beundertaken?The answers given in the course of this preliminary and informatory stage would clearly determine the future course of the whole undertaking.(2) If, as may be hoped, the answers were constructive and such as to encourage a serious hope, it would be appropriate to pass to a second stage.
This stage would be entrusted to a bureau appointed for the purpose; an invitation would be addressed to all States asking them to acquaint the bureau within the shortest possible time, and follow-ing the outline of the present report, with the difficulties which they meet with in their international commercial relations, as well as with the measures of assistance which they feel entitled to expect from other States and those which they are prepared to render.The answers to this invitation would constitute substantially a review of the complaints brought by the nations against the economic commonwealth, and of the needs for the satisfaction of which outside assistance or collaboration would be more effective than national effort.The bureau would proceed as rapidly as possible to classify and synthetise these answers. It would analyse their contents in an entirely objective manner, extract from them such suggestions as seemed reasonable, and would so draw up, basing its work on the present report, a programme of constructive action.(3) It is then that we should pass to the third and final stage of the undertaking. It would be necessary to ensure through the diplomatic channel that there was an agreement of principle among the interested parties on the main lines of the programme drawn up. If a sufficient number of States, including the great economic Powers, took up a favourable attitude, the bureau referred to above would be instructed to draw up the texts for signature.Lastly! a conference would be summoned to put the final touches to the necessary diplomatic instruments and to exchange signatures.As I conceive it, the pact so concluded would be only a portico to the work which it would be necessary to continue, to build up, to complete and to adapt to changing circumstances in a process of perpetual evolution.Nevertheless, the conclusion of such a pact would be a gesture of capital importance, for it is this pact which would give the initial impulse and would impart to the world the impetus which it is awaiting in order to recover its confidence in the pacific destiny of nations.And this portico might perhaps lead to a new edifice where, side by side with the halls devoted to economic collaboration, would arise others in which might be worked out the political conditions of a lasting peace.P. van ZEELAND.Brussels, December 24, 1937.
