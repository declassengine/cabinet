1^ At its meeting on 26th January, 1938,  the Cahinet had&quot;before it a joint memorandum by the Secretary of State forScotland and myself (CP. 2 (38)), asking the approval of our colleagues to the preparation of a Rabbits Bill for introduction into Parliament as soon as an opportunity could be found.      Itwas then decided:&quot;(a)    That the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should investigate the prospect of the passage of the Rabbits Bill, and should take up with Parliamentary Counsel the drafting position of agricultural Bills as a whole with a view to establishing whether there was sufficient prospect of passing the Bill to justify inviting Parliamentary Draftsmen to prepare it:(b)    That the decision should be reserved until the Report of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was available.&quot;2. In accordance with this decision, I have consulted the Chief Whip, who informs me that it is practically certainthat, even if the proposed Bill passed the Lords,  it would beimpossible to find time for it in the Commons during the current session.3, I have also been in touch with Parliamentary Counsel,from whom I understand that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is very heavily engaged with the preparation of other legislation for this Session and with the matters arising therefrom, and would find difficulty in giving the necessary time to the drafting of a Bill which stood little chance of being dealt with by Parliament during the present Session. 4. I have also had in mind that,  should the opportunitypresent itself later in the Session, it may be desirable for me to seek Cabinet approval to the introduction of a further.SECRET.

agricultural measure (dealing with the poultry industry) which is of greater importance than the Rabbits Bill, and which should take precedence of it.5. In the circunistances, I suggest that no further action should be taken at the present time with regard to the proposed Rabbits Bill.6. I have consulted the Secretary of State for scotland on the matters set out in the foregoing paragraphs, and he concurs with my views.(Intlld.) W.S.M.16th February, 1938.
