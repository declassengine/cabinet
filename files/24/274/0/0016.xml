Q-JLI-J^-JUl^Jtl^^ CP.16(28 ).CABINET.HOUSING  (RURAL YfORKBRS ) ACTS , 1926-1955.Memorandum by the Minister of Health and secretary of State for Scotland.1.     We desire to obtain Cabinet authority for the introduction of a Bill to prolong these Acts and to make certain minor amendments therein.    The Acts, which consist of the Housing (Rural Workers) Act, 1.926, and two Acts of 1931 and 1935, extending that Act, apply both to England and Wales and to Scotland and are due to expire on the 24th June of this year.2.      The object of the Acts is to assist owners to recondition and improve cottages for agricultural workers and persons of similar economic condition.    To this end local authorities are empowered to make grants not exceeding two-thirds of the estimated cost of the works subject to a maximum grant of  100 a house.    Half the amount of any grant made is repaid to the authority by the Exchequer.    The grant carries with it a condition that for the next 20 years the house may only be occupied by an agricultural worker or similar person and the rent may only be raised to cover interest at a prescribed rate on the proportion of the cost of the works which is not covered by the grant.3.      As our colleagues are probably aware, the Acts have been operated with varying success in different parts of the country.    So far as England and V/ales are concerned, the powers of the Acts have been operated energetically and favourable results obtained in a number of counties.    In other areas little has been done, though as a result of recent pressure by the1.
Ministry of Health the position is gradually improving.   The total number of cottages improved in England and Wales since 1926 is just over   16,000.    The following figures show the recent increase in the average number of cottages improved each year:-Period. Yearly Average.1927 - 34 1,3121934 - 36, 2,170In Scotland the Acts have been very extensively used in nearly every county.    The total number of dwellings improved since 1926 is 23,380 and during the past eight years the average number of dwellings improved each year has been about 2,900,We are satisfied that there is considerable scope for further work under the Acts   and we therefore recommend that both in England and Wales and in Scotland the period of operation of the Acts should be extended to the 30th September, 1942.4.     We desire to include in the Bill the following minor amendments of the Acts, the first three of which have been recommended in the Report of the English Rural Housing Sub-Committee, while the fourth is based on a recommendation of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee -(a) On a breach of the special conditions on which agrant has been made, the owner should be required to repay, not as at present the whole of the original grant, but a fraction of the grant proportionate to the fraction of the 20-year period which remains unexpired at the date when the breach occurse(b) Local authorities should be empowered to pay a grantby instalments during the progress of the works, provision being made that the advances are not to exceed a suitable proportion of the value of the work done at the time when the instalment is paid.(c) The owner should be required to show separately inthe rent book the rents charged respectively for the house and for the land in cases where the house is let together with a holding of land.(d) Local authorities should be empowered to giveadditional grants to assist owners to remedy overcrowding in dwellings which have already been improved with grant under   the Housing (Rural Workers) Acts.   The amount of the additional grant would be limited to two thirds of the cost of the works .and would not in any circumstances exceed  50o
5.      It is desir-e-d also &quot;to take the opportunity of making a small amendment to meet an, administrative difficulty which has arisen in England and Wales.    Gases occur in which the local authority for the purposes of the Acts is a county district council as regards a particular district, and the county council for the remainder of the administrative county. In such cases.the Acts provide for the expenses of the county council being treated as expenses for &quot;special county purposes&quot; and accordingly not chargeable on the county district which is itself administering the Acts.    This works satisfactorily where a county district has administered the Acts from the outset.    But if the administration was handed over to it some years after the Act of 1926 was passed, the position under the law as it now stands is that expenditure by the county council in the shape of loan charges for grants made towards houses in the district at a time when the county council was administering the Acts in the district are none the less expenses for &quot;special county purposes&quot; and, therefore not chargeable on the district.    This is obviously inequitable and, we suggest,  should be put right by the Bill.6.      It will be necessary to make two additionalamendments to meet the following difficulties which have arisen in Scotland:-(a)   Where a dwelling in respect of which grant is given was not let at a rent before its reconstruction the local authority have to determine a normal agricultural rent, to which the owner may add the increase of rent permitted by the statute *    The Court of Session have recently decided that in such a case the local authority are bound by the terms of the statute to arrive at the normal agricultural rent by taking an average of the rents actually paid by agricultural workers in their district.    Local authorities would have serious difficulties in doing this and in certain burghal areas where there are no agricultural workers it would be impossible to carry out the provisions of the statute as interpreted by the Court of Session.   We therefore propose to amend the statute to provide that the normal agricultural rent shal be the rent which the local authority determine to be the rent normally paid by agricultural workers and persons of substantially the same economic condition m their district,,
1*71(h)   Where a grant has been given to a crofter who is entitled to compensation from his landlord in respect of the improvement carried out with the grant the statute provides that if compensation becomes payable to the landholder the part of the compensation attributable to the grant shall be paid by the landlord not to the landholder but to the local authority.   When the Housing (Scotland) Bill of 1935 was before parliament the Government admitted that the recovery of part of the. grant from the landlord was inequitable and undertook to amend the statute at the first opportunity.The amendment of the provisions relating to the determination of the normal agricultural rent will have toapply to England and wales as well as to Scotland.7.      The Report of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committeesuggested that in order to maintain satisfactory progress in scottish counties where expenditure under the Acts was likelyto prove burdensome, additional Exchequer assistance beyond thenormal 50 per cent.should be made available.       The countieswhere the burden of expenditure is most likely to impede progressare those in the Highlands and Islands and it is, therefore,proposed to give Exchequer contributions of 75$ instead of 50$in these counties.    The proposal will not involve a heavy charge on State funds and no new principle is involved since inconnection with the Housing (Agricultural Population)  (Scotland)Bill similar treatment for counties in the Highlands and Islandswas agreed to by the Cabinet on 3rd November, 1937, and hasbeen accepted by the House of Commons.K.W. W.E.E.26th January, 1938.
