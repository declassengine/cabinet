FIFTH REPORT.CONSUMPTION AND  SUPPLY OF CINCHONA ALKALOIDSIN THE EMPIRE.I. Introductory.The subject with which we deal in this report is the problem of securing that adequate supplies of quinine should be available within the Empire to meet the needs of the very large numbers of the population, particularly in India, who suffer from malaria. The problem has two aspects. In the first place, we may consider what steps could be taken to increase the consumption of quinine in the Empire to a level corresponding more nearly with what, from a medical standpoint, may pe regarded as its true requirements, so that at least a considerable proportion of those who suffer from malaria should enjoy the benefits of proper treatment. Secondly, we may consider whether quinine might not be obtained more cheaply, and an increase in consumption be thus assisted, by a considerable exten-sion of the scale on which quinine is produced within the Empire, and further, whether such an extension would not in itself be desirable on other grounds, even if no reduction in the price of quinine and no increase in consumption were to result.II. Anti-malarial therapy and quinine requirements.2. In its first aspect the problem is one which is common to most countries in the world. Malaria is the most important of all the diseases affecting the inhabitants of tropical and sub-tropical climates, and its geographical distribution is widespread. In certain tropical countries, such as Indo-China, Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, and the Federated Malay States, malaria alone accounts for from 10 to 56-9 per cent, of the total number of cases of infectious diseases treated in hospitals and dispensaries. The world-wide nature of the problem has been recognised by the League of Nations which, through its Health Organisation instituted inquiries regarding the quinine requirements of malarial countries and the world prevalence of malaria. In 1925 the Malaria Commission of the League of Nations estimated that no less than 981,840,000 ozs. of quinine would be required annually in order to provide even as little as 40 grains of quinine for every malaria case in the world. In 1982, as a result of a questionnaire circulated to the Governments of malarial countries, the Health Organisation estimated that the amount of quinine required by governments to meet the existing needs of malarial countries lay somewhere between 1,172,000 and 1,387,000 kg., or between 41 and 49 million ounces approximately. We may compare with these figures the present world consumption of quinine of approximately 2l  million ounces.3. One of the most striking features of the calculations referred to in the preceding paragraph was the figure given for the require-ments of British India. This was 680,700 kg.* or 24 million ozs., -an amount more than equal to the present consumption for the entire world. Another estimate which has been given places the require-ments of India at 226,800 kg. or approximately 8 million ozs.* But even the higher estimate does not appear extravagant when it is recalled that the number of persons suffering from malaria in India has been calculated at 100 millions (quoted in the Annual Report for 1932 of the Public Health Commissioner with the Government of India). The number of indoor and outdoor cases of malaria treated in the hospitals and dispensaries of British India in 1988 was 12,784,000. The mortality from malaria in India has been estimated at 500 per 100,000 of the population, or 1,180,000 deaths annually. But besides this annual death roll the disease gravely impairs the health and efficiency of the many millions who suffer from it.4. Similar calculations have been made regarding the situation which exists in-important areas of the Colonial Empire. We have already referred to the prevalence of malaria in the Federated Malay* Quoted in Annual Report for 1922 of Public Health Commissioner with, the Government of India.
States, where admissions from this cause represent 56-9 per cent, of the total admissions to government hospitals. Perhaps, however, the most notable contrast which appears to exist between the incidence of the disease and the scale on which it is at present treated is to be found in the West African dependencies. In Nigeria, for example, an inquiry by Barber and Ollinger relating to many individuals in the least infected age, showed that about 60 per cent, of the persons examined were infected. If this proportion is applied to the population of the Southern Provinces, estimated in 1929, at 8,750,000, the number of malarious individuals for these areas alone would be 5,250,000, for whose treatment 105,000 kg. (approximately 3,700,000 ozs.) of quinine would be required. At present the quinine requirements of the whole Protectorate are estimated by the medical and sanitary administrations at 1,269 kg., though it is stated that this amount will probably increase with the development of the system of native dispensaries recently instituted. In existing conditions the consumption of quinine is very largely confined to the urban and European sections of the population. Again, in the Gambia, practically the whole population of 210,000 is stated to be affected by the disease, but the average number of cases treated from 1926-30 in hospitals, dispensaries, &amp;c, was 1,880. In the Gold Coast, with a population of 2,984,000, intermittent inquiries which have so far been carried out have shown that the percentage of cases with enlarged spleen was always more than 25 per cent. On the other hand, the number of cases treated in 1980-81 was 25,593, though this number shows a marked increase compared with previous years, owing to the opening of infant welfare clinics, and the work of travelling dispensaries, as well as to the general spread of knowledge of the benefit to be derived from European medicine. In Sierra Leone in 1980, the examination of 2,671 children showed that the spleen index was 46 per cent, in Freetown, and 79 per cent, in the rural schools. The parasite index was 45 per cent., while amongst adults in the Northern Provinces from 1927-29 it was 57 per cent. These figures show that the endemic incidence in Sierra Leone of the disease is high. In 1930, however, the maximum number of cases treated in hospitals and dispensaries was 6,095 out of a total popula-tion of 1,600,000. The amount of quinine required was estimated by the health administration at 584 kg. 820 gms. If we assume, however, that at least 10 per cent, of the population ought to be treated, the amount of quinine required, at the rate of 20 gms. per case,* would be 8,200 kg.5. Similar instances might be quoted from other parts of the Empire of the need for larger supplies of quinine and for more adequate facilities for treatment. It should be emphasised that these two needs are intimately connected. &quot; It would be a mistake to suppose that all that is required for a successful campaign against malaria is an abundant supply of quinine. It is possible to work out figures showing the world or Empire requirements by calculating what quantity of the drug would be needed to treat the estimated numbers of sufferers from malaria. But quinine requirements in this sense cannot be identified with the demand for quinine. No doubt the demand can be increased very considerably by a reduction in the price. Undoubtedly at its present price quinine is in most cases beyond the means of the Indian peasant or the African native. But price is not the only factor. Those who have direct experience of the native populations in Africa, for example, lay emphasis on the difficulty of securing a large increase in the consumption of quinine merely by retailing supplies at greatly reduced prices or even by free distribution. This view was supported by several of the supplies received to the questionnaire issued by the League of Nations in the course of the inquiry referred to above. The Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, Gold Coast, for example, expressed the opinion that no ordinary African would take a sufficient dose over a sufficiently long period to effect a cure, even though it were at little or no cost to himself. He added, however, that the retailing of quinine through post offices and postal agencies* The figure quoted is that adopted by the Health Organisation of the Loague of Nations in an inquiry carried out in 1932 (published as C,H/Malaria/ 185). A much larger quantity would of course be required to effect a complete cure.
might be tried. In Swaziland, again, quinine is at present distributed free of charge at the headquarters of all districts and at all police posts, mission stations and trading posts in the malarial areas, but the natives do not take full advantage of these facilities, and it is stated that if adequate distribution is to be effected, it would be necessary for this to be carried out by kraal to kraal visits during outbreaks of malaria. Other replies received supported the view that an increase in consumption of quinine will depend not only on the provision of adequate supplies at low cost but also on an extension of facilities for the distribution of the drug. In Nigeria, for example, the amount of quinine used is expected to increase with the develop-ment of the system of native administration dispensaries recently instituted. In Tanganyika a similar increase in consumption is expected to follow the creation of new tribal nursing formations. The obstacles, therefore, to a more widespread use of quinine include not only the cost of the drug but also the ignorance and apathy of native populations. Quinine is unpleasant to take, especially over the extended period necessary to effect a complete cure as opposed to the temporary relief of acute attacks of the disease. It is said to lead to attacks of dizziness and in some cases to certain forms of eye trouble. Nevertheless, there is little -doubt that even the most uneducated classes will make use of the drug, once they understand its value, whenever they have an attack of fever and provided that adequate supplies can be made available.6. The provision of ample supplies of quinine will not alone suffice to overcome the ravages of malaria. It must be coupled with adequate means of distribution and supported by a system of propaganda and enlightenment which will convince the native of its efficacy and ensure that the treatment is properly applied. The difficulties of the campaign against malaria are by no means every-where of the same order. In towns, villages, plantations and mines a solution will be comparatively easy provided that the necessary funds are available. In rural districts the task will be harder. The Pan-African Health Conference in 1985 strongly emphasised the view that unless the economic and cultural level of rural populations can be raised there can be little hope of employing curative or preventive measures with any degree of success. Adequate diet, healthier dwellings, more widespread education are all of them needed if anti-malarial measures are to be fully effective. At the same time, it would be difficult to overestimate the importance from an economic aspect of a successful campaign against the disease. The provision of anti-malarial drugs, together with the measures necessary to educate native populations in their use, should, we feel, be given an important place amongst the essential social services directed towards the building up of national health and efficiency in the countries affected. Malaria inevitably brings with it impaired efficiency and economic distress. Indeed, we believe that there could hardly be a more important contribution in present circumstances to the prosperity and well-being of tropical countries than an effective attack upon this disease.III. Production of quinine in the Empire.7. If the consumption of quinine amongst the populations of the Empire is to be greatly increased, it is essential that supplies of the drug shoukUbe obtainable at the lowest possible price. The limits to effective action by governments to provide quinine for free distribution, together with the necessary organisation to bring the drug to the native, will be dictated by the possibility of finding the necessary funds. -But whatever the sums which may be made available for this purpose there still remains the further question whether-such funds would be better employed in the production of quinine by the governments themselves or in the purchase of the necessary supplies in the market. With this question there is bound up a second, namely, whether it is not desirable to encourage the production of .quinine within the Empire either by the State or by private enterprise, not merely in the hope that it will be produced more cheaply, but in order to lessen the dependence of the Empire upon foreign sources of supply. These two questions are to some extent separate.   The production of quinine within the Empire might
still be desirable in order to give increased security in time of war, even though to do- so might involve increased cost and therefore to that extent lessen the efficacy of a given expenditure devoted to an anti-malarial campaign. At least, however, it may be said that if there appeared to be any prospect of producing quinine within the Empire at a cost which would compare reasonably favourably with the price paid for foreign supplies, the advantages of self-sufficiency in this product would furnish an added argument in favour of extending Empire production.8. The facts in regard to quinine production are well known. Quinine is obtained from the bark of the cinchona, a tree originally found only in South America. Cinchona species were introduced into the British tropical possessions in about 1860 and twenty-five years later Ceylon had become, and for a time remained, the principal source of supply of the bark. For example, Ceylon exported in 1887 nearly 16,000,000 lbs. of bark. Since that time, however, a striking change has occurred in the position, and to-day about 97 per cent, of the world supply of cinchona is furnished by Java. In the report of the Indian Trade Enquiry published in 1922 by the Imperial Institute, the following estimate of the world&apos;s annual output of cinchona bark was given : lbs.Java        ............      23,000,000(l)India       .........      ...   .     2,000,000(2)Other countries......... 400,000(3)25,400,000(&apos;) Estimated annual output during 1911-13.p) Estimated annual output for years 1912-13 to 1915-16.(3) Estimated annual output for 1910.It will be seen that according to this estimate Java produced at that time about 90 per cent, of the total world production, while the next most important producer was India with a production of about 8 per cent, or 2,000,000 lbs.        &apos;9. The production in India was formerly much larger, amounting in the year 1899-1900 to 4 million lbs. At that time cinchona cultivation had made great strides both in southern India and in Ceylon, where there exists a large European planting community. Cinchona was grown extensively both in Ceylon and throughout the Wynaad and Nilgiri-Wynaad of southern India. In Java also big extensions had been made in the cultivation of this crop. The result was that the European market was glutted and the price dropped to a point at which cultivation was no longer profitable. Very large areas under cinchona both in southern India and in Ceylon went out of cultivation and were used for the production of tea in its place. In Java the effects of the crisis were less severe owing to the fact that the volcanic soils of that island were found to be particularly suited to the growing of C. ledgeriana. This species of cinchona has been found difficult to cultivate except under certain definite conditions of soil, climate, elevation, rainfall, &amp;c. Other species, such as C. officinalis and C. succirubra, are more hardy. Their yield of alkaloid is, however, lower than that of C. ledgeriana and the total alkaloids yielded by them contain a lower proportion of quinine. Although cinchona alkaloids, such as cinchonine, cinchonidine and quinidirie, have been shown to be effective in the treatment of malaria, medical practice has always preferred quinine for use in routine treatment of the disease, and this circumstance, coupled with the suitability of the soil and climate of Java for the cultivation of C. ledgeriana, has helped to secure a dominating position to the producers of that area.10. Nevertheless, in the years before the war, there was still a considerable surplus of production over the existing level of demand for cinchona and in consequence the majority of the producers in Java entered into an agreement for the restriction of production on lines somewhat similar to those adopted in recent years in the case of such products as tea, rubber, tin, &amp;c. At the present time the production of cinchona in Java is said to be restricted to approxi-mately 50-60 per cent, of the productive capacity available.
11. The arrangements for the control of cinchona cultivation were, moreover, reinforced by an agreement between the producers of cinchona and the manufacturers of quinine. In the early stages, quinine manufacturers of various countries, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, participated in the agreement. Later, however, a new agreement was made whereby the quinine manufacturers in the Netherlands and Java took the whole of the output allotted under the original agreement. There still remain, however, certain producers in Java who are outside the scheme. In addition, there are certain plantations in Java which are in British ownership. Bark from this latter source is imported for manufacture into the United Kingdom. Nevertheless it may be said that the world output, and hence the price of quinine, are virtually under the control of the Netherlands organisation, which is known as the Kina bureau and has its headquarters at Amsterdam.12. This position has aroused criticism on various occasions in the past and attempts have been made to expand the production of cinchona within the Empire with a view to lessening its present dependence on foreign sources of supply. The only considerable source of supply within the Empire is in India, where Government quinine factories and cinchona plantations were established in the sixties of last century. India consumes on the average between three and three and a half million ounces of quinine per annum, of which one and three-quarter million ounces are obtained by impor-tation, the remainder being produced by the factories in Burma, Madras and Bengal. In 1916 the Government of India took steps to investigate the possibility of obtaining enough suitable land in India to produce sufficient cinchona bark to supply the whole require-ments of India and the greater part of the needs of the Empire. An exhaustive survey was undertaken by Lt.-Colonel A. T. Gage, I.M.S., at that time Director of the Botanical Survey of India and Superin-tendent of cinchona cultivation in Bengal, in the course of which he examined some thirty localities, in Southern India, Burma and Assam.18. The choice was finally narrowed down to three areas, the Mikir Hills in Assam, the Anamalai Hills in Southern India, and the Tavoy-Mergui tract in Burma. These areas fulfilled to the greatest extent the primary conditions of temperature, rainfall, altitude and soil necessary for the growth of G. ledgeriana and the secondary conditions of absence of prevalent high winds and freedom from destructive hail storms. The district also had the advantage of accessibility and facilities for transport. A detailed survey was carried out of a selected area in the Tavoy District by the quinologist to the Bengal Government, and the manager of the Mungpoo plantation in Bengal.14. It had been a part of Colonel Gage&apos;s recommendations that the Madras and Bengal cinchona Departments should be amalga-mated, and, together with the new plantations and factory in Burma, should form a single Imperial Department. Owing, however, to the introduction of constitutional reform shortly afterwards, this part of the scheme was abandoned and the Madras and Bengal Govern-ments remained responsible for the plantations in those provinces, while the newly established plantations in Burma were placed under the control of the Government of India. The initial experience with the areas planted in the Tavoy District, was unfortunate. Heavy rains washed away the plantations in 1921 and 1922. Fresh planting was undertaken, however, in the Mergui District in 1928, and the programmes adopted contemplated an annual extension of 250 acres.15. It was hoped at first that India might not only become independent of imports from abroad for her supplies of quinine, but might also be able to make an appreciable contribution towards reducing the &quot;dependence of the Empire upon foreign sources of supply. These hopes, however, have not been realised, and at the present time India still imports more than half her annual consump-tion of quinine, while her exports are negligible and are confined to a small quantity of a certain kind of cinchona bark known as
druggists&apos; bark. In view of these facts it may appear somewhat paradoxical that one of the principal problems which have called for consideration in this connection during recent years has been the accumulation of stocks of quinine in the hands of the Government of India. The stocks held by the Central Government were considerably depleted during the war, and steps were accordingly taken in 1919 to replenish them by the conclusion of a contract with a firm in the United Kingdom for the supply of bark for manufacture in India. A similar agreement was subsequently entered into in 1921 with certain Netherlands producers. The object in view was to restore the stocks held by the Government of India to a level of 250,000 lbs.16. By December 1923 Central Government stocks had reached a figure of 271,000 lbs., and the question of quinine policy was reviewed by a Conference of representatives of the Government of India, Bengal and Madras, assisted by Public Health experts. At this Conference it was agreed that in future the Government of India&apos;s quinine policy should be directed towards supplying the official and trade requirements of the Indian market only. It was also agreed that the Central Government should exercise a general super-vision over cinchona cultivation and prices, and that so long as India was mainly dependent for its supplies on foreign sources there should be no attempt to break away from world prices.17. In April 1928 the stock of quinine held by the Government of India had risen to 361,495 lbs. The total annual official demand had dropped to 60,000 lbs. as compared with a figure during the war years of 80,000 lbs., notwithstanding the fact that the price of quinine had fallen from the war time level of Bs. 30-35 to Bs. 18 per lb. This situation was considered by &quot;a further conference similar to that held in 1923. The conference advised that there was no practical prospect of the Government of India ever being able to capture the market in India and that policy should be confined to supplying the official or Government demands for quinine for official institutions. They further recommended that 250,000 lbs. of quinine should be set apart as a permanent reserve against any grave malarial epidemic, and that the balance of the accumulated stock should be utilised for increasing the general consumption in India. As an inducement to provincial Governments to increase their consumption, it was suggested that the Government of India should offer to sell quinine .at the rate of Bs. 14 per lb. as against the usual price of Bs. 18.18. As a result of these recommendations the quinine policy of the Government of India was restricted for the future to the provision of sufficient quinine to meet official requirements. The scheme, however, for increasing sales to local Governments received no support from these Governments on the plea of lack of funds. By the end of 1928 it was estimated that stocks of quinine would amount to 450,000 lbs. Attempts were made to find a solution of the difficulty by seeking to implement the recommendation of the -Royal Commis-sion on Agriculture that cinchona cultivation and the manufacture of quinine should be placed under a single Central Department. In this way it was hoped to make quinine available at a low price without imposing undue financial sacrifices on the provinces in which cinchona cultivation was carried on. In 1931, however, after consultation with the Governments of Bengal and Madras, these proposals were definitely rejected as a result&apos; of financial and constitutional difficulties.19. In 1932 a further effort was made to increase the sale of quinine to local Governments by offering it to them at the price of Rs. 12 per lb. for all quantities purchased over and above their existing average requirements. This offer also met with no response. Subsequently, however, surplus stocks were reduced chiefly by the allotment of 45,000 lbs. in 1935-36 to provinces for free distribution. 10,000 lbs. were also sold during the year 1934-35 to the Ceylon Government at the time of the malaria epidemic.20. As a result of these unsuccessful attempts to increase consumption the Government of India were compelled to suspend any extension of the Mergui plantations and to retain those only on a care and maintenance basis.    Tt appeared likely that increased[16002] c
production would have led only to an increase in stocks which would have been all the more unjustifiable in view of a recommendation put forward by the Central Public Health authorities that a reserve supply of 150,000 lbs. of quinine would be sufficient for any national emergency.21. Recently, as a result of the separation of Burma from India, the future of the Mergui plantations has been under consideration. The Government of Burma having examined the question of main-taining the plantation decided that they could not commit themselves to do so at the expense of Burma revenues. They accordingly informed the Government of India that if that Government desired to continue the plantation they would willingly consider the question of granting them a lease of it. The Government of India have hitherto declined to accept this offer. The present position, therefore, is that cinchona cultivation wis to be discontinued in those areas in Burma which were developed as a result of Colonel Gage&apos;s inquiry in 1919 (see paragraphs 12-14 above). Moreover, as a result of thf-experience of recent years, the plantations of the cinchona depart-ment in Bengal are not being exploited to the fullest extent possible. We are informed that in recent years bark collection has been largely confined to clearing up dead and dying trees and to collection from coppice growth. Of the total existing acreage of 2,667 acres, 228 acres are aged between 11 and 15 years, and 220 are over 16 years of age. If worked on a nine-year rotation, the area under cultivation would allow of 300 acres being harvested each year. If this were done, however, the quantities of bark and crude quinine sulphate accumu-lated would be so large that heavy expenditure would be incurred in storage facilities.22. Steps have also been taken to initiate cinchona cultivation in certain parts of the Colonial Empire, notably in Tanganyika, the Cameroons, and Malaya. This question has been considered on more than one occasion by a Sub-Committee of the Colonial Advisory Council of Agriculture and Animal Health. The most recent report of this Sub-Committee was submitted in January 1985. At that time a grant had recently been sanctioned from the Colonial Development Fund to enable one hundred acres of land to be used for the experi-mental planting of various species of cinchona at the East African Agricultural Research Station at Amani in Tanganyika. The Sub-Committee recommended that further funds should be made available to enable a further fifty acres to be established under cinchona in ten-acre plots in sites selected in different parts of the Usambara Hills, with a view -to testing the suitability of those areas for the cultivation of different species of cinchona.28. The Sub-Committee quoted in their report an estimate which they had obtained from the Superintendent of cinchona cultivation in Bengal to the effect that the minimum output required for a quinine factory, if the best results were to be obtained, was in the neighbourhood of 15,000 lbs. of quinine sulphate per annum. It was held that a production of substantially less than this amount would scarcely justify the maintenance of the scientific and technical staff indispensable to the specialised work of quinine extraction. Factory production on this scale would require a plantation of 1,200 acres in extent to produce the necessary supplies of bark. A smaller factory would, however, no doubt give satisfactory results in the production of mixed alkaloids as a cheap febrifuge.24. The Sub-Committee also suggested that the Government of Nigeria should be advised to arrange for a series of experimental trials similar to those advocated in the TJsambara Hills of East Africa, in order to test the suitability of the highlands of the Cameroons for the cultivation of different species of cinchona derivations to meet the requirements of West Africa.25. These -recommendations were endorsed by the Colonial Advisory Council of Agriculture and Animal Health, and accepted by the Secretary of State. Copies of the report were transmitted to the Governments of Tanganyika Territory, Kenya and Nigeria, with a request for their observations. In reply, the Tanganyika Government expressed the view that no further experiment was needed to
demonstrate the suitability of the Usambara Hills for the cultivation of cinchona. He asked to be advised whether the establishment of a State-owned plantation for the production of cinchona bark with a view to the local manufacture of a cheap febrifuge would be justified.26. This question was considered by the Sub-Committee, who took the view that it would not be desirable to embark upon a large State-owned plantation enterprise. Provision had already been made for the establishment at Kwamkora Estate belonging to the Amani Institute of 100 acres of cinchona plantations, and there was evidence that coffee estates in the Usambaras would be prepared to undertake cinchona cultivation if they could be supplied at low cost with cinchona plants suitable *for planting out. The Sub-Committee suggested, however, that the position should be re-examined in live years&apos; time when data would be available concerning the growth of the plantings at Kwamkora and the extent to which private enterprise had taken up cinchona growing. In view of the fact that the suitability of the Usambara area in Tanganyika could be accepted as having been established, the Committee recommended that experi-mental tests should be made in a few selected areas in Kenya or Uganda where conditions held out some hope of success. The Sub-Committee also suggested that future experimentation in the Cameroons was desirable in the interests of the British dependencies in West Africa. The Sub-Committee took note of the decision which had been reached in the Federated Malay States to establish a series of trial plots in selected localities distributed over the Cameron Highlands. This decision is of particular importance, since, in the Sub-Committee&apos;s opinion, Malaya is the only part of the Colonial Empire where the present consumption of quinine is sufficient to justify the erection of a factory. As regards cinchona grown in other parts of the Empire, the most practicable suggestion appears to be that the manufacture of the bark should be undertaken in the United Kingdom.IV. The need for an Empire quinine policy.27. The account which we have given in the preceding section of this report shows that up to the present no great success has been achieved in extending the cultivation of cinchona in the Empire beyond the point at which it has remained since the collapse of the cinchona boom at the beginning of the nineties. Indeed, the most recent developments in India have been in the opposite direction, and this tendency must be weighed against the measures which have been taken to develop cultivation in colonial territories. We feel that if substantial progress is to be made, a fresh attempt must be made to formulate a definite policy in regard to quinine for the Empire as a whole, to estimate the total consumption both actual and potential in Empire countries, and to consider how far this consump-tion is to be met by the purchase of supplies and how far by increased production within the Empire.28. An important factor which has influenced the consideration of this question in the past has been the possibility of new discoveries in the development of synthetic remedies for malaria. For example, in December 1925 a sub-committee of the Committee of Civil Research was appointed to consider what steps, if any, should be taken to secure the production within the Empire of adequate supplies of quinine. On the 5th July the sub-committee reported to the Committee of Civil Research as follows : &quot; (1) That any general scheme for the extension of cinchona cultivation in the Empire would be premature pending the receipt of information regarding the scientific value of beprochin, on which they have asked Sir Walter Fletcher and Dr. Balfour, in consultation with other experts, to submit a Report. (2) That whatever the value of beprochin or other synthetic products may be found to be, it will probably be necessary to create additional plantations if the Empire is to be self-sufficing in the production of quinine and subsidiary cinchona alkaloids.[16002]
(8) That, as a first step, a grant at the rate of  2,000 a year for ten years should be made to the Amani Institute to enable it to restore and extend its previously existing cinchona plantation, with the object of (a) increasing Empire supplies, and (6) undertaking experimental research.(4) That these recommendations should be submitted by the Committee of Civil Research to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs for the favourable consideration of the Empire Marketing Board, with a view to the grant by the Board of the funds required to give effect to them.&quot;29. It will be seen that &quot; the adoption of any general scheme -of cinchona cultivation in the Empire &quot;m was to be given further consideration in the light of information to be obtained from Sir Walter Fletcher and Dr. Andrew Balfour regarding the scientific value of beprochin a recently synthesised anti-malarial remedy, later called plasmoquine and other synthetic products. To obtain this information, a special Investigation Committee on Cinchona derivatives and malaria was set up by the Medical Research Council, consisting of Dr. Andrew Balfour, Dr. (now Sir Henry) Dale, and Colonel S. P. James, and their report was submitted to the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research on the 5th August, 1926. While it is impossible to quote their report in full, it may be said that the Committee came to the conclusion that the solution of the problem of malarial treatment lay rather in the promotion of organised investigation with a view to the discovery of better artificial anti-malarial remedies. They pointed out that the available evidence at that time indicated that quinine and other cinchona alkaloids would encounter serious rivalry from new anti-malarial remedies. In particular, they suggest that stovarsol an acetyl derivative of arsenic acid which, on reduction, yields salvarsan plasmoquine, and ethyl cupreine, a higher homologue of quinine, all promised to give better results in the treatment of malaria than quinine.80. With the synthesis of atebrin by Mietzsch and Mauss in 1930, and the discovery of its effectiveness in curing malaria, it seemed that the prophecy of the Investigation Committee on Cinchona derivatives and malaria in 1926 was about to be fulfilled, and that their expressed doubts as to the desirability of stimulating a great increase of cinchona planting were justified. It is certainly true that atebrin has a number of distinct advantages over quinine in the treatment of malaria. It compares favourably, for instance, with quinine in ridding the blood of malarial parasites and in relieving symptoms. Unlike quinine it is pleasant to take, and in the earlier days of its use, it was thought to be almost non-toxic. More extended use, however, especially in the recent epidemic of malaria in Ceylon, has shown that it frequently leads to serious toxic symptoms, and the view is now widely held that atebrin should only be given under medical supervision. This, of course, is an almost insuperable drawback to the extensive use of this drug in countries where a great number of the inhabitants suffer from malaria. Recent evidence, moreover, indicates that the number of relapses which occur in cases of malaria apparently cured by atebrin, is nearly as great as the number of relapses occurring after treatment with quinine. On the whole, therefore, although atebrin and the more recently discovered derivative, atebrin-musonate, are very useful drugs in the treatment of malaria, they will certainly not replace quinine during an epidemic or in mass treatment for the disease, largely because their administration requires medical super-vision, in contrast to the quinine and cinchona preparations, which are safely taken by the &quot;patients themselves. Plasmoquine has also proved to be too toxic for general use. Generally speaking, therefore, it can be said that quinine and its allied alkaloids still hold the field in the treatment of malaria, and, although there is still the possibility that better anti-malarial drugs will be synthesised in the future, the nature of the problem, and especially the epidemic form in which malaria develops among the poorest populations of mankind, make it unlikely that the demand for quinine will be reduced. Such considerations suggest that in any programme of research directed
to the synthetic production of antimalarial drugs the synthetic production of quinine itself should be given high priority.81. In these circumstances, therefore, we can no longer regard it as justifiable to defer consideration of the problem of Empire quinine supplies on the grounds that cheaper and better synthetic substitutes may become available. In our view a time has come when it is urgently necessary that this important question should be examined and a concerted policy agreed upon for the Empire as a whole. It is not the function of this report to examine the various aspects of this question in detail. As we suggest below, we consider that for this purpose a special inquiry should be instituted in which the Governments of India and Burma and Colonial Governments should be asked to co-operate. We may, however, outline briefly some of the questions which should in our judgment be included in the scope of this inquiry.82. Clearly the starting point of any such investigation must be the existing level of consumption of quinine in the Empire, the extent to which this corresponds with the medical needs of the territories concerned and the possible increase which might be brought about in this consumption. We have quoted in an earlier paragraph (paragraphs 3-4) the estimates which figured in the League of Nations inquiry showing the very great disparity between the present level of consumption in most countries and that which would be required to meet the true medical needs of the population. The most important point, however, which requires consideration is whether any steps can be taken to increase the actual consumption of quinine. We are aware that in some territories and with some sections of the population this is a somewhat intractable problem, in that even a considerable reduction in price is unlikely7 to have much effect on the consumption of quinine. Here the&quot; needs of the situation can only be met by free distribution and, what is equally important, by the development of methods of distribution, e.g., through schools and post offices, or through native dispensaries. Education and propa-ganda will also be essential to encourage a proper use of drugs amongst native populations. The progress which can be made in these directions is in existing circumstances limited by lack of the necessary funds. But we suggest that in weighing the possibilities some attempt should be made to judge of the effect which a successful anti-malarial campaign would be likely to have upon the economic life of the country and hence ultimately upon its revenue producing capacity.83. But, in addition to those sections of the population of the Empire whose consumption of quinine would be comparatively unresponsive to a reduction in price, there must be large numbers, especially in the more developed territories, whose means would suffice to buy quinine in small quantities if it could be made available at a sufficiently low price. For example, it has been suggested that in India there is a considerable section of the population consisting of those who are rather better off than the poorest classes, who would be anxious to buy quinine in small packets at a price of one anna a packet. Such a packet might contain twenty to thirty grains of quinine, a quantity which if taken daily for a week of more would suffice to relieve an attack of fever. It would be of great value if an estimate could be framed along these lines showing what level of consumption might be expected to follow upon a given reduction in price. Indeed, such an estimate would be an essential preliminary to any measures designed to bring about an increase in the consump-tion of quinine in the Empire, an object which we regard as being of the highest importance.34. In the light of the data obtainable regarding the present and potential consumption of quinine in all parts of the Empire it would next be necessary to consider how that demand might best be satisfied. This would necessarily raise the question whether cinchona cultivation should be developed in the Empire. In order to answer this question it would first be desirable to consider the view that self-sufficiency in quinine supplies is a necessity on the grounds of security in time of war, even if this could only be achieved at the cost of a considerable sacrifice which could only be borne either by taxpayers in general or by consumers of quinine.   In
this connection experience of the last war and evidence regarding the possibilities in regard to storage of quinine would presumably be of value.85. Apart from considerations of this character, we may assume that the principal object in view is to obtain supplies of quinine for the Empire in the cheapest and most economic manner possible, and it is from this standpoint that the question of developing cinchona cultivation in the Empire is to be considered. Here it is important to bear in mind the character of the marketing organisation respon-sible for the supply of foreign quinine. It is sometimes objected that cinchona cultivation can never be carried on in the Empire with advantage in view of the much lower costs of production prevailing in Java. This argument, however, ignores the fact that the present market price of quinine is not the result of normal competitive conditions, but is determined by the policy of the Kina bureau. It may quite well be the case that the Netherlands East India possess natural advantages for the production of quinine, which it is difficult to match elsewhere. But the considerations which ordinarily apply in deciding whether or not it fs desirable to encourage the growth of a new industry in competition with foreign producers must be modified in a case such as the present where the producers in question form a powerful monopoly. In such a ease a comparison of costs does not alone furnish a sufficient basis on which to form a judgment, since the price charged by the monopolist does not bear the same relation to costs of production as in the case of unrestricted competition.86. The two main factors which it is necessary to take into consideration therefore, are the estimated cost of production in the Empire and the probable level of Kina bureau prices. No doubt any calculation of these two factors must be to some extent conjectural. On the one hand, due allowance must be made for the possibility that scientific research and the selection of new and more favourably situated areas for production may lead to a reduction in the cost of producing quinine in the Empire. Improvements also in marketing organisation may help to reduce the price at which Empire quinine can be sold. On the other hand, it may be difficult to predict what the policy of the Kina bureau will be if faced with new competition in the Empire market. This is, however, a matter of some importance since one of the possible advantages to be gained by increasing cinchona cultivation in the Empire is the likelihood that such a course, by threatening the position of the Kina bureau in that market may induce them to offer quinine at a lower price than before.87. In general, we consider that the possibility of securing a reduction in the price of quinine purchased from the Kina bureau by Empire countries is an important question which deserves examina-tion. It is a frequent ground of complaint that the Kina bureau is virtually a monopoly and dictates to the world the price at which it will sell quinine. It is, indeed, on these grounds that the produc-tion of quinine within the Empire is most often advocated. But such a course is not the only policy which can be adopted in order to undermine the power of a monopoly. Experience has shown that a frequent and natural sequel to a combination of producers is the formation of a combination of consumers. The existence, for example, of cartels or rings in the earlier stages of production leads to the growth of cartels in the later stages, the object of which is to restore the balance of bargaining power which has been disturbed.38. At the present time it appears that the imports of quinine purchased from the Kina bureau, either by Governments or by traders in Empire countries, are obtained quite independently, and individual Governments or firms have no great bargaining power in dealing with the bureau. If some organisation could be devised whereby the purchase of quinine for use in the Empire could be placed in the hands of a central purchasing authority, we think there is a possibility that this might enable a reduction to be secured in the price, particularly if the purchasing organisation were in a position to offer to take an increased quantity of quinine at the lower
price. We understand that in the past contracts have been arranged for the supply of cheap quinine between the Kina bureau and countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy and Russia. We suggest that the possibility of negotiating similar contracts for supplies of quinine for use in the Empire should be considered.39. Given the price at which the Kina bureau is prepared to sell quinine the other factor to be taken into account is the Empire cost of production. We feel that in forming a judgment of this factor due weight should be given to the possibility of lowering costs as a result of scientific research. No small part of the success of the Netherlands East Indies in cinchona cultivation has been due to the admirable work done in the research station at Sourabaya, where experiments in selection and hybridisation have resulted in very considerable increases in the alkaloid yield obtained. The history of the sugar and the indigo industries has furnished similar examples in the past of the substantial advantages which have been reaped by foreign producers through the proper utilisation of the results of scientific research. Cinchona cultivation is no doubt too speculative to justify large expenditure by private producers on scientific investigation. But a government quinine policy framed with reference to the interests of the Empire as a whole should exploit to the full the possibilities presented by a comprehensive programme of scientific research in this field.40. Another factor which may have an important influence on the cost of production is the type of drug which it is desired to produce. As we have mentioned in an earlier paragraph, the almost accidental preference which has been established for quinine has greatly reinforced the position of the Java producers owing to the high quinine content of C. ledgeriana, for which the climatic conditions of that area are particularly suited. We understand that in some areas in India G. ledgeriana grows well enough. But it seems likely that the possible area of cultivation would be greatly increased if C. succirubra or the hybrid sitccirubra + ofiicinalis, known as C. robusta, could be adopted. In order to make this possible, a much wider use of the other cinchona alkaloids, such as quinidinc or cinchonidine, or of the total alkaloids in the form known as Totaquina recommended by the Health Section of the League of Nations would be necessary. We consider that this aspect of the question, together with the need for a greater production of low-grade anti-malarial remedies such as cinchona febrifuge should receive careful consideration in the drawing up of a cinchona policy for the Empire.41. With these and other factors in mind it should be possible to arrive at a satisfactory estimate of the probable cost of production in the various territories of the Empire. Certain calculations have already been made at various times regarding production costs in India. In the Administrative Report of the Madras Government Cinchona Department for the year 1985-86, the factory cost of production of quinine was stated to have been Rs. 13-8-10 per lb. for 1985-36 as against the unusually low figure of Rs. 11-9-3 in the previous year. The Government selling price of quinine during the same period was Rs. 18., the market rate being Rs. 22. On these figures there appears to be ample justification for the cultivation of cinchona in the province in question. Again, in the report for the same year of the Government Cinchona Plantations and Factory in Bengal, the total cost of production per pound of quinine for the year in question was given as Rs. 6-548. With the Government selling rate at Rs. 18 per lb. the quinine extracted gave a profit of over 5^ lakhs. Here, too, there appears to be a generous margin between costs and prices. We are, however, uncertain whether the figures of costs quoted represent the complete cost calculated on a commercial basis. Somewhat similar estimates quoted in the report of the Indian Drugs Enquiry, 1981, were stated to make no provision for certain factors, notably interest on the capital employed, and the conclusion, therefore, reached (paragraphs 384 and 885) was that &quot; the cost^price of quinine in Madras, when all these factors are taken into considera-tion, is not far from the rates fixed by the Kina bureau,&quot; and &quot; the
notion (i.e., that the Cinchona Department of Bengal is a paying concern) will soon be dispelled if all the factors described above are accorded due consideration.&quot;42. It is important therefore that as accurate estimates as possible should be obtained regarding the minimum cost of production of quinine in the various parts of the Empire, ascertained on a true commercial basis. . Such estimates would presumably show some variation according to the amount of quinine which it was desired to produce. Cinchona cultivation, like other forms of agriculture, may be presumed to yield decreasing returns as the scale of production increases and less favourable areas are brought into cultivation.43. With adequate data covering the points outlined above, it would be possible to determine whether or not it would be advan-tageous to extend the scale on which cinchona cultivation is carried on in the Empire. It may, however, be objected that experience already provides an answer to this question in that at the present time it is already impossible for the Government of India to dispose of the whole of their existing output, and that stocks are being accumulated in spite of a reduction of the rate of exploitation of the plantations (see paragraph 21 above). Similarly, it may be said that progress is already being impeded in the cultivation of cinchona in parts of the Colonial Empire, such as Tanganyika, for lack of a sufficient market (see paragraph 26 above). As regards the latter point, we have not had before us any estimates of the cost of produc-tion of cinchona bark in those areas, such as the Usambara hills, which are considered suitable for cinchona cultivation. We note, however, that it is proposed to continue experimental tests in selected areas in Kenya and Uganda similar to those which have already been carried out in Tanganyika. The object of such experi-ments is to ascertain whether it would not be possible by State enterprise or under State enterprise, in co-operation with private persons under contract with State-controlled factories, to secure supplies of quinine from within the Colonial Empire itself at costs below those prevailing in the open market. We understand that hitherto the principal objection which has been urged against the establishment of State-owned plantations on a large scale is the restricted market which exists for quinine in the dependencies in East and West Africa, which is insufficient to absorb the output of a factory large enough to be economical. Provided, however, that the cost of production is not higher than in other parts of the Empire we see no reason why the object of quinine production in any part of the Empire should be restricted to the supply of the local market. The first essential, therefore, is to obtain some estimate of the probable cost of production in any area within the Empire such as the Usambara hills where it is proposed to develop cinchona cultivation.44. If estimates of the cost of production in Colonial territories could be obtained it might be found that these were higher than in other parts of the Empire such as India. In that event, the right policy would be for Colonial territories either to continue to buy from the Kina bureau, if this was the cheapest source of supply, or to obtain their quinine supplies from India, rather than to attempt to produce for themselves. This brings us to the objection raised above that cinchona cultivation has already been shown to be uneconomic in India in view of the difficulties experienced by State factories in disposing of their output and in avoiding the accumulation of stocks. We believe that a closer examination of the matter will show that these difficulties can be overcome and do not in themselves furnish evidence that quinine production in India will not be successful, provided that the problem of distribution can be satisfactorily solved.45. The annual consumption of quinine in India has been estimated by the Public Health Commissioner with the Government of India at 200,000 lbs., per annum. Of this approximately 110,000 lbs. is imported. Nevertheless, Government of India quinine sells at Rs. 18 per lb., whereas imported quinine costs Rs. 22. Moreover, as&apos;we have seen, the Government of India in its desire to reduce stocks was willing, to sell quinine at prices as low as Rs. 12
a lb. and eventually distributed a substantial amount free. It is difficult to reconcile these facts with a continuance of imports on a large scale and an absence of exports, together with an accumulation of stocks at home. The explanation appears to lie in two directions. In the first place, it is necessary to take into account differences of quality. Part of the output of the State factories in India is low grade quinine suitable for free distribution or for use in hospitals and charitable institutions. Quinine of this type cannot replace that part of imports represented by high grade quinine sold through chemists to the comparatively well-to-do. A second explanation may be that although Government quinine is offered at a lower price than Kina bureau quinine, it cannot for the most part be retailed through chemists owing to the fact that the latter are under contract with the Kina bureau not to sell quinine obtained from other sources. We should like to see fuller information obtained on these points as part of the inquiry which we propose below. On the evidence before us,&apos; it appears that a remedy could be found either, on the one hand, by establishing State retailing agencies, which could dispose of all State-produced quinine by under-selling the Kina bureau in the market, or, on the other hand, by inducing certain chemists to break away from their contract with the Kina bureau by guaranteeing them supplies sufficient to cover their requirements. This latter course would obviously be easier the more nearly the supply of Government quinine could be brought up to the level of the total consumption. As we have seen, this would involve a production of rather more than double the present quantity.Y. Recommendations for action.46. In the preceding Section of this report we have attempted to indicate the principal factors which must be taken into account in reviewing the question of quinine policy in the Empire. We suggest that these matters should now form the subject of a new and thorough inquiry. It will be evident that an inquiry of this scope can only be carried out in close co-operation with the Govern-ments concerned, namely, the Government of India, the Government of Burma and the Governments of the British Colonial Territories, all of whom are interested as consumers of quinine, while some are interested also as producers, either actual or potential.47. As a first step, therefore, we recommend that copies of this report should be communicated to each of the Governments referred to above with a request that they should prepare a full statement of their views on the matters discussed in it, including information regarding the present consumption of quinine within the Empire, the measures which might be taken for increasing consumption, and the best means of meeting Empire requirements for quinine, whether by setting up a central purchasing authority, to negotiate with the Kina bureau or by increasing production within the Empire, or by both these methods. We further recommend that in the light of the information thus obtained, His Majesty&apos;s Government should take steps to institute a full and careful inquiry into the matters discussed in this report, with the object of formulating a compre-hensive policy for the Empire as a whole on this question.48. In conclusion, we wish to acknowledge the assistance afforded to us by certain Departments and institutions who, at our request, furnished us with information on various aspects of the questions discussed in this report. These were: the Colonial Office, the India Office, the Ministry of Health, the Imperial Institute, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. In addition to the written state-ment prepared for us by the last-named organisation, Sir Arthur W. Hill, K.C.M.G., F.R.S., Director, Royal Botanic Gardens, accompanied by Mr. II. C. Sampson, C.I.E., Economic Botanist, Royal Botanic Gardens, attended one of our meetings at which this matter was discussed, and we are especially indebted to them for this assistance.[16002]d
VI. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.Conclusions.49.   We summarise our principal conclusions as follows: Anti-malarial therapy and quinine requirements.(1) Malaria is the most important of all diseases affecting the inhabitants of tropical and sub-tropical climates, and its geographical distribution is widespread. The number of persons suffering from malaria in India alone has been calculated at 100 millions. The mortality from malaria in India has been estimated at 500 per 100,000 of the population, or 1,130,000 deaths annually, but besides this annual death roll, the disease gravely impairs the health and efficiency of the many millions who suffer from it. Similar calculations have been made regarding the situation which exists in important areas of the Colonial Empire.   (Paragraphs 1 to 4.)(2) At its present price quinine is, in most cases, beyond the means of the Indian peasant or the African native, but price is not the only factor. An increase in the consumption of quinine will depend not only on the provision of supplies at low cost, but also on an extension of facilities for the distribution of the drug. Education and propaganda are also needed to convince the native of its efficacy and ensure that the treatment is properly applied. (Paragraph 5.)(3) The provision of anti-malarial drugs, together with the measures necessary to educate the native population in their use, should, we feel, be given an important place amongst the social services directed to the building up of national health and efficiency in the countries affected.   (Paragraph 6.)Production of quinine in the Empire.(4) Quinine is obtained from the bark of the cinchona, a tree originally found only in South America. Cinchona species were introduced into the British tropical possessions in about 1860, and twenty-five years later Ceylon had become, and for a time remained, the principal source of supply of the bark. Since that time, however, a striking change has occurred in the position, and to-day about 97 per cent, of the world&apos;s supply of cinchona is furnished by Java. The volcanic soils of the island have been found to be particularly suited to the growing of C. ledgeriana.   (Paragraphs 7 to 10.)(5) At the present time the world output, and hence the price of quinine, are virtually under the control of the Netherlands organisation which is known as the Kina bureau, and has its head-quarters at Amsterdam.   (Paragraph 11.)(6) The only considerable source of quinine within the Empire is in India. In 1916 the Government of India took steps to investi-gate the possibility of obtaining enough suitable land in India to produce cinchona bark to supply the whole requirements of India and the greater part of the needs of the Empire. These hopes, however, have not been realised, and at the present time India still imports more than half her annual consumption of quinine while her exports are negligible.   (Paragraphs 12 to 15.)(7) One of the principal problems which have arisen during recent years has been the accumulation of stocks of quinine in the hands of the Government of India.   (Paragraphs 16 to 21.)(8) Steps have been taken recently to initiate cinchona oultiva-tion in certain parts of the Colonial Empire, notably in Tanganyika, Cameroons and Malaya.   (Paragraphs 22 to 26.)The need for an Empire quinine policy.(9) No great success has been achieved during the last twenty years in extending the cultivation of cinchona in the Empire. We feel that if substantial progress is to be made a fresh attempt must
be made to formulate a definite policy in regard to quinine for the Empire as a whole.   (Paragraph 27.)(10) An important factor which has influenced the consideration of this question in the past has been the possibility of new discoveries in the development of synthetic remedies for malaria. In the light of more recent experience, however, it appears that drugs such as atebrin and the more recently discovered derivative, atebrin musonate, are unlikely to replace quinine during an epidemic or in mass treat-ment for the disease chiefly because their administration requires medical supervision in contrast to the quinine and cinchona prepara-tions, which are safely taken by the patients themselves. Plasmoquine has also proved to be too toxic for general use. Although there is still the possibility that better anti-malarial drugs will be synthesised in the future, we think it unlikely that the demand for quinine will be appreciably reduced. In this connection the question of synthesizing quinine itself should be considered. (Paragraphs 28 to 30.)(11) We can no longer regard it as justifiable to defer considera-tion of the problem of Empire quinine supplies on the grounds that cheaper and better synthetic substitutes may become available. In our view a time has come when it is urgently necessary that this important question should be examined and a concerted policy agreed upon for the Empire as a whole. We consider that for this purpose a special inquiry should be instituted with the co-operation of the Governments of India and of Burma and of the Colonial territories. (Paragraph 31.)(12) One of the most important points which requires considera-tion is whether any steps can &quot;be taken to increase the present consumption of quinine in the Empire.   (Paragraphs 32 and 33.)(13) Apart from considerations of security in time of war, we assume that the principal object in view is to obtain supplies of quinine for the Empire in the cheapest and most economical manner possible. It is from this standpoint that the question of further development of cinchona cultivation in the Empire deserves consideration.   (Paragraphs 34 to 36.)(14) Attention should also be given to the possibility of securing a reduction in the price of quinine purchased from the Kina bureau by Empire countries, if some organisation could be devised whereby the purchase of quinine for use in the Empire could be placed in the hands of a central purchasing authority, we think that there would be a possibility of negotiating a contract with the bureau for the supply of quinine in bulk at a reduced price.   (Paragraphs 37 to 38.)(15) A government quinine policy framed with reference to the interests of the Empire as a whole should exploit to the full the possibilities presented by a comprehensive programme of scientific research in this field. The methods adopted for the marketing of quinine produced in the Empire should also receive consideration. (Paragraph 39.)(16) The possibility of extending the cultivation of cinchona in the Empire would be greatly increased if a much wider use were made of cinchona alkaloids other than quinine, such as quinidine or cinohonidine or of the total alkaloids in the form known as Totaquina recommended by the Health Section of the League of Nations. We suggest that this aspect of the question, together with the need for a greater production of low-grade anti-malarial remedies such as cinchona febrifuge, should receive careful consideration. With these and other factors in mind it should be possible to arrive at a satis-factory estimate of the probable cost of production in the various territories of the Empire.   (Paragraphs 40 to 45.)(17) It will be evident that an inquiry of the scope indicated above can only be carried out in close co-operation with the Govern-ments concerned, namely, the Governments of India and of Burma and the Governments of the British Colonial territories, all of whom are interested as consumers of quinine, while some are interested also as producers either actual or potential.   (Paragraph 46.)
Recommendations. 50.   We recommend: (1) That in accordance with conclusion 17 above, copies of this report should be communicated to each of the Governments there referred to with a request that they should prepare a full statement of their views on the matters disoussed in it, including information regarding the present consumption of quinine within the Empire, the measures which might be taken for increasing consumption, and the best means of meeting Empire requirements for quinine whether by setting up a central purchasing authority to negotiate with the Kina bureau or by increasing production within the Empire or by both these methods.   (Paragraph 47.)(2) That in the light of the information obtained by the means suggested in recommendation (1) above, His Majesty&apos;s Government should institute a full and careful inquiry into the matters discussed in this report, with the object of formulating a comprehensive policy for the Empire as a whole on this question.
