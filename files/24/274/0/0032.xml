FOURTH REPORT.ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION.I.-THE   EXTENT   OP   ATMOSPHERIC   POLLUTION.We desire in this report to call attention to the waste and damage which are caused through the pollution of the atmosphere by smoke. This is a problem which, both on scientific and on wider and more general grounds,&apos; appears to us to be of great importance. As scientists, we regard it as an anachronism that in an age of great technical progress such as the present, we should continue to make use of coal by methods which to so large an extent are both primitive and wasteful. The Newton Committee reporting in 1921* estimated that approximately 2  million tons of potential fuel in the form of soot escaped annually into the atmosphere from domestic fire-places. In the case of industry where the methods of combustion adopted were more efficient, the loss of fuel was still considerable, being estimated at 500,000 tons.2. But this serious waste of fuel is not the only consequence of our present methods of using coal in the open fire. The imperfect combustion which takes place in the fire-place is responsible for the discharge of soot and smoke from the chimney, which do great damage both to the health of city populations, to vegetation and to buildings.8. Much careful study has been devoted in recent years to the task of measuring and recording the amount of smoke and soot discharged into the air of our great cities, the results of which are presented in the annual reports of the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution, published under the auspices of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The latest report issued covering the year ended the 31st March, 1936, shows how large are the quantities of soot deposited at the various recording stations all over the country. The lowest figure, that for Mearnskirk Hospital, Glasgow, showed a monthly average of total solids deposited of 309 metric tons per hundred square kilometres, or 7-88 English tons per square mile. The highest figure was recorded at Netherfield Road, Liverpool, where the monthly average deposit was 2,277 metric tons per hundred square kilometres, or 58-06 English tons per square mile. Between these two extremes there was of course considerable variation between one area and another, and often between two stations situated in the same area. Out of a total, however, of 97 stations making observa-tions, 81 showed a total deposit of from 500-1,500 metric tons per hundred square kilometres.4. The figures given in the preceding paragraph refer only to deposited impurity, that is, to the quantities of soot, &amp;c, which settle upon the ground. In addition to this, however, there is also a considerable amount of atmospheric impurity consisting of particles so small that they remain suspended in the air. It is this form of impurity which in certain meteorological conditions becomes so concentrated as to produce a thick smoke haze in the atmosphere, often accompanied by fog. Observations carried out at certain stations during the winter months 1935-1936, showed that thick smoke haze occurred in some cases on a high percentage of the total number of days observed. The highest figure was recorded at Stokf-on-Trent, where thick smoke haze occurred on 137 out of 180 days observed, or 76 per cent. Other stations at which the percentage was high were Victoria Street with 44 per cent., South Kensington with 37 per cent., and Westminster City Hall with 86 per cent.5. The smokes impurities which are discharged from coal fires consist to a large extent of carbonaceous matter, including a propor-tion of tar. Considerable quantities of sulphur, derived from coal, are also emitted, principally in the form of sulphur dioxide, other* Interim Report.   Cmd. 755.
sulphur-containing acids and sulphates, together with ash or grit, and steam. The sulphur dioxide given off combines with water in the atmosphere to form sulphurous acid, and to some extent and under certain conditions sulphuric acid. .These sulphur compounds, which are dispersed over wide areas, are an injurious constituent of the smoke discharged from industrial and domestic chimneys.II. THE  DAMAGE  CAUSED  BY  POLLUTION.6. The damage which is done by this heavy pollution of our atmosphere is of three principal kinds. In the first place, we have to consider the adverse effects which it exercises upon the health of those who live in thickly populated areas. It is difficult to obtain precise statistics which would illustrate these effects. The factors which determine the death rate, or even the death rate from a particular group of diseases, such as respiratory diseases, are so numerous and so diverse that an attempt to trace the influence of a single factor, such as atmospheric pollution, can hardly be expected to lead to conclusive results. One of the best known inquiries on this subject is that carried out in 1924 by W. T. Russell into the influence of fog upon respiratory diseases. Mr. Russell&apos;s conclusion was that if the prevalence of fog was associated with low temperature, and with frost, the respiratory death rate of adults would be affected very considerably, though this effect was not evident in the case of children. Apart from statistical evidence, however, we doubt whether it would seriously be questioned that smoke fog must inevitably tend to bring about an increased death rate, particularly from diseases of the lungs.7. Moreover, smoke pollution has a further effect upon general health by the reduction which it causes in the amount of ultra-violet light reaching the surface of the earth. It is true that in this country, even under the best conditions, the amount of ultra-violet irradiation arriving at the earth&apos;s surface is relatively small as compared, for instance, with that found in tropical countries. But small as it is, this irradiation may be of great value in promoting calcification of the bones and teeth in people, especially children upon whose skin it falls. Prom the evidence available, it seems clear that in and near the ordinary industrial town, under present conditions, the amount of ultra-violet light reaching the ground is still further diminished, and may at certain times and under certain conditions be reduced to zero. In these places, therefore, the power of sunshine to promote the proper formation of bones and teeth at any time of the year may be very seriously reduced, and this state of affairs is at least in part due to the smoke in the atmosphere.8. We may add to what has been said above regarding the effects of atmospheric pollution on health the following extract from the Annual Report for 1925 of the Chief Medical Officer, Ministry of Health : &quot; There is, indeed, a general concordance between exposure to atmospheric contamination and the existence of high mortalityfrom respiratory diseases which is impressive.....   We cannotprove in a logical or convincing way that climate or the pollution of the atmosphere with smoke, dust and other ingredients are directly murderous, but we know by experience that their presence is inimical to all forms of life, just as we know that sunlight and fresh clean air are favourable to vitality and resistance to infection. Every form of industrial or mechanical contrivance which either prevents or reduces pollution of the atmosphere is a contribution to the public health, and this aspect of the problem calls for the continued and vigilant atten-tion both of authorities and of those responsible for commercial concerns.&quot;9. Secondly, there can be no question of the serious damage caused to public and other buildings by the pollution of the atmosphere. The Newton Committee in their interim report published striking photographs showing the decay of stone-work in such buildings as Somerset House, the Houses of Parliament, the Tower of London and Chelsea Hospital, which must be held to be very largely the result of exposure to a smoke-laden atmosphere. The large quantities of sulphur compounds discharged into the air are washed down by the rain in the form of sulphates and acids which
attack stonework, particularly stones composed of limestone, and cause the surface to crumble and flake off. The damage inflicted ia not limited to the actual area of smoke-polluted cities. Wind carries smoke and sulphur pollution to great distances, and buildings such as Hampton Court Palace, Windsor Castle, Rievaulx Abbey, Tintern Abbey and many others are all endangered and disfigured by the corrosive action of a smoky atmosphere.10. We are informed that during the last four years over  2,000 has been expended on the external stonework of Somerset House in removing the encrustations caused by smoke pollution, renewing decayed banisters and cutting out iron dowels, &amp;c. It is probable that the complete restoration will cost from  15,000 to  20,000. The stone is Portland and the building is only 160 years old. On the other hand, the Portland stone in the ruins of Sandsfoot Castle, near Weymouth a fifteenth century building is in excellent condition and does not exhibit any signs of the decay visible at Somerset House in spite of its greater age.11. The late Sir Frank Baines, formerly Director of Works, His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works, in the report of the Conference on smoke abatement held at Manchester in 1924, estimated that from 80 to 40 per cent, of the cost of maintaining official buildings in the charge of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works could be saved if the air were as pure and clean in towns as it is in rural districts, and that this saving would amount to  120,000 a year. The same authority has stated that the cost of repairing the damage done by atmospheric pollution to buildings over the whole country could be placed at a minimum of  55,000,000 to  60,000,000 for a period of twenty-five years.12. The third principal form of damage attributable to the effects of atmospheric pollution is damage to vegetation. There is no doubt that much injury is caused to green plants through the pollution of the atmosphere by smoke. That this is so, is well attested by experiment and practical experience both in this and in other countries. Coniferous trees, in particular, are quickly injured by the deposition of soot on the leaves. The effects of London smoke on this type of tree are so damaging that it has been found necessary to remove the representative collection of conifers from Kew Gardens to a site provided by the Forestry Commission at Bedgebury near Tunbridge Wells. Various types of evergreen shrubs, fruits, vege-tables and grasses, are also susceptible to damage by smoke. The injury caused is mainly due to sulphur compounds. Seduction in light intensity is also an important factor.13. The chief losses in farming caused by smoke pollution are probably due more to chronic injury not easily recognisable than to acute cases with clearly defined symptoms. Instances have been observed, however, of smoke damage to crops in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1935, where wheat was the most seriously affected cereal, but most spring crops suffered severely during the cold wet spell in May of that year. An area of severe smoke pollution occurs also in the Hyde district in North-East Cheshire, where farms are surrounded on three sides by manufacturing towns such as Manchester, Stalybridge, Glossop and Stockport. The crops and stock on these farms suffer greatly from smoke damage. The injury caused by soot and smoke to plants grown under glass has also been the subject of special inquiry by the Royal Horticultural Society and more recently at Kew Gardens. These inquiries have shown that the injury is at times considerable.14. To the. three principal forms of damage caused by smoke pollution described above there may be added other examples of inconvenience-or loss attributable to this cause. Ample data exist showing the significant loss of daylight caused by pollution. For example, in a comparison of daylight received in two centres in Halifax during the year April 1981-Mai-ch 1982, it was found that the more heavily polluted jjentre received 20 per cent, less light than the other during the period in question. The loss was greater in the winter months, amounting in December 1981 to nearly 50 per cent. Smoke haze again often makes flying impossible at aerodromes such
III.-THE  PROSPECTS  OF  IMPROVEMENT.15. We have not attempted in this report to do more than present a few salient facts in regard to the extent of atmospheric pollution and the damage which it causes. Nevertheless, we feel that we have said enough to show the serious nature of the problem. We may now turn to a discussion of the tendencies making for some improvement of the position, whether through the development of methods for eliminating or reducing the emission of smoke from factory chimneys or through a more widely extended use of gas, electricity, or solid smokeless fuels for domestic purposes. It should be observed that it is the latter form of progress which is most urgently needed if any substantial improvement in the cleanliness of the atmosphere is to be secured. In their Interim Report, the Newton Committee suggested (paragraph 6) that the domestic chimney is responsible for at least half of the total of atmospheric pollution, and refer in support to the figures quoted in paragraph 1 above of the amount of potential fuel escaping from the domestic and industrial chimney respectively.* ThaCthis estimate of the degree of responsibility of the domestic chimney is conservative is shown by estimates made by Dr. J. S. Owens regarding the relative magnitude of domestic and industrial pollution in London and Glasgow. In London it appeared that on the average the ratio of domestic to industrial smoke was 2^ to 1, while in Glasgow it was 3i to 1. Moreover, domestic smoke is far more injurious owing to the high percentage of tarry matter which it contains.16: The emission of injurious substances from chimneys can be reduced almost to negligible proportions in large boiler plants by methods such as those which have been adopted at the Battersea power station and at the new Fulham power station. These methods have the advantage not only of preventing the emission of soot and grit, but also of reducing the sulphur emitted to negligible amounts. Even without the elaboration of such methods modern power stations should emit little smoke, as distinct from sulphur compounds and some dust and grit, since the boilers used can be designed and operated to give virtually complete combustion of the fuel.17. In all furnaces smoke can be reduced to a minimum by the observance of scientific principles in furnace design. One of the most frequent causes of smoke production is the use of boilers whose capacity is insufficient to, deal with heavy peak loads. Forcing the boilers leads to inefficient combustion and the production of an excessive quantity of smoke. Nevertheless, the waste of fuel which results may be less expensive than the installation of a larger or more up-to-date plant.18. In the case of the smaller industrial plants, the production of smoke can be largely avoided by burning smokeless coals such as anthracite or steam coal. It can also be greatly reduced by the use of suitable blends of coal. For example, a blend of Kent coal with Scottish anthracite which has been found to give excellent results, is being produced and sold in London at a plant opened in July 1934 by the then Minister for Mines, Mr. Ernest Brown. This develop-ment is due to His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works, by whom experiments on these lines have been carried out with great success in the steam-raising plants for which they are responsible. The blending of coal in this manner can only be undertaken by large merchants or individual consumers. It cannot be carried out at the collieries in view of the fact that the different varieties of coal required are seldom* As the Newton Committee pointod out, these figures taken by themselves would suggest that the domestic chimney is responsible for as much as five-sixths of the total amount of smoke discharged into tho atmosphore.as Catterick, near Leeds, which are in proximity to large industrial centres. Finally, it is the common experience of all who live in large towns that the cost of household washing and of repairs and replace-ment of metal work, textile fabrics, &amp;c, is greatly increased by the impurity of the atmosphere.
Bif ever produced at one and the same colliery, and very often not even in the same district or coal-field. Further developments in these methods of blending may be expected as a wider knowledge of our national coal resources is gained, and for this purpose the work of the coal survey which is being carried out by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research will be of special value.19. Another factor which will assist in reducing the extent of atmospheric pollution is the increasing substitution of electricity, gas and coke for the burning of raw coal. The following table shows that during the past few years the consumption of electricity has substantially increased.Table 1. Consumption of Electricity.Year.1925-26 1980-31 1931-82 1932-33 1933-34 1984-85Similarly, in the following table the consumption of gas and the number of consumers shows some increase, though this has been less marked in the later years.Table 2. Gas sold by authorised undertakings.Year. Million cubic feet.   Number of Consumers.1925 ...... 265,757 8,200,4551930 ...... 289,991 9,848,8341931 ...... 290,693 9,558,2291932 ...... 286,988 9,778,0151933 ...... 286,144 10,012,8791934 ...... 290,644 10,277,010Of the quantities of gas sold, the industrial consumption is-estimated at about 15 per cent, on the average. In certain areas, the industrial consumption is very much greater. For example, in Sheffield and Stretford the proportion is as high as 60 per cent., and in Birmingham 80 per cent. In the manufacture of coal gas small amounts of smoke may be produced in certain types of retorts, and this is also true in the case of coke ovens. Coke oven plants are, however, often situated in comparatively isolated areas, so that the smoke is likely to be dispersed through the atmosphere before a thick haze has had time to form. When used as a fuel, gas is entirely smokeless, while the amount of sulphur which it contains is very low. A wider use of gas for industrial purposes is, of course, closely dependent upon its price. In those districts such as South Yorkshire, where coke-oven gas is available at a low price, the demand has recently been showing a considerable expansion.20. Whatever progress may be made in reducing the amount of smoke discharged into the air by factory chimneys, it is to the domestic grate that we must turn if we wish to find the source of the greater part of the impurity in our atmosphere. In spite of improve-ments in the designs of grates, the open fire burning ordinary household coal must&apos; always produce smoke, especially during the lighting-up period and whenever fuel is added to the fire. The alternatives to coaFfor domestic purposes consist on the one hand of gas and electricity * and on the other hand of solid smokeless fuels such as anthracite, gas coke, or coke produced by low tempera-ture carbonisation. Appliances are nowadays available which enable gas or electricity to be used-for all domestic purposes. As compared with coal, either of these methods is expensive when used for heating large quantities of water or for continuous domestic heating. The cost of gas, however, and to some extent of electricity, compares moreTotal units sold to consumers.Millions.5,6069,0789,501 10,210 11,467 13,030Total units sold for lighting, heat-ing and cooking.Millions. 1,244 2,744 3,072 8,469 3,916 4,535J-UL.ll     UIllLBsold for traction power and public lighting.Millions.4,8626,8296,4296,7417,5518,495
favourably with that of coal both for cooking and also for intermittent heating, since a coal fire takes some time to develop its full heat and cannot be quickly extinguished as can a gas stove. At present prices the most economical method of obtaining constant supplies of hot water is by the use of boilers burning coke. These can also be used very cheaply for central heating by means of radiators. Where, however, central installations are provided, as, for example, in blocks of flats, the total cost may be higher owing to the tendency on the part of the individual consumer to be extravagant in the use of heat.21. The solid smokeless fuels which can be burnt in grates are of various kinds. They include anthracite, smokeless steam coals, ordinary gas coke, and coke produced by the different processes of low temperature carbonisation. All of these give excellent fires in suitable grates or stoves. In addition to fuels of this kind, which are smokeless, suitable mixtures of &quot; high volatile &quot; and &quot; low volatile &quot; (smokeless) coals are available which produce less smoke than the normal high volatile household coals. These blends are satisfactory in many types of grate, but are slightly less free burning than the coals ordinarily in use. The necessary blending can only be carried out with coals of a suitable size and, like the industrial blends referred to in paragraph 18 above, they can only be prepared by the distributor. The use of solid smokeless fuels does not, of course, by itself eliminate pollution of the atmosphere by sulphur.22. Generally speaking, the higher the percentage of volatile matter contained in a coke, the more free burning it is. A number of gas works and coke ovens are now producing cokes which are more free burning than ordinary coke, and grates are available which give excellent results with these fuels. The difficulty of lighting is over-come by the use of gas jets to ignite the fuel. The number of such grates in use is increasing. For example, by 1938, 69,000 &quot; Metro &quot; grates had been installed, and the annual rate of installation is said to be at least 14,000 in London alone. Coke and anthracite are being used to an increasing extent in domestic boilers.23. The semi-coke obtained by the low temperature carbonisation -tion of coal provides a very satisfactory fuel for the open fire. The industry, has made steady progress in the last few years. The production since 1931 has been as follows: Table 3. Production of low temperature coke.Year. Tons.1931 ............ 151,7291932 ............ 162,7971933 ......      ...... 222,2451934 ............ 220,7981985 ............ 260,358Additional plants are under erection, and an appreciable increase on the figure for 1985 can soon be expected. Low temperature cokes are produced by the carbonisation of coal in retorts at a temperature of about 600o C, compared with a normal temperature employed in the production of gas coke of from 1,100&quot; C. to 1,800&quot; C. The products obtained from the low temperature process differ somewhat according to the type of retort used. In each ease about 14 cwt. of low temperature coke and 16-20 gallons of tar are obtained per ton of coal treated. Where the retorts used are heated externally, a relatively small volume of rich gas is also produced. With internally-heated retorts a larger volume of gas is obtained having a lower calorific value. It will be evident that in order to make the process commer-cially profitable, the price obtained for these three products must together be sufficient to meet the cost of the coal used and also the capital and working expenses of the plant. Anything therefore which tends to extend the market for the gas and tar obtained will assist the pi-oduction and utilisation of low temperature coke as a smokeless fuel. The price of oil (which is obtainable from low temperature tar) is in large measure subject to the influence of the oil companies which hold a controlling position in the market. But [16381] c
the recent introduction of a guaranteed preference* on home-produced motor spirit and the imposition of a dutyt on imported heavy oils will undoubtedly prove favourable to the increased use of low temperature coke. Such an increased use would be of value also in promoting the aim of reducing the dependence of this country on external supplies of motor spirit and oil. The development of hydrogenation will also have a similar effect in raising the value of the by-products obtained in low temperature carbonisation, since low temperature tar submits readily to hydrogenation without predistillation.24. At the present time low temperature coke is retailed at round about 58s. per ton as compared with best household coal, which costs from 45s. to 50s. The radiant efficiency of a coke fire is, however, considerably greater than that of a coal fire, and from 15 to 20 per cent, less weight of coke is required for open fires as compared with coal. It will be seen therefore that at present prices low temperature coke should be as economical in use as coal for burning in an open grate. Developments in technique due to research at the Fuel Research Station and elsewhere may be expected to bring about further reduction in the future in the costs of production. In particular, production on a large scale would lower costs, especially as regards the handling of the material.25. A disadvantage which attaches to coke in comparison with coal is that its bulk density is only from one half to two thirds as grest. In other words, a given weight of coke requires as much as twice the space taken up by an equal weight of coal. This is only partly compensated for by the greater radiant efficiency of coke. It follows that for the production of a given quantity of heat, a coke fire requires more frequent making up. Greater space is also required for storage, and this may be of importance in cases where space is limited as in many modern dwellings. The low bulk density of coke may also in some circumstances result in higher transport charges. Coke is, however, more easily handled in the household.26. A possible disadvantage which applies to smokeless fuels whether solid or gaseous is that the carbon monoxide produced by incomplete combustion may be discharged into the room unobserved, as a result of a down draught in the flue. With coal, the smoke, produced provides a danger signal, and windows are opened to increase ventilation. In the absence of smoke the danger may be overlooked, though the products of combustion should be readily detected by smell.27. These disadvantages would probably not be sufficient in themselves to prevent the adoption of smokeless methods of heating on a much wider scale. A more serious obstacle is the prejudice which at present exists in the public mind in favour of the old-fashioned coal fire. The quantity of coal burnt for domestic purposes is of course so great that it cannot be expected to be replaced by other methods of heating within a short period. But the continued progress of the gas and electricity industries and the development of low temperature carbonisation are all of them factors making for a gradual and much needed improvement in the present position.28. Nevertheless, we do not feel that these influences will of themselves prove sufficient to bring about a satisfactory solution of the problem. We feel that there is a case to-day for some more vigorous action to deal with the admitted evils of the smoke nuisance. At the stage to which we have -so far- carried our inquiry, we do not yet feel able to formulate definite proposals for remedial action. We hope to do this in a later report&apos;on this subject. At the present stage, however, we feel that our chief need is for fuller information regarding the possibilities of securing a more widespread adoption of the smokeless methods pfheating described above, and the problems of production and distribution which this would involve.   At the same* A preference has been guaranteed of id. a gallon for a period of nine years from 1st April, 1935, or of an equivalent total amount for a shorter period, on motor spirit produced from indigenous materials.t Imported heavy oils used for road transport purposes are subject to a duty of 8d. per gallon and those used for other purposes to a duty of Id. per gallon. As heavy oils produced from indigenous materials are not subject to taxation, they enjoy a preference equal to the amount of the duty on the imported oils.
time we do not feel that as a Committee we are in a position to undertake the detailed study of the problem which such an investiga-fion would require.29. Our first recommendation is therefore that the Economic Advisory Council should invite the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to prepare for our assistance a memorandum on the technical possibilities of securing an increased use of smokeless methods of heating, including a review of the technical problems both of production and of distribution involved. When this is avail-able other Departments of State might be invited to amplify it by submitting comments on those aspects of the problem with which they are specially concerned. We do not consider it necessary to lay down in precise terms the scope of this inquiry. We suggest, however, that the memorandum in question should be prepared under the general supervision of our Chairman, acting in consultation with Lord Cadman and Sir Frank Smith, two of our mernber-s who have expressed their willingness to assist us in this manner.30. By these means we hope to obtain fuller data than are at present before us regarding the technical and economic possibilities of a wider use of smokeless methods of heating. In the meantime, however, there is one immediate contribution which might, in our opinion, be made towards the solution of the problem of atmospheric pollution. The offices of public departments are important users of fuel for heating purposes, and the methods of heating employed in them must have a substantial effect upon the state of the atmosphere over a considerable area. If smokeless methods of heating were to be adopted in these offices, such a step would, in our opinion, be of great value on several grounds. Not only would the amount of smoke in the air of Westminster and elsewhere be diminished, but useful data would be obtained regarding the advantages and disadvan-tanges arising from the use of the various smokeless methods of heating in practice. Moreover, if suitable publicity were given to such a decision it would, we feel, have a valuable effect in drawing public attention to this question, and in setting an example to other large users of fuel.31. We recommend, therefore, that the Economic Advisory Council - should represent to the First Commissioner of Works the advantages which would be secured by the adoption of one or other of the various smokeless methods of heating in the offices of all public departments and other buildings under his control.32. In conclusion we wish to acknowledge the assistance afforded to us by certain Departments who, at our request, furnished us with information on various aspects of the question of atmospheric pollution. These were: the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry of Health, H.M. Office of Works, the Mines Department, the Department of Health for Scotland, and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland.IY.-SUMMARY   OF   PRINCIPAL   CONCLUSIONS   AND RECOMMENDATIONS.(a) Principal Conclusions.33.   We summarise our conclusions as follows: The extent of atmospheric pollution.(1) Pollution of the atmosphere by smoke is a problem which, both on scientific and on wider and more general grounds, appears to us to be of great importance. We regard it as an anachronism that in an age of great technical progress such as the present, we should continue to make use of coal by methods which to so large an extent are both primitive and wasteful. It has been estimated that 3 million tons of potential fuel in the form of soot escape annually into the atmosphere from domestic and industrial chimneys (paragraphs 1-8).[1C381] d
The damage caused by pollution.(2) The heavy pollution of our atmosphere is responsible for serious damage both to the health of city populations, to vegetation, and to buildings. As regards the first of these, there is evidence that smoke fog tends to bring about an Increased death rate, particularly from diseases of the lungs. Moreover, smoke pollution has a further effect upon general health by the reduction which it causes in the amount of ultra violet light reaching the surface of the earth (paragraphs 6-8).(3) Serious damage is also caused to public and other buildings as a result of the sulphur compounds discharged into the atmosphere. The damage inflicted is not limited $o the actual area of smoke-polluted cities (paragraphs 9-11).(4) Vegetation is also seriously affected by smoke pollution. The damage done includes much injury to green plants. Coniferous trees, in particular, are quickly injured by the deposition of soot on the leaves. Various types of evergreen shrubs, fruits, vegetables and grasses are also susceptible to damage by smoke. Instances have been observed of smoke damage to crops and stock on farms situated in the neighbourhood of manufacturing towns. Injury is also caused by soot and smoke to plants grown under glass (paragraphs 12-13).(s) Other examples of damage or loss attributable to smoke pollution include loss of daylight, loss of flying time at aerodromes which are in proximity to large industrial centres, and the increased cost of household washing and of repairs and replacement of metal work, textile fabrics, &amp;c, due to the impurity of the atmosphere (paragraph 15.).The prospects of improvement.(6) Domestic and industrial chimneys both play a part in the pollution of the atmosphere, but evidence suggests that of these two sources the domestic chimney is the more important. Nevertheless, the reduction of smoke emission from factory chimneys has so far proved the easier problem (paragraph 15).(7) The emission of injurious substances from chimneys can be reduced almost to negligible proportions in large boiler plants by methods such as those which have been adopted at the Battersea power station and at the new Fulham power station. In all furnaces smoke can be reduced to a minimum by the observance of scientific principles in furnace design. In the case of the smaller industrial plants, the production of smoke can be largely avoided by burning smokeless coals such as anthracite or steam coal. It can also be greatly reduced by the use of suitable blends of coal (paragraphs 16-18).(8) Another factor which will assist in reducing the extent of atmospheric pollution is the increasing substitution of electricity, gas and coke for the burning of raw coal (paragraph 19).(9) The domestic grate, however, is the source of the greater part of the impurity in our atmosphere. In spite of improvements in the design of grates, the open fire burning ordinary household coal must always produce smoke, especially during the lighting-up period and whenever fuel is added to the fire. The alternatives to coal for domestic purposes consist, on the one hand, of gas and electricity, and, on the other hand, of solid smokeless fuels such as anthracite, smoke-less steam coals, gas coke and coke produced by the different processes of low temperature carbonisation (paragraphs 20-22).(10) The recent introduction of a guaranteed preference on home-produced motor spirit and the imposition of a duty on imported heavy oils will undoubtedly prove -favourable to the inoreased use of low temperature coke. Even at present prices low temperature ooke should be as economical in&apos; use as coal for burning in an open grate. Against this, however, must be set certain disadvantages attaching to its use (paragraphs 23-26).(11) We feel that there is a case to-day for some more vigorous action to deal with the admitted evils of the smoke nuisance.  We are
anxious to obtain fuller information regarding the possibilities of securing a more widespread adoption of smokeless methods of heating (paragraphs 27-29).(12) There is one immediate contribution which might, in our opinion, be made towards the solution of the problem of atmospheric pollution. If smokeless methods of heating were to be adopted in the offices of all public departments, such a step would be of great value on several grounds (paragraphs 30-31).(b) Recommendations.34.   We summarise our recommendations as follows: (1) In order to give effect to conclusion (11) above, we recommend that the Economic Advisory Council should invite the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to prepare a memorandum on the technical possibilities of securing an increased use of smokeless methods of heating, including a review of the technical problems both of production and distribution involved. When this is available, other Departments of State might be invited to amplify it by submitting comments on those aspects of the problem with which they are specially concerned. We suggest that the memorandum in question should be prepared under the general supervision of our Chairman, acting in consultation with Lord Cadman and Sir Frank Smith, two of our members who have expressed their willingness to assist us in this manner (paragraph 29).(2) We recommend that the Economic Advisory Council should represent to the First Commissioner of Works the advantages which would be secured by the adoption of one or other of the various smoke-less methods of heating in the offices of all Public Departments and other buildings under his control (paragraph 31).(Signed on behalf of the committee):A.
