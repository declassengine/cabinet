Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1938.SECRET. Copy No.139^-B.(Also Paper No. CCS. 680.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.STAFF CONVERSATIONS WITH PRANCE AND BELGIUM. (Previous OLD. Paper No. 1224-B.)Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.IN accordance with a request by the Foreign Office, we have had under consideration two letters, dated, the 16th December, 1937, and the 1st January, 1938, respectively, from the Foreign Office, in which we are asked for our observations on certain proposals for the resumption of staff conversations with France and Belgium (Annexes I and II).2. We do not feel it necessary to recapitulate, at any length, all our previous observations and views on this subject, of which the Foreign Office are, doubtless, fully aware. For example, it will be recalled that, in September 1936, when considering staff conversations in connection with the preparations for the proposed Five-Power Conference (Paper No. C.O.S. 511),* we reached the following conclusions : &apos;&apos; Apart from the practical difficulties, staff conversations would inevitably tend to involve us in military commitments, which would fetter our freedom of action as to the form our intervention might take when the occasion arose.Our conclusion, therefore, is that no provision should be made for staff -.   conversations with any Power.&quot;3. Again, when discussing the position of Belgium in the proposed Five-Power Conference (Paper No. COS. 528)t we stated : &quot; We would reiterate that nothing should be done, in our opinion, to encourage the idea that there is the possibility of staff conversations between us and either the French or Belgians, or both, for reasons which we have already fully stated in previous reports.&quot;4. From the foregoing it will be seen that we have consistently regarded staff conversations with misgivings. The very term &apos;&apos; staff conversations&apos;&apos; has a sinister purport, and gives an impression to interested countries, outside the conversation circle, of mutually assumed military collaboration by those partaking which must inevitably lead to mutual military commitments.5. There is another important aspect of this question. Hitherto it has been accepted that in any future European war in which we were ranged on the side of France, one of the first measures to be taken would be the despatch of a Field Force to the Continent. Even under the conditions shown above, when the despatch of this force remained part of our military policy in the event of* Also C.I.D. Paper No. 1260-B. [16613]f Also C.I.D. Paper No. 1287-B.b
war, we were opposed to staff conversations with the French. The recent Cabinet* decision on the role of the British Army, has, however, altered the situation of the army&apos;s war commitments, and the despatch of a Field Force to the Continent now takes a relatively low priority. As far as the army is concerned, therefore, we feel that at the present time it would be more appropriate frankly to inform the French of the new situation, rather than to contemplate re-opening staff conversations upon which we, for our part, could only embark empty-handed.6. On the other hand, as foreshadowed in paragraph 12 of the Foreign Office letter of the 16th December, one result of the recent decision on policy regarding the despatch of the Field Force to the Continent, will be to enhance the importance of effective co-operation with the French in the air in the event of attack by Germany. The Air Staff have been pressed by the French Air Staff, at intervals throughout last year, through the medium of the Air Attache in Paris, for an exchange of views on the combined action of the French and British air forces, which would go far beyond the scope of any exchange of information within the limits at present authorised. The French have submitted to the Air Ministry a memorandum on the initial employment of the French Air Force in a hypothetical war with Germany; and they have emphasised the importance of co-ordinating the action of the two Air Forces in advance since, if left until war breaks out, it may well be too late.7. In commenting on the French Memorandum, the Air Staff were non-committal; but, from the purely military point of view, the French attitude is admittedly logical. Moreover, in the event of war against Germany during the next few years, until the re-equipment of our Air Force with longer-range aircraft has been completed, part of our plans would be to despatch a certain portion of , our Air Striking Force to operate from French aerodromes. In order effectively to meet this eventuality, collaboration with the French as to aerodrome areas, supplies of fuel, transportation facilities, as well as the allocation of targets, would, from the purely military point of view, be desirable.8. In spite of the foregoing considerations which, from the purely military point of view, indicate the desirability of close collaboration with the French to meet the contingency of aggression by Germany, we do not advocate that discussions on the air questions referred to in paragraph 7 above, should be authorised. We feel certain that the opportunity of turning such conversations to their own political advantage would be seized upon by the French with avidity. The temptation to arrange a leakage of the information that such collaboration was taking, or had taken place would, in our opinion, prove irresistible to them in order to flaunt an Anglo-French accord in the face of Germany.9. Apart from the deplorable effect of such a leakage upon our present efforts to reach a detente with Germany, it is most important, from the military standpoint, that at the present time we should not appear to have both feet in the French Camp.10. We consider, therefore, that the military advantages of closer collaboration with the French regarding concerted measures against Germany; however logical they may appear, would be outweighed by the grave risk of precipitating the very situation which we wish to avoid, namely, the irreconcilable suspicion and hostility of Germany.11. There are, however, certain contacts with the French which could, we think, be usefully pursued without in any way disturbing our relations with Germany, and which would, at the same time, go some way to satisfy the apprehensions expressed by M. Corbin, referred to in the Foreign Office despatch dated the 17th December, 1937. t12. General Milch and other German Air Staff Officers have recently visited this country and have inspected certain air force stations as well as having informal discussions &quot;with officers of the Royal Air Force, and it would be a natural act for us to extend a similar invitation to officers of the French Air Force.Cabinet 49 (37). \ Enclosure to Annex II.
We are, of course, a I liberty at any time to exchange any information we may wish through the medium of our Service attaches without giving grounds for complaint, within the limits imposed by the instructions set out in OLD. 276th Meeting, Minute 1.13. With regard to industrial and armament-matters, and particularly in respect of aircraft equipment, it is a common practice for members of our firms to visit similar business concerns in Germany and vice versa. It is in fact to some extent by this means that we gain our knowledge of Germany&apos;s capacity for aircraft and engine production and can gauge to some extent the future trend of their design.14. Quite recently the officer responsible for the development of engine design in the Air Ministry visited Germany and obtained information of considerable value regarding their methods. There can surely be no reason, therefore, why officers holding equally responsible positions in France and Belgium should not come to this country for advice and obtain all the information they require without such visits being vested with the political importance of &quot; Staff Conversations.&apos;&apos;15. It therefore seems to us that many of the mutual requirements of France, Belgium and Great Britain, as at present stated, could to a great extent be met by the ordinary procedure of an exchange of visits which is open to all countries in time of peace, and we recommend that this method, combined with the normal means of interchange of information provided by the Service Attaches of the Powers concerned should be employed.16. We now turn to the point referred to in the Foreign Office letter dated the 1st January, 1938,* wherein the French Ambassador has suggested that, in view of the tense situation in the Far East, naval staff conversations with the French Government should be embarked upon. We agree that, in the event of our fleet being despatched to the Far East, and with the problem of an improved understanding with Germany still unresolved, we should need the co-operation of the French fleet to assist in the protection of sea communications in the Mediterranean, Atlantic and Home areas. We do not, however, consider that immediate Staff Conversations are necessary to secure this co-operation. At the same time it was found during the Italo-Abyssinian crisis that the redistribution of the French Fleet on any considerable scale is a process which takes far longer than it does in the case of our own. If, therefore, the despatch of our own Fleet to the Far East was seriously contemplated, it would be necessary to inform the French of our requirements as regards the co-operation of their Fleet at once.17. There remains the question of whether we should arrange for joint action with the French in the Mediterranean area; and it will be recalled that this was discussed at the 307th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence (Minute 5). In the event of war against Italy, a French threat to Libya from Tunisia would obviously reduce the scale of Italian attack on Egypt. We should also be seriously handicapped without the use of the French naval docks and repair facilities at Toulon and Bizerta. We do not, however, consider that conversations at the present time with the French on the above points should be entertained. Even without French co-operation and base facilities, we should have no doubt in our own minds as to the final outcome of a unilateral war between the United Kingdom and Italy. It is possible, in our view, that in such a war the French might stand aside, and in that event that Germany also might not become engaged. If, on the other hand, France were in alliance with us against Italy, Germany would be almost certain to come in against us, with the consequent risk of a world conflagration, the outcome of which we should view with much less confidence. We are, therefore, opposed to any approach to the French at the present time regarding the situation in the Mediterranean.18. We note that the Foreign Office, in paragraph 10 of their letter, dated the 16th December, referred to M. Spaak&apos;s conversation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 18th November, 1937, and suggest that his offer should not be left without response.    But, as pointed out in paragraph 25 of[16613]* Annex II.
Annex 1* to the above letter, our attaches in Brussels are already being supplied with the fullest information and we are, therefore, not clear that there is anything to be gained by any other method of collaboration with the Belgians.Furthermore, with reference to paragraph 13 of the Foreign Office letter, we understand that the Supply Board are at present examining a request from the Belgians that we should supply them with large quantities of aircraft and other warlike stores in war. The Air Staff have already considered making use of the opportunity, when the Supply Board have completed their investigations, to proffer advice through the Air Attache on the subject of the present rather unsatisfactory organisation of the Belgian air force, with a view to persuading them to effect certain changes which would render their air force more indepen-dent of immediate assistance from us in war. This, we suggest, is an example of the sort of liaison which can be conducted without recourse to anything in the shape of Staff conversations.Conclusions.19. We reach the following conclusions with regard to the Foreign Office proposals for Staff conversations with France : (a) We are opposed in principle to the suggestion in paragraph 17 (i) that&quot; conversations between the British and French General Staffs, military, naval and air, should be permitted on a generous interpre-tation of the definition given in paragraph III of the Text of Proposals of the 19th March, 1936 . . . .&quot; for the reasons given in paragraphs 5, 8 and 9 above.(b) We see no objection to the proposal in paragraph 17 (ii) that &quot; informa-tion should continue to be transmitted through the channel of the military, naval and air attaches . . . .&quot;(c) If our views expressed in (a) above and in the body of this memorandum are upheld, the question of an announcement to the French Govern-ment and to the public referred to in paragraph 17 (iii) and (iv) respectively, would not arise.(d) As regards Belgium, we recommend that no extension of the existingcontacts between the two Staffs should be made.(e) As regards joint dispositions to meet the present disturbed situation inthe Far East, we do not recommend any immediate approach to the French. If, however, a decision were taken to despatch our own Fleet to the Far East, it would be necessary to inform the French of our requirements as regards the co-operation of their Fleet at once. (/) As regards joint dispositions to meet the Italian threat in the Mediter-ranean area, we agree that an assurance of French co-operation would be valuable. On the other hand, such co-operation would almost inevitably lead to Germany joining Italy in the struggle. On balance, therefore, we are against any approach to the French at the present time regarding the situation in the Mediterranean.(Signed) CHATFIELD.C. L. NEWALL. GORT.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.

ANNEX I.Copy of a letter dated December 16, 1937, from the Foreign Office to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.[C7843/G] Sir,I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to say that he has had under consideration the question of the contacts which have been maintained in the past between the British Naval, Military and Air Staffs on the one hand, and the French and Belgian General Staffs on the other. He has reached certain tentative conclusions as to the manner in which those contacts might be maintained in the future. He would be glad if his conclusions, and the arguments which lead up to them, could be submitted to the Chiefs of Staff for their consideration and advice. The history of these Staff contacts, so far as it is known to the Foreign Office, has been set down for convenience in a memorandum, a copy of which is enclosed.*&apos;2. It will be recalled that in Section III of the Text of Proposals drawn up at London on the 19th March, 1936, after the repudiation of the Locarno Treaty and the reoccupation of the Rhineland by Germany, the representatives of Great Britain, Belgium and France declared, so far as they were concerned, &quot; that nothing that has happened before or since the said breaches of the Treaty of Locarno can be considered as having freed the signatories of that Treaty from any of their obligations or guarantees, and that the latter subsist in their entirety.&quot; They further undertook &quot; forthwith to instruct their General Staffs to enter into contact with a view to arranging the technical conditions in which the obligations which are binding upon them shall be carried out in the case of unprovoked aggression.&quot;   (Cmd. 5134 of 1936.)3. In identical notes transmitted to the French and Belgian Ambassadors on the 1st April, 1936, His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook, among other things, that if the effort of conciliation, attempted in the arrangement of the 19th March, 1936, should fail, they would, in return for reciprocal assurances from France/ Belgium (i) Take, in consultation with the French/Belgian Government, all practical measures available to them for the purpose of ensuring &quot;the security of France/Belgium against unprovoked aggression; and(ii) For this purpose establish or continue the contact between the General Staffs of Great Britain and France/Belgium contemplated in Section III of the Text of Proposals.   (Cmd. 5149 of 1936.)4. In notes addressed to the French and Belgian Ambassadors, covering the notes mentioned in the preceding paragraph, His Majesty&apos;s Government stated that they were willing to instruct their General Staffs forthwith to enter into contact with the French/Belgian General Staffs, adding that it was under-stood that this contact could not &quot; give rise in respect of either Government to any political undertaking nor to any obligation regarding the organisation of national defence.&quot; The French and Belgian Governments, in their replies of the same date, confirmed that the proposed Staff conversations would be conducted on this understanding. (Cmd. 5149 of 1936.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had already described in similar terms in the House of Commons on the 26th March, 1936, the limitations which were to be placed upon the Staff conversations contemplated in Section III of the Text of Proposals.5. When, in April 1936 these Staff conversations took place, their scope was narrowly restricted. The Naval Staff conversations were limited to an exchange of opinion with regard to ports and the state of forces now in commission, and to certain questions with regard to communications, liaison officers, and signal codes. The Military Staff conversations were limited to a statement of the British forces available and a request to the French military representatives for* Annex I to Enclosure in Papers Nos. C.O.S. 658 and J.P. 255.[16613] b 3
information as to facilities at ports, transport from ports to assembly areas, and assembly areas. In addition, air protection in the port and assembly areas was discussed. It was agreed that the questions raised should be examined in the War Ministries concerned, and the information transmitted through the Military Attaches. In the course of the Air Staff conversations, strengths of the respective forces and the availability of aerodromes were fully discussed, questions concerning technical detail being remitted for further examination by the Service Attaches.6. On the 18th April, 1936, a communique was issued to the press stating simply that the conversations &quot; have been carried on with the greatest cordiality in the framework decided upon for the representatives of the different Staffs by their respective Governments. All other necessary information will be transmitted through the channel of the Military, Naval and Air Attaches.&quot;7. The reason, apart from parliamentary considerations, why the scope of these Staff conversations was limited and this was done at the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government was that it was hoped to negotiate a Treaty of mutual guarantee between the five Locarno Powers on the model of the former Locarno Treaty, and that in view of the German objection to the holding of these conversations, a too great extension of their scope would have made the negotiation of a new Treaty much more difficult, if not impossible. This consideration can hardly now be held to apply, for the prospect of concluding a new Western guarantee pact on the lines previously contemplated is at present very remote.8. In these circumstances, it would be possible to argue that the &quot;effort of conciliation&quot; attempted in the Text of Proposals of the 19th March, 1936, had failed and that His Majesty&apos;s Government could be called upon to give full effect to the various undertakings given by them to Prance and Belgium in their notes to the French and Belgian Ambassadors of the 1st April, mentioned in para-graph 3 above. It does not, however, seem likely that either the Belgian or French Government will now appeal to these notes. So far as the British guarantees to Belgium and France are concerned, neither the Belgian nor the French Govern-ment have made any intimation that they are dissatisfied with the present position, which is that Great Britain continues to be bound by the guarantees she gave to Belgium and France in the Locarno Treaty, as formally reaffirmed in the Text of Proposals of March 1936, and as recalled in the speech made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at Leamington on the 20th November, 1936.9. That being so, the position as regards Staff conversations is still governed by Section III of the Text of Proposals, and by the exchange of notes of the 1st April quoted above in paragraphs 2 and 4 respectively. It remains to examine the present attitude of the Belgian and French Governments on this question.10. The point of view of the Belgian Government in regard to Staff conversations was clearly stated in a speech by the Belgian Foreign Minister in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives on the 29th April. 1937, after the receipt of the Anglo-French declaration of the 24th April, 1937. On that occasion M. Spaak said that the Anglo-French declaration of the 24th April had closed the period of military agreements; that Belgium&apos;s military problems were now freed from superfluous complications and had become purely and simply a technical problem; that Belgium remained free to solve that problem with complete liberty and independence, and that everything necessary to be done for national defence would be done. This statement was interpreted here as meaning that though Belgium would no longer be willing to conduct formal Staff eonversa-tions, she would regard herself as being now perhaps even more at liberty than before to enter into confidential military contacts with any Power or Powers she liked to choose. This interpretation has now received some confirmation from the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs himself. In a conversation with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 18th November, 1937, during the visit of the King of the Belgians to this country, M. Spaak spoke as follows : &quot; So far as the Belgian Governments own position was concerned, that was now much easier and their people were in consequence more content with their country&apos;s foreign policy.   They were entirely free from the previousH j
French Staff arrangements, which, though they had not, in fact, amounted to a great deal, created an impression of servitude. The Germans had at no time during the discussions of their proposed declaration made any. suggestion that they desired staff talks or military information of any kind. If they had requested this, it would, of course, have been refused. The Belgian Government were now very ready to continue to give us any informa-tion in their power about their defences and their plans generally. If there was any point on which we wished to approach them, they were ready to hear whatever we had to say. M. Spaak was not himself well informed on the question of air problems, but if this was one of the matters on which we wished to speak to the Belgian Government, they would, of course, be glad to consider our views.&quot;This is an offer which it would be well not to leave without response.11. Though the French Government, for their part, have not insisted on the fulfilment of the terms of our note of the 1st April, 1936 (see paragraph 3 above), their air authorities have repeatedly pressed for an extension of the scope of the conversations beyond the limits within which they have hitherto been circum-scribed. An account of these approaches, and of the present state of our exchanges of information with both the French and Belgian Staffs, will be found in paragraphs 20-37 of the memorandum reproduced in Annex I.*12. As stated in paragraph 7 above, one of the main reasons which existed in April 1936 for limiting the scope of the Staff conversations which then took place has now been removed. Mr. Eden considers, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government are justified in pursuing, at least on a hypothetical basis, and within certain definite limits, the examination of the common Anglo-French and Anglo-Belgian military problems which would arise in the event of our being called upon to fulfil our obligation to France or Belgium against Germany under the Locarno Treaty. If it should be necessary, in case of war, for a substantial portion of our Air Force to operate from French or Belgian soil in order to be used effectively against Germany, the case for such a study, so far as the Air Force is concerned, would seem to be all the stronger. In the event of hostilities, the speed with which we could bring our forces into play would presumably be of very great importance; and it is submitted, on grounds of national security, that it would be wise to take any possible step that would contribute to reducing to a minimum the delay which must, in the nature of things, attend the application of our military effort in support of France or Belgium.13. Again, closer co-operation with the French and Belgian staffs would give us greater authority than we possess at present for seeking information and offering observations with regard to those branches of French and Belgian armaments where we have reason to suspect deficiencies or disorganization. This would apply at the present moment to the equipment of the French Air Force in particular.14. It will be recalled that the question of the Air armaments of France and the United Kingdom was discussed during the recent visit of the French Ministers to London. At the final meeting with the French Ministers on 30th November, the Prime Minister said that he had heard that when the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence had the previous evening given the French Ministers some figures about the production of aeroplanes in this country, the extent of British production had been unknown to the French Ministers. Mr. Chamberlain said that he was rather surprised that this was so, and wished to say that, if at any time the French Government wished for any information on points of this kind, they had only to ask and the information would be given. He added that quite recently a German mission had been shown round our Air Force establish -ments, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would be even more willing to do the same for representatives of the French Government if the latter so desired. On another occasion during their visit, the French Ministers stated that the French Army was very expensive, and the French Government had also to do a certain amount for the Navy, with the result that the French Air Force had fallen a little behind-hand. The French Government were, however, going to spend a good deal of money upon the Air Force, and it was understood that they were going to make purchases in America.* Annex I to Enclosure in Papers Nos. CCS. 658 and J.P. 255.
15. There has been an immediate response from the French Government to the Prime Ministers offer. In a despatch dated the 8th December, 1937 (a copy of which, with its enclosure and a covering letter to the Air Ministry, is reproduced as Annex II*), His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris reports that the French authorities have stated that they wish to take immediate advantage of the offer made by the Prime Minister to the French Ministers during their recent visit to London to give the French Government full information regarding our methods of production of service aircraft, together with other technical information. The French authorities suggest four alternative methods by which the desired information might be made available to them. The first three of these have a bearing on the general question of the contacts to be maintained between the British and French General Staffs.16. In these circumstances Mr. Eden feels that the moment is now opportune for a further development in the contact between the British and the French and Belgian Staffs. It seems to him desirable that a greater measure of latitude should be allowed than is at present the case in the communications between the British and the French and Belgian Staffs; and he believes that this would be possible even within the limits laid down in the documents which at present govern them, namely, Section III of the Text of Proposals of March 1936, and the Exchange of Notes of 1st April, 1936, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. He would therefore be grateful if this problem could be examined by the Chiefs of Staff, and if they would give their advice as to the best terms in which to define the scope of these Staff contacts if it were to be decided that some extension of their present scope is called for.17. He would suggest for consideration that the following are the general lines upon which these Staff exchanges should in future be conducted : France.(i) Conversations between the British and French General Staffs, military, naval and air, should be permitted on a generous interpretation of the definitions given in paragraph III of the Text of Proposals of the 19th March, 1936, and in the exchange of notes of the 1st April, 1936, i.e., that they should aim at &quot;arranging the technical conditions &quot; in which our Locarno obligations should be carried out; but that they should not give rise to &apos;&apos; any political undertaking, nor to any obligation regarding the organization of national defence.&quot;(ii) That, as stated in the communique of the 18th April, 1936, information should continue to be transmitted through the channel of the Military, Naval and Air Attaches. This need not preclude the participation of specialists from the two General Staffs in contacts between the Military Attaches in London and Paris and the French and British Service Departments respectively.(iii) No announcement need be made to the French Government that this general extension has been authorised; but, within the limits laid down above, any French requests for exchanges of information or for conversations should receive a favourable response.(iv) In any public reference to these Staff contacts that may be necessary, it could be maintained that the limits laid down in 1936 are still being observed.Belgium.No formal request in general terms should be made to the Belgian Govern-ment for an extension of the existing contracts between the two Staffs; but the questions addressed to the Belgian authorities by our Service attaches in Brussels, or by our Service departments here to the Belgian Service attaches might, in view of the recent remarks to Mr. Eden by the Belgian Foreign Minister, be appreciably increased in scope. Only if there were marked resistance from the Belgian side would the question of a direct approach to the Belgian Government arise.Copies of this letter have been sent to the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry.\ jj, ja,t? *jv(Sgd.)

ANNEX II.Copy of a Letter from the Foreign Office to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.(C 37/G)*      *      * Foreign Office, January 1, 1938.WITH reference to the Foreign Office letter* C 7843/ G of the 16th December, regarding military contacts between the British naval, military and air Staffs on the one hand, and the French and Belgian General Staffs on the other, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a despatch!&quot; to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris, recording a conversation held between the Secretary of State and the French Ambassador in London on the 17th December. Mr. Eden would suggest that the observations made by M. Corbin in the course of this conversation should be considered by the Chiefs of Staff at the same time as the points raised in the Foreign Office letter of the 16th December.2. It will be appreciated that the suggestions advanced by the French Ambassador are very much wider in scope than the points discussed in the Foreign Office letter of the 16th December. The general purpose of the military contacts suggested in that letter was confined to &quot; arranging the technical conditions &quot; in which our Locarno obligations should be carried out in case of unprovoked aggression. The suggestions now made by the French Ambassador are more far-reaching, since what is contemplated is not the consideration of a hypothetical case relating to the execution of the Treaty of Locarno, but the consideration of possible fleet dispositions made necessary by disturbed political conditions in any part of the world, and in particular, at the present moment, in the Far East.3. The Secretary of State desires also to draw attention in this connection to the discussion by the cabinet on the 22nd December of the question of defence expenditure in future years, when it was decided to inform the French Govern-ment of His Majesty&apos;s Governments views respecting the primary role of the British regular Army in time of war. This communication to the French Government may well lead to a request that the problem of Staff contacts in all three Services should be further examined and discussed in its wider aspect.4. Copies of this letter have been sent to the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry.*Jv* -7v-(Signed) WILLIAM STRANG.Enclosure to Annex II.Copy of a Despatch from the Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Paris.(C 8674/3285/17)*      *      * Foreign Office, December 17, 1937.-V- iifc sifeTV- &quot;7V* -TV&quot;DURING the course of a conversation with the French Ambassador this morning, his Excellency remarked that there were certain aspects of the world situation which caused him considerable apprehension. The Rome-Berlin axis was certainly &quot;/not founded on a very sincere friendship, yet it did work very well in the technical sphere. Indeed, in that respect the German and Italian collaboration was much closer than that between England and France, though the real community of interests between our two countries was much greater. This* Enclosure to Paper No. C.O.S. 658 and J.P. 255.f Annex to Enclosure 2.% Cabinet 49 (37), Conclusion 1.
seemed to him not altogether satisfactory. His Excellency explained that he was only speaking personally, but, on my encouraging him to continue, he gave an example : In the. Far East to-day we were faced by a menacing position. He imagined that it would be dangerous for His Majesty&apos;s Government to attempt to take any action there alone when the European situation was so strained. Yet his Excellency presumed that it was a possible development that at some time we might wish to make dispositions of our fleet different from those which existed to-day. So far as he was aware, however, there had been no kind of staff conver-sations between our two Admiralties. With the world as it was to-day, any change in the political situation in any part of it was apt to result in the need for fleet movements. Between us our naval strength was very great, yet we had, it appeared, made no dispositions for any of the eventualities which might arise. Was not this a state of affairs which should be remedied ?2. I told M. Corbin that I had much sympathy with what he had said. He would recollect that the Prime Minister, during the meetings with the French Ministers, had made it quite clear that we were ready to engage in any exchange of information with the French Government. It would certainly be true that, in the event of anything happening in the Far East, which I sincerely trusted would not be the case, necessitating any change in the present disposition of our fleet, the first thing we should wish to do would be to consult the French Govern-ment. I knew that this was very much in the mind of the First Lord. The question really seemed to be whether there should not be exchanges of view now so that we might be each to some extent prepared for the eventualities which might arise.3. His Excellency gave, as one example of close German-Italian technical collaboration, the fact that the area round about Gibraltar seemed to be that used by Germany and not by Italy for Mediterranean training. A short while ago the French Government had even had cause to complain that the German Government had ships in Tangier in excess of those allowed her by treaty. These ships were being continually changed, and M. Corbin was quite confident that this procedure was being carried out in order to give the whole German fleet, by stages, experience of Mediterranean conditions. The French Government now had a considerable part of their fleet in the Atlantic, and in certain eventualities no doubt they would be able to move these ships to the Mediterranean. This was surely a step which might be discussed between us.4. After some further conversation, we agreed that I would refer this subject to my colleagues, while his Excellency would inform his Government of his suggestion.V
Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1938.SECRET. Copy No.1395-B.(Also Paper No. CCS. 679.)COMMITTEE   OF   IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.CABLE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND FRANCE AND THEIR BEARING ON STAFF CONVERSATIONS.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.WE attach a copy of a Note (Annex) in which we have been asked by the Imperial Communications Committee to consider a proposal for the extension to the French coast of a new cable already projected from England to Jersey. It has been suggested by the Foreign Office that this question should be taken up with the French authorities, in view of the advantages of additional cable communication, less vulnerable than the existing French cables, to any British forces which might be operating in North-West Europe.2. From the purely military point of view, and irrespective of any other considerations, an extension to the hinterland of France of the projected new General Post Office cable to Jersey, avoiding the existing vulnerable cable route via Paris, would have obvious strategic advantages in the event of our being allied with France in time of war.Apart from the communication requirements of any military force which might be despatched to the Continent, a safe cable line to the area in which, for some time to come, certain portions of our air force may require refuelling facilities, would be desirable.3. We share the view of the Imperial Communications Committee, that it is most unlikely that the French would undertake the cost of the extension proposed unless the strategical implications were made clear to them. We consider, however, that any approach to the French in this connection by informal discussion between the respective Postal authorities would be most undesirable.4. In a separate Report on the question of staff conversations with France and Belgium (Paper No. 0.0.S. 680) we have emphasised our extreme reluctance to enter into or to extend a system of staff conversations with the French at the present time. We are convinced that the fact that such conversations were taking place, either on the military plane or, in the present connection, as regards the construction of a strategical cable, could not be kept secret. The consequent effect on any political advances towards a better understanding with Germany would, in our opinion, be serious.5.   In view of the political considerations involved, we think that this is a matter for decision by the Committee of Imperial Defence.  Taking into account v our views expressed in Paper No. C.O.S. 680, a decision is required as to whether[16614]
the military advantages of the ultimate establishment of less vulnerable cable communications between this country and France, in the interest of any of our military or air forces which might be operating in French territory in time of war, are outweighed by the grave risk of exciting German suspicion and hostility which would result from the almost inevitable publicity attending collaboration with the French.6. In conclusion we would point out that the construction of a new cable to Jersey will take some time and the subsequent extension to the French coast .even longer. We, for our part, recommend that when the cable to Jersey has been completed, we should review the position and, if necessary, merely inform the French, through the normal diplomatic channels, leaving, them to take the initiative regarding any proposals for an extension of the cable onwards.(Signed) CHATFIELD.C.

ANNEX.[C.O.S. 672] -Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.CABLE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND TRANCE AND THEIR BEARING ON STAFF CONVERSATIONS.Note by the Secretary.AT their 103rd Meeting on the 20th December, 1937, the Imperial Communi-cations Committee discussed a Memorandum submitted by the War Office representative in regard to the arrangements for the provision of telephone and telegraph communication between the United Kingdom and a field force operating in North-West Europe.2. In this Memorandum it was pointed out that if communication was through the existing Cross-Channel cables in the vicinity of Dover-Calais and thence through the French underground cable system, then, whether the field force assembled east or west of the River Seine, the greater part of the vital communications between the United Kingdom and the field force (and within the field force) would have to pass through the highly vulnerable centre Paris, whilst, if the force assembled west of the Seine, the communication to the United Kingdom would be unprotected by forward troops.3. The General Post Office have now under consideration the question of communication with the Channel Islands which is at present met by an old-type of submarine cable from Compas Cove to Jersey. The alternatives before the Post Office are the use of wireless or the provision of a new submarine cable, the latter being rather more expensive than the former. If, however, the latter alternative was adopted it would be quite practicable to extend the cable to the French Coast, probably to a point on the Cherbourg Peninsula, whence communication would have to be made to the French underground system at Caen. The Post Office would be prepared to adopt the alternative of a new cable to the Channel Islands, having regard to its advantages from the defence point of view, on the presumption that the necessary extensions to be connected to the French system would be made.4.. . In the ordinary way the French would be expected to bear half the cost of the extension of the cable from the Channel Islands to France, the total cost of which will be of the order of  15,000, as well, of course, as the whole cost of effecting in France the junction with their own underground system at Caen. But as this extension cannot be justified from the commercial telegraph and telephone point of view the French Postal Administration will almost certainly refuse to share the cost, unless the real object of the extension is appreciated.5. At the meeting of the Imperial Communications Committee the Post Office representative stated that the relations between the two Postal Adminis-trations were such that it would be quite possible for the British Administration to indicate the significance of the extension to the French Administration in an informal way, provided that they were authorised to do so. But the Imperial Communications Committee did not feel justified in approving such a course in view of the attitude of the Foreign Office representative who asked that it should receive further consideration before adoption, and of the War Office view con-tained in their memorandum in which particular stress is laid on the necessity of refraining from any enquiries to the French Authorities regarding the available-bility of means of communication in war. It was, therefore, decided at the meeting that the Post Office should proceed with the plan of replacing the sub-marine cable to the Channel Islands with a view to its ultimate extension to France, and that the War Office representative would raise in his own Department the question of whether it was possible to communicate the significance of the proposal to the French through the British Military Attache in Paris.
o. The Foreign Office have now informed the Secretary of the Imperial Communications Committee that his Department consider that the real purpose of the cable might well be disclosed to the French Authorities, and suggest that the subject might be considered by the Chiefs of Staff at the same time as the question of staff conversations with Belgium and France which has already been referred to them.(Signed) M.

February 1938.SECRET.Copy No. 9 61396-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH THE BELGIAN AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS ON THE SUPPLY OF FOOD. OIL AND COAL.THE accompanying Foreign Office letter and enclosure is circulated by direction of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence for consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence in connection with the question of Staff Conversations with France and Belgium.   (OLD. Paper No. 1394-B.)Letter from the Foreign Office to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence. [No. C 667/667/62]Sir, Foreign Office, February 1, 1938.I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to refer to Foreign Office letter* C 7843/G of the 16th December, 1937, on the subject of contacts between the British naval, military and air staffs on the one hand, and the Belgian and French General Staffs on the other, and to state that he has also had under consideration the question of exchanges of information with the Belgian and French Govern-ments on problems connected with the supply of food, oil and coal in time of war.2. An historical note recording the progress which, according to the information in the possession of the Foreign Office, has so far been made in the discussion of these problems, is enclosed an as annex to this letter. From this it will be seen that the discussions which are now taking place between the Food (Defence Plans) Department and the competent Belgian and French authorities, under the authority of a decision by the appropriate committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, are making useful progress and are apparently proceeding to the satisfaction of all parties conceited. It is, in Mr. Eden&apos;s view, desirable that any discussions which may be contemplated on the cognate questions of supplies of oil and coal in time of war should be similarly regularised and that, so far as it is possible, a uniform policy should be followed in each case. Mr. Eden is of the opinion that such exchanges of information are likely to be of value to both parties, and he considers that their note by the Secretary.(Signed)M. P. A. HANKEY.2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1 February 4, 1938.ENCLOSURE.Reproduced as Paper No. COS. 658.[16637]b
scope should not be unduly restricted. They might, in particular, deal with problems relating to requirements in the event of war, and alternative sources of supply; and with the organizations which would be set up in the countries concerned in the event of a crisis. Such conversations need not involve undesirable commitments; and both the Belgian and French Governments have made it clear that they understand that the actual and proposed exchanges of information would not have this effect. Mr. Eden appreciates that there may be cases in which His Majesty&apos;s Government are not in a position to give direct assistance to either Belgium or France. Where this is so, he thinks it desirable that the fact should be clearly stated; for if it is known that no help will be forthcoming from British sources, the other Governments concerned can make their plans for settling alternative sources of supply3. As regards oil. the Supply Board are apparently prepared to contemplate some arrangement with the Belgian authorities whereby the Belgian and British Governments would not compete against&apos; each other in foreign markets; and possibly, also, consultations regarding the problem of shipping to Belgium such supplies as may be purchased (see paragraph 6 of the Annex to the present letter). On the other hand, though it is now almost a year since the French Government first proposed conversations on the question of oil supplies, little progress has yet been made. The French Government have made it clear that they attach great importance to this question; and circumstances might well arise, in a crisis in which both France and Great Britain were involved, where it would be also of importance to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the French armed forces should be assured of adequate supplies. It is thus clearly desirable that certain preliminary investigations as regards the respective requirements of the two countries should be made in advance.4. Finally, it is suggested that any conversations which may take place Avith the French authorities on the subject of oil supplies should, proceed on similar lines to those which are contemplated with the Belgian authorities, and that they should be of similar scope. It is scarcely reasonable to ask the French Government to discuss the problem of food supplies and, at the same time, to be reluctant to accede to a French request for similar conversations about oil.5. As regards coal, it will be seen that the Belgian Government have not as yet expressed any wish for conversations. An approach by the French Government is, hoAvever, to be anticipated in the near future; and it would seem desirable that the response to such an approach should be settled in conformity AAdth the attitude adopted in regard to food and oil.6. &apos; In these circumstances Mr. Eden AA^ould suggest, for the consideration of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, that the policy to be followed in discussions with the Belgian and French GoArernments on the subject of supplies of food, oil and coal should be submitted for examination to a Committee designated for that purpose, so that the attitude adopted in each case may, so far as necessary, be co-ordinated and the maximum degree of uniformity secured.7.

(Signed)      WILLIAM SPRANG.Annex to Enclosure.Disctissions with the French and Belgian Governments concerning Supplies ofFood, Oil and Coal in Time of War.Historical Note.I. Food.&apos;(a) Belgium. v ^1. THE question of supplies to Belgium of munitions and other necessaries, including food and oil, in the event of war Avas raised by Belgian Ministers on three occasions during 1936. These approaches Avere discussed at a Cabinet meeting on the 13th January, 1937, at Avhich the Secretary of State submitted a
memorandum (CP. 8 (37)) recommending that on political grounds the Cabinet should authorise conversations between the Belgian Military Attache and the War Office in order to ascertain exactly what the Belgian request amounted to and to endeavour in every possible way to meet it. He suggested, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War, that the Belgian Military Attache should be instructed (1) to state the Belgian Governments requirements in detail, and (2) to explain whether it was a matter of immediate purchase or of making arrangements now whereby purchases could be made in the event of war. This proposal was approved by the Cabinet. (Conclusion 1 (37) of the 13th January, 1937.) On the 20th January the Belgian Military Attache wrote to the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence enclosing a detailed list of Belgium&apos;s requirements of munitions, food, and raw materials, including fuel, in the event of war. A copy of this letter was forwarded to Lord Halifax by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in a letter dated the 6th February, 1937, in which Sir Thomas Inskip stated that &quot; before any considered judgment could be given as to how far the requirements could be met from here, the appropriate committees would have to go through the items on the list and report on them. Some would probably present no great difficulty if the requirements were added to our own and the capacity located accordingly. But of others we are far as yet from seeing our own way to the supplies we should need in the first year of war.&quot; Sir T. Inskip suggested, however, that before the Supply Board made any investigations the political implications of this request should be further considered. Mr. Eden replied in a letter dated the 1st March confirming the view he had already expressed in his memorandum to the Cabinet, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should endeavour in every possible way to meet the Belgian request, and he suggested that, to avoid undesirable delay, the technical departments should set to -work at once on a detailed study of the position.2. That part of the list of Belgian requirements which related to food was referred by the Supply Board to the Food (Defence Plans) Department. The authority of the latter was reinforced in July 1937 by a decision of the Food Supply Sub-Committee of the OLD. &quot; to authorize technical discussions to be opened in consultation with the Foreign Office .... with representatives of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Argentina and Denmark&quot; with a view to securing our own food supplies in time of war. After consultation with the Foreign Office as to the best method of opening conversations, it was decided to invite the Belgians, through the Belgian Military Attache, to send a civilian technical expert over from Brussels to discuss matters with the Food (Defence Plans) Department. The Belgian Military Attache replied that the Belgian request had originated with the Belgian military authorities and that no civilian official would be competent to discuss it. It so happened, however, that a member of the Food (Defence Plans) Department was going to Belgium on leave in September, and the Belgian Military Attache, being aware of this, suggested that when in Brussels he should have an informal talk with a Major Beretze of the &quot; Service of the Mobilisation of the Nation.&quot; An interview with Major Beretze accordingly took place in Brussels on the 22nd September, 1937, when plans for a visit of Major Beretze to London were made and a provisional programme of the subjects for discussion drawn up. A discussion took place in London on the 18th October, 1937, between Major Beretze and officials of the Food (Defence Plans) Department, at which, in the absence of the Military Attache, the Belgian Air Attache was also present. A detailed examination was made of the list of Belgian requirements of food and food-stuffs and methods of dealing with the anticipated shortage of&apos; some commodities, including alternative sources of supply, were discussed. In general, it was clear that the Belgian authorities fully accepted the improbability of Belgium being-supplied with any food or food-stuffs from stocks in the United Kingdom. On the other hand, they were interested in exploring further the arrangements that might be desirable for co-ordinating purchases of food supplies from countries overseas and the chartering of neutral tonnage.3. A further interview on the subject took place between the Belgian Air Attach^ and a member of the Food (Defence Plans) Department at the beginning of January 1938. The former stated that he had heard from Major Beretze that, with a view to co-ordinating purchases of overseas supplies in time of war, the Belgian Government had set up a &quot; London Purchasing Committee &quot; which[16637] b 2
would leave for London on the first day of mobilisation. Major Wouters was not quite sure how this Committee was constituted, but he thought it would consist of officers of the Reserve, one or two members of the Committee being allocated for food purposes. It had also been decided that in time of war no purchases in Great Britain or America would be made without the prior consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Major Wouters gave further information regarding the action taken by the Belgian authorities for dealing with internal sources of supply. He also indicated that Major Beretze would be coming to London again for further discussions in about a month&apos;s time.(b) France.4. In the case of France, unlike Belgium, the initiative came from the British side. The problem of food supplies in time of war was first discussed with the French in connection with the question of air-raid precautions in July 1937, when a member of the Food (Defence Plans) Department had an interview with an officer of the French Ministry for Air. Attention was subsequently directed towards the food situation in Germany, and a discussion on this subject took place with officers of the Deuxieme Bureau of the French Ministry of War on the 19th August, 1937.5. On the 1st December. 1937, in virtue of the decision of the Food Supply Sub-Committee of the OLD. of July 1937, referred to in paragraph 2 above, the Foreign Office, at the request of the Food (Defence Plans) Department, suggested to the Commercial Attache at the French Embassy that informal conversations on the question of food supplies should take place between representatives of that Department and competent French officials. M. de Bellefon undertook to refer the matter to his Government at once. Contact has since been established between M. de Bellefon and the Food (Defence Plans) Department, and on the 7th January, 1938, a memorandum was sent to the former, defining the scope and objects of the proposed conversations and suggesting that an exchange of information and ideas should take place in regard to (i) the machinery that might have to be brought into existence for facilitating co-ordination in the supply of imported food and feeding-stuffs to the two countries, and (ii) the probable requirements of each food and feeding stuff during the first month and the first year of a major war.11.-0*7.(a) Belgium.6. Among the requirements of the Belgian Government, specified in the list communicated by the Belgian Military Attache, were: aviation fuel (&quot; 77 octane,&quot; &quot; 87 octane,&quot; and &quot; mineral oil &quot;) and fuel for cars and lorries (petrol, gas oil, mineral oil). Particular attention was directed to the pressing-need for aviation fuel and it was stated that Belgium would need supplies from abroad on the second day of hostilities. So far as the Foreign Office are aware, no further conversations have taken place with the Belgian authorities on this particular point, but the Belgian requirements have been under consideration by the Supply Board at the same time as the other items on the Belgian Military Attached list. In an interim report by the Supply Board, a copy of which was communicated to the Secretary of. State by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in a letter dated the 10th December, 1937, reference was made to the question of oil under the heading &quot; Cases in which the articles or materials asked for are not manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.&quot; &quot;In such cases,&quot; the report states, &quot; it is thought that the Belgian Government must be advised to purchase their requirements abroad themselves, subject to some agreement whereby the Belgian and British Governments would not be competing against each other in foreign markets, and possibly some consultation regarding the difficult problem of shipping to Belgium any stores that are purchased. Cases of this kind arise largely in the supply of raw materials, including oil and food-stuffs, and it is understood that some of them were discussed at length in the conversations which Major Beretze had with the Food (Defence Plans) Department and the Board of Trade, at which a representative of the Directorate of Sea Transport was also present.   The establishment in London of a Belgian
mission for dealing with questions of this kind and co-ordinating purchases generally on the lines suggested in the report of the Sub-Committee on Food Supply in time of War on the &apos; Control of Supplies, Prices and Distribution of Principal Foods &apos; (paper No. F.S. 37) would appear to be desirable, and should, it is felt, be encouraged.&quot; The Foreign Office has no further information as regards progress made in this connection.(b) France.7. On the 4th March, 1937, the French Ambassador communicated to the Foreign Office a memorandum suggesting that it was most desirable that the French and British Governments should examine together the problems connected with the supply and transport of oil in the event of a crisis. The memorandum further proposed that conversations on the subject might be opened at once between the competent officials of the Mines Department and the French Ministry of Public Works. This proposal was at the end of 1937 still under consideration by the Petroleum Department and the Service Departments. Advantage was, however, taken of the presence in London in October 1937 of a member of the French Ministry of Public Works to arrange that he should have a purely informal discussion with a member of the Petroleum Department; and on the 13th January, 1938, the French Ambassador was informed by the Foreign Office, with the concurrence of the Petroleum Department, that, from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, there would be no objection to further informal conversations of a similar nature taking place from time to time. It would, however, be understood that such conversations would not result in any definite inter-governmental commitments.III.-Coal.(a) Belgium.8. Coal does not appear in the list of Belgian requirements, and accordingly no discussions on this subject have as yet taken place with the Belgian Government.(b) France.9. In a conversation with a member of the Foreign Office on the subject of food supplies in time of war on the 1st December, 1937, the Commercial Attache of the French Embassy stated that he had received instructions, which he had not yet had time to carry out, to enquire whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would he prepared to open similar informal discussions without commitments about supplies of coal in wartime. There do not, however, appear to have been any further developments since that date.Foreign Office, January 28, 1938.
