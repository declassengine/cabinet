My colleagues will have been expecting me to report to them on the position of recruiting for the Army and to make proposals with a view to its further improvement. The Cabinet Committee which considered this question at the beginning of 1937 stated that &quot; on the assumption that recruiting does not deteriorate further&quot; the gaps between establishment and strength would be in 1938 20,300, and in 1940 31,000. On this basis, the Committee stated it would only be possible in 1938 to provide drafts for overseas by reducing home units to cadre, while in 1940 it would be impossible to provide drafts, or in other words to garrison the Empire.   (CP. 11 (37).)2. Measures were introduced in 1937 for improving conditions of service in the Army, and during the year many devices have been resorted to. But despite these it has proved extremely difficult to provide drafts, and the present shortage on existing establishments is approximately 23,000. To overtake the shortage and to meet the normal run-out and wastage during the 5 years 1938-1942 recruit requirements will be 166,000 apart from additions to establishment which have been regarded as necessary to meet the Governments defence programme. Allowing for these additions, an intake of from 175,000 to 180,000 recruits would be required or an average of from 35,000 36,000 a year. But the review which I am undertaking of the role of the Army makes the future establishments uncertain. In the financial year 1936, the intake was under 23,000, and in the calendar year 1937, 26,094. It is expected that the intake for the current financial year will be about 28,500 new recruits plus about 3,000 reservists rejoining the colours under the scheme introduced in August last.3. For the reasons given by the Cabinet Committee (referred to in paragraph 1) no less than because a failure to make good the difference between the actual strength of the Army and its Establishment is unmistakeable evidence of our weakness, we should take steps to overcome the. reluctance of suitable men in sufficient numbers to adopt the Army as a calling. Moreover, there is great expectancy that the State will recognize that the conditions of military service are due for adjustment towards modern standards.4. After a lengthy examination of various possible courses and inter-departmental discussions with the other Service departments and with the Treasury, I put forward the following proposals for the acceptance of my colleagues.A. Intake of Boys5. The Navy has a pool of recruitment from boys whom it takes young and trains to become sailors. There could be no surer means of recruitment for the Army than to train boys to go into&apos; the Army: and such training would also benefit the youth of the nation. At present some 5,000 boys are under training for the Army. Of the total, 2,800 are-trained with units as drummers, buglers, etc.: the balance are at schools and establishments under training to become skilled tradesmen, of whom there is a serious shortage in the Army. I propose that these numbers should be substantially increased, by taking in next year 2,000 boy tradesmen and some 1,500 boys for training with units, and thereby raising the total numbers under training to some 7,000.  This, on the information
available, is likely to be as many boy recruits as we can expect, but if the scheme proves a success and larger numbers are forthcoming, it can be expanded later, not only by continuing the intake proposed for subsequent years but by increasing it; if necessary, the training of general service boys can be transferred from units to Central schools.6. But the increased enlistment of boys will only produce long term results and any additions to the strength of the Army through such increase cannot be effective for three years, and then only to an extent limited by the numbers taken. To produce immediate results it is necessary to effect immediate improve-ments in the conditions of service which the Army offers.B: pay. Among such conditions pay and prospects are the first considerations. It is often said that a soldiers pay of 2s. a day when he enlists is less than a housemaid&apos;s, and from many quarters I have been urged to increase the scale of pay introduced in 1925 by is. a day. But attractive as such an increase would be, it would involve an additional charge, most of it immediate, of some  3 millions on Army Funds and , 1 million on India and Burma, and would moreover entail increases in the basic rates of the other Services, since the sailor and the airman both receive 2s. a day on joining. I propose, therefore, to proceed more economically by proposing increases of pay not basically but as the soldiers service progresses. In this respect the private soldier on the 1925 scale of pay compares unfavourably with the sailor on the corresponding scale. The private soldier on 1925 scales of pay, if he reaches a certain standard of educational and military proficiency, earns 2s. 6d. a day at the end of a year&apos;s man&apos;s service : at the end of three years mans service he may qualify for an increment of 6d. a day: 3s. is the total a soldier on normal rates can receive by way of pay unless he be promoted. This compares unfavourably with what a sailor on the corresponding scale can earn, and I have had a scheme worked out which will enable the soldier to keep more in step with the sailor.8. I propose to amend the 1925 scale of pay to provide that an increment of 3d. a day should be given to the private on normal rates of pay at the end of his first years mans service and a further 3d. at the end of the second year pro-vided that such service be satisfactory: and that at the end of his 8th and 13th years&apos; man&apos;s service he should be eligible for an additional 3d. a day good conduct pay. Further, as an inducement to the trained soldier on normal rates to put his very best into his work and if possible to do somewhat better than his fellows, I propose to institute a rate of special proficiency pay of 3d. a day which may be given at the Commanding Officers discretion to not more than two-thirds of the men, below the rank of serjeant, of 3 years&apos; man&apos;s service on the strength of his unit. This will take the place of the various kinds of specialist pay which the sailor can earn and which are not suited to Army conditions. These additions to the pay of men on normal rates will involve certain additions to nien on tradesmen^ rates of pay, and such men will be eligible for the additional 3d. at 8 and 13 years&apos; service. But so far as possible in view of the effect on the Royal Air Force with its large number of tradesmen, I have left the tradesmen^ rates of pay untouched. There are, however, consequential increases in the pay of certain non-commissioned officers on ordinary rates of pay.C. Terms of Service9. At the present time the general terms of enlistment are what may be described as of medium length, normally 7 years with the Colours and 5 years with the Reserve. Only a minority of men is ultimately allowed to serve on for pension. The 7 year period with the Colours is just too long to allow a man to settle himself in certain professions in civil life, notably the police, while on the other hand the uncertainty of being allowed to serve on for pension deters those from enlisting who would do so if they were sure of being able to make the Army a career. To meet the former type of recruit I propose to reduce the normal terms of service from 7 with the Colours and 5 with the Reserve
to 5 with the Colours and 7 with the Reserve. This innovation, allowing for the counterbalancing effect of increasing the long service element, will increase the number of recruits which will be required in the normal from 32,000 to 38,000 a year, on the basis of present establishments, but it is hoped that the change will in itself contribute to increased numbers and I propose therefore to introduce it as soon as the trend of recruiting justifies it. At the same time, to meet the case of the man seeking a career, I propose to increase the number of long service men ultimately to about 50 per cent, of the Army as compared with less than one-third at present. Instead of deciding, as now, whether a man may serve on for pension only after he has completed some five or six years&apos; service the decision will be taken in the case of a proportion of recruits at the time of enlistment. The enlistment of long service men will take place gradually and the number to be permitted to enlist in any one year will be settled with reference to the recruiting and drafting conditions prevalent at the time. A certain number of short service men will as at present be allowed to extend their service with a view to re-engagement for pension. An automatic result of the shorter term of enlistment will be to reduce to 4 years or less the tour of foreign service, the present length of which is a powerful deterrent to recruiting  perhaps in time it may be possible to reduce it even to three.A possible result of the longer term of service may be to allow greater flexibility in the employment of the men concerned and a transfer from one arm to another during the course of service.D. Marriage10. At present a soldier is recognized as married at 26 years of age. At that age he is eligible to be placed on the marriage allowance roll which entitles him to an allowance in respect of his wife varjdng from 10s. for a man on the lowest rate of pay to 7s. for the more highly paid man, together with children&apos;s allowances. Of those on the marriage allowance roll a certain proportion, varying from all W.O.S and Staff Sergts. to 3 per cent, of the total number of Guardsmen, are eligible for the married quarters roll. This roll entitles them to married quarters or an allowance in lieu, to marriage allowance (subject to a deduction of 7s. a week) and to certain other privileges such as free medical attendance.- It has been represented to me that as all social legislation encourages marriage and an unemployed man receives an allowance in respect of his wife, the Army should similarly recognize all married men and, as my colleagues know, there is considerable political pressure in this direction. In view of administrative and financial difficulties I do not, however, at present propose to go so far but to confine myself to remedying the position of soldiers of 26 and upwards on the marriage allowance roll which is most unsatisfactory; the allowance is not sufficient to enable the family to be kept in decency and the hardship and distress which exist give rise to much criticism and are a serious obstacle to recruiting. The Air Ministry have put forward proposals under which all married soldiers and airmen at the age of 26 shall receive an allowance of 17s. a week for a wife with additions for each child. This new allowance will replace the existing marriage allowance and also, in the case of men on the married quarters roll, lodging, fuel and light allowances. If quarters are available and allotted to married soldiers and air-men a charge will be made, varying upwards from 17s. for the smallest quarters. All the families would be eligible for the other existing privileges of the married quarters roll. I propose to adopt the Air Ministry scheme although in some cases it will have the disadvantage of giving those on the married quarters roll slightly less than . at present and to postpone to a more opportune time any large programme of building married quarters which I had originally contemplated.11. I attach a schedule summarizing the proposals contained in this paper together with an estimate of their cost. While these proposals as a whole add a considerable annual charge to be borne by the taxpayer, they are more economical than the proposals currently in the public mind, and it will be realized that the measures of rearmament to which we are committed will be overweighted on the materiel side if at the same time measures are not taken to secure the personnel;  nor is it possible  to  contemplate with  equanimity a time
which, as I have stated above, will inevitably come and come soon unless special steps are taken to obtain recruits, when we shall not be able to meet our liabilities under the present policy for providing overseas garrisons and for policing the Empire. It will, I hope, be admitted that the proposals herein put forward are a moderate and just recognition of the need for improvement in the conditions of the soldier&apos;s service and for thus making it more attractive to men of the type we require. I trust therefore that I shall have my colleagues&apos; support for my proposals.Summary of Proposals and Estimate of Cost (paragraph n of Memorandum)	British Funds.		Indian and Burma Funds (a).		193S.	Ultimately.	193S.	Ultimately.1. Intake of boys (paragraph 5)The proposal is to increase the intake of trade boys during the next two or three years from 550 to 2,000 and of general duty boys from about 1,000 to 1,500.2. Pay (paragraphs 7-8)...It is proposed to give increases at various stages of the service of the soldier on normal (post-1925) rates largely on the lines of Naval rates. So far as possible tradesmen&apos;s rates have not been increased.3. Terms of Service (paragraph 9)Roughly half the Army to be on 5 years with the Colours and 7 with the Reserve and the rest on long service (pensionable) engagements.4. Marriage (paragraph 10)At present married men 26 years of age and over are either on the Married Quarters Roll or the Marriage Allowance Roll. The former receive quarters and other privileges which the latter do not. It is proposed to bring all married men aged 26 and over on to one composite roll and to give a new allowance (17s. a week) covering the present marriage allowance and lodging, fuel and light allowances, with additions for each child. If quarters are provided, a charge will be made.Totals  Capital Recurrent ...(a) The Indian and Burma figures do not allow for increased Home Effective Charges.(b) No data available.L.
