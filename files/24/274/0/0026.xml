For the information of my colleagues I have drawn up the following 79statement of the dispositions and contemplated organization of the land forces, Genenin order that they may see what resources are available and to what use it is 3285 intended to adapt them in the light of the new role allotted to the Army.*2. In preparing the Army for war the menace of air attack is a primary consideration. On the outbreak of war defence against air attack may be the primary requirement: in this major respect Home Defence is in the first category of importance, and in a form unknown in 1914.The priorities in Home Defence are Air Defence; Internal Security, which assumes a widened scope in the light of air raid precautions; and Coast Defence.3. There are two Regular Anti-Aircraft Groups\ provided for the protection of the Regular Army and available as a mobile reserve to A.D.G.B. to the extent to which, and for the time during which, any part of these groups may be at home. These Regular Groups are now composed of R.A. and R.E. personnel, as are also A.A. units abroad. Coast Defences abroad are, in generaL similarly manned. The proportion of R.A. and R.E. personnel so employed will amount on approved establishments to over 25 per cent, and over 33 per cent, of these two Corps respectively. As the great majority of the personnel are found by the Royal Artillery and the duties are more appropriate to this Regiment it is proposed to form a separate branch of the Royal Artillery to&apos; man both the guns and the lights of Regular Air and Coast Defence units at home and abroad. This reorganization will involve, later, some similar adjust-ment in the Territorial Army.4. A scheme is being evolved under which defence against low-flying attack will be undertaken by the employees of factories and public utility companies.5. Two Territorial divisions are at present employed in the Air Defence of Great Britain. Their total establishments are 608 guns, 2,547 lights, 48,000 personnel: They cover an area from Newcastle to Portsmouth, with defences at the outlying ports. Under the full Ideal Scheme the additional requirements would be 656 guns, 2,137 lights, 45,000 personnel.To fulfil this scheme about two more Territorial Air Defence divisions would be needed: these would be formed partly by conversion of existing Territorial units and partly by raising new units. The latter course would be necessary in some cases since.the possibility of conversion depends on whether the requisite number of units are both concentrated and suitably situated.* CP. 316 (37) and Cabinet 49, Item i, Conclusion (c) (ii).f Of these approximately half one group is at present in or en route for Egypt.Home DefenceRegular Air Defence UnitsDefence against Low Flying AttackTerritorial Air Defence Formations
6. Of the Ideal Scheme the Cabinet have approved the next two stages, namely the Tyne defences and the Forth and Clyde defences. These entail the provision of 32 guns, 480 lights, 7,500 personnel (equivalent to about one third of a division) over and above the two divisions already in being. There will thus remain, on a normal basis, about 11^ T.A. divisions, or, if the Ideal Scheme is approved in full, about 10 T.A. divisions available for other purposes.To proceed, unless the Cabinet in their review of priorities so desire, with further stages of the Ideal Scheme at the present time would be at the undue expense of other items of the rearmament programme, for which but a limited industrial capacity is available. Indeed the present approved programme of A.D.G.B. is already delaying rearmament in other directions.Internal Security7. Under the chaotic conditions which may be produced by air attacks a outrance a large and widely distributed force of disciplined troops will be needed. They will be required to co-operate with the civil authorities in many-tasks, such as keeping open communications, both road and rail, assisting with wireless, defending vulnerable points against sabotage, and helping in the smooth working of Air Raid Precautions. All troops at home, whether Regular or Territorial, maj&apos; have to play their part in these duties, and the General Staff propose to give attention to the question of training in them, without, however, giving the impression that an actual state of emergency exists at present.Coast Defence8. The Coast Defence of Great Britain, mainly undertaken to meet naval requirements, is entrusted to units of the Territorial Army, numbering 35 batteries which, with lights, have an establishment of 7,330 officers and men. The command of the sea, which in itself makes any considerable attack from seaward improbable, is reinforced by. the deterrent effect of our aircraft. A high order of precedence involving disproportionate expenditure on Coast Defences at Home &quot;does not therefore seem desirable.British Commitments Abroad9. Second in priority to Home Defence comes the discharge of British commitments overseas, which include defended ports on the Trade Routes. Our obligations, exclusive of India and Burma, are set out in Appendix $/ which tabulates (a) the existing garrisons and (b) the size and type of garrisons which, if they were available, would provide the minimum insurance for internal security and defence against external attack.This minimum is based on the principle that wherever sea communications are liable to interruption, by sea, land or air, the garrison should be maintained in peace time at a strength adequate for defence at the outbreak of war. Alter-natively, the necessary reserves should be held in the neighbourhood, available to reinforce at short notice.10. The existing garrisons of Gibraltar and Malta include four &quot; short tour &quot; battalions; moreover there are three such battalions in Palestine and two in Egypt. Some of these &quot; short tour &quot; battalions are only some 300 strong, owing to the recruiting situation. They are composed of officers and men who, under the Cardwell system, would normally be serving at home but who find them-selves detailed for an extra tour of service overseas.Our Imperial commitments in peace can only be discharged by makeshifts and devices (e.g., short tour battalions, calling up Section A Reservists, etc.) which place a great strain on the resources of the Army and on the forbearance of the soldier. . ,  \  ,   .In Appendix 2 is a statement showing the strength and distribution of British troops at home and abroad.. 11. To sum up: it will be seen that a total of 28 British battalions are now stationed overseas, excluding India arid Burma, the infantry equivalent of some 2^ divisions (measured by present standards),&apos; together with the mobile division it is proposed to organize from&apos;the troops now in Egypt, If resources were available and conditions permitted, it would be desirable to hold overseas in addition one mobile division, one division, and five battalions.
0 *3 Q(J        ^The use of &quot;-hnperial-Personnel&apos;&apos;-12. Throughout the Empire there are at present a number of regular units composed of local personnel such as the King&apos;s African Rifles, the Royal West African Frontier Force, the Sudan Defence Force, the Hong Kong and Singapore Royal Artillery, the Malay Regiment, etc. The majority of&quot; trie units are not under die control of the War Office. The total personnel amounts to about 17,000 officers and men. This figure does not include the considerable volunteer organizations that also exist on a territorial basis, such as the Ceylon Defence Force, the Kenya Defence Force, the Singapore Volunteer Corps and many others. Organizations of these kinds, whether on a regular or volunteer basis, are invaluable in reducing the number of regular British units to be maintained. Moreover, the psychological effect on the personnel of undertaking military responsibilities if? of high value in counteracting subversive teachings.I - therefore contemplate extending the system, beginning with the raising of a battalion in Malta of local personnel on a regular basis, if the Colony will make a financial contribution. This battalion, when raised, would make up the existing deficiency of a battalion in the Colony. I also propose to dilute regular British anti-aircraft and Coast Defence units with local personnel to the full extent that circumstances make this course reasonable.13. In this connection I would call attention to the desirability of some degree of regional responsibility, or at least assistance by the Dominions, in peace, in the defence of Imperial communications; Singapore is an obvious case in point. Although I am aware that the suggestion is not a new one I am of the opinion that it should be again raised specifically with the Governments concerned.India14. By far the largest part of the Regular Army stationed overseas in peace is absorbed by the garrisons of India and Burma. Since the reorganization which followed the mutiny, the establishment of British troops has been reduced by only 20,000 men to 57,000. The establishment of the native Indian Army has risen by 7,000 to 139,000, backed by reserves of 37,000 men. In the period there have been great changes in India the effects of which seem to suggest the desirability of re-examining the present requirements. Among such changes are the increased mobility of armies, the advent of the Air Arm, and the diminution of danger to Indian frontiers from external aggression.The government of India have accepted, subject to the situation within and beyond the land frontiers of India permitting, certain commitments to despatch forces overseas to discharge Imperial tasks not directly connected with the defence of India.These include the following:  (a) Reinforcement for Egypt (including Aden) 1 Infantry Brigade Group.(b) Reinforcement for Singapore 1 Infantry Brigade Group.(c) Garrison for Anglo-Iranian Oilfields 1 Infantiy Brigade Group.In addition, the Government of India have potential commitments in relation to the reinforcement of Hong Kong and Burma, and normally one Indian battalion is stationed at Hong Kong and one at Malaya.15. Because of the special difficulties of the Mediterranean passage it is desirable to locate part of the Imperial strategic reserve, as well as its sources of supply, east of the Mediterranean basin. The present limitations on the availability of British forces in India to meet an emergency elsewhere to the best advantage are an inconvenient and perhaps dangerous restraint. Besides the questions of the actual proportion of British troops in India, and their availability as reserves, there are other questions which call for solution. Among these are the reorganization of the Army in India on modern lines, the speed at which it can be effected, and the reduction of establishments as part of that reorganization. Until decisions have been reached there can be no satisfactory re-distribution of the British Army as a whole in accordance with present strategic needs, nor can there be, in accordance with the same needs, a suitable reorganization of the rest of the Army.
To these questions might be added another the amenities of British troops, who are dependent for their comfort on the willingness and ability of. India to meet their share of the cost.16. I hope that the Prime Minister, with the concurrence of my colleagues, would agree to initiate conversations between the India Office and the War Office with a view to reaching an agreement.Present Resources17. Under the former role of the Army four divisions and a Mobile division were being organized to be able to go to the Continent in 15 days. The War Office had requested, but not received, authority to proceed with the logical implications of this role, which involved the subsequent despatch of 12 more divisions, in echelons of four divisions at a time. It is now proposed, so long as the present organization prevails, to be able to despatch overseas within 3 weeks 2 Regular divisions and the Mobile division, equipped for an eastern theatre. They could be followed by the other two Kegular divisions in z -f 40 days.It is also proposed to hold a pool of equipment, including the necessary war reserves, sufficient to put a further two divisions, Regular or Territorial, into the field in four months after the outbreak of war. By that time industrial out-put will have begun to make up its lee-way and the remaining divisions, up to ten in number could, we hope, be in possession of modern equipment ten months after mobilization. As their state of training and the supply of stores and war reserves develop, these additional divisions could be available for defensive or counter-offensive operations. It will be recalled that authority has already been given* for the Territorial Army to receive equipment of the same type as that of the Regular Army to enable it to be trained in peace.Reorganization18. It is now necessary to proceed to a reorganization of the divisions which were being prepared for the Continental role, and on new principles. Smaller divisions are easier to manage, to move, to supply and to ship.Quality combined with mobility can diminish the need for mere numbers of men. The foundations of tactical effectiveness will therefore be revised in the light of modern conditions. A figure of 200,000 Regular soldiers is not,, in itself, large in relation to our world-wide exposure, but by applying the principle that strength is measured not so much by man power as by fire power with mobility, it should be possible to use the men available with an increasing ratio of effect.19. Reorganization will accordingly take place not only of the divisional esta biishment as a whole but also of units within the division. By reducing the size of the divisions a larger number of more compact formations can be organized, suitable for quick despatch and for effective action in any part of the world. The same number of guns, grouped in larger units for the better development of their fire power, will give a proportionately increased support to smaller infantry units. The smaller divisions being more highly mechanized and more economically manned will not only enhance our tactical advantages in war but will enable the money devoted to the Army to be spent more usefully and with more effective results.These principles apply equally to the organization of Territorial divisions, whose establishments are now being re-examined.20. We must also adopt all possible expedients for making the best use of oui fully trained man power, by relieving it in war of duties equally well performed by others, and by reinforcing it from all available sources. As illustrations of what can be accomplished in these directions may be quoted the inclusion in war of certain Territorial, units within Regular formations (thus economising in the provision of Regular units), the defence of vulnerable points b3^ National Defence Companies, the provision of officers from the Emergency Reserve and the Cadet Reserve, the provision of motor drivers* (Cabinet.20 (37), Conclusion 4)
9?^fcj iJ w*Continental Commitments22. It will be seen from paragraph 17 above what troops may be at our disposal, if the need arises, to go to the assistance of an ally in the defence of her territory. It should be emphasized that their equipment and war reserves will not be on the Continental scale. They should be despatched only if the situation in the rest of the world permits, and it would be necessary for the General Staff to review the whole field of possible action open to the enemy before this could be determined^, I suggest that it is of great importance that our potential allies should be left m no doubt as to the possibilities of direct assistance on our part and that the various alternative operations, whether in defence or in local offence, which our available reserves may have to undertake should be covered by any discussions or interchange of information which take place.Conclusion23. I feel it necessary to put the Cabinet in possession of the general trend of my proposals for the Army. I trust that they will commend themselves to my colleagues, who will, I hope, agree that on these lines we shall make the best use of the small Regular Army of 200,000 men, which I have assumed as the maximum number likely to be available in peace.Summary24. The following is a summary of my main proposals:  Home Defence(a) Air Defence (i) The formation of a separate branch of the Royal Artillery to man bothguns and lights of Regular anti-aircraft units, and of Coast Defences abroad (paragraph 3).(ii) Defence against low-flying attack to be met by organizing employees of factories, etc. (paragraph 4).(iii) Two Territorial divisions are at present employed in A.D.G.B. A furthertwo divisions would be needed to implement the full Ideal Scheme (paragraph 5). It is not recommended, unless the Cabinet in their review of priorities so desire, that the Ideal Scheme should be carried, at present, further than the stages already authorized (paragraph 6).(b) Internal Security. Since both Regulars and Territorials may have to assist in Internal Security duties in war, a measure of training is required (paragraph 7).(c) Coast Defence. Disproportionate expenditure on Coast Defence at Home is not desirable (paragraph 8).from the Company of Veteran Motorists and such bodies. There is no reason why women should not be engaged forthwith as part of the Army Reserve, so that on the outbreak of hostilities they can release individuals, and even the bulk of certain units, for inclusion in active formations. Such arrange-ments have never formed part of our War Establishments as conceived in peace.21. In making such proposals as these I have borne in mind that, being an industrial countiy, it would be inadvisable for us to divert from our own productive effort to the Army more personnel than is required to hold our defensive positions. But for an industrial country there is great advantage in so organizing the Army that employment in it maintains as close a relation-ship as possible with a man&apos;s normal avocations and interests.Therefore the money which is devoted to the Army can in the national interest, as well as with the best tactical effect, be spent on a high degree of mechanization with a minimum of skilled and, if possible, well paid personnel to direct and operate it.
Commitments Overseas(d) Our garrisons include 9 battalions who, under the Cardwell system, should be serving at home. To maintain 28 battalions in garrisons overseas, exclusive of India and Burma, is not easy. If resources were available about 2 Mobile divisions and the infantry equivalent of 3 divisions would be held on the spot or in close reserve (paragraph 11).(e) It is proposed to extend the system of locally raised units and to dilute certain Regular units with local personnel (paragraph 12).(/) The question of regional responsibility, or at least assistance by the Dominions, in peace in the defence of Imperial Communications should again be raised (paragraph 13).(g) India has accepted, conditionally, a number of commitments for the despatch of reinforcements (paragraph 14),.. but there are a number of questions which call for solution and it is recommended that conversations should be initiated between the India Office and the War Office with a view to reaching agreement (paragraphs 15 and 16).Present Resources(h) The war plan, so long as the present organization prevails, will allow for the despatch of 2 Regular divisions and a Mobile division, equipped for an Eastern theatre, in z -t 3 weeks; and 2 more divisions in z A- 40 days. A further 2 divisions will be equipped in z 4- 4 months and the remainder (up to ten in number), in z 4- 10 months (paragraph 17).Reorganization(i) It is intended to reorganize establishments so as to reduce the size of existing divisions and provide a larger number of more compact formations, in which fire power and mobility will be primary considerations (paragraphs 18 and 19). All possible steps will be taken to dilute trained Regular personnel, in war, by voluntary organizations (paragraph 20). The fact that we are an industrial country affects our organizations (paragraph 21).Continental Commitments(j) Our potential allies should be left in no doubt as to the possibilities of direct assistance on the part of the Army and in any discussions or interchange of information which may take place the whole strategical field should be covered (paragraph 22).L.
