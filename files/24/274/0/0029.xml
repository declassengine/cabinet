Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1938.SECRET. CP. 29 (38).CABINET.NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME, 1938.Memorandum by the First Lord of the A dmiralty.THE proposed new construction programme for 1938 is as follows : 3 Capital Ships 2 Aircraft Carriers7 Cruisers (4 of &quot;Fiji,&quot; 3 of &quot;Dido&quot; Class)8 Destroyers7 Submarines4 Small Minelayers2 Escort Vessels4 Minesweepers2 Patrol Vessels2 River Gunboatsand a number of miscellaneous vessels, viz. : 1 Destroyer Depot Ship 1- Submarine Depot Ship 1 Hospital ship Fleet Air Arm Supply and Repair Ship 5 Boom Defence Vessels (improved Dunnet) 2 Tugs13 Motor boats and miscellaneous small craft and motor boats.A table is attached to show the financial effect of these proposals. It is, however, necessary to say that the estimate of cost for Capital Ships and Cruisers may require revision should the reply to the enquiry now being made of the Japanese be unsatisfactory.2. These proposals follow strictly the policy approved for 1936 and 1937, and I had intended to put them forward with only a brief note. As, however, the Chancellor wishes substantial reductions to be made, I offer some general observations. I will not go into the technical reasons which have determined the composition of the programme, but I can assure my colleagues that it has received most careful consideration.3. The policy approved by the Cabinet for 1936 and 1937 was that we should speed up rearmament as much as possible, and in the summer of 1936 the First Lord was requested by a resolution of the D.P.R. to suggest methods of still further accelerating the Naval Programme. The present programme, therefore, represents the maximum effort possible, having regard to the needs of the other Services. In one respect it may be criticised as being too optimistic, for it is already clear that not much progress will be made with the third capital ship. Indeed, it will be possible to do comparatively little work on the capital ships in,/    [16707]aCopy No. 4 3
the financial year, owing to the need for designing new gun mountings, the gun calibre of which is to be increased from 14-inch to 16-inch. In spite of this, it has seemed desirable, for political reasons, to include the third ship.&apos; i 4. Nine months ago my predecessor laid before the D.P.P. proposals for iai new standard of naval strength, and he then made it plain to the Committee that, unless there was a fundamental improvement in international relations in the near future, those proposals represented the minimum consistent with naval security. The present construction programme does not commit the Government to the new standard. But, meanwhile, the international situation can hardly be said to have improved. Our relations with the most important Naval Power with whom we are likely to find ourselves in conflict have steadily deteriorated, and we have been compelled to contemplate the despatch of the Fleet to the Far East as a possibility no longer remote. Even since this programme was drawn up events in Germany seem to have rendered the outlook increasingly uncertain. Dictators faced by disaffection at home have, throughout history, turned to adventure abroad as the solution of their difficulties. In these circumstances, the position of a defence Minister in this country who was unable truthfully to assert that he was taking every step in his power to complete, and to hasten the completion of, his preparations for the worst eventuality would be most unenviable.(Initialled) D.
