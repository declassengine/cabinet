[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1938.SECRET.CP. 34(38). Copy No....5.^.CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.Release of Political Prisoners in India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a copy of a telegram sent to all Provincial Governors by the Governor-General on the 11th February laying down the policy to be followed by them if they are pressed by their Ministers, under threat of resignation, for an indiscriminate release of all their remaining political prisoners.2. The release of political prisoners was a prominent item in the Congress Party&apos;s programme when they fought the elections and when they took office, and the Ministers lost no time in bringing the matter before the Governors with the result that in most Provinces a number of the less important prisoners sentenced for crimes of a political nature have been released. The Governors have all along taken the line that they must examine each individual case on its merits in order to satisfy themselves that the release could safely be made without menace to the peace and tranquillity of the Province. Whenever possible also they endeavoured to secure that an undertaking should be obtained from the prisoners before their release that they would not repeat their offence. In some Provinces the Ministers have made no difficulty over this, but in others they have objected.3. No very serious difficulty arose over this question until in some Provinces the Ministers started to press for the release of persons convicted of serious crimes of a violent or terroristic nature, for which they had received long term sentences. The release of such prisoners in any of the other Provinces must obviously have considerable reactions in Bengal, where there is a large number (387 altogether) of terrorists in jail convicted of serious offences, in addition to about 250 detenus whose release has not yet been sanctioned. Any general release of these terrorist prisoners in Bengal would clearly be attended with the gravest danger, and it is important that nothing should be done elsewhere which would make it more difficult for the Ministers in Bengal to maintain their resistance to the demand for the release of these prisoners.4. The only Provinces other than Bengal where the question is now a live one are the United Provinces, Bihar and Punjab. In the United Provinces 14 political prisoners have so far been released and about 9 remain in jail; in Bihar 15 have been released and 26 remain in jail, while in the Punjab 20 have been released and 44 remain in jail. In the Punjab the Ministry, which is not a Congress one, has no intention of yielding to popular clamour and making any general release of their prisoners. In the United Provinces and Bihar, both the Prime Ministers at the end of last week approached the Governors and informed them that they were no longer prepared to be content with the present policy of a gradual release of these prisoners, but must press under a threat of resignation for the immediate release of all of them. They both explained that they would find it veiy difficult to face hostile criticism at the Congress session, which is to take place at Haripura at the end of this week, if they had not carried out their pledges to their supporters in this respect.5. For the reasons stated in the Governor-GeneraTs telegram, the matter has to be regarded from an all-India aspect, and not simply from a Provincial point of view, and from that aspect, taking into consideration the special position in Bengal, the Governor-General has found it impossible and I should add that I entirely accept his view to agree to any general release of these prisoners. He will, therefore, use his powers under section 126 (5) of the Act to instruct the Governors of the United Provinces and Bihar to refuse assent to their Ministries&apos; proposalsZ.India Office,14th February 1938.
Telegram sent to all Provincial Governors by Governor-General on 11th February 1938.In view of recent developments in the agitation for the releaae of terrorist convicts, I have thought it necessary to settle, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the policy to be followed, should Governors be pressed by Ministers under threat of resignation for indiscriminate release of such prisoners. I am now assured of full support of Secretary of State in this policy.2. Position is for the moment eased by Working Committee&apos;s resolution and by the calling-off of the hunger-strikes in Bengar and Bihar, although 21 prisoners remain on strike in the Punjab. It may, however, be anticipated that further attempts will be made to force the-hands of the Governors in Congress Provinces, where it is difficult to argue that release of their comparatively few prisoners would greatly affect local security, and Governors would therefore be in a comparatively weak position in invoking their special responsibilities. To yield, however, in such circumstances would greatly increase the pressure on non-Congress Ministries, among whom Bengal hold 387 such convicts and Punjab 44. There is good reason to suppose that Bengal Ministry would find, it impossible to maintain their present firm attitude and would feel bound to make similar proposals, and resulting situation would involve serious risks of breakdown in that Province. Punjab Government have also indicated their intention of standing firm against the demands for release, and their position must therefore be considered. It is clear, therefore, that policy must be decided on all India and not local considerations, and position of non-Congress Governments cannot be compromised for the sake of Congress Ministries.3. I realise that policy of standing firm as regards general release may possibly lead to a major crisis in the United Provinces and Bihar. But I am doubtful whether any Ministry will resign on this issue, and, in any case, if we accept the risk and decide to stand firm we must be prepared to see the matter through whatever the consequences may be. If, on the other hand, we give way on this issue there is, I think, an increased probability that Congress Ministries will think they can force our hands on the other issues, and that we shall be confronted later with an equally acute crisis on some quite different point for example, the pay of the Services. My feeling, however, is that. Congress will force a crisis whenever it suits them and not before, and that any concessions made under pressure will therefore be of no ultimate value as against abandonment of principles of primary importance.4. In the event of a liunger-strike being resumed, or continuing where it exists, it is, of course, impossible to consider cases of individual hunger-strikers, even on their merits, until strike is abandoned unconditionally. Any concessions to hunger-strikers would mean an end to discipline in jails and would seriously weaken the sanctions of law. I am, indeed, inclined to regard general demand for indis-criminate release of &quot; political&quot; prisoners as part of general Left Wing policy of eliminating all sanctions which might be a deterrent to revolutionary activities in future.Moreover, in considering any policy of release we have to guard against dangerous idea that execution of any sentence of law in any way depends on political sympathies of party in power. Even in the absence of hunger--strike, therefore, there can be no promise of any immediate release of such prisoners on a large scale. But, subject to these reservations, there continues to be no objection to considering possibility of releasing such prisoners as can be released without serious risks to peace,having due regard to circumstances of each individual, the conditions prevalent in the Province concerned, and effects on other Provinces. This, in fact, was the line which had hitherto been taken with Congress Ministries and to which it was proposed to adhere unless hunger-strike had made question acute. I still hope that, by taking a firm stand against indiscriminate releases and urging that no case has been made for any other solution than gradual and discriminating release on above lines, Governors may themselves be able to induce Congress Ministries to restsatisfied with this solution, more especially if Ministries do not ultimately intend to resign on this issue. I am aware, however, that where local considerations alone do not warrant a breach between Governor and Ministers on this issue, the ultimate
sanction for this policy must rest on the use of my authority under section 126 (5), and, although I do not wish this fact to be mentioned to Ministers unless Governor can gain his point by no other means, I am quite prepared to use my powers of intervention if this is clearly the only solution.5. To sum up, the policy which in my judgment we must adopt is the following : (a) No surrender to hunger-strikes; (6) no indiscriminate or general releases ; (c) in considering particular releases, account must be had both of conditions in the individual Provinces and of circumstances of individual cases, and of wider extra-Provincial reaction.I see no objection, so long as there is no question of action being taken under threat of a hunger-strike, and so long as it is taken after due consideration of reactions in other Provinces in consultation with me, to release in driblets of individual prisoners whose release cannot be regarded as constituting a grave menace to peace and tranquillity of a particular Province and in respect of whom, ex hypothesi, no general responsibility of mine under 126 (5) would be attracted. It would be disingenuous not to place on record at the same time the obvious fact that a state of affairs in which political prisoners in every Province except Bengal had without exception been enlarged, bringing to bear, as it inevitably would, very strong indirect pressure on the Government of Bengal, wordd have to be considered in relation to the situation in that Province, and that circumstances might arise in which, even though on consideration of individual case and in the light of reactions of his particular Province a Governor would not feel that his own special responsi-bility was attracted, I should still feel bound to instruct the Governor under 126 (5) that, having regard to wider situation, I could not agree to enlargement.I think that, in practice, the danger of such a situation arising is unlikely to be great, for, while certain Provinces, e.g. Bihar, may have no prisoners other than those who satisfy the criteria in, preceding sentence, at this stage at any rate in other Provinces (e.g. the case of Sadashiv in Bombay or certain of the prisoners detained in Punjab) those criteria would not be satisfied and there would, as I see it, be no immediate prospect of a general and complete all-India release in Provinces other than Bengal. In other words, while ail Provinces will probably consider carefully in the light of my present telegram the extent to which they can adopt a policy of the individual examination of cases aud of the weeding-out, with such a degree of delay as may be practicable in their individual conditions, of prisoners, and while in certain Provinces at present holding &quot; political&quot; prisoners the result of such examination may after a relatively short interval be the enlargement of all those at present detained, taking the situation over India as a whole, circumstance in which Bengal, which is the point of primary importance at this stage from general point of view, would find itself isolated in retaining prisoners of this category is unlikely to be reached in the near future, and position as a whole can be re-examined as figures of prisoners still in jail in other Provinces show a diminution.6921Wt 8177/RDP 8   85   2.38
