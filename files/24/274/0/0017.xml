CABINET.THE -STABILISATION OF RATES OF CHARGE IN THE ROAD HAULAGE INDUSTRY.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.Motor goods vehicles are subject to the licensing system set up by the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1935-      This Act, which was based on the recommendations of the Final Report of the Royal Commission on Transport, and the Report of.the Salter Conference, aimed at promoting stability in the haulage industry itself, and co-ordination between transport by road and other forms of transport, particularly the railways *2.     While the licensing system has undoubtedly done much towards- remedying the evils against which it was directed, the position is still far from satisfactory.      Despite the efforts of the Traffic Area Licensing Authorities, faulty maintenance of vehicles, long hours of driving and exploitation of-workers, with their undesirable reactions upon road safety, are still prevalent. As my colleagues will be aware, a Bill (based on the recommendations in the Report^ of the Committee of which Sir James Baillie was Chairman) is to be introduced this session by the Minister of Labour dealing with the question of wages in the road haulage industry.     The control of. wages is an essential step towards securing a stable economy in the industry;    but it will not touch the owner driver, nor will it eliminate &quot;rate-cutting&quot; which lies at the root of most of the evils to which the industry is subject. It is necessary to protect the haulage industry and the railway companies from the cut-throat competition of irresponsible road operators.      If the road transport industry is to be placed on a^Report of the Committee on the Regulation of Wages andConditions of Service in the Road Motor Transport Industry (Goods).     Presented to Parliament, May 1937, and printed (OMD. 5if40).     The Minister of Labour submitted a Memorandum (CP. 293(37)) on the matter to the Cabinet, and the conclusions of the Cabinet thereon are set out in Conclusion 9 of Cabinet k-G (37), held on the 8th December, 1937.
1-73satisfactory footing, both internally and in relation to other forms of transport, the rates charged must be on a proper basis.J.     The Transport Advisory Council55 which was set up by Section 4-6 of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1953, have recently presented me with a Report on Service and Rates, a copy of which is annexed to this Memorandum.     After considering memoranda from national associations representative of transport by road, rail, canal and coastwise shipping, the Council came to the following general conclusions (pp. 2 - 8 of the Report):(i)    there should be an unfettered right on the part of thetrader to select the form of transport which he approves and which is most convenient and economic for his purposes;(ii)    it is impracticable to dictate that certain goods should go by certain forms of transport; (iii)    all forms of public transport should, where practicable,be rate-controlled; (iv)    the co-ordination of rates between the different formsof transport will best be achieved by voluntary agreement;(v) the internal organisation of the Road Transport Industry is an essential preliminary to further progress towards co-ordination.4-.     The steps which the Report recommends to secure stability in the haulage industry are (a) the regulation of wages and (b) the regulation of rates of charge.(a)-   As regards wages, the Council express agreement with the suggestions of the Baillie Committee.the present Chairman of the Council is Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen and the Council includes eight representatives of users of the roads, three of railways and four of water-borne traffic, as well as three representatives of labour, five of trading interests and six of local government.
- (b) As regards rates, the Council consider that road hauliers should he afforded an opportunity of &quot;building up a rates structure for their own industry and to this end recommend;-(i) the appointment in each of the twelve Traffic Areasof an Area Rates Committee, composed of representatives of the. industry, to agree rates for its Area; (ii) approval or modification of these agreed rates by an Area Rates Officer, appointed by the Minister; (iii) a right of appeal against Area Rates Officers&apos;decisions to a Road Rates Tribunal of three persons, one experienced in the road haulage industry, one experienced in trade, and an independent Chairman; and(iv) publication of the approved rates and enforcement of their observance by any necessary prosecutions in the Courts and by suspension of the carrier&apos;s licence in the cases of persistent or wilful breach. The proposed machinery also provides for representations by traders as well as by hauliers and means for adjustments, e.g., where services run in more than one Area.5.     The representatives of Labour on the Council formally recorded dissent from the Report (p. vi) on the ground that its proposals will not solve the problem of the co-ordination of Transport Services, but are primarily designed for rate fixing. In their view national ownership of the means of public transport offers the only real solution of the problem.G,     The Report has been well received by the road haulage industry and has had favourable comment in the trade and general press.      Its publication has probably afforded considerable relief to hauliers in general, who feared some more drastic approach to the problem.7.     The Report provides for a somewhat elaborate machinery (including a new Tribunal) but deliberately refrains from laying down any guiding principles by which to fix rates for carriage by
1i.-   J+   -road and leaves any measure of co-ordination of such road rates with those of ether forms of transport to later voluntary action. The adoption of these proposals may well (at least at first) stabilise rates at the level of present charges of the more organised operators, rather than produce a comprehensive rate structure.guiding principles as the problem is reviewed from time to time by the Area Committees, the Hates Officers and the Tribunal;    but stabilisation of rates reached in this manner may tend to prejudice the application of uniform and scientific principles at a later stage, and, had we been starting with a clean sheet, I should have looked to the Council to propound -a more complete and a more scientific scheme.8.     While giving full weight to the considerations set out in the last paragraph, I have nevertheless reached the conclusion that the only practicable course is to accept the Council&apos;s Report in principle for the following reasons(i )   the Council&apos;s proposals should provide a workable scheme which will go some way to check the evils to which I refer in paragraph 2 and to further a wider co-ordination of transport facilities in the future; (ii)    any attempt to introduce legislation on a different basis or to impose a rate structure on the industry from above would raise serious difficulties of a practical and political character; (iiij   the Report has been prepared by a statutory body appointed the Council evidently look to the gradual evolution ofto advise me on all questions relating to the coordination of transport.To reject their advice savefor imperative reasons of public policy might seriously prejudice their co-operation in the future;the Report represents a large measure of practicalagreement between road and rail operators and it wouldbe unwise to jeopardise this new-found harmony;
1(v)    the scheme should cause the minimum disturbance to theroad haulage industry or to the trades which utilise itscomprehensive scheme which suggested the application of predetermined principles in the fixing of rates in an industry in which they have hitherto been unregulated and largely haphazard;    and (vij   with the co-orjeration of the industry the scheme ofcontrol can be applied expeditiously to the checking of rate-cutting which is the greatest existing obstacle to a healthy condition of the industry. 9.      In these circumstances I seek the approval of my colleagues to an early announcement that the Government accepts the Report of the Transport Advisory Council in principle, and proposes, in due course, to introduce legislation accordingly. I shall then he in a position to consult the Organisations interested and to determine a numher of points of detail which are not covered by the Council&apos;s Report hut which must be settled before a Bill can be prepared.services.Grave disquiet might result from a more(Intld. )     E.L.B.Ministry of Transport.28th January,  1Q7;8.

PREFATORY NOTE BY MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT.The Transport Advisory Council was appointed as the result of a recommendation in the Final Report of the Royal Com-mission on Transport of the appointment of a permanent Advisory Council on transport &quot; Because of the continually changing nature of conditions and in order that the Minister may have at his disposal the best advice available.&quot;&apos;&apos; The principal duty of this Advisory Council should be to study transport problems both in the country generally and in particular areas and to advise the Minister as to the action which he might usefully take to promote the co-ordination, improvement and development of transport generally. We think that the Council would be concerned mainly with matters relating to the carriage of goods, since questions of passenger transport are for the greater part already provided for under the new system of Area Traffic Commissioners. . . . We think that by means of sug-gestion and persuasion the Advisory Council might be able to bring about a co-ordination of transport facilities which might not otherwise be possible.&quot;Effect was given to this recommendation in the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 46 of which enacts that:  &quot; For the purpose of giving advice and assistance to the Minister of Transport ... in connection with the discharge by him of his functions in relation to means of and facilities for transport and their co-ordination, improvement and development, there shall be constituted a council, which shall be called &apos; the Transport Advisory Council &apos; . . . &quot;The Council, understanding that it was the intention of the Minister that they should not confine their activities to matters specifically referred to them, but should also examine on their own initiative the broad issues of transportation problems, appointed in July, 1935, a Programme Committee to consider the best method of investigating, and the order in which they should be examined, various questions which the Royal Corn-mission on Transport or the Salter Conference f had suggested for investigation by the advisory body which they had pro-posed. This Programme Committee, in November, 1935, recommended the appointment of a Committee to investigate the subject of &quot; Service and Rates &quot; in relation to goods traffic* Cmd. 3751 of 1936, published by H.M. Stationery Office, price 4s., paragraphs 504 and 505.t Report of Conference on Road and Rail Transport. 55-170 of 1932. Published by H.M. Stationery Office, price is. 3d. net.
borne by rail, canal, road and coastwise shipping; and added that the first part of the investigation should be into the road transport industry.A Committee of Investigation was accordingly appointed by the Council in December, 1935, consisting of 16 members of the Council, as indicated by asterisks on page iv; at the request of the Committee, and on the recommendation of the British Road Federation, the Minister appointed Mr. J. H. Turner to be an additional member.The Report of this Committee which is printed in this volume (together with various Appendices) was adopted by the Trans-port Advisory Council on the 22nd July, 1937. Messrs. Bevin, Marchbank and Spence asked for their dissent to be recorded, on the ground that the proposals in the Report do not solve the problem of the co-ordination of Transport Services, but are primarily designed for rate fixing; in their view national owner-ship of the means of public transport offers the only real solu-tion of the problem.In a covering letter the Council intimated to the Minister that the measures indicated in the Report were by no means final in their scope (drawing especial attention to their final para-graph on Coastwise Shipping), but expressed the hope that they might prove fruitful and lead to further developments in the direction of co-ordination.Ministry of Transport. October, 1937.
REPORT ON SERVICE AND RATESI.-TERMS OF REFERENCE.Our terms of reference were to investigate the subject of &quot; service and rates &quot; in relation to goods traffic borne by rail, canal, road and coastwise shipping, in the light of the Report of the Programme Committee of the Council, which was pre-sented on 15th November, 1935, a material passage of which was:  &quot; It is clear that the councils wish is that these investiga-tions shall be in the nature of preliminary groundwork to enable the Council ultimately to judge the extent to which it may be possible to formulate practical principles upon which co-ordination between all forms of transport carry-ing goods can be achieved and developed. It is essential, therefore, that those who are charged with the duty of making the investigations shall keep before them con-stantly and prominently the end in view . . . &quot;II.-MEETINGS.We have had ir meetings. In addition, a Sub-Committee has held four meetings.III.-EVIDENCE.A request for constructive suggestions on the matters raised in the Programme Committee&apos;s Report was circulated to the national associations representative of the different forms of transport, and memoranda were received from the following:  the four Main-line Railway Companies;the Canal Association;the Grand Union Canal Company;the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom; andthe British Road Federation^Supplementary statements were also furnished at a later stage by the Canal Interests and the Coastwise Shipping Interests.IV.-PROCEDURE.Following consideration of these memoranda our Chairman drew up a series of questions with a view to focusing discus-sion. After considering these questions, we have come to the following general conclusions:  (i) that, with a view to avoiding unnecessary overlapping of services and uneconomic competition, it is desirable to establish as great a degree of co-ordination as possible among the various forms of transport engaged in the* See Appendices I-V, pages 13 to 60.
carriage of goods, so as to ensure that each form of trans-port is used to the greatest national advantage;(ii) that the best line of approach to achieve co-ordina-tion is to aim at securing for traders adequate alternative facilities, care being taken that the resultant competition is on fair terms; and(iii) that there should be an unfettered right on the part of the trader to select the form of transport which he approves and which is most convenient and economic for his purposes.V.-SERVICES. It is, therefore, our view that any attempt to dictate services and to endeavour to decide that certain goods should go by cer-tain forms of transport would be impracticable, and would cer-tainly not be tolerated by public opinion. We hold that all forms of transport should, where practicable, be rate-controlled, with publication and non-discrimination, in order to ensure a fair basis of competition, and we proceed on the assumption that, if the rates charged are stabilised within each form of transport and voluntary agreements are then concluded between the various forms of transport, the greatest possible degree of co-ordination will be secured, since each form of transport will tend to carry those traffics to which it is best suited. In this we are in agreement with the view expressed by Mr. Oliver Stanley, then Minister of Transport, who said on the Third Reading of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933:  &quot; I believe it is far better that this kind of co-ordination, which has got to come, should come through the voluntary effort and the voluntary agreement of the transport interests concerned.&quot;VI.-RATES.It is noted as regards rates that:  (1) railways are now controlled by an elaborate rate structure, subject to the power, to grant exceptional rates within certain limits, and to arrange agreed rates subject to a certain control from the Railway Rates Tribunal. The coastwise shipping interests, however, wish to record that the control over railway rates from a competitive point of view is not regarded by Coastwise Shipping as effective, and they submit that the economic control of coastwise rates is more effective than the statutory rate control over rail-way rates;(2) the canals are to a very limited extent subject to maximum rates, except for such traffic as is conveyed by bye-traders;(3) coastwise shipping is not controlled as regards rates, but unlike other forms of transport is subject to foreign competition; and(4) the road hauliers are not controlled as regards rates.
^1VII.-ROAD AND RAIL SUB-COMMITTEE.It appeared to us that our first step in investigating the co-ordination of rates should be in regard to road transport, and a Sub-Committee, consisting of the Chairman and the members directly connected with rail and road transport interests, was set up to consider this question with a view to arriving at the greatest possible measure of agreement, in the light of the above conclusions which the Committee had already reached.After referring to these, the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, which we have adopted, was in the following terms:  &quot; Report of the Road and Rail Sub-Committee. &quot; The discussions of the Sub-Committee have gone to show that the institution of a Central Rates Tribunal at the present time would be premature, but that substantial agreement could be reached in the following respects:  &quot; (i) The internal organisation of the Road Trans-port Industry must be regarded as an essential pre-liminary to further progress; and&quot; (ii) The stabilisation of wages, working conditions and rates within the Road Industry requires to be dealt with before serious progress can be made in its relation to other forms of transport.&quot; Recommendations. &quot; (i) Wages. As regards wages and working condi-tions, the report of the Baillie Committee was published on 4th May.&quot;)&quot; Without having gone into details we may say that we concur in the general trend of its recommendations, including those as to enforcement, and hope, subject to the necessary detailed consideration, that effect will be given to them by the legislature at the earliest possible moment. It would be very desirable to fix some reasonable time limit within which the suggested machinery should become effec-tive. The settlement of this question will be a great step forward; indeed no real co-ordination as between Road and Rail would be possible without it.&quot; (2) Rates. As regards rates, it was felt that before proceeding further, opportunity should be afforded for the road hauliers to build up a rates structure for their own industry. In this connection it must be remembered that nothing of the kind exists to-day, and that the industry has always found it exceedingly difficult to create a satisfactory organisation owing to the fact that it is divided into such* i.e. a Tribunal dealing with the rates of all forms of transport.t Report of the Committee on the Regulation of Wages and Conditions of service in the Road Motor Transport Industry (Goods) cmd.. 5440 of 1937.   Published by H.M. Stationery Office, price is. od. net.
a large number ot separate units. It should therefore be given time to create its rates structure. Such structure should be the product of the Industry itself and the rates should be arrived at in relation solely to factors affecting Road Transport, rather than by attempting to relate them to rates prevailing in other forms of transport. It should be based as far as possible upon agreement between road hauliers holding    A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; licences.&quot; Your Sub-Committee would not wish to see imposed upon the Road Industry a cast-iron system of rates which could not be altered, but feel rather that the road rates structure as a whole should be elastic, and, subject always to provision for consideration of the views of the trading community, should be capable of adjustment by simple and quick procedure. There must, however, be suitable machinery for enforcement of the agreed road rates as between road operators themselves.&quot; (3) The steps we recommend to secure these results are:  &quot; (a) Area Rates Committees. That Statutory Area Rates Committees, consisting of representatives of the industry, be set up in each Traffic Area. The exact method for the appointment of the Cornmittees should be a matter for discussion between the Minister and the industry. These Committees should agree rates for their own areas. Where services extend beyond one area, the Committees of the areas concerned should jointly agree the rates.&quot; (b) Area Rates Officers. In view of the very wide field to be covered, Area Rates Officers, whose areas should correspond with those of the existing Traffic Commissioners, should be appointed by the Minister of Transport. It should be the business of the Area Rates Officers to approve, with or without modification, schedules of agreed rates put before them by the Rates Committee in their area; also, failing agreement, to fix a schedule of rates which they consider appropriate. . (See paragraph 5 below.) Where rates have been agreed between two or more Area Committees the rates should be approved by the Area Rates Officers con-cerned sitting jointly.&quot; (c) Road Rates Tribunal. Finally, a Road Rates Tribunal for the whole country should be set up, con-sisting of a representative of the Road Industry, a representative of traders and an independent chair-man. It should be the duty of the Tribunal to deal with matters affecting more than one area, where the Area Rates Committees have been unable to reach
agreement; and to hear appeals from the decisions of the Area Rates Officers; its decision on matters of rates, charges and conditions of carriage should be final.&quot; (4) Traders&apos; Interests. It will be necessary to provide facilities to enable trading interests to be heard in connec-tion with any proceedings before the Area Rates Officers or the central Road Rates Tribunal. For this purpose it will no doubt, as in the case of the Railways, be necessary to give public notice of the matters coming before the Area Rates Officers and the Road ,Rates Tribunal for their decision.&quot; (5) Road Rates Structure. With regard to the exact field to be covered by the road rates structure in the first instance, it was felt that this was a matter calling for further detailed investigation. It would probably be desirable to consider the exclusion of certain types of transaction, if only from the point of view of limiting the volume of work to be covered in the initial stages. The types of transaction in mind were those in which individual features were so varied and represented such a proportion of the total cost as to make uniformity of bases impracticable. It was felt that the decision as to the types of such exemption might well be a matter for the Tribunal.&quot; (6) It was felt there should be provision that if a com-prehensive road rates structure on the lines above contem-plated was not set up within a reasonable period to be fixed by the Minister, it should be the duty of the Minister, after consultation with the Road Rates Tribunal either (a) to recommend a further period for agreement, or (&amp;) to in-struct the Road Rates Tribunal to settle the rates structure itself in the light of such advice as it might be able to get from the Area Rates Officers and the Area Rates Com-mittees.&quot; (7) Additional charges may be allowed on recognised lines for additional services, for detention, special handling, etc. Reductions in the agreed schedule of rates should only be made by application to the Area Rates Officer. Some simple procedure should be devised for hearing and dis-posing of such applications without delay where they re-ceive the recommendation of the Area Rates Committee. Failing this recommendation, full opportunity should be given to hearing any opposition to such reductions from other road hauliers. It is considered, however, that in the case of rate reductions, it is unnecessary to make special provision for protecting the interests of traders. Where it is proposed to increase rates, the procedure should be on the same lines, subject to provision being made for traders&apos; interests to be protected.
&quot; (8) Publication of Rates. We are agreed that ade-quate steps should be taken to ensure the publication of Road Rates and to prevent discrimination or undue prefer-ence.&quot; Provision should be made for the published rates to be conveniently available to traders, the general public, and other carriers.&quot; Apart from the availability of agreed road rates for inspection at the offices of the Road Rates Tribunal, etc., individual hauliers should be required to keep at their offices a record of rates charged by them whether under the ap-proved scales or otherwise; and such records should be open for inspection by interested parties.&quot; (9) Enforcement of Rates. Where a rate has been approved by an Area Rates Officer or by the Road Rates Tribunal it should be made a condition of his licence that a haulier should convey such traffic only at that rate. Any deliberate or repeated breach of this condition should be punishable in the same way as breach of any other statutory condition attached to a licence, i.e., by prosecution in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction in the first instance, or in case of wilful or frequent breach by revocation or suspension of the licence.  Minor cases could be dealt with by warning.&apos;&apos; The duty to warn or prosecute should lie with the Area Rates Officer, in view of the fact that he would be in touch with all the circumstances of the rate fixing machinery, and could avail himself of the advice of his Area Rates Com-mittee, and in view of the necessity for keeping the enforce-ment of these decisions in the same hands as their con-firmation. It would be open to operators or to the Area Rates Committee to bring to the notice of the Area Rates Officer any breaches of the established rates of which they were aware.&quot; (10) Modifications of Road Licensing. Subject to the putting in hand of the legislation and organisation necessary to cover the foregoing points and some provision to ensure that finality is reached without unreasonable delay, the Railway members felt that a very substantial extent of agreement could be reached with the Road interests on cer-tain matters raised by the latter in respect to the working of the 1933 Act.&quot; This included readiness on the part of the railways to agree to a longer currency period for road licences and to accept transfers, mergers, etc., as more or less matters of formality.&quot; As to the currency period of licences, it was noted that a Bill was now before Parliaments and appeared likely* This Bill received the Royal Assent on 6th July, 1937.
to be passed, which would enable the Minister to extend the time by regulation.&quot; With a view to eliminating further points of friction the Railway members would be prepared to meet road in-terests to discuss the possibility of minimising opposition to licence applications, and further to join in a full inquiry at a future period (say four years hence, or earlier if the road rates structure has been completed) as to the whole question of opposition to licences by other forms of carriage.&quot; (n) Road and Rail Rates Agreements. It was sug-gested that as regards the. general inland transport problem the relationship between the Road and Railway carrying interests and their respective rates was by far the most important single factor.&quot; It was agreed that as early as practicable conferences should be held either centrally or in the Traffic Areas, be-tween representatives of the railway companies and the road hauliers with a view to making voluntary agreements as to rates.&quot; The railway companies did not ask that there should be any form of compulsory agreement between Road and Rail in this respect, but preferred that any agreement as to rates should be entirely voluntary, and the Road mem-bers were in agreement with this view. The agreements thus made should be terminable at reasonably short notice by either party. They would then lapse until replaced by a new agreement.&quot; If an agreement of this kind involves modification of the schedule of rates approved for the Roads, it will be necessary to obtain fresh assent from the Area Rates Officer or the Road Rates Tribunal. The Railway Companies will have to take whatever steps are prescribed under the exist-ing law for the sanction of any changes proposed in their own rates.&quot;Further Questions. The Sub-Committee also considered cer-tain other questions which had been submitted to them and they reported as follows:  i. that they did not favour the idea of a compulsory association embracing all road hauliers;2. that in view of the procedure envisaged for establish-ing road rates they considered: - (a) that the question of the basis on which rates should be fixed, whether on the principle of what the traffic can bear, or on the cost of service in each case, or on a combination of both, did not arise;(&amp;) that the division of road hauliers into long-distance and short-distance hauliers would be imprac-
3- that the obligation to obtain a carrier&apos;s licence is re-lated not to congestion on the roads, but rather to the use of roads which are public property. The railway repre-sentatives stated they could not accept, at the present time, the view that licences should be withheld only on grounds of non-observance of rates and other conditions, but re-ferred to the statement of their views at the end of para-graph 10 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report;4. that if rates, where agreed, are to be enforced on a basis of non-discrimination, it would be redundant to im-pose a &quot; common carrier &quot; obligation on road operators;5. that the question whether it is desirable to make any change in the law with regard to &quot; C &quot; licences is ade-adequately covered by the Report of the Baillie Committee.Conclusion of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report. The Sub-Committee^ Report concluded as follows:  &quot; The foregoing suggestions are of necessity of a very general character, but endeavour has been made to carry them far enough to indicate the principles upon which the two interests on the Sub-Committee consider useful pro-gress could best be made, and in the carrying out of which both sides should be able to work together in an atmosphere of helpfulness and goodwill.&quot; Clearly, detailed provisions and procedure will call for very much further investigation in the course of which those representing the various sections of transport or trade con-cerned should have full opportunity of presenting their views.  The purpose for the moment is rather to obtain the reaction of the main Committee to the broad general principles here submitted by the Sub-Committee, and which indicate sufficiently clearly the steps which the Sub-Com-mittee feel are most likely to result in early progress towards a solution of the whole problem under consideration.&quot; The Chairman wished to record his appreciation of the con-ciliatory and friendly way in which the Road and Rail repre-sentatives met each other with the evident intention of smoothing over difficulties and arriving at a real, measure of co-operation.VIII.-SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE ROAD INTERESTS REGARDING THE WORKING OF THE ROAD AND RAIL TRAFFIC ACT, 1933.As noted in paragraph VII, the object of the Road and Rail Sub-Committee was to ascertain the points upon which agree-ment could be reached by the two sides.Upon a number of very important points they were able to reach complete agreement.
There are, however, other points urged by the Road members and mentioned in Section 2 of the Memorandum submitted by the British Road Federation to the Committee which, while they were not considered to be matters suitable for discussion with the Railway members on the Sub-Committee, are none the less felt to have an important bearing upon the internal stabilisation of the Road Industry.In addition to the question of wages and working conditions already referred to, these points include the need for better observance of driving hours and rest periods, of speeds and safe loading, and various other matters in which the 1933 Act or its administration is suggested to affect adversely the well-conducted and efficient road operator, upon the fair treatment of whom is felt to rest the hope of the proper internal organisa-tion and stabilisation of the Road Industry a process which the Committee has indicated it regards as a necessary preliminary to co-ordination with other forms of transport.Doubtless opportunity will be afforded to the Road Interests to urge these matters in the correct quarter, and reference is made to them here because of the intimate relationship which, in the view of the Road members, they bear to the problems under consideration by this Committee.IX.-APPLICATION TO OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORT.In the light of these suggestions bearing on road and rail transport, we proceeded to investigate how far the principles underlying them could be applied to other forms of transport, with a view to devising a general scheme of co-ordination.X.-CANALS.1. We are of opinion that the most profitable line of develop-ment for securing greater co-ordination of rates in the canal industry, appears to be by applying to that form of transport a system similar to the one outlined above for the Road Haulage Industry, i.e., a system which, after providing for the protection of traders&apos; interests, gives legal sanction to voluntary rates agreements in that industry.2. Canal Rates Structure. The Canal Interests are willing to adopt the principle of a compulsory rates structure, to be achieved by giving legal sanction to voluntary agreements. They have already in existence a large body of agreed rates covering a great many traffics. The scheme which we propose involves:  (a) that a Canal Rates Tribunal consisting of an inde-pendent Chairman, a representative of Canals, and a repre-sentative of Traders, should be set up, by whom the
proposed rates should be confirmed with or without amend-ment after hearing representations from traders regarding these proposed rates. It would not be necessary to appoint Area Rates Officers for canals, in view of their much greater stability of rates and the relatively few carriers concerned;(6) that penalties should be imposed in cases of non-observance of approved rates;(c) that special provision should be made, as in the case of road transport, for exceptional traffics. It was agreed that a compulsory rates structure would involve the recogni-tion of a fair wage obligation. It was not felt that there would be any necessity to impose a licensing system to secure the enforcement of a rates structure in the case of the canals.3. Scope of the Structure. This canal rates structure should extend to statutory waterway proprietors who are carriers, and companies owning fleets, who provide carrying services for hire or reward. The &quot;Canal representatives suggest that it should not at present extend to those canal carriers who own and work their own craft. Such exemption should, they consider, be con-fined to bond fide owner-Captains owning not more than one boat or a pair of boats in the case of those not exceeding 7 feet in beam, and whose boats are bond fide their own property, or the subject of some deferred payment agreement still current. We understand that in many cases they only carry for one or two firms and that they do not carry a large bulk of traffic. We are of opinion that it would be very difficult to enforce agreed rates upon them. But we feel that fuller information should be obtained as to the number of these carriers and the work that they are doing or likely to do in the future before we can definitely recommend their exemption from the rates structure.Those trading companies who own their own fleets for the&quot; purpose of their own business alone, and may be compared with &quot; C &quot; licensed road hauliers, would naturally be left outside the rates structure.4. Rail-Canal Agreements. In view of these conclusions, we felt it would not be profitable to pursue further the suggestions that an independent chairman should be appointed to the present Rail-Canal Conferences, and that the Rail-Canal Agree-ments should be given statutory form.5. Collection and Delivery Services. As regards the sugges-tion that in dealing with any question of rate control on road-borne traffic, the collection and/or delivery services carried out by the canal carriers should not be the subject of such control, but that charges for collection and /or delivery should merge in the through rate, where the service is provided by the canal
carriers&apos; own vehicles, it is noted that this question will arise with the railways as well as with the canals, and it was agreed that it could well be left for discussion by the Road Area Rates Committees when they come to settle rates. &quot;Tiris understood that no objection will be raised to bond fide water carriers secur-ing the services of road vehicles belonging to recognised Road Hauliers on such terms as may apply.6. Differential Rates. We note that the Canal Interests are also concerned that the principle of differentiating between water and rail rates should be adequately protected; this principle is referred to in paragraph 6 of the Rail-Canal Agreement, and has been approved by Parliament in the Trent Navigation Act, 1932, Section 51 (2). In view of the procedure envisaged, this question will not arise until the much later stage at which each agency has completed the stabilisation of its own rates structure.XL-CONFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF TRANSPORT.We recommend that as regards the voluntary conferences to be held between Road and Rail, envisaged by the Sub-Commit-tee&apos;s Report, and other voluntary conferences between the various forms of transport, all Transport Interests who are them-selves rate-controlled by statute or who have themselves accepted the principle of rate control within their own industry, should be notified of meetings and should be entitled, if they considered themselves interested, to attend and to express their views. In connection with these voluntary conferences, the establishment of a Central Rates Tribunal covering all forms of &quot;transport may require fresh consideration at a later stage.XII.-COASTWISE SHIPPING.We have now laid down the principles upon which we hope it will be possible to reach a large degree of co-ordination be-tween the Rail, Road and Canal Interests, and which, while putting an end to unnecessary and uneconomic competition between these three forms of transport, will provide the trading public with an adequate supply of alternative facilities. It has not been possible for us to deal with coastwise shipping in this Report, but we hope to present a second Report dealing with this at an early date. Coastwise shipping differs in many respects from the other three forms of transport, and it is necessary that we should make further inquiries and obtain fuller information concerning it before attempting to make definite proposals. We shall have, to consider further, whether the adoption of a statu-tory rate control for coastwise liner shipping would strengthen their position inter se or advance co-ordination between the
several transport services, and we recognise the inherent diffi-culties in operating a rate structure in the coastwise tramp trade. We shall also have to consider the submissions which have been made by the representatives of coastwise shipping upon the alleged harmful effect of rail and road competition upon their branch of transport and their representations alleging the inade-quacy of the protection afforded to it as regards rates in the Railways Act, 1921, and the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933. We are fully aware of the importance of the industry, both from the trading and the national point of view and of the need which therefore exists of taking no steps which would be detrimental to its interests.2,2nd July, 1937.A.

APPENDIX I.MEMORANDUM FROM THE FOUR MAIN LINE RAILWAY COMPANIES 7th September, 1936.1. The railway companies are invited to submit to the Transport Advisory Council such constructive suggestions as they can make towards the formulation of practical principles upon which the transport of goods by rail, road, canal and coastwise shipping can be co-ordinated.2. The railway companies are in full sympathy with the object which the Council has in view. They are anxious to promote co-ordination and a friendly spirit of co-operation among all transport agencies for the best service of the public. Co-operation of such a character must, as the Council indicates, rest upon equitable conditions such as will enable each branch of transport to function efficiently within its own sphere and as part of a comprehensive whole. The railway companies have no reason to depart from the view that any solution of the problem must rest upon the establishment of equitable conditions natural conditions must, of course, differ thereafter allowing each branch to find its level, under a system of reasonable co-operation framed to avoid wasteful competition.3. It may be helpful at the outset to tabulate the. statutory conditions in which each of the four forms of transport is conducted, and a statement is accordingly appended4 to this memorandum which shows how :ruch more strictly the railways are regulated than other forms of trac; wrt. particularly in regard to charges and conditions of carriage.4. This regulation of railway charges has been imposed by Parliament from time to time over many years and was re-enacted and strengthened so recently as 1921 in accord with the wishes of the trading public, which is served by the railways. In a considerable degree it is a survival of the system of control from less competitive days, and in particular from a period when road transport was not able to offer an effective alternative form of conveyance for practically all traffics and all destinations.Throughout this period the conditions applied to rail and road trans-port charges were unequal, but the effect was unimportant and is still unimportant where motor transport has replaced the horse vehicle for local services. However, as motor traction by road has gradually grown to its present dimensions, covering nearly all traffics ana1 all parts of the kingdom under a system of unregulated charges, the inequitable position as between rail and road calls for reconsideration of the conditions governing the commercial conduct of each.The railway companies suggest, therefore, that as a first step considera-tion should be given to the regulatory changes which would be necessary in order to establish the equitable conditions visualised by the Council. This primary step to co-ordination does not necessarily imply either that the statutory conditions governing each form of transport should be identical or that the conditions now applicable to one form of transport should be applied to all.5. It is hardly necessary to refer in detail to the various enquiries and statutes which have endorsed and required the present railway rates structure and the controls thereof, including those relating to publication and non-discrimination.The chief factors in this structure are:  (a) A comprehensive classification of all merchandise and a system of rates and charges based thereon, including through rates applicable over the lines and steamship services of the four main line companies throughout the whole of Great Britain.
(b) The laws relating to undue preference and publication of rates.(c) The  laws  relating  to  appeals  to  the  Courts  in  regard to reasonableness of charges or against proposed increases.So far as the railway companies can ascertain the majority of the trading interests of the country do not desire fundamental alterations in the railway rates structure and regard the general effect of its practical application as productive of trading stability.In the circumstances the railway companies do not ask to be exempted from these obligations, which they consider not inappropriate to a public service, but they think it reasonable to ask that their competitors on the roads should now also accept the position of a public service, with the regulations appropriate to the type of service which they offer. At present traffic is diverted from the railways by competitors who have full knowledge of the rates quoted by the railways, whilst their own rates are, or can be, veiled in complete secrecy. In the same way, road hauliers are in a position to carry at any rates that suit their interest at the moment without any obligations, such as are incumbent on the railways, to extend the favour to other traders forwarding in similar circumstances. It would appear reasonable to argue that if such legislative restrictions on the freedom of one transport agency are beneficial to the public, they are likely to be beneficial also in the case of their competitor.The acceptance of the obligations of publicity and non-discrimination is, in the opinion of the railway companies, a step essential to the building up of any stable and equitable system of co-ordination.6. If these proposals are acceptable, the course would seem to be clear for constructive measures for the development of schemes of co-ordination between road and rail transport, but before approaching the subject further, the railway companies think it would prove helpful to review the relations at present existing between themselves and the principal trans-port agencies other than roads.(a) Railway and Coastwise Shipping. In 1929 an agreement was entered into between the railway companies and the coasting liner companies with the object of promoting co-operation. It provided for the setting up of a standing committee of railway goods managers and shipping company directors or managers, and also of local con-ferences in the various areas affected. The aims of the local con-ferences were to agree rates for the carriage of general merchandise and livestock between ports and places in Great Britain, in which both the parties were interested, to use their best endeavours to avoid reductions in rates to an uneconomic level, and to take measures appropriate to meet competition. Provision was made that in the event of disagreement at a local conference the matter should be referred to the Standing Committee.The agreement was revised in July, 1934, so as to avoid any difficulty arising out of Section 39 of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, which provides in certain circumstances for a review of agreed charges and exceptional rates competing with coastwise shipping.The machinery of co-operation has worked smoothly, and there has for a number of year been a considerable measure of co-ordination between the railways and the coasting finer companies.The position of the railway companies in relation to coastal tramp shipping is less satisfactory. The conditions of operation of tramp steamers are so irregular and their ownership so varied that no effective co-operation has so far been found possible.(b) Railways and Canals. In 1933 an agreement was entered into between the railway companies and the Canal Association similar to
the agreement with the coastal liner companies. It provides for the setting up of a central conference between the railway goods managers and representatives of the Canal Association and of recognised associa-tions of bye-traders, and is designed to promote co-ordination, to eliminate undue competition, and to avoid reductions in rates to an uneconomic level. The central conference is empowered to set up local conferences which have power to agree rates by rail and canal. In the event of disagreement at a local conference the matter may be referred to the central conference for decision.This machinery of co-operation has on the whole worked smoothly, and the effect of the agreement has been to limit the extent of waste-ful competition and uneconomic rate-cutting.7. Railways and goods road transport. As to the nature of the machinery by which co-ordination between rail and road might be effected, it is perhaps natural that the railway companies should examine the possibility of making arrangements similar to those already existing between themselves and the other two forms of transport canals and coastwise shipping. They are encouraged to do so by the words used by Mr. Oliver Stanley during the passage of the Road and Rail Traffic Bill in 1933 in reference to the agreement between the Railway Companies and the Canal Association:&quot; The basis of the agreement seems to be an admirable one. It is a basis of local and central conferences between the canals and the railways at which these matters of charges can be discussed, and where you may get some proper division of functions between the two. It is that kind of arrangement between the competing transport elements which one hopes will develop as a result of the work of the new Transport Advisory Council which is to be set up.&quot;*8. The arrangements with the Canal Association and the Coastal Liner companies are purely voluntary, and have worked satisfactorily because the parties are adequately organised and in a position to secure fulfilment of the terms of the agreement. The situation would be more complex in the case of road transport because of the great number of operators, large and small. As between rail and road, therefore, it would be essential not only that each of the parties should be concerned to secure due observance of the law and a universal standard oi conduct appropriate to a public service, but that agreements should be supplemented by legislation which would make them effective; and an official tribunal would be required to act as a court of appeal on any matters of dispute.9. Assuming acceptance of the principles which the railway companies have submitted as necessary for the establishment of equitable conditions of competition, the railway companies would be prepared to proceed to consider in detail with the road hauliers the terms on which machinery, with legislative hacking, might be set up to effect co-ordination between rail and road.Such discussions would probably be f ocussed on three main points:   (a) Arrangements for setting up, possibly through the medium of central and local conferences, a system for the agreement of schedules of charges on a basis which would recognise, amongst other things, the value of the commodities conveyed, with provisions for the application and variation of such charges under legislative sanction, to be applied by an authoritative body empowered for the purpose.(6) The application to road traffic of appropriate conditions of carriage, including the principles of publication of rates and non-discrimination with possible variations of the present law governing* Official Report of Standing Committee &quot; A &quot;, House of Commons, 5th July, 1933 -Col. 597.
rail traffic and provision for combined rail and road traffic or alloca-tions of traffic between the two means of transport.(c) Complementary arrangements with other forms of transport. 10. The proposals submitted in this memorandum are not inconsistent with the suggestions already made to the Committee.(a) As regards the suggestion that there should be a distinction between short distance and long distance road hauliers, and that a system of rate control should be applied only to the latter, if it is the general belief of the Council that it is undesirable and unnecessary for public road transport operating within limited areas to be under any obligations as regards publication of rates and non-discrimination, the Railway Companies would not object. They would, however, consider it reasonable that they themselves should have similar freedom in respect of corresponding services.(6) A Rates Tribunal as proposed would serve, amongst other things, as the Appeal Tribunal mentioned in paragraph 8 of this memorandum. The Railways Act, 1921 (S. 24) and the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933 (S. 39), contain precedents according to which the Railway Rates Tribunal could be augmented to deal with matters other than railway rates.(c) The Railway Companies note the view that there should be no interference with the ancillary user, and interpret this in the sense that there should be no restriction on &quot; C &quot; licence vehicles as to area of operation or class of goods to be carried.   The Railway Companies have no positive proposal to put forward on this matter, but they suggest that consideration will have to be given to the position of &quot;C &quot; licence vehicles, other than those engaged on local distribution (which represent the great majority), in relation to any machinery governing the rates of public transport. 11. In   submitting   their   suggestions   the   Railway   Companies   have thought it advisable to state them as shortly as possible, and at this stage to postpone all detailed description of the proposals put forward.   Whilst they feel strongly that changes along the lines here indicated are already urgently required in order to hasten the co-operation of transport for the general benefit of national industry, they appreciate that on matters of detail there may be other alternatives which would be equally worthy of consideration, and they would wish it to be understood that they hold themselves in every way ready to examine such alternatives without prejudice to the general line of policy which they herewith submit to the Council.ANNEXE TO APPENDIX I (See page 13, para. 3).Statement of comparative conditions affecting the Transport of goods by Rail, Road, Canal and Coastwise Shipping.RAILWAY COMPANIES. 1. Power to Provide Services. Railway Companies may provide any number of services on their existing railways.   New railways, however, cannot be made without statutory authority if the making or operation of them conflicts with any public or private rights.In addition, the approval of the Minister of Transport is required to the opening of:  (1) any additional line of railway, deviation line, station, junction, or level crossing directly connected with a railway used for the public conveyance of passengers, or(2) any railway adapted for electric traction (Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 41).
189j- U uRailway Companies are empowered by statute (Special Acts, 1928) to operate road transport services subject to the provisions of the general law with regard to such services; but they may not manufacture any part of any road motor vehicle other than the body (Section 7) and the Minister of Transport must report to Parliament if in his opinion the interests of the public are prejudicially affected by such powers (Section 13 of the Act).Railway Companies require statutory authority to operate air services or steamers.   They may not manufacture aeroplanes.2. Obligation to Carry. At Common Law.The Railway Companies have chosen to undertake generally the pro-fession of common carrier except in a very few classes of commodities. Common carriers must:  (a) carry goods for all persons who offer to pay them for such carriage, provided that these are goods which they profess to carry; and(6) insure the safe delivery of any goods with which they are entrusted for carriage. Their liability at common law is modified by the Carriers Act, 1830, and so far as Railway Companies are concerned, by the Standard terms and conditions of carriage made by virtue of the Railways Act, 1921.The protection of the Railway Companies under the Carriers Act, 1830, now only applies to goods the value of which exceeds  25, and no longer applies to silk.It extends, however, to carriage by water in railway-owned vessels (Railways Act, 1921, Section 56 and 5th Schedule).By Statute.Railway Companies are required:  (1) to afford all reasonable facilities for the receiving, forwarding and delivering of traffic (Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854, Section 2);(2) to afford such reasonable facilities, services and conveniences upon or in connection with their undertakings as the Railway and Canal Commission may order in the interests of:   (a) the public safety; (6) the public;(c) of trade;(d) of any particular locality.The Railway and Canal Commission may require Railway Companies to provide alterations, extensions and improvements not exceeding /ioo,ooo in any one case (Section 16, Railways Act, 1921);(3) to conform, if the Minister of Transport upon the advice of the Statutory Committee so requires, gradually to standardisation of plant and equipment, and to adopt, upon a similar requirement by the Minister, schemes of co-ordination in user of rolling stock work-shops and plant unless the Company concerned can show that it would prejudicially affect their stockholders to do so (Section 16, Rail-ways Act, 1921);(4) to carry mails, if required so to do by the Postmaster-General (Railways (Conveyance of Mails) Act, 1838);(5) to allow the Government to take possession of railroads in case of emergency (Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871);(6) to provide cheap conveyance for H.M. Forces by train (Cheap Trains Act, 1883);(7) to give precedence to Government traffic on occasion of national danger or emergency (National Defence Act, 1888);(8) to provide private sidings (Railways (Private Sidings) Act, 1894)..
o(A) Standard Charges and Exceptional Rates.Standard charges for the carriage of goods in the classification are fixed by the Railway Rates Tribunal (Railways Act, 1921, Section 32).In fixing such charges, the Tribunal are required to have regard to the means which in their opinion are best calculated to ensure the maximum development and extension of carriage by railway in the public interest (Section 58 (2)).No variation either upwards or downwards may be made from such charges except by way of an exceptional rate (Section 32, Railways Act, 1921) or an agreed charge (Section 37, Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933).Exceptional rates in existence before the appointed day could be con-tinued if either not less than 5 per cent, below standard rates, or agreed in writing between Company and Trader, or following agreement, deter-mined by the Tribunal, but if more than 40 per cent, below the standard rate, they had to be determined by the Tribunal (Section 36).All new exceptional rates must be reported to the Minister of Transport (Railways Act, 1921, Section 37).No exceptional rate of more than 40 per cent, below standard rate may be operated without the consent of the Railway Rates Tribunal (Section 37, Railways Act, as amended by Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 40).No exceptional rate fixed by the Tribunal may be increased or can-celled without the sanction of the Tribunal or may be reduced more than 40 per cent, below the standard rate without the Tribunal&apos;s consent.Any reduction of less than 40 per cent, below the standard rate must be reported to the Minister.Any exceptional rate not fixed by the Tribunal may be increased or cancelled on notice to Traders, but in the event of objection the altera-tion must be determined by the Tribunal (Railways Act, 1921, Section 38, as amended by Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 48 and 3rd Schedule).The Minister may refer any exceptional rate to the Rates Tribunal if he is of opinion:  (a) that it will be prejudicial to any class of user;(6) that it will jeopardise the realisation of the standard revenue. The Tribunal may hear representations on rates from:  (a) any Railway Company;(b) any representative body of Traders;(c) certain Public Authorities;(d) persons or associations certified by Board of Trade (Section 78, Railways Act, 1921);(e) bodies properly representative of harbours, shipping and canals (Section 39, Railways Act, 1921; Section 39, Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933).(B) Agreed Charges. A charge may be agreed with a Trader in accordance with the provi-sions of Section 37 (1) of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, which might otherwise be an undue preference, provided that:  (a) it is approved by the Railway Rates Tribunal as reasonable and necessary;(6) opportunity for objection has been given to any Trader or interested representative body of Traders;(c) an exceptional rate cannot adequately secure the same results;(d) it may be reviewed by the Railway Rates Tribunal;
(e) any Trader who regards an agreed charge as detrimental to his own business may apply to have a similar charge fixed for his own merchandise;(/) opportunity for objection is given to Dock and Harbour Authori-ties and bodies representative of coastwise shipping (Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Sections 37 and 39);(g) it is reported to the Minister within 14 days of its sanction and remains available for public inspection in the prescribed manner (Section 37 (11), Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933).(C) Ancillary Charges.A reasonable sum may be charged to certain services not otherwise pro-vided for by the Railways Act, 1921, Section 55 arid 5th Schedule.(D) Through Rates by Land and Water.Railway Companies must provide through rates by land and sea wherever they provide, use or work their own vessels (Section 47, Railways Act, 1921).(E) Publication of Rates. Printed copies of Classification and Schedule of Standard Charges must be kept for sale at such places and reasonable prices as the Minister may direct.There must he kept for public inspection during reasonable hours with-out payment of any fee at each station or place at which merchandise is received a copy of the Classification and a Rate Book stating:  (i) the chargeable distance from that station or place of every place to which the Company book;(ii) the scales of standard charges applicable to each class of mer-chandise conveyed on the railway;(iii) all exceptional rates in operation from such station or place;(iv) any charges in force for the collection and delivery of mer-chandise at such station or place.Where the carriage is partly by land and partly by sea in Companies&apos; vessels, Rate Books must be kept at the British ports showing the rates by sea and distinguishing the proportions of rate appropriate to the land and sea transit respectively.There is a penalty of not exceeding  5 for any failure to comply with the above mentioned provisions (Railways Act, 1921, Section 54).(F) Review.The Rates Tribunal must review the Standard and Exceptional Rates annually (unless the Minister of Transport gives directions to the contrary) and in doing so must have regard to the means best calculated to ensure the maximum development and extension of carriage by railway in the public interest and must be satisfied that the railways are being economically and efficiently managed.If the Standard Revenue is found to have been exceeded, the Tribunal may modify the Rates so as to effect a reduction of the future net revenue to an extent equal to 80 per cent, of such excess. By this means only 20 per cent, of the excess would go to the Companies and the remaining 80 per cent, would be applied in reduction of charges.In the event of the net revenue being less than the standard revenue the Tribunal may increase the Standard and Exceptional Rates (Railways Act, 1921, Section 59).
Such rates may also be modified by the Tribunal on similar lines on application at any time of a Railway Company, trader or local authority (Sections 35 and 78).The Tribunal must review Exceptional Rates competitive with Canals, if the matter be referred by the Minister on application by canal interests (Section 39).The Tribunal must review Agreed Charges and Exceptional Rates com-competing with Coastwise Shipping (Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 39).(G) Equality.Rates must be at all times charged equally to all persons in respect of all goods of the same description passing between the same points under the same circumstances (Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, Section 90).Exemption from the above is, however, given in respect of Agreed Charges (Road and Rail Traffic Act, Section 37).k 4. Preference.No undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to or in favour of any particular person or Company or any particular description of traffic in any respect whatsoever must be made or given.No particular person or Company or particular description of traffic must be subjected to any undue or unreasonable preference or dis-advantage in any respect whatsoever (Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854, Section 2, and Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888, Section 27).Exemption from the above is, however, given in respect of Agreed Charges (Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 37).5. Conditions of Carriage.Standard Terms and Conditions of Carriage settled by the Railway Rates Tribunal apply generally except in the case of:   (a) passengers&apos; luggage, and(6) merchandise in respect of which a special contract has been made (Section 44, Railways Act, 1921).This special contract remains subject to the alterations imposed by the Railway and Canal Traffic Acts, 1854 and 1888, i.e. it must be just and reasonable and signed by the party with whom it is made.6. Accounts and Statistics. Railway Companies are required to prepare full accounts. Returns and Statistics in statutory form and forward copies to the Minister of Trans-port under penalty for non-compliance (Railway (Accounts and Returns) Act, 1911; Railways Act, 1921, Section 77 and 8th Schedule; Regulation of Railways Act, 1871, Section 9, Railway Regulation Act (Returns of Signal Arrangements, etc.), 1873; and Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888, Section 32).Railway Companies are bound to treat their road transport services as a subsidiary or ancillary business within the meaning of sub-section 6 of Section 59 of the Railways Act, 1921, and prepare separate accounts in connection therewith for submission to the Railway Rates Tribunal at the time of the periodical review (see Head 3 (F) and Railway Road Transport Acts, Section 12).Railway Companies must also render accounts and statistics to the Minister in a similar manner to those which they must render in respect of railways (Railway Road Transport Acts, Section 14).
7. Safety Requirements.Railway Companies may be ordered by Minister of Transport to adopt block system, interlocking of points and signals and continuous brakes. The Railway and Canal Commission may enforce the order (Regulation of Railways Act, 1889, Sections 1 and 2).The approval of the Minister of Transport referred to in (1) regarding the opening of new lines will not generally be granted unless the require-ments for passenger lines and recommendations for goods lines of the Minister of Transport in regard to railway construction and operation are fulfilled. (See Requirements for Passenger Lines and Recommendations for Goods Lines of Minister of Transport in regard to Railway Construction and Operation.   Published by H.M. Stationery Office, 1928, is. od.)8. Inquiries into Accidents.Railway Companies are required to notify the Minister of Transport on the following accidents :  (1) Any accident attended with loss of life or personal injury to any person whatsoever.(2) Any collision where one of the trains is a passenger train.(3) Any passenger train or any part thereof accidentally leaving the rails.(4) Any other accident specified by Order of the Minister of Transport.(Regulation of Railways Act, 1871, Section 6; Railway Employment Prevention of Accidents Act, 1930, Section 13; and Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 43.)The Minister of Transport may (and generally does) direct an inquiry to be made into the cause of any accident of which notice is required (Regulation of Railways Act, 1871, Section 7).The 1935 Report of the Chief Inspector of Railways shows the following particulars of Accidents on the Railways of Great Britain during the year 1934:-Number of train accidents    ...      ...      ...      ... 810Inquiries into train accidents ...       ...       ...       ... 11Other inquiries   ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 5Total casualties in train accidents     ...      ... -f killed.1       073 injured.Total casualties in all railway accidents      ... I       371 killed.* \ 22,229 injured.ROAD HAULIERS. 1. Power to Provide Services.No person may use a goods vehicle on a road for the carriage of goods:  (a) for hire or reward;(b) for or in connection with any trade or business carried on by him,except under a licence (Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933). Licences are of three kinds.&quot; A &quot; or public carrier&apos;s licence (two years&apos; duration). &quot; B &quot; or limited carrier&apos;s licence (one year&apos;s duration). C&quot; or private carrier&apos;s licence (three years&apos; duration). &quot; A &quot; or &quot; B&quot; licences are issued at the discretion of the Area Licensing Authorities.&quot; C &quot; licences are issued on demand by the same Authorities except where applicants character is in issue, where the Licensing Authority has a discretion.
&quot; A &quot; and &quot; C &quot; licences are granted subject to statutory conditions:  (a) that vehicles arc in a fit and serviceable condition;(b) that any statutory speed limit, weight and loading restrictions are complied with;(c) that provisions of Section 19 of Road Traffic Act, 1930, relative to drivers&apos; hours are obeyed;(d) that statutory provisions concerning keeping of records are obeyed.&quot; B &quot; licences are granted subject to the above conditions and the Licensing Authority may in addition apply further conditions: - (a) that vehicles are only used in a specified district or between specified places:(b) that only certain classes of goods are carried;(c) that goods are only carried for specified persons;(d) such other conditions (not being conditions respecting rates to be charged) as the Licensing Authority may think fit in public interest and to avoid uneconomic competition.Licences are granted in respect of numbers of vehicles of certain tonnage, not in respect of routes.   They can be varied on application.Objection may be made by persons already providing facilities, whether by road, railway, sea, canal or air, for the carriage of goods for hire and reward in the district or between the places which the applicant intends normally to serve, on the ground that:  (a) suitable transport facilities are or would be if application were granted, in excess of requirements;(6) any of the conditions of the licence held by the applicant have not been complied with. Holders of  &apos; B &quot; licences have not the right to object to the applicant for an &quot; A &quot; licence, unless they also hold &quot; A &quot; licences.The Licensing Authority may hold public inquiries in order to exercise his functions under the Act (Section 11, Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933).There is a right of appeal from his decision to the Appeal Tribunal set up under Section 15 of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933.Road Operators may, if they wish, operate steamer services or aeroplane services without any statutory authority whatever.2. Obligation to Carry.The majority of present day motor hauliers have not chosen to assume the obligations of common carriers at all.They do not, as a class, hold themselves out to carry goods for the general public, even though many of them hold &quot; Public Carriers &quot; or &quot; A &quot; licences under the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933. Even where they carry on a general haulage business without specialising for particular customers, they generally pick and choose their loads, and a &quot; haulier who invites offers of goods for carriage by his vehicles, but accepts or rejects them according as the rate, destination or class of goods is or is not satisfactory, is not a common carrier &quot; (see Belfast Ropework Company v. Bushell, 1918, 1 K.B. 210).Such carriers do not insure the safe delivery of the goods which they carry or accept the liabilities of the common carrier.The larger road transport concerns, a number of which are controlled by the Railways, have always assumed the obligations of common carriers.Omnibus Companies, who compete considerably with the Railway Com-panies for passenger traffic, do not profess to be common carriers of pas-passengers&apos; luggage, although they do allow considerable quantities of luggage on their vehicles, but they are not similarly liable for the safety of such luggage.Road hauliers are under no similar obligations.
There is no control of road rates, nor any requirements as to publication.The Licensing Authorities established under the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, may at their discretion require the applicant for a licence under that Act to submit to them in the prescribed form (inter alia) &quot; such particulars as the Licensing Authority may require with respect to any business as a carrier of goods for hire or reward carried on by the applicant at any time before the making of the application and of the rates charged by the applicant &quot; (Section 5 (2), Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933).(There is no form specially prescribed for information which the Licensing Authority could require on rates, but use could presumably be made of Question 3 of Form G.V.4 (Particulars of Interest, &quot;A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; Licences) made by virtue of Schedule II of the Goods Vehicles (Licences and Prohibitions) Regulations, 1936. Question 3 is worded &quot; any other particulars the Licensing Authority may require &quot;.)It is not known to what extent, if at all, the Licensing Authorities have in fact made use of this opportunity of acquiring information concerning rates.While the Licensing Authority may have regard to information regard-ing rates in considering whether to grant or refuse an application for a licence, he cannot control rates charged by any person to whom he has issued a licence. In the case of &quot; B &quot; licences, conditions with respect to the rafes to be charged are specifically excluded from those conditions which the Licensing Authority may think fit to impose in the public interest and with a view to preventing uneconomic competition.In the case of &quot;A&quot; licences, the Licensing Authority cannot attach any conditions, except the statutory conditions contained in Section 8 of the Act of 1933.4. Preference. 5. Conditions of Carriage.Road Hauliers are under no statutory limitations with regard to the contracts which they make with their customers for the carriage of goods. A Road Haulier can make any conditions he likes with his customer, and it does not matter how unreasonable those conditions are&apos;; nor is it neces-sary for the customer to sign them, so long as knowledge of their existence can be brought home to him in some other way.Even if the Road Haulier does not make any special conditions with his customers, he is, generally speaking, for the reasons set out above, not liable as a common carrier, but only liable for his own negligence, and that of his servants within the scope of their employment.6. Accounts and Statistics. The  holder  of  a  licence  must  keep   in prescribed   manner  records showing:  (a) hours of work performed by drivers of vehicles; (6) particulars of each journey made,  greatest weight of goods carried, description and destination of goods carried. These records must be produced to any properly authorised person if required, and they must be preserved for six months, and for a further six months if required to do so by a properly authorised authority.No returns need, however, be made to the Minister or the Licensing Authority (Section 16, Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933).(Contrast this with position of road passenger operators who must make financial and statistical returns to the Minister in the manner prescribed by the Road Traffic Act, 1930, Section 75.)
7- Safety Requirements.By Section 8 (i) of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, it is a condition of every licence for a goods vehicle that the authorised vehicle is main-tained in a fit and serviceable condition, and that any statutory provisions as to speed and weight and loading of goods vehicles are complied with.Certain speed and weight limits have been applied (see First Schedule, Road Traffic Act, 1934, and S.R. &amp; O., 1931, No. 4). Also general safety requirements (see Orders made under Road Traffic Act, 1930).There are no regulations concerning maximum loads.It is an offence to load a vehicle in such a manner or to allow a vehicle to operate in such condition that danger will be caused or is likely to be caused to any person on a vehicle or trailer or on a road (Regulation 62, S.R. &amp; O., 1931, No. 4).8. Inquiries into AfcciDENTS.Inquiries into road accidents may be held by the Minister by virtue of his powers under Section 23 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930.They may be held in public, but any report made cannot be used in evidence in subsequent legal proceedings.From inquiries made, it appears that the Minister does not regard his powers under this Act in a similar light to those under the Regulation of Railways Act, 1871.The Inspector into a railway accident apportions blame. The Inspector into a road accident does not, as this is regarded as the function of the police.The object of an inquiry under Section 32 of the Act of 1930 is to dis-cover whether any technical defect in construction of vehicles and roads can be obviated, and they are consequently regarded more in the light of an investigation than a formal inquiry.Some hundreds of investigations into accidents have been made by the certifying officers of each Traffic Area since 1931 (when the Road Traffic Act came into operation) of which no returns are made, but the number of formal inquiries has been very small.The Home Office return of 28th March, 1935.- shows the following par-ticulars of road accidents involving personal injury:  1934-Number of road accidents       ...      ... ... ... 204,710Inquiries into road accidents ...      ... ... ... None.Investigations by certifying officer ... ... ... No returns issued.Total casualties f     7,343 kUled-total casualties     ...............^ 232,325 injured.CANAL COMPANIES. 1. Power to Provide Services. Canal Companies are entitled to provide services for the carriage of goods on their canals.   With one or two important exceptions they do not in practice exercise this right, and the carrier services are provided by independent firms generally. known as bye traders.2. Obligation to Carry.Where the canal company act as carrier they are subject to the general law as to common carriers and they are also obliged under the Railway and Canal Traffic Acts to afford all reasonable facilities for the receiving, forwarding and delivery of traffic.The general law as to common carriers also applies to bye traders who profess to carry for all comers, but they are free from any statutory -regulation as to the facilities they provide.
253. Charges.The charging powers of canal companies are regulated by Provisional Orders made under the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888. These Orders fixed maximum scales of tolls which have been increased by post-war legislation. Maximum scales of charges for the carriage of goods, similarly increased, are also provided for cases in which canal companies act as carriers of goods.Bye traders enjoy the benefit of the maximum scales of tolls for the passage of their barges, but are themselves entirely free from statutory regulation as to the charges which they make to the public.Under Section 39 of the Railways Act, 1921, Canal Companies are given the right to complain to the Minister that they are detrimentally affected by exceptional rates granted by the Railway Companies, and the Minister may refer the matter to the Rates Tribunal for review, whereupon the Rates Tribunal may vary or cancel the rates complained of.4. Preference.The provisions of the Railway and Canal Traffic Acts prohibiting undue preference apply to canal companies, but bye traders are not subject to similar regulations.5. Conditions of Carriage.Section 7 of the Railway &amp; Canal Traffic Act, 1854, applies to canal companies acting as carriers and by that section the canal company are liable for loss or injury to goods occasioned by their neglect or default unless they are protected by a special contract signed by the person sending the goods and containing conditions which are adjudged by the court to be just and reasonable.Bye traders are subject to no regulation as to the conditions on which they carry goods.6. Accounts and Statistics. If required by the Board of Trade every canal company must make such returns as the Board of Trade may require showing the capacity of the canal for traffic and the capital revenue expenditure and profits of the canal company (Section 39, Railway &amp; Canal Traffic Act, 1888).7. Safety Requirements. ;If the Board of Trade are informed that the Works of any canal are in such a condition as to be dangerous to the public or to cause serious inconvenience or hindrance to traffic, they may direct one of then-officers to hold an enquiry and inspection and report thereon to the Board of Trade (Section 41, Railway &amp; Canal Traffic Act, 18 &quot;8. Inquiries into Accidents. There is no statutory provision for these as presumably there is no need for them.COASTWISE SHIPPING. 1. Power to Provide Services. A ship owner is free from restriction as to the services he provides.2. Obligation to Carry. The general law as to common carriers applies to carriage by sea. There are no statutory obligations as to the facilities provided by ship-owners, unless the ship is owned or worked by a railway company. In the latter case the Railway &amp; Canal Traffic Acts apply and the railway company is obliged to afford all reasonable facilities for the receiving, forwarding and delivery of traffic.
There is no statutory regulation of the charges of ship owners except in the case of ships owned by railway companies.Section 30 of the Railway Clauses Act, 1863, applies where a railway company is authorised by any Act incorporating that Act to own or work steam vessels and contains provisions for securing equality of treatment for all persons and prohibiting any reduction in tolls in favour of any person in consequence of his having travelled on the company&apos;s railway.Many of the private Acts authorising railway companies to work steam vessels contain provisions regulating charging powers.By Section 53 of the Railways Act, 1921, it is provided that any railway company whose powers of charging in respect of the conveyance of passengers and their luggage in steam vessels are limited by statute may demand such reasonable fares as it shall think fit and any question as to the reasonableness of such fares shall be determined by the Rates Tribunal.Where railway companies in respect of their railways are in competition with coastwise steamers for the carriage of traffic, although the coastal ship owner is entirely free from control as to the rates which he charges, the competing railway company are subject to restrictions imposed upon them by Section 39 of the Road &amp; Rail Traffic Act, 1933. This enact-ment provided that the coastal ship owner may object to any agreed charges or exceptional rates which are being made or charged by a rail-way company in competition with coastal carriers on the ground that such charges or rates (a) would place coastal carriers at an undue or unfair disadvantage;or(6) are inadequate having regard to the cost of affording the service. The Minister of Transport may refer such objections to the Railway Rates Tribunal, who, after hearing the parties, may cancel or vary the railway company&apos;s agreed charges or exceptional rates.4. Preference.There are no statutory restrictions against preference except for railway companies owning ships in which case the Railway &amp; Canal Traffic Acts prohibiting undue preference apply.5. Conditions of Carriage. The law in respect of the carriage of goods by sea is now governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924. This Act adopts certain rules which were agreed at an international conference on maritime law. Under these rules certain liabilities are imposed upon the ship owner and, on the other hand, he is given the benefit of certain immunities. Stated shortly, the effect of these provisions is that the ship owner is bound to exercise due diligence to man, equip and supply the ship and to make it seaworthy. He would also be liable for negligence in the loading, handling, stowing and carriage of the goods. On the other hand, he is relieved from responsibility for damage resulting from unseaworthiness (not due to his negligence) or from negligence in the navigation or management of the ship, fire (not caused by the actual default or privity of the carrier), strikes or lock-outs, saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, or any other cause arising without the actual fault or privity of the carrier or his servants. It is also provided that the carrier shall not in any case be liable for loss or damage in an amount exceeding  100 per package or unit.It is provided that any agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier from liability for negligence shall be void. This last provision, however, does not appear to apply to coastwise vessels, the owners of
* See footnote, page 15 above.which are at liberty to enter into any agreement in any terms as to their responsibility and liabilty in respect of goods carried.The result in the case of coastwise vessels appears to be that the ship owner may make any special contract limiting his liability and in addition he is entitled to the immunities which are afforded by the Act.6. Accounts and Statistics. Ship owners are under various Acts obliged to supply information and returns to Government Departments in connection with customs, aliens and other matters, but are not required to furnish accounts and statistics of their revenue expenditure and traffics.7. Safety Requirements. An elaborate code of safety provisions is contained in the Merchant Shipping Acts.8. Inquiries into Accidents. Full provisions for inquiries into accidents are also made in the Merchant Shipping Acts.APPENDIX II.MEMORANDUM FROM THE CANAL ASSOCIATION.-29th September, 1936.This Association has fully considered your letter of the 20th March and has conferred thereon with the National Association of Canal Carriers.It is probably within the knowledge of the Transport Advisory Council that during the progress through Parliament of the Road and Rail Traffic Bill, 1933, an Agreement was reached between the four Amalgamated Railway Companies and this Association for the setting up of Local Area Conferences and a Central Conference to consider questions of rates and other matters on which the interests of the Railway Companies on the one hand and the Canal Undertakers and Canal Carriers on the other hand might be in conflict and in the hope that a full discussion of such questions at these Conferences would result in the elimination of uneconomic competition.The then Minister of Transport, when speaking before Standing Com-mittee &quot; A &quot; on one of the amendments to Clause 29 of that Bill which Clause dealt with the agreed charges of Railway Companies and became Section 37 of the Act, referred to the said Agreement and stated:  &quot; The basis of the Agreement seems to be an admirable one. It is the basis of Local and Central Conferences between the Canals and the Railways at which these matters of charges can be discussed, and where you may get some proper division of functions between the two. It is that kind of arrangement between the competing transport elements which one hopes will develop as a result of the work on the new Transport Advisory Council which is to be set up. I am sure that no one would wish to challenge, or in any way to upset the first and important attempt of two of these competitors to work together, and not in the most acute competition. I think the fact that the Canal Association, which represents all the most important under-takings, are satisfied with this Agreement, and do not now believe that Clause 29 can be used in a way detrimentally to their business, should satisfy the Committee that the amendment which we are now discussing is no longer necessary. &quot;*
The general opinion of the members of this Association who are repre-sented on the Conferences established under the said Railway-Canal Agree-ment (except the Grand Union Canal Company and the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company) and of the members of the National Association of Canal Carriers is that the Conferences established under the Agreement have worked satisfactorily and have achieved a considerable measure of co-ordination as between rail and water transport.This Association and the National Association of Canal Carriers therefore feel that when dealing with the wider aspects of co-ordination referred to in your letter of the 20th March it will be best to proceed in the first instance on the lines of voluntary arrangements.In this connection it may be interesting to recall the further statement with reference to the Railway-Canal Agreement made by the then Minister of Transport on the Third Reading of the Road and Rail Traffic Bill, 1933, when dealing with the said Clause 29 of that Bill:  &quot; I believe it is far better that this kind of co-ordination, which has got to come, should come through the voluntary effort and the voluntary agreement of the transport interests concerned. I hope the Bill will not only make a start on the work of that problem but will be of,some assistance to them in bringing it to a successful conclusion. I am certain, that, if these interests are unable or un-willing to reach co-ordination by their own efforts, this House, sooner or later, whatever their political opinions, will be forced to take by Act of Parliament powers beside which the powers of this Bill will seem pale and ineffective.&quot;This Association and the National Association of Canal Carriers are of the opinion that a wide measure of competition in transport services on economic lines is essential to progress in transport and that any tendency to create monopolies or restrictions on traffic routes will tend to reduce the efficiency of the services provided and force the trader to provide his own transport wherever possible and that the interests of traders should not be ignored.The object of voluntary co-ordination should be to secure the provision of such efficient services and choice of services at agreed differential rates that the trader will prefer to hand his traffic to the expert transport operator in one or other available form of public transport than to provide his own transport.With a view to bringing about co-ordination by voluntary arrangements this Association puts forward the following proposals, which are also generally approved by the National Association of Canal Carriers:  1. The establishment of Local Area Conferences representing recognised Associations of Railway Companies, Road Hauliers, Canal Undertakers, Canal Carriers and Coast-wise shipping.This Association considers it essential that Canal Carriers as well as Canal Undertakers should be represented on these Conferences. 2. The chief objects of the Local Conference should be:  (a) to consider and regulate rates and charges for the carriage of, and services in connection with, merchandise traffic by means of agreed Schedules of rates and charges differentiated between the different forms of transport according to the nature and extent of the services provided, the conditions, on which the traffic is offered for conveyance and other relevant considerations;(6) to consider and determine other matters concerning the conditions on which traffic is handled and carried. 3. The establishment of a Central Conference representing the same groups of interests as those represented on the Local Conferences with an independent Chairman.
The chief object of the Central Conference should be to mediate in the event of any Local Conference not being able to agree Schedules of rates and charges and in any disputes arising between the parties to a Local Conference or between two or more Local Conferences.4. The agreed Schedules of rates and charges to be recorded in rate books for the use of the Local Conferences.5. The expenses of the Local Conferences and the Central Con-fereuce to be borne by the parties thereto in agreed proportions.6. Compliance with the decisions of the Local Conferences and the Central Conference- and with the agreed Schedules of rates and charges to be secured in such manner as may be determined when the Conferences are established.7. The Local Conferences to have the right to be heard before the Licensing Authority and Appeal Tribunal under Part I of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, on questions concerning the grant or varia-tion of, or the condition to be attached to, any &quot; A &quot; Licence or &quot; B &quot; Licence relating to the area of the Local Conference.Owing to lack of uniformity in the working conditions on the various canal systems and other considerations the members of this Association have been unable to arrive at a unanimous conclusion, four members having made the following comments:  On the one hand, the Grand Union Canal Company are definitely of the opinion that voluntary methods will not achieve the desired object, and the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company are opposed to any action being taken by the Ministry of Transport towards co-ordination.On the other hand, the Undertakers of the Aire and Calder Navigation, who have a special code of Conference Regulations with the Railway Companies, dated January, 1928, and referred to in Clause 11 of the above-mentioned Railway-Canal Agreement, find that these regulations work satisfactorily, and they particularly desire that nothing should be done to disturb their position under these regulations. In their opinion and in the opinion of the Company of Proprietors of the Calder and Hebble Navigation, which joins the Aire and Calder Navigation at Wakefield, no further steps are required towards co-ordination of transport in the areas served by their respective undertakings.I am instructed to add that the members of this Association are bearing in mind the recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Trans-port with reference to the desirability of securing further amalgamation of &quot;Inland Waterways and that any future scheme which may be found practicable will be brought before Parliament in ordinary course.APPENDIX 111.MEMORANDUM FROM THE GRAND UNION CANAL COMPANY. 2,0th September, 1936.I beg to refer to your letter of the 20th March, 1936, addressed to the Canal Association, and regret to inform you that my Company has been compelled to dissent from tire suggestions made by the Association in reply to that communication.My Board has as a consequence instructed me to convey to the Trans-port Advisory Council this Company&apos;s reasons for such dissent and also their suggestions for the attainment of the object outlined in your letter.In the first place, my Company cannot agree that the Railway-Canal Agreement has worked satisfactorily nor that it has achieved any prac-tical degree of co-ordination so far as our experience of its operation is concerned.
Having regard to the competing interests represented, my Company is further of the opinion that to achieve co-ordination between all forms of transport to the extent that would appear to be envisaged in your letter, some form of compulsion is essential to ensure the carriage of goods upon the principles enunciated therein, viz., &quot; By the means of transport which offers the greatest advantages present and potential of economy, efficiency, public convenience and national welfare &quot;.In these circumstances my Company ventures to make to your Council the following suggestions upon the subject and trusts that they may receive consideration, viz. :  The setting up of Local or Area Tribunals, also a Central Tribunal, the composition and duties of such Tribunals being shortly as under:  (i) Local Tribunals. The formation of Local Tribunals for agreed areas consisting of Representatives of Railways, Canals, Canal Carriers, Road Hauliers,  Coastwise Shipping,  with an  Independent Chairman.The functions of such Local Tribunals to be:  (a) To consider Traffics within its prescribed  area.(b) To fix rates for the carriage of goods with a differential in favour of water transport where available, having regard to the class and value of traffic, its nature and bulk in relation to weight, its route, the density of traffic thereon and public convenience.(c) To fix rates for storage or other accommodation provided at terminals or depots.(d) To arrange an organised division or allocation of services to be rendered by Road Transport in conjunction with other forms of transport.(e) To explore the possibility of interchanged traffic to secure the best use of each form of transport in its most economic sphere.(2) Central Tribunal. The formation of a Central Tribunal, the interests represented to be as in the case of Local Tribunals, with the addition of a representative of Traders, and with an Independent Chairman. The functions of such Central Tribunal to be:  (a) To implement the principles of co-ordination between all forms of transport and supervise the working of Local Tribunals. (6) To form the Local Tribunals and define their areas, (c) To arbitrate upon matters upon which Local Tribunals are unable to agree and to hear and decide appeals from Traders and others.(3) The decisions of the Central and Local Tribunals to be enforced under penalties upon any breach thereof.(4) The rates agreed to be scheduled and open to inspection.(5) The existing Railway and Canal Classifications to be replaced by a Classification of a more simple character applicable to all forms of Transport.(6) With a view to reducing long-distance road haulage, consideration should be given to the sub-division of road haulage &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; Licences, and in certain cases also &quot; C &quot;, into two sections, viz., short haulage up to a maximum of 25 miles, and long-distance haulage in excess thereof to an agreed maximum radius.With regard to Canals in particular, my Company offers with deference the following suggestions :  (a) That to enable Inland Waterways to contribute efficiently to the Transport system of the Country the main canal routes connecting the industrial centres and the ports should be brought up to, and maintained to, an agreed standard as to depth and sectional area, etc.(6) That the Railway-owned and controlled Canals should be brought within such a scheme.
(c) That further amalgamations of Canals should be undertaken and, failing this, the principle of through tolls should be extended to obtain uniformity of charging and handling of traffic.(d) That in the first place the main canal routes should be those referred to as &quot; The Cross &quot; in the Report on the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways of 1906.* It may be mentioned in passing that the whole of the Route No. 1 and a large proportion of Route No. 2, referred to therein, is at present vested in this Company by its recent amalgamations and acquisitions.I am directed by my Board to express the hope that the views of my Company may be of service in the deliberations of the Council on this subject, and to inform you that we shall be happy to amplify the views expressed or to supply any further information in our power.APPENDIX IV.MEMORANDUM FROM THE CHAMBER OF SHIPPING OF THE UNITED KINGDOM ON BEHALF OF COASTAL SHIPPING-12 October, 1936.1. The following memorandum is an attempt to put forward the views of British Coastal Shipping in response to the following invitation of the Chairman of the Transport Advisory Council &quot; 1. I am directed by the Chairman (Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen) to inform you that the Council has had under consideration the desirability of formulating practical principles upon which co-ordina-tion between all forms of transport carrying goods can be achieved and developed. As a result the Council has decided to undertake certain investigations, the nature of which is indicated below.2. The Council recognises fully the difficulty amounting almost to an impossibility of giving with precision a simple definition of the expression &apos; co-ordination &apos;. The Council considers, however, that for the purpose of the present investigations, &apos; co-ordination &apos; may be regarded as a state in which the various forms of transport irre-spective of ownership; can, under equitable --conditions, function efficiently (not only within their several spheres, but also as part of a comprehensive whole) under a system (either imposed or reached by mutual agreement) conditioned by public interest. In the opinion cf the Council this connotes the carriage of goods by the means of trans-port which offers the greatest advantages present and potential of economy, efficiency, public convenience and national well-being.3. The Council inclines to the view that it is not unreasonable to assume that principles on which co-ordination could be attained might be enunciated after an examination of the factors of &apos; service and rates &apos; as applying to each form of transport, but, however that may be, the Council is satisfied that no scheme of co-ordination can ignore the facilities offered and the rates charged.4. The Council has decided, therefore, to investigate the conditions concerning &apos; service and rates &apos; in connection with goods traffic carried by rail (including passenger trains), road, canals and coast-wise shipping.5. The Council desires me to make it clear that the expression &apos; service and rates &apos; is not here used, or intended to be used, in any narrow sense; on the contrary, the Council feels that it should be given the widest interpretation and should be understood to cover* Final Report of the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways, Cd. 4979 of 1909.   Published by H.M. Stationery Office, price 2s. nd.
all determining factors in an economic transport structure, including such matters as type of service afforded, control and publication of rates, wages and hours and conditions of labour.6. Accordingly, I am to invite the Chamber to prepare and submit to the Council (in writing and at as early a date as may be practicable) such constructive suggestions as the Chamber may feel able to make towards helping the Council to reach the end it has in view.7. I am to add that the Council has addressed similar requests to organisations  representing  railways,   canals  and  the   operators  of vehicles carrying goods by road.&quot; 2. Practically the whole of British Coastal Shipping is represented in the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom, and the following observa-tions are submitted by the representatives of that section of British Shipping.3. Experience has shown that the importance to the Nation of coast-wise shipping and the contribution which it provides to the internal trans-port of the country is not always fully appreciated. The attention of the Council is directed to the Statement laid by the Shipping Industry, through the Shipowners&apos; Parliamentary Committee, before the Royal Commission on Transport in 1929, which forms Annexe &quot; A &quot; to this document, * and contains an historical survey of coastwise sea-carrying power. Successive responsible Ministers and others have testified to the importance of coastwise shipping. Some Of these statements are contained in the attached note (Annexe &quot; B &quot;).f It will be seen that in November, 1929, Sir Julian Foley (then Mr. E. J. Foley) the head of the Mercantile Marine Department of tie Board of Trade, when giving evidence on behalf of the Board before the Transport Commission, saidl &quot; . . . . it must be borne in mind that the existence of an efficient and adequate coasting shipping service is of manifest importance especially in time of war or civil emergency. The carriage of coal and other bulk and general cargoes, and the distribution of food discharged at the larger ports from ocean-going ships to smaller U.K. ports, depend upon coastwise shipping. As almost every large centre of population in the U.K. is situated at or near the sea, the freest, most flexible and most economical distribution of the materials of industry and the means of maintaining life is impossible without full use of sea transport round the coasts.Coasting shipping must not, therefore, be allowed to be crippled by either railway or road competition, since in emergency the rail-ways and the roads cannot alone meet the needs of the situation.&quot; Carriage by water is, and must remain, the cheapest form of transport lor a large volume of internal traffic. Failure to take the fullest possible advantage of the economy of coastwise carriage for goods in large quantities must injure heavy industries and the export trade in particular and much other trade in general. The economic advantage of water-borne traffic has been recognised on the Continent, where coastal and river services have been supplemented at great expense by an elaborate system of inland water-ways communicating with the sea. Yet these advantages fall far below those which the United Kingdom possesses in a long and indented coast line with densely populated centres within easy reach of the ports. Much public money has been, and is being, spent on these ports. Their welfare depends on the coasting as well as the foreign trade. Any diminution of the coasting trade will re-act injuriously on the ports and decrease the volume of employment available for shore labour in the port areas.   In the* See page 37. t See page 41.J See Minutes of Evidence taken before the Royal Commission on Transport, vol. 3, p. 7S7, published by H.M. Stationery Office.
problem of the co-ordination of internal transport the part played by the ports must be kept well in mind. Shipowners attach importance to this aspect. The Chamber of Shipping has produced two reports on Port Facilities in the United Kingdom (one in 1924 and another in 1929); the first of these included recommendations for the improvement of facilities for coastwise shipping mainly at the larger ports, and the second was devoted to the smaller ports. The inter-dependence of ports and coastwise transport was stressed by the Royal Commission on Transport, whose report (para. 489) emphasised the dependence of coastwise shipping upon the ports with whose fortune, it stated, that of shipping was &quot; inextricably bound together.&quot; &apos;4. The total commercial traffic hauled by rail in Great Britain in 1935 was 271 million tons, viz., 175 million tons of coal, coke and patent fuel, 51 million tons of minerals and merchandise in Classes 1 to 6, and 45 million tons of merchandise in the higher classes. No precise figures of tonnage carried coastwise are available, but departures coastwise with cargoes in 1935 amounted to nearly 20J million net tons of shipping. It is estimated that this corresponds to the carriage coastwise of 22 million tons of coal and over n million tons of other cargo, or a total of over 33 million tons. The average railway haul is 56 miles. The average coastwise haul is over 250 miles, so that measured in ton miles the contribution of coastwise shipping to internal transport is about half as great as that of the Railway Companies combined. This ratio is much more comparable with the service provided by the railways than the mere juxtaposition of the figures of 33 million tons and 271 million tons would suggest, especially when it is remembered that the 271 million tons of rail-borne traffic includes much of the water-borne traffic twice over, once when carried from the point of consignment to the port of shipment and again when carried from the port of discharge to the inland destination, while in the 33 million tons of coastwise traffic each is counted once only. The extent of the coastwise carryings may be further illustrated if it is remembered that the net tonnage of departures with cargoes in the coasting trade represents the departures on approximately 100,000 voyages a year (98,360 in 1934).5. The provision of railway facilities for dealing with two-thirds of the ton miles of internal transport has involved the expenditure of over a thousand million pounds and the sacrifice of valuable agricultural land. Coastwise shipping is in a different position; it requires no artificial permanent way and its capital structure, both in toto and as regards individual units, is naturally on a much smaller scale. If coastwise shipping is allowed to decay the necessary extension of the railway system to carry the other one-third would mean the further expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds and the sacrifice of more agricultural land, and would be a menace to national security. A successful aerial attack on railway main lines or junctions could paralyse the system. The preservation of coastal shipping, which is both an alternative and additional form of internal transport, is essential in the interests of national security and prosperity alike, and is capable of indefinite expansion.6. Coastwise shipping may be divided under three heads-(a) Coasting liners. There is competition with both rail and road for most of the traffics carried by them, (b) Larger coasting tramps of over 1,000 tons gross.  These are mainly engaged in the coal trade. For coal cargoes there is no competition between them and road. On an economic basis there should be no effective rail competition, but such competition does, however, exist to a considerable extent in areas situated in the neighbourhood of ports, (c) Small coasting tramps of tender 1,000 tons gross. The ownership consists of a considerable number of small fleets and single ship units. There chief competition is with rail and to a lesser degree with road transport, although the severity of the latter is increasing.
The Coasting Trade has also to meet competition from foreign-owned vessels, of which, at the present time, the majority are small Dutch motor craft. Although the foreign share of the Coasting Trade, as a whole, is still little more than pre-war, the competition of the foreign vessels, the number of which has considerably increased in recent years, is now mainly directed against the smaller British coasting tramp ships, and is a factor which will need to be taken into account in considering the question of co-ordination.7. There is practically no competition between coastwise shipping and the canals. Canal services facilitate the inland collection and distribution of sea-borne cargoes.8. In examining the complex and difficult problem of co-ordination between the several branches of transport, the following considerations have a vital bearing on the competition between rail and road on the one hand and coastwise shipping on the other.(a) In the operation of coastal shipping every vessel is an economic unit. In the case of tramp vessels the freight charges for each voyage are fixed in direct relation to the operating charges pertaining to that vessel and that vessel alone. Each freight is based upon a precise estimate of the cost of performing the particular service for which it is paid. For coastal liner vessels the precise cost of carrying any particular consignment cannot, of course, be so closely ascertained, but the same principle of relating charge to cost applies. In railway economy there is little or no attempt at such correlation of cost and charge. Any attempt to base railway rates on the cost of service would meet with the difficulty of allocating to a particular consignment the overheads and permanent charges of a one thousand million pounds concern. The direct economic control of sea freights in relation to the cost of providing the particular services for which freight is paid is and must, therefore, be (a) in the case of a coasting tramp, immediately, and (6) in the case of a coasting liner, ultimately far more powerful and direct than any control of railway rates that Parliament has laid upon the railways or could devise.(b) Important elements in coastal transport are:  I. Ports costs, including:  Port, Harbour and / or Dock dues on both ship and cargo. Stevedoring and other handling charges for loading and dis-charging the goods. Warehouse charges on the goods. Wharfage charges on the goods. Pilotage on ship.II. Rail, road or barge charge for the short haul to and from the points of loading and discharge.III. Marine insurance on the goods.(c) None of the components of the cost of sea transport specified in the foregoing paragraph is normally within the control of the Shipowner. Quite the contrary; the rail charges and the dock and harbour charges, to the considerable extent that the docks and harbours are Railway owned, are under the control of the principal competitors, of coastwise shipping. The Railways are able to fix the level of short haul rail charges out of all relation to competitive direct rail charges. Moreover, while the non-railway owned dock authorities cater equally and impartially for &quot; coasting trade &quot; as for &quot; foreign trade,&quot; the Railways, while doing all in their power to provide facilities for their &quot; foregn trade,&quot; are not so disposed to provide coastal facilities or so to adjust their charges as to facilitate coastal transport.
K ft Oi.(d) The application of freight relief under the Local Government Act of 1929 to certain rail-borne traffics has led to the diversion of water-borne traffic to rail and has unfairly forced, and continues to force, coasting owners to make freight concessions for competitive traffics. The small derating relief at the docks is quite insufficient by comparison to offset the railway freight reductions and this is especially the case at railway ports where the minimum of derating relief is granted to coastwise ships.(e) Coal bunkers for coastwise vessels are excluded from railway freight relief.9. It is believed that with facts such as these in mind Parliament, during the consideration of the Railways Act of 1921 and the Road and Rail Traffic Act of 1933 (a) realised the need for safeguards for coastwise shipping, and (&amp;) provided for the inclusion of coastal transport in the forms of internal transport, the encouragement of which is one of the functions of the Advisory Council.10. The result of a recent application by the Great Western Railway Company for new exceptional rates on grain traffics between the Bristol Port Area and certain Cornish ports (see proceedings of the Railway Rates Tribunal for the current year, No. 38, 24th July), which was contested on behalf of coastwise shipping, does not encourage the Shipping Industry to believe that the operative provisions for the protection of coastwise shipping in the Railway Act of 1921, or the new protective Clause for coastal transport in the 1933 Act (Section 39), will be effective in prevent-ing the diversion of traffic from coastwise snipping to rail. A note of the facts in this case is attached as Annexe &quot; C.&quot;*11. Coastwise shipping has consistently welcomed or taken the initiative in promoting co-ordination. For something like three-quarters of a century various Local Conference arrangements have existed between certain of the Coastal Liner Companies and some Railway Companies and Canals. With the advent of the road motor vehicles an agreement was reached in May, 1929, between Coastal Liner Shipping and the four amalgamated Railway Companies to improve the machinery for the prevention of wasteful competition. The agreement provided for co-operation through a Standing Committee of the Directors and Managers of the Shipping Com-panies and the Railway Goods Managers and through Local Conferences in the several areas affected. The main aim of the parties is stated in the agreement as follows:  &quot; It is the desire of the Companies to increase co-operation between the various forms of transport and to facilitate the further develop-ment that is desirable if the growth of commerce and the best interests of the community are to be promoted.   It is their desire also to ensure that goods and livestock are carried by the routes which they should most naturally and economically take,  and thus promote the equitable distribution of charges as between Trader and Trader.&quot; 12. This system of co-operation has, on the whole, worked well and been of value and of advantage, both to coastwise shipping and the Rail-ways.   The agreement was revised in July, 1934, to meet the new situa-tion created by the power given to the Railways under the 1933 Act to make &quot; Agreed Charges &quot; which are not subject to the same extent as formerly, to considerations of undue preference, but the operation of &quot; Agreed Charges &quot; nearly 300 have already been made for traffic by goods trains and a considerable number for traffic by passenger trains  has raised matters of grave concern to Coasting Liner Owners, which will need wide vision on behalf of those operating the agreement to ensure* See page 42.
oits continued smooth working and usefulness. This agreement was taken as a model for a similar understanding negotiated in 1933 between the Railway Companies and the Canal Association.13. The problem of close co-operation between Coasting Tramp Owners and the Railway Companies presents greater difficulties. Whilst coasting liner tonnage is concentrated under comparatively few ownerships, there are approximately 200 owners of coasting tramp vessels. The definite sailings of the liner are to be contrasted with the work of the tramp carrying any kind of cargo between any two or more ports and up-river destinations. There is also the question of securing the inclusion of the owners of foreign tonnage in any understanding that may be reached. These are considerations which do not lend themselves easily to working agreements between Coasting Tramp Owners and the Railways. The possibility of co-operation between the two interests has, however, been explored. At the end of 1931 an understanding was arrived at between the Coasting Tramp Owners and the Railways for round table confer-ences to discuss matters of difficulty as they may arise, but the machinery has not so far been of much practical value. No request has been made by the Railways for a meeting under the arrangement, but at the instiga-tion of several coasting tramp owners a talk was held with the Railways in 1932 with reference to pig-iron traffic from the Midlands to certain Scottish iron works, which had been diverted to rail from coastal carriage by drastic cuts in the railway rates. Although it was urged that the value to the Railway Companies from the short rail hauls and dues on both ship and cargo at the docks under their control, when the traffic was water-borne, was comparable with the revenue from the direct rail haul, no progress was made.14. Shipowners feel that further advantage could be taken of this kind of friendly and voluntary co-operation between all four branches of internal transport. In particular they believe that if the Railways would recognise more fully the earning power of the railways through the encouragement of short rail hauls, combined with the development of the coastal facilities of their docks, much could be done in the national interest, as well as in the mutual interests of rail and sea transport. The removal of the handicaps under which coastwise shipping is suffering at the present time, and which are indicated in ^paragraph 8 of this memorandum, would facilitate a greater measure of co-operation between coastwise shipping and rail.15. Broadly speaking (a) port area to port area traffic which is suitable and capable of being forwarded by water should be carried by coastwise shipping as it is the most economical form of transport for this traffic; (6) the natural and best means, from the general public interest, for inland long distance haulage is railway, or in suitable cases canal transport, and (c) there are certain definite advantages in short distance inland transport being handled by road haulage, bearing in mind that the propor-tion of the collection and delivery cost on short haul traffic is high when it forms part of the service of another form of transport. The greater haulage by the railways of inland goods traffic (as distinct from port to port traffic) would tend to relieve the congestion on the roads and make a valuable contribution to safety of life.16. It may be that this broad object cannot be achieved without further control of long distance road haulage. The problem of co-ordination of internal transport arises largely owing to the tremendous development of road motors and the resulting existence of transport facilities in excess of the traffic available. Those concerned in coastal shipping are doubtful of the wisdom of allowing road transport to develop trunk services on an unlimited scale.   The first constructive step towards greater co-ordination
ANNEXE A TO APPENDIX IV (See page 32, para. 3).Extract from statement placed before the Royal Commission on Transport, November, 1929, by the Shipowners&apos; Parliamentary Committee.Coastwise Sea Carrying Power. The fact that most of our coal and iron areas are in coast districts created the demand for sea carrying power.   Indeed it was the transport facilities provided by coasting vessels, working in connection with craft ofof the several transport services is the examination of the question whether road transport should be limited to a certain haulage distance, except under licence in the case of special need.17. It has been suggested that coastal freights, Canal and road haulage charges should be controlled. In support of this suggestion it is argued that railway rates are subject to control. Prima facie this argument is attractive, but speaking with special reference to the control of coastal freights as compared with railway rates, it does not take account of the essential differences between the two services to which attention has been drawn above, viz. that the railways are gigantic units in which it has hitherto been found impossible to correlate a charge with capital and running costs, whereas coastal shipping is made up of small units and freight rates are closely correlated with both capital and running costs.Nor does it appear to take account of the fact that the control over railway rates from a competitive point of view has proved of very little effect.The only principle which seems to be applied in the control of railway rates is whether (1) the traffic could not be secured by a lower cut, and(2) in making such a cut to get the traffic, is the railway rate likely to cover expenses specially attributable to it and make some con-tribution to general running and capital charges.In practice it is impossible for any competing transport service or Authority effectively to check statements on these lines and the control of railway rates is not regarded by those responsible for the Shipping Industry, as effective. Again, the machinery for the control of short haul railway rates and railway dock charges in which coastal carriers are concerned has given no greater reason for confidence to coastal shipping.If progress is to be made in the closer co-ordination of rates as between rail and sea, it is believed that it must follow the lines of mutual con-sultation, mutual discussion and an attempt at mutual agreement on the lines of the Coasting Liner Shipping and Railway arrangement explained in paragraphs n and 12 of this Memorandum, followed, in the event of disagreement, by arbitration on the particular rates under discussion. It is difficult to conceive, however, how any such system of co-ordination of rates could be applied to Coasting Tramp vessels without grave risk of injury to those industries in the home and export trades, to which the cheap form of bulk transport provided by coasting tramp vessels is an essential need. Further, freedom in adjusting coasting rates to meet the competition from foreign vessels is necessary especially in the case of the small coasting tramps. Nevertheless, it is believed that discussions on other matters, including short haulages in port areas and port charges and facilities could take place with mutual advantage to the Railways and Coasting Tramp Owners.
light draught on the rivers, that formed the basis upon which our in-dustries were built up. Until the recent developments in motor trans-port, the roads never played any important part in the distribution of heavy traffic, and it is only since the application of the Macadam process of road-making, between 1790 and 1830, that they have been generally effective for light traffic.On the other hand, from the time when coal first came into use, it was carried by sea from the Tyne to the ports on our eastern and southern coasts, and from Swansea and Whitehaven to the ports on our western coast. From some of such ports it was widely distributed inland by river transport, and it was by the same methods of transport that all the heavy traffic of the districts so served was distributed. For example, from the beginning of the 18th century until the development of the railways:  Hull was the great traffic centre for the districts lying along the courses of the Ouse, the Aire and Calder, and the Trent. It handled for those districts their coal supplies, as well as the woollen, and iron and steel manufactures of Yorkshire, lead from the mines in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, cheese from Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Cheshire, and corn from all the counties adjacent to the rivers. It handled also every sort of heavy and bulky goods that were imported from overseas for use in those districts.King&apos;s Lynn was in the same way the great traffic centre of coal for, and the industrial and agricultural products of, the districts lying along the course of the Great and Little Ouse, and the other rivers running into the Wash. It was asserted in 1720 that by these navigable rivers the merchants of Lynn supplied six counties wholly, and three counties in part with their imports from overseas.London received all its coal supplies by sea, and was the great traffic centre coastwise of the agricultural products of the counties on the eastern and southern coasts, and of the provisions and other commodities brought from overseas. The Thames and its tributaries provided the only means for the transport of the heavy traffic of the districts through which they ran, up to Lechlade in Gloucestershire.Bristol was the great traffic centre for the districts along the Severn, Avon and Wye. Heavy goods were carried by water almost as far as Shrewsbury and Warwick, and it was claimed in 1720 that the whole of the trade of South Wales and the greater part of that of North Wales passed through its port.Liverpool served all the northern counties, Cheshire and Staffordshire, and a part of North Wales.All these big traffic centres were working with many smaller ports all round our coasts, which in their turn were using to the best advantage such navigable rivers as were available. Indeed, the history of the 18th century shows the vital significance of both the large and small ports in the national life. Speaking generally, all the manufacturing industries depended for their coal, and for much of their raw materials, on water transport; and both the industries and agriculture were largely dependent on the ports for the distribution of their products.As will be seen from the Table given below, up to 1835 shipping em-ployed in the coasting trade increased more rapidly than that employed in foreign trade, but after 1845 a diminishing proportion of the total volume of the traffic of the country was carried coastwise.Table showing the Entrances and Clearances of Shipping Tonnage in the ports of Great Britain in the Coasting and Foreign Trades, from 1825, and the weight of the Goods Traffic carried by the Railway Companies of Great Britain from 1870.

For years they worked to divert traffic from the sea, and the principal means they adopted to attain that end were:  (1) Reducing railway rates between points which could be served by both the railways and the sea.(2) Neglecting the facilities that could be provided by ports which had fallen directly or indirectly under their control.(3) Neglecting and not developing distribution by canals which had fallen under their control, and which are in direct communication with the sea.This cutting of rates not only diverted from the sea, traffic which could be carried by water to better economic advantage, but it also strangled the development of distribution by sea. It discouraged both the big and the small ports from making adequate provision for the coasting trade. Indeed it led to the practical abandonment of many of the small ports, and of river and canal systems working in connection with both the large and small ports, that had for generations played an important part in the distribution of the country&apos;s traffic.During the war, the process of uneconomic diversion of traffic from the sea to the railways was gravely accentuated. The railway rates were maintained, at the cost of the State, at a level entirely insufficient to cover the cost of transport, whilst coastwise shipping and the ports were left to bear enormous increases in their working expenses. The result was that both the railways and the big ports became blocked with traffic, and for a time the State had to step in and grant a subsidy in respect of goods carried coastwise.Minerals and MerchandiseEntrances and Clearances with Cargoes.

Since the war, some of the traffic diverted to the railways has been got back, but the entrances and clearances in the coasting trade in the last year for which the figures are available (1928) were only 35,800,000 tons net, as against 45,100,000 tons net in 1913.The importance of the question, and the need for action was realised by the Rates Advisory Committee. In their Report, made in December, 1920, after reviewing the extraordinary manner in which Railway Rates had been cut below those ruling on inland routes in order to meet water competition, that Committee stated :  &quot;It is of first rate importance that the exceptional railway rates which were brought into operation to meet competition by water should not be continued or form the basis of new rates, if carriage by coasting vessels and by canals is to be preserved, which in our opinion is essential. The shipping industry in the coasting trade is a very important one, and the preservation of alternative routes from port to port is of great moment to the trading community.&quot;But that Committee found it impossible to identify the cut rates owing to their enormous number, and they had to be content with recording the opinion that:  &quot; We are convinced of the importance of preventing the continuation of such an enormous number of rates as now encumber the rates books, and particularly of putting an. end to exceptional rates arising from water competition.&quot;The scheme formulated by the Rates Advisory Committee has not succeeded in putting an end to exceptional rates arising from water corn-petition. The fighting policy of cut rates against sea transport is still followed with vigour, although lately the railways have shown some willing-ness to work in co-operation with the coasters.The recent development of motor transport on the roads has been of great benefit to the nation, but it has involved the expenditure of great sums on the roads. So far little has been done to develop that form of transport around our coasts and along our water ways, although the expendi-ture on such development would in the main be confined to the provision of adequate modern facilities at the large and small ports for loading and discharging.In some of the smaller ports the Port Authorities, who are often the municipalities, have allowed the channels and berths to silt up for lack of dredging. And in few, if any, of the ports great or small have the quays and berths appropriated to the Coasting Trade, the road approaches thereto, and their equipment with mechanical appliances for the loading and discharging of the cargoes, been brought up to modern requirements.In most cases the cost of keeping up these ports would not have been heavy if it had been met year by year, but the Port Authorities knew that the traffic from which their revenue was derived was, in great measure, at the mercy of railway companies prepared to compete at what-ever cut rates were necessary to divert the traffic. They therefore had no income upon which they could rely either to meet current expenditure, or to offer as security for capital investment.The result was that when motor transport became effective we were as little able to take advantage of the sea as a highway for internal trans-port, as we were of the roads. On the roads the position was met promptly by an enormous expenditure out of public funds, but little or nothing has been done for the smaller ports although in comparison with the roads the cost would have been comparatively trifling.The point is often made that Central Europe and France have derived great benefit from the systems they have developed of carriage over their rivers and canal systems.   Those systems have been developed at
mvery great cost, but the facilities they afford fall far below the natural facilities which Great Britain enjoys as an island possessing an almost unlimited number of ports.If we are to turn to the best account the great natural advantages we possess in having at our command the sea as a highway between almost all our great producing and consuming centres, adequate port facilities must be provided. If that be done, there is the coastwise ship carrying power available, and able and ready to give good and efficient service, at a cost which will compare favourably with that of all other forms of transport.ANNEXE B TO APPENDIX IV (See page 32, para. 3). Note of Statements made as to Importance of Coasting Trade. On the 12th December, 1919, Mr. Arthur Neal, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport stated (Hansard, Vol. 122, col. 1848):  &quot; The coastwise trade is one of the essential forms of transport and one of the best means of relieving the congestion at ports and assisting the railways.&quot;On the 8th March, 1920, Colonel Leslie Wilson, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Shipping, stated (Vol. 126, No. 20, col. 917):  &quot; The desirability of increasing seaborne transport is fully appreciated by the Government, and in August last the Government Coastal Subsidy Scheme was introduced with a view to encouraging traders to make all possible use of coastal transit.&quot;On 1st July, 1920, Sir Eric Geddes, Minister of Transport, stated  (Hansard, Vol. 131, No. 89, col. S14):  &quot; At the same time there is nothing but sympathy with the coastal shipping industry, and it is the intention of the Government, so far as they can, to fix the railway rates at a fair competitive rate with the sea.&quot;On the 7th July, 1920, Sir Eric Geddes, Minister of Transport, in his term of reference addressed to the Rates Advisory Committee for their report on the Interim Revision of Railway Rates, etc., stated:  &quot; The Government attach great importance to the fair maintenance of Coastwise traffic, and the Committee are asked specially to advise, if having regard to the information obtained in the course of the Inquiry they are at present engaged upon they are able to do so, what in-creases should be made in the exceptional rates charged by the railway companies in consequence of water competition.&quot;On the 30th. July, 1920, in their Report (page 13) to the Minister of Transport on the Interim Revision of Rates, the Rates Advisory Committee, stated:  &quot; Upon the question whether when the Railway Rates have been increased by the general percentage here recommended the coastwise steamers will be able to attract a fair share of traffic at freights which will enable them to continue to compete, we have come to the con-clusion upon the evidence, with few exceptions, they will not be able to do so.&quot;&quot; We are, therefore, of opinion that it is desirable with a view to securing the continuance of the Coasting Trade that if rates can be shown to have been reduced to meet water competition they should be restored to a normal amount, but we regret that we do not see in what manner this can be done at the present moment.&quot;
On the 13th November, 1929, Mr. E. J. Foley, C.B., the Principal Assistant Secretary of the Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade, stated in giving evidence before the Royal Commission on Transport:- -&quot; 21. Apart from their regulative functions affecting coastwise ship-ping under the Merchant Shipping Acts and their controlling powers in connection with foreshore rights and tidal lands, the main work of the Board of Trade is in connection with ocean-going shipping and does not appear to fall within the terms of reference of the Royal Commission on Transport, though it must be borne in mind that the existence of an efficient and adequate coasting shipping service is of manifest importance especially in time of war or civil emergency.    .   .   .*&quot; The Board presume that the general case for the coasting shipping industry will be represented to the Commission by the Shipowners con-cerned, but it may be that from the nature of the case they would not so fully appreciate or stress its value in time of war and civil emergency, and the Board feel it necessary to emphasise the vital importance of the industry to the country in such times.&quot;ANNEXE C TO APPENDIX IV (See page 35, para. 10). Railway Exceptional Rates.1. An application by the Great Western Railway Company in April, 1936, for approval by the Railway Rates Tribunal of proposed Exceptional Rates for Grain (List E) Traffic between the Bristol Port Group and Truro, Penryn and Penzance, was opposed by the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom on behalf of coastwise shipping.2. The traffic represented in volume about 10,000 tons per annum and had been passing by water. The new Exceptional Rates were 57, 58 and 56 per cent, respectively below standard and the Notice of Objection urged that the granting of the new Exceptional Rates would (a) divert the traffic to rail and adversely affect members of the Chamber of Shipping whose vessels were employed in the coasting trade, (b) place coastal carriers at an undue and unfair disadvantage, and (c) by reason of their prejudicial effect upon the interests of coastwise shipping be undesirable in the national interest.3. The Railway Rates Tribunal held &quot; that the only question which is relevant to the consideration of such an application for consent to grant an exceptional rate is the question of the effect which the rate if granted would have upon the revenue of the Railway Company concerned; . . . it is not a relevant ground of objection that the granting of such a rate would have a prejudicial effect upon some competing carrier.&quot;4. Notice of Appeal to the Appeal Court has been lodged.October, 1936.APPENDIX V.MEMORANDUM FROM THE BRITISH ROAD FEDERATION.Introduction.The British Road Federation appreciates the opportunity afforded it by the Transport Advisory Council to put forward constructive suggestions with a view to the stabilisation of the Road Transport Industry in regard to service and rates for the carriage of goods, and submits herewith a memorandum of its suggestions in these matters.* The quotation continues as on page 32 above.
It should be made clear that in this matter the Federation undertook to act as the co-ordinating body through which the views of those carrying goods by road for hire or reward (that is the holders of &quot; A &quot; or &quot; B &quot; licences) could bring their suggestions before the Council in a single document.The following bodies have contributed through the Federation the views now submitted, namely:  Associated Road Operators, Commercial Motor Users&apos; Association,National Association of Furniture Warehousemen and Removers,National Road Transport Employers&apos; Federation,Scottish Commercial Motor Users&apos; Association, that is to say every existing national organisation representing &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; licence holders, and their affiliated Associations.As explained when the representatives of the British Road Federation met the Sub-committee of the Council on 2nd April last year, it has proved impossible in the views put forward to ignore the position of the &quot; C &quot; licence holder, but, in accordance with the request of the Sub-committee, such reference has been restricted to the bare limits necessary for the purpose of &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; licence holders&apos; proposals.It must be borne in mind, however, that the &quot; C &quot; licence holders operate about two-thirds of the goods vehicles on the road, and it is assumed that at some later stage opportunity will be afforded for the views of this important category of operators to be placed before the Council.In approaching the subject, the Federation has kept in mind the Council&apos;s request that its proposals should be so formulated as to be capable of inclusion, at a later date, in a comprehensive scheme directed towards the closer co-relation of the various forms of transport. The dangers of attempting to force the road haulage industry, without the full agreement of the industry, into a system of planned &quot; co-ordination &quot; cannot be too strongly emphasised.It would be useless to pretend that at this stage it is possible to put forward proposals which would necessarily remain satisfactory as the posi-tion changes. It is considered, for instance, that established operators should be able to expand their fleets without undue restriction and that if at some future date the road haulage industry should have been stabilised in regard to conditions and an agreed system of road rates introduced, the present restrictions imposed on new entrants to the industry might with advantage be considerably relaxed.In formulating its suggestions the Federation has endeavoured to avoid any attempt at the present stage to grapple with detail, and it is therefore hoped that, as and when each of the various stages suggested is approached, the Federation will from time to time be given further oppor-tunity of submitting its detailed views and suggestions on the matters involved.The Federation also wishes to place on record that the subject has been approached from the standpoint of normal peacetime conditions.Unfortunately, the necessity for preparedness for war will influence policy from time to time, but it is felt that such consideration will be outside the scope of the present suggestions, and, beyond emphasising here the importance of efficient alternative transport systems being avail-able in such contingency, this aspect has not been provided for in the suggestions now submitted.In conclusion, the Federation regrets that its suggestions have not been available for the Council at an earlier date.   In the ordinary course they
would have been submitted many months earlier, but, when the Bouts-Tillotson and similar cases came before the Traffic Courts, it was obvious to the Federation that such far-reaching matters of principle were involved that no useful conclusions could be reached until the points at issue were finally decided one way or the other.Signed on behalf of:  Associated Road Operators.E.

Survey of the Position of the Road Haulage Industry.(A) The Development of the Road Haulage Industry.1. Development of a Mechanised Road Haulage Industry. The mechanised road haulage industry is the direct descendant of the haulage contractors and carriers of the horse transport era. The development and cheapening of the internal combustion engine greatly increased the effective radius of activity of road vehicles, which had previously been Jimited in practice to the distance over which a horse could make the return journey in one day. A great impetus was given to motor road transport by the sale of Army lorries immediately after the War, and something of the possibilities of a mechanised road haulage industry first became apparent during the railway strike of September, 1919. Since that time the steady reduction in the price of new vehicles and improvement in their reliability, together with the fall in the cost of motor fuel, have contributed to a greatly increased use of motor transport on the roads. Other factors of importance have been the provision of better road surfaces, and the widening of the old roads and construction of new arterial roads and by-passes, together with the almost universal use of pneumatic tyres; as a result, the radius of road motor transport has been still further increased and the cost reduced. .   .2. Causes of Intense Competition in Road Haulage Industry. The most characteristic feature of the road haulage industry in its phase of rapid expansion, which covered the fifteen years after the War, was the ease with which newcomers could enter the industry.   The possibility of buying
cheap second-hand lorries, or of obtaining new vehicles on easy hire-purchase terms, together with the fact that no specialised training or skill was necessary to enable a man to set up in business as a haulier, made the industry an exceptionally easy one to enter for the man with little capital and no definite trade, other than a general &quot; handiness &quot; in dealing with machines, but who preferred to work on his own account rather than be employed by someone else. The mobility of the motor vehicle had a further consequence in minimising the possibility of any marked local variations in the position of supply and demand. In consequence the road haulage industry was, throughout its earlier phase, characterised by intense and often &quot; cut-throat &quot; competition between rival operators.3. Results of Intensity of Competition. The intensity of competition between hauliers meant that economies in operating costs were rapidly and automatically passed on to the consumer, but at the same time there were complaints that a section of the operators failed to keep their vehicles in a proper state of repair, and themselves worked, or allowed their drivers to work, excessively long hours at the wheel, while it was also stated that the wages paid were in many cases unsatisfactory. There was some substance in the charge that some vehicles were not properly maintained, the problem being usually that of the operator with only one or two vehicles, who could not afford, when busy, to have a vehicle out of commission for repairs. Excessive hours were fairly frequent, especially on long hauls where expenses were greatly increased if a driver spent a night away from his base although the largest operators, by working a shift system from depots in different parts of the country, were able to overcome this difficulty. Wages were a particularly variable item.4. Specialisation in the Road Haulage Industry. An increasing amount of specialisation has developed between the types of service provided by different operators in the haulage industry, although single firms may of course be interested in several of the different branches of the industry. It is impossible to draw a hard and fast distinction between local and long-distance hauliers. No doubt at each end of the scale examples could be taken between whom differentiation would be possible, but in between there is an infinite variety of types which merge into each other. Local hauliers include express parcels carriers and general hauliers, the latter normally obtaining a large proportion of their work in connection with building activities, and transport between docks or factories and ware-houses or markets, or just between factories. Local haulage work varies with the district, and it is not possible to set down any definite limiting figure of distance. Non-local work includes the providers of regular services between towns for general merchandise, the &quot; liners &quot; of road transport, and secondly the small free-lance operators, the &quot; tramps &quot;, who carry loads about the country as they can obtain them, and usually rely on clearing-houses to provide them with their business. In addition to these broad classifications, there are hauliers who engage in one particular type of transport only, often requiring special vehicles. Examples are furniture removers, and transporters of frozen meat, milk, petroleum products, live-stock, films and newspapers, many of whom are engaged in long-distance work. Such concerns are sometimes owned by the trader for whom they work and are sometimes independent. Even closer to the position of the ancillary user&apos;s own transport department are hauliers who undertake the whole of the road transport work of a firm on contract, usually painting their vehicles to appear as though they belonged to the firm in question. The road haulage industry thus covers the providers of a great variety of widely differing services, a fact which militates against any attempt to
generalise about its problems. Some sections of the industry, for instance, are highly competitive with the railways, while others do not compete at all.5. Public Road Haulage and the Ancillary User. An important factor in the development of the road haulage industry has been that the service provided, road motor transport, is of a kind which the purchaser of the service can easily supply himself, provided that the volume of the traffic in question justifies the full-time employment of a vehicle; as there are certain advantages to a trader in having his own vehicles, from the point of view of using them as advertising media, or because of the con-venience of keeping the transport process entirely in the hands of his own staff, it is usually necessary for a public haulier to quote rates to a trader showing some substantial saving as against his own costs. It is normally only possible for the haulier to do this if he can obtain greater use from his vehicles and so reduce the cost of his overheads per mile, or if he can obtain a better loading factor, or particularly if he can secure return loads. Briefly the haulier starts off with no special advantages as against the ancillary user, and can only obtain business by being able to organise his work in such a way as to make road haulage charges lower than the ancillary user&apos;s cost of doing the work himself.6. The Theory of Railway Rates. So long as the horse had provided the motive power for road haulage, the railways had, apart from a de-clining volume of traffic on inland waterways and a certain amount of coastwise traffic between ports, a virtual monopoly in the carriage of goods. Tempered always by the actual or potential existence of water competition, they were able to establish a system of charging according to an elaborate classification of different classes of goods, the object being to charge each class according to the &quot; value of the service rendered &quot;, or &quot; what the traffic will bear &quot;. The underlying theory was that the principal items of cost on a railway were in the nature of fixed charges, and that, provided any particular traffic covered the relatively low costs it involved, any contribution towards the fixed charges, no matter how small, was prefer-able to not carrying the traffic at all. Traffics of low value in relation to their weight and bulk could make only a small contribution towards fixed charges, or they would cease to be carried, while traffics of high value in relation to their weight and bulk could pay much more heavily. It was argued that, if the high-grade traffics paid less towards fixed charges, say pro rata to their weight, then it would be necessary to charge the low-grade traffics more; if this were done, the charges on the low-grade traffics would be more than &quot; the traffic could bear &quot;, and ex hypothesis such traffic would disappear. It would then be necessary, since no contribution what-ever towards fixed charges would be received from low-grade traffics, to increase the charges on high-grade traffics. It was therefore in the interest of all, that the classification system, and the principle of charging accord-ing to &quot; the value of the service rendered &quot;, should be maintained.7. Validity of the Theory of Railway Rates. This is not the place to discuss the validity of this theory. A full analysis would require investiga-tion as to whether the relative importance of fixed and direct charges in railway economics had remained much the same as they were when the theory was originally put forward; it would also be necessary to discover whether the high-grade traffics, which are nowadays usually carried in very small consignments, and which normally give a poor loading factor per wagon, and a small number of wagons per train, together with high handling and clerical charges, do in fact leave the railways a greater margin towards meeting fixed charges than the low-grade traffics, which are usually forth-coming at regular times and in regular quantities, giving a good loading factor per wagon, a large number of wagons per train and the minimum of handling.
8. Road Haulage Rates. Whatever the theoretical justification of the railways&apos; classification system may be, the practical effect on it of the de-velopment of motor road haulage has been far-reaching. Although, in its infancy, a section of the road haulage industry obtained competitive traffic by slightly under-cutting the railway rate, competition between road hauliers rapidly forced road rates down to a figure determined by haulage costs, i.e. hauliers were forced by competition to charge according to the &quot; cost of service &quot;; they were thus not so seriously concerned with the value of the traffics carried in relation to weight and bulk, as with the size and regularity of the consignments, the ease of loading and the likelihood of obtaining return loads to their base. Similarly, in deciding whether to hand work over to public transport, or do it himself, the ancillary user is largely influenced by the &quot; cost of service &quot; to himself of doing his own work. The result of the clash between the railway rates system of charging according to &quot; the value of the service rendered &quot;, or &quot; what the traffic will bear &quot;, which can only work satisfactorily under monopoly conditions, and the road system of charging according to the &quot; cost of service &quot;, was that all traffics which were thought to be able, under the railway system, to &quot; bear &quot; more than their cost of road transport, tended to be diverted to the roads; it was said that road transport was &quot; skimming the cream &quot; off the traffic. In their efforts to check this process, the railways have been compelled drastically to modify their system of charging by granting &quot; exceptional &quot; rates on such a scale that it has now become exceptional for the railway &quot; standard &quot; rates to be charged.9. The Problem of Different Systems of Road and Rail Rates. It has been claimed that the present economic organisation of the country and the geographical distribution of industries is largely dependent on railway rates, and that, unless the railways are protected, it will be necessary to offset a reduction in the rates on high-grade traffics in the direction of the road &quot; cost of service &quot; by an increase in the rates on low-grade traffics. This claim would not, however, appear to be entirely logical, since the low-grade traffics are already ex hypothesis paying as much as &quot; the traffic will bear,&quot; and, if the rates were increased, the traffic would presumably disappear, either through the firms providing it being forced out of busi-ness, e.g. rail-borne Midlands coal for London would be replaced by sea-borne coal, or through their finding alternative methods of water trans-port, e.g. the Midland coalowners would send their coal to London by canal instead of by rail. It would seem that the railway rates structure of the future will only be able to charge &quot; what the traffic will bear &quot; for traffics which are non-competitive with road or water.10. Limitations Imposed on the Haulier by the Ancillary User. The suggestion that a satisfactory solution could be found by making road haulage rates adopt a classification system based on the railway model cannot be entertained, since it fails to take account of the fact that the haulier is always competing for traffic with the ancillary user&apos;s own vehicles, in the sense that he must usually offer a cheaper service than the ancillary user can himself provide in order to obtain the traffic at all, and in no ordinary circumstances can he charge more than the ancillary user&apos;s own costs. If a classification system compelled hauliers to charge much more than the &quot; cost of service &quot; for high-grade traffics, such traffics would be lost to public transport altogether. Even with limitation of the number of hauliers, the same principles hold good, so long as the ancillary user is free to undertake his own transport; furthermore, even with official control of road haulage rates, it would be unworkable to have a classifica-tion system based on &quot; value of service &quot; without an elaborate pooling of receipts, since every haulier would wish to carry the high-grade traffics on which the rates were more than the &quot; cost of service,&quot; while none would be willing to accept the low-grade traffics on which the rates were less than the &quot; cost of service.&quot;
(B) Government Regulation of Road Haulage.ii. The Royal Commission on Transport, 1928-31. The impact of a system of transport, with its rates based on the &quot; cost of service,&quot; on a system in which an attempt is made to base rates on the &quot; value of ser-vice,&quot; was, in the 15 years between the birth of the road haulage industry in its modern form and the beginning of its detailed official con-trol, further complicated by the fact that, although rail rates were falling, road costs were falling much faster, with every technical improvement in the internal-combustion engined vehicle and its fuel, so that the field of competition was being steadily widened. The tendency for railway revenues to decline gave rise to an interested agitation for tightening the control of road transport, increasing the taxation it paid, and even for restricting its development. A Royal Commission on Transport was set up in 1928. Following their recommendations, the Road Traffic Act of 1930 was passed, which, while being mainly concerned with the regulation of road passenger transport, revised speed limits, made third-party insurance compulsory, introduced fresh regulations for the construction and use of motor vehicles, and limited maximum driving hours to 11 in any one day, while laying down minimum rest periods for the drivers. These provisions affected all motor vehicles, but so far as goods vehicles were concerned, no effective machinery for the enforcement of maximum driving hours was established.12. The Salter Conference, 1932. The next step affecting goods trans-port was the presentation of a memorandum to the Minister of Transport, at his request, by the four main-line railway companies. This was in January, 1932. In April of that year the Salter Conference was set up, consisting of four representatives of the railways and four members con-nected with road organisations. In July, 1932, the Conference reported in almost the identical terms of the railway memorandum in January, recom-mending severe increases in the taxation of goods vehicles, particularly the heavier classes. The regulation and licensing of goods vehicles, which had previously been recommended by the Royal Commission on Trans-port, was again propounded, the Salter Report moreover suggesting the extension of this to ancillary users, whom the Royal Commission would have exempted. Vehicles, according to the Salter Report, were to be licensed by the chairmen of the area traffic commissioners, who had been set up by the Road Traffic Act of 1930 for the licensing and control of public service vehicles. The licensing authorities were to have the right to withhold or restrict licences if they considered there was an &quot; excess of transport facilities&quot; in the district, or &quot; congestion of the roads &quot;; &quot; objections&quot; by competitors to the granting of licences might also be considered. Standardised records were to be kept, thereby making pos-sible the enforcement of maximum driving hours, and licences were also to depend on the proper maintenance of vehicles and the payment of fair wages. Furthermore, ancillary users were to be required to obtain licences, although not subject to the above conditions, except for those affecting fitness of vehicles, wages and hours. Finally, rather vague recommenda-tions were made as to &quot; division of function,&quot; to the effect that the Minister of Transport should prohibit certain types of traffic from going by road; the view of the Royal Commission was repeated that it was not in the national interest to encourage further diversion of heavy goods traffic from rail to road.13. The Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933. Increased taxation for &quot; heavy-weights &quot;, which was however not quite so steeply graded as the Salter Report had recommended, was introduced in January, 1934, while the recommendations for regulation and licensing were put into effect by the Road and Rail Traffic Act of 1933. Inspectors of the mechanical fitness of goods vehicles were established, and have worked without undue friction.
Licences were divided into three types, &quot; A &quot;, or whole-time haulage licences, &quot; B &quot;, or part-time haulage licences, and &quot; C &apos;&quot;, or ancillary users&apos; licences. At 30th April, 1936, excluding trailers, and taking into account only vehicles in possession, there were 26,736 &quot; A &quot; licence holders with 90,493 vehicles, 34,320 &quot; B &quot; licence holders with 52,809 vehicles, and 161,535 &quot; C &quot; licence holders with 316,714 vehicles. A National Joint Conciliation Board, representative of employers and em-ployed, was set up under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Transport in 1934, to give effect to the wages clause of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, with the object of agreeing wages for drivers of &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; licence vehicles. Detailed records of hours and journeys were required to be kept by all drivers of goods vehicles, and subsequently, by the Road Traffic Act of 1934, special licences were instituted for the drivers of &quot; heavy motor cars &quot;, i.e., vehicles of over 2J tons unladen weight.14. The Licensing System. In general practically all haulage vehicles in use at the time the licensing authorities took over their duties, were granted licences for an initial period, as laid down in the Road and Rail Traffic Act, of two years in the case of &quot; A &quot; licences, one year in the case of &quot; B &quot;, and three years in the case of &quot; C &quot;. Subject to proper observance of the law, &quot; C &quot; licences are granted automatically, as are &apos;&apos; contract &quot; &quot; A &quot; licences, i.e., licences for vehicles under contract to work solely for one firm. Other &quot;A&quot; licences and &quot; B &quot; licences may be the subject of &quot; objections &quot; by rival operators, or by the providers of alternative forms of transport, on the ground that &quot; suitable transport facilities in that district, or between those places, are, or, if the application were granted, would be, either generally or in respect of any particular type of vehicles, in excess of requirements &quot;. In practice, new entrants to the industry have been virtually excluded, while established operators, with the excep-tion of the railways which have greatly extended their road transport activities, can only increase their fleets with difficulty, and must usually produce evidence that, if licences for additional vehicles were refused, traders would be adversely affected. &quot; B &quot; licences may be and often are granted conditionally on their public haulage activities being restricted to a particular radius of operation or particular traffics, or both.v &quot; A &quot; licences may not be restricted in this way, but, before the granting or renewal of a licence, the licensing authority may require an operator to give particulars of the classes of work in which he proposes to engage, and, if he actually undertakes work of a different category, may take that fact into account at the end of two years in deciding whether or not to renew his licence. In granting or withholding renewals, the licensing authority must have regard to the conduct of the applicant and &quot; to the interests of the public generally, including those of persons requiring, as well as those of persons providing, facilities for transport &quot;. The licensing autho-rities have no power to fix or control road haulage rates, their influence on the trend of rates being only indirect, through their ultimate control of the supply of road haulage facilities.15. Road Haulage Wages. With regard to wages, the 1933 Act provided, as a condition of every &quot;A&quot; and &quot; B &quot; licence, the payment of fair wages and the observance of fair conditions of employment in relation to drivers of vehicles, and in 1934 a National Joint Conciliation Board was set up under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Transport to further the carrying out of wages regulation. Unfortunately the Board has experienced serious difficulties in its task, due in the main to the statutory powers under the Act proving insufficient to secure anything approaching universal observance of agreed standards of wages and con-ditions. Following representations to the Ministries concerned by the National Joint Conciliation Board, the Government in July, 1936, appointed a committee under the Chairmanship of Sir James Baillie to examine the
position in regard to wages and conditions of service of persons employed in connection with the carriage of goods by road (whether in vehicles coming under &quot; A &quot;, &quot; B &quot; or &quot; C &quot; licences), and to make recommendations as to the action it is desirable to take. A considerable volume of evidence has been presented before this Committee and doubtless its report will be available to the Transport Advisory Council at a fairly early date.* In view of this, it is not felt necessary to deal with this very important subject at any length here, except to emphasise that the general enforcement of an agreed scale or scales of wages is an essential preliminary to any degree of stabilisation, and would be of great benefit to reputable hauliers. Variations in wages are at the root of a large proportion of the haulage industry&apos;s rate-cutting troubles, since wages may account for as much as 40 per cent, of a haulier&apos;s total costs.16. Lack of Detailed Information about the Road Haulage Industry.  The full effects of the 1933 Act are only just beginning to make them-selves felt, and any possibility of advance from the position which has so far been reached in respect of regulation and licensing is made difficult by the great dearth of information&quot; concerning the haulage industry. Whereas a great deal of detailed information as to the activities of the omnibus industry is now to be found in the traffic commissioners&apos; annual reports, no such detailed information is yet available in the case of the haulier, the one annual report hitherto published by the licensing authorities being notably meagre and disappointing. The problem is more difficult in the case of the haulier than in that of the public service vehicle operator, on account of the greater number of the former and the smallness of the operating units, as well as the great variety of traffics carried and services rendered. Before the publication of the licensing authorities&apos; report, how-ever, official information about the scope of the road haulage industry was not so much scanty as practically non-existent.(C) Possible lines of approach to co-ordination and division of function.17. Desire for Further Co-ordination. There appears to be a widespread feeling that a closer degree of co-ordination between the different agents of transport than at present exists is necessary in the interests of the public, but that such an objective cannot be reached until each branch of transport has achieved a satisfactory measure of internal co-ordination. It must therefore be borne in mind that any scheme for the road haulage industry to &quot; put its own house in order &quot; must be framed with this end in view, so that it may ultimately fit in to a larger scheme for the co-ordination of transport as a whole. It may appear rather premature to plan further steps towards co-ordination before the full results of the Road and Rail Traffic Act have had time to become apparent, but some time must elapse before the next road transport legislation can be placed on the Statute Book, and an early indication of the trend of thought among road operators may be useful.18. Scope of Co-ordination. Co-ordination is a word which has enjoyed considerable popularity of recent years without having achieved any exact-ness of definition. In the case of the road haulage industry, however, it may be taken as affecting scope of services rendered (&quot; division of function &quot;) and rates, and it is under these two headnigs that the subject can most conveniently be approached. The road haulage industry suffers, however, under a severe handicap compared with the railways, in putting forward recommendations, owing to the lack of detailed official information as to road haulage activities. It is nevertheless possible to lay down cer-tain broad principles with regard to services, which would appear, to those engaged in the road haulage industry, to be matters of fundamental
importance, and to draw up a scheme by which road haulage rates could in time be effectively controlled, and perhaps ultimately brought into a working relationship with railway rates.19. &quot; Authoritarian &quot; approach to &quot; Division of Function.&quot; A some-what &quot; authoritarian &quot; approach to the problem of &quot; division of function &quot; has found a measure of support in some quarters, arising possibly from the suggestion in the Salter Report that the Minister of Transport should forbid the transportation of certain traffics by road. The theory would seem to be that the solution of the problem of co-ordination is to be sought in laws preventing heavy and long-distance traffic from going by road, and presumably, as a corollary, preventing short-distance light traffic from going by rail. As an alternative, similar results might theoretically be obtained under a unified control by the protagonists of road and rail respectively sitting round a table and deciding which traffics should go by road and which by rail.20. Freedom of the Trader. An &quot; authoritarian &quot; solution would, how-ever, be quite foreign to the spirit of British business. The trader, within limitations, is still free to decide how he will despatch his traffic, whether by road haulage, rail, water or air, or in his own vehicles. He makes his decision according to the relative cost and convenience of the different means of transport at his disposal: Thus the efficiency of all agents of public transport is promoted by the necessity, under which they all labour, of having to sell their services to the trader and not merely reap the fruits of a monopoly. If a trader uses a particular method of trans-port, it may be assumed that he finds it either cheaper or more convenient than the alternatives. Any limitation of choice imposed on the trader means that he runs the risk of losing something in cheapness or con-venience, through being compelled to make use of an agent of public transport, which, had he remained free to choose, he would not have employed. Transport should be the servant of the community, and any &quot; authoritarian &quot; restrictions of the kind envisaged will tend to increase costs of production and distribution. Put very briefly, if a trader prefers one form of transport to another, he usually has good reasons for his preference.21. &quot; Division   of   Function &quot;    through   the   Rates   Structure. Any &quot; division  of function &quot;  should,  in the opinion of the road haulage industry, result from the rates charged and the efficiency of the alternative services offered.   Should the rates charged be made to reflect at all accurately the differences in the cost of service of road and rail, an &quot;economic &quot; &quot; division of function &quot; left to the trader would result in each piece of transport work being performed by the agent of transport able to undertake it most cheaply and most efficiently, and would repre-sent the maximum economy in operation for the transport industry as a whole.   It has, however, frequently been stated that the railways do not know the cost of any particular piece of transport work, owing to the difficulty of making a fair allocation of &quot; fixed charges.&quot;    The same also applies to the difficulty of allocating charges over the different items making up a single train-load, so that even the direct costs may present a complex problem.   It is suggested, however, that the closer railway charges   can   be   made   to   approximate   to   railway   costs,   the   more economical, in the national sense, will be the &quot; division of function.&quot;   It may well be that the true railway costs for many of their &quot; competitive traffics &quot; are higher than their current charges, and it is possible that the profits  of  the  railway  companies   are   actually   made  in  the   heavy standardised traffics on main routes in which the roads are least competi-tive.   The difficulties of the railways concerning their costs are, however, a factor which would apply equally, whether a policy were adopted of an &quot; economic &quot;   or  an   &quot; authoritarian &quot;   &quot; division  of function.&quot;   If  an
&quot; economic&quot; &quot; division of function &quot; be accepted as desirable, the problem of co-ordination is at once relegated from one of &quot; limitation of function &quot; to one of &quot; rates and service.&quot;22. &quot; Obligation to Carry.&quot; Before leaving the question of services, it is necessary to make some reference to &quot; obligation to carry,&quot; since it is often pointed out that the railways are compelled by Statute to accept and carry at published rates any traffic given to them, while the road haulage industry is exempt from any such obligation. It must, however, also be remembered that the railways are free to use whatever quantity of rolling stock they like in connection with their traffic, while road hauliers are restricted as to the number of lorries they may operate. It would seem completely illogical, on the one hand, to tell a haulier he may only have five lorries, and on the other to tell him he must carry all traffic offered to him. So long as there is restriction of the number of lorries, there can be no acceptance of a general &quot; obligation to carry.&quot; It is possible, however, that a limited &quot; obligation to carry &quot; might be workable on the lines that a haulier normally undertaking a particular type of service must not refuse traffic, provided he has space in his vehicles available for that traffic, although the difficulties of enforcement would be very great. It is doubtful, however, whether any practical purpose would be served by the enforcement of a limited &quot; obligation to carry &quot; of this kind, since the implication of the proposal, viz. : that hauliers with space in their vehicles refuse consignments for places to which their vehicles are going, which would pay their usual rates, is in itself absurd. An &quot; obligation to carry,&quot; moreover, necessarily presupposes the fixing and enforcement of maximum rates (see Paragraph 57).II. Proposals for Immediate Action. Analysis of the three classes of proposal.23. In approaching the attainment of stability within the road haulage industry, there are a number of matters to which attention can well be directed at once, and in which it should be possible to achieve satis-factory progress within a reasonable time. These fall into three natural divisions:  (i) Those matters in which the provisions of existing legislation are ample and the only difficulty lies in attaining universal observance.(ii) Those matters in which the provisions of the 1933 Act actually hamper the approach to stability and demand immediate revision or modification.(iii) Matters which are not covered by the 1933 Act and which will entail new regulations.(A) Class I Observance of Existing Legislation.24. (i) Fair Wages and Working Conditions (see Paragraph 15).25. (ii) Better Observance of Driving Hours and Rest Periods with due regard to reasonable flexibility in special cases.26. (iii) Better Observance in Regard to Speeds and Safe Loading.(B) Class II. Changes in Existing Legislation.Under this category come:   27. Period of Licences. (i) The currency period of &quot; A &quot; licences is at present only two years, so that, under the ruling of the Appeal Tribunal, each &quot;A&quot; licence holder has to re-establish his right to continue his business
every two years. It is impossible to expect that, under such insecure con-ditions, operators can either maintain or build up organisations on efficient and economically sound lines, and it is equally out of the question for any industry so hampered to achieve a satisfactory degree of co-ordination with others enjoying a position of much greater permanency.28. Renewals and Variations of Licences. (ii) The existing procedure in regard to applications for &quot; renewals &quot; or variations of licences is costly, slow and involved. Further, the grounds of &quot; objections &quot; should be more closely defined and the objector required to state more fully his grounds of &quot; objections &quot; prior to the hearing of a case. Under the exist-ing system it is possible for a carrier with a soundly and efficiently con-ducted business to be denied the expansion which would normally result from his efficiency, and this is felt to be highly detrimental to the industry as a whole and as a public utility service to the community.29. Use of Information by Competitors. (iii) Information called for at public enquiries is frequently made use of by competitors to the detriment of the applicant.30. Rigidity of Licensing Provisions. (iv) The application of the licensing provisions in regard to such matters as the sale of business, mergers, expansion of trade, temporary decline of business and similar features is unduly rigid.31. Evidence from Traders. (v) The tendency to require individual traders to give evidence at public hearings is undesirable. The time involved and the fact that such traders are liable to be treated as hostile witnesses by those representing objectors, make them reluctant to attend. Further-more, traders naturally object to disclose details of their output, etc., at a public hearing. Traders, amongst whose customers may be included both hauliers and providers of other means of transport, also feel they are put in a false position by having to appear to advocate one type of transport in opposition to others, whereas in the majority of cases they employ, according to their needs and the suitability of the services, several or all types of transport.32. Unequal Status of Road Haidage Industry in &quot; Objections &quot;. (vi) While provision is made in the 1933 Act for &quot; objections &quot; to applications to be lodged, not only by other road hauliers but by railway, canal, or coastwise shipping interests, the Act makes no provision for any measure of control in respect of the facilities provided by such other types of trans-port. As an example, in a period of declining trade, it can be argued under the Act that any reduction of services to meet the reduced tonnage moving should apply entirely to road haulage, while, in the case of subsequent in-creasing trade, it might, and in actual fact has been argued before the licensing authority, that no expansion in road haulage could be warranted until and unless the other types of transport were occupied to capacity. So long as this state of affairs remains, it is clear that it is useless to attempt a reasonable working relationship between the different transport media.33. (vii) There is a tendency on the part of certain licensing authorities to force a &quot; B &quot; licence, which is subject to limitations, upon an applicant whose business consists of haulage for hire or reward. &quot; B &quot; licences should be confined to operators who combine trading with carrying for hire or reward. Moreover, with the continued decentralisation of industry, the work which has previously been done by horse transport for a particular firm may of necessity now have to be done by motor vehicles.
III. Proposals for later Action.(A) Principles affecting Road Haulage Rates.37. Proposals for Later Action Centre Round the Fixing of Rates. In addition to the points calling for immediate action, there are also proposals for later action, although it is recognised that these can only usefully be embarked upon after the points requiring immediate action have received proper attention, the road haulage industry has been given a breathing space to enable it to settle down under the new conditions, and the true economic costs and requirements of the industry have been ascertained. Proposals for such later action will centre round the fixing of rates. Once the road haulage industry has been stabilised, co-ordination should be approached by means of securing an &quot; economic &quot; &quot; division of function &quot; between the various agents of transport by means of the rates structure, while leaving the trader free to employ whichever agent of transport he considers most suitable; he will naturally, in making his choice, take into consideration the rates charged and the service given by the various providers of public transport facilities.38. Difficulty of Maintaining Road Haulage Rates. The road haulage in-dustry is in favour of the control of road haulage rates when the position is ripe for control, which cannot be until after the proposals for immediate action have borne fruit. Under-cutting has been a serious problem, accentuated in the past by the ease of entering the industry and the tendency for road haulage costs to decline. Even with the exclusion of new entrants, following the establishment of the licensing system and the re-striction of the vehicles of established operators, it has very rarely been possible to fix and maintain rates by voluntary agreement, particularly having regard to the importance to the operator of keeping vehicles fully employed through the two-year licence period and other provisions of the 1933 Act. Other important factors operating against voluntary agreements have been the great latitude given to the railways in quoting exceptional rates and &quot; agreed &quot; charges. It is believed that, under existing conditions, road rates cannot be made operative without some form of statutory control.39. Reasons for Fixing Road Haulage Rates. Before drawing up a scheme for the fixing and enforcement of road haulage rates, it is pertinent to enquire why road haulage rates should be fixed. It is still the excep-tion in business for prices to be fixed, otherwise than by voluntary agree-ment, or for any means of enforcing price maintenance to be employed, other than those at the disposal of a private trade association. Where prices are fixed, as in the case of railways or public utilities, it is usually a question of fixing maximum prices, with the object of protecting the consumer against a semi-monopoly, rather than minimum prices to protect the vendor. The fixing of minimum prices is in fact rather unusual and only done in exceptional circumstances. Minimum wages are fixed by trade boards for certain classes of labour, and there is Government control(C) Class III__New Legislation.34. (i) Fair Wages and Working Conditions (See Paragraph 15).35. (ti) Regulations to Secure the Additional Information Necessary in the Further Approach to Co-Ordination.   (See Paragraph 45).36. Drafting of Amendments to the Road and Rail Traffic Act. No attempt has been made at this stage to draft the various amendments necessary to meet these points, but such amendments can be later drafted and submitted if the Transport Advisory Council so desires.
of various agricultural products with the object of maintaining prices, but in these cases the theory is that the seller is in such a weak bargaining position that he requires special protection in the interests of equity and of general national policy. There is one other example of price-fixing which requires mention, and that is omnibus and motor-coach fares, which are fixed by the traffic commissioners, perhaps not so much for the purpose of protecting the travelling public against increases, as to protect the railways against the repercussions on their receipts of possible reductions.40. Protection of the Consumer by Statutory Maximum Rates. Prima facie it would seem that the exceptional position of the road haulage industry, in respect of the exclusion of new entrants and the restriction of the supply of road haulage facilities, would justify the consumer in asking for protection in the form of statutory maximum rates, but would scarcely justify the providers of the services in asking for statutory minimum rates. It might even be argued that, as the principal items of road haulage costs will, when the Act is enforced, be fairly constant for all operators, viz., wages, price of vehicles, tax, fuel and insurance, variations in rates must represent varying degrees of efficiency in the utilisation of the facilities available at a more or less fixed price to all operators.41. Protection of the Haulier by Minimum Rates. In addition to the road haulage industry, the fixing of minimum road haulage charges would probably be not unwelcome to the providers of alternative transport facilities, who would thereby have the limits of effective road competition clearly defined. The important aspect of the problem is, however, the point of view of the consuming public. As mentioned above, with the continued restriction of road haulage vehicles, the time may come when the public will require the protection of maximum rates, but, under existing conditions, it is still rather a case of the hauliers and the providers of alternative transport facilities requiring the protection of minimum rates to put a stop to under-cutting. Competition from newcomers to the haulage industry has already been largely removed, apart from the heavy influx of railway-owned vehicles, and it is recognised that, sooner or later, the time will come for co-ordination with other forms of trans-port; it has already been suggested that this co-ordination should be achieved by an &quot; economic &quot; &quot; division of function &quot; rather than an &quot; authoritarian &quot;; this in itself implies a definite system of road haulage rates.42. Road Haulage Rates and the Trader. It is appreciated that the level of road haulage rates is of intimate concern to the trader as well as to the haulier, and that, up to a point, their interests are divergent, in that the one would like to see the rates rather lower, and the other rather higher. In view, however, of the fact that the road haulage industry has been removed from the sphere of unrestricted competition, it is believed to be in the interests of the country that its organisation should be improved by eliminating the unsettling effects of the more flagrant types of rate-cutting, and that ultimately some modus vivendi must be found between road rates and rail charges. For these reasons it would appear to be in the interest of the public generally that rates should be controlled. It is appreciated that in such a control the traders must have equal representation with the hauliers. In fact the fixing of rates should be removed from the bargaining of the market place to a more stable plane, while, in the constitution of a rate-fixing authority, the representatives of the traders and hauliers should themselves be co-ordinated by the addition of a further element to hold a balance between the two and reflect the public&apos;s point of view.
(B) Necessary Steps in Instituting Road Haulage Rates System.43. Stabilisation of Existing Road Haulage Rates. It is essential that, if and when it comes to be undertaken, the change-over from the present system of leaving the fixing of rates mainly to bargaining between buyers and sellers, with a theoretical maximum of the cost to the buyer of doing his own work in his own vehicles, and a theoretical minimum of the direct costs incurred by the seller in carrying the load, to a system of rate-fixing by some statutory body, should be accomplished with the minimum of friction. It is believed that this can best be achieved by, in the first place, adopting a policy of stabilising the position at approximately the rates then charged by reputable operators, thereby eliminating flagrant under-cutting, but causing the least possible disorganisation to business. The general principles in fixing rates should be, firstly, that normally no rate ought to be fixed below the full cost of a journey, including a fair proportionate contribution towards over-heads, and secondly that no rate should be so high as to cause traffic to be lost to private transport.44. Protection of Haulage Industry from Rate-Cutting by other Providers of Public Transport Services. Some time must elapse before any system of road haulage rates could operate reasonably smoothly, and, during its teething troubles, it would not be difficult for the providers of alternative facilities to play havoc with the industry by a policy of cutting rates which the road hauliers were attempting to stabilise. It is essential, in any scheme of road haulage rates, that protection from outside competition should be given to the road rates structure for a definite period to enable it to be placed firmly on its feet. Experience of voluntary rates agreements, operating under the two-year licence system, has shown that rate-cutting from outside as well as inside the road haulage industry has made agreements break down, while the history of the omnibus and motor coach industry, since the passing of the Road Traffic Act, demon-strates the evils of a rigid system of road charges coupled with a flexible system of railway charges.45. Need for Additional Information on Rates. Anybody entrusted with the task of evolving a road rates structure will be handicapped, as already indicated, by the general absence of information regarding the work done by the road haulage industry and the rates charged. Before any scheme can be introduced, it will be necessary to collect a great deal of informa-tion, and it is suggested that the first step towards fixing rates should be the collection of information on the general lines of the N.R.A. code in America. A standard consignment-note might be made compulsory in respect of specified types of traffic, setting out the description, weight, origin and destination of the load and the charge made.(C) Possible Machinery for fixing Road Haulage Rates.46. A Road Rates Tribunal. Once the preliminary process of collecting information had been completed, the question would arise of the type of control desirable for road haulage rates. Consideration might be given to the establishment of a Road Rates Tribunal.47. Function of Road Rates Tribunal. The function of such a Road Rates Tribunal would be to take responsibility for fixing and for altering road rates, and to act as a final court of appeal to decide on any applica-tions submitted by associations of hauliers, or by traders or representative bodies of traders, for the increase or decrease of rates. It is probable that, once a basic structure of rates had been agreed, the work of a Road Rates Tribunal of the type envisaged would consist mainly of granting or withholding applications for changes in these rates, and that, in making their decisions, they would be required to strike a balance between the interests of the hauliers and of the traders.   It would also be part of the
-duty of the Tribunal to see that reductions or increases in transport costs were passed on to the public.48. Area Rates Commissioners. In view of the magnitude of the problem, it would certainly be necessary for the Road Rates Tribunal to decentralise a great deal of its work to paid officials in the country, who might be called Area Rates Commissioners, possibly appointed on the basis of one to every traffic area.49. Area Rates Advisory Committees. It would clearly be necessary for the Road Rates Tribunal and the Area Rates Commissioners to work in the closest co-operation with the representatives of the road haulage in-dustry, who might be organised by traffic areas in Area Rates Advisory Committees. The initiative in submitting proposed rates schedules might come either from Area Rates Advisory Committees or Sub-committees, or from the Area Rates Commissioner, who would have the duty of prepar-ing schedules of rates and discussing them with the Area Rates Advisory Committee and with traders, before submission to the head office of the Road Rates Tribunal for approval or alteration.50. National Rates Advisory Committee. Many of the long-distance rates affect more than one traffic area, and it would be necessary to have .a National Rates Advisory Committee appointed by associations of road hauliers to deal with matters which could not be settled by the Area Rates Advisory Committees, to lay down broad principles of national policy and in general to guide the Area Rates Advisory Committees, and also, of course, to maintain head office contact with the Road Rates Tribunal.51. Co-operation between Hauliers and Road Rates Tribunal. It is clear that the success of a scheme of this kind would depend on the willingness of advisory committees of hauliers to co-operate with the Area Rates Commissioners and the Road Rates Tribunal. It is appreciated that this would throw a great deal of work on to those who were willing to undertake it, and that, unless the advisory committees were fairly representative of the whole industry, much of their value would be lost. It would probably be necessary for the organisations representating road hauliers to depute a number of paid officials to specialise in the subject of rates and co-operate with the officials of the Road Rates Tribunal and the Area Rates Commissioners.(D) Possible Machinery for enforcing Road Haulage Rates.52. Enforcement by the Licensing Authorities. Next to the problem of devising machinery for fixing rates would come the problem of enforcing the rates that had been fixed. Voluntary rate agreements in the past have usually broken down, owing to the fact that the committees fixing rates have not had any means of bringing effective pressure to bear on rate-cutters. The only ultimately effective way of enforcing the proper observance of rates laid down would be to make their observance one of the conditions of holding a licence. This would make necessary a close liaison between the Area Rates Commissioner and the licensing authority, since only the licensing authority has the power to grant or withhold a licence. The proper machinery for enforcement would be some method by which the Area Rates Advisory Committees could report rate-cutters to the licensing authority, who would be in a position, subject to a right of appeal, to inflict a suitable punishment. This would mean a revision of the legal status of the licensing authorities, who, under the Road and Rail Traffic Act, have no power to take the rates charged into considera-tion, in deciding whether or not to renew a licence, and have no influence over rates, other than, ultimately, the control of the supply of road haulage facilities.
53- Enforcement by the Trade Associations. The only alternative to leaving the punishment of the rate-cutter in the hands of the licensing authorities would be to hand it over to representatives of the haulage associations, but it is felt that this would be less satisfactory, since the punishment they could inflict would be the forfeiture of funds deposited with the association. Many small hauliers are not in a financial position to make substantial deposits, while others might be willing to forfeit their deposits from time to time for the sake of obtaining new business. Other trade associations usually derive their power from the fact that they can, if necessary, withhold supplies from the trader of the commodity which the trader sells. In the case of the road haulage industry, the haulier sells the service of transport. Only the licensing authority has the power to withhold his supplies by suspending, withdrawing or refusing to renew his licences. To give the same power to the trade association would involve making the haulier answerable to two masters, which is neither reasonable nor practicable.(E) Principles in determining Road Haulage Rates.54. Basis for Fixing Rates. Assuming that suitable machinery could be set up for fixing rates, and, once fixed, for enforcing them, the even more fundamental question remains of what sort of rates should be fixed. The trader wants maximum rates as a protection against exploitation by an industry in which competition has been limited. The haulier wants minimum rates as a protection against the under-cutting which is still widespread. In any case a fairly wide flexibility in rates is advisable, since the service of road transport is not absolutely standardised and may include various little special services which would justify one rate being higher than another. Furthermore, flexibility is desirable to enable the road haulage industry, if necessary, to meet rate-cutting campaigns on the part of the providers of alternative transport facilities. An effective control of road haulage rates is required rather than their fixing or stabilisation at any given level.55. Costs as a Basis for Rates. Opinion has been expressed from time to time in favour of fixing minimum rates according to schedules of costs, but there are certain drawbacks to this system, although schedules of costs may furnish a useful guide towards giving a decision on points in dispute. The labour of calculating costs for all possible journeys and all types of vehicle would of course be enormous, and, once collected, they would not be a static factor; although many items are, as already indicated, more or less stabilised for all operators, or soon to be stabilised with the enforce-ment of wage-scales, the actual costs per ton-mile of different operators engaged on the same class of work vary enormously according to the area of operation, the suitability of the vehicles used, the load factor obtained, and the mileage per annum. The problem would be greatly simplified if, instead of attempting to calculate costs in every case, the actual rates charged by reputable operators were taken in the first place as the most reliable guide, and the representatives of the road haulage industry asked to co-operate in establishing what these were. Rates naturally vary appreciably according to the different classes of goods, their bulk in rela-tion to their weight, and the time taken in loading and unloading, the quantities carried at a time and the regularity with which loads are forth-coming; this suggests the possibility of establishing some simple classifica-tion system according to commodities, with variations according to the size of the load, while firms which were prepared to hand over large volumes of traffic in the course of a year would naturally expect preferen-tial treatment. Certain types of haulage work, such as furniture removing, and the carriage of heavy machinery, where the services given go far beyond mere haulage, would of course have to be excluded from the general scheme and treated separately.
56. Return Loads. In addition to the considerations already referred to, which all have a bearing both on costs and charges, perhaps the most important remaining factor is the likelihood or otherwise of obtaining a return load on particular routes. This naturally has a very direct in-fiuence on charges. It is desirable to prevent the type of rate-cutting which arises when hauliers, who have obtained a profitable load on the outward journey, take return loads at anything in excess of the difference in costs between returning empty and full (including the loading and unloading). The factor of the varying likelihood of return loads on different routes rules out of court any scheme based on standard ton-mileage rates for the whole country.57. The Risk of Rates becoming Inoperative through the Inadequacy of Facilities. A difficulty which might possibly arise is that, in the absence of any obligation to carry, a local group of hauliers, who were dissatisfied with a particular rate, might decide to boycott traffic for which that rate operated, so that the trader, although in theory only paying a given rate, might in practice find no transport facilities available at that rate. Should this happen, it would be necessary to give traders the right to appeal to the licensing authority and point out that facilities were deliberately withheld at the &quot; standard &quot; rate. If, after a public bearing, the licensing authority were satisfied that the complaint was justified, he should be required to issue licences for additional vehicles to persons who were prepared to operate them on the service and in the district in question, and should take into account the behaviour of the operators who had participated in a boycott in deciding whether to suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew their licences. The limitation of vehicles and enforcement of reasonable rates would make the possession of a licence an asset of considerable value, which operators would hesitate to risk by foolish behaviour. It would of course be necessary to dis-distinguish between a deliberate boycott and a lack of vehicles at the &quot; standard &quot; rates for particular seasonal tasks, such as sugar beet cartage, which should be met by the granting of sufficient short-term licences to enable both the seasonal work to be undertaken and the regular activities to continue without interruption. -(F) Ultimate Co-ordination of all forms of Transport.58. Free Co-ordination to Allow for Changes in &quot; Division of Function.&quot;  It is appreciated that the determination and enforcement of a road rates structure would require considerable time, but it is felt that there is perhaps a tendency to over-emphasise the urgency of some of the problems demanding solution, and that far better ultimate results would be achieved through the more or less free co-ordination of all forms of transport through rates structures, than can be achieved by arbitrary restrictions. The relative efficiency and usefulness to the community of the various forms of transport has altered in the past and will no doubt continue to alter in the future; any scheme of co-ordination should be sufficiently flexible to allow changes in the &quot; division of function &quot; to be made, as the relative efficiency of the different forms of transport alters or as new forms arise. In theory it might be possible to achieve this by a cen-tralised control embracing all agents of public transport, which would have no axe to grind in preferring one form rather than another, but in practice there would be insufficient incentive to increase efficiency, and the unwieldiness of such a huge organisation would make changes difficult, while there might be an unwillingness to provide for a sufficient rate of obsolescence in the different instruments of transport.59. Independence of Each Agent of Transport tinder a Supreme Tribunal. The best results are likely to come from an ultimate co-ordina-tion based on each agent of transport being able to speak as a co-ordinated
unit, and having every incentive to improve its efficiency and increase its traffic, with some form of Supreme Tribunal to co-ordinate rates and adjudicate upon disputes. Such a system would leave a useful element of competition and take full account of the realities of technical change, while avoiding the difficulties besetting complete amalgamation. It must, however, be emphasised that a solution on these lines can only be treated as a goal for the distant future. The steps for immediate action outlined in Part II of this memorandum must be undertaken before any final comprehensive scheme of co-ordination can be introduced, and the omission of any one of these steps might well prove disastrous, not only to the road transport industry, but to the whole future of co-ordination. The introduction of any comprehensive scheme of co-ordination without the full agreement of the industry and proper consultation with the trading interests affected cannot be too strongly deprecated.(45226 40)   Wt. 2434-236   5000   10/37   P.
