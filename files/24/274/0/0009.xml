Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1938.SECRET. CP. 9 (38).CABINET.PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY DEER.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.SINCE the War there has been, in Scotland, a spread of deer out of their accustomed haunts, with the result that considerable damage has been done to agricultural land and woodlands. The problem is a difficult one and has been the subject of repeated investigations and exhaustive consideration.2. Between 1919 and 1921 it was enquired into by two committees, the Departmental Committee on Deer Forests and the Departmental Committee on Game and Heather Burning. The former recommended, with a view to increasing the pastoral uses of the land then given up to deer, that deer forests should be divided into four classes by local committees with independent chairmen who would determine also the stock which each forest should carry. The Committee recommended also that the extension of deer forests should be forbidden by statute except with special sanction given after enquiry by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Game and Heather Burning Committee, which was concerned rather with the prevention of damage by deer than with the problem of increasing the productivity of deer forests, recommended that, as soon as economic conditions permitted, owners of deer forests should be required to fence them efficiently where they adjoined cultivated or grazing land; that in the meantime occupiers of cultivated land not sufficiently fenced against deer should be authorised to kill deer injuring their crops or enclosed meadows; and that the Board of Agriculture for Scotland should be empowered, where they were satisfied that damage was being done by deer to grazing land, to call upon the proprietor of the land from which the deer came to take steps to prevent or abate the nuisance, and in the event of his failing to do so, to authorise the occupier to shoot dear on the land on which damage was being done.3. No legislation followed on the reports of these two Committees as the practical difficulties involved were found to be insuperable. The problem, however, continued to receive attention and in 1928 a conference was held with repre-sentatives of the Agricultural Associations in Scotland and the Scottish Land and Property Federation. The Federation offered to take special steps to secure the co-operation of owners of deer forests in the killing of hinds during the winter. The results of the Federation^ efforts were, however, found to &quot;be disappointing and inadequate, and, after further discussion, an Advisory Committee, appointed by the Farmers&apos; and Landlords&apos; Associations, was set up under the Chairmanship of Lord Lovat with a view to framing a non-controversial measure.4. In 1932 a new Committee was appointed, again under the Chairmanship of Lord Lovat, and after holding frequent meetings agreed, on the heads of a draft Bill.   The main provisions of this Bill were (1) that Committees should be appointed by the Secretary of State for regionswhere he considered they were necessaiy; (2) that these Committees should recommend the classification of deei&apos; landsin these regions into two categories, viz., Class I (lands wholly or mainly used for deer) and Class II (lands contiguous to Class I landsand used partly for deer);[16537]Copy No.    4 1
(3) that the Committees should be empowered to organise the killing of deer on classified or unclassified lands, the costs to be borne, so far as possible, by the owners of the lands; and(4) that occupiers of holdings should be entitled to kill deer on enclosed land.5. Proposals on the lines of those recommended by Lord Lovat&apos;s Committee were submitted to the Cabinet by my predecessor on the 12th March, 1936 (CP. 75 (36)), and were approved by the Cabinet on the 18th March, 1936 (Cabinet 21 (36), Conclusion I).6. When a Bill for giving effect to them came to be drafted, however, it was realised that the proposals involved considerable difficulties both of a practical and political nature. It was therefore felt to be inadvisable to proceed further with a Bill on the lines approved by the Cabinet.7. The problem of preventing damage by deer has, however, continued unabated in spite of efforts to mitigate it by means of voluntary action on the part of landowners. I have therefore felt it essential to give further considera-tion to the introduction of legislation and I believe that proposals have now been framed which will prove effective and, at the same time, avoid many of the difficulties which emerged in connection with the former Bill.8. I propose in the first place that the occupiers of agricultural holdings, or of enclosed woodlands should be empowered, under suitable safeguards, to kill or destroy deer found on their land. This will not in itself, however, be sufficient, as the root of the problem is to be found in the excessive stocks of deer in certain of the forests. Such deer, failing enclosure (which is economically impracticable), inevitably spread to the pastures and cultivated grounds adjacent. Experience has shown that the proprietors cannot, in all cases, be relied upon to take the necessary action to reduce these excessive stocks and some means must therefore be found of compulsorily reducing the number of deer where necessaiy in the interests of agriculture. I propose, therefore, to take power, if I am satisfied on representations by Associations or bodies of persons interested in agriculture or sylviculture that damage is being done by deer to agricultural or forest interests, and that prevention of the damage cannot be secured by the exercise rtf the tenant&apos;s right to shoot deer found on his agricultural land or woodlands, to set up a Deer Regulation Committee for the area affected. This Committee would, in the first place, endeavour by negotiation with the owner to secure that steps for reducing the number of deer on his lands were taken, but, if they failed, they would be empowered themselves to authorise, again under suitable safeguards, the shooting of the necessary number of deer.9. I believe that proposals on these lines would go a long way to remove the admitted grievance which at present exists and that they would command a wide measure of acceptance. In particular, they avoid the difficulties which would have resulted from the adoption of the previous proposal to schedule deer forests in two categories.  The Treasury have been consulted and have no objection to them.10. I accordingly ask the authority of my colleagues for the preparation of the necessary Bill and for its submission to the Committee of Home Affairs.W. E. E.Scottish Office, January 21, 1938.
