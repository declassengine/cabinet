CO NF IDE NT IAL. A..C. .396 .BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OF TRADE - DECEMBER,  1937.Summary of reports submitted &quot;by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS.TRADE.      Imports in December at  94.3 m.  were  10.8 m. more than in December, 1936.      Nearly o0% of the rise was in food and    raw materials.      Of the increase of  4.1 m.  in manufactured goods,  1.9 m.  related to iron and steel manufactures,  907,000 to non-ferrous metals and manufactures and  598,000 to oils, fats and resins.    Exports of United Kingdom products,  43.9 rti. , were  3.4 ;m  more than in December, 1956,  and re-exports,  nearly  5.0 m., were  1.2 m. less.EMPLOYMENT.    The estimated number of insured persons aged 16 - 64 in employment (excluding agricultural workers) at 13th December was 11,437,000, which is 135,000 less than in November but on a comparable basis 200,000 more than in December, 1936.      The decline in employment &quot;between November and December was most marked in outdoor occupations,  e.g. building, public works contracting, stone quarrying, ship-building and ship-repairing.    Other industries affected Included textiles, boots and shoes, pottery, furniture, food.manufacture, metal goods,  electrical apparatus and shipping.    Employment improved in the distributive trades, hotel, etc.  service, and to a slight extent in motor vehicles.The total number of unemployed persons on the registers at 13th December - 1,665,407 - was 166,204 more thon at 15th November.-1-
The changes in the various divisions were:-London....... +    6,956 North Western.... 4- 27,084South Eastern * 10,824 Northern ....... + 16,253South Western +    7,144 Scotland ....... + 37,350Midlands...... + 25,737 Wales........... 4- 5,084North Eastern * 31,682RAILWAY TRAFFIC.    In the four weeks enaed 26th December railway traffic receipts increased by  823,000 (6.76$) as compared with the corresponding period of 1936.    The value of passenger traffic increased by 5.92$, merchandise, minerals and livestock oy 6.62$ and coal,  coke and patent fuel by 12.43$.      These increases were partly aue to increased charges which became operative, on 1st October.    Total receipts for the fifty-one weeks ended 26th December increased by  7.19 in. (4.66$) compared with the corresponding period of 1956.SHIPBUILDING.    The  amount of merchant tonnage under construction in Great Britain and Ireland at 31st December was 1,125,000 tons gross as  compared with 1,185,000 at 30th September and 964,000 a year ago.    Shipyards continue busy on Admiralty work;    out shipowners still show hesitation in placing orders for mercantile tonnage owing to increased production costs and the fall in freights.SHIPPING. The fall in freight rates continued.    The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 = 100) was 126.24 as compared with 145.04 in November and 135.51 in December, 1936.    At 1st January 175,000 net tons of shipping were laid up in Great Britain and Ireland as compared with 99,000 at 1st October and ^12,000 at 1st January, 1937.s. d.BANKING. The Treasury Bill rate fell by stages from 18/2.16 s. to  10/11.59 &apos; owing to buying by the banks.    The note circulation reached a record figure ( 509m) but money was kept in ample supply by purchases of government securities by the Bank of England.    The price of gold weakened from 140/0-g-d. to&quot;139/6d. and the premium over the dollar parity declined.    The silver market was extremely unsettled owing to the coming termination of the London Silver Agreement and
uncertainty as regards United States buying policy.    The franc was very steady around 147 during most of the month but later weakened owing to political uncertainty,  the discount on the three months forward rate rising to 4-g.      The dollar fluctuated between 4.98^- - 5.00f. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.Belgium.  The belga remained firm.    The discount on 3 months forward is now only 4 cents., but the spot exchange is higher.France.  Conditions on the Bourse remained quiet.    Closing quotations were low owing to the Paris strikes, and rentes declined.    French control kept the depreciation of the franc within narrow limits,  out the 3 months forward rate widened.Germany. The agreement covering foreign short term credits granted to German institutions &quot;before the 1931 crisis was extended until February 1939.      Reiehsmarks fluctuated slightly during December.    Registered marks improved over Christmas, but steadied later at 46$ discount.Holland. The money market remained liquid.&apos;  Share prices were satisfactory,  and improved slightly at the close.    Florins continued in demand, and on 3 months forward florins an average premium of lg- cents, was quoted.Italy. The lira averaged 94.99 during December.    The clearing accounts showed a heavy balance in favour of Great Britain at the 31st December.Japan. The money market remained quiet and funds were plentiful.    Government Bonds were steady.    The stock market was less active at the close, owing to anxiety over the foreign situation.Poland.  The Bank rate was reduced from b% to 4?%.Switzerland. The market was liquid and   lending abroad showed signs of revival.    The&apos; Swiss franc was slightly cheaper.
U.S.A. Industrial production was further curtailed, and there was., a continued efflux of gold to Europe.    New financing ;vas at an extremely low level.    Stock markets were weaker.    The dollar &quot;was comparatively steady &quot;but the premium on forward dollars widened slightly.COAL. The general position was satisfactory.    In the inland trade,  there was an exceptionally heavy industrial demand and the usual seasonal expansion in domestic demand. The decline in export trade was arrested towards the end of the month.    Output for the four weeks ended 18th December (20.61 m.tons) was 988,000. tons more than in the corresponding period in 1936.    Exports in December amounted to 3.09 m. tons as compared with 2.97 m.  tons a year before.    The main  . increases were to Italy and Germany.    Markets taking less included France,  the Netherlands and Argentina.IRON AND STEEL.    Pig iron production in December at 785,800 tons -was 112,000 tons more than in December, 1956.    Production in 1937 (8,497,000 tons) was the highest  since the war and furnaces will be fully occupied for several months to come. Crude steel output, at 1,103,800 tons, was 85,000 tons more than a year before.    Output for 1937 (12,964,000 tons) was an all-time record,  and the supply position is easier owing to increased home production and foreign deliveries;    the stabilisation of prices over 1938 has also helped.    With the installation of new plant,  capacity should be increased to 14 m.  tons a year by the end of 1933.    Exports of iron and steel in December (197,000 tons) were 8,000 tons less than in December, 1936, and imports (288,000 tons) were 193,000 tons more,  the increase being due mainly to pig iron. Exports for 1937 were 17% greater in volume and 35$ in value than in 1936.In Scotland new business was quieter, but works, have enough orders to keep them busy during the first half of the year.    Increased supplies of imported semis were available.
On the North East Coast, home demand is still so good as to make export difficult. The ore supply position is much improved.In Sheffield,  the raw material position is now more satisfactory,  demand for &quot;basic steel,  and stainless steels is still high.In South Wales,  tinplate activity slackened to 61% of capacity owing to the holidays but deliveries exceeded output.    Demand for heavy finished steel continues good.ENGINEERING.    Towards the end of 1937 there were indications of a recession in demand but the slackening may be merely temporary.    The home market is well provided for in the near future by the increasing number of Defence orders.    Exports of machinery amounted to  4.95m as compared with  3.64m in December, 1936.    Imports ( 1.99m) were  368,000 more.MOTOR INDUSTRY.  The number of motor vehicles newly registered in November was 27,864 - 4,259 less than a year before;    the decrease in private cars was 3,156.    The production of private cars in October was 26,977 (12.6% less than in October, 1936) and of commercial vehicles 9,627 (6.9% less).    Exports of new private cars and chassis in December amounted to 8,010 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,177 - 1.495 and 19.8% respectively, less than in December, 1936.    Imports of complete new private cars were 1,234 as compared with 1 ,.974 a year ago.NON-FERROUS METALS. Metal markets were steady around the low levels reached in November.    Trade or speculative interest was slight but there was little selling pressure. Consumers in this country were,  as usual, disinclined to buy much in the last weeks of the year.
4 A *.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.  There was a slight improvement in the position of the industry in December.    In heavy engineering nome and foreign orders declined compared with November, and were considerably less than a year ago.    Exports of electrical  apparatus and machinery ( 1.8 million) were 19. 2% more than in December 1956;    electricity generated was 14,7$ more. -COTTON. The fall in activity in November was intensified and production declined in all sections.    Immediate prospects are very uncertain.      The daily yarn output index (1935 = 100) was 112 was compared with 117 in November.    Activity declined in the  manufacturing end finishing sections also.    Raw cotton-prices increased slightly.    Yarn margins were maintained under the price agreements.    Yarn exports at 11.0 in. lbs. were slightly less, than in November and 1.3 m.  less than in December,  1956.    Exports of piece goods at 1.41 m.  square yards were 10 m. less than in November and 29 m. less than in December, 1956.    Compared with November,  exports to British Vieet Africa were 9.7 m.  square yards less and exports to Colombia and Switzerland also fell appreciably.    Exports to British India, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa increased.WOOL.  There was a further decline in general activity during December in most sections.    Exports of tops and yarns were  considerably less,  and exports of tissues slightly less in volume than in December,  1956.    Raw wool prices . hardened slightly, however,  and are setting a more hopeful tone.SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.Rayon. There was a seasonal slackening in yarn demand from the weaving- trade but latterly an improvement was noticeable.    Crepe yarns were in poor demand and hosiery yarns quiet.    There were indications of a slight improvement
-I AOin demand for staple fibre.    In the piece goods trade &quot;business in plains and jacquards was extremely quiet but the print trade was more satisfactory.    Exports of yarns and all-rayon fabrics and mixtures showed an increase over December, 193 6. Silk. The Christmas retail sales of silk goods are understood to have exceeded expectations.HIDES AND LEATHER. Early in December hide markets tended to advance but later were much quieter owing to the holidays.    In the leather industry some sections showed signs of increasing activity but in all cases business vas below normal.CHEMICALS. A slight  reduction in exports of heavy chemicals compared with November was offset &quot;by increased home sales.    Deliveries of chlorine products showed a considerable increase over December,  1936.    Home sales of dyestuffs improved but in the textile trade business was quiet.      Exports of dyestuffs were greater than a year before.    Home sales of fertilisers continued at a lower level than in 1936 but exports have considerably increased particularly to Empire markets.    New business in tar products was still rather difficult.    The market for wood distillation products remained good.    Business in pharmaceutical chemicals was quiet.POTTERY. Employment in November was at much the same level as a year before.    Demand for earthenware was disappointing and towards the end of the month there was a seasonal slackening in the demand for china.    The tile section continued active.    As compared with 1936 home sales of sanitary earthenware fell considerably.BUILDING.  E/^turns received from 140 Local Authorities show that the estimated cost of buildings for which plans were approved was . 9.8 m. , an increase of  1.1 m.  over December 1956.    There was an increase of 35.5% for dwelling houses (lminly in Scotland) and decreases of 1.6% for factories and of        fftr-all other buildings and alterations of existing buildings.
1C. \J ijRETAIL TRADE. The money value of retail sales in November was 7.1% higher than in November, 1936.    Sales of food and perishables increased in value by 9.0% and of other-merchandise by 5.0%.    Preliminary returns for December indicated a small increase over December, 1936.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (SCOTLAND). After a promising opening of the Autumn season the drapery trade experienced a setback which continued owing to the milder weather and uncertainty regarding the wool market.    Trade in the furniture etc. departments increased and allied factories were fully employed;COLONIAL TRADE.    Imports into Colonial territories during 1937 generally increased considerably over 1936.    The fall in commodity prices in recent months - in most cases Colonial producers are still left with a reasonable margin of profit - and the reduction of export quotas under the rubber,  tin and copper agreements,  consequent on the decreased demand,  will, however, he reflected in due course in smaller imports.AUSTRALIAN TRADE. During the five months ended 30th November,  2,318,000 hales of wool were received into store as compared with 2,203,000 a year before, the quantities sold or shipped being $53,000 and 1,082,000, respectively. Wheat and flour shipments from 1st December, 1936,  to 30th November were equivalent to 99.18 m. bushels.    The wheat crop for 1937/38 is estimated at 163 m. bushels - 12 m. more than last season.    Butter exports from 1st July to 1st January were 41,000 tons as compared with 34,000 a year before.    Imports of merchandise during November amounted to  15.54 m.  (Australian currency) as compared with  9.87 m. in November, 1936.NEW ZEALAND TRADE.The favourable trade balance for the eleven months January/November 1937,  declined by  1.7 m. (N.Z. currency) as compared with 1936.    Total exports for the
same period rose in value &quot;by 18.8$ the main increases being in wool, butter and cheese,    Imports were the highest since 1920.    Internal economic conditions continued good, and the value of factory production for 1936-7 was an all-time record.    The official estimate of wool production for 1937-0 is 5$ over the previous year,SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE, The general rate of expansion appears to be slowing down.    During the current year economic activity seems likely to continue at about the present level. Imports in October were 18.7$ greater than in October, 1936. Exports (excluding gold) were 19.4$ more, due largely to increased shipments of diamonds, maize and fruit;    wool exports fell appreciably,.    Gold exports were 1.7$ more. Owing to the unfavourable croR outlook an embargo was placed on maize exports as from 15th December.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.Argentina.    British exports to and imports from Argentina for January/November increased in value by 31$ and 37$ respectively as compared with the year before.    Total shipments from Argentina to all countries for the same period increased by 49.5$ over 1956 in value.    Reports of crop prospects are discouraging owing tc frosts   and draughts.    The exportable surplus of wheat&quot;, for 1958 is estimated at 2,6 m, tons as compared with 4.2 m.  tons in 1957, but prices are higher than a year ago.Brazil, The default on the foreign debt has been accompanied by stringent currency restrictions.    The export surplus for January/September fell from  6.14 m,  in 1956 to  5.90 m.  in 1957.    Coffee exports are still below norma^ and the future of the industry is uncertain.Uruguay. A fall of 50$ in wool prices led to a sharp decline in shipments.    The amount of foreign exchange available to importers fell correspondingly.    Some
modifications in the system of exchange control were introduced.Chile. The export surplus for January/October was 493.8 m pesos compared with 180.4 m. pesos a year before
