(THIS DOCuHENT 13 TITS PROPERTY OF HIS BBITAI^TIC MAJES TY&apos; S GOVERN MER T) .COPY Ho.SECRET.CP. Ho. 11/1%.C A B I IT E TINDIA.Appreciation of&quot; the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 21st January, 1938.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situation in India, dated&quot; the 21st January, 1938, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.Congress Ministries and Congress leaders generally have been compelled by events to define yet further their attitude towards agitation accompanied by violent speaking or incitement to violence, and it is now apparent that the Congress executive do not intend to allow their own programme of approach to the masses to be anticipated by attempts on the part of the left wing to promote premature disorder.      The first open breach on this subject has arisen out of an agrarian situation. There are few provinces which do not report some form of difficulty in the recovery of rents or other dues owing to the extravagant expectations which have been aroused among the rural population.     During December matters came to a head in Bihar, where the activities of Swami Sahjanand and the Kisan Sabha were rapidly leading to lawlessness and had resulted in several murders and riots connected with the collection of dues.The Bihar Congress Working Committee accordingly adopted a resolution condemning Kisan propaganda and directing Congress workers to keep aloof from such activities, and the activities of the Kisan Sabha have since been generally opposed by Congress and its supporters.      The Orissa Ministry has also been obliged to issue a communique warning tenants against listening to propaganda directed against payment of legal dues to landlords.      In the United Provinces, where the financial position was seriously threatened by the no-rent campaign, the Ministry have also issued a communique warning tenants that they have no authority to resist the payment of
OAcurrent dues and that their own interests will be injured by the enforcement of measures for collection.The Congress Working Committee, at its meeting held in Bombay at the beginning of January,  endorsed the action of the Bihar Congress and Babu Ra.jeh.dr a Pi-as ad has since issued a statement strongly condemning the action ox the Kisan Sabha in Bihar and warning them that, if the situation does not improve, disciplinary action will have to be taken in the terms of the resolution of the forking Committee.2.      In connection with the prosecution of Parmanand, to which reference was made in the last appreciation, the United Provinces Government have also defined their attitude towards violent speaking,  such as that commonly resorted to by the esr-Kakori convicts.On the strength of Parmanand1s imprisonment aar another offence at Delhi they have dropped the prosecution but, in doing so, they have issued a general warning to the effect that violent speeches will not be permitted and that they will hold themselves free to institute proceedings without further warning against any individual   who offends in this manner.      This communique also has met with general approval and an article in gandhis paper, the &quot;Harijan&quot;, has since emphasised the fact that liberty does not mean licence and that Congress will not tolerate violence in either speech or action and will use the provisions of the criminal law against persons guilty of incitement to violence.3.     Nehru convened a meeting of the Congress Working Committee in Bombay at the beginning of January to review the work of the Congress ministries, more particularly in regard to their action to uphold lav/ and order.      Gandhi,
whose health still prevents him from taking an active part in Congress proceedings, was not present at the meeting, but was sufficiently near for consultation with its members.     probably somewhat to Nehru&apos;s surprise, the meeting resulted in a decisive victory for the right wing. A resolution was passed approving of the work so far done by Congress ministries and emphasising the importance of adhering to the Congress policy of non-violence and discouraging all iricitss&amp;ent to violence.      It was added that, despite every desire to avoid coercive action, ministries would inevitably have to undertake it In the event- of violence or incitement to violence or communal strife.4.      The field where these issues will eventually be. fought out between the two wings of Congress will be the annual session at Haripura, which is to take place in February.      The elections of delegates to this Congress have been in progress in all. provinces and since the -relative strength of the two wings will determine the compositions of the All-India Congress Committee, strenu&amp;us efforts have been made on both sides to secure tit return of their own supporters.      These elections have been attended by considerable rowdiness and other mal practices, which have drawn forth the strong condemnation of the Working Committee.      In Bengal the validity of the elections has already been challenged in respect of nearly 200 out of 507 candidates,- So far as information is available it appears that the right wing has more than maintained its strength, partly owing to the differences in the Congress Socialist party,  among whom the Socialists proper are now at loggerheads with the avowed communists.      The left wing-candidates will, however, include a certain number of
revolutionaries and terrorists who are either ex-convicts or released, detenus5 and with Subhas Chandra Boss now assured of election to the Presidentship it must remain doubtful how far the genuine right wing of Congress will be able to maintain its held over the policy of that body.5.      The power of Congress has met with a serious challenge in another direction owing to the success of the Moslem League in extending its membership and Moslem League candidates have recently succeeded against Congress candidates in three Moslem bye-elections in the United Provinces.      Shortly after the meeting of the Working Committee, there was an interchange ox published statements between Hehru and Jinnah, in which Nehru somewhat contemptuously offered tc listen to Moslem proposals while Jinnah offered in return to listen to Congress proposals.     Meanwhile, the efforts of Congress to secure an understanding with the Moslems have exposed them to an attack from the rear on the part of the Hindu Mahasabha, which has somewhat inconveniently exposed the essentially Hindu character of the Congress movement.6.      The response ox Congress to the left wing appeal for direct action is to initiate or promote constructive measures of a spectacular character likely to- appeal to the masses and attention is evidently being directed to this object by the various Congress Ministers.      The Madras Government has already issued orders introducing reduced rates of pay for its provincial and subordinate services.      The new scales will not apply to Government servants appointed before 1st April unless they are subsequently promoted to a higher service or post.     Other ministries have similar schemes under consideration for
reducing what they regard as the excessive cost of public services.Three Governments have announced a policy of reforming the system of honorary magistrates and,  in particular, the United Provinces Government proposes to terminate the appointment of all such magistrates and to appoint new men under their own conditions.      There is some danger that these operations will merely involve the substitution of Congress nominees.   .  The Madras Legislature has recently referred an important and contentious Agriculturists&apos; Belief Bill to a select committee while the Bihar Legislature has passed a Tenancy Amendment Act, which represents a compromise &quot;between the landlords &apos; and tenants 1 interests,     The Madras Government again have introduced prohibition in one district and,  as a result of two months1 experience, express complete satisfaction with the results. Prohibition schemes are also under consideration in six o ther pr ov i no e s.7.      The economic position has been slightly improved by winter rains in the United Provinces, the Punjab and the Korth-v/est Frontier Province, but the rainfall received is insufficient in some areas.     Elsewhere the crop prospects continue to be satisfactory.8.      The situation in Y/aairistan has continued to improve, and only minor incidents have occurred.      The withdrawal of additional troops has continued.      The Faqir of Ipi is still in the aadda Khel country and appears to be doing his best, &quot;without much success, to revive hostilities.
