THIS DOCULESIOT IS THE mOFERTX OP HIS BRITAI-SflC MAJESTY&apos;S -GOVISMLIEMT.20(38).     SCOTTISH MARRIAGE LAJ7.Memorandum by the Secretary^ of State^fpr Scotland.In December 1935, my predecessor appointed a Committee, under theChairmansliip of Lord Horison, to onquire into and report upon the law ofScotland relating to the constitution of marriage, and to recommend what changes, if any, are desirable,     (Tho immediate occasion of the enquiry was what are known as the &quot;Gretna&quot; marriages.)     This Committee reported inDecember, 193S.     Its recommendations have &quot;been carefully examined in thelight of the representations u-oon them which have reached me during the past3rear, and the developments which have taken place since that date,     I am satisfied, that the introduction of legislation amending the Scottish marriagelaw can no longer ho delayed.At present marriages in Sootlond fall into two &quot;broad categories -&quot;regular&quot; and &quot;irregular&quot;,     A &quot;regular&quot; marriage is one celebrated &quot;by a minister of Religion &quot;before at least two witnesses after due publication ofbanns, or after statutory notice to the Registrar.     &quot;Irregular&quot; marriagesfall into three classes -(l) Marriage by declaration.In this, marriage is constituted simplj1- by the exchange of consent, oral or in writing, either before witnesses or in private, between the parties.     No notice of any land is required.    Many marriages bjr declaration are subsequently registered by a warrant granted on application to the Sheriff but there is no compulsion to do so  and the figure of about 4,000 marriages so registered annually - some&apos; 12;i of the registered marriages in Scotland - represents only a proportion of the total marriages of this kind.     The exact proportion is not capable of estimate.     The procedure connected with such marriages frequentlj1- costs more than the celebration of a &quot;regular&quot; marriage.     The Gretna marriages are merelj1- marriages by declaration taking place in the village of Gretna, and there is no reason -whatever in the present state of the law why similar marriages should not take place in ever3r villago in Scotland,     Last year, in fact, at least one competing &quot;shcp&quot;was opened in Gretna itself.(2) Marriage by promise subsenuente copula,This form of marriage is established ty proof (by writing or oath) of a promise of marriage by one part2r followed ty intercourse nn the faith of that promise,     This form of marriage, though now very rare, is by. no means unknown.
9 0, ^W o J(3) Marriage by habit and repute.This has been defined as follows-&quot;Habit and repute arises from parties cohabiting together openly and constantly as if they were husband and wife and so conducting themselves towards each other for such a length of time in the society or neighbourhood of which they are members as to produce a general belief that they are married persons&quot;.     This method of constituting marriage still exists and in the administration, for instance, of the Pensions Acts we encounter each year some six new cases in none of the types of &quot;irregular&quot; marriage is there any requirement for the registration of the marriage.     The Sheriff may, as has &quot;been said above, grant a warrant for its registration (on application made within three months after a marriage by declaration), but otherwise am &quot;irregular&quot; marriage can be established as having taken place only by means of an action of declarator in the Court Of Session. 3. So far as conoerns &quot;regular&quot; marriages, the Committee found that thepresent law is generally satisfactory and recommended only three modifications, namely:-(l) that power to proclaim a marriage and to issue banns should baconferred on Churches other than the Church of Scotland; (2) that provision should &quot;be made for permitting the use in Scotland of a certificate issued by the Registrars of England and Ireland under the English and Irish statutes;, and (3) that a marriage contracted by a minor in Scotland with a foreigner should &quot;be null and vaid unless the consent of the minor&apos;s parent or guardian is given. 4. I do not propose that the recommendations relating to regular marriagesshould be adopted.     The first is based on the assumption that the proclamation of banns by the Church of Scotland is an ecclesiastical privilege, whereas its real purpose is to secure publication of the intended marriage in what has long been regarded as a convenient local centre for the purpose.     Moreover, the prescription of other Churches to whom the privilege of proclaiming banns might be given would be a difficult and controversial matter.     As regards the second proposal, the matter, so far as it affects England and Scotland, is the subject of aPrivate/
o onhi rj   \Private Member&apos;s Bill at present before Parliament.     As to the third, I am not satisfied that, on the merits, it is sound.In the case of &quot;irregular&quot; marriages the Committee recommended that the system should be abolished and replaced by a simple and inexpensive form of civil marriage before a Registrar.     I think that this recommendation, so far as concerns marriages by declaration and marriages by promise subsequente copula is justified by the facts.       The present law of &quot;irregular&quot; marriages, in the case of these two categories, is not only susceptible of unscrupulous exploitation (as G-retna Green and its periodical scandals show) but frequently leaves in doubt the validity of a marriage and consequently the status of children born of it.      These doubts are of increasing importance even to the parties immediately concerned, in view of the Pensions Acts.It is, in any case, highly undesirable that marriage should be capable of being contracted on the spur of the moment without the slightest public notice whatever, even of an hour.The same arguments do not, however, apply in the case of marriages by habit and repute, and I am not satisfied that the committee was right in recommending that the Court should no longer be entitled to infer that matrimonial consent had been exchanged,and. therefore that marriage had taken place, from the fact that the parties had, over a long period, lived together and been regarded as man and wife.      A somewhat comparable power to presume a marriage is I understand possessed by the Coul^t in other countries, including England, and to abolish the Scottish marriage by habit and repute might, I think, be regarded as unnecessary interference, for the sake of completeness,with a tradition of very long standing, whose abolition might lead to confusion and undesired results.      The number of cases in question is, as I have indicated, very small, and their possibility could not be exploited in the same way as can that of marriage by declaration-I propose, therefore, that the existing forms of irregular marriage by declaration and by promise subsequente copula should be abolished forthwith.&apos;     In place of them I should propose, following the recommendation of the Committee, to provide for civil marriages before a Registrar. Notice of any such marriage would require to have been given to the Registrar, and only persons who have been actually resident in Scotland for atleast/
15 days prior to that notice could avail themselves of the new procedure. Marriages celebrated in accordance with this procedure would- of course, be registered and the status of the parties, and of aiiy children of the marriage, would be easily proved,,I ask the authority of my colleagues for the preparation and submission to the Committee of Home Affairs of a Bill giving effeut to the proposals which I have outlined.4th February, 1933.
