Paper No. 1381-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Zinc Imports Sub-Committee (OLD. Paper No. 1381-B).SIR ARTHUR ROBINSON, in introducing the Report on behalf of Lord Riverdale, who had been unable to attend, referred to the covering note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, in which it was suggested that most of the issues involved were more appropriate for consideration by the Cabinet.From the defence aspect, two points had been thrown up during the investi-gations of the Committee. The first was that the Canadian production was just as important as the Home production, and it was, therefore, essential that an agreement should be reached by the Home and Canadian interests regarding the points at issue. The Canadian producers had expressed their willingness to do this.In view of Lord Swinton&apos;s reference to the Canadian Governments attitude to Canadians joining the Royal Air Force, he would like to draw attention to paragraph 30, in which it was stated : &quot;In this connection we are happy to record the specific assurance given in evidence by Mr. Warren and Mr. McNab, that in an emergency the entire output of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company and the Hudson Bay Company, less only so much as might be required for domestic consumption in Canada, would be at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. We should have felt even more reassured had a definite undertaking by the Government of Canada been forthcoming.&quot; In view of the present attitude of the Canadian Government, he felt a little doubtful as to the value of this assurance.The second point was the difficulty of supplying, in an emergency, the high-grade zinc necessary for the manufacture of cartridge case brass, &amp;c. The necessity for holding a reserve of this material had been impressed on the Committee, but they did not feel it was a matter which they, within their terms of reference, could pursue. They had, however, mentioned it in their Report and suggested that an investigation might be carried out by the Sub-Committee on the Accumulation of Reserves of Essential Raw Materials. The latter Sub-Committee already had this under consideration.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : (i) That the Report of the Sub-Committee on Zinc Imports (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1381-B) should be remitted to the Cabinet, (ii) That the Sub-Committee on the Accumulation of Reserve Stocks of Essential Raw Materials  should  be instructed  to  consider  the desirability of the acquisition of a reserve of high-grade zinc in the United Kingdom and to submit proposals. ******2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, January 13, 1938.[&quot;16499a]

I would draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that during the enquiry the Canadian zinc producers were given an opportunity of appearing before the Sub-Committee and giving evidence in accordance with the request contained in letter dated the 23rd February, 1937, from the Prime Minister of Canada, which is attached as Appendix II to the Report.3. In my opinion, as the recommendations of the Sub-Committee involve matters of policy, the Report should be submitted to the Cabinet, but I would suggest that the recommendation contained in paragraph 44 (k) regarding the acquisition of a reserve of high-grade zinc in the United Kingdom should be referred forthwith for consideration by the Sub-Committee on the Accumulation of Reserve Stocks of Essential Raw Materials.(Initialled) T.

REPORT.Section I. Introduction.WE were appointed a Committee in May 1937, with the following Terms of Reference : &quot; To make inquiry into the question of zinc imports into this country from the point of view of defence, and generally, and to advise, inter alia, as to the situation in regard to import duties on zinc.&quot;2. In considering the best method of approach to the problem we felt that both by reason of the source from which we derived our authority, and by our terms of reference, our main consideration should be that of national defence. We nevertheless concluded that the interests of trade generally, and in particular the export trade, should not be subordinated to the requirements of national defence beyond the degree which the merits of the case required. We accordingly deemed it advisable to invite all the more important interests in the United Kingdom who have any concern with zinc, either as producers, importers, distributors or consumers, whether directly or indirectly, to tender evidence if they so desired. In these circumstances evidence was invited from the witnesses whose names are set out in Appendix I.3. We had due regard to the undertaking recorded in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s letter,* dated the 23rd February, 1937, attached to the Trade Agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in Canada, dated the 23rd February, 1937, and an invitation to give evidence before the Committee was extended through the Dominions Office to the Consoli-dated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada and to the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company. This invitation was accepted and Mr. J. J. Warren, the President of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, and Mr. A. J. McNab of the Hudson Bay Company came from Canada to appear before the Committee.4. It is not necessary to discuss in detail the whole of the evidence tendered to the Committee, but in general it may be said that the importers, distributors and consumers were concerned that metal should be available in the United Kingdom at nearly the world price. The Canadian producers, and, in particular, the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, who have a very low production cost, were concerned to preserve a market for their products, and were not, from their particular standpoint, greatly interested in price maintenance. They were, however, prepared in the interests of the industry generally to consider any scheme, provided it did not call for what they might regard as undue sacrifice on their part. The Imperial Smelting Corporation on the other hand were concerned to preserve a secure market with a certain minimum price for their output. We comment in greater detail on the evidence given by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company and by the Imperial Smelting Corporation later in this Report.5. Before doing so, however, it will perhaps conduce to a clearer view of the problem if we set out briefly the history of the zinc industry in the United Kingdom and in other Empire countries.Section II. History of Recent Developments in the Zinc Industry in the United Kingdom and other Empire Countries.Situation in 1914.6. On the outbreak of war in 1914 the output of zinc in the United Kingdom was some 60,000 tons a year, of which the greater part was derived from secondary materials. Consumption was approximately 200,000 tons a year, and over .80 per cent, of imports were derived from Belgium and Germany, which then* Appendix II.
exercised virtual control of the world zinc industry outside of America. The outbreak of war cut off the United Kingdom from the greater part of its normal supplies of zinc, ,and it was necessary to turn to the United States of America as the only available source from which to obtain the greatly increased quantities of zinc which were required. At that time there was no commercial production of zinc in Canada. The result was that in 1915 high grade zinc touched the record price of  160 per ton.Erection of plant with Government assistance.7. The output of zinc concentrates in Australia, amounting to about 400,000 tons a year, was practically wholly under contract to a group of German interests. Legislation was enacted by the Australian House of Representatives to free the Australian mines from their obligations under these long-term contracts. There were thus large supplies of concentrates coming forward for which no adequate smelting capacity was available. At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government were in difficulties in obtaining the required quantities of fine zinc. In these circumstances financial assistance was provided by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the erection of an electrolytic plant in Tasmania and for the extension of a plant at Port Pirie. A contract was also entered into in August 1915 with the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada to supply a quantity of fine zinc. This contract led to the setting up of the plant from which the present undertaking of the Company has been developed.8. In 1917 also His Majesty&apos;s Government provided financial assistance for the setting up of a new smelting plant in the United Kingdom at Avonmouth and for the development of a plant at Swansea Vale. Had the zinc refining capacities of Overseas Empire countries at that time been what they are to-day, this course would not have been necessary. The plants at Avonmouth and Swansea Vale are now the property of the Imperial Smelting Corporation. Other plants at that time in existence in the United Kingdom have, in the main, either gone out of production or been absorbed by the Corporation.Position under the Import Duties Act, 1932, and the Ottawa Agreement.9. The Import Duties Act, 1932, imposed a duty of 10 per cent, ad valorem on foreign zinc, and the Ottawa Agreements of 1932 with Canada and Australia guaranteed the continuance of this duty on condition that Empire producers met the requirements of United Kingdom consumers at the world prices. Empire zinc has been at all times free of duty. The Empire producers became dissatisfied with the working of the condition regarding supply at the world price, which was taken to be the price on the London Metal Exchange, and represented that its observance resulted in that price being unduly depressed. The matter was referred to the Import Duties Advisory Committee, who recommended the replacement of the duty of 10 per cent, ad valorem by a duty of 12s. 6d. a ton, the Empire producers being relieved of the obligation to supply all consumers&apos; needs or to sell at world prices. The agreement between producers and consumers which led up to this recommendation provided that the Import Duties Advisory Committee might recommend the suspension of the duty if the price of zinc was likely to remain at not less than  15 a ton. The Committee&apos;s Report also stated that should the results of these measures prove unsatisfactory they would not hesitate to recommend such measures as might prove to be necessary to protect the home industry against any external competition. The existing duty is, however, conventionalised by the Trade Agreements at present in force between the United Kingdom on the one hand and Norway and Poland on the other.Cartel discussions.10. International understandings of various kinds had existed in the zinc industry in the past, and in 1936, owing to the low price of zinc, efforts were made to reach a new international arrangement. The basis of the proposed arrangement was a limitation of production by the main producing countries when the price of zinc fell. The discussions ended, however, without any agree-ment being reached, mainly, it is stated, because of the refusal of the German industry to set any limit to its expansion.
^Negotiations between Empire producers.11. When the cartel discussions failed the United Kingdom Industry applied to the Government for assistance, and suggested that it might take various forms. One suggestion was a subsidy to the industry and a quota regulation of imports. Another was that certain quantities should be imported from each country at a low rate of duty or free of duty, and all imports in excess of these quantities, whether from foreign or Empire countries, should pay a high rate of duty, the amount to be imported free or at a low rate of duty to vary with the current price of zinc. It was pointed out that the right of free entry into the United Kingdom of Dominion goods had been given at Ottawa, and must be regarded as a major part of the trade policy of the United Kingdom Government. The industry was advised, therefore, to try to reach some separate arrangement with the other Empire producers.12. In the summer of 1936 Captain O. Lyttelton of the British Metal Corporation (and also a Director of the Imperial Smelting Corporation), discussed with Mr. Warren, the President of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, the lines of an Empire understanding, the object being to ensure that the volume of the United Kingdom production was safeguarded in case of a fall in the price of zinc. The basis of the discussion was that a higher duty should be placed on foreign spelter and that the Empire producers would then agree to reduce their imports into this country, and the United Kingdom industry would reduce its production, when the price of zinc fell below an agreed level, it being thought that by this means a remunerative level of price might be maintained. So far there seems to have been little difficulty, but the United Kingdom industry also wanted a provision that in no circumstances should it be required to reduce its production below 70,000 tons a year. This was opposed by Mr. Warren.13. After considerable discussion a tentative proposal was drafted and initialled by Mr. Warren, for the Canadian Mining and Smelting Company, and Captain Lyttelton. A copy of this document is reproduced as Appendix III. It will be seen that it involved the imposition of a higher duty followed by a reduction of supply to this market when the price fell below  16 10s. a ton, the lowest price the Imperial Smelting Corporation regarded as remunerative to them at the time. The reduction was to be brought about by the Imperial Smelting Corporation reducing their output by 1\ per cent., and the Canadian producers reducing their exports to this market by 5 per cent, for each agreed unit move-ment in price. Mr. Warren was to try to obtain the agreement of the other Canadian producer, the Hudson Bay Company, and Captain Lyttelton was to seek the agreement of the Imperial Smelting Corporation and of the Australian and Rhodesian interests.14. The price of zinc continued to be very low in the Autumn of 1936, and the Imperial Smelting Corporation were dissatisfied with the proposals made by Mr. Warren. They closed their works at Seaton Carew and Bloxwich, and approached the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence as to the requirements of the Government for zinc in an emergency and the minimum production the Government regarded as essential in this country. Eventually, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence told the Imperial Smelting Corporation that, in his view, a domestic production of 70,000 tons of zinc a year was essential to national security.15. Efforts were thereupon made by the Imperial Smelting Corporation to induce Mr. Warren to reconsider the terms of the draft proposals, but this he refused, partly on the ground that it was improper for the Corporation to go back to the British Government to try to force a modification of the draft proposal, and formally withdrew his agreement to the proposals on the 15th December, 1936. This position existed at the date of our appointment as a Committee.16. Details of production and apparent home consumption of the Empire countries concerned in this industry are set out in Appendix IV. It will be seen that in 1936 Empire output of zinc was in excess of the requirements of the Empire markets. In these circumstances, the imposition of a duty against foreign metal only would not^ be sufficient to safeguard the United Kingdom industry, apart from the fact &quot;that the existing duty is conventionalised in the Trade Agreements with Norway and Poland.
17. The real issue is, therefore, that of the relations between the United Kingdom producers (i.e., the Imperial Smelting Corporation) on the one hand, and the rest of the Empire producers (especially the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada) on the other, and it is for this reason that it is proposed to discuss at some length the evidence tendered by the two producers.Section III. The Present Position of the Industry and Considerationof the Evidence tendered.Imperial Smelting Corporation.  Capacity and output.18. The plants of the Imperial Smelting Corporation at Avonmouth, Swansea Vale, Seaton Carew and Bloxwich have a total nominal capacity for the production of zinc metal amounting to some 87,000 tons per annum. The Corporation is a &quot; Customs smelter,&quot; i.e., a smelter who does not mine or control any of the ores which he treats, as opposed to the &apos;&apos; miner smelter &apos;&apos; owning or controlling a mine. The &quot; Customs smelter &quot; buys his concentrates on the full metal content value, less only a deduction for unavoidable losses in process and an allowance to cover the costs of treatment and profit. The concentrates are purchased on contracts which provide in general that the price of the concentrates shall vary with the price of the metal. Under this arrangement the major benefit from a rise in price accrues to the producer of the concentrates and not to the smelter. In these circumstances a &quot; Customs smelter &quot; cannot offset an increase in processing costs against profits on concentrates. The Corporation^ plants have never been working to capacity, their maximum output being about 65,000 tons in 1936.Sources of concentrates.. 19. The Imperial Smelting Corporation purchase their concentrates mainly from Australia and Newfoundland. There is a small United Kingdom production of zinc ore amounting in 1935 to a little over 2,000 tons, which is generally purchased by the Corporation, who also take occasional parcels of ore from Burma, Yugoslavia and other countries.Sulphuric acid production.20. The Imperial Smelting Corporation produce, as a by-product from the manufacture of zinc, a substantial quantity of sulphuric acid, and if the plants were working to capacity the output of sulphuric acid would amount to about 131,000 tons of 100 per cent. acid. This is an important consideration in relation to an emergency, to which we refer later in this Report.Desideratum on price.21. As stated in paragraph 11 above, at the time of the discussion with the Canadian producers, the Imperial Smelting Corporation considered that a price of  16 10s. per ton, as a basis to be aimed at under any scheme for the protection of the United Kingdom industry, would be adequate. In their evidence before us the Imperial Smelting Corporation stated that, taking into account the increase in wages and fuel prices which had supervened since that date, the minimum price at which the United Kingdom industry could operate on a satis-factory basis would be  22 per ton, if costs remained at their present level.Process and production costs.22. The process employed by the Imperial Smelting Corporation is a heat distillation process, while that in use in other Empire producing countries is an electrolytic process employing hydro-electric power. The former is not only less flexible as regards output adjustment, but as the proportion of labour costs is much higher it is more susceptible to the influence of variations in wages, and costs of coal and coke. In other-words, the production costs of the electrolytic method are both cheaper and more stable than those of the distillation process. It was represented1 to us on behalf of the Imperial Smelting Corporation that assistance should be afforded to them to meet these conditions, which were referred to as a costs differential.
Imperial Smelting Corporation^ proposals.23.   The proposal originally put to us by the Imperial Smelting Corporationwas:- (i) An adequate import duty on foreign metal;(ii) Import quotas on Empire metal;(iii) Orderly marketing through a central selling organisation.24. Alternative proposals were a duty of  2 per ton on all imports of zinc into the United Kingdom or a subsidy of  1 10s. per ton on the output of the Imperial Smelting Corporation, the subsidy to vary with the dividend which the Corporation paid on their ordinary share with the proviso that in the event of that dividend being 5 per.cent, or more no subsidy should be payable.25. A variation of the duty proposal was .also put to us by a witness who, while not appearing before us as a representative of the Imperial Smelting Corporation, was himself a director of that Corporation. His proposal was that a premium of  2 per ton should be paid on all imported zinc coming on to the United Kingdom market, with a rebate to Empire zinc of 12s. Qd. per ton, the proceeds of the fund so created to be handed over to the Imperial Smelting Corporation as a subsidy. The effect of this proposal is a duty on foreign zinc of  2 per ton and a duty of  1 7s. Qd. per ton on Empire zinc, with a concomitant subsidy to the Imperial Smelting Corporation, and is a combination of the proposals referred to in paragraph 24 which would result in a much higher effective subsidy than is there suggested.26. None of these proposals, even if it were otherwise desirable, could be adopted without consultation with the Governments of Overseas Empire countries in view of the Ottawa Agreements and the reservation recorded in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s letter of the 23rd February, 1937 (paragraph 3 supra).Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company.  Mr. Warren&apos;s evidence.27. Mr. Warren of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company in his evidence before the Committee referred to the circumstances in which the Company&apos;s zinc plant at Trail was set up during the late War and its effect on the price of zinc for His Majesty&apos;s Government at the time. He laid stress on the Ottawa Agreements, and on the letter referred to in paragraph 3 of this Report, on which he submitted that not only was the security of the United Kingdom not menaced by Canadian imports of zinc, but that Canadian produc-tion would be necessary in any future emergency. He referred also to the low cost of production which his Company enjoyed, and submitted that they should not be called upon to forgo the benefit which they derived from this source, or that that benefit should be withheld from United Kingdom fabricators. Much of his evidence related to the history of negotiations which have been briefly referred to in the earlier part of this Report, and he expressed himself as being prepared still to adhere to the understanding at which he had provisionally arrived with Captain Lyttelton in October 1936 (Appendix III). The capacity of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company is about 125,000 tons of zinc per annum, the other important Canadian producer, the Hudson Bay Company, having a capacity of about 25,000 tons per annum.United Kingdom consumption in peace and war.28. Consumption of zinc in the United Kingdom in normal times is about 200,000 tons a year. The present rate of absorption appears to be somewhat higher, at the rate of about 250,000 tons a year. Apart from the production of the Imperial Smelting Corporation, supplies.of zinc are imported mainly from Empire countries. In 1936 the United Kingdom imported 105,000 tons from Canada, 18,000 tons from Australia, 16,000 tons from Rhodesia, and about 30,000 tons from foreign countries. In that year,.as already stated, home produc-fion amounted to about 65,000 tons.29. In time of war the rate of consumption might be expected to increase owing to the demand for zinc for cartridge cases.   An estimate prepared of the
probable annual requirements of zinc in an emergency amounted to about 250,000 tons, but this may be reduced under the new War Office hypothesis. It seems unlikely, however, that requirements would fall below about 200,000 to 220,000 tons a year in emergency, particularly having regard to the growing applications of zinc in such processes as die-casting, &amp;c.Supply position in emergency.30. It will be seen from the figures of production and consumption set out in Appendix IV, that on this basis no combination of Empire producers, apart from the Imperial Smelting Corporation, could meet the requirements of the United Kingdom in an emergency. It is important to bear in mind, however, that virtually the whole of the Corporation^ output of zinc is derived from concentrates imported from Australia and Newfoundland. In an emergency it might be possible to increase the amount of concentrates drawn from Newfound-land, but owing to the limited supplies available from that source it would still be necessary for the Corporation to import large quantities of concentrates from Australia. Further, it requires approximately 2i tons of concentrates to produce 1 ton of zinc. Both these factors involve a relatively extravagant employment of freight, which is, however, mitigated to some extent by by-product output referred to in the next paragraph. The long sea route also involves a greater risk of dislocation of supplies through enemy action than in the case of importation of zinc metal from Canada, which can, if necessary, be shipped from ports in Eastern Canada. It is consequently clear that the Canadian production would represent a vital contribution to United Kingdom requirements. In this connexion we are happy to record the specific, assurance given in evidence by Mr. Warren and Mr. McNab, that in an emergency the entire output of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company and the Hudson Bay Company, less only so much as might be required for domestic consumption in Canada, would be at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. We should have felt even more re-assured had a definite undertaking by the Government of Canada been forthcoming. We leave that, however, to be pursued through the appropriate channels, observing only that our conclusions are based on the good faith of these assurances, and that had they not been forthcoming those conclusions might have been materially different.Sulphuric acid production.31. There is a further factor in regard to the United Kingdom industry which must be taken into account in connexion with our enquiry. The Imperial Smelting Corporation produce as a by-product of their zinc smelting about 120,000 tons of sulphuric acid, expressed as 100 per cent. acid. If their plant were producing to full capacity, their output would be about 131,000 tons of acid per annum. Sulphuric acid is a product of wide application and importance in industry, and particularly in an emergency. During the last war grave difficulties were encountered in the transport of acid from abroad, to make up the deficiency of domestic production. The position is different now, and there is ample home capacity for the production of all foreseeable requirements of sulphuric acid. Apart from the by-product of the Imperial Smelting Corpora-tion, however, there is only limited production from native raw materials, and the large bulk of our raw materials for this product has to be imported. The cheapest and most usual raw material is pyrites, of which Spain is the principal producer. It may well be that in an emergency supplies of pyrites from Spain would be.limited, if they did not cease altogether. The alternative raw material is elemental sulphur, of which the principal producing countries are Italy and the United States of America. Similar observations apply to Italy as to Spain, and it seems not unlikely that in any future war we should be largely dependent upon the United States of America for the necessary supplies of raw material for sulphuric acid production. It has been estimated that requirements of sulphuric acid in war would amount to some 1,200,000 tons a year. - To produce that quantity, after making allowance for the amount which could be derived from native anhydrite, would require about 300,000 tons of sulphur. It will be seen therefore. that the by-product acid of the Imperial Smelting Corporation represents an important contribution towards these requirements.[16235] c
Empire zinc production in relation to National Defence.32. On all these grounds we are of the opinion that the interests of national defence render desirable both the maintenance of the Zinc Smelting Industry in the United Kingdom and the retention of the goodwill of other Empire producers. There remains the question how far it is possible to achieve this and the means which should be adopted. In this connexion the importance of the zinc fabricating and using industries in the United Kingdom requires first consideration both on its own merit and by reference to its significance in- relation to export trade.Importance of the zinc fabricating industry.33. The application of zinc in the United Kingdom falls approximately into the following divisions : These industries have an annual production of the value of some  15,000,000 to  20,000,000 and an export trade of the value of upwards of  6,000,000 annually, while they provide employment to many thousands of workers. It has been generally admitted in the evidence which has been tendered to us that it would be exceedingly difficult to protect the zinc consuming industry from the effects of a high duty on imported zinc in the home market by increased duties on imported articles containing zinc and impracticable to introduce any satis-factory system of drawback for the export markets, and if irreparable damage is not to be done to these trades it is necessary that they should be able to obtain their zinc at a price not much in excess of world price.Consideration of the Imperial Smelting Corporations Proposals.34. It will be observed from paragraph 22 that the main argument put forward by the Imperial Smelting Corporation in support of their proposals was the necessity to afford to them a larger returning charge than that normally enjoyed by the Customs smelter. Since this returning charge is fixed in the ordinary course of bargaining between the concentrate producers and smelters at the level at which they are willing to operate, it is clear that this argument implies that spelter prices must, at all events under normal conditions of supply and demand, be fixed at a permanently higher level in this country than elsewhere, and the Corporation suggest that this should be done either by means of a duty on foreign zinc, together with quota limitation and regulated selling of Empire zinc, or, alternatively, by means of a duty on all imported zinc, both foreign and Empire.35. It will be convenient to consider first the second proposal, that for a duty on all imported zinc, and in this connexion we would refer to the suggestion by another witness that a duty of  2 per ton would suffice. From the evidence of costs which has been placed before us we are satisfied that a duty of this amount would not appreciably improve the competitive position of the Imperial Smelting Corporation in relation to the Dominion producers, and particularly the Canadians. Any duty which would be effective against the latter would have to be much higher. Apart from the effect on the fabricators and users of zinc, it is clear that such a duty would be entirely contrary to the general policy embodied in the Ottawa Agreements and would antagonise the Dominion producers, whose goodwill it is, in our view, essential to retain if this country is to be assured of supplies in an emergency.   We unhesitatingly, therefore, reject this proposal.36. So far as the Dominion imports are concerned, therefore, it appears to us essential that the position of the Imperial Smelting Corporation must be safeguarded, if possible, by agi&apos;agreement between the Dominion and British producers regulating the imports into this market.   The Australian producers,Per cent.Galvanised sheet Other sheet Brass making .&apos;. Oxide making .. Rolling ... Die casting Miscellaneous   ..19-5 23-0 25-6 14-4 9-8 5-6 2-0
we understand, already work in accord with the Imperial Smelting Corporation in regard to their imports into this country, and the Canadians, in the draft proposals initialled by Mr. Warren of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company in October 1936, have already indicated their willingness to reach agreement. So far as Empire competition alone is concerned, it appears to us that an agreement on a basis approximating to that embodied in those proposals should be satisfactory to the Imperial Smelting Corporation, and as the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company have informed us that they are still prepared to proceed on that basis, we see no difficulty in the conclusion of a satis-factory Empire agreement. In our opinion, the failure of the Imperial Smelting Corporation to proceed at the time with the negotiations on that basis last year arose from their conviction that further support would be forthcoming to enforce a modification of the provisions of that agreement in their favour.37. It will be seen, however, that those draft proposals are based on the imposition of a protective tariff against foreign zinc, and this leads to the consideration of the first proposal made by Imperial Smelting Corporation, viz., a duty on foreign zinc, together with an agreement with Empire producers. It should be noted that, while both the Imperial Smelting Corporation and the Canadian producers contemplated a duty on foreign zinc as part of the agreement, their objects are not identical. The Imperial Smelting Corporation desire a tariff to raise the price of zinc in this country above the price elsewhere, in order to increase the returning charge available to cover higher smelting costs, while the Canadians&apos; objective, subject to the agreement, was that the foreign zinc imports should be reduced before restrictions were imposed on Canadian exports to this market, and they would then probably be prepared to sell here (as contemplated in the original Ottawa Agreement),at a price approximating to the world price.38. The Imperial Smelting Corporation^ view that a tariff of  2 would meet their needs whatever the world price of zinc is based on their position as Customs smelters under the normal concentrate contracts, to which reference has been made in paragraph 18. The price of concentrates rises and falls automa-tically with the world price of zinc in such a way that the main benefit goes to the concentrate producers. The Imperial Smelting Corporation are competing for concentrates with other Customs smelters, and in particular with the Belgians, who, while using in the main the same method of production as the Imperial Smelting Corporation, enjoy the advantage of lower wage and other costs and can, therefore, work on a narrower margin. The Imperial Smelting Corporation claim that an addition of  2 to the margin enjoyed by them would redress this balance and while world fluctuations in the price of zinc would increase or reduce the margin (since the concentrate contracts provide for some part of any increase in price accruing to the smelter), on balance it would place them in a competitive position vis-a-vis the foreign Customs smelters and over a period, therefore, should enable them to operate profitably. It is clear, however, that the result would be a permanent increase, approximating to the amount of the duty, in the cost of spelter to the important fabricating and consuming industries and, for the reasons indicated in paragraph 33, we are satisfied that a duty of the amount suggested would have serious adverse effects on these industries. Moreover, while the price in this market remained above the world price by the amount of the duty, foreign zinc could be freely imported. On the other hand1, so long as the London Metal Exchange is free to operate on its present basis and its price is accepted as the world price, any attempt to secure a real preference for Canadian imports by fixing the price in this market at a level below the London Metal Exchange (excluding duty) price plus duty would, as the experience of the 10 per cent, duty under the original Ottawa Agreement proved, exercise a permanent depressing effect on world prices. The Belgian producers, whose original market in Germany is gradually disappearing with the movement towards self-sufficiency in that country, would make every effort to overcome the duty barrier and to maintain supplies and thus force the London Metal Exchange price down. The Empire producers would undoubtedly resent this. We cannot, therefore, regard this suggestion either as a satisfactory basis for the desired Empire Agreement or as justified in view of its adverse reactions on British industry. -39. We have already mentioned above that while the main advantage of an increase in price goes to the mine-owner concentrate producers, some advantage [16235] n
(in the example furnished to us approximately 6s. 6d. in the  ) goes to the smelters, and that at a certain level of spelter prices the Imperial Smelting Corporation can operate profitably on the normal margin. The real problem it seems to us, therefore, is to achieve a more stable level of spelter prices around the point which, with the natural premium they already may enjoy on quality and geographical location, will enable them to produce profitably. It does not appear to us that any combination of an Empire Agreement with only a moderate increase in the present duty would secure this, and we are convinced that the only satisfac-tory solution is a wider agreement embracing also the more important foreign producers with an export surplus, in particular the Belgians. With the increase in the area which is determined at all costs to make itself self-sufficient and to this end to isolate itself from world markets, the United Kingdom market becomes increasingly important as the main outlet for export production and any attempt to exclude foreign producers from this market is sure to have serious disturbing effects on the world price. Even though the ultimate equilibrium between supply and demand were not disturbed, increased Empire supplies to this country being-offset by reduction in sales in other markets, which would create new outlets for the foreign producers, it might be a long time before this equilibrium was attained and it is probable, therefore, that it would be in the interests of all producers to allow the continued entry of a reasonable quantity of foreign metal into this market. We suggest, therefore, that the agreement we propose above with the Empire producers should be regarded only as a preliminary to a wider agreement on a similar basis with the Belgians and so far as possible with other foreign producers supplying this market. We are informed that during the past Summer discussions have been renewed for the formation of an international cartel, and that it has been agreed to convene a meeting, if and when the price of zinc falls to  17 a ton, to devise action for the limitation of output on the basis of a formula which has been provisionally accepted.From our examination of the witnesses representing the Imperial Smelting Corporation who have appeared before us, we think it unlikely, however, that the Corporation can now be persuaded to conclude such an agreement with either Empire or foreign producers until they are satisfied that no further assistance, whether by way of subsidy, an increased duty, or quota regulation of imports or any combination of these features will be forthcoming from His Majesty&apos;s Government.40. It remains to be seen whether such a cartel agreement can be achieved. In the event of failure to persuade the Belgian producers to accept reasonable terms, it appears to us that only two practicable proposals remain if the position of the Imperial Smelting Corporation is to be secured. Either some form of subsidy must be provided to offset their higher costs compared with foreign Customs smelters, coupled with an Empire agreement on the lines already suggested, or this country must adopt the policy set by the United States of America and since followed by Germany and other countries, a policy of isolation behind an impregnable tariff wall, with a managed price.The third proposal put to us on behalf of the Imperial Smelting Corporation is that the output should be subsidised to the extent of  1 10s. per ton by His Majesty&apos;s Government. This proposal possesses the merit that it would involve no competitive disadvantage to the zinc consuming interests. But here again we must observe that in our opinion a subsidy of the amount suggested would not appreciably improve the Corporation^ competitive position in relation to other Empire producers. Moreover, it should be noted that this proposed subsidy is related to the dividend which the Corporation pays on its ordinary shares. In our view it arises from a desire on the part of the Corporation to ensure, so far as possible, that a minimum dividend of 5 per cent, shall be paid on its ordinary shares irrespective of the prevailing conditions of trade. We have already stated that in our view the maintenance of the zinc smelting industry in the United Kingdom is desirable, but we-are unable to admit the validity of the contention that its continued existence is, - in present circumstances, so vital to national defence that it should, at the cost of the Exchequer, be made immune from the vicissitudes of industrial conditions encountered by other productive industries. Moreover, we are not unmindful of-the objections on principle to subsidisation, with which we are not in disagreement.
Tariff proposals anal their effect on the London Metal Exchange.41. In the last resort, assuming that the Government are satisfied that the objections to a subsidy are insuperable and that the retention of the zinc smelting industry would justify such a course, it would be possible to impose a tariff high enough to exclude foreign zinc, reserving this market for home and Empire zinc. Such a measure would necessitate reconsideration of the Trade Agreements with Norway and Poland. It is clear also that in such circumstances the London Metal Exchange would cease to function as a world market fixing the world price of zinc, and, in fact, since the sales of Empire and United Kingdom zinc are already centred in two agencies in London, it would probably cease to function altogether for zinc. It would be essential that any such duty should be imposed only on the conditions : (i) That the Empire producers would give adequate assurances as to supplies (see paragraph 43 below), (ii) That the price in this market should be maintained at a level normally approximating to world level, and that when the world price fell to uneconomically low levels and the margin between United Kingdom and world prices exceeded the amount of the present duty arrange-ments should be made as far as practicable for rebates to be paid by the producers to export industries, although this presents considerable difficulty.We are unable to express any opinion as to the adverse reactions of the loss by the London Metal Exchange of its dominant position as the world zinc market, but on other grounds we would make it clear that we regard this solution as a last resort to be adopted only when it is clear that other means have failed and that conditions have so changed that foreign competition is becoming a serious threat to the existence of the Imperial Smelting Corporation. Experience in other countries, even where natural conditions favour producers, suggests that such isolation inevitably tends to create an artificially high level of prices, and we fear that in the long run the effect on the consuming industries in this country might outweigh the advantages, both economic and strategic, of the protection afforded to the Imperial Smelting Corporation.Supplies of g.o.b. and high-grade spelter.42. Another factor which has recently had an important effect on prices is the appearance in this market of disequilibrium between the supplies of ordinary ^g.o.b.) and high-grade spelter. This is understood to be a comparatively new phenomenon, at all events on the present scale. - G.o.b. spelter contains small proportions of various impurities, principally lead and other metals, while the high-grade spelter is guaranteed to contain not more than a fixed proportion of such impurities, ranging from -01 to -0001, according to quality. The London Metal Exchange price, which, up till now, had governed world prices outside the United States of America, is based on g.o.b. spelter, with premiums for the high-grade, and, under an agreement reached between the home and Empire producers and the fabricating and using industries at the time the duty was last revised, this premium was limited for the United Kingdom market to a maximum of  2 10s. per ton, but that maximum has been departed from. In the main, the different qualities are used by different industries; the galvanising industry using the g.o.b. spelter while the brass and alloy industries use almost exclusively the high-grade metal. Owing to the growth of demand for the high-grade metal for new purposes and the falling off in the galvanising industry, there has been, recently, a surplus of g.o.b. metal on this market, with an acute shortage of high-grade. Large stocks of g.o.b. have been sent to this country and are held in bond, with the result that the spelter price on the London Metal Exchange has been unduly depressed. In other markets the high-grade price has adjusted itself by abnormally high premiums, but the agreement has prevented this operating to the same extent in the United Kingdom market, with the resultant shortage. It has been suggested by witnesses that the shortage of high-grade spelter in this market is due mainly to the diversion of supplies by the Canadian producers to other more remunerative markets, and it is believed that recently substantial sales have been made at high prices to the United States of America (in spite of the tariff barrier) as well as in the Far East.[16235] d 2
43. Belgian production of zinc is, in the main, of g.o.b. quality, a relatively small proportion of high grade spelter being produced by the distillation process. The electrolytic process, on the other hand, produces entirely high grade and, in the past, a substantial proportion of the Empire imports of zinc, particularly from Canada, have been deliberately debased by the introduction of impurities, in order to compete in the market for g.o.b. It is probable that this debased electrolytic zinc has been one of the factors leading to the surplus of g.o.b. quality and.the resulting price depression. Such analysis as it is possible to make of the informa-tion available as to the demand for zinc by different industries suggests that there should be no difficulty in absorbing, in this market, the Imperial Smelting Corporation production of g.o.b. zinc, together with a reasonable quantity of Belgian zinc, and there would appear to be no difficulty in regulating the position by agreement with the Empire producers as to the proportion of debased electrolytic zinc to be imported into this market by them. We suggest that any agreement with the Empire producers should deal with this question. In con-nexion with this differentiation in the supply of and demand for the different qualities, as already indicated there is a tendency for stocks of g.o.b. zinc to accumulate in bonded warehouses, while there is at the same time a shortage of fine zinc. It was estimated that the stocks of g.o.b. zinc in the United Kingdom are at present about 30,000 to 40,000 tons. In addition, the Imperial Smelting Corporation normally carry a stock of about 100,000 tons of concentrates, * equivalent to about 45,000 tons of metal. It seems, therefore, that the position of low grade zinc in the event of an emergency is satisfactory. It is, however, the high grade metal which is mainly in demand for munitions. Of the nominal capacity of the Imperial Smelting Corporation amounting to about 87,000 tons annually, only some 6,000 tons is zinc of the highest quality. In our opinion, therefore, the question of the provision of a reserve stock of high grade zinc as an insurance against the possible interruption of supplies from Overseas Empire countries in the early stages of an emergency is a matter which requires early consideration.Section IV. Conclusions and recommendations. 44.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (a) Owing to its size, its highly competitive costs and the quality of its out-put it is essential, in the interests of national defence, to retain the goodwill of the Overseas Empire zinc-producing industry, and it is desirable that an understanding should be reached between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Canada, Australia and Rhodesia that the zinc output of the respective countries (subject to domestic requirements in each case) would be at the disposal of the United Kingdom in an emergency.(b) In the interests of national defence it is desirable to maintain the zincsmelting industry in the United Kingdom, both for its zinc production and for its by-product output, but, in view of the development of zinc production in other Empire countries, its maintenance in the United Kingdom is not so vital as to justify the adoption of any measures which would place the zinc fabricating industries in a position of serious competitive disadvantage compared with Overseas Empire or foreign fabricators.(c) The imposition of a tariff unless a very high one on all zinc would more-over, apart from the difficulty of the Ottawa Agreements and the Trade Agreements with Norway and Poland, have an adverse effect on Empire sentiment, without&apos; effectively safeguarding United Kingdom producers against Empire competitors.(d) The proper solution to the problem of Imperial competition is an agree-ment between the Empire producers, and the draft proposals prepared in October 1936 appear to offer a satisfactory basis.(e) The satisfactory working of such an agreement might necessitate the * imposition of some restriction on foreign imports.(/) A duty of the order proposed by the Imperial Smelting Corporation with only a corresponding increase in United Kingdom prices above world prices, would injure the consumers without effecting a restriction of
imports, whilst a similar duty, not reflected in United Kingdom prices, avould not satisfy the Imperial Smelting Corporation and would exercise a continuously depressing effect on world prices.(g) The Empire agreement should therefore be considered as a preliminary to an international agreement.(h) In the event of failure to achieve a satisfactory agreement with foreignproducers, the position of the Imperial Smelting Corporation could only be secured by (i) subsidy, or (ii) exclusion of foreign metal by a high tariff.(i) As regards subsidy, the maintenance of the zinc smelting industry in theUnited Kingdom is not so vital to national defence as to justify its subsidisation by His Majesty&apos;s Government so as to enable the Imperial Smelting Corporation to pay a fixed dividend on its share capital.(j) As to a high tariff, even if the obstacle of existing trade agreements could be overcome, and conditions safeguarding consumers so far as practic-able in regard to both supplies and prices were attached, we think some injury to them would be inevitable and the London Metal Exchange would probably cease to function as the dominant world market for zinc.(k) Any Empire agreement should provide assurance as to adequate supplies of high grade zinc to the United Kingdom, and immediate consiclera-tion should be given to the acquisition of a reserve of high grade zinc as an insurance against possible dislocation of imported supplies in the early stages of an emergency. s45.
