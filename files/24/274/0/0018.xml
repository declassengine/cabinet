EGRET.CP.  18(38). Oopy No. &amp;     .CABINET. BELGIAN WAR RE .aUIREMBNTs.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER FOR OO-URDINATICN CF DEFENCE.1. The Cabinet, at a meeting early in January 1957,(Cabinet 1(37) Conclusion 7) approved a Memorandum No.O.P. 8 (37) put forward by the secretary of State forForeign Affairs regarding the supply of munitions for theBelgian Army and Air Force during war, and agreed that thet/ar uffice should invite the Belgian Military Attache -(i)    to state the Belgian Government1s requirements in detail;(ii)    to explain whether it was a matter of. immediate purchases, or whether it was a matter of making arrangements now whereby purchases could be made in the event of war.The &apos;i/ar Office duly approached the Belgian Military Attache,who replied that the demand.represented war and not peacepurchases, and furnished a detailed list showing the numbers and types of stores and materials which would be needed.This list was passed to the Chairman of the Supply Board forconsideration and preparation of a co-ordinated report onthe whole of it, on material supplied by Committees of theSupply Board, itself or other Committees or Departmentsconcerned.I2.    Contact with Representatives of the Belgian Government.jThe V/ah Office have,  at the request of the Supply Board, been in touch with the Belgian Military Attache regarding certain items of the demand.      In addition, a visit was pjiid by Mr,. Lloyd of the Food (Defence Plans) Department/to Brussels, where he discussed with Major Beretze
91^(sj 1 of the Belgian War Office, who is responsible for the emergency supply arrangements in Belgium, various points connected with the food supply aspect.    During October Major Beretze   paid a return visit to England and had further consultations with the Pood (Defence Plans.) Department, and also with the Board of Trade, the War Office and the Chairman of the Supply Board.    It is also understood that Major Wouters, the Belgian Air Attache, has made contact with. the. Air Ministry, regarding the supply of aircraft and aero engines.   All these discussions have taken place on a purely hypothetical basis, and have represented largely an inter-change of ideas.    The Belgian representatives have in general shown a willingness to consider any suggestions which might prove likely to facilitate the meeting of their demand, and the organisation of supply arrangements in their own country.3. Present Position.The quantities of stores included in the Belgian demand proved in many cases to he very large and indeed, in some important respects, comparable with the estimated war requirements of the United Kingdom itself.    In consequence, the Belgian requirements have to be considered in conjunction with our nwn, and accordingly it will not, in the case of certain items, be possible to give a final answer as to our ability to meet them, until the Supply Board has completed its search for the productive capacity necessary to meet the United Kingdom needs in the first twelve months of war under the hypotheses furnished to it by the Service Departments.As, however, it is not anticipated that that stage will be reached for some time, and as, both in.fairness to the Belgians and ourselves, it seemed desirable that some statement on the question of supply during war to the Belgian Government should be made at an early date, the
Chairman of the Supply Board prepared and submitted to me in December a general survey of the position as ascertained up to that date.In this survey it was suggested that, from the supply point of view, apart from any consideration of the shipping problem, the Belgian demand might be classified under the following headings:-(A) -articles regarding the supply of which no difficulty was anticipated.Examples of these include armour plating for incorporation in tanks,  signal cartridges, flares and rockets (apart from parachutes fov flares), Anti-aircraft predictors, Radio-Equipment and most of the Medicines, Sera and Vaccines asked for.(B) Articles which could only be supplied at the expense of our own war requirements.The supply of these would involve giving them a degree of priority over our own requirements.      Itemsincluded in this group are Small Arms Ammunition,Explosives, Aircraft and Aero Engines, Guns for Tanks,Light Telephonic Cable, Fuel Oil and certain rawmaterials.(G) Cases where the adoption of the corresponding British pattern would make supply possible or facilitate it.Articles falling under this category includeAircraft and .^ero Engines, Gas Masks, Tanks, TelephoneCables, etco     A number of such cases had already beenbrought to the notice of the Belgian Government, whohave expressed a general willingness to accept british types where possible, subject to approval by them of a sample or specification which would have to be providedfor them to test or examine.      (There might, of course,be objection to complying with this request in certain cases).
(D) Oases in which supply of the article in question would he possible, &quot;put not within. the period specified in the demandcIn such cases supply has been requested in theearliest stages of an emergency, and it appearsdesirable that the Belgian Government should considerthe question off increasing their reserves of such articles to cover the period during which supply couldnot be given,,     Examples include Light Tanks andTractors and Irvine Parachutes,(E) Cases in which the articles cannot be supplied and in wKich a 7sui?abfe^..rosf&quot;reserve is recommended to be held by the Belgian Government0An example of- this is the demand for Spare Parts for Vickers Tanks,(F) 0.ases. in which the articles, or materials asked for ,,are nOi^ mariuf actured or produced i L the. United&quot; Kingdom0In such cases it was thought that the BelgianGovernment must be advised to purchase their requirementsabroad for1 themselves, subject to some arrangement where-by the Belgian and British Governments would not becompeting against each other in foreign markets, andpossibly some arrangement regarding the shipping of the stores purchased to Belgium,,     Cases of this kind ariselargely in the supply of raw materials, including oiland foodstuffs, and I understand that some of them were discussed at length in the conversations which MajorBeretze/ had with the Pood (Defence Plans) Department andthe Board of Trade, at which a representative of the directorate of Sea Transport was also present.The survey concluded by pointing out that, though a complete and final answer as to our ability to meet the .Belgian demand will not be feasible for some time, theenquiry has already gone far enough to make it necessary to
obtain an instruction on a matter of policy9  viz. ..  whether war supplies to Belgium are to be placed on an equal,  or in some important cases even a higher,  degree of priority with United Kingdom supplies and whether,  accordingly,  the peace plans for providing the latter supplies are to be extended so as to cover the former, where these could not be met in advance by one or other of the medthods above stated..    It added that a decision on the point of policy was requisite before any statement can usefully be made  to the Belgians,,Future Action.4. I thought it well at this stage to ascertain theviews of the Foreign Secretary, particularly as to the point of policy.    He advises me that, while from the political point of view,  it is still very desirable to do nothing to discourage the Belgians from seeking to collaborate with us in matters of this nature,  the danger of Belgium drifting further towards isolationism has somewhat receded since last March,  particularly perhaps as a result of the Anglo-French Declaration of  84th April and the German Declaration of 13th October, by which Belgium has to a large extent achieved her immediate ends in so far as her international position is concerned.    He therefore sees no reason to give Belgian requirements priority over our own, but thinks that we should do our best to help in those cases where there is no conflict of interest,  or where there is no domestic objection to increasing our production,  so that the Belgian needs can be met at the same time as our own (if necessary, after inducing the Belgians to adopt British patterns of equipment),,There is a further aspect of this question to which I must refer.    In the endeavour to provide capacity for meeting our own probable requirements in war, we are incurring considerable capital expenditure in peace as e0g0.
on factory construction for explosives and propellants, onthe &quot;shadow&quot; factories for airframes and aero engines oron equipment of engineering firms for shell or shallcomponents or other forms of armament production.      I take it that no such expenditure can he incurred by us in an endeavour to supply Belgian war requirements as well as ourown war requirements, and this must be made clear to the belgians in any statement to them on the subject.,I have given full consideration to the whole matter in the light of all the information I have received and to which I have referred above,  and I submit thefollowing Conclusions for the approval of my colleagues(i)    That it is desirable, both from the point of view of the Belgian Government and .of our own supply position, to put the question of the supply of the Belgian requirements on a more definite basis.(ii)    That to this end,  the Belgians should now be frankly informed of the extent to which it is considered possible for us to meet their demando(iii)    That, in cases where it is found to beimpossible to do this, and where there is also risk of their competing in the same market as ourselves for supplies (e^go Foodstuffs)  to the detriment of us both, the Belgian Government should be encouraged to come to some agreement with us regarding such purchases.(iv)    That as regards our own Supply Organisation, in view of the complexity and size of the Belgian demands, the responsibility for dealing with these requirements should be decentralised as far as practicable and passed on by the Supply Board to the appropriate departments, the Supply Board continuing to act as necessary for purposes of co-ordination.(v)    That these departments should establish and maintain liaison direct and as close as possible with the appropriate Belgian representatives as regards the items for which each is responsible., Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, 2nd February,  1938.(Initialled)    T.v/0E.I0
