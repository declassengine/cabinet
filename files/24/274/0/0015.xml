162(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) SECRET.CP.15(58). Copy No. (mOCABIN E T. ^RESERVE OF WHALE OIL.Memorandum &quot;by the.Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.1. In July last the Cahinet decided to defer furtherconsideration of proposals submittedby the Committee of Imperial Defence Sub-Committee on Pood Supplies in Time of War for the creation of additional reserves of foodstuffs until their cost had been examined in my Review of Defence Expenditure generally, As my colleagues are aware, I am now engaged upon the second stage of this Review and my report will deal with the question of expenditure upon food storage.2. I am, however, anxious to obtain in advance of adecision on the general question of food storage, authority to arrange for an increase in the stock of whale oil normally held in this country.    Pats is the commodity in which we are most vulnerable.   For more than 90% of our supply we depend upon imports.    In the case of butter,  a large part of our supplies comes from North Eastern Eu.rope, and would probably he cut off in time of war.    Stocks of fats kept in this country are small and normally do not exceed six weeks&apos; supply.3. The most suitable commodity to I supplement thisshortage is whale oil, which is one of the principal ingredients in the manufacture of margarine and other   manufactured fats, such as compound lard, which are used largely by takers. I, therefore, invited Mr. D&apos;Arcy Cooper, the Chairman of Unilevers, to see me in the early part of December, and asked his advice as to the cheapest method of finding a temporary solution to the problem, pending a decision on the 1 general-1-
policy of food storage.    After talking tire matter over, I asked him to prepare an estimate of the cost to Unilever Limited of maintaining in this country for a period of twelve months from the 1st March next the maximum supply of whale oil that could he accommodated in their existing storage tanks, thus ohviating the necessity for any capital expenditure in connection with, this interim proposal.   Mr. D&apos;Arcy Cooper agreed to do this, and the following proposal is based, on a suggestion which I subsequently received from him.4. Unilever Ltd. would maintain at Bromborough (nearLiverpool) from 1st March, 1938, until 28th February,  1939, a minimum reserve of 60,000 tons of whale oil.    To carry out this undertaking the tanks at Bromborough, in accordance with normal practice, would be filled to capacity by the end of the current whaling season,  i.e., end of February. Instead, however, of allowing stocks to decline throughout the year so that by February,  1939, the tanks would contain no more than a small working margin, supplies sufficient to maintain the minimum level of 60,000 tons would &quot;be brought over as required from Rotterdam.    It is estimated that, in order to carry out this scheme, 50,000 tons of oil would have to be transported from Unilever&apos;s stock in Holland to this country, involving additional handling and freightage charges to an amount of  34,800 in the full year.    It is not proposed to make any interest charge on the capital cost of the oil, nor any charge for the accommodation of the whale oil at Bromborough.   No capital outlay will he required for the provision of tankage.5. It is estimated that, allowing for a reduction inthe consumption of edible fats &quot;by 2b% after the outbreak of war, the proposed minimum reserve of 60,000 tons would represent about four weeks&apos;  supply of edible fats.
6. The proposal has been exarained..J^y--che.J?ood (Dejk?ncePlans) Department, and I am advised that as a temporary-proposal to tide us over until our storage policy can he placed on a more permanent basis,  and subject to any minor economies that it may be found possible to effect, ecg0, in freight rates,  the estimated cost of the proposal  ( 34,800) is fair and reasonable.7. I am putting forward this memorandum in advance ofthe Report of my Review on Defence Expenditure generally because it is necessary that,  if action is to be taken along the lines suggested, a decision should be reached and communicated to Unilever Ltd. by, or soon after,  the middle of February.      The sum involved is a comparatively small one.      I am advised that the whale oil harvest is expected to be an unusually good one this year, ana tnat the probability is that the price will oe higher next year and that it would not be then practicaole to put forward such an economical proposition-      Moreover,  the proposal has special advantages in thai  it relieves  the Government of the responsibility of entering the market and buying on its own account and also avoids the need for any capital outlay, I hope that it may be found possible to apply similar methods to some other commodities which should be included within a general storage programme.8. I, therefore, ask for authority to write to Mr. D&apos;ArcyCooper agreeing to Unilevers purchasing an additional 50,000 tons of whale oil, and undertaking that the Government will recoup Unilever in respect of the approved additional expenditure they incur in handling and freightage, not exceeding in all  34,800, provided that they maintain at Bromborough a minimum stock of 60,000 tons throughout the twelve months beginning 1st March next.     My colleagues.
will realise that if the present proposal is approved, it can hardljr &quot;be treated as an isolated case and they will be more or less committed to adopt some further measures for food storage.    I therefore assume that the expenditure involved in this proposal if adopted will be defrayed from the provision to be made in the Board of Trade Estimates for the purposes of food storage generally in accordance with any decision that may be reached by the Cabinet when they have received my Review of Defence Expenditure.(Intld.)
