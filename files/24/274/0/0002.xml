SECRET.CP.   2 (58). COPY NO. tlCCABINET.RABBITS BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland.1.     The approval of our colleagues is desired to the preparation of a Rabbits Bill for introduction into Parliament as soon as an opportunity can be found.      It is suggested that the Bill might conveniently be introduced in the House of Lords.2.     A Select Committee of that Hou.se was appointed in November, 1956, to consider the question of damage to agriculture by rabbits, and in its Report, which was issued in February last, the Committee recommended legislation for the following purposes(a) To empower County Councils, on being satisfied after fair and impartial enquiry that an owner or occupier of land has allowed rabbits so to multiply as to cause injury to adjoining property, to order the destruction of the rabbits or the adoption of such precautions as will prevent their causing damage. Failing compliance with such order, the County Council should be empowered to institute legal proceedings against the offender.(b) To enable County Councils to provide trained men with the necessary tackle who could be employed, on application by the land owner or occupier, for hire .or otherwise, in the destruction of rabbits.
9 A(c) To empower neighbouring owners or occupiers to claim compensation from an offender in respect of damage done by rabbits from his land.(d) To require keepers of warrens,    for the purpose of rabbit farming,  to fence the warrens.(e) To place beyond doubt the legality of the use of gas for destroying rabbits.(f) To prohibit the setting of gin traps in the open. (This is at present permissible for owners of lands but not for occupiers).3.      Representations have already been made in Parliament and elsewhere pressing for the early introduction of a Bill to implement these recommendations, and the necessity for more effective control of rabbits is emphasised by the efforts which are at present being made with the aid of State funds to improve the fertility of our grass land.      It is therefore desired to proceed forthwith with the preparation of a Bill on the general lines recommended by the Select Committee.      Such a Bill would involve no expenditure out of monies provided by Parliament and would not be likely to provoke serious controversy, since it would not only have the advantage of following the report of the. Select Committee of the House of Lords but would also avoid certain features of previous Bills to which opposition was mainly directed..4.-     We might add that the Select Go;.unittee also recommended that the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries should at once make technical enquiries in order to find a less cruel type of trap than those now in use, and that when it was established that such a trap had been found, the use of all other types should be prohibited.      These enquiries are already in progress, but it is undesirable that legislation should await the issue of
January 5th, 1958.this investigation as it is impossible to say whether a completely satisfactory type of trap can be evolved.     Moreover, the proposal to prohibit the use of traps not of an approved type presents considerable difficulty and seems likely to be highly controversial.5.     We suggest that, if the proposal to prepare a Bill is approved, there may be some advantage in introducing it into the House of Lords at a reasonably early date,   notwithstanding the doubt whether, should it pass the Lords, the necessary time can be found for it in the Coi.imons this Session.(Intld.)

Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1938.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 3 (38).CABINET.THE STIFFENING OF MERCHANT SHIPS FOR defensive armament.Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.AVITH reference to Cabinet 36 (37), Conclusion 12, of the 6th October last, I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a Memorandum on the acceptance by shipowners of the Government&apos;s proposals for the stiffening of merchant ships for defensive armament. sDUFF COOPER.January 6, 1938.Memorandum.THE decision reached by the Cabinet on 6th October, 1937, regarding the liability for the cost of incorporating stiffening in merchant vessels to enable them to take a defensive armament, has now. been promulgated to the shipping community at two special meetings held at the Admiralty. At these meetings the owners of both liner and tramp tonnage present unanimously agreed to support the Government proposals and to recommend their general adoption. Meetings of shipowners have also been held at Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff and Hull and at each place the local association passed a unanimous resolution adopting the proposals.The Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom and the Liverpool Steam-ship Owners&apos; Association have since met and passed resolutions accepting the proposals and recommending to their members their general adoption. It can now be stated, therefore, that the co-operation of the shipowners in executing the Government policy is assured. Moreover, the President of the Shipbuilding-Conference has promised the full co-operation of his Association.In accepting the Government&apos;s proposals the shipowners have agreed to incorporate stiffening, at their own expense, in vessels of over 500 tons gross which they may build in the next two or three years. Such stiffening will be carried out under Admiralty supervision and in general will provide for the mounting of two guns in vessels of over 1,600 tons gross and one gun in vessels between 500 and 1,600 tons gross.The negotiations have been conducted in the most cordial atmosphere and the Admiralty have obtained the greatest possible assistance from .the Board of Trade throughout.As a result of these developments, work in regard to stiffening ships offered by their owners is already making good progress, and it is anticipated that this will be accelerated when the Government &quot;proposals become more generally known.With this object in view a memorandum has now been issued by the Admiralty after consultation with the Board of Trade to all shipowners, setting out the proposals and .the details of the procedure which they should adopt to put them into effect.
