TWENTY-FOURTH REPORT.Survey of the economic situation, December 1937.BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical reports on the economic situation; and in accordance with these instructions we now submit the twenty-fourth of these periodical reports. The report represents the general views of the committee, without attempting to express the different shades of opinion held by individual members.2. As we have only recently submitted our twenty-third report, we have on this occasion omitted the summary of economic events which we generally prepare as an introduction to our survey of the economic situation.(Signed on behalf of the committee) :J. C. STAMP, Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, January 4, 1938.[16361]
twenty-fourth report.Survey of the economic situation.THERE have lately been changes for the worse in the economic situation, rapid in the case of the United States, less definite in this country. We discuss below the causes of this change and the outlook for the future first in this country and then in America. We then examine the influence of a recession in America on the United Kingdom and on international trade. Finally, we consider remedial measures.(1) The United Kingdom.2. There are three points where there are signs that demand is falling off in this country; first in the industries producing semi-finished consumption goods, especially the textile trades; secondly, the industries producing long-lived consumption goods, e.g., motor cars and wireless sets, and high-priced consumption goods and services; thirdly, in house building. A substantial reduction in employ-ment has occurred in the first of these groups of industries, and some reduction in the second; employment in building has not yet been affected.3. Industries producing semi-finished goods are greatly affected by changes in the quantity of stocks carried by manufacturers and distributors and in transit. When prices are expected to rise these stocks are increased, and when prices are expected to fall, or when there is a condition of financial stringency, they are diminished. The demand for semi-finished goods may vary by as much as ten per cent, above or below normal for some time without any change in the ultimate demand of consumers. A year ago there was a general expectation that prices would rise and this probably led to an accumulation of stocks. There was in any event a substantial improvement in employment in these industries which continued throughout the summer, although there is normally a seasonal decline in the summer. Since September commodity markets have ruled weak, and the prices of some classes of semi-finished goods are now likely to decline. Business men have an inducement to reduce their stocks below normal. This process is already under way, and the unsatisfactory unemployment returns of the last two months are largely attributable to a decline in employment in these industries, which normally experience a seasonal improvement at this time of year.4. A substantial part of the demand for semi-manufactured goods produced in this country is for export, and demand is affected by variations in stocks abroad as well as at home. The satisfactory export figures this summer may have been caused in part by the process of accumulating stocks abroad, and if there is now a tendency for stocks to be reduced, the export figures of the next few months will suffer.5. Fluctuations in activity induced by variations in stocks may be of a transitory nature. If no secondary effects are produced, and if investment activity in other directions is maintained, the present recession of activity in the textile and other industries of this class, though it may be sharp is not likely to be unduly protracted, and in any event some revival of activity is probable in these industries by the second half of 1938. The danger is that the slight worsening in general demand which must follow from the present increase in unemployment may check the process of investment over a wider field.6. There has also been a falling off in some classes of retail demand. The October figures show a sharp contraction of retail sales in the central London area. Sales of motor cars and wireless sets appear also to have been substantially lower in that month than a year before. In other directions, however, retail trade was well maintained. It seems that there has been a sharp contraction in the expenditure of the well-to-do, but that this has not so far communicated itself to the general public.7. This falling off in demand cannot be a reflection of a reduction of con-sumers&apos; income, for no such reduction has occurred. There are two possible explanations. The first is that demand has been affected by the fall in the value of
stock exchange securities; the second is that the market for a number of the more durable forms of consumers&apos; goods has reached a point of temporary saturation after the heavy purchases made in the last few years of great prosperity. The purchase of motors has probably been seriously affected by the decline in security values. For this is a form of expenditure which is stimulated by rising stock -exchange prices, and contracts when prices fall. In other directions, however, the factor of saturation may play a more important part. For instance, the increase in the number of better-class houses is probably coming to a close, and this has already affected the demand for furniture and other household goods. This effect on demand is likely to become more serious.8. Finally, there is a falling off in private house building. Plans passed for new dwelling houses have been declining since the middle of 1936. But the decline has not yet reached serious proportions. The value of plans passed for dwelling houses is still at the level of the second half of 1933, when the housing boom was well under way. The decline has been caused in part by the increase in building costs and may be retarded if a reduction in demand leads to lower costs in the building industry. We do not anticipate that the number of houses to be built in 1938 will be smaller than in 1937 by more than 60,000, and the difference may be substantially less than this. We anticipate however, a further decline, possibly of the same order, in 1939 and 1940. A growing proportion of the houses built are likely to be of a smaller type.9. A reduction of the order of 60,000 houses in the year would represent an expenditure of  25 to  30 millions. Without special knowledge, we are handi-capped in forecasting whether such a deficiency in capital expenditure is likely to be offset by increasing loan expenditure by the Government in connection with rearmament. Such indications as are available certainly suggest that it will. The net borrowing in respect of the budget so far this year only exceeds that for last year by  26 millions, and indicates a deficit on the year of little more than  40 millions. The prospective deficit may be increased by heavier expenditure in the last quarter. But in the calendar year 1937 expenditure can hardly have been at the rate necessary to fulfil the expectation of an average annual deficit of  80 millions. Provided that industrial investment is maintained, the total expen-diture on armaments and investment goods (buildings, plant and vehicles) in 1938 should be at least as great as in 1937.10. On the other hand, expenditure on building alone is likely to be less in 1938 than 1937. This should allow some reduction in costs, and may therefore tend to support building activity in the latter part of the year. It may also, if demand is maintained in other directions, permit the absorption of some part of the surplus labour in the building industries into other trades.11. The outlook for investment in the years succeeding 1938 is less satis-factory. We anticipate a further contraction in house building, which presumably will not be offset by an increase in loan expenditure for rearmament. When this stage is reached more deep-seated symptoms of economic malaise are likely to appear than are discernible at present.12. To sum up, it appears probable that the worsening of economic conditions in this country is caused by, first, the dispersal of stocks built up throughout the world in the early part of 1937 in anticipation of higher prices, and, secondly, the falling off in the demand for luxury goods on the part of those whose financial position has been impaired by the fall in values on the American and British stock exchanges. Both these factors may prove only to have a transitory influence, if, as appears probable, investment and defence expenditure together are well maintained. In that event there may be an improvement in the position later. Provided that there is no deterioration in the United States great enough to be reflected here, the year as a whole is not likely to be much better or much worse than 1937, though there may be some increase in unemployment. The outlook for the more distant future is less satisfactory, because of the probability of a decline in investment expenditure beginning in 1940, or even 1939.(2) The United States.13. The more severe recession now occurring in the United States resembles that in Great Britain in some respects, particularly in the part played by the accumulation and dissipation of stocks.    The situation, however, has been
complicated by a number of factors not present in this country. Among these must be included changes in Government expenditure, the financial policy of the Federal Reserve Board, and the increase in the rate of wages.14. Variations in the attitude of manufacturers and distributors to the holding of stocks are probably greater in the United States than in this country, and the course of trade recovery has been consequently more uneven. We have examined the ratio between output and sales of consumers&apos; goods in the United States since 1932.* There were in this period two phases of stock reduction. April to August 1932 and January to April 1933. There were also three phases of stock accumulation, June to October 1933, February to July 1934, and November 1936 to August 1937. In 1932 and the first four months of 1933 stocks were probably reduced by the equivalent of approximately a month and a halfs consumption. The two big restocking movements in 1933 and 1934 added to stocks perhaps the equivalent of 70 per cent, and 40 per cent, of a month&apos;s consumption respectively, and the balance lost in the slump was probably made good in the two years from the middle of 1934 to the middle of 1936. The accumulation of stocks from the end of 1936 to August 1937 has possibly added the equivalent of three-quarters of a month&apos;s consumption to stocks.15. Financial conditions were probably responsible for the changes in stocks in the period 1932-34. The destocking movements coincided with the recrudescence of banking failures, and the restocking movements with the relaxation of financial tension. The accumulation of stocks in the early part of 1937 was probably due to a general belief that prices would rise, and was itself responsible for the rise in prices which actually occurred.16. In fact, however, changes had occurred in the budgetary policy of the Administration and in the financial policy of the Federal Reserve Board which had a restrictive effect upon consumers&apos; outlay. In the summer and autumn of 1936 retail trade and the demand for motor cars was stimulated by the payments in respect of the veterans&apos; bonus. But even disregarding this, the net cash deficit of the American Treasury was much lower in the second and third quarters of 1937 than in the same quarters of 1936, though some of the increased receipts of the Treasury were in respect of funds set up under the social security act and are held against liabilities accruing in the future. Taking into account the veterans&apos; bonus and the budget deficit, the monthly cash deficit of the Treasury was possibly $350 millions less in the second and third quarters of 1937 than in the corresponding quarters of 1936. This change in policy is an influence tending to a decline in the expenditure of the consuming public. While incomes were being augmented by the additional wage payments involved in the accumula-tion of stocks consumers&apos; demand was maintained; but when this accumulation began to slacken off in the summer, the volume of retail demand appears to have fallen below that of a year ago.* The attached table gives an index of this ratio in the period 1932-87. The index has many statistical imperfections. In particular the figures for the first two months of every year are probably unduly high. The index is based on series for retail sales, retail prices, employ-ment in &quot;non-durable goods &quot; industries, and the Federal Reserve Board Index of production.Ratio of output to sales of consumers&apos; goods in the United States, 1932-1937.-	1932.	1933.	1934.	1935.	1936.	1937.January	97	92	101	108	108	114February	97	90	106	105	104	115March ...	97	89	107	99	97	110April  ...	86	87	110	100	99	111may   ...	85	99	108	106	99	107June   ...	83	113	108	97	100	105July.........	82	&apos; 123	104	98	99	102August	89	115	&apos;   102	102	105	100September	95	116	92	98	101	October	95	107	101	103	100	November	96	101	.    99	103	104	December	96	98	101	101	106	
17. Demand may also have been affected to some extent by the more restric-tive monetary policy pursued by the Federal Reserve system and the Treasury. In December 1936 the Treasury began the policy of sterilising gold imports, and prevented the automatic increase in the basis of credit which the inflow of European capital to America previously entailed. In March and May the reserves which member banks of the Federal Reserve system were required to hold against a given volume of deposits were increased, so that the possibility of credit expansion afforded by the unutilised reserves due to the previous capital inflow was avoided. In 1936 bank deposits in the United States increased by 10 per cent. Largely as a result of these measures, 1937 as a whole will show a contraction. The Government demand for new finance this year has been much smaller than last year; but the total demand for capital has probably only been slightly smaller because of the greater demand for loans to cover increased working capital, and because private investment has been on a larger scale. The upward movement of security prices which occurred in 1936 came to a close quite early in 1937. Through the spring and summer the demand for capital was adequate to carry off the supply, and the prices of securities did not then receive the stimulus which the extension of credit provided in 1936. The change from a rapidly rising stock market to a stationary market probably affected consumption, and this effect was, of course, accentuated after the serious break in the market in September.18. American wage rates rose very considerably in the first part of 1937, and this rise is probably an important factor in the present situation. The rise amounted to about 15 per cent, in factory trades and was granted before the prices of goods produced showed a comparable rise. The willingness of employers to grant wage increases was probably due to their confidence that they would be able to pass on increased charges to consumers and to fears of the increasing strength of the trades unions. The expectation that the cost of wage increases could be passed on has proved unfounded, and real wages have risen by approximately 8 per cent. An increase of real wages of this order must have an appreciable effect on the profit-earning capacity of industry. The effect of this on employment is double-edged. The immediate effect of the increase in wages was probably to increase expenditure on consumption; but the smaller profits to be earned in industry may lead to a smaller expenditure on investment. Instances of the effect of higher wages on investment demand are, first, the immediate falling off in constructional contracts awarded after the rise in building costs this summer, and, secondly, the reduced expenditure of the railways on renewals since the granting of increased wages to their operative staff. In any event, demand cannot be maintained unless there is an expansion of investment expenditure to replace the demand previously arising from government borrowing and the increase in working capital. For the time being the relatively high level of wages prevents this.19. The process of reducing working capital must exercise such a depressing-effect on the American situation that no improvement is possible while it lasts. But it is reported to be proceeding rapidly. When it is complete, say by next April, or perhaps earlier, further progress will depend on the equilibrium established between the demand for and supply of capital. If equilibrium is reached at a level not much below last summer&apos;s, without a reduction in the level of real wages recently established, a further period of good trade should follow. Capital was required last summer to increase stocks, and demand for this purpose will not recur. There must, therefore, be an increased demand from other quarters if recovery is to continue. Failing a return to the principle of budget deficits the most likely source of increased demand is for investment in the fixed assets of industry and in houses. Attention in the United States is focussed on the possibility of expansion in capital expenditure by the public utility companies, the railways, and on private house building.20. One condition of an improvement in investment expenditure is that there should be a cheapening of the terms on which capital is made available to industry. This is required to offset the increase in real wages. The reduction in the demand for bank loans to finance the holding of stocks, and the reduced demands of the Government for finance, are factors which may assist this result. There is already a slight improvement in the price of Government securities, and this should continue and extend to other securities.   It could be reinforced by a
more expansive policy on the part of the Federal Reserve system. The American Government has already released a substantial amount of sterilised gold. But this step has not yet checked the fall in prices induced by the deflationary measures taken a year ago to prevent an excessive rise. A revival of confidence apparently requires the adoption of more settled policies, and the avoidance of shocks to business sentiment.21. The output of the investment industries was very seriously curtailed in the depression. It is doubtful whether at any time in the years 1931-1935 this output was great enough to replace the fixed capital which wore out or became obsolete. In 1936 and 1937 some of the more urgent demands for overdue replacement were probably met. But over a large field a great deal still remains to be done. This is especially true of the telephone and electric supply companies. In the twenties these industries were absorbing perhaps 1,000 million dollars of capital yearly. Since 1931 they have absorbed no capital at all. Now demand has recovered to a point at which new investment is urgently needed. It has been held back hitherto by the long standing quarrel between the President and the companies, but both sides have a strong inducement to reach an accommodation. If they succeed a big stimulus should be given to the investment industries, especially if the utility companies revert to the practice, abandoned in the depression, of providing in advance the plant required to meet the anticipated expansion of demand over the next two or three years.22. The position of the railways is more difficult. They have granted wage increases which make it impossible to earn profits at the present level of freight charges. If they receive permission to increase charges, there will be some diversion of traffic to the roads, and this will diminish the need for renewal expenditure. If they do not receive permission to increase charges they will not be in a financial position to undertake the necessary renewals unless wages are again reduced. The prospects of an increase in house building are more favourable, though here again the question of wages is important. The administration intends to extend the provision of the acts under which finance is made available to mortgage societies, both by increasing the proportion of the value of houses on which mortgages may be made, and by bringing a number of important categories of houses, previously excluded, within the scope of the acts. Moreover, the falling off in the demand for bank loans to carry stocks should make bank loans more readily available to finance building. It is possible, however, that a reduction of building wages will have to occur before there is any revival of building activity.23. In spite of the difficulties noticed above, the prospects for an increase in private investment expenditure in the United States are fair. We should anticipate an increase in activity in the investment industries in the second part of 1938. In that event recovery should be resumed in the United States on a firmer basis. On this favourable assumption the year 1939 should be a good year for American trade. The arrears of investment expenditure will, however, be exhausted comparatively quickly, and we should not expect the American improvement to withstand the influence of worsening world conditions if there should be a turn for the worse in other countries in 1940 or thereabouts.24. It may happen, however, that investment expenditure will not revive&apos; in the United States. In that event, though there would presumably be some improvement in activity at the close of the period of destocking, there would not be any strong resumption of American recovery in the latter part of the year 1938, and the prospects for the year 1939 would be doubtful. As trade may show signs of recession in the United Kingdom and a number of other countries in that year, the absence of support from good trade in the United States might prove of decisive influence on world economic conditions in that year.(3) The connection between trade activity in the United States and theUnited -Kingdom.25. Conditions in the United States react upon those in the United Kingdom through the interdependence of financial markets, and through inter-national trade. The most direct effect of the present recession has been the loss which it has caused to those British investors who had capital invested on Wall
Street. This loss has no doubt contributed to the decline in the retail purchases of the well-to-do and the purchase of motor cars noticed above. A revival of American security prices would assist demand from these quarters in the United Kingdom.26. Secondly, the falling off of trade activity in the United States leads at once to a curtailment of imports. As the direct exports from this country to the United States play a comparatively small part in the balance of payments between them, the effect of this curtailment of demand is largely indirect, working-through the reduced demand for British exports from countries which sell raw materials to the United States, and whose purchasing power will be affected by reduced sales to the United States. In so far as the depression in America reduces American prices, American competition will also be accentuated in British markets at home and abroad and this may affect employment, though it will be accompanied by an increase in British purchasing power due to lower costs of non-competitive American exports.27. As American foreign trade, taking imports and exports together, consists largely of the purchase and sale of raw materials, of which this country is an importer, the effect of depression in America is to reduce the prices of British imports more than the prices of British exports. This is to say it leads to an improvement in the terms on which British overseas trade is carried on with countries other than the United States. An improvement in the British terms of trade leads to an improvement in the British standard of life (cf. the improve-ment in the purchasing power of wages in Great Britain in the depression), but it may or may not lead to a reduction in the demand for labour. Which will occur depends on the degree to which British exports are curtailed by their increase in price relative to imports on the one hands, and, on the other hand, the extent to which domestic trade in Great Britain is stimulated by the release of purchasing power prevously directed to the purchase of imports, and now free for expenditure on domestic produce. In the immediate future, the adverse effect on British exports of a relative reduction in the price of imports is likely to be moderate; for there has previously been a sharp rise in the price of imports, and primary producing countries have tended to accumulate part of the funds accruing to them through this rise in prices in the form of sterling balances, rather than expend them on British goods. The secondary effect that depression in America exercises on the British terms of trade is to be distinguished from the direct effect due to the curtailment of American demand. The latter is bound to affect trade and employment in this country adversely.28. The American depression of 1930-34 had greater effects on the volume of world trade than were attributable to the processes outlined above. This was due to the combination of an unsound extension of overseas lending and acute financial stringency in America caused by the depression. There is no reason to fear that the American banking structure will collapse again as it did in 1931; and even if it does the effects on the rest of the world would be less disastrous, first because the short term indebtedness of the rest of the world to America is much smaller than in 1930, and secondly, because the increased value of the world&apos;s gold pro-duction allows a large drain of capital to America to take place without diminishing the liquid resources possessed by other countries. Against this must be set the fact that European investors are even more interested in the American stock market than was the case in 1929.29. The events of the last seven years have lessened the influence of America on world conditions, by reducing the dependence of Europe and South America on American capital, by reducing the importance of international compared with internal trade, and by insulating a large part of international trade from the influence of world conditions through the development of clearing agreements and the like. This reduction in the influence of the United States applies as strongly to the favourable effect of good American trade as to the unfavourable effect of bad American trade. But the United States is such an important consumer of raw materials that the course of trade activity in that country is bound to have important repercussions in the rest of the world. Moreover, a depression in America which reaches the point at which there is grave financial confusion is more likely to spread to the rest of the world than is any corresponding increase in prosperity.[16361] C
(4) Remedial measures.30. The conclusions of the preceding discussion are that (1) the year 1938 is likely to be affected by the present trade recession in this country, but provided the deterioration in the United States does not proceed so far as to have serious reper-cussions here, the year as a whole should not be substantially woi*se than 1937, though there may be some increase in unemployment; (2) conditions, however, seem likely to show a progressive deterioration in 1939 and 1940, due to the falling off of investment expenditure on house building; (3) 1939 may be a year of good trade in the United States if investment activity gets under way, and this may check the depression in this country.31. Among the principal means which the Government may employ to mitigate or counteract a threatened diminution of industrial activity are : the stimulation of export trade and of investment overseas; the extension of public capital expenditure at home, by the Government itself, by local authorities and by public utility societies; and, finally, credit policy.32. Progress in the field of export trade and investment overseas does not depend entirely on this country; but we think that every effort should be made to promote our export trade by the relaxation of trade barriers, and that the export of capital should not be restricted if and when opportunities for invest-ment are found to appeal to the capital market. In addition the question might be considered whether some expansion might be justified in the scope of business for which the Export Credits Guarantee Department can provide cover. We have dealt in previous reports with the importance of developing our export trade, which is indeed obvious, and we need not refer to the matter further here,&apos; except to say that any slackening in home demand (e.g., in the engineering industries) should help us to compete more effectively in meeting the demand for such products from, overseas. Every effort will have to be made to secure that full advantage is taken of such opportunities, and in the meantime any firms which have allowed their connexions abroad to suffer during the period of strong-home demand should be encouraged now to revive them.33. Public works expenditure is not easily adjusted to a changing situation, as a number of preparatory steps must be taken a long time in advance of actual expenditure. We recognise also that a large proportion of public works must be undertaken at a time which cannot be varied from considerations of its illation to trade activity. Nevertheless, we believe that, on the one condition that preparatory steps are taken forthwith, the Government should be able to prepare a programme in such a manner that a start can be made on it without delay as soon as it is reasonably certain that demand in the investment industries is falling off. This moment can be expected to arrive not long after the factory building phase of rearmament expenditure has reached its peak, as from that time forward the total of Government and private expenditure will be under the influence of the contracting demand for private dwelling houses. It would be wise to prepare for an increase in public works expenditure which could be put into operation at least as early as the second half of 1939, if required. This implies the immediate consideration of the necessary plans. Moreover, as investment expenditure on account of armaments, house building and industry is likely to continue to fall off after that date, the peak of public works expenditure should be timed to occur some time after this point. The essential point is that a few great industries such as building and engineering construction have been expanded owing to exceptional circumstances to a degree which the country&apos;s requirements in ordinary times (and a fortiori in any time of sharp depression) would not altogether justify. If, as is to be feared, the inevitable demobilisation of these industries were to come about abruptly, as occurred after the war, they would be gravely unsettled for many years ahead and the repercussions of this state of affairs on the general industrial prosperity of the country might be very serious. Hence the necessity in our view of the timely preparation of plans for providing such additional work as &quot;is practicable for these industries when the need arises. If our judgment as to the course of events is correct, the timely preparation of plans involves an immediate start.34. We do not suppose that it wilfbe possible or even desirable to construct a programme of public works which will off-set fully the decline in capital investment in all directions, for this decline may occur not only in housebuilding, and defence expenditure of the type involving capital construction, but also&apos; in
ordinary industry. In that event, while it is impossible to be dogmatic on the subject, industry may possibly require the stimulus of some increase in credit, and for this a basis has been laid in the solid improvement in the exchange resources of the country in recent years. Provided that business confidence is not disturbed, an increase of credit tends to check the decline of private investment expenditure and to maintain the outlay on consumption of those persons whose spending is apt to be influenced by the level of security prices. A decline of expenditure on investment does not, of course, remain an isolated phenomenon affecting only the industries concerned with construction. Its effects soon spread to expenditure on consumption goods also, and the decline in the expenditure on consumption goods still further diminishes the attractiveness of new construction projects. To avoid this vicious circle it may be necessary to take vigorous steps to maintain general activity when it appears that investment as a whole is tending to decline seriously.35. The expansion of credit we contemplate might have to be on a fairly considerable scale. There are, however, two limitations which require to be noticed. In the first place, and this is a consideration which applies also to public borrowing in general, it is essential that public confidence in our financial stability should not be disturbed. In the second place, credit expansion beyond a certain degree may be by no means helpful to the increase of our export trade to which we have referred above. Measures which tend to the maintenance of or an increase in the level of prices in this country must have some tendency to check exports and to increase imports except in so far as they are part of wider plans or simultaneous developments influencing the supply of credit in other important countries, particularly the United States.36. The time for an expansion of credit of the nature indicated will not arise until there can be no reasonable doubt that there is a real set-back in trade and industry. But a small increase in credit may be desirable at the present time to prevent the unfavourable conditions in certain quarters setting up a vicious spiral of contraction in industries not so far directly affected. Such an increase in credit might require to be withdrawn later.37. One matter which touches at several points on our recommendations above is that of the building up of stocks of food in this country. It is not for us to express an opinion whether this policy is necessary or desirable on strategical grounds. On the assumption, however, that it is adopted by the Government, we should wish to add the following remarks. As was clearly shown in the depression of 1930-33, there is no single factor which has a more adverse influence on business conditions in this country than a sharp contraction of buying power in the primary producing countries, which are among our best customers, resulting from an abnormally low level of wholesale prices. Any steep fall in wholesale prices of primary commodities below the reduced level they have now reached would in this respect be injurious to us and to the rest of the world. It is true that the reduction has been more marked in the case of raw materials than in food stuffs. The purchase of foodstuffs when prices are weak and threaten to fall further is a double benefit to us, first, because the original stocks of foodstuffs to be stored against an emergency are bought reasonably cheaply, and, secondly, because some-thing would be done to benefit the position of our suppliers at a time when it is badly needed. We cannot say whether such conditions will occur in the course of 1938. But in our submission a very considerable risk would be taken, assuming always, of course, that the purchases are to be made at all, if plans are not pushed forward now to the stage where they are capable of immediate practical applica-tion at extremely short notice when conditions are suitable.38. Apart from the provision of commodities as war reserves, there is the further question referred to in a recent report of the Raw Materials Committee, whether the practice of holding buffer stocks could be organised in the case of certain commodities such as rubber and tin in such a way as to support the market should prices fall to unremunerative levels, and to check excessive price rises in the event of shortage. This proposal raises difficult technical questions both as regards the financial arrangements and the effect of such schemes on market sentiment.  It is, however, worthy of further study.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, January 4, 1938.
