Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1938.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 12 (38).CABINET.PROPOSED APPOINTMENT OF IRISH MINISTER IN ROME.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.WITH reference to CP. 318 (37), I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a note of a conversation which Mr. Eden and I had with Mr. de Valera on the 18th January. I have not yet heard anything definite from Mr. de Valera, but I gather from Mr. Dulanty that an endeavour is being made to extend Mr. MacWhite&apos;s leave for three weeks from the end of January.There have, of course, been other developments since the conversation reported below took place, and in view of the most recent developments regarding our possible conversations with Italy, a three weeks&apos; delay is not of much help. I am considering the matter further, but am doubtful whether we can do anything (even if it is desirable) to persuade Mr. de Valera to postpone to a still later date Mr. MacWhite&apos;s departure for Rome.M. M.January 25, 1938.Mr. Eden and I had an informal conversation with Mr. de Valera (who was accompanied by Mr. Dulanty) this afternoon, concerning the appointment of the Irish Minister to Rome. I explained that we recognised that advice to His Majesty concerning the appointment of a Diplomatic Representative of Eire to a foreign capital was a matter entirely for the Government of Eire. We would not seek to interfere in such a matter. But this case also involved questions of foreign policy which were of common concern to our two countries, and on that ground we were anxious to discuss the matter with him. It was true that he had declared publicly in the Dail that the use of the phrase &quot; King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia &quot; did not in his Governments view involve de jure recogni-tion of the Italian conquest of Ethiopia, and that all that was intended was de facto recognition of the King of Italy&apos;s new title. But we had always been advised that the use of the title would involve de jure recognition. Moreover, it was clear that Mussolini himself shared our view, and that he would do his best to convince the world that Eire had given de jure recognition to the new Italian Empire. The situation was embarrassing to us and very gratifying to Mussolini. I would venture to make a purely personal suggestion, i.e., that when Mr. Mac White (the Minister Designate in Rome) returned from his present post in Washington he should be given some weeks&apos; leave before proceeding to Rome. Such a period of leave would not be inappropriate in the case of a Minister changing posts; and would not necessarily arouse any comment. This would give our two Governments more time to consider the situation, and possibly before the few weeks had passed, we ourselves would be ready to take a step which involved our use of the title &quot; King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia.&quot;Mr. de Valera explained that he had not anticipated that his action would cause any public discussion. He was under the impression that we had already gone further than he intended to go regarding de facto recognition of the Italian[16553]
conquest; for instance, we had a Consul-General in Abyssinia. He had been advised that the use of the new title did not involve de jure recognition, and had made it plain in the Dail that the new move did not mean that Eire was according this recognition.Mr. Eden emphasised that Mussolini himself took a different view. Moreover, this view was also held by other countries. The use of the title &quot; Emperor of Abyssinia &apos;&apos; had become a sort of symbol of de jure recognition, and because they refused to use the title in the Credentials of their Diplomatic Representatives at Rome, a number of countries were actually unrepresented there to-day. This was true o&apos;f France, Holland, Sweden, Finland and some other countries.Mr. de Valera seemed surprised at this information. He said that he knew that France had taken up this attitude, but was not aware of the similar position of other countries. As regards France, she had adopted this attitude after Mr. de Valera himself had agreed with the Italian Government to the new arrangement. He was extremely sorry if any action of his Government appeared helpful to Mussolini in his conquest of Ethiopia, for that was the very last thing that he intended. However, he thought that he had already given an undertaking to Rome that the new Minister would arrive and present his Credentials on a definite date, either at the end of January or early in February. He would look into the matter and see whether the Ministers arrival could be postponed. If it could be postponed without any breach of faith on his part, he would gladly arrange somehow for his departure from Dublin to be delayed for a few weeks. But he was afraid that it had been agreed.Mr. Eden asked whether it would be possible to postpone the matter at least until after the meeting of the League Council next week. He thought it possible that the League Council would take some action which would ease the situation, though on the whole he thought this unlikely.Mr. de Valera said that if the agreement with the Italian Government permitted this, he would certainly see that his Minister did not proceed to Rome until after the Council meeting.There was some further discussion as to the state of affairs in Abyssinia. Mr. de Valera seemed genuinely to regret the difficulty which his action was causing, and obviously particularly disliked doing anything which would enable Mussolini to claim a minor triumph. But it appears extremely doubtful whether Mr. de Valera will actually be able to postpone the Minister Designated departure for his new post.M. M.January 18, 1938.
