Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1938.SECRET. CP 25 (38).CABINET.NAVAL RATINGS:   MARRIAGE ALLOWANCE AND PAY.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.Marriage Allowance.THE proposal made by the Secretary of State for War in his Memo-randum OP. 22 (38) necessitates my putting forward simultaneously certain proposals regarding the emoluments of naval ratings.2. At present, the Navy, unlike the other two Services, has none of the benefits of the married quarters roll, and the provision made for the families of naval ratings is confined to marriage allowance for a wife of 7s. or 10s., according to the scale of pay, with additions for each child. This wide disparity in the treatment of married naval ratings in comparison with married soldiers and airmen has been causing the Admiralty increasing anxiety and embarrass-ment in recent years. This embarrassment would necessarily be increased if the proposals of the Secretary of State for War to improve the pay of soldiers resulted in a parity of. pay between the two Services while the present grave disparity in married benefits persists.3. In inter-departmental discussion, the Air Ministry have put forward proposals under which all married soldiers and airmen at the age of 26 shall receive an allowance of 17s. a week for a wife, with additions, as at present, for each child.4. It is very necessary that the Air Ministry scheme, which has now been adopted by the Secretary of State for War, should be extended to the Navy, and that all married men in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines over the age of 25 should receive an allowance of 17s. for a wife, with additions for children. The Navy will still be at a disadvantage in married benefits, in that free medical attendance, transport and other benefits of the married quarters roll will not be available to married naval ratings.5.   The cost of this proposal for 1938 is  732,000. Pay. ,6. The proposals made by the Secretary of State for War to increase the pay of soldiers, particularly in the lower ranks, to the level of the rates for Continuous Service ratings of the Navy necessitate an increase in the pay of naval ratings on Special Service engagements to the same level.7. Naval ratings entered on Special Service Engagements (seven years&apos; service in the Fleet and five in the Reserve) receive rates of pay which for Able Seamen and Leading rates are lower by Qd. than the rates of pay for men entered[16684]copy No.

This difference in pay according to length of engage-ment is not justified, and now that a substantial portion of the naval personnel is on Special Service engagements, I should in any case have proposed that.the tates of pay for Continuous Service and Special Service should be equalised..8. The cost of this proposal for 1938 is  45,000. The ultimate cost is dependent on the ultimate number of men to be entered on Special Service engagements, and is at present estimated at  104,000.D.
