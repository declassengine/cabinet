/ *SECRET. COPY NO.        4 3CP. 3  (33).G A 3 I IT E T. SUPPLY OF ARMS TO THE FAR EAST. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.My colleagues will recall that on the 17th November, 1937 ^/Cabinet 42 (37),  Conclusion 3(bJ,7 it was decided :-&quot;that applications by private firms for &quot;licences for export of war material to &quot;China and Japan should he dealt with as &quot;hitherto&quot;;in other words that a policy of &quot;masterly inactivity&quot; should &quot;be maintained as long as possible in regard to Japan.When this decision was taken, three applications were outstanding for licences to export v/ar material to Japan.      One of these  (from Messrs. VickersArmstrongs Limited, for 400,000 rounds of .5&quot;ammunition) has now been rejected, on the ground thatthe supply of the material concerned would retard theexecution of orders placed by the Service Departments;and no subsequent application in respect of arms for japan has so far &quot;been submitted.      There remainoutstanding, however  :-(l) an application (from Messrs. Alvis-StrausslerLimited) in respect of one light tank and one armoured car, valued at  19,225;    and(2) an application (from the Soley Armament Company)in respect of 130 Lewis guns (air type) withspare parts;The tank and armoured car are not of Service pattern, and are now understood to-1-
r&apos;be ready for delivery:    the applicants are-pressing for a licence to be issued, and calling for an explanation of the exceptional delay.    The Lewis guns are understood to have originally been surplus material sold by the Air Ministry to the Soley Armament Company (before the present hostilities in China broke out).    In both cases,  therefore, there are no military grounds on which the applications for export licences could be rejected; and equally it is not practicable to withhold licences on commercial grounds.    The alternatives are, therefore, either to grant the two licences, or else to admit - explicitly or tacitly -float licences for the export of war material to Japan are being indefinitely withheld by His Majesty&apos;s Government for political reasons.    I am advised that this latter course would be contrary to Article 9 of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 3rd April 1911, which provides :-Nor shall any prohibition or restriction be imposed on the exportation of any article from the territories of either of the two High Contracting parties to the territories of the other which shall not equally extend to the exportation of the like article to any other foreign country&quot;. I need not stress the grave commercial objections to taking action contrary to the Treaty.In these circumstances I am forced to the conclucJ.cn that we can no longer delay the issue of licences on these two outstanding applications, and I propose to proceed accordingly.O.P.G.S. &apos;Board of Trade,January 21st, 1938.
