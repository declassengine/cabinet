SECRET.CP. 433 (23). i CABINET.FUTURE OF PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE last time that I brought the question of Palestine to the notice of my colleagues was, as they may remember, on the 31st July, 1923, when the Cabinet had before it the Report of the Palestine Committee, over which I presided (CP. 351 (23)).I now circulate papers showing the action taken to give effect to the decision arrived at by the1 Cabinet on that occasion. Stated briefly, the position is that the Palestinian Arabs have rejected the offer made to them by the British Government, and maintain the attitude of non-co-operation, from which it was hoped to move them. In the circumstances, I feel strongly that we cannot proceed. further upon the path of political concession. We have made the Arabs what we regard as a very generous offer. They have rejected it. There can be little doubt that their action has been influenced by encouragement received from this end. They believe,, and they have been encouraged to believe, that if only they hold out they can get much better terms from us. It remains to show them that they are wrong; that we are not to be deflected from our purpose; and that we are determined, with or without their co-operation, to discharge our mandatory obligations in Palestine. Now that the Mandate has. actually come into operation as from the 29th September last, it is more than ever necessary that our intentions should be placed beyond all doubt. I accordingly propose, if my colleagues agree, to address the High Commissioner in the terms of the draft telegram forming the last of the papers appended to this note.I propose to publish the relevant documents in the form of a White Paper before Parliament reassembles.I also propose, after the instructions to Sir H. Samuel have been issued, to circulate the papers for the information of the Imperial Conference, to whom I have already made an oral statement on the subject of Palestine.(Signed)        DEVONSHIRE.October 27, 1923.List of Documents appended to Foregoing Note.1.

Despatch from Secretary of State for the Colonies to High Commissioner Palestine, No. 1223, October 4, 1923.Sir,AS you are aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently had under their consideration the question of the general principles of policy which should guide them, and yourself; as their representative, in discharging the obligations which they have accepted with regard ,to Palestine. The whole matter was most carefully examined by the Committee of the Cabinet before which you appeared in July last. The recommendations of the Committee have since been submitted to and considered by the Cabinet as a whole, and I am now in a position to communicate to you for your information and guidance the conclusions at which His, Majesty&apos;s Government have arrived. ,.2. The key-note of British policy in Palestine, as conducted since the establishment of a civil administration at Jerusalem, is to be found in the Balfour Declaration of November 1917, the terms of which were as follows : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government view with favour the establishment in &quot; Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people, and will use their best &quot; endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly &quot; understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and &quot; religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the &quot; rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&quot;The policy of the declaration was accepted by the principal Allied Powers at the San I^emo Conference in April 1920; its text was embodied verbatim in the treaty signed at Sevres in August 1920, and again in the mandate approved by the Council of the League of Nations in July 1922. It formed an essential part of the conditions on which Great Britain accepted the mandate for Palestine, and thus constitutes an international obligation from which there can be no question of receding.3. It would serve no purpose to review at length the controversy that has raged round the declaration and the policy based upon it. The policy has been attacked on the ground not only that it is unfair to the great majority of the people of Palestine, but also that it conflicts with specific promises made to the Sherif of Mecca during the war. These points were fully dealt with in the state-ment published by the late Government in the White Paper (Cmd. 1700) of June 1922. The general conclusions embodied in that statement are accepted by His Majesty&apos;s present advisers.4. The declaration, as has been frequently pointed out, involved a two-fold obligation to the Jewish people, on the one hand, and to the Arab population . of Palestine on the other. It has been the constant endeavour of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and of yourself as High Commissioner, so to conduct the adminis-tration of Palestine as to do equal justice to the interests of both the parties concerned. The task has been one of great. difficulty, but it has been carried out steadily and with no small measure of success. Nevertheless, the present situation cannot be regarded as satisfactory. The Arabs, or at least the most vocal section of them, maintain an attitude of opposition. The failure of the elections for the Legislative Council, the difficulties encountered in forming an Advisory Council under the Order in Council of 1923, mark the lengths to which opposition has been carried. The underlying causes of Arab discontent are not so easily stated. It appears to be inspired less by dissatisfaction with the present than by fears for the future. Hostility is aroused not so much by the policy as actually enunciated and carried out by the British Government as by the apprehension that, whatever may be the objects of this policy, its ultimate result will be the establishment of Jewish political ascendancy. This apprehension may be ill-founded, but it is none the less widely entertained. The late Government, in the statement already : quoted, endeavoured to place matters in a trueij perspective. But Arab opposition . was not disarmed. It was hoped that the proposed Legislative Council, on which . the Arab community would have been represented by members of its own choice, would go far to satisfy the demand for a greater share in the Government of the country and to remove feelings of inequality or of unfair treatment. Unfortunately, owing to the failure of the majority of the Arabs to participate in the elections,
the Legislative Council has never been brought into being. It remains to consider whether some alternative means cannot be found of meeting what is reasonable in. the Arab demands and of removing anything that may be regarded as legitimate in their grievances.5. A perusal of the numerous representations made by or on behalf of the Arab community shows that the special position accorded to a Jewish agency under article IV of the Palestine Mandate is a general object of complaint. The agency is vested for the present in the Zionist organisation. It was made clear in the &quot;White Paper of last year that the privileges enjoyed by the agency do not entitle it to share in any degree in the government of the country; and this position was officially accepted by the Zionist organisation at the time. I have no reason to doubt that their acceptance was sincere and ungrudging; nor, so far as I am aware, has the organisation made any attempt during the past year to exceed the functions prescribed for it by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It may be contended, on the other hand, that, even though formally excluded from all share in the administration, the Jewish agency does, in fact, by reason of its official recognition and right of access to the High Commissioner, enjoy, and thereby confer upon the Palestine Jews as a whole, a preferential position as compared with the other inhabitants of the country. To that extent it is possible to argue that existing arrangements fall short of securing complete equality between the different communities. His Majesty&apos;s Government can find no evidence that any tangible hardship has in practice arisen ; but it seems clear that the supposed preferential treatment has engendered a feeling of resentment. It is to the problem of removing this feeling, so far as it may be possible to do so, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have thought it their duty to address themselves.6. The withdrawal at this stage of privileges formally accorded by the Mandate to the Jewish agency, and actually enjoyed for some years past, would be impracticable, even if it were desirable in itself. The alternative is to accord similar privileges to an Arab agency. It is the latter course that has commended itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government. They believe that by this means they will place beyond all possibility of question their desire and intention to deal with absolute impartiality between the different communities of Palestine, and to fulfil to the letter the obligations both to Arab and Jew to whioh their predecessors publicly committed themselves. , . ...7. His Majesty&apos;s Government are accordingly prepared to favour the establish-ment of an Arab agency in Palestine, which will occupy a position exactly analogous to that accorded to the Jewish agency under article 4 of the Mandate, i.c, it will be recognised as a public body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the administration in such economic, social and other matters as may affect the interests of the non-Jewish population, and, subject to the control of the administration, of assisting and taking part in the development of the country. As regards immigration (article 6 of the Mandate) the Arab agency will have the right to be consulted as to the means ,of &quot; ensuring that the &quot; rights and position of other (i.e., non-Jewish) sections of the population are not &quot; prejudiced.&quot; With regard to public works, it will be entitled to be consulted by the Administration in the same way as the Jewish agency is to be consulted under the terms of article XI of the Mandate.8. The question of immigration is of primary importance. On the one hand, if a National Home for the Jewish people is to be established in Palestine, there must be treasonable facilities for the admission of Jewish settlers; on the other, the proper regulation of immigration, and its strict correlation to the economic capacity of the country to absorb new inhabitants, are matters of vital concern to the people of Palestine as a whole. The late Government recognised that the matter was one on which the views of the Arab community were entitled to special consideration. They accordingly proposed that the High Commissioner should be required to confer on all matters relating to immigration with a standing committee of elected members of the Legislative Council (the majority of whom would be Arabs); and that in the event of any difference of opinion the question at issue should be referred for decision to the Secretary of State. A provision to this effect was formally embodied in article 84 of the Palestine Order in Council of 1922. No Legislative Council having been elected, the proposed committee has never come into existence. It is proposed that the Arab agency now in contemplation should, in conjunction with the Jewish agency, take its place for the purposes of the functions indicated in article 84 of the Order. [10787] b 2
9. With regard to the composition of the Arab agency, it will be left to the discretion of the High Commissioner to nominate suitable persons in consultation with the local leaders. Representatives of all sections of the Arab community, Christian as well as Mahommedan, should be included.10. There is one point, however, which His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to make quite clear. They regard it as an essential condition that the above arrangements should be introduced only as an agreed settlement to which both parties are prepared to adhere. It is imperative that an end should be placed to the agitation, whether in Palestine or outside, which has been the fruitful source of so much trouble, expense and even bloodshed in the past. The proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government entail a great concession to Arab sentiment. It is a concession which they would not be prepared to make, and which would be made to no purpose, if the new arrangements are not to be loyally implemented by the Arabs themselves.11. You are authorised to take such steps as seem to you desirable to approach the representatives of the Arabs in Palestine and to invite their accept-ance of the policy outlined above. With regard to the Zionists, whose concurrence will also have to be sought, the most convenient course seems to be that I should place myself in communication with the headquarters of the Zionist Organisation in London. I propose to proceed accordingly. The new arrangements, which will be brought into immediate operation, if and when the assent of the two parties has been obtained, will be in the nature of a provisional settlement only, and will be subject to review at such time as a fully representative Legislative Council shall have come into existence in Palestine.12. In the foregoing paragraphs I have dealt with the question as affecting the political situation in Palestine itself. &apos; It must not be inferred that His Majesty&apos;s Government are indifferent to the other aspect of the question, viz., the military and financial commitments which Great Britain has incurred by its acceptance of the Mandate for Palestine. On the contrary, they attach the utmost importance to this branch of the subject. The actual cost of Palestine to the British Exchequer in 1922-23 was 2,024,000 . The estimate for 1923-24 is 1,500,0001; for the following year (1924-25) His Majesty&apos;s Government are pledged, to reduce the figure to 1,000,0001. The oharge is a decreasing one, but it remains sufficiently heavy to be viewed with serious concern. It is, above all things, essential that its progressive reduction should be steadily maintained. The best hope of securing this result, and thus affording relief to the British taxpayer, lies in the improvement of the economic conditions of Palestine itself. But economic conditions will not improve unless political stability is first secured and general confidence established. For this reason His Majesty&apos;s Government have made it their primary concern to devise measures which will put an end to the present agitation and inaugurate a regime in which all sections of the community will co-operate with the British administration.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient,humble servant, (Signed) DEVONSHIRE.No. 2.1&apos;araphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner of Palestine to the Secretary of State for tho Colonies, dated October 8, 1923.No. 338 of 8th October.   Private and Personal.I AM very doubtful as to acceptance of offer of an Arab Agency. The delegation which returned from London is profoundly convinced that His Majesty&apos;s Government has not said its last word on this question. This conviction is based on the encouragement which they received when in London from about 120 Members of Parliament. Executive Council here has received Report in this sense from delegation, and this idea is being disseminated by the Moslem Christian Association, which maintains that, in spite of any announcements which His Majesty&apos;s Government may make from time to time, the Arab cause is progressing favourably.

My address is reproduced verbatim. The reply of Musa Kazem Pasha on behalf of those present was brief, and the report gives the full substance of liis observations, although they are not recorded verbatim.3. I attach also a detailed list of the Arab gentlemen who were present, accompanied by information regarding their status and position in the country. It will be observed that, as far as possible, representatives of all shades of Arab opinion were invited.I have the honour to be, My Lord Duke, Your Grace&apos;s most obedient,&apos; humble servant, (Signed)        HERBERT SAMUEL,High Commissioner.[10787]: Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated October 11, 1923.No. 344 of 11th October.I COMMUNICATED to a fully representative meeting of Arab notables to-day a statement on.the Arab agency following closely the lines of your despatch of 4th October. After an interval for discussion, they expressed themselves unable to accept the proposal as falling short of the demands of the Arab population. A decision against acceptance had previously been taken by both sections, the general lines of the proposal having been made known. It was stated by the Moslem Christiao Association that their delegation knew as early as 24th July in London that this would be the outcome of the Cabinet&apos;s deliberations. The proposal is too far removed from their programme to render its acceptance possible. The moderates knowing that this would be the attitude taken by them, and that in any case agency could not be established without the others, decided to forestall them by publishing their own non-acceptance. Proceedings to-day were therefore brief and unanimous, but perfectly friendly. Atmosphere is quite calm, and at the moment there is a remarkable absence of political agitation throughout the whole country. The fact of the formation of a moderate party is having an effect in undermining the (previously unchallenged) position of the Moslem Christian Association, and several of the Arab papers are now publishing moderate and sensible articles, whereas press a year ago was violent in its opposition. Should the publication of to-day&apos;s proceedings produce any noticeable change in the situation I will telegraph further.
Enclosure in Despatch No. 1041.On the 11th October at 3 p.m. his Excellency the High Commissioner received the under-mentioned gentlemen at Government House : Haj Amur El Husseini. Musa Kazem Pasha Husseini. Abdel Latif Bey Salah. Haj Said Shawa. Abdullah Eff. Dajani. Assem Bey Said. Ragheb Bey Nashashibi. Sheikh Omar Zousiter. Aref Pasha Dajani. Suleiman Bey Touken. Amin Bey Abdel Hadi. Ismail Bey Husseini. Sheikh Preih Abu Mideen.Mahmoud Eft&apos;. Abu Khadra. Omar Eff. Bitar. Wadi Eff. Bustani. Issa Eff. Bandak. Khalil Eff. Sakakini. Hafez Eff. Toukan. Haidar Eff. Toukan. Haj Shefie Abdel Hadi. Sheikh Assad Shoucair. Boulos Eff. Shehadi. Selim Eff. Abdul Rahman. Haj Tewflk Hammad. Son of Abdul Rahman Haj, Mayor of Tulkarem.His Excellency made the following statement: -I desire to thank you for your presence here to-day. You have been invited in order that I may make to you a communication on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Government, as you have been informed, has lately given very careful consideration to the question of the administration of Palestine and it has now come to certain definite decisions. As you will no doubt have anticipated, it has adopted the same view as its predecessors with respect to what is generally known as the Balfour Declaration, and, does not see its way to recede from it. That declaration has been accepted by all the Allies, including a unanimous endorse-ment by both Houses of the Congress of the United States. It is embodied in the Mandate, which has now been finally passed by the League of Nations. The Government regards this as an International obligation from which there can be no question of receding.The question of the promises that were given during the war to King Hussein, and other matters of controversy, were dealt with in the White Paper published in the summer of last year. The present Government adheres to the statement in that White Paper and to the policy therein expressed.The Balfour Declaration is, as I and others have repeatedly emphasized, a twofold obligation, and each side of it is as sacred as the other. Between these two undertakings, we consider that there has been and that there is no conflict.It has been the constant&quot; endeavour of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of myself as High Commissioner so to conduct the administration of Palestine as to do equal justice to the interests of both the parties concerned. An examination of the numerous representations made by or on behalf of sections of the Arab community shows, however, that the special position accorded to a Jewish agency, under Article 4 of the Mandate, has been the subject of frequent complaint. The agency is vested for the present in the Zionist organization. Through its officers here it has access to the High Commissioner and to Government Departments, and it has been urged that it occupied a privileged position as compared with the non-Jewish population. It was hoped that a Legislative Council, containing among the elected members ten Arabs and two Jews, would act as the spokesmen of the population as a whole, but that Legislative Council has not yet come into being, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have been considering in what way the objections of the Arab population with regard to the Jewish agency could best be met, although, as a matter of fact, no concrete grievance or hardship has resulted from the existence of this agency.It is not possible that the Mandate,!which, as I say, has now finally passed the League of Nations, can be altered, but the Government would be prepared to recognise an Arab body on the same footing as that accorded to the Jewish Agency under the Mandate. They believe that by these means they will place, beyond all possibility of question, their desire and intention to deal with absolute impartiality between the different communities in Palestine, and to fulfil to the letter the
obligations both to Arab and Jew to whioh their predecessors publicly committed themselves.In respect to Article 4 of the Mandate, the Jewish Agency is recognised as a public body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration in such social and economic matters as may affect Jewish interests in Palestine, and, subject always to the control of the Administration, to assist and take part in the development of the country. The Arab Agency would fulfil similar functions with respect to the Arab population.&quot;With regard to public works, it would occupy a similar position to that of the Jewish Agency under the terms of Article 11 of the Mandate.&quot;With regard to immigration, it would have the right to be consulted with reference to the execution of the provision in Article 6 of the Mandate that the rights of the non-Jewish population are not to be prejudiced.Further, the Agency would participate in fulfilling the functions in respect of the control of immigration which were intended to be fulfilled under Article 84 of the Palestine Order-in-Council, 1922, by a Committee consisting of not less than one-half of the elected members of the Legislative Council, that is to say, -a Committee consisting of not less than four Moslems, one Jew and one Christian.As to the composition of the Agency, I should be. prepared to consult with the leading Arabs of Palestine with respect to the best method of constituting it and of ensuring that it should be. fully representative.The Government have not prepared any settled scheme for the constitution of the Agency, bat would desire to ascertain the views of the representatives of the Arab population, should the general principle be accepted.It is intended that upon. the establishment of the Agency the League of Nations should be approached and its approval invited, so as to place it upon a formal footing. If at some future time a fully representative Legislative Council is brought into being, then the position of the Arab Agency will be brought under review.I hope I have made it clear that the Agency will not be a Legislative Body, but will bear the same relation to the Government of Palestine as the Zionist Organization. But, of course, the Government would consult it on important legislative measures which came within its scope.With respect to the Legislative Body, whenever the Arabs of Palestine express their readiness to participate either in the Legislative Council as proposed, or the Advisory Council, such participation would be welcomed. But I should like to make it quite clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government is not prepared to make any changes in the Constitution previously proposed. Judging from state-ments that have been published, the Delegation which recently visited England appears to have come back to Palestine under the impression that a change of policy in this respect is about to be conceded. They are entirely misinformed. The matter having been considered exhaustively by a Cabinet Committee and by the Cabinet itself, the communication which I have made to you embodies the whole of the conclusions which have been reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and I can give you a definite assurance that those who anticipate a further declaration in any different sense are misleading themselves and would mislead any others who accept such assurances.I am also requested by His Majesty&apos;s Government to say this further word. They regard the establishment of an Arab Agency as a very great advance in the direction of meeting the wishes of the Arab population, and they consider that it should be accepted as a settlement of the points which have ,been in controversy, at all events until some fully representative Council is established. Otherwise, if it is not so accepted, they are not prepared to proceed with it.This proposal, like the proposals for a Legislative Council and for an Advisory Council, is intended to afford an opportunity to the Arab population to share in the conduct of the country&apos;s affairs. Such participation would undoubtedly be of great advantage to the people and would also be of assistance to the Government. But it is for the people and their spokesmen to decide whether they would desire to accept the opportunity so afforded to them. -I should now be happy to answer any questions that may be addressed to me, with a view to elucidating any matters that have not been made fully clear, and would then ask your leave to withdraw. Possibly you may desire to have time for consideration before an answer is given to this proposal, and I would not wish to press you for an expression of any opinion to-day, should you prefer to postpone it.
His Excellency then withdrew for a time in order to permit of discussion of his statement.On his Excellency&apos;s return, Musa Kazem Pasha, on behalf of those present, stated that the meeting was unanimous in declining to accept the offer of an Arab Agency which would not satisfy the aspirations of the Arab people. He added that the Arabs, having never recognised the status of the Jewish Agency, have no desire for the establishment of an Arab Agency on the same basis.His Excellency expressed regret at this reply which had been given, and observed that, at all events, it could not be said that His Majesty&apos;s Government was unwilling to place the Arabs in at least as privileged a position as the Jews.Musa Kazem Pasha stated that a detailed reply would be communicated to the Government in due course, to which his Excellency replied that the Govern-ment would be pleased to receive the views of any Arab body or bodies on the subject.. 1&apos; .Annex.List of Arab Notables present at the Meeting held at Government House on thellth October, 1923.Proposed Members of the Advisory Council:1.

oDraft of Proposed Telegraphic, Instructions to High Commissioner, Palestine. YOUR despatch No. 1041, 12th October: Arab Agency.His Majesty&apos;s Government have learnt of decision of Arab representatives with great regret. They have now made three successive proposals with a view to closer association of Arab community with administration of Palestine, viz:- 1. Establishment of Legislative Council on which Arabs would have been represented by ten elected members; 2. Reconstruction of Advisory Council so as to secure effective Arabrepresentation; and 3. Recognition of Arab Agency with functions similar to those assigned toJewish Agency under terms of Mandate.Towards all these proposals Arabs have adopted same attitude, viz., refusal to co-operate. His Majesty&apos;s Government have been reluctantly driven to conclusion that further efforts on similar lines would be useless and they have accordingly decided not to repeat the attempt. Meanwhile Mandate for Palestine has been brought into definite operation, under authority of Council of League of Nations, as from 29th September last, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound to proceed with discharge of their Mandatory obligations. In these circumstances, as all their proposals for closer association of Arabs with administration have been rejected, His Majesty&apos;s Government have no alternative but to continue to administer the country in conformity with their undertakings, even though they have to forego the1 assistance that they had hoped to obtain from Arab community. You are accordingly authorised to carry on administration of Palestine with the aid of an Advisory Council. Article 3 of Palestine Amendment Order-in-Council, 1923, gives you full- discretion in this regard subject to approval of .Secretary of State.   You should proceed accordingly.
