[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]SECRET., 13CP. 487 (23).CABINET,SPECIAL REPORT ON UNEMPLOYMENT. No. 99.   Period ended November 30, 1923.WITH a view to making the report more comprehensive, and less subject to small temporary variations, I was proposing to issue these Reports each month instead of fortnightly.   This is the first Report prepared on the monthly basis.2. The actual arrangement of the Report has been somewhat modified, so as to present more clearly the figures of unemployment, and their distribution in relation both to industries and localities.3. In Part V a full summary is given under the various heads of the provision made since the Armistice from Government Funds, or other public sources, for dealing with unemployment. This summary is of importance. It will be noted it does not include provision made from other than Government or public sources, e.g., the  35,000,000 of work now being put in hand by the railway companies!C. A.

Important Changes in the Live Registers of Employment Exchangesduring the Period.Blackburn.-Decrease of 1,907 (1,047 men, 860 women) due to improvement I in the cotton-weaving industry. Large orders in voiles and fancies have been secured I for the Indian markets.Oldham.-Decrease of 1,682 (1,018 men, 664 women)&apos; due to improvement in j cotton-spinning industry.   In the American Section firms manufacturing coarse and medium yarns have bought cotton to great advantage and are running full time.Burnley.

Increase 836 (797 men, 39 women) a large number of merchant seamen have registered owing to several large liners being laid up for the winter. - -IMPOSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.Coal-mines. The coal market is steady and employment continues good generally. In Yorkshire and Durham fields work is well maintained and export trade from the North-East coast ports is in excess of that recorded for last year and for 1913. Conditions, on the Lancashire coal-field are normal, and likely to remain fairly good throughout the winter: In the Midlands house coal is in great demand; steam coal trade shows little improvement, but the export trade via the Humber Ports is brisk. Employment in the Forest of Dean is good and on the Somerset coal-field there is a tendency, to improvement and, several ,pits&apos;are-, now working full time. The positicnis not so uniformly good in Wales. The trade has suffered during the month from interruption of exports in consequence of heavy gales. Tonnage has been delayed and congestion has occurred. Although trade is fairly depressed at Merthyr, Mountain Ash, Rhondda, Port Talbot and.Swansea, employment is regular and improving in North Wales, Monmouthshire and Neath. The position has remained good in Scotland. Export tonnage shows an increase. There is very little unemployment and reports indicate that prospects are good.Stone Quarries. Employment at Portland stone quarries continues to be very good. The demands in respect of road improvements and building are sufficient to keep the quarries busy for some months. No change is reported^ from other districts. At shale mines employment continued fair. Oil shale - discoveries at Bridgwater appear to be hopeful. ,China Clay. Employment continued good, although there is diminution of activity in Cornish pits due to seasonal causes.Iron-mines. Improvement is reported in the Cumberland district and there is slightly more activity in,the Midlands. In.the Cleveland district employment continued bad. One half of the mines were idle and at others short time was worked.j
B  ------Prospects are said to be more favourable owing to development in iron and steel production.Tin-mines. There is still very heavy unemployment in this industry in Cornwall, but slow improvement continues. At Redruth, where a new shaft is being driven, hopes are entertained of considerable development in the spring.iron and steel production.Employment in the pig-iron industry, although still bad, showed a slight improvement during the month. At the end of November the number of furnaces in blast (199) showed an increase of 10 during the month and of 37 during the past year.The position in the iron and steel trade is still slack, but in some districts increased activity has already commenced and there are indications of a general improvement in the industry. The more immediate causes for hopefulness are the recent settlement of the boilermakers&apos; dispute and the extensive railway programme for the winter.On the North-East Coast no improvement is yet apparent. The Cleveland pig-iron trade is reported to have increased during the month and at Sheffield large tonnage is being melted for railway contracts. In the North-West, slight improve-ment has occurred at Barrow. Orders for steel rails have increased activity there and at Bolton. In the Midlands unemployment remains abnormal, but early revival is expected. South Staffordshire has experienced severe depression, but in North Staffordshire the position is steady and likely to improve. The pig-iron branch of the trade at Newcastle-under-Lyme has much improved. The position in Wales is good. At nearly all South Wales steel works a strong tone is shown. Employment is better and output is increasing. Except in Dowlais (Merthyr) and Cardiff&apos;, steel works are busy producing sheet and tinplate bars. Activity is assured until well into the New Year. Intermittent work at Dowlais and short time at Cardiff are prevalent, but the working week at Cardiff has increased from, three days to five days. A more hopeful outlook is reported from Scotland, particularly in the Clyde area, where orders have already been placed by railway companies for steelwork for permanent ways.  The number of shifts worked in other districts has increased. Itin-plate and STEEL SHEET.Employment continued good. The condition of the tin-plate market remains very satisfactory. The demand is good, and prices have an upwar.d.&apos;tendency. An active demand exists, for galvanised sheets, large orders having been received from China and Japan, and full-time working is assured well into the New Year.shipbuilding and ship-repairing.Employment continued very bad generally. The most important feature of the month&apos;s report affecting this industry is the settlement of the boilermakers&apos; dispute. Occurring late in the month, its effects are not yet very marked, but there has been in some districts a prompt, though limited, resumption of work.Trade in repairing work in the London yards has been below normal, except at Chatham, where 500 men have been re-engaged, and at Bermondsey. The most pronounced improvement has occurred on the North-East Coast, wherein the majority of yards resumption of work followed immediately upon the settlement of the dispute in spite of the most acute depression which existed in that area. The following numbers of men were at once re-engaged: Wallsend 200, Hebburn 429, J arrow 200, Middlesbrough 300, and the Exchange Live Registers were reduced by 347 at Gateshead and 467 at South Shields. Similarly activity has been renewed in the Channel Ports. Eight hundred men have returned to the yards at Devonport on reconditioning work and 860 at. Portsmouth. Plymouth, Avonmouth and Bristol have also benefited from the improved position. This work at Southampton yards is still slack, as some of the work of winter overhauling of Atlantic passage and other boats had previously been lost and transferred to Havre and Belfast.More activity has been displayed on the Merseyside during the month, but the full effect of the settlement of the dispute is expected to be more&apos;apparent next month. The employment position in Wales is still unsatisfactory, although temporary improvement occurred during the month, due to repairing work rendered necessary by recent heavy gales. Marked improvement has occurred in ship-yards in Scotland. Contracts have been secured during the last two months at Govan, Clydebank, [11015 &apos;   &apos; b 2
Partick, Paisley and Dundee. At Govan work has been resumed on a twin screw steamer which had been held up for two years.ENGINEERING.Employment continued bad on the whole. In London and.the Home Counties, trade is quiet, with slight improvements in some districts. A large contract for railway wagon wheels has been placed in Letchworth. Motor engineering and electrical work are more active. In the North of England the industry generally is still very slack, employing in the North-East approximately 55 per cent, of the number of workpeople occupied pre-war. Manufacturers of tyres, springs and axles for railway wagons are reported to have more work on hand and some fresh orders have been placed with the Leeds Forge Company. No substantial progress.has been made in the North-West, except in the electric plant and locomotive branches of the trade.  Textile machinery makers continue to work short time.In the Midlands, abnormal unemployment still prevails, but marked improve-ment has occurred in the Motor and Cycle branch in consequence of orders received at the Motor Show at Olympia. Firms engaged in constructional engineering are reported as busy. Trade in South Wales has somewhat improved owing to the brighter outlook in the steel and tin-plate industry. The establishment of new constructional engineering works at Swansea has eased the local situation and a large export trade is anticipated. Firms in the South-West are holding their own and in some branches the position is steady with a firm tendency. Railway works at Swindon and Gloucester, motor-car and aeroplane works, at Oxford and Bristol, are reaching a fairly high level of prosperity. A month ago this industry in Scotland was most depressed. The situation has not greatly changed, but marked improvement is considered to be probable at an early date. A large contract has been secured by a Bridgeton firm of electrical engineers for the Wembley Exhibition.TEXTILES.Cotton. Employment in the Egyptian spinning section remained good. In the American spinning section considerable improvement occurred during the month in spite of the disturbing influence of the rise and fluctuation in the price of American raw cotton. Longer hours were worked.in that section.than had been worked for many months past, but owing to the fact that individual firms are breaking away from any- arrangement for organised short-time working it is difficult to state accurately the degree of improvement as regards time worked. It is estimated, however, that quite 85 per cent, of mills in the American section worked forty-eight hours per week and the remaining mills continued to work such hours as would meet their own requirements. Employment in the Weaving section was also somewhat better than it had been during.the previous month. In the voiles and fancies section, large orders have been secured for the Indian market.Hosiery. The outlook in the Midlands is still very uncertain, slight improve-ments in various towns being balanced by depression in others. Unemployment is serious and much short time is being worked. There appears to. be little likelihood of any general improvement during, the winter. ./  &apos;Woollen and Worsted. Employment continued bad. As compared with trade in October the worsted section showed some improvement and the.woollen section further depression. It is stated in some quarters that the industry suffers keenly from French competition, whereby on the basis of about 80 francs to the pound, the foreign manufacturer is able to produce a cloth for the British market at  4 Is. 9d. per piece as against the Bradford, cost of  6 Is. Od. per piece. Suspension of Japanese tariffs as a result of the earthquake has resulted in increased activity at Batley. The trade in the South-West shows slightly increased activity, in certain areas,&apos; but continued depression in others. In Scotland there has been a slight improvement which is expected to be only temporary.Lace. Employment continued very depressed and no improvement in the general position is perceptible. The position is aggravated by the rise in price of cotton. Temporary improvement is reported in the curtain and plain net sections, but the Lever&apos;s section is very depressed.Silk. Employment continued moderate in the Eastern Counties and bad in the Macclesfield, Leek and Congleton district.
Jute. In Dundee employment continued fairly good. Improvement was continued in Porfar, where the position is satisfactory, there is still an unsatisfied demand for weavers. --&apos;     ,;:Carpets. Employment continues good.BUILDING AND BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Normal activity continues and no important change is reported. Seasonal causes have rendered outdoor work somewhat, irregular, but employment for skilled operatives is plentiful and a shortage of bricklayers, masons and&apos; plasterers exists in most parts of the country. There is little prospect of the absorption of unemployed unskilled labour until the. shortage of bricklayers has been supplied. . Painters and decorators have suffered seriously from seasonal slackness, although in some districts the position has been eased by propaganda urging the public to have indoor decorations executed during the winter, instead of waiting for the spring. In the brick and tile-making industries employment remains fairly good. Brick-making shows increased activity in Wales, hut a slight falling off at Peterborough, although employment remained good in that area. Trade is fairly good at Nottingham, but bad in Coventry, Derby, and Stourbridge areas,CLOTHING.Seasonal slackness is still apparent in the tailoring and dressmaking trades. The wholesale clothing section is moderate in the Midlands, but has declined in London. The corset trade is very poor in nearly all centres. The glove, shirt and collar trades continue to suffer from seasonal slackness, and unemployment is very pronounced. The hatting trade is very depressed and is- not expected to revive until the New Year.BOOT AND SHOE.The industry, on the whole, remains very depressed, but there is a considerable difference in the state of trade in the various districts. Trade is poor at Northampton, London, and at all districts in the South-West, Improvement is apparent at Kettering, Mansfield, Chesterfield, at Leicester, where some large orders for patent and suede shoes have been received, and at Wellingborough, where very little short time was worked, and some factories were working overtime; This trade is briskat Aberdeen and Kilmarnock, where all operatives are working full time, but employment was bad at Arbroath and Glasgow, and very quiet at Edinburgh.POTTERY.Unemployment is still abnormal, but Christmas trade has kept the position fairly steady for longer than was anticipated. During the month improvement has occurred in the home trade, and greatest activity has been apparent in.the cheaper and medium classes of ware at Stoke-on-Trent. On the whole, home trade in earthenware remains slack and export trade fair. Business has been good in glazed tiles and fair in sanitary earthenware.PAPER MANUFACTURE AND PRINTING.In the paper trade, employment is only moderate in most places, and depression is prevalent in others. Short-time working is the practice in the Birmingham area and firms in the South-West are discharging and suspending workpeople. There is little change, in the printing and publishing trade, except for the temporary stimulation due.to the. General Election.TRANSPORT. !Employment at Docks has been slightly greater during the month, but the position varies very much in different districts. A slight depression is reported in the London Docks. Unemployment amongst dock workers has increased on the North-East Coast, chiefly on account of the diminution of timber import trade due to seasonal slackness. Bristol and Avonmouth have been affected by the same cause. Improvement in South Wales has been maintained, particularly at Swansea, where heavy shipments of tin-plate have been made. In the North-West more foreign trade has been handled during the month and improvement has been more marked in Scotland. Additional coal steamers have called at Scottish ports and imports of jute have caused increased activity.
III.- SCHEMES IN RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT FOR THEWINTER 1923/24.The main schemes now in progress in relief of unemployment are : (A.) Unemployment Insurance.By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, the fourth special period for payment of benefit authorised by the 1922 Act was extended to the 17th October, 1923, and a maximum of 44 weeks of benefit was made available in the period so extended (50 weeks). The Act further provided for the institution of benefit years from the 18th October, 1923, onwards. In the first benefit year (the 18th1 October, 1923, to the 15th October, 1924) unemployment benefit may be drawn up to a maximum of 26 weeks. This benefit may be 26 weeks of covenanted or a combination of covenanted and un covenanted benefit (i.e., benefit not due in respect of contributions) or it may consist entirely of uncovenanted benefit. The payment of ^ uncovenanted benefit is subject to the discretion of the Minister of Labour, and in the first instance he authorised the payment in appropriate cases of such benefit up to a maximum of 12 weeks. The earliest date at which this 12 weeks&apos; benefit can be exhausted&quot; by persons continuously unemployed and only entitled to uncovenanted benefit is the 9th January, 1924. The Act lays down that there shall be in any case an interval of three weeks without benefit after 12 weeks of uncovenanted benefit have been drawn. The Minister has now decided to authorise the grant in proper cases of the further 14 weeks of uncovenanted benefit which he is empowered by the Act to give.(The financial contributions made by the State and employer and employee respectively are shown in Section V Table 2.)(B.) Measures in Aid of Trade.(i.) Trade Facilities Acts.The. Government guarantees the payment of principal and interest on loans raised by any public authority or other body of persons for the purpose of carrying out capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in Great Britain. The total of such loans for which guarantees may be given is  50,000,000. Up to date over  38,000,000 has been guaranteed or approved for guarantee. The most-important works so financed are two extensions of London Underground Railways ( 6,000,000 each), electrification of the South-Eastern Section of the Southern Group of Railways ( 5,600,000), and two big shipbuilding contracts ( 2,500,000).(ii.) Export Credits Scheme. iA scheme of revolving credits&apos; and insurances for export trade. Credits up to  26,000,000 may be sanctioned; it is estimated that the total amount of advances guarantees and credits likely to be in operation this winter is approximately  15,000,000.*(iii.) Acceleration of Government Contracts.The Post Office are undertaking  1,000,000 worth of work in advance of normal requirements, the War Office  450,000, and the Admiralty over  800,000, to be spent in centres where unemployment is particularly severe; in addition, the Admiralty are examining the question of laying down immediately a number of cruisers, work which will directly benefit the most severely depressed industries. The Office of Works are also undertaking arrears of work in the Parks and Gardens, and on ancient monuments, to the value of nearly  100,000.(iv.) Development and Construction Work by Railway Companies.Considerable pressure has been brought to bear on the railway companies to put in hand as soon as possible work of necessary construction, repairs, &amp;c. All the programmes have not yet been disclosed, but certain1 companies, notably the Great Western Railway, and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, have produced extensive schemes. In all, the special schemes involve some  35,000,000 worth of work, a proportion, at least, of which will begin during the winter.
(G.) Relief Works.(i.) Unemployment Grants Committee.This Committee is empowered to make grants of three kinds to local authorities and other bodies : (a.) To Local Authorities, 60 per cent, of the wages bill of works financed out of Revenue. There is  190,000 remaining from the amount authorised for last winter, and a further  100,000 has been added, making available  290,000 for the present winter.(&amp;.) To Local Authorities for non-revenue producing works, 65 per cent, of the interest and sinking fund charges on loans&apos;raised, for half the term of the loans, subject to a maximum period of grant of fifteen years. (This grant is equivalent to about 37J per cent, of the total cost of the work.).(c.) To Local Authorities and Statutory bodies operating public utility under-takings, for revenue producing works, 50 per cent, of the interest on loans raised for not less than ten years, for a maximum period of fifteen years. (This grant is equivalent to about 25 per cent, of the total cost of the.work.)Hitherto the grant has been confined to localities where serious unemployment, as certified by the Ministry of Labour, exists, but this winter grants will also be paid to local authorities whose schemes involve a substantial expenditure in material to be ordered from industries suffering from severe unemployment. This extension was designed to help the skilled workman to secure more work in his-own trade.For grants under (b) and (ti); the Unemployment Grants Committee have been authorised to assist  20,000,000 worth of work.(d.) To private companies and corporations operating public utility under-takings, grants on the same principle as in (c), subject to the conditions that the works must be those that would not have been put in hand now but for the necessity of relieving unemployment, that the grant in. respect of interest will be made only while the expenditure is not reasonably remunerative, that the company will be limited in respect of distribution of profits, &amp;c, and that the material of all contracts shall be of British manufacture.The financial limits within which assistance under (d) may be given, have not been laid down in advance; they will depend on the type and number of applications received. ,    ;.(ii.) Ministry of Transport.Under the continuous programme for the improvement and construction of main roads, the Ministry of Transport have been making grants to Local Authorities of 50 per cent, of the total cost of approved works. During the present financial year it is estimated that the total expenditure on schemes in progress under the programmes will be about  6,000,000. The figure originally given by the Ministry of Transport was  7,500,000 and was thus stated by the Minister of Labour in his speech on the 1st August. Subsequently, the estimated expenditure was reduced owing to various delays, and in CD. 597 at the beginning of November was given as-  6,850,000. The Minister of Laborrr, in his speech on tire 15th November, repeated the original estimate of  7,500,000, under the authority of the Minister of Transport. The estimate has again been reduced after .further experience by the Ministry of Transport to  6,000,000, which includes a small expenditure-accruing under the  14,000,000 programme below. ;In addition, the Ministry of Transport have recently been authorised to finance further roads and bridge schemes (the latter involving the use of steel and thus helping the iron and steel industry) to the value of  11,500,000, excluding the Liverpool-Manchester Road, the cost of which will bring the total, over  14,000,000, the figure used by the Minister of Health, and subsequently, with the concurrence of the Minister of Transport, by the Minister of Labour on the 15th November in the House of Commons.Among the roads towards the cost of which grants will be made by the Ministry, is that from Glasgow to Edinburgh. The bridges include the Queensferry Bridge, Flintshire, and the Berwick Bridge over Tweed. ..,Special financial provision is also being made for contribution towards the reconstruction of the Menai Suspension Bridge.
These schemes are all in addition to the normal maintenance and repairs of roads to which the Ministry of Transport contributes.(iii.) Port of London Dock Extension.By special arrangement a loan not exceeding  4,500,000 at a,low rate of interest for thirty years has been promised on certain conditions to the Port of London Authority for large dock extensions.(iv.) Ministry of Agriculture, and Forestry Commission.Assistance will be given to Drainage Authorities for land drainage schemes, and for the improvement in supply of water to farms, to the amount of  250,000. The Forestry Commission have also been authorised to expend  50,000 in aid of works of afforestation. , ,IV. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. * (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion Authorities concerned. In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land have been agreed with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A number of organisations, having as their object the provision of facilities for the settlement of immigrants in certain, of the Dominions, have also been assisted. An extension of this assistance to other organisations is under consideration.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the month of October and for the whole period up to date are set out in the following Table: -Dominion.           .   .

the numbers of persons insured and, in 1920 by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons.

Road and Bridge Programme, 1919/20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His&apos; Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the. Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately&apos;  9,328,000 for Great Britain, and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost approximately  20,000,000.(ii.) Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties during 1920/21, 1921/22, 1922/23, and a forecast of expenditure during subsequent years.Payments during Year.

(iii.) Port of London Dock Extension.Early in 1923, the Prime Minister was informed by the Port of London Authority that certain extensive works could be put in hand at once for the relief of unemployment if the Government would assist with a loan on favourable terms. A loan of  4,500,000 at 3^ per cent, was promised by the Prime Minister. It was arranged that this loan should be advanced from the Local Loans Fund, at the rate of interest applicable to such loans, the Exchequer undertaking to pay the difference between the annual loan charges (on the annuity basis), and the 3^ per cent, on outstanding advances to be paid by the Port. Advances were to be repaid in full by the Port at the end of thirty years from the date of advance.. Two Schemes have been under consideration. The construction of a new deep-water dock and a new dry dock at Tilbury, and of a new deep-water dock and an impounding station at the Surrey Commercial Docks. Work on the latter Scheme has been commenced, but the Tilbury Scheme, which will require a public enquiry and an order by the Minister of Transport, has, owing to certain difficulties, not yet been settled. .It is now estimated that the cost of the Tilbury Scheme will&apos;be  7,000,000, while the cost of the Surrey Commercial Dock Scheme will approximate to  585,000. The present value of the assistance promised by the Exchequer, on the basis of the loan of  4,500,000, is estimated at approximately  1,150,000:(D.) Miscellaneous. .

Since the Armistice a number of properties haye been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Settlement through Local Authorities.- These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to 1926 the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of. the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement if not conducted through the agency of County Councils./
