[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]      46*)Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1923.CONFIDENTIAL. CP. 460 (23).CABINET.;&apos; -JO 1:       AOSOLICITORSHIPS TO GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.IN circulating the enclosed correspondence for the consideration of my colleagues, I wish to make it clear 1. That I do not propose that any alterations should be made in the practice in such cases of old precedent as that of the Solicitor to the Treasury, on the one hand, or the Solicitor to the Post Office, on the other; and2. That I do not in any way question the fitness of the gentlemen recently appointed to the Ministry of Labour or the Ministry of Health.My view is, however, that expressed in the letter written upon the instructions of my predecessor on the 27th January, 1920, that where the duties to be performed are such as properly appertain to a solicitor, the person appointed should be a solicitor, and should be so described, but that where the duties are those of a legal adviser rather than a solicitor, a barrister should be appointed and should, in that case, be termed legal adviser.C.. House of Lords,November 9, 1923.Latv Society&apos;s Hall,Chancery Lane, London, W.C. 2, My Lord, January 22, 1920.IN the &quot; Times &quot; of&quot; the 12th instant it was announced officially that two members of the Bar had been appointed respectively Solicitor and Assistant Solicitor to the Ministry of Labour. The attention of the Council of this Society has been directed to this announcement, and they desire me to submit to your Lordship their view that it is not fair to the solicitor branch of the legal profession that solicitor-ships and assistant solicitorships to Government Departments should be conferred upon the other branch of the profession.The Council are aware that for many years past the solicitorships to the Treasury and to other Government Departments have been at the disposal exclusively of the Bar, and the Council have repeatedly objected to such appointments. They venture now, not merely to repeat their former objections, but to protest with the strongest possible emphasis against the extension of this principle in the case of new offices. , &apos;Your Lordship is aware of the vastly greater proportion, in importance and value, of the public offices at the disposal of the Bar than at the disposal of solicitors. Your Lordship also has on so many occasions indicated that you consider yourself charged with the protection of the interests of solicitors in equal degree with those of barristers, that the Council feel themselves encouraged, to hope that your Lordship will agree with what is here stated, and communicate your views to His Majesty&apos;s Government at the earliest convenient opportunity.I am, &amp;c. (Signed)        E. R. COOK, T Secretary.ine Right Honourable the Lord High Chancellor, House of Lords, S.W. 1.[10868]
House of Lords, S.W. 1, Sir, January 27, 1920.I AM directed by the Lord Chancellor to reply to your letter of the 22nd January As the Law Society are aware, the duties performed by the solicitors to Public Offices extend, in many cases, to matters which are outside the scope of a solicitor properly so called, and which can be performed as well by a gentleman employed from the Bar as advising counsel as by a gentleman qualified by admission to the profession of solicitor. Further, certain of these offices, as, for example, the solicitor-ship to the Treasury, have for many years been held by barristers and not by solicitors and it does not appear to his Lordship that any useful purpose will now be served by considering any alteration in the present practice so far as it relates to those offices.There are other cases, such as those of the solicitorship to the Board of Trade and to the Post Office, which are commonly held by admitted solicitors, and the Lord Chancellor is not aware that any question arises of altering the practice in this respect.Even in the case of the Treasury Solicitor, the duties more commonly appertain-ing to the solicitors branch of the profession are performed by the head of the Law Courts Branch, who is, and, as the Lord Chancellor believes, has been ever since the establishment of that branch, an admitted solicitor.At the same time the Lord Chancellor feels considerable sympathy with the view expressed in your letter. It appears to him that it may well be contended that, so far as the duties performed by the official called solicitor comprise the duty of . advising the Department, the proper title for the office is that of Legal Adviser, and that where a barrister is appointed to such office his duties should be confined to that of giving legal advice to the Department, while, on the other hand, if it is desired that a Department should have in their exclusive employment a gentleman whose name can appear on the record and who can in other respects perform the functions of a solicitor of the Supreme Court, that office should be conferred upon a solicitor.The Lord Chancellor is conscious that in recent years a custom such as that described in your letter has to some extent sprung up. His Lordship is disposed to deprecate its further extension. He was not consulted before the appointment was &apos; made to the office of Solicitor or Assistant Solicitor to the Ministry of Labour, though he has no doubt that the gentlemen respectively appointed to those offices were properly selected and are fitted to perform the duties required of them. He has directed me to communicate on the subject with the Ministry of Labour, and he proposes at a subsequent date to bring the matter generally before his colleagues.I am, &amp;c. (Signed)        CLAUD SCHUSTER.The Secretary,Law Society.(2032/3 )Sir, &apos;  &apos; - House of Lords, S. W. 1, January 27, 1920.I AM directed by the Lord Chancellor to enclose a copy of a communication which he has received from the Law Society, * and a copy of his Lordship&apos;s reply,t and to state that he wyl be glad to have the views of the Minister of Labour on the subject treated in the correspondence.I am, &amp;c. (Signed)        CLAUD SCHUSTER.The Secretary,Ministry of Labour.Ministry of Labour,8. Richmond Terrace, S.W.I, Sir, February 24, 1920.I AM desired by the Minister of Labour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th January (No. 2032/3) enclosing a copy^of a communication received by the Lord Chancellor from the Law Society, and of his Lordship&apos;s reply thereto.* The letter of the Law Society dated January 22, 1920. t Sir Claud Schusters letter dated January 27, 1920.
Law Society&apos;s Hall,Chancery Lane, London, W.C.2, Dear Sir Claud, November 2, 1923.THE appointment of solicitors to Government Solicitorships has been further considered by the Council, and I have been asked to refer you again to their letter to you of the 22nd January, 1920, and to your reply of the 27th of the same month, in which, on behalf of the then Lord Chancellor, you were good enough to-express his sympathy with the view expressed in the letter of the Law Society upon the subject of the employment of solicitors to Government Departments, and in which the then Lord Chancellor was good enough to promise to bring the matter personally before his colleagues.The Council have recently learnt with regret that upon a vacancy occurring in the appointment of Solicitor to the Ministry of Labour a barrister has been appointed to that office. They also understand that a barrister was some time since appointed to be Solicitor to the Ministry of Health. The Council very much hope that the Lord Chancellor will be good enough to bring the matter generally before his colleagues in the Ministry for the purpose of securing for solicitors the appointments of Solicitor and Assistant Solicitor to Government Departments.Yours sincerely, (Signed)        E. R. COOK, Secretary.Sir Claud Schuster, K.C.B., C.V.O., K.C., House of Lords, S.W. 1.Bear Cook, House of Lords, S. W. 1, November 9, 1923.THE Lord Chancellor asks me to say, in reply to your letter of the 2nd November, that he agrees in the view expressed on behalf of Lord Birkenhead in my letter of the 27th January, 1920, and that he proposes to bring the matter to the attention of hiscolleagues.Yours sincerely, (Signed)      CLAUD SCHUSTER.E. R. Cook, Esq.The questions raised in the correspondence are of too wide a scope to be dealt with from the point of view of this Ministry alone, and Sir Robert Home is therefore forwarding the correspondence to the Treasury for consideration in relation to the Lgp-al Departments of Government in general. He will communicate with you further on receipt of the Treasury reply.I have, &amp;c. (Signed)        D. J. SHACKLETON.The Permanent Secretary, Lord Chancellors Office, House of Lords, S.W. 1.
