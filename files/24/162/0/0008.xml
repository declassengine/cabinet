President of the. Council^All the Dominion representatives agreed, that what may be called local foreign affairs should primarily be. managed by the Dominion concerned.   The Dominion Government would of course consult the Foreign Office in respect of the negotiations but how far they were to be guided by it did not clearly appear. The Dominions no doubt somewhat differ on this point.   But leaving that detail out of account a generally similar view as to the treatment of local foreign affairs was the extent of the agreementiupon the constitutional issues.   It is true that both the Canadian and the Australian Prime Ministers considered that their Dominions should not be involved in international complications without the consent of their Governments, but this premise, led them to precisely opposite, conclusions.   Mr. Mackenzie King   deduced from this point-of departure that Canada generally speaking should have nothing to do either with the decision of foreign policy or with its consequences.   Mr. Bruce on the other head held the view that the Dominions should share in every important decision in a foreign policy which should be the foreign policy of-the Empire as a whole,   Mr. Massey1s opinion was again rather different. He agreed with Mr. Bruco that tho Dominions could not escape being; committed by decisions of foreign policy and he %oul&amp; be glad, &quot;jo be consulted beforehand - so far as possible.   But unlike Mr. Bruce he did not think this to be essential, and he was prepared to accept the decisions of Great Britain on foreign affairs and to sea har.through.General Smuts made little more than a passing reference to the bare constitutional question.   It was I understoodin/-1-
in harmony with the position of Mr. Brace;   But General smuts  full attitude upon the constitutional question is to be inferred from the rest of his speech.   To him not only must foreign policy be a function of the Empire, but its right direction is so self-evidently necessary in the interests of the whole that to disinterest himself or South Africa, as Mr. Mackenzie King -suggested for Canada, did not occur to him as possible.   Ha approached the subject just as an English Minister might approach it - as entitled to be consulted and to give his judgment upon every issue involved. As to the question whether the present arrangements are  -sufficient he said nothing beyond the intimation that satisfactory machinery ought to he provided.   Mr. Bruce was evidently aware of some of the difficulties which stand in the way of the  course he advocates and accordingly it was. part of his plan that the Foreign Office should as far&apos;as possible employ the machinery of the League of Nations to deal with the less important international questions as they arisecHow far it nuiy ba wise to face the issues raised in this discussion on the present occasion may bo disputed.   It is not easy to steer between the dangerous disinterestedness of Mr. Mackenzie Kingrs position and the cumbrous procedure involved in the idea o  Mr,, Brace, On tho other hand there    may be a greater risk in disappoint-ing men who are already rather disillusioned as to the reality of Imperial Conferences and in meeting issues sharply raised with obstruction or evasion.   If anything is to be cone - and I think something must be done - what we ought to aim at is machinery which, though of course absolutely equivalent in the case of each Dominion, couldbe/
be used or allowed to remain doinnsa&amp;t according as each Dominion might desire.   Then;solvitur ambuiendo.   Australia will find how much common action is possible, &amp;ri&amp; Canada will Isera how much common action is desirable, and we shall put constraint upon neither one nor the other.   I suggest that the only direction in which this can be achieved is by the permanent presence in London of representatives of coach Dominion, of the highest standing, us confidential as an Ambassador, but trained in political affairs, who should be -consulted by us upon all international issues of Imperial importance, should interpret the mind of their Government,and before decisions are made should act as the channel of communication between them and ourselves ao $bat a community of view may be established.The proposals of Mr, Bruce were not confined to questions of constitutional development.   Ho discussed not merely how foreign policy was to be determined but also wh&amp;t-it was to be, especially on the Koine, and he wanted this to be decided here and now before the close of the Imperial Coiiference,   General smuts  speech also was mainly directed to the actual lines upon which Imperial foreign policy should proceed.   He was far more detailed in this and only one degree less urgent than Mr, Bruce.   Mr,   Bruce was - in this respect like Mr, Mackenzie King and. Mr, MassOy - French in sympathy though ho admitted the French are unreasonable. General Smuts though broadly opposed to French policy was willing to make concessions, to France.    Though therefore the points of view were different there appeared to be no great difficulty in bringing them into line.   The thing they , both insisted on was that there must be a policy and that it was urgent,   Mr, Bruce could not go back to Australia without one; General Smuts thought that Europe was on thebrink/
brink: of irreparable disasters.Mr. Bruce&quot;s positive suggestions, for a foreign policy were not novel - first of all to await, as Lord -Ciirzon has announced, a reasonable proposal from Prance, then failing that to fix an arbitrary sum for reparations and to enlist the good offices of the United States.   We fcnow the ground too well, there is nothing doing on those crude, lines.   But it remains true that the dissatisfaction of the Dominion Governments with our conduct of foreign  v-affairs is a fact of real importance,,   We can scarcely leave it there.   If Mr. Bruce cannot help us to a positive policy, General Smuts has made a spacial study of the . Treaty of Versailles and its consequences.   What did he propose?   A moratorium to Germany and control of - her finances - wall worn proposals.   But as to reparations themselves - though I speak with diffidence - there seemed to be something new.   The suggestion was to avoid -the British question &quot;What is Germany1s capacity to pay?&quot; which the French will never allow us to enter upon, and to fix a sum on account - viz in fact Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s .2500 millions - which Germany must discharge With adequate security, and to leave all the other financial questions, the balance of Gorman liability ana the Allied cebts, ever for ten years, when an International Conference is to cleel with them.   Besides this he would have us say nothing more about the Ruhr until this new effort to settle the Separations question has been made.   There are attractive features about this proposal.   But it may be that   Franca will not accept it.   In that ease - in the last resort as it.were - he would wish an appeal for the co-operation of the United States, an appeal not merely from Great Britain but from this Conference of the British Empire here assembled.
I do not know how lord Curzon regards these proposals, I do not feel qualified to pronounce a&apos;.,confident opinion upon them.   But I think we can hardly receive Mr, Brace and General Smuts with a mere non possumus.   We must reckon with Empire opinion.   Moreover it is no good risking every-thing upon the hope of the payment of allied debts or part of them unless we think there is a real expectation of getting something,   It any rate there is not the remotest chance of getting anything this side of ten years, and General smuts  proposal does not call upon us actually to abandon these debts, and - which is much more important -it does riot ask the United States to do more than postpone them,(Int&amp;v)   S.October 10th, 1923.-5-
