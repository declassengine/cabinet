(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)CABINET.oret,HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.437(23).LONDON TRAFFIC BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I am generally in favour of the provisions in this Bill but I would call attention to two points -(l)    I think some words should be inserted in clause 9 providing that the Home Secretary shall be consulted before any Regulations are made imposing specific duties on the Police.    It is to be anticipated that some of the Regulations made under this clause will add materially to the work and the cost of the Police, and it is important that the Home Socretary,&apos; who is the authority directly responsible for tho organisation and expendituro of tho Metropolitan Force and is also concerned with Police expenditure generally,  should have an opportunity of considering and making representations to the Minister in the case of any Regulation which by imposing specific duties on the Police may affect Police&apos; organisation or Police expenditure.(2)   I suggest that clause 10(2) which provides that all fines recovered under the Bill shall be paid into the Road Fund should be omitted.    The effect of such omission will be that the finos will be paid into the Police Fund and will thus provide some contribution towards defraying Police expenses under the Bill.I am seriously concerned over the prospect of increasing Police expenditure as a result of the work required for the control&apos;: of the increasing volume of swift moving traffic.-j   ,  . W.C.B.1st November,  1923.
