Me mo r anduro by the First Ooramiss loner of Works..It is suggested that the completion of the proposed Commission or Committee of Pine Arts should consist of nine persona of acknowledged authority in matters of art.The Chairman should be a layman, and it is advisable to have one other non-professional man on the proposed Commission.    The remainder would consist of the President Of the Royal Academy, three Architects, one Sculptor, one Painter, and one Landscape dardener.After the first three years from the establishment of the Commission, two members would retire in turn each year.but would be eligible for reappointment if thought desirable.The King would nominate the members on the recommendation of the Prime Minister,Its status would be advisory with no power of veto . and with no statutory powers in the first instance,   but if lafcfer on it commands public respect, statutory powers might be given as was done in America, ,,It would advise the Government, municipalities and public bodies on all artistic questions which might be referred to it.    Its advice might be valuable on such questions as the Lay-out of public squares, streets and parks, designs for medals, coinage and orders, design and placing of statues.It
It would be confined to England in the first instance, hut could he extended to include Scotland and V/ales with consequent representation should these countries so desire.The functions of the existing advisory Sites Committee for placing of statues in London created hy my Department/would he merged into this proposed body,It will be the duty of the proposed Commission of Fine Arts to advise on the location of statues, fountains and monuments in public squares, streets and parks, both in London and the Provinces, and upon the selection of models for statues, fountains and monuments.The advice of the Commission could be sought by any authority of standing on any artistic question in the open air, such as elevations of buildings, town-planning and landscape gardening in public parks.It could also advise the Government and municipalities on designs for coinage, medals or orders, hut not of course on pictures.The efforts of the American. Commission have resulted not only in a marked improvement in the beauty and artistic character of monuments and public buildings erected in, and planned for, Washington, but also in the saving of many thousands of dollars to the Government.    Its recommendations have invariably been in the direction of simplicity and against omateness. IIThe services of the members of the Commission would of course be honorary.Ths
The success of the Commission depends largely on its -personnel.   To obtain the best panel It is proposed that the Prime Minister should recommend to the King the appointment of the first body.A Government Grant of  1/100 to  1,500 per annum would ho required next financial year, rising possibly to a maximum of  2,000 per annum in three or four years&apos; time as the work increased, to cover the cost of a Kecrotary, offices, draughtsmen, and occasional travelling to Inspect problems submitted to it.The Financial Secretary to tho Treasury, who has been consulted hy no as regards the provision of funds, has agreed in principle, subject of course to Parliamentary concurrence, and is of opinion that the amount would be most suitably presented under the vote for Royal Commission? Class VI, Vote 7., with which I am. in agreement.J.B.15th December, 1923.
