-OSOjlEKl&apos; IS THE PK0fE.7i&apos;Y OF HIS . BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTI.A Copy No .     fOA B I H El.POPLAR Memorandum hy the Minister of Health.I find it necessary to draw the attention of my colleagues to the position which has arisen as regards the administration of poor law relief in the Parish of Poplar Borough.    The Guardians of this Parish have for many years claimed to bo a pioneer body acting in-defiance of the general methods of poor law administration.    Quite frankly they claim that their policy, which is endorsed by the voters of the Parish, is to.afford full maintenance to all persons applying for it, irrespective of whether the amount which they consider full maintenance is in excess of the ordinary remuneration open to tho applicant and irrespective of the reasons which have led to him being out of work and making application to them.Thore is no doubt about their position in the natter.     It has been laid down in pamphlets (e.g. &quot;Guilty and Proud of it&quot;), and I attach a copy of a report of a speech recently made by the Chairman.    Thero is equally no doubt about their support by the votors of the Parish^.Of a rateable value just over  900,000,  400,000 represents the valuo of property owned by limited companies and other similar bodies and carrying theroforo no voting power-. Section 9 of the Representation of the People Act, 1913 removed the previous disqualification as voters, of persona in receipt of relief and, apart from the,large number of persons employed by the Guardians and the Borough Council of Poplar (and employed at a minimum&apos; wage rate of  4 per week) approximately cue person &apos;  . .    - 1 - &apos;R.JL2Lr &apos;16   (23)j;
of every five of the Inhabitants of Poplar has been in receipt of relief at any time during the past eighteen months.    The proportion of voters in receipt of relief would be somewhat higher than this, and so far- as I can forecast the situation, the strong probability is that the present party in power can look forward, as things are, to constant re-election.It is Of course claimed by the PoplarC-utFdians that the exceptional poverty of the Borough leads to poor law relief of so large a proportion of its inhabitants.     I append tables comparing the.position in. this respect of Poplar and the other Unions in. the Eastern district of London,,     It is inconceivable that the degree of poverty can account for the fact that while Poplar has at the present time 1923 people per 10?000 of the population in receipt of relief, only one other Union in London (Bermondsey) has more than, half this rate of pauperism.My colleagues may have observed that recently the Guardians had some trouble with their supporters over a proposal to reduce the scale on which relief is. given in the Union and may have been disposed to think that this indicated that the Guardians were at last appreciating the results of their,policy. I am afraid I cannot accept this view.    The reduction which the Guardians propose to make is practically forced on them by the fact that to continue at the present scale of-relief (which has not hitherto been reduced in spite of tho fall in the cost of living) meant, an addition of l/- per annum to the local rates, already 11s.6d. in the   for the half year.   *As will be seen from the appendices, poor law expenditure in Poplar, apart from largo contributions received from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, already amounts to a rate of lo/- in the pound.    The amount Poplar rocoives in aid of her rates from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund is equivalent to a rate on Poplar of 5/8fd, in the  .     0n3.y one other Union in the
Stst-em District of London has a rato for this purpose approximating to 7/8 d. in tho. poundi&apos;. The consequences of this policy to the manufacturers and other leaders of Industry in the Borough are obvious. I received on tho 5th instant a deputation representing them at which they hinted in no obscuro language at the probability that they might..be compelled to move or abandon their works, and according to recent press reports a movement in favour of a rate strikerhas begun.When Mr. John Burns was President of the Local Government Board tho question of Poplar was.already an acute one but there Was this difference between tho position than arid now,    Mr* Burns was able&apos;to issue an Order controlling the administration of relief to the able bodied and this. Order was, as a general rule, obeyed, though most unwillingly, by&apos; -the. Guardians .Sir Alfred Mond, when Minister of Health, again issued an Order, understanding that tho Guardians, would, though resentfully, accept&apos;the limitation laid down in the Order, placing the responsibility upon the Minister of Health and the Government.    The Guardians have however simply declined to obey,the Order.&apos;   They have, by statute, (Section 52 of the Act of 1834) the power, in administering an Order of this kind, of giving special treatment in cases of emergency. Such awards of relief must be reported to the Ministry within fifteen days and are only lawful ,if approved by me.    Since the issue of my Predecessor&apos;s Order, the Guardians have treated practically every case as a case of emergency and though approval has,not been given by the Ministry have continued to give relief..on exactly the same terms as they did before the Order was issued,*&quot;  3   *i
- mm- This condition of affairs is not one which has ever been contemplated by the law and the remedies provided toy law are entirely inadequate and inappropriate.    They are as follows:-,     (1j   An aggrieved ratepayer.may obtain an injunction restraining the Guardians from granting illegal relief.     The -Guardians would not obey such an injunction and ask nothing better than to become martyrs by being committed to prison for their principles.     .(2)   The   District   Auditor,has power to surcharge the Guardians with unreasonable or&apos; illegal expenditure.     The surcharge of illegal expenditure, running into thousands of pounds, upon, men of the calibre of the Poplar Guardians would be almost ludicrous even if they had not in most cases at any rate taken.the precaution of placing-their/property in the-&quot;hands of their wives,(3)   as&apos; Minister I have power&apos;to alter the boundary of any Union and in fact I have had under consideration a proposal for the constitution of a.large Union which would include the Boroughs of Poplar and Stepney and of the City of London.     At one time there were hopes that an arrangement of this kind could be made but I fear that the City of London would not now be prepared to concur in the arrangement unless allowed a representation on the Mew Board of Guardians based upon their rateable valuee    This is:  an impracticable suggestion and without their active concurrence action cannot be. taken.       .:.&apos;..,A further-, administrative remedy was suggested to me&apos; by the deputation already mentioned.     In London poor law expenditure is defrayed partly from rates and partly through a Common Fund contributed t.o by&apos;all the Unions of the Metropolis.     Repayments from the Common fund are necessarily made some time after the expenditure is incurred.     In Poplar - but not in other Unions -it has become necessary to advance, as expenditure is incurred, the
mmoneys ultimately, recoverable from the Common Fund, and Popla now owes my Department on this account 3ome . 500,000.&apos;It has been suggested, that, this arrangement places-&apos; a substantial financial weapon in. my Ixands, but 1 fear that this is not the case&quot;.&apos;.   If I reduce the amount of my advances; the Poplar Guardians will neither increase their call upon the ratepayers nor reduce their expenditure, but will towards the end of the financial half-year confront me with an empty treasury,, and applications for relief - many of which are quite legal and proper - which;they are not able to meet without a further advance.     Iff-,I.make-the-advance, my weapon has failed, if I refuse, the advance,-,the Guardians (with the co-operation of the: Council) will again intercept the moneys fee from them to the central authorities such.as the London County Council and the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and-we shall be back in the position of 1921, with,the .Guardians and Council again going to prison as martyrs on behalf...of the distressed, poor of the Borough.The question for consideration therefore is whether Poplar, is to&apos;be. allowed to continue her present ,course or whether fresh powers are to,be- obtained from Parliament,,In favour of the. first course it. may&apos;be urged that Poplar&apos; serves, a- valuable purpose as; a standing object lesson in the results of Socialistic administration.     As against this, .... however, must be set the fact&apos; that Poplarlam is an infectious disease..;   The. infection is already obvious in. London Unions -such&apos; as&apos;--Bermondcsy and&apos; in--West Ham mad: it is also; thotigh less obviously,&apos; at work in many of the -large industrial unions in the country in which, though regard is had to &quot;local conditions and rates- of wages, yet, poor law -administration -is providing far more than the- relief of destitution&apos; which the statutes contemplate, Moreover, as I have said already, the - manufacturers of Poplar are almost.desperate.
H Is abundantly clear from the experience ofmy predecessor that no half measures would be of any availand that If steps are to be taken to deal with Poplar theGovernment must be prepared to carry matters through even % Jfor the replacement of the Local Guardiana.    AJ3111, ofwhich a draft is attached/&apos;,. was approved by ,the Home Affairs::W     &apos; &apos; &apos;. n   , V       if:       &apos;    &apos;  &apos;&apos;   &apos; ...  IGommittee of the late Government for introduction in case of. Inecessity giving the Minister of Health power to transfer poorlaw administration in any Union to a body or persons nominated by him.     I have reason to believe that the MetropolitanAsylums Board, which is primarily a poor law authority, wouldbe willing, on ray nomination, to act in place of the Guardians.I have, however,: to consider the further contingencythat if the Guardians are&apos; dealt with, the Borough Council, about    I. iione third of whom are also Guardians, and who fellow the same lines of policy, may decline to function.-    It will be seen !jjthat the draft bill does not. cover that contingency. Provision j; is made by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for a procedure I; whereby on a complaint by the London County Council to the iMinistry of Health that a sanitary authority has made default an order must be made giving the authority a limited time to make good the default,     If. the default is not made good, it may    j be enforced by writ of mandamus or the Ministry may appoint the     jj London   County Council to act.    This procedure is obviously somewhat cumbrous and may bake some time to put into effect.     It  I may therefore well be that the draft bill may require expansion to provide power for the Minister of Health to supersede a sanitary authority in London, and before such bill was settled, I should require to obtain.the prior concurrence of the London County Council in the terms of it and their agreement&apos;to act if the: Poplar Borough Council does default.
I therefore propose that, with the concurrence of my colleagues, I should, definitely obtain undertakings from the London   County Council and the Metropolitan Asylums Board that they will give assistance and that the Bill already mentioned, with amendment to meet the case of a defaulting sanitary authority should be carried through in the Autumn Session of Parliament.     I am convinced that sooner or later the Government will have to deal with Poplar.     I can Bee no prospect that a reform of London poor law administration which, by establishing a central authority or otherwise, would so limit the discretion of the local Guardians as to remove the danger of Poparlism, is practicable within the next two or three years and I am satisfied that the Government cannot safely further postpone action in the matter..(Intd.)

EXTRACT-DAILY   TSUSQhAPH,4th October, 1923.POPLah   HELOT   SCALE. REDUCTION CARRIED.&apos;A special meeting of the Poplar Board of Guardians was held at the offices of the Board yesterday-evening for the purpose of considering a report of their General Purposes  Committee relative to a new and reduced scale of out-relief rendered necessary by the action of the Board last week in deciding to reduce the amount of their call upon the Borough Council by a sum of  28,000.    The meeting was of a very Quiet and uneventful nature, and barely a doUen persons had assembled outside the buildings.Mr. Edgar Lansbury, the   Chairman, said the Board wanted the public to understand that their policy had not and would not change.    The Guardians would still continue to relieve strikers or locked-out workmen or.those who for any reason whatever were not working.    The Board would never allow men on strike or who were locked out to starve while the other side to a dispute went about with but little discomfort and no starvation at all.    They still thought that unemployment was a matter for the Government,, but until the latter dealt with it the Board of Guardians would have to look after those who were unemployed and would do so. So far as out-relief allowed was concerned, the scale operating was set up two years ago, but since then the index figures of the Board Of Trade had fallen from .175 to 75, while wages all over, the county had been reduced. Despite this, the scale of out-relief of the Poplar Guardians had up to now been loft alone, and in the end they had been faced with the fact that men and women who were relieved were receiving more in relief than some men received in wages, but when it was borne in mind that a good deal of the relief came out of the pockets of underpaid people who were in work thi3 did and should, affect the matter of relief.    The Board&apos;s new scale would still in soma cases be in excess of trade union rates of wages, but they had not dealt with that from that standpoint and could not reasonably do so.The report of the c ommittee, which was subsequently adopted, showed that under the old scale a couple with six children received a total of  2.11.6, with an allowance for rent and COal,     Under the new scale the relief would be  2.1.0. with an allowance for rent and coal.     In effect, the reduced scale showed a reduction of 2s. for each child in the case of families where there were more than two children.     In the case of lone persona or widows tho scale of relief in untouched, and remains at 12,6. with an allowance for rent and coal.
