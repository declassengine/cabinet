(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)Sj[ 0 R E T OsJL^Mi^l&apos; CABINETEMERGENCY BUSINESS COMMITTEE. SEC 010)   REPORT.ASSISTANCE FOR    1, The Committso had before them tho followingIHE SCOTTISH &quot;&apos;FISHING documents (see Appendix I) respecting the conditionINDUSTRY.of the Fishing IndustryTelegram to the Prime Minister from the Editor, Northern Scot, Elgin. E.B.C. 3.Note by the Seoretary for Scotland.Memorandum by the Chief Inspector of Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Committee were informed that the present depressedoondition of the industry in Scotland was attributablepartly to high cost of production but mainly to the-  loss of the continental markets.   The proposedsubsidy for agriculture had revived the fishermen1^demand for assistance and candidates would find difficulty in explaining why agriculture, which inthe parts of Scotland concerned-was comparativelyflourishing, should be helped while nothing was proposed for the distressed fishing industry.   Onthe other hand emphasis was laid on. the.danger;ofassenting to the principle that because agriculturewas to be subsidized other industries were entitledto assistance.It was suggested that assistance might take theform of (a) a bounty on exported herring; (b) contri-butions towards oost of fuel;(o) grants in aid offreights; or (d) grants in aid of purchase of fishing gear, but the Committee felt, unable to
recommend the acceptance of any of these proposals to theCabinet,     The Committee also considers&apos;-! that it would be unwise,, at the present juncture, for the Government to offeran Enquiry, as such an offer would, in the absence of very carefully guarded words, certainly be construed as leading up to some form of subsidy,The Committee agreed to recommend:-(1) That candidates in constituencies concerned might be advised to say that they will&apos; be prepared to ask for reconsideration of the present terms on which loans are made by the Development Commissioners for the purchase of gear and that the candidates might also offer to press for a general enouiry into the host method of regaining and developing the foreign market sr.(g) That in the circumstances no reply need be sent by the Prime Minister to the telegram from the Editor of the Northern Scot,2.     The Committee had before them a letter (Appendix II)addressed to the Prime Minister from a Manchester corres-correspondent enquiring what action it was proposed to take tosafeguard the consumer against Trusts and Monopolies under the proposed Tariff.Attention was called to the Milk (Ascertainment of cost)Bill which had been prepared for introduction before the dissolution of Parliament,Tho Committee agreed to recommend that replies to enquiries on this subject should be on the following lines -&quot;Trusts and Monopolies exist and flourish underFree Trade as well as under Protection,     The wholequestion of the development of these powerfulorganisations is being carefully watched by theGovernment from the point of view of the public interestIn fact in the case of one particular industry theGovernment had prepared a Bill which but for the/
tDissolution would, it was hoped, have been.   passed into law last Session.   This Bill would it is believed, &apos;/ have provided a remedy in the case in question.&quot;QUESTIONS 3.   The Committee had. before them a letter datedRilSfiD BYEX-SEBVICS 20tjj[ November, 1923 (Appendix III) addressed to theCIVIL SERVANTS.Prime Minister by the Association of Ex-Servioe Civil Servants.The Committee agreed to recommend that the following reply should be sent to the Association:-&quot;Sir,The Prime Minister asks me to say that hs has most carefully noted the various points in the questionnaire which accompanied your letter of the 20th November.While Mr. Baldwin could not attempt at this stage to deal finally with all points of detail, he desires me to say that he is resolved to give the fullest possible consideration to the just claims of ex-service men subject to due regard to efficiency and econemy, and he regards the question of their resettlement as cf paramount importance. *Subject to these general observations, he desires me to reply as follows to the various points in the questionnaire :-1.     This question is one for the consideration of Lord Southborough&apos;s Committee, whose further Report is awaited,2.     It is understood that the Association has already put in to the Treasury a claim for a revision of the basis of remuneration of the
5 e) 9- temporary clerical and typing grades with a request for oral discussion whioh has been granted The claim will receive the oareful consideration of the Government but detailed discussion of the claim at this stage would be premature. 3.     Temporary employees in Messengerial and other Minor Grades are within the scope of the National Health Insurance Acts to the oost of which the Government makes a double contribution as State and as employer, and having regard to notmal outside practice and to the expense involved I do not think it would be po-soible for &apos;  me at the present time to give an undertaking to supplement for Government employees generally the provision made by those Acts. 4,     I agree that ex-Service Civil Servants should be fairly considered in the matter of promotion.-       Direct representation on Departmental Promotion Boards is not allowed, nor do I think ,   It should be allowed, to any Staff Association, I understand however that full provision is made for putting before Promotions Boards the views of. the staff through their organised associations, and also that individual members of the,staff may approaoh the Head of the Department direct, with the assistance of a member of the Staff Side of the Departmental Whitley Council or other member of the staff, on promotions affecting them per-sonally.The question of representation tf ex-.* service oivil servants on staff associations and
Whitley Councils appears to me to be a matter primarily for the staff themselves, but as ex-service men form 60$ of the male staff I oannot conceive that they would be inadequately represented.5.     With the general approval ^f the late House of Commons this question was remitted, by request of the Association concerned, to, a special Committee, under the Chairmanship of lord Southborough. consisting for the most part of members of the House of Commons.   This Committee had before them the claim now referred to and the then existing arrangements, and unanimously reached She conclusions which,  . though falling short of the full olaim, represented substantial improvements.   I am not prepared to go beyond the findings of this Committee. .Yours faithfully, &quot;POST OFFICE MORAHDA.4.

PI SHING INDUSTRY. IN BOOT LA HD,MEMO. BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.1,        The fishing Industry in Scotland has &quot;been depressed   -for several years.     In white fishing&apos; there was a temporary boom for a short time after the War owing to high prices and big supplies.     The herring fishing, at once felt the loss of continental markets.     In 1919 and&quot;1920 the Government agreed to schemes of guarantee and purchase which helped the herring fishermen at a net cost to the Government for Great Britain of about  1,700,000,     At the end of 1920 the. Government intimated that financial assistance must cease and the herring industry mist stand on its own legs.2,        The cause of depression in the white fishing Industry is mainly high working costs for coal, nets, etc., combined with a reduction of supplies of fish.     These causes affect both trawling which is mainly conducted by large companies and the smaller line and net fishermen.     In the herring industry the fundamental troubles are high costs of production (fuel, nets, etc.) and partial loss of continental markets owing to dislocation, closure of Russia and reduction of purchasing power,5.        The workers in the white fishing Industry have suffered through the laying up of boats.     The remuneration of the workers has been specially bad in the Scottish herring industry where a large proportion of the men are remunerated by a share in the venture and not by wages.     During the summer fishing season the return to the men for&quot;their shares in the boats, nets, or labour was in many cases negligible perhaps  3 or  4 for 12 weeks&apos; fishing In some cases the men came out with actual losses.4,        The representation that fishermen have been harder hit than the farmers is true, especially as regards the share fishermen in the herring industry.     It is also true that there is a serious risk of the break up of a race of fishermen with inherited and Irreplaceable skill.     They represent one of the most valuable classes in the Community both in peace and war.Morayshire (from which the telegram comes) furnishes a good illustration of the situation as between the fishermen and the farmers,     The County has practically only two Industries, agriculture and fishing, which is the means of livelihood of numerous populous towns and villages along the coats,     In agrfcul-ture the workers already enjoy a wage well over 30/- a week,     The fishermen following an arduous calling, have in recent times made practically nothing and it has been necessary to remind them that doles of poor relief stand between them and starvation.     In these circumstances the agricultural subsidy naturally excites demands of for similar assistance to the more distressed industry,5,        At s deputation from the industry received by me cn the 28th September, 1923, the Government were asked - (i) to guarantee to the workers a minimum wage of 50/- per week, (il) to order a general enquiry Into the condition of the herring fishing industry!The deputation made it clear that the object of (li) was to establish a case,for a subsidy.In replying to the deputation I stated that I could hold no prospect of any subsidy nor of e general enquiry being granted. 1 expressed a hope that tho approaching East Anglian fishing would Produce some improvement and this has happened to some extent.     Th/answer
answer, which amounted to a recommendation of self-help, was received with a fairly good grace.     It would be much more difficult, however, to give it now that a subsidy has been promised to agriculture.The great trouble as regards the Scottish fishing, however, is that working costs have greatly increased while themarket price for cured herring in continental markets, is limited although there is a large demand at a sufficiently low price.6.        The main market for the white fishery is in Great Britain.     A subsidy on railway freights would help this Industry In the home market.7.        Herring fishery.     One way to help this Industry is a bounty on the export of cured herring.     This would enable more herrings to be disposed of abroad at the cost of the taxpayer in this country.     It would be beneficial to share fishermen and other workers in the industry.An alternative method of assistance would be a subsidy on the coal and oil used by the fishing vessels.The remedy suggested in the telegram, viz: a grant towards   purchase of fishing gear, is not likely to be satisfactory.     It could scarcely bo confined merely to a grant for gear whioh would be replaced in any event, Inevitably it would Increase the catching power and It is inexpedient to Increase the catching mower and the catch when a paying market is not available.     Credit facilities for the purchase of gear might be of some assistance.     As, however, the fishermen have not responded to a suggestion made earlier this ye&apos;ar that they should apply to the Development Commissioners on a co-operative  -basis an offer of similar assistance would probably not be much esteemed at the present juncture.8.        Exports of cured herring from Scotland In the year 1913 amounted to about.1,400a500 barrels,,     On this basis a bounty of (say) -5/- per barrel would involve an expenditure of  350,000.     There would doubtless be a demand for a bounty for export from England and Wales.9.        It would probably be advisable to make any such bounty temporary or elastic so that it could be abolished or reduced if exports expanded naturally and rendered the bounty unnecessary.
-Mamoranauin by Jho^chief:inspector bf ffisho rios-The proposal in tho telegram from Elgin to the prime Minister that a grant should be made to enable fishormen to purchase now nets does not directly affect England and Wales as- no such demand has been put forward on behalf of the English drift fisherman, for the reason that the nets are supplied by the owners of the vessels and not by the fishermen, as is the oaso in Scotland.,So far as Scotland is concerned, this same proposal was put forward last summer and wa3 rejected because, with the nets at their disposal5 the Scottish fishormen wore catching more fish than tho marmot could  .. absorb and many had to be thrown away.   It was, however, realised at that time that, generally ape a icing, the stock of nets in Scotland was worn out and would ce.vta.jaly have, to a large dogreo, to he replaced after the autumn fishing. The question whether tho fishormen will then be able to replace them without assistance will dopend upon the financial resulta of that fishing which will not close until the end of tho -resent months would sugeest that tho reply to the telegram should be to the effect that the question of giving the fishermen assistance in procuring new nets will be considered sympathetically when the financial results of the autumn herring fishing is known,.At the sane time, I do not thini tint any assistance should be given unless it ia found to be absolutely accessary in order to enable the herring fishing&apos; industry to
contihuo.    The whole policy of both Fishery Departments has, for the past two years, been directed to placing the herring fishing industry upon a sound economic basis by reducing the cost of production to an absolute minimum in order that thoy may compete successfully with their riysls on the Continent,. particularly the Norwegians. In. order to do this, it ia necessary that they should use their nets until they are absolutely worn out and should be able to purchase nets at the lowest possible prices, but the inevitable result of the grant of such a subsidy as is proposed would be to cause many that to bo abandoned which are capable of further use, and to raise the price of new nets, as the net-makers are certain to take advantage of the enhanced demand.Incidentally, the reason wh^ it is stayed in the telegram.&quot;that a subsidy to keep up the price of herring per oran, as was &quot;granted, in ,1919 and .1920, would bo no use&quot; is that,. during m.ost. of this month, tho price of herrings has.-,.&apos;.at Yarmouth&apos; and:Lowostoft,-been much greater ; tnan any -minimum:price-which is likely.to b-o fixed.fis Hs (k Mr.Sprot! e telegram: does no t.suggest any ..particular form; of. assistance , .&apos;but merely su^ests tiiat Fishingishpuld have iassistance because : assistance - is being given to - -i Agrioulture.   It does not specify that it is intended that the assistance should be confined to the herring fishery, but, as the telegram comes from that part of Scotland, presumably it is so, and I think a telegram might be sent to him also on the lines suggested above,A suggestion has been made that the assistance to the herring fishing industry might tame tho form of a bounty
of .30 muoh upon each barrel exported, but, at the moment, I cannot see any necessity for anything of the kind. The stocks of herring in Europd are at prosent so small and the amount of herring already cured, or likely to bo cured this autumn in this country, is so moderate, that I do not think that the ourers will hare the least difficulty of disposing of it at remunerative prices.   A bounty might induco some of the less substantial holders of herring to dispose of it at once for lowor prices instead of holding on until they can get the full price, but if this occurred the foreign consumer would get the benefit of the bounty.On the question of tfeo fishing industry generally, . there is no doubt that all classes of fisherman - whether engaged in trawling, lining, saining or drifting - are going through an exceedingly bad timo, but if thoy are to be assisted it is probable that a high tariff on imported foreign fresh fish would be more beneficial to them than any form of subsidy. &apos; At the present time in the trawling industry alono something like 100 vessels - or about 5f0 of the trawling fleet - are laid up whilst, on the other hand, something over 5fo of the fish consumed in this country is brought in from foreign countries.   If the foreign fish was excluded these vessels would all be put into commission and would give direct employment at sea to over 1,000 mon and certainly an equal number on shore.   Tho.British consumer would not suffer in tho least degree as the amount of fish brought in would be exactly the same and tho relation between supply and demand, which regulates the price, would be unaltered.t November, 1923.

The protection was not &quot;passed on&quot; because they assumed that protection meant for their particular protection.Can you inform me what kind of safeguards are suggested by you, in order that the country generally - and the man in the street individually - shall receive the benefits to which he is entitled?I am a voter in Rusholme Division, Manchester (Mr. Thorp&apos;s seat) and although I would not vote against him., it may be that many like myself - being doubtful about creating monopolies - may abstain. * &apos;I am not asking too much as a British citizen,when I say that I expect a reply.

Penny Postage.Prospective members of Parliament may be asked for assurances that they will, if elected, urge upon the Government the necessity of a reduction in the present postal oharges and the immediate re-establishment of the Penny Post,Letter postage was reduced from 2d. to 1-^d. in May 1922,     The present Government in May of the present year increased the weight limits from the lid. post from loz. to 2 oz.     The rates for parcel postage were considerably reduced at the same time, and other postal concessions made.The Postmaster General has stated that he is anxious to see penny postage restored at the earliest possible moment, but the restoration of the penny post would Involve a sacrifice of revenue of  5^000,000 and until the financial position for next year is clear, no assurances can be given as to when It Will be possible to restfore the penny post,
Post Offige Automatic Telephone Contra rb.Mr. J.M. Hogge, late member fcr Edinburgh (East), recently stated in a letter, widely published in the Press, that the Post Office is proposing to spend  1.000,000 en importing automatic telephone apparatus from America for installation in London.,     That statement is without foundationThe agreement to which he referred expressly provides that all the plant shall be of British manufacture, except in so far as the Engineer-in-Chief to the Post Office gives authority in writing to the contrary.     No authority to import has yet been given or asked for-     If any imported apparatus is required, which is doubtful, it will consist only of a few special parts which are not obtainable in this Country.       Probably at least 99% in value of the apparatus will be.manufactured in a British factory by British labour.The Company with ,which tho agreement has been made is the Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Company, Limited, whose ,factory is at Liverpool.     It is a British Company, with a British Board of Directors,  and under British manage-ment.

They are Committees of Employers and Employed, with impartial Chairmen;   their duty is to fix wages in unorganised trades - wages which shall be fair all round - fair to the worker because they keep up his standard - fair to all the employers in the trade because the wage to be fixed is suoh as the trade oan reasonably stand, and because unfair under-cutting betweon one employer and another is thus prevented,la 1922 a strong Committee, of which Lord Cave was Chairman, with leading representatives of Employers and Employed, oame nnanimpusly; to the conclusion that the Trade Boards were of value as a safeguard against &quot;sweating&quot;.This is the polioy of the Government, and the Minister of Labour has introduced a Bill embodying the Recommendations of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee.Itemember the Prime Minister&apos;s*words at Swansea on the lsth October&quot;Among the mass of our people, wherever they are &quot;situated, every effort should be made to save the &quot;standard of life from being reduced&quot;.
