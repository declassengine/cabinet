Copy Mo,CJUT^KT. AGRICULTURAL POLICY. Hote by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.In pursuance of the decision of the Cabinet on the 29th Octobor [Cabinet 51 (23) Conclusion 3 (d)], I circulate herewith a copy of a letter I have received from the National farmers&apos; Union of england and Wales and of Scotland, together with kemoranda on the subject by myself and by Sir Pr&amp;nois Ploud, the Permanent Socrstary of tho Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.R.A.S.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 6 th K ovember, 192 3.
Copy of letter from the &quot;National Farmers Unions of angland and Wales and of Scotland.pear Sir Robert Sanders,Position of Arable Agriculture.Following upon our interview with the Prime xlinister on 11th inst., we at once took steps to comply with his request that we should furnish him with information as to our views upon the cost that would be involved to the State if effective steps were to be taken by the Government to maintain the existing acreage under arable cultivation and the existing number of workers employed on arable land.In approaching the matter we recognised quite clearly that any opinions we expressed through you to Mr-Baldwin were simply intended for his guidance in submitting the matter to the Cabinet, and that we should not be regarded in so doing as making any demand for State assistance, since, as we have always conceded, farmers can and will in the long run -:. adapt their.business to the policy of the State whatever it may be, and It is for tho nation to say what is required of the industry in the way of food production.   In these circumstances all we asked was a definite Statement of Government Policy, le placed the position arising out of our Interview with the Prime Minister before specially convened meetings of the Executive Committees of County Branches of the National Farmers1 Union (of England and Wales) and before a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Farmers&apos; Union of Scotland.With the approval of our two organisations we have to inform you that only two methods appear to us to be practicable as offering any hope of a solution of the problem of stabilising arable cultivation, viz., protection and subsidies.   With regard to the former, we have no data which would enable us to indicate any scale of duties, whether fixed or sliding, necessary, in the existing and prospective condition of foreign trade and exchanges, to secure the object in view.That
That object, in our opinion, would, on the basis of existing costs and prices, be attained by the grant of an annual subsidy of not less than  2 per acre on all arable land, subject to the maintenance by individual recipients of the subsidy of the existing arable acreage and the number of workers now employed and to tho payment of a minimum wa;.e of 50/- to able-bodied adult male workers for a week of 52 hours.   For the purposes of this suggested subsidy arable land should be deemed to be all land ploughed during the particular cereal year - Including summer fallow plus land under first year&apos;s seeds.   The total cost to the Exchequer would be approximately  22 millions per annum.Having in mind the importance properly Pttached by the Prime Minister to the limitation of the burden to be put by any scheme upon the Exchequer, we venture to submit an.alternative scheme, which, while not   guaranteeing   the maintenance of the existing arable acreage or the retention of the existing number of workers, would on the basis of present costs and prices we are convinced go very far to check the present serious decline in both.   This is the payment of an annual subsidy of  1 per aore on all arable land as before designated upon the application of the individual farmer concerned and the production of evidence by him of the payment of a minimum wage of 30/- for a week of 52 hours to able-bodied adult male workers employed during the year: farmers making no application for the subsidy to be &apos;free from any liability in respect to the conditions attached thereto. -The cost to the Exchequer would vary with the measure of success achieved in checking the decline of arable cultivation, but would not in any case oxceed  11 millions per annum.If the broad linos of policy outlined above should commend themselves to the Cabinet, we should be happy to disc-uss the details involved, with yourself or any others concerned.In
In accordance with Mr. Baldwin&apos;s request we havetreated the matter so far confidentially, but we feelthat subject to your approval the terms of this communication should now be made public.yours faithfully,(Signed)     II. GERMiv.President - National Farmers&apos; Union of England and Wales.(Signed) JAS. LENNOX.President - National Farmers&quot; Union of Scotland.
1.NATIONAL FARMERS1 UTiTOM.PROPOSALS AS TO ARABLE LAMP. Memorandum by-the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesiIn the event of the principle of subsidy being admitted, the question arises whether it should * as proposed by the N.F.U., be on all arable land or on wheat alone.Tho proposal for all arable is favoured not only by the N.F.U. but, as I gather from Pretyman, by the Agricultural Committee In the House of Commons.     It would have the advantage of giving relief in cases where distress is worst, e,g. on the light land in Lincoln and Kor-elk that will not grow wheat.     It would, I think, be justifiable if given as compensation to agriculture for not getting measures of protection that may be extended to other industries.   If this course is adopted, the H.F.U. proposal commends itself to me in principle,   I think there are great advantages in fixing by statute a minimum wage which would be a sine qua non to the receipt of the subsidy.   I prefer this very much to wages boards and although it is true that It will not in theory, extend to gross ff-rmers, as a matter of fact it would be very difficult for them to p;:y loss than their neighbours.      30/- a week is the minimum for which the Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union has been fi.cjh.ting.     I do not think the 52 hours can bo sustained.   There would have to be provisions as to rent, and as to modification in tho event of a considerable rise in prices ,On the other hand, it is, I think, more easy to defend a subsidy on national grounds if it is confined to wheat.     Y*e are Pledged to put a duty on malting barley.   That would leave out oats.   There is no doubt that Scotland would press strongly for a subsidy on oats, but Scottish farmers are doing quite well as far f-a 1 can ascertain.   If the Cabinet desires it, I will get out a scheme as quickly as possible for a subsidy to wheat alone,
.j J) 1but with a g^od deal of hesitation I should advise in favour of the larger scheme.I append a detailed memorandum on the scheme and its alternatives by Sir Francis Floud.(sgd.) r. a. Sanders.-istry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 1st October, 1923.
THE AGRICULTURAL PROBLEM.Memorandum by Sir Francis Floud on the National Farmers1 Union letter of the 25th October, 1923.1.    The National Farmers&apos; Union begin by expressing the opinion that the maintenance of the present arable area and the continuod employment of the present number of labourers cannot be guaranteed for loss than an annual subsidy of  2 per acre on all arable land.   This would cost  22,000,000 a year and the Union guard themselves by basing the amount of the subsidy on existing costs and prices, so that they leave themselves free to demand an Increase If there should be a further fall in prices.2.    It is certain that this proposal is excessive and it is probable that the Union has no expectation that it will be accepted snd has only put it forward for the purpose of bargaining.   It is inconceivable that Parliament would agree to pay  22,000,000 a year for no greater production or employment than we are getting at present.3,    It Is true that the Union is prepared to agree to a minimum wage of 30/- a week of 52 hours but this is a very small concession.   In Norfolk, which is a low wage county, the present minimum Y/age is 25/- for 50 hours, which is equivalent to 26/- for 52 hours, so that the maximum increase to any labourer would be V- a week.   For the country as a whole however it would be a good deal less and in many parts of the North of England and in the whole of Scotland a minimum wage of 30/- a week of 52 hours would mean no increase at all in existing rates of wages.   Moreover the Labour Party will resist vigorously any minimum based on a week of more than 50 hours and they will no doubt press for a higher rate than 30/-.4.    A subsidy of  2 an acre on arable land would mean that a farmer in the Eastern Counties with 300 acres of arable employing 12
e) 9 3paid on the average 27/- a week would receive from the State  600 8year out of which he would have to pay &quot;just under  100 a year in additional wages and would be left with  500 a year for himself * This i/ould In most cases more than-pay the rent of his whole farm and would be a pure gift for which the State would receive nothing additional *5*      I presume therefore that the Government will not look at the suggestion of a subsidy of  2 an acre and that we can proceed to consider the alternative proposal made by the National Farmers&apos; Union.      That is that/ while they cannot guarantee either the maintenance of the existing arable area or the continued employment of the existing number of labourers, they think that a subsidy of  1 an acre would go very far to check the serious decline in both.      The Union suggests, however, that this subsidy should only be paid to those farmers who claim it and who pay such labourers as they employ not less than 30/-a week of 52 hours,6.      This proposal is deserving of more consideration, but I think the Union takes an unduly cautious view of its effect. I don&apos;t think there can be much doubt that a subsidy of  1 anacre is ample to maintain and would probably increase the present arable area,     If so, it would also secure the retention of the existing number of labourers;     There seems no reason therefore why such a subsidy should not be coupled with conditions requiring the maintenance of the present arable area and the continued employment of the same number of labourers as well as the payment of a minimum wage.7.     The suggestion that farmers who do not apply for the subsidy should be free from any conditions seems to me imprac-ticable,   I understand that the National Farmers1 Union attach a good deal of Importance to it, but I cannot imagine that Parliament, when they were voting large sums of money as a
subsidy to agriculture, would agree that the question whether a labourer&apos; got any benefit should be left to the whim of each individual employer.. The optional system would result in a subsidy being paid in every case where present wages are equal to or above the minimum whereas in low wage counties it might produce no improvement in the labourers lot if his employer for any reason preferred to be left free,   The bait of a sttbsidy of  1 an acre would probably be sufficient to attract practically every farmer who had any arable land, but grass farmers who were net eligible for the subsidy could continue to pay wages below the minimum.   At the same time it would be difficult for such farmers to keep their labour at wages below those paid by their neighbours, and on every ground therefore it seems desirable thet any conditions attached to a subsidy should be enforced on all farmers, though this will be opposed by the National Farmers&apos; UnionjQi     The proposal that the condition as to wages should take the form of a flat rate minimum of 30/- a week .for the whole country is open to a good deal of objection.     As has been pointed out, wages vary considerably In different parts of the country.   At present minimum wages range from 35/- a week in tiorth Lancashire to 25/- a woek in liorfolk and Oxfordshire and probably not less than 40 per cant of the labourers are receiving wages In excess of the rainimn...     I think it is most desirable that wages should be fixed In relation to local circumstances Rnd the Labour Party will undoubtedly press for this.     Even the farmers would probably not object particularly if they were/ not saddled once again with a Central Wages Board,9.    This difficulty might be got over by a modificationof the present system of Conciliation Committees.     these committees have had a good deal of support from farmers locally,and generally farmers are not opposed to the system of collective bargaining.
^ tj 9 oThe modification suggested is that wages should be fixed by Agreement (as at present), but failing agreement there should be power for the Minister to add to the Committees three appointed members the rate then being fixed for six months or a year by a Vote of the Majority.   These added members would not he permanent members of the Committee and would only be added for this purpose when the Committee were unable to come to a decision,   In a large number of cases, the mere existence of this provision would in itself be sufficient to make the Committee come to terms, and would help to prevent either side from being unreasonable,   The Agreements would need to be registered and enforceable.It is possible that this scheme would be accepted (after some opposition) by both sides,10*   If therefore the Government have decided in principle on subsidising agriculture) there is much to be said for pro-ceeding by Way of a subsidy of not more than  1 an acre on arable land coupled with conditions as to the maintenance of the present arable area, the employment of the existing number of labourers and the payment of minimum wages to be fixed locally on the lines suggested above,11.   If however this system is intended to be permanent it would seem desirable to provide for a variation of the amount of the subsidy annually in relation to the prices of agricultural produce.   If prices improved materially it would bo indefensible to continue to pay as much as  1 an acre, and If agricultural prices were in closer correspondence with the general level of prices as indicated by the Cost of Living Index Number farmers would not have much ground for complaint,&apos;. .12,   It is suggested therefore that if the subsidy was given at the rate of  1 an acre on the basis of present conditions
it might be varied according to the difference between the Agricultural Index Number and the Cost of Living Index Number. At present the Agricultural Index Number Is 55 and the Cost of Living Index Number is 73, and the subsidy could be decreased as the two Index Numbers got nearer together and be removed altogether if they coincided.13o   With regard to the definition of arable land, the National Farmers&apos; Union suggest all land ploughed during the year including summer fallow plus land under first year&apos;s seeds.   This definition excludes olover and rotation grasses which have been down for more than one year and also small fruit orchards and hops.   On the whole this definition is a good one, but I think it will be difficult to exclude small fruit and hops both of which employ a large amount of labour.     It is true that hops are already protected to some extent at present, bvit the hop industry is none too prosperous and though small fruit is not un-pr-ofitable the industry is subject to severe competition and has special difficulties in connection with transport and marketing. If small fruit and hops wore included in the area subject to the subsidy it would add 95,000 acres to the area.14.   The cost of a subsidy of  1 an acre on arable land so defined would be approximately  11,100,000 in the first year and it would be more in subsequent years if as is quite possible) it resulted in an increase in the arable area.  &apos;&apos;15, a subsidy on these lines could be distributed without any serious increase of staff, though it would be necessary to arrange for some inspection and checking of claims and returns. It is assumed that the minimum wage provisions will not include the appointment of Government inspectors to see that the lav/ is enforced, but that the labourers will be left to enforce thoir own rights by civil proceedings.
16.   It should be noted that nothing is said by the National Farmers1 Union on the question whether there should be any control of cultivation oi? penalisation of bad farming, though this was ah accompaniment of the assistance given under the Corn Production Acts and it will undoubtedly be pressed strongly by the Labour Party in Parliament.   It Is certain, however, that farmers will object vigorously to any relmposition of control, and If they found that it was an inevitable corollary of a subsidy I am not sure that they would not prefer to be left alone altogether.17.   There la one further point which should be mentioned. A subsidy on arable land, if it is intended to be a permanent system, must have reactions on the question of rent and capital value of land.   A permanent subsidy of  1 an aore on arable land is bound in time to be reflected In higher rents and increased capital values and consequently any proposal of the kind is bound to give rise to a demand for some restrictive measures to prevent the benefit of the subsidy accruing to the landowners.   Some rather ineffective provisions of the kind in regard to rent were included in the Corn production Acts, but they did nothing to prevent a considerable appreciation of capital values, of which many landowners took advantage by sale.   It is obviously very difficult to control this and the whole subject raises serious political difficulties.I propose to discuss in a separate memorandum some possible alternative methods of subsidising agriculture,(Sgd.)   F.L.C. FLOUD.inistry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 30th October, 1923.
SUBSIDIES TO AGRICULTURE.Memorandum by Sir Francis Floud.1,     In another memorandum 1 have discussed the proposals of the National Farmers Union for a subsidy on arable land, but before any decision la arrived at on the subject I think it is desirable to consider whether any other method is preferable to attain the object in view.2.    In the first place it may be as well to say a few words on the relative merit3 of subsidising acreage or output.    At first sight it would appear that the best course would be to subsidise output on the ground that it ensures that payment is only made for value received and that It encourages the good rather than the indifferent farmer.     Indeed both the Miner Committee on *&apos;ood Production and the Selborne Committee on Agricultural Policy recommended that method, i.e. a guaranteed price per quarter produced not per acre cultivated.     On the other hand the Corn Production Act and the Agriculture Act proceeded on the acreage basis.     This was decided upon because the administrative difficulties of a bonus on output proved very serious and because it was considered desirable to glvo some advantage to the poorer soils on which output is low and costs of production high.     A bonus on output would involve detailed supervision, of threshings and the employment of a large army of inspectors, and if the bonus was payable on total output and not merely on corn sold there are obvious difficulties&apos; in dealing with the corn which is consumed on the farm.3.    For these reasons I think It will be found impossible to subsidise output and that any subsidy must be based on acreage. If that is so, the question to be considered is in respect of what   I land or what crops is the subsidy to.be paid.     The Corn Production I Acts provided for an acreage subsidy on wheat and oats, but I am sure that it ia useless to contemplate any return to a subsidy on
oats.    it wag the size of the payment in respect of oats that caused the repeal of the Corn Production Acts, and it is probable that if the subsidy had been confined to wheat and a consequent payment of not more than  6,000,000 a year the Acts might still be in force.     It must be remembered that the original intention was to confine the bonus to wheat, and oats were only included to meet the claims of Scotland and Wales.     Those claims will no doubt be pressed again, but it is very doubtful if there is really any need at all to subsidise Scottish farmers, and the farmers of f/ales, who depend mainly on grass, are In much less need of help than the wheat growing districts of England.4.    I consider, therefore, that if any particular crop is to be subsidised it should be wheat and wheat only.     wheat is the premier agricultural crop, it is the main factor in the maintenance of arable farming in England, it is the most essential foodstuff and it is the crop which has suffered most by the fall in prices. The present price of wheat is only 19 per cent, above pre-war, whereas oats and barley are 30 per cent, and most other agricultural products from 40 to 70 per cent, above pre-war.     The index number for agricultural produce generally is 53 per cent, above pre-war. Moreover all the indications are that the price of wheat is likely to fall still lower in the near future.5.        I suggest, therefore, that a subsidy on wheat growing should be considered as a possible alternative to a subsidy on arable land.     The question of food supply in time of War, which in the main means wheat, is being considered at present by the CoiKmittee of imperial hefence.     If they report that on defence grounds it is desirable to stimulate wheat growing in this country, the case for a wheat subsidy will be very strong.6.       The following are the principal arguments in favour of a *heat subsidy:-(a) Wheat is the crop which most deserves and needs assistance.(b) The general public would probably accept and2.
understand a wheat subsidy more readily than a subsidy on arable land.     The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; campaign for a bonus of 2/-a bushel on home grown wheat has prepared the ground.The visible results of a wheat subsidy in the form of increased production would be greater than in tho case of a subsidy on arable land.The cost of a wheat subsidy would bo less than the cost of a subsidy on arable land.A stronger case can be made out for subsidising wheat on grounds of national defence&apos; and insurance than for a subsidy on arable land.A wheat subsidy would not raise the questions of rent and control &apos;0f cultivation in anything like the same degree as a subsidy on arable land.A wheat subsidy would probably result in maintaining the arable area almost if not quite as much as a subsidy on all arable land.If wheat growing is made profitable there is much less danger of over production of other forms of agricultural produce with the consequence of serious depressions and fluctuations of prices.A wheat subsidy would give special help to tho heavy clay lands which are particularly expensive to cultivate but are usually well adapted to wheat growing.A wheat subsidy would be easy to administer, and it would not raise the difficulty&apos; v/hich is inherent in an arable land subsidy, coupled with a condition that the area must be maintained, of determining the basis of payment in cases whore farms are split up or portions cut off for non-agricultural purposes.On the other hand there are objections to a wheat subsidy ay be summarised as followsIt would not be anything like as acceptable tothe general body of farmers as a subsidy on arable land.
Out of tho 400,000 agricultural holdings in England and Wales, only about 130,000 or less than one-third are producing any wheat.     Consequently if minimum wage provisions or control accompanies a wheat subsidy two-thirds of the fanners will get&apos;no direct benefit while being subject to restrictions and increased coots.(b) A wheat subsidy would not give much help to Wales and very little to Scotland though on the other hand Scottish agriculture is not unduly depressed.   But the political difficulty of largely ignoring Scotland and Wales might be serious.(c) A wheat subsidy might have the effect that a good deal of unsuitable land would be put into wheat for the sake of the subsidy, with the result that there would be no net Increase or even a decrease of total production from the land.8.      On the whole 1 am inclined to think that on agricultural -and national grounds the balance of advantage is in favour of a wheat subsidy, but on the other hand it may raise more serious Parliamentary and political difficulties than a subsidy on arable land. If, however, the Committee of imperial Befenoe report strongly in favour of stimulating wheat production I think it would turn the scale in favour of a wheat subsidy.9.     If the Government decide to proceed by means of a wheat   j subsidy, I think that for the reasons given in my previous memorandum it should be based on acreage and not 1 on output.     The &quot;Daily Mall&quot; proposal of a bonus of 2/- a bushel would be equivalent to  3.4.0. an acre on the average production of 4 quarters to the acre.     I think that a subsidy of  3. an acre would have material results in increasing the wheat area.     It would cost at present under  6,000,000 per annum, but it would rise in so far as the present area was increased.
10.     I think it would be necessary to provide that the amount of the subsidy should vary in accordance with the price of wheat.     I would not suggest that the variations should be carried out by the method adopted in the Agriculture   Act which was intended to secure to the farmer his bare cost of production. That method involved the ascertainment each year of the average cost of producing a quarter of wheat.- an almost impossible task, and the varying conditions throughout the country render an average cost of production particularly fallacious.     I suggest that if the subsidy was fixed in the first instance at  3. an acre on the basla of a wheat price of 40/- a quarter, it should be varied up or down each year on the basis of the average market price of wheat in the preceding 12 months.11.     If the Government decided on this method lt would be possible to pay the subsidy on the basis of the returns made in June last as soon as the necessary Parliamentary authority could be obtained.(Signed)    P.L.C.
