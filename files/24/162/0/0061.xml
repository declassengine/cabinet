Part I.-INTRODUCTORY.An examination of the Terms of Reference to the Sub-Committee, which&quot;art given on the preceding page, reveals that the enquiry covers the following separate but closely connected groups of questions(1.) The co-operation and correlation between the three Services from the point of view of National and Imperial Defence (see Part II).(2.) Their co-ordination, whether by means of a Ministry of Defence or otherwise1, liC    &apos;.&quot;   (see Part III).&quot;(3.) The relations of the Navy and Air Force as regards the control of Fleet air work (see Part IV).(4.) The corresponding relations of the Army and Air Force (see Part V).(5.) The standard to be aimed at for defining the strength of the Air Force for purposes of Home and Imperial Defence (see Part VI).The whole of the above questions were dealt with, though not in the same order, \by the Sub-Committee itself, which is hereafter referred to as the Committee or the Main Committee, with the one exception of item (3), which was remitted to a special Sub-Committee composed of- Lord. Balfour, Lord Peel, and Lord Weir.2. Between the 15th March and the 31st October, the Main Committee has held 19 meetings, in addition to the 12 meetings of the. special Sub-Committee, making a grand total of 31, meetings. The evidence of the Chiefs of Staff of the Fighting Services has been heard at great length on all the subjects discussed. The special Sub-Committee heard 16 witnesses. No less than 67 Memoranda were furnished to the Main Committee and 19 to the Sub-Committee, a total of 86 Memoranda. These include. Memoranda on the. question of a Ministry of. Defence by the following authorities outside,the Government service (see Part III) :-r-Lord Midleton. Lord Haldane. .;.. .Major-General Seely.Sir Eric Geddes.Field-Marshal Sir William Robertson. Major-General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston. Major-General Sir J. H. Davidson. Major-General Sir Frederick Sykes.In addition, the Committee derived useful information from a report called for by their special Sub-Committee from Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Harington, General Officer Commandins-in-Chief, Allied Forces in Occupation in Turkey (N.D. 16). &quot;  &apos;On the 18th June, the Chairman, accompanied by the Secretary of State for India and Lord Weir, received a deputation from the Parliamentary Air Committee. The deputation attended primarily with&apos; the object of presenting views on the question of the relations of the Navy and Air Force, but touched on many of the related questions which were before the Committee.Part II-CO-OPERATION AND CORRELATION BETWEEN THE THREE SERVICES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF NATIONAL AND IMPERIAL DEFENCE.3. At the outset of the enquiry the Committee agreed &quot;that the term &apos;&apos; National and Imperial Defence &quot; could properly be defined as &quot;Defence of Territory and Defence of Communications.&quot; In order to establish the principles of co-operation and correlation between the three Services from the point of view, of National. and Imperial Defence, it was found necessary to make a careful examination of the responsibilities of the three Services in this matter.
Pre-War Responsibilities of the Fighting Services.4. The main responsibilities of the Navy, as they were regarded before the war, were set forth in a Memorandum by the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Principles of Imperial Defence (No. 61-C, dated the 8th July, 1910) in the following terms:- &apos;. -&quot; The maintenance of sea supremacy has been assumed as the basis of the system of Imperial Defence against attack from over the sea. This is the determining factor in shaping the whole defensive policy of the Empire, and is fully recognised by the Admiralty, who have accepted the responsibility of protecting all British territory abroad against organised invasion from the sea.&quot;5. The Army was responsible for dealing not with organised invasion from the sea, which was a purely naval responsibility, but with such raiding forces as might elude the Fleet. This responsibility included the general military defence of the United Kingdom, as well as the provision of fixed defences and garrisons at Naval bases, Imperial coaling stations and defended ports at home and abroad (other than those in the Dominions and India). The Army was also responsible for the provision of reinforcements for India in certain eventualities, for the defence of certain land frontiers and for the maintenance of an expeditionary force to meet the military needs of the Empire, wherever they might arise. This expeditionary force formed the nucleus on which were built up the huge armies employed in the Great War.6. The Royal Air Force before the war was regarded as purely ancillary to the older Services, of which it formed a part. It emerged from the Great War as a separate Service under a separate Ministry. It is essential, therefore, to the co-ordination of Imperial Defence that the responsibilities of the new Service should, be very clearly defined and correlated with those of the sister Services.The Post-War Responsibilities of the Fighting Services.7. Considerable progress had been made before the commencement of the present enquiry in the direction of defining the post-war responsibilities of the three fighting&apos; services. The enquiry by Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s Sub-Committee on the Capital Ship (March 1921), which heard much evidence as to the potentialities of the air arm&apos;at. sea, had resulted in the retention of the capital ship as the basis of our sea power. The scope of the enquiry, however, did not extend to a definition of the respective responsibilities of the Navy and Air Force in regard to operations at sea.8. The Committee of Imperial Defence had also approved an arrangement made between the War Office and Air Ministry in regard to the responsibility for anti-aircraft defence, under which the Air Force was to be responsible for the control of anti-aircraft defences, the War Office providing the necessary personnel and materiel on the ground. (C.I.D. Paper No. 365-B.) In this connection it may be mentioned that since the present enquiry began, the War Office and Air Ministry have completed a joint report on the anti-aircraft defences of the South-East of England, which has been approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence (N.D. 29), and that before the present enquiry began the Committee of Imperial Defence had arranged for the question of co-operation between the three Services in*the defence of ports, to be considered jointly by the Staffs of the three Services.9. Since the war, the Royal Air Force has been given the responsibility for the security of the mandated, territory of Iraq and Palestine.10. In addition, on the 16th March, 1.922, the following principles in regard to the co-operation of the three Services were announced in the House of Commons : &quot; (i.) That the Air Force must be autonomous in matters of administra-tion and education;&quot; (ii.) That in the case of defence against air raids, the Army and Navy must play a secondary role;&apos; (iii.) That in case of military operations by land or naval operations by sea, the Air Force should be in strict subordination to the General or Admiral in supreme command; and lastly,.&quot; (iv.) That in other cases (such as the protection of commerce, and attack on enemy harbours and inland towns) the relations between the Air Force and the: [10639] b ,2
. other Services should be regarded rather as a matter of co-operation than that of the strict subordination which is necessary when aeroplanes are acting merely as auxiliaries to other arms.&quot;   (Parliamentary Debates, March 16, 1922.)&apos; 11. In order to ascertain whether the above allocation of responsibilities between the three Services required further readjustment, the Committee felt it necessary to make investigations into the strategical basis of our system of National and Imperial Defence.12. The most important result of this part of the enquiry was to confirm the vital need for a great increase in our air forces/which had been established in previous enquiries. It soon became clear, not only that the Air Force has an important part to play in the defence of our home territory against sea-borne attack as well as of maritime communications in waters adjacent to the British Islands, but that to provide protection against aerial attack a large aerial Home Defence Force was required; The question of the size of this force formed the subject of an interim report to the Cabinet, and is dealt with in Part VI of this Report. The adoption by the Government of the Committee&apos;s recommendations on this subject added to the responsibilities of the Royal Air Force. In other respects, however, it did not bear upon the problem of co-operation and correlation between the three Services, which depends on those aspects of National and Imperial Defence where strategical or tactical co-operation between two or more services is required. The Committee therefore enquired into these questions in considerable detail.13. So far as the protection of territory and communications in the wider oceans is concerned, the question of a readjustment of responsibilities between the Service Departments did not arise. Although certain types of aeroplanes have a radius of action up to 500-600 miles, and others up to 300-400 miles, neither the British nor any other Air Service is yet equipped with aeroplanes whose normal effective radius of action exceeds about 200 miles, and beyond that distance only sea-borne aircraft have for the present to be considered. But it must be appreciated that the types of aeroplanes now in service use continue steadily to be replaced by machines of greater power and wider radius of action, Whatever the arrangements for the organisation and administration of the sea-borne Air Arm may be a subject dealt with in Part IV there is no dispute that its operations must be controlled and directed by the same authority that controls and directs the other operations of the Fleet, namely, the Admiralty. The responsibility of the Admiralty, therefore, for the protection of territory and communications in great oceans was not challenged.14. In the narrow seas, however, Imperial territory and communications are evidently liable to attack, not only by surface craft and submarines, but also by aircraft, in so far as they are within the radius of action of aircraft operating from foreign territory. The Committee therefore found it necessary to enquire how far the power of the Navy to protect territory and communications in the narrow seas is affected by modern developments of naval and aerial warfare.15. So far as territory is concerned it is satisfactory to be able to record that the three General Staffs are agreed that in existing conditions the liability of the United Kingdom to sea-borne invasion as compared with the years preceding the war is negligible.It will be recalled that in 1903 Mr. Balfour divided invasions, or attempts at invasion, into two classes : &quot; (1.) Those which are designed to strike at the heart of the Empire a blow that would either finish the war at once or so weaken our powers of resistance as seriously to imperil our chances of ultimate success.&quot; (2.) Those contrived on a- less ambitious scale, intended to distract and damage, but with no hope of inflicting a mortal wound.&quot;The first class has been referred to in previous Reports as &quot; Invasion,&quot; and the second class as &quot; Raids.&quot;Of these two kinds of attack, it was, of course, the invasion which occasioned the greatest uneasiness; and before the war (in April 1914) it was assumed that a force of 70,000 men, lightly equipped with artillery and transport, might successfully elude our fleet a number&apos;which during the war was raised to 160,000. This, therefore, was the size of the invading army against which at those dates the War Office had provide military defence.
The situation is now completely changed, and the three Staffs.are agreed that invasion is impossible; that a raid of 10,000 men is the maximum with which pur home forces could be called upon to deal; while the Air Staff are confident that the Air Force without naval aid could dispose of these raiders before our military pro-tectors were called upon to intervene. This view is not, however, shared by the General Staff of the War Office; and, without pronouncing any judgment on this question, the Committee are of opinion that 10,000 men should be adopted as the size of the raiding force to be assumed as the basis of the military Home Defence Scheme,16. Another matter on which some measure of agreement was found to exist between the Naval Staff and the Air Staff is in regard to the increased risks of merchant vessels in those portions of the narrow seas which are exposed to attack by aircraft operating from shore bases, such as the English Channel and the Mediterranean. Both Staffs admit that the advent of aircraft has increased the danger to merchant ships in such waters, though they differ as to the extent of this danger. Even the Naval Staff, who are more sanguine than the Air Staff in this matter, contemplate that in the early stages of a Avar with a Western European-Power it would be necessary to divert northabout all mercantile traffic to the East Coast until at least such time as co-operation by the Air Force can be relied on for the protection of convoys. The Naval Staff, while refusing to accept the views of the Air Staff as to the probable closing of the Western Mediterranean to British merchant shipping in the event of war with a Western European Power, admit that the necessity for diverting convoys from the Mediterranean to the Cape Route is not an impossible contingency (4th Meeting, Questions 317-321).In the view of the Committee both these contingencies, together with all implications arising out of them, should form the subject of a special enquiry by the Committee of Imperial Defence.17. Apart from this, when the Committee came to examine the question of the protection of maritime communications in the narrow seas, they did not find the same measure of agreement between the Staffs which they had met with in regard to the protection of the territory of the Mother country. On the contrary, this part of the enquiry revealed wide differences of professional opinion between the Naval Staff and the Air Staff, both in matters of principle and detail, on such questions as the power of a fleet to operate within effective striking range of hostile aircraft, the effectiveness of attacks on a fleet by aircraft and the power of a fleet to defend itself against such attacks, the defence of naval bases against aircraft attack and the protection of certain portions of our trade routes. The more closely the enquiry was pressed in matters of detail the wider these differences appeared.In the course of this enquiry frequent appeals were made to the experience of the war in support of both sides of the various controversies, and the Committee obtained independent historical evidence from the Historical Section (N.D. 19). The conditions of the late war, however, are not necessarily applicable to future wars, particularly in view of the potentialities of development in aircraft.In the light of present knowledge the Committee did not feel competent to form an opinion on the difficult technical questions on which the General Staffs take different views. They felt that, apart from the provision of an adequate Air Defence Force, which is dealt with in Part VI of this Report, the most useful service they could render at the moment was to devise machinery for securing the smooth co-opera-tion of the three services, notwithstanding the differences of professional opinion, and for gradually building up a doctrine common to the three services. This part of the terms of reference is dealt with in Part LTI of this Report. While the Committee do not put forward any suggestion to change the existing division of responsibility between the three Services as described in paragraph 10, they recommend that the responsibilities of the Navy and the Air Force in regard to the&apos;protection of commerce in the narrow seas should form the subject of further investigation. They also consider that experiment in respect of the problems of air attack and defence at sea should be given due weight in Admiralty and Air Ministry programmes, in order to secure on the basis of practical experience the fullest measure of unity of professional opinion.18. Before leaving the question of the co-operation and correlation between the three services, the Committee desire to draw attention to the views of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Harington on the subject, which were formed as the result of his experience in command of the Allied Forces of Occupation at Constantinople. These views illustrate and confirm the soundness of the principles approved by the Cabinet m March 1922 (paragraph 10).   General Harington suggests &quot;that the principle
should be j laid down that the &apos; predominant partner&apos; co-ordinates and th other Services should conform in exactly the same loyal way in which Admiral de Robeck and Brock-both officers senior to me--have helped me &quot; (N.D. 16) While the Committee are not prepared to recommend without further technical examination that this principle should be adopted in the settlement of all military problems in which more than one Service is concerned, they consider that it is worthy of the most serious consideration and should be examined by the new Committee of Chiefs of Staff referred to later in this Report (paragraph 36).Conclusions.19. The conclusions of the Committee in regard to this part of the Report mav be summed up as follows :  &quot; &quot;(a.) While the Committee do not put forward.any suggestion to change the existing division of responsibility between the three Services as described in paragraph 10, they recommend that the responsibilities of the Navy . and the Air Force in regard to the protection of commerce in the narrow seas should form the subject of further investigation. The Committee further recommend that experiment in respect of the problems of air attack and defence at sea should be given due weight in Admiralty and Air Ministry programmes, in order to secure on the basis of practical experience the fullest measure of unity of professional opinion.(b.) The principal need, as regards co-operation and correlation, is closer co-ordination, which is dealt with in Part III of this Report.(c.) The principle that in all belligerent operations in which more than one service is concerned one of the three services should be selected as a &quot;predominant partner&quot; to co-ordinate the other services should be examined by the Committee of Chiefs of Staffs.id.) While the menace of attack from the air has greatly increased and necessi-tates a strong Home Defence Air Force as proposed in Part VI of this Report, the three Staffs are agreed that in existing conditions the liability . of the country to sea-borne invasion has considerably diminished as compared with pre-war standards. As the basis of the military scheme for Home Defence, it should, be assumed that the maximum enemy force which might be landed is 10,000 men, but if, when the Home Defence scheme is being worked out by the Staffs it is considered that any change in this assumed basis is necessary, the question should be reconsidered.(e.) The effects of a possible diversion of British shipping in time of war from the Channel and Mediterranean should form the subject of a special enquiry by the Committee of Imperial Defence.Part III.-CO-ORDINATION.A Ministry of Defence.20. Since the war the most widely discussed proposal for overcoming our defects in co-ordination is a Ministry of Defence, which has been put forward repeatedly both in Parliament&apos; and in the Press. In 1922 Sir Eric Geddes&apos; Committee on National Expenditure recommended &quot; the creation of a Co-ordinating Authority or a Ministry of Defence responsible for seeing that each force plays its part and is allotted appropriate responsibility for carrying out various functions.&quot; A Cabinet Committee, which reviewed the Geddes Report, endorsed the above recommendation, but,, while admitting that the creation of a Ministry of Defence may. be the ultimate, solution of the problem, did &quot; not consider that the present time is appropriate for the fusion of the administration of the three Services under one Minister.&quot;. They recommended instead &quot;that the Committee of Imperial Defence should be in constant session all the year round in order to consider and advise on matters of policy affecting the three Fighting Services.&quot; 0\&apos;.Jne 21st March, 1922, the late Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Churchill), during a debate in the House of Commons, made an important speech in favour of a Ministry of Defence as the ultimate solution of our problems of co-ordination, though he admitted that the time for accomplishing this had not arrived. The gist is contained in the final passages :  
&quot;No solution of a harmonious or symmetrical character will be achieved in the co-ordination of the Services except through the agency of a Ministry of Defence, but- it is not possible to create such a&apos; body at the present time, nor will it be possible for a considerable time. In the interim the only steps which are open to us are to create&apos; machinery for pooling the administrative functions of the three arms and to create a common staff brain, from whose&apos; exertions in the future the responsible advice ffiven to the Cabinet of the day in regard to matters of defence must and can only effectively originate.&quot;   (N.D. 28.)21. The interim steps referred to by Mr. Churchill were the appointment of a Committee under Sir Alfred Mond, whose place was later taken by Lord Weir, to consider the Amalgamation of the Common Services! of the Navy, Army and Air Force, and later, of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence under the Minister of Education, on the question of establishing a joint Staff College for the three Services. :Lord Weir&apos;s Committee reported that &quot;the amalgamation-of the common services would only be practicable if it formed part of a comprehensive scheme of reorganisation which provided for the establishment of a Ministry to control a defence force in which the identity of the Navy, Army and Air Force had been merged.&quot; They recommended, however, a complete scheme for co-ordinating the common services, which ha.s since been adopted by the Cabinet and is being put in operation. The report of Mr. Wood&apos;s Committee, proposing a scheme for the formation of a Joint Staff College, has been circulated to this Committee and is now before the Committee of Imperial Defence.22. In view of the uncertainty as to what is meant by the term &quot; Ministry of Defence,&quot; the Committee thought it desirable to approach some of those who have advocated this solution of the problem of co-ordination, as well as other outside authorities, in order to ascertain their views on the subject. Among the outside experts who were good enough to give the Committee the benefit of their experience on this subject, there were only two advocates of a Ministry of Defence, and each of them contemplated its formation by different methods. Sir Eric Geddes (N.D.-15) proposed to achieve co-ordination of the services by the creation of a single Secretary of State for &quot;Warfare&quot; or &quot; Defence,&quot; with responsibility for the three Services. Under the Secretary of State he would put the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, each of which would be under a Sub-Minister. These Sub-Ministers should not be eligible for Cabinet rank, as that would make for departmental competition between them. Among themselves they would be equal in importance and would bear the same relation to the Secretary of State, as a Parliamentary Secretary holds to his Ministerial chief to-day. The Sub-Ministers would preside respectively at the Board of Admiralty, Army Council and Air Council, which would remain more or less as at present. The Secretary of State would have a very small office, containing a Statistical Accountant and a Council consisting of the Sub-ministers of the Navy, Army and Air Force, with two members each from the Board of Admiralty, Army Council and Air Council. The Secretary of State would have to obtain the endorsement of the Committee of Imperial Defence &quot; before his estimates and his provisions were taken to the Cabinet.&quot; Sir Eric Geddes added proposals for organisation after the outbreak of war, which it is unnecessary to enter into here.23. Major-General Sir Frederick Sykes advocated a Ministry of Defence by means of a form of fusion or amalgamation of the existing service departments. He considered that &quot; the real solution lies in definite, unified, supreme control by a Defence Ministry, with the Prime Minister as independent Chairman, and a joint Staff which would really think out defence as a whole.&quot; Failing this policy of perfection, General Sykes would &quot; support every measure which will pave the way for such control.&quot; He would achieve this by the real strengthening of the mandate and constitution of the Committee of Imperial Defence. In his view, the Committee should frame estimates for defence for the three Services, and a special section should be formed for the specific purpose of jointly framing and supervising major schemes and measures of defence. As many services as possible should be unified. Ihe personnel of the regular arms should be trained from boyhood. There should Jje a joint boy-mechanic training, a joint Cadet College, a joint Staff course, &amp;c. the question of the amalgamation of similar services should be reopened (N.D.. 35).&quot;24. The proposals of the remaining outside authorities had many points in common. They all laid stress, on the need for co-ordination. They all proposed that this co-ordination should be effected through the Committee of Imperial Defence, tney nearly all admitted, either directly or by implication, that the work of directing
the Committee was too heavy for the Prime Minister to undertake single-handed and that he should have the assistance of a Minister, as Viee-Chairman, who could give most of his time to this task. Several laid stress on the importance of securing-the co-operation of the Dominions in the Committee of Imperial Defence.25. In detail, the proposals varied considerably. Lord Midleton and Lord Haldane did not indicate any particular developments of the existing Committee of Imperial Defence, the case for which was summed up by the latter in the following-terms :  &apos;    - &quot;&quot; The Committee of Imperial Defence is an organisation that has nothing quite resembling it in any other country. The reason is that no other nation resembles the British Empire, with its Island centre for a number of countries some of which are self-governing and all of which are united by unwritten and elastic obligations. We have evolved this Committee to meet Dominion as well as Home necessities, and to meet the former it is far better adapted than any special Ministry of Defence could be. Tor on the Committee the Prime Ministers of her Dominions take places under the only leadership they are permitted by their people to acknowledge. But a still more distinctive feature of the existing organisation is that it has been evolved to meet a situation where sea power comes first and where the other two Services are, in some measure, merely its adjuncts, however great and important. That is why the scope of the Committee must be sufficiently catholic to admit of the co-operation within it of distinguished experts at the head of very different Services.&quot;   (N.D. 9.)The above extract was specifically endorsed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (15th Meeting).26. Major-General Seely, Field-Marshal Sir William Robertson, and Major-Generals Sir J. H. Davidson, M.P., and Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston, M.P., all advocated definite extensions of the Committee of Imperial Defence organisation, which resembled one another in principle while differing in detail.27. General Seely&apos;s principal proposal was &quot; that a Minister must be appointed, under whatever title be deemed expedient, whose sole duty it will be to secure the co-operation of the three Services, reporting fully to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.&apos;&apos; I suggest that he should be styled &apos; Minister of Defence and Vice-President of the Committee of Imperial Defence.&apos;&apos; General Seely strongly advocated the retention of the civilian heads of the three service departments in their existing status as members of the Cabinet. &quot; Great Government Offices,&quot; he writes &quot; cannot possibly be controlled efficiently by any man without Cabinet rank. I am sure that anyone who has had experience oi Great Government Offices would agree with this view.&quot;   (N.D. 7.)28. Field-Marshal Sir William Robertson&apos;s proposals are summarised in his Memorandum as follows : &quot; (a.) Neither a Ministry of Defence nor a combined Imperial General Staff will provide, or help to provide, the co-ordinating authority we require.&quot; (b.) Controlling authority, in its true meaning, must be vested in the supreme executive.power, the Cabinet, and it cannot be placed elsewhere.&quot; (c.) Experience has shown that we cannot conduct a great war through the medium of a Cabinet of twenty or more Ministers, and that the duty is best assigned to a small body of Ministers having no other duties to perform. As this organisation is not feasible in peace time, its place should be taken by a Council of Imperial Defence, which will form a nucleus for war.&quot; (d.) In order to furnish this Council with the professional assistance needed, there should be, working under it, a Technical Committee, charged with the investigation of all operative and administrative questions, and with presenting them, with recommendations thereon, to the Council for consideration and approval.&quot; (e.) In time of war a Minister of Supply and a Minister of Man-power should be appointed and a War Cabinet should be formed. The latter, assisted and advised by the three Chiefs of Staff, would take over the duties in (c) and (a).&quot;(/;) Every effort should be made, to enlist the co-operation of the Dominions, both as to State policy and war preparations.&quot;29. The following details of Sir William Robertson&apos;s plan may be added. The Committee would be composed very much as heretofore.   In addition : &quot; The Prime Minister would, of course, be President.   It would be the . duty of the three Chiefs of Staff to advise the Council on professional matters,
the advice to be taken.or left:as Ministers may think best, but to be heard. These officers should, as was the War Cabinet system, attend the Council in an advisory capacity and not as members. ,1 believe this procedure to be the best for both parties. Following the pre-war constitution of the Committee of Imperial Defence, a senior officer from each of the three Services should be included in the Council as members. Their experience would enable them to give valuable help both to Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, and they would be specially useful to the former in cases where the latter might feel compelled to differ from each other in regard to professional matters upon which they were called upon to advise. If these three officers.(unemployed) are not included in the Council, Ministers will have to decide for themselves professional questions about which their knowledge must necessarily be imperfect, and the soundness of their decisions will therefore remain largely a matter of chance.&quot;30. Major-General Sir J. H. Davidson, M.P., referred the Committee to an article published by him in the Army Quarterly of January, 1921, in which he advocated a plan presented to the Government by the Parliamentary Army Com-mittee in June, 1920, the essentials of which are contained in the following extract from a Minute addressed by the Committee to the Prime Minister (Mr. Lloyd George)&quot;4. It is possible that the most practicable scheme under present conditions would be to create immediately a Standing Joint Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, formed of the First Sea Lord, the C.I.G.S., and the C.A.S., or officers appointed or deputed by them, together with repre-sentatives of the Self-Governing Dominions, of India, and of other Departments concerned.&quot;5. Whatever be the Advisory Body formed, the members of the Army Committee in the House of Commons are of opinion that it is essential:  &quot; (I.) That it should meet regularly and frequently. &quot; (II.) That it should have a specially selected and permanent Secretariatto assist in its work, and to record its proceedings and conclusions. &quot; (III.) That the Chairman of this Sub-Committee should be a Minister not in charge of one of the Great Departments of State, except on those occasions when the Prime Minister is himself present.&quot;6. Among the duties of the Standing Joint Defence Sub-Committee of the C.I.D., should be included the following : 11 To examine &quot; (a.) The Imperial Organisation for Defence.&quot; (6.) The Estimates, in draft, with a view to ensuring due economy and efficiency.&quot; (c.) Our Imperial responsibilities from the point of view of Defence. &quot; (d.) The effect of scientific progress and inventions. &quot; (e.) The problems of Strategy and Logistics. &quot; (/.) The proposals of the League of Nations.&quot;31. Major-General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston, M.P., was a signatory of the Minute of the Parliamentary Army Committee referred to above, and his Memorandum might perhaps be described as a carefully thought out scheme for applying the principles propounded therein. He recommended the retention of the present Committee of Imperial Defence with the title of Council of Imperial Defence, under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, with the Lord President of the Council as Vice-Chairman. In addition he proposed the establishment of a Doard of Defence, composed of the Ministerial and professional heads of the three righting Services, with a representative of the Treasury, meeting under the Chair-manship of the Vice-Chairman of the Council of Defence, who might with advantage be called Minister of Defence. The Chairman should have power of initiative in all matters of strategy, policy, and finance affecting more than one Service. The unties proposed for this &quot;Board of Defence&quot; under its Chairman are similar in character to those suggested by the Parliamentary Army Committee for the Standing Joint Defence Sub-Committee,.but worked out in greater detail.32. An essential part of General Hunte.r-Weston&apos;s plan was that, the Council 0 Imperial Defence should function actively and regularly, and that the Dominions [10639] :-. - - &quot; -        c
and India should be represented at its meetings. He advocated that, as no one man can fulfil the functions of Chief of the General War Staff of our Defence Forces the office should be put in commission and carried out by the professional heads of the three Services sitting together in Committee. . (N.D. 13 and 13-a.)33. In the view of the Committee the proposals.for a Minister of Defence are effectually disposed of in the following passage from Lord Haldane&apos;s Memorandum: &quot;In the way of the institution of a general Minister of Defence there are obvious difficulties. If established with anything like adequate power of control such a Minister would be bound to interfere in administration, just as the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War are bound to be ready to do so, by reason&apos;of their direct responsibility for it to Parliament. The Minister of Defence would, indeed, be looked to as responsible not only for efficiency, but for economy. He would therefore require a considerable and varied staff, whose duties would overlap and duplicate those of existing departmental staffs.&apos; What would be the relation of this new staff to the staffs under the three Ministers at present responsible to Parliament, and what would be the con-stitutional and practical relationship of the new. Minister of Defence to the three older Ministers? The former would, I think, be in considerable danger of proving himself to be either too great or too little. He would be too little if the departmental staffs developed to their full inherent capacity and were working out general military policy in conference. In such a case the Prime Minister would be the only person. possessed of authority sufficient to enable him to intervene effectively.&quot; With the Cabinet behind him, he is in a position to exercise influence as no Minister of Defence could.&quot; If, indeed, the Minister of Defence were to make himself, on the other hand, very powerful by equipping himself with an effective administrative organisation sufficient for direct control of the three Services, he might well become a rival of the Prime Minister himself. The difficulty does not exhaust itself here. The first Government that made such an appointment would probably make it with great care and with sufficient regard to necessary qualifications in the occupant of the position. But if a subsequent Government came in that were not deeply interested in defence, the temptation would be strong to give the office to an influential politician distinguished, perhaps, mainly for debating gifts.&quot;  (N.D. 9.)34. To these objections may be added the following, urged by Lord Midleton :-&quot; It is surely beyond human power for one man to get his mind impregnated with the pros and cons of large changes in three totally distinct Services within the limited time for which Parliamentary Chiefs hold Office. The fact that there have been eleven changes in the Office of Secretary of State for War in the last eleven years has been very prejudicial to the economy and possibly to the efficiency of the Army. .&apos;First Lords of the Admiralty attach the greatest importance to their official tours for elucidating by contact with Naval Officers not employed at the Admiralty the problems submitted to them. The over-worked Minister of Defence would be quite unable to find time for such excursions. .&quot; A further difficulty would be the Parliamentary one, since it is often necessary for the Minister in charge to give a pledge during a debate as to the course which his Department will take. Not infrequently it has happened that by far the most efficient Head of the Defence Committee would be a Member of the  House of.Lords; . ..........................I1,t^supreme executive responsibility of all.three Departments were to be massed m one Minister it would be imperative that he should sit in the House of Commons and attendance in the House of Commons would add immeasurably to tne already multifarious duties imposed on him.&quot;   (N.D. 55.)35. The closely connected question of a combined Staff is disposed of equally effectively by Field-Marshal Sir William Robertson in the following terms :-&quot;The formation of c combined Imperial General Staff, consisting of Military, Naval and Air Force officers, working under a Chief (a soldiei, o&apos;
sailor, or airman) responsible to the Government, or to a Minister of Defence, for working out plans of operations on land, on sea, and in the air, and, according to some, endowed with &apos; fmancial and strategical powers,&apos; is even more fantastical as well: as dreadfully mischievous. An important corner-stone in military organisation is that he who makes a plan ought to be responsible for its execution and stake his reputation upon it. Consequently, the. Chief of this proposed combined Staff must draft and issue the orders of the Government to all the Generals and Admirals and Air Officers entrusted with the control of the armies, the fleets and the air forces. The&apos; confusion that would arise in the three War Departments and at the front, if any such ill-considered system as this were adopted, is quite inconceivable. Further, this Staff would&apos; directly interpose between the three Chiefs of Staff and the Cabinet, and there could be no more pernicious system than that.&quot;36. The Committee considered these criticisms to be overwhelming as against all proposals for setting up a Ministry of Defence or any Minister of Defence with authority overriding that of the Ministers at the head of the Service Departments, or a combined Staff. After careful consideration of the various proposals laid before them, after a full discussion with the Chiefs of Staffs of the three Fighting Services, and after a close examination of the constitution and the present methods of work of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Committee reached the following conclusions, which were adopted by the Government and presented to Parliament in August last (Cmd. 1938) :-&quot;(1.) It is undesirable and impracticable to supersede the Ministerial heads of the three Fighting Services by making them subordinat.es of a Minister of Defence; the alternative plan for an amalgamation of the three Service Departments is equally impracticable.&quot; (2.) On the other hand, the existing system of co-ordination by the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence is not sufficient to secure full initiative and responsibility for defence as a whole and requires to be defined and strengthened.&quot;(3.) Under the existing system the Committee of Imperial Defence, an advisory and consultative body, enquires into and makes recommendations in regard to the issues of defence policy and organisation which are brought before it. The power of initiative lies with the Government Departments and with the Prime Minister.&quot;(4.) This system, though invaluable up to.a point, does not make any authority, except the Prime Minister, who can only devote a small part of his time and attention to defence questions, directly responsible for the initiation of a consistent line of policy directing the common action of the three or any two of the three Services, taking account of the reactions of the three Services upon one another&quot; (5.) While, therefore, the existing system of departmental initiative will continue, the responsibility for the wider initiative referred to above in para-graph (4) will also rest with the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence acting under the general direction of the Committee of Imperial Defence and with the assistance of the three Chiefs of Staff.&quot; (6.) In accordance with the terms of the Treasury Minute of the 4th May, 1901, constituting the Committee of Imperial Defence in its present form, the Committee of Imperial Defence will continue to consist of the Prime Minister, as President, with such other members as, having regard to the nature of the subject to be discussed, he may from time to time summon \o assist him. In pursuance of a decision by the Prime Minister, the Committee places on record that the following should be members : &apos;&quot; The Chairman (Deputy to the Prime Minister).&quot; The Secretary of State for War.   ,&quot; The Secretary of State for Air.&quot; The First Lord of the Admiralty.   \&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer, or/the Financial Secretary. &quot; The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. &quot; The Secretary of State for the Colonies. &quot; The Secretary of State for India. / &quot; The Chiefs of Staff of the three Fighting Services.    , &quot;The Permanent Secretary of the Treasury as.head of the Civil Service.
In addition to these, other British or Dominion Ministers of the. Crown and other officials, or persons having; special qualifications, will be summoned as . members by the President according to the nature of the business. &quot;&quot; (7.) The functions of the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence . willbe  .&quot;(i.) To preside over the Committee of Imperial Defence in the absence of the Prime Minister. ,    *:&quot; (ii.) To report to the Prime Minister (when he himself has not presided) and to the Cabinet the recommendations of the Committee of . ; :    Imperial Defence.&apos;- &quot;(iii.) In matters of detail, to interpret the decisions of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet thereupon to the Departments concerned. &quot; (iv.) Assisted by the three Chiefs of Staff, as laid down in paragraph (5) . above, to keep the defence situation as a whole constantly under, review so as to ensure that defence preparations and plans and the expenditure thereupon are co-ordinated and framed to meet policy, that full information as to the changing naval, military and air situation may always be available to the Committee of &apos;&apos;, Imperial Defence and that resolutions as to the requisite actionthereupon may be submitted for its consideration.&quot;(8.) In addition to the functions of the Chiefs of Staff as advisers on questions of sea, land or air policy respectively, to their own Board or Council, ,. ;. each of the three Chiefs of Staff will have an individual and collective responsibility for advising on defence policy as a whole, the three constituting, as it were, &apos;a Super-Chief of a War Staff in Commission. In carrying out this function they will meet together for the discussion of questions which affect their joint responsibilities. ;&quot;(9.) Questions relating to co-ordination of expenditure may be entertained by the Committee, of Imperial Defence when referred to it by the Cabinet. The Committee (subject to any directions by the Cabinet) will consider such questions in the light.of the general defence policy of the Government, and of the strategical plans drawn up to give effect to that policy in time of war.&quot; (10.) The Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence will continue to act as liaison officers between the Chairman of the Committee and the Service Departments. The staff of the Committee will be strengthened by the addition - of an Assistant Secretary to be nominated, by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Air, whose status will be identical with that of the three existing Assistant Secretaries nominated by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of State for India, and the First Lord of the Admiralty.&quot; (11.) The Standing Defence Sub-Committee is suppressed, and its past proceedings will be merged into those of the Committee of Imperial Defence.&apos;&apos;The above recommendations are now in operation.The Representation of the Dominions and India.37. There is one point in the above conclusions on which the Committee, in this their final Report, would like to add a few observations, namely, regarding the provision in Conclusion (6) for the extension of invitations to representatives of the Dominions to attend as members of the Committee. From the earliest days of the Committee of Imperial Defence, representatives of the Dominions have from time to time been invited to take part &quot;in its proceedings, and the Secretary of State for India has for many years attended its meetings38. The subject of Dominion representation was discussed at the Committee in May 1911 when all the Dominions were represented. After a proposal that the Dominions should be represented by their respective high Commissioners had been rejected by the Dominions themselves, the following resolution was passed:&quot; That one or more representatives appointed by the respective Governmentsof the Dominions should be, invited to attend meetings of the Committee oiImperial Defence, when questions of naval and military defence affecting tJieOverseas Dominions are -unde^ -consideration.&apos;&apos;39. Before the War&apos;every effort1 was made to give effect,to the above resolution
Part IV. THE RELATIONS OF THE NAVY AND THE AIR FORCE.40. The question of the Relations of the.Navy and the Air Force in regard to fleet air work had already been the subject of acute and prolonged controversy, and was recognised to require investigation of a detailed character. As already mentioned, therefore, this question was referred to a special Sub-Committee composed of Lord Balfour.Lord Peel.-Lord Weir.Their Report, together with the remarks of the main Committee thereon, were adopted by the Government, and presented to Parliament last August. (Cmd. 1938.) These Reports are annexed to this report for convenience of reference.Part V.-THE RELATIONS OP THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE.41. The question of the relations of the Army and the Air Force formed the subject of an interim Report by the Chairman to the Cabinet, dated the 30th June, 1923 (N.D.-58), the effective portions of which are contained in the followingextracts :-&quot; The Secretary of State for War recently circulated to the Sub-Committee a Memorandum by the General Staff (Paper N.D. 40) on this question . . . .&quot; The views of the General Staff are contained in Part I of that Memorandum, and are summarised on p. 4 in the following terms :-   .&quot;&apos; (a.) The air units, which are an integral part of the Fleet and Air formations (including probably lighter-than-air formations) capable of co-operating with the Fleet on the high seas to be under the Admiralty.&quot;&apos;(&amp;.) The air units which are an integral part &apos;of Army formations and Air formations required to co-operate with the Army (including Air Forces allotted to the general pool for war and to home defence) to be under the War Office.&quot;&apos; (c.) Civil aviation, research, experiment and supply to be under the Air Ministry, which, relieved of all responsibility for the employment of Air Forces in peace and war, could be much reduced. -&quot; &apos; Each of the three Departments (Naval, Military and Civil) would estimate for its own air requirements, the whole being co-ordinated by the Committee of Imperial Defence before presentation to Parliament.&apos;&quot;The view of the Sub-Committee was to the effect that the above distribu-tion of responsibility was unsatisfactory and that if the Air Forces of this country were to be developed to the utmost it was necessary to retain the Royal Air Force as a separate service, and that progress would not be so great if the War Office proposals were adopted. The conclusion of the Sub-Committee was: - . ,&quot; &apos; That thev were unable to accept the views expressed by the General Staff in Part I of their Paper (N.D. 40),&apos; [10639] dby taking advantage of the presence in this country of representatives of the Dominions, to invite them, with the concurrence of their own Governments, to the meetings of the Committee and of its Sub-Committee. Since the war no such opportunities have offered, though in fact many of the meetings of the Imperial Conference, 1921, were meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence in all but name; those present included the regular members of the Committee, the subjects were mainly those which naturally fall to the Committee, and the secretarial work was supplied by the Committee in co-operation with the Colonial Office, the Dominions and India. Moreover, both before and since the war the Dominions and India have been furnished with many of the Reports of the Committee&apos; of Imperial Defence.
&quot;The Secretary of State for War asked that his dissent from this conclusion might be recorded.&quot;.The Cabinet adopted the above Report on the 9th July and confirmed the present arrangement under which the Royal Air Force is administered by the Air Ministry as a separate Department of State.Part VI. THE STRENGTH OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.42. The last item in the Terms of Reference is the standard to be aimed at for defining the strength of the Air Force for purposes of Home and Imperial Defence.43. This question was dealt with in an Interim Report, dated the 12th June 1923 (N.D. 46), in the following terms :-&quot; In view of the menacing position already revealed by their investigations, the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Co-operation and Correlation between the Navy, Army and Air Force deem it necessary, &apos; without waiting for the completion of their enquiry, to present an Interim Report on Item (C) of their Terms of Reference, namely :-&quot; &apos;The standard to be aimed at for defining the strength of the Air Force for purposes of Home and Imperial Defence.&apos;&quot;The Menace.&quot;(2.) In this Paper attention is drawn to France only, because at the present moment she is the strongest Air Power. France possesses at the present time a total of about 1,200 first-line aeroplanes, of which 232 are stationed overseas and 946 in France. Of the latter, about 600 are organised as an Independent Air Force, capable of being used to attack this country. In a war between Great Britain and France these 600 machines might, in certain eventualities, be reinforced from the squadrons allotted to the Army, and the Air Ministry estimate that a total of 866 machines might be utilised for the purpose of attacking the British Isles, unless France was simultaneously engaged or menaced on some other front.&apos;&apos; Against this, after meeting the needs of the Navy, we have fifty-two first-line machines available for Home Defence (of which only twenty-four are at this moment in these Islands), together with-twenty-four machines, attached to the Army. Fifteen additional squadrons, with a total eventual strength of 172 additional machines, are in process of formation, but under present arrangements will not be completed before 1925.&quot; (3.) The French Government contemplate an increase in their Air Forces, which will bring them up to a strength of 2,180 first-line machines, of which 1,868 will be in France and 312 overseas. The evidence is still uncertain whether this programme will be carried out, but, in any event, some years must elapse before it oan be completed,&quot; (4.) The menace to Great Britain, and more especially to London, by the existing disparity between the Air Forces of France and Great Britain was described in the following extract from a Memorandum submitted to the late Government by Lord Balfpur on the 29th May, 1922 :- .&quot;&apos;If we had to depend solely on anti-aircraft guns and other land defences, the French Air Force at their present strength, or, to be precise, at the strength they would possess after a rapid mobilisation, would enable them to drop on London a continuous torrent of high explosives at the rate of 75 tons a day for an indefinite period. When it is remembered that in the worst German raid only 3 tons were dropped on London, and that every raid was separated from its successor by a considerable interval of time, the overwhelming seriousness of the situation thus revealed must be obvious to all. Day after day, and night after night, the capital of the Empire wou d be subject to an unremitting bombardment of a kind which no city effectively acting as the Military, Naval and Administrative centre of ^ountry engaged in a life-and-death struggle has ever had to endure. The War Office and the Admiralty would be paralysed by the destruction of the material instruments which are necessary for the conduct of their, business.fflaHHBR
Lines of communication would be cut, and London would be uninhabitable-  probably in fact, certainly in the opinion of those who now dwell there.&quot; &apos;I say nothing about the arsenals, dockyards and defended harbours, nor about the shipping crowded in the Port of London, for the details of the picture which I have just outlined are easily filled in.&apos;&quot; Such was the situation in May 1922. It is now slightly worse. According to the latest calculations of the Air Ministry, the French could, unless opposed bv an adequate Air Force, drop 168 tons of bombs on England during the first twenty-four hours, 126 tons during the second twenty-four hours and 84 tons for each succeeding twenty-four hours, for an indefinite period. That is to say, the weight of bombs that could now be dropped on London in a single day is almost as great as the total weight of bombs that was dropped in England during the whole war. .&quot; (5.) Of the 232 machines possessed by France overseas, 180 are stationed in North Africa. . In time of war these must constitute a source of positive menace, both to Gibraltar and to the movements of British shipping in and out of the Mediterranean.&quot;In these circumstances, in a war with France it might be necessary to divert for a time the bulk of our shipping from the Mediterranean to the Cape route.       , &apos;   i        -&quot; (6.) The military consequences of such a situation are sufficiently obvious. The diplomatic disadvantages, if allowed to continue, must be very serious.&quot;(7.) The Committee consider the matter so urgent, and the necessity of taking prompt steps to remedy the situation so essential, as to warrant them in immediately submitting the following recommendations : &quot;1. In addition to meeting the essential, Air power requirements of the Navy, Army, Indian and overseas commitments (in regard to which a Report will be furnished later)/ British.Air power must include a Home Defence Air Force of sufficient strength adequately to protect us against Air attack by the strongest Air Force within: striking distance of this country. &quot;2. That the Air Staff be instructed to draw up detailed proposals for the creation of such a Home Defence Force, to be organised, in part, on a ,   regular and permanent military basis, and, in part, on a volunteer or reserve basis, but so arranged as to ensure that sufficient strength will be immediately available for purposes of defence.  The fullest &apos; possible use to be made of civilian labour and facilities. &quot;3. That the first stage of the Air Ministry&apos;s scheme, which will absorb our entire capacity for aerial expansion in the immediate future, should provide for a strength of 600 first-line machines, that is to say, a number of machines equal to the Independent Striking Force of the strongest Air Force within striking distance of this country.&quot;The details of this stage should be arranged with a view to the possibility of subsequent expansion, but before any further develop-ment is put in hand the question should be re-examined in the light of the then Air strength of foreign Powers.&quot;44. The above interim Report was accompanied by the following additional Note by the Chairman, also dated the 12th June, 1923 (N.D. 47) ^   -&quot; I am directed by the Sub-Committee to communicate the following resolution to the Cabinet :-11&apos; The Sub-Committee consider that, consequent on the approval of the Cabinet to the interim report, immediate expenditure will be required under the following principal heads if the scheme of expansion is to be economically and expeditiously initiated : &quot; &apos; Purchase of land for aerodromes. &quot; 1 Additional research &quot; &apos; Increase in recruiting machinery. &quot; &quot;Immediate increases in officers and other ranks. 1 Increases in Air Ministry Staff.The Committee, recommend that the. Treasury should be approached with a view to this preliminary expenditure in the course of the present financial year, which, the Committee areinformed, should not exceed  1,000,000.&apos; &quot; [10639]   . d 2
45. The above Eeports were approved by the Cabinet on the 20th June, 1923, and the following announcement of the Governments policy based thereon was made in both Houses of Parliament on the same date :-&quot; The Government have come to the following conclusions with reference to British Air power : ;&quot; In addition to meeting the essential Air power requirements of the Navy, Army, Indian and Overseas commitments, British Air power must include a Home Defence Air Force of sufficient strength adequately to protect us against Air attack by the strongest Air Force within striking distance of this country.&quot; It should be organised in part on a regular and permanent military basis, and in part on a territorial or reserve basis, but so arranged as to ensure that sufficient strength will be immediately available for purposes of defence. The fullest possible use to be made of civilian labour and facilities.&quot; In the first instance, the Home Defence Force should consist of 52 squadrons to be created with as little delay as possible, and the Secretary of State for Air has been instructed forthwith to take the preliminary steps for . carrying this decision into effect. The result of this proposal will be to add 34 squadrons to the authorised strength of the Royal Air Force. The details of the organisation will be arranged with a view to the possibility of subsequent expansion, but before any further development is put in hand the question should be re-examined in the light of the then air strength.of foreign Powers.&quot; In conformity with our obligation under the Covenant of the League of Nations, . His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladly co-operate with other Governments in limiting the strength of air armaments on lines similar to the Treaty of Washington in the case of the Navy, and any such arrangements, it is needless to say, would govern the policy of air expansion set out in this statement.&quot;   (Parliamentary Debates, June 26, 1923.)46. In connection with the question of the Air Force required for Home Defence it is necessary to mention that in the course of the evidence of the Chief of the Air Staff it was made clear that, whatever may be the strength of our air forces, we must anticipate a series of very formidable bombing attacks on London, the capital city of the Empire and seat of government, and other places in the South of England, at any rate during the early stages of a war with a Power on the other side of the Channel. In proportion as our mobile air forces are adequate and efficient, the consequences should be less grave than those depicted by Lord Balfour in the passage quoted above in paragraph 4 of the Interim Report (see above, paragraph 43), since Lord Balfour assumed dependence solely on anti-aircraft guns and other land defences. Nevertheless, the Committee do not wish to underrate.the seriousness of the situation with which the country would be confronted in such an eventuality, and they think it probable that,the Government of the day might be gravely hampered and embarrassed in the conduct of the war. They are of opinion that this contingency and its various implications should be kept constantly under review by the Committee of Imperial Defence.47. In order to arrive at the total standard of strength for the Royal Air Force, it is necessary to add to the forces for Home Defence the strength of  Royal Air Force Units serving with the Navy. The Air forces required for co-operation with the Army, The Air forces to be maintained by the Air Ministry, to fulfil their responsibilities in Iraq and Palestine.48. It is not possible at. the present time to make a recommendation as to the ultimate standard to be aimed at for any of the Services mentioned m paragraph 47. As.regards the Royal Air Force Units serving with the Navy, the ultimate strength in war will be determined in the main by the number of first line aeroplanes which can be carried by the Fleet, that is to say, by carriers, battleships and light cruisers (N.D. 6th Meeting, Q. 401-2). The carriers are not yet all completed, and the Admiralty, in August 1922, considered that, having regard to the financial stringency and the present state of air development in other Navies, they would not be justified in asking for machines on board battleships (N.D. 6th Meeting, Q.8). In these circumstances&quot;, the eventual figures for the Fleet Air Arm cannot at present be given.
49. As regards the air forces for co-operation with the Army, the Secretary of State for Air has given an assurance to the Secretary of State for War that any requirements will be fully satisfied, subject to Treasury approval. The actual figures require further detailed discussion between the Chiefs of the General Staffs. This consultation was held up pending the decision on the relations of the Army and the Air Force. The Committee recommend .that these discussions should be pushed forward as rapidly as possible by the Chiefs of Staff under the new procedure proposed in Part III.50. Similarly, the ultimate establishment of the Air Forces abroad involves many uncertain factors, such as the future of Iraq and Palestine, and the number of machines eventually to be provided for Singapore.51. The Committee are not concerned in the number of squadrons&apos; in India, which are paid for by India and are a matter of negotiation between the Government of India, the India Office and the Air Ministry. The subject, however, has recently been fully explored by the Committee on Indian Military Requirements.52. In the above circumstances,. the Committee can only record their recom-mendation that there must be sufficient air strength for the Navy, the Army&apos;, the Overseas Garrisons and Home Defence. The squadrons and machines authorised up to the 1st April, 1924, exclusive of Home Defence, are as follows : United Kingdom- Machines.(a.) Naval co-operation  ,  .Ci.) For embarkation in carriers in all waters(13 flights).......        ...        ...     78(ii.) Flying Boats (1 flight)     ... ... ...       5(&amp;.) Army co-operation (2 squadrons) .... ... ....   24 .(c.) Reserve.(3 squadrons)    ... ...        ...        ...     36Mediterranean-Seaplanes (1 flight) ...        ... ... ... ...       6(Aircraft for embarkation in carriers shown under United Kingdom above.)Egypt (3 squadrons)      ...         ... ... ... &apos; ...      34Palestine and Transjordania (1^ squadrons) ... ...      16Aden (1 flight) ...        ...        ... ... ... ...       4Iraq (8 squadrons)       ...         ... ... ... ...      92Total     :..        ...        ...     295India (6 squadrons)      ... ... ... ...    &apos;    ...      72Grand Total of machines     ...        ...        ;..     367Note. Armv co-operation machines are not&apos; differentiated except in the United Kingdom. ,The Dominions.53. The Air Forces of the Dominions are, of course, a. matter for the Govern-mentsof the Dominions themselves. The Air Ministry have prepared Memoranda ror the Imperial Conference, 1923, on the subject of Air Co-operation with the dominions (C.I.D. Papers 206-C to 210-G), which have received the approval of the Ummittee of Imperial Defence.Airships. - *&apos; &quot;  &apos; &apos;-&apos;&apos;\I. A- question which is closely related to the main enquiry is that of airships, &quot;Hen had been referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence before the-&apos;anTntmr?t ^ ^S Committee. At the first meeting this question was remitted to Ai&apos; M&apos;er&quot; P&apos;artmental Committee composed of representatives of the Admiralty, and ry m&amp; Treasury, which was set up on the initiative of the Air Ministry, of t]W&apos;n aS^6(^ to rePort direct to the Committee of Imperial Defence. The policy in a ^?7ernment on this question was announced in Parliament on the 26th July 1,1 the following terms:- .1 t    ^e question of the development of airships has recently been considered y the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Imperial Shipping Committee.
The Committee of Imperial Defence attaches considerable strategic value to airships, whilst the Imperial Shipping Committee considers that it is by means of an airship service that the carriage of mails can most cheaply be expedited to the Far East and Australia.- &quot;The Government have, therefore, decided to resume the development of airships, and to proceed, if possible, by means Of a commercial service rather than by State operation.&quot; Proposals have been placed before them by the Hon. and gallant Member , for Uxbridge (Lieutenant-Commander Buruey), under which a bi-weekly service of six large airships to India will eventually be set up. The Government have accepted the scheme in principle, subject to the details of the contract beino-satisfactorily settled by the Treasury. The House of Commons will have an opportunity of considering the scheme when the details have been provisionally agreed. .      . &apos;       -   ;&quot; The Dominions are being informed of this decision, and it is hoped to discuss the question at the Imperial Conference with a view to their co-operation in the scheme.&quot; The administration of the scheme in so far as it is a matter of commercial aviation will come under the Air Ministry.&quot;Part VII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.55. The conclusions and recommendations of this Report may be summarised as follows : Co-operation and Correlation of the Services (paragraph 19).(a.) While the Committee do not put forward any suggestion to change the existing division of responsibility between the three Services as described! in paragraph 10, they recommend that the responsibilities of the Navy and the Air Force in regard to. the.protection of commerce in the narrow seas should form the subject of further investigation. TEe Committee further recommend that experiment in respect of the problems of air attack and defence at sea should be given due weight in Admiralty and Air Ministry programmes, in order to secure on the basis of practical experience the fullest measure of unity of professional opinion.(b.) The principal need as regards co-operation and correlation is closer co-ordination, which is dealt with in Part III of this Report.(c.) The principle that in all belligerent operations in which more than one . Service is concerned, one of the three Services should be selected as a &quot;predominant partner&quot; to co-ordinate the other Services should be examined by the Committee of Chiefs of Staffs.(d.) While the menace of attack from the air has greatly increased, and necessitates a strong Home Defence Air Force, as proposed in Part VI of this Report, the three Staffs are agreed that in existing conditions the liability of the country to sea-borne invasion, has considerably diminished as compared with pre-war standards.&apos; As the basis of the military scheme for Home Defence, it should be assumed that the maximum enemy force which might be landed is 10,000 men, but if, when the Home Defence scheme is being worked&apos;out by the Staffs,, it is considered that any changein this assumed basis is necessary, the question should be reconsidered.Co-ordination of the Services (paragraph 36)., (e.) It is undesirable and impracticable to supersede the Ministerial heads of the three Fighting Services by making &quot;them subordinates of a Minister of Defence; the alternative plan for an amalgamation of the agriculture* Service Departments is equally impracticable. (/.) On the other hand, the existing system of co-ordination by the Committee of Imperial Defence is not sufficient to secure full initiative ana responsibility for defence as a whole and requires to be defined ana(g.) Under the existing system the Committee [of Imperial Defence, an advisory and consultative body, enquires into and makes recommendations &quot; regard to the issues of defence policy and organisation which are brouB
before it. The power of initiative. lies with the Government Depart-ments and with the Prime Minister.(A.) This system, though invaluable up to a point, does not make any authority, except the Prime Minister,, who can only devote a small part of his time and attention to defence questions, directly responsible for the initiation of a consistent line of policy directing the common action of the three or any two of the three Services, taking account of the reactions of the three Servkes upon one another.(i.) While, therefore, the existing system of departmental initiative will continue, the responsibility for the wider initiative referred to above in paragraph (h) will also rest with the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence acting under the general direction of the Committee of Imperial Defence and with the assistance of the three Chiefs of Staff.(j.) In accordance with- the terms of the Treasury Minute of the 4th May, 1904, constituting the Committee of Imperial Defence in its present form, the Committee of Imperial Defence will continue to consist of the Prime Minister, as President, with such -other members as, having regard to the nature of the subject to be discussed, he may from time to time summon to assist him. In pursuance of a decision by the Prime Minister, the Committee places on record that the following should be members: The Chairman (Deputy to the Prime Minister). The Secretary of State for War. The Secretary of State for Air. The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the Financial Secretary. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Secretary of State for India. The Chiefs of Staff of the three Fighting Services. The Permanent Secretary of the Treasury as head of the Civil Service.In addition to these, other British or Dominion Ministers of the Crown and other officials, or persons having special qualifications, will be summoned as members by the President according to the nature of the business.(k.) The functions of the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence will be (i.) To preside over the Committee of Imperial Defence in the absenceof the Prime Minister, (ii.) To report to the Prime Minister (when he himself has not presided) and to the Cabinet the recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence.(iii.) In matters of detail, to interpret the decisions of the Prime Ministerand the Cabinet thereupon to the Departments concerned, (iv.) Assisted by the three Chiefs of Staff, as laid down in paragraph (i) above, tokeep the defence situation as a whole constantly under review so as to ensure that defence preparations and plans and the expenditure thereupon are co-ordinated and framed to meet policy, that full information as to the changing naval, military and air situation may always be available to the Committee of Imperial Defence and that resolutions as to the requisite action thereupon may be submitted for its consideration. &apos;$) In addition to the functions of the Chiefs of Staff as advisers on questions of sea, land or air policy respectively, to their own Board or Council, each of the three Chiefs of Staff will have an individual and collective responsibility for advising on defence policy as a whole, the three con-stituting, as it were, a Super-Chief of a War Staff in Commission.   In carrying out this function they will meet together for the discussion of questions which affect their joint responsibilities, (w.) Questions relating to co-ordination of expenditure may be entertained by the Committee of Imperial Defence when referred to it by the Cabinet. The Committee (subject to any directions by the Cabinet) will consider such questions in the light of the general defence policy of the Govern-
ment, and of the strategical plans drawn up to give effect to that polio? in time of war. -    &apos;(n.) The Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence will continue to act-as liaison officers between- the Chairman of the Committee and the Service Departments. The staff of the Committee will be strengthened by the addition of an Assistant Secretary to be nominated by the Prime Minister oh the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Air, whose status will be identical with that of the three existing Assistant Secretaries nominated by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of State for India and the First Lord of the Admiralty.(o.) The Standing Defence Sub-Committee is suppressed, and its past pro-ceedings will be merged into those of the Committee of Imperial defence the Relations of the Navy and the Air Force (paragraph 40). (p.) See Annex.The Relations of the Army and the Air Force (paragraph 41). (q.) No change in the existing relations is recommended.The Strength of the Royal Air Force (paragraphs 42 to 52).(r.) The standard of strength of the- Royal Air Force is the sum of the I following: The Home Defence Air Force. The Royal Air Force Units serving with the Navy. The Air Forces required for co-operation with the Army. The Air Forces maintained by the Royal Air Force to fulfil their I responsibilities in Iraq and Palestine.The figures, excluding those for the Home Defence Air Force, so far as they can j at present be arrived at, are given in paragraph 52.(s.) The Air Forces required for co-operation with the Army should be worke out as soon as possible (paragraph 49).Proposed Further Investigation by the Committee of Imperial Defence.(t.) The effects of a possible diversion of British shipping in time of war from! the Channel and Mediterranean should form the subject of a special j enquiry by the Committee of Imperial Defence (paragraph 16).(u.) The Committee of Imperial Defence should keep constantly under review] what measures of preparation (if any), apart from anti-aircraft defence,! are required in view of the exposed situation of the capital and seat oil government and other parts of Southern England to aircraft attack in I certain eventualities (paragraph 46).(Signed)        SALISBURY (Chairman).NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.

N.D. 65.ANNEXURE.Memorandum covering the Report of the Special Sub-Committee on the Relations of the Navy and the Air Force.THE Main Committee observe that the Special Sub-Committee are not altogether satisfied with the term &quot; Seconded &quot; which they have used in describing, the status of Naval officers serving in the Fleet Air Arm. It is clear that the actual position of a Naval officer seconded to the Air Service afloat differs from a seconded officer as hitherto understood-. For example, he continues to be under the ultimate tactical and disciplinary orders at sea of an officer of the Service to which he permanently belongs, whilst he is serving under the immediate command of an officer of the Service to which he is temporarily attached. Moreover, the work he is called on to do in his temporary Service directly relates to the needs of his parent Service, and he carries it out under the eyes of a commanding officer of his parent Service. The Main Committee therefore consider the term &quot;Seconded&quot; not altogether appropriate. They would prefer the more general term &quot;Attached,&quot; provided the conditions of attachment necessary in this particular case are clearly understood, as follows: These Naval officers belonging to the Fleet Air Arm are therefore to be attached to the Air Service. But whilst after their training under the Air Service they will be posted to units of the Navy by the Air Service on the nomination of the Admiralty and will serve under the immediate command of Air Service officers, yet afloat they will be under the ultimate command of the Naval officers of the Fleet. Though their temporary pay and their acting rank will be determined by the Air Service, after consultation with the Admiralty, yet their permanent rank and promotion will continue to be subject to the regulations of the Navy. Lastly, though they must serve with the Air Service and not be moved from it during the period of their attachment without the consent of the Air Ministry, yet as regards discipline and status afloat they will in all respects be in precisely the same position as officers of the Royal Marines.With regard to uniform, the officers and men generally of the Fleet Air Arm will wear a distinguishing badge on their uniform, if the Admiralty desire, the Naval officers attached to the Fleet Air Arm will retain their Naval uniform with the same badge.If any Naval other ranks and ratings are employed in the Fleet Air Arm, the same principle as regards uniform and badges would apply.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 27, 1923. :        &quot;......     .[10639]E
N.D.60.(AhoN.D. (B) 20.Report : Sub-Committee on Relations between the Navy and the Air Force.Contents.Part   I. The General Problem ... ... ... ... part II. The Present System    ... ... ... .... part III. Recommendations       ... ... ... ... 4PART I. The General Problem.,1. YOUR Sub-Committee were instructed to enquire iuto the relations of the Navy and the Air Force as regards the control of Fleet air work, and on this point they have taken a great deal of evidence from witnesses representing both Departments.In addition to this, two of our members, Lord Peel and Lord Weir, accompanied by Sir Maurice Hankey (Secretary), paid a visit to the aerodromes in the neighbourhood of Portsmouth and the Aircraft Carriers &quot; Argus&quot; and &quot;Eagle.&quot;2. In the course of the somewhat acute controversy between the two Departments, a very large number of points have been raised whose importance is subsidiary and illustrative. This was inevitable, and probably desirable; but the broad principles lying at the root of the policies respectively advocated by the contending parties are perfectly intelligible, quite apart from the detailed arguments and counter arguments by which they are supported.3. To the Air Ministry was given in 1917 control over the air forces of the country. The Department was at one stroke placed on a par with the Admiralty and the War Office, for, though aerial warfare is a growth of yesterday, it was felt that its rapidly increasing importance required an organisation which would ensure its development under the most favourable conditions. In these circumstances it was only natural that the Air Ministry should strongly object to being partially dismembered so soon after it had been brought into existence, the more so as in the early days of this dispute the severance of the Fleet Air.Arm from the rest of the Air Force meant an immensely larger proportionate loss than it would mean at the present moment. But though the injury involved in the complete removal from their jurisdiction of the Fleet Air Arm is relatively diminished, it remains in principle the same, and if carried out to its logical conclusions would, in the opinion of the Department, lead to many administrative difficulties and much overlapping, while in the region of supply and research it would hamper progress and increase expense.&apos;r10G39] F
4. The Admiralty case is not less worthy of most serious consideration. In their -view a Fleet Air Arm is now as necessary to a Fleet as cruisers, destroyers or submarines. Aerial reconnaissance and. aerial &quot;spotting&quot; are as strictly naval operations as gunnery, torpedo work and wireless telegraphy. It seems to them intolerable that, while they are responsible for the safety and success of our Battle Fleets, the air work on which that safety and that success in large measure depend should be performed by persons belonging to another Service, imbued by different traditions, and looking for support and promotion to a different Department.5. Your Sub-Committee have the greatest sympathy with both these points of view, and they have given much anxious thought to the question of how they oan best be dealt with. They do not think that the present system can remain altogether unchanged; neither do they think it possible to sever completely the Air organisation which does work for the Fleet from the Air organisation which is responsible for Home Defence against air attack and for co-operating with the Army in other theatres of operation. A course somewhere between these two extremes is the,one we recommend but before describing our suggestions in detail it seems desirable to give a brief sketch of the system now in course of development along the line where the two Services come into &quot;contact.PART II. The Present System.The General System6. The general system is that the Air Ministry raises, trains and maintains the Fleet Air Arm, At sea the Fleet Air Arm comes under the operational and disciplinary control of the Admiralty, which designs, builds and maintains the carriers.The functions of the Fleet Air Arm comprise aerial reconnaissance, naval gunnery, spotting, bombing and fighting.The Fleet Air Arm operates at sea from a carrier, which is a floating aerodrome. In addition, in time of war, capital ships and cruisers will embark aeroplanes, but at present the risk to personnel and materiel is too great to justify this in time of peace.Air Force squadrons also operate over sea from shore bases in co-operation with the Navy, but these are not at present in question.The numbers of the Royal Air Force personnel at present employed with the Fleet Air Arm are 115 officers and 681 other ranks.Policy7. Naval-Air policy is concerted by the Air Staff and Admiralty War Staff. Initiative may come from either side, but Naval officers of high rank do not, under the present system, have many opportunities of obtaining experience or training in air matters, to fit them for this work.The Coastal Area8. Apart from matters of policy, liaison is secured between the Navy and the Air Force by a special machinery termed the &quot; Coastal Area&quot; Organisation. This is provided by the Air Ministry for the purpose of. administering the Fleet Air Arm on land, subject to the general control of the Air Ministry. The Coastal Area is com-manded by a senior Air Force Officer (the present occupant is an ex-naval officer) who is responsible for the maintenance at full strength of the personnel and materiel of the Fleet Air Arm, and for its special training for naval purposes. He is the adviser to the Admiralty on Air matters other than policy, and communicates directly with the Com-mander-in-Ohief, Atlantic Fleet, on all matters connected with the Fleefs requirements.9. Under the Air Officer Commanding the Coastal Area are two Group Captams, with headquarters at Leuchars - (the Forth) and Lee-on-Solent respectively. In the case of larger operations involving the embarkation of aircraft or the carrying out oi operations from shore bases, the Naval Commander-in-Chief notifies his requirements direct to the Air Officer Commanding Coastal Area. For minor operations he deals directly with one or other of the Group Captains.10. Corresponding arrangements are made at Malta for the Mediterranean Fleet.
Position on Board Carriers11. As soon as the Air Units are on board the carriers they come under the orders of the naval Commander-in-Chief, and are altogether outside the control of the Coastal \ Area Organisation, which is then, as we have already.noted, only responsible for keeping units up to strength in air personnel and materiel. The orders for flying are given by the naval Commander-in-Chief (who has &quot;to Air Force Officer on his Staff) to the captain of the Aircraft Carrier, who is, of course, a naval officer, and he gives his orders to the senior Air Force Officer on board. The Royal Air Force personnel are responsible for the cleanliness and maintenance of their own quarters and some other parts of the ship, such as the aeroplane deck. They can be employed on the general duties of the ship. Difficulties have, however, been made in regard to the performance of particular duties, such as the training and use of Air Force personnel for passing ammunition to the guns.12. A certain.amount of co-operation is practised between the skilled mechanics of both Services. The Royal Air Force may, for example, utilise the services of the ship&apos;s blacksmith for certain repairs to aeroplane engines, and the Royal Air Force may undertake repairs to motor-boat engines. Such co-operation is naturally limited by the highly specialised training which is inevitable in each Service.Supply of Personnel13. The Air Ministry are responsible for the supply of officers and other ranks for duty with the Fleet Air Arm, with the exception of certain naval officers, who, after training in Air Force establishments, are employed as observers in &quot; spotting &quot; machines and some naval ratings employed as wireless telegraph operators.14. It is of importance to note that the Royal Air Force possesses a number of officers who were formerly in the Royal Naval Air Service, many of whom were trained as naval officers. The senior positions in the Fleet Air Arm are at present largely filled by these officers. The original intention of the Air Ministry was that, in order to replace these, some 30 per cent, of the officers of the Fleet Air Arm should consist of naval officers seconded for a term of years. Unfortunately, however, only a very few naval officers responded to the invitation to volunteer for this service.15. Itmay be worth noting that the general system for the supply of Air Force officers to meet future demands is divided into two classes : (a.) Officers holding permanent Commissions, and(b.) Officers holding short-service Commissions.     &apos;       -16. Officers holding permanent Commissions, on leaving Cranwell, are given the choice of the particular branch in which they wish to specialise. Those selecting the Naval side will, in the first instance, do four years with the Fleet Air Arm. They may then serve with other branches, including courses of instruction, for a term of years in order to gain wider experience, hut will ultimately return to the Naval side again. This practice will ensure that there will always, be a proportion of senior offic?rs in the Royal Air Force with Naval experience obtained in the Fleet Air Arm.17. A proportion of the officers holding short-service Commissions for five years,&apos; after receiving their initial training of one year, are posted for duty with the Fleet Air Arm, and do the whole of their service with that branch.   On completion of their five years&apos; service they are posted to the Reserve for five years, when they are earmarked as reserves for the Fleet Air Arm in case of emergency.18. The Air Ministry endeavour to retain the personnel with the Fleet Air Units for the normal term of service (i.e., four years), but exceptional cases arise when it is impossible to allow them to remain for the whole&apos;of that period.Training19. The whole of the primary training of flying personnel, whether their future work is to be on sea or on land, is carried, out by the Air Ministry.   No criticisms of it have been brought to our notice, and we do not propose to refer to it again.   The later and more specialised training of the Fleet Air Arm is partly conducted in the [L0639J &quot; &apos;   - i2
carriers and partly on land at technical schools maintained by the Air Ministry at certain naval ports. Apart from their initial training, before they are embarked, the Air Detachments of Carriers use these establishments for training, when riot required by the Naval Commander-in-Chief for exercises. .It.will be seen therefore that as things are at present these establishments are used entirely for the purposes of the Fleet Air Arm or for shore-based aircraft co-operating with the Navy. The Air Force training schools in the Portsmouth area work in close touch with. the naval gunnery and torpedo schools. Behind the establishments devoted exclusively to training for the Fleet Air Arm are a series of technical centres maintained for the Air Force as a whole, the resources of which are available for the Fleet Air Arm.Design and Research Work20. New design, experimental and research work to meet naval requirements are carried out by the Air Ministry after consultation with the Admiralty. The Admiralty, after consultation between the two Departments, put forward their suggestions as to the types of machines which they require, and the Air Ministry design such machines, as far as is practicable from the point of view of aerodynamics and similar technical consideration. The Air Ministry draw up the specification of the type required, and call for designs from the trade, and the Admiralty are kept fully informed of the progress made during the whole process and after the trials have been carried out.21. The Navy are not directly represented on the design, experimental or research branches at the Air Ministry, but the Air Ministry utilise the services of a certain number of ex-Naval officers, who have now transferred to the Air Force, in these depart-ments, and also receive reports as to defects in design and performance of machines from Air Force officers serving with Fleet Air Units, thus ensuring that due weight is attached to the user&apos;s point of view in the modification and improvement of design.22. There is also in existence an Inter-Departmental Committee called &quot; The Joint &quot; Technical Committee on Aviation Arrangements in His Majesty&apos;s Ships,&quot; which consists of representatives of the Admiralty and the Air Ministry. Its functions are to examine the technical problems which may arise with regard to the suitability of the types of aircraft intended for embarkation on board carriers, and the modifications and improve-ments which can be effected on board the carriers themselves. It is clear from the evidence that new uses of aircraft involving possibly new types can be proposed either by the Admiralty or the Air Ministry, and that the latter give full consideration to all suggestions which may be put forward by the Navy.The Supply of Materiel23. At present the Air Ministry are solely responsible for the supply of all materiel connected with aircraft. An establishment of the machines required for the Fleet Air Arm has been agreed upon between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, and the latter is responsible for maintaining that establishment at full strength with its correct proportion of machines in reserve, the necessary spare parts and the various shore organisations required for its maintenance. This establishment is at present limited by the number of Aircraft Carriers in commission in the Navy, but the Air Ministry have made the necessary arrangements in their programme of construction to increase the number of machines up to the number which will be required when the two new Aircraft Carriers are completed in 1 923-24.PART III. Recommendations.24. We have endeavoured to explain, in the first place, the general nature of the objection felt by the Air Department to any important change in the existing system, and by the Admiralty to its maintenance. We have also given a full account of the system as it has been developed up to the present moment. We now propose to turn to the future and make certain suggestions which, as we hope, may go far to reconcile the contending parties and to make material improvements in the existing system.25. Our task is materially lightened by the fact that, in the course of discussions before your Sub-Committee, a larger measure of agreement was found possible on certain aspects of the problem than had at one time seemed likely. I
26. In the first place, it appeared that on some important points the practice, though not the written law, of the Air Department was already in conformity with the wishes of the Admiralty.   For example, the Admiralty are very desirous that the. i Group Captains in contact with the Navy, should be officers with experience of the Fleet Air Arm.   ., ^   .Broadly speaking, the Air Ministry take the same view, and we recommend that lstReoom-it be made part of the settled practice of the Air Ministry to consult with the men atum&quot; Admiralty before such appointments are made.   We think the same principle should be extended to the Air Officer Commanding the Coast Defence Area and the Senior Air Officer on board a carrier.27. The Admiralty desire that the Air Ministry shall provide all the materiel which they demand. This, we believe, has always been the intention of the Air Ministry. .      .^We think it should be formally laid down, and that, in the event of the Air 2nd Besom. Ministrv for one reason or another not carrying into effect the wishes of the Admiralty, n&quot;&quot;uu there shall be an appeal by either party to the Committee of Imperial Defence.3rd recommendation-mendation.28. We have no reason to believe that there is any fundamental difference of opinion between the two Services with regard to certain questions of discipline, such, for example, as those which might arise when a member of the Air Force leaves the ship, where he is under the command, for every purpose, of the Captain, and goes for training to the aerodrome, which is under the control of an officer of the Air Force.But though there are no differences of principle, there are certain obscurities which it would be desirable to clear up, and we therefore recommend that the two Departments should, in collaboration, draw up a code of regulations which would make clear the relations between them at all points where they come in contact.29. In all the cases that we have so far enumerated there may have been misunderstanding, but there has not been at any time, so far as we are aware, any difference of principle.30. We now turn to a class of cases where, as a result of discussion before your Sub-Committee, the Air Department have shown a disposition to meet Admiralty views. The first of these relates to the framing of the Naval Estimates. The Admiralty desire that, in these Estimates should be included the cost of the Fleet Air Arm.The Air  Department are of opinion that  technically this course would  be mendation&quot; inconvenient, but have no objection to it in principle.   Your Sub-Committee are of opinion that this question should be settled by the Treasury in consultation with the two Fighting Services.3i. The Admiralty require that the Air Force on board ship should be completely under the orders of its Captain. Your Sub-Committee are of opinion that; inasmuch as all the airmen on board ship are under the Naval Discipline Act, this, in theory, is already provided for, but undoubtedly in the minds.of those chiefly concerned some obscurity hangs over the subject. This, we think, should be explicitly cleared up. * -The position of a member of the Air Force when on board ship does not differ in ^J^jj&quot;&quot;&quot; law, and should not differ in practice, from the position of, say, a Marine.6th Recom-mendation.32. In order fully to carry out the policy laid down in the preceding paragraph, we recommend, and have reason to believe that the Air Ministry will accept the principle, that all reports on officers of the Fleet Air Arm, whether confidential or otherwise, should be signed by the Captain of the ship and passed through the Naval Commander-in-chief to the Air Officer Commanding the Coastal Area.33. A further point which should be dealt with under this heading is one on ^endaaon&quot; which the Admiralty have expressed considerable anxiety and on which we have reason to believe that the Air Force are prepared to meet their wishes. The Admiralty are apprehensive lest, in time of war or other emergency, the Air Ministry might withdraw from the Navy units of the Fleet Air Arm, and use, them for other purposes. In respect of this we recommend that it should be definitely laid down that the personnel, materiel and reserves of the Fleet Air Arm should not be withdrawn by the Air -Ministry without either the consent of the Admiralty or a decision of the Cabinet.
8th recommendation-mendation.34. Before concluding this class of questions we must take note of a complaint made by the Admiralty that on board the Carrier there is a good deal of duplication of effort between the purely Naval Service and the Air Force.     &apos;We think this subject should be looked into by the two Departments concerned, and we do not doubt that&apos; arrangements can be made by which all overlapping can be effectively avoided.9th. recommendation-mendation35. We now come to the last class of questions with which we have to deal, which are at once the most difficult and the most important.   We are strongly of opinion, and have every hope that the two Services share our view, that, since in warweServices may have to co-operate, itthete, it is vital: that in time of peace they should form an accurate estimate of each others needs and capacities.We therefore recommend;(i.) That Naval officers should be appointed to the Air Staff.(ii.) That Air Force officers should be appointed to the Naval War Staff, (iii.) That some means should be devised by which the wealth of technical knowledge at the disposal of the Admiralty should be utilised in the technical departments of the Air Ministry, preferably by reinforcement of the staff of these departments by naval technicians.36. These recommendations refer exclusively to the headquarters of th e two Services; but it is perhaps even more important that the junior ranks of the two Services, who will in time occupy responsible positions, should have a considerable sprinkling of persons familiar with the needs and capacities of the other Service.10th recommendation-mendation.37. The Air Force look to a system of naval seconding for carrying out half this policy, and we cannot believe that the Admiralty would be averse to having members o( the Air Force on board the carriers. Unfortunately, seconding from the Navy to the Air Force, as at present understood, must be deemed to have been hitherto a failure, and we find it difficult to believe that, if the present system remains unchanged and unexplained, any great improvement is likely to occur. We cannot be surprised.that a young officer who has just joined the Navy is reluctant to abandon, even tempo-temporarily, the department under which he expected co serve and to exchange it for one which is essentially different.   The feeling is natural, and cannot be ignored.It must, however, he pointed out that if the word &quot; seconding &quot; is thus used this is not what any naval officer under the present scheme is expected to do. In ordinary practice, when we say that an officer is &quot; seconded&quot; to another Service we no doubt intend to express the idea that for the duties which he had to&apos; perform and for the authorities he had to obey in the Service which he has temporarily left, will be substituted new duties and new authorities. But this does not really represent the facts in the case of so-called &quot; seconding&quot; from the Navy into the Air Force. The duties of the seconded officer, though carried out in the air, remain, nevertheless, Naval duties, and the Captain whom he has to obey continues to be a Naval Captain.In order to make this situation perfectly clear, we recommend that no seconded Naval Officer shall be asked to perform non-naval air duties, except with the consent of the Admiralty.   We believe the Air Force are prepared to accept this principle.llth Kecom-; mendation.38. If this recommendation be carried into effect, the most important change involved in the operation of what is (somewhat inaccurately) called &quot; seconding&quot; is the change from the Naval to a Flying uniform a change which can hardly be said to touch the essence of the situation.We suggest, however, in order to meet the sentimental, though not on-that account unimportant objection, that the uniform of a Naval flying man who, except for his period of training, is to all intents and purposes still under the Admiralty, should be distinguished from the flying men under the Air Force by some differentiating badge or, mark. This would be the outward and visible sign that he still remains a member of the Service which he originally joined. It would be a clear indication that what he proposes to do is to add accomplishments in Naval flying to the other accomplishments which his brother officers are cultivating. If such a plan were found practicable, the objection felt by the Admiralty to the introduction of what they deem an alien element into the domestic life of the ship should be largely mitigated.
39. It might well be that, if this scheme succeeded, the number of officers seconded from the Navy to the Air Force would exceed the 30 per cent, of the total contemplated by the Air Service.We see no reason why 30 per cent, should be regarded as the maximum, and we 6hould propose to leave it to the Admiralty to determine what the proportion should be, subject to the proviso that not less than 30 per cent, of Air Force Officers, whether regular or short service, should serve on board the Carriers.40. There is another point of great practical importance on which something must be said. It is agreed that the work of spotting for naval gunnery is one which should be undertaken in all cases by Naval officers, but such investigations as we. have been able to make convince us that naval spotting and fleet reconnaissance cannot be sharply divided, and that the officer entrusted with the one may inevitably find himself called upon to perform the other also. We have been unable to discover any objection to this change, which, on the face of it, seems obviously reasonable.We therefore recommend that fleet reconnaissance, as well as naval spotting, istt fiecom-should be entrusted to naval officers seconded or otherwise. mend&amp;tion.41. If anybody will take the trouble to read the evidence given before us they will, we believe, be impressed by the number of problems for which a solution has been found by the two Departments or suggested in this Report. We earnestly trust that no merely technical difficulties will be allowed to stand in the way of a settlement which in the public interest is most urgently required.(Signed)      BALFOUR (Chairman).
