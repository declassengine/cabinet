(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS 3RITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT),B I TS 38 T.84463 (23).THE POSITION AS REGARDS THE SUPERANNUATION 0.&apos;F SCHOOL TEACHERS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.(1)   In 1918 an Act was passed providing pensions for school teachers in England and Wales,     The Scheme was a most liberal one, and the whole Oost was to be borne by the public Exohequer.     The measure was framed and carried through without actuarial advice, and therefore without any clear understanding either of the extent of the benefits that were being conferred upon the teachers or of the&apos; magnitude of the burden which would ultimately fall upon the Treasury.     Nor does any consideration appear to have been given to the Scottish position.    A contribu-tory Scheme had been established in 1912 in Scotland upon a proper actuarial basis, and had proved a complete success from the point of view of all concerned.     When England and Wales provided non-contributory pensions for their teachers, Scotland had to follow suit, and abandon its contributory system.(2)   The resulting drain upon the Exchequer would have been heavy enough in any case, for it now appears that the benefits conferred by the Act - entirely, be it noted, at the cost of the taxpayer -   mere actuarially equivalent to an average of not less than Z6% on the salary of every teacher in service on the day the new Scheme came into operation.     Serious as this would have been without any further developments, the situation was greatly aggravated as the result of the introduction of the BUrnham Scales. These raised the salaries of teachers to two and a half times their pre-war level.     While the existence of a non-contributory Superannuation Scheme may have been presentin/
in some vague way to the minds of those responsible for settling the new order of things, it is &quot;beyond doubt that, once again, no attempt was made to look at the matter from an actuarial point of vies.     It does not seem to have been realised that,  so far as pensions were concerned, the Burnham Scales were being made retrospective over a period of forty years.     The Government Actuary calculates that the combined effect of the Superannuation Act of 1918 and the Burnham Scales was to give every teacher over 50 years of age more - in the case of women teachers considerabljr more - than 300$ of his average pre-war salary.     As the entire cost of Superannuation fell upon the Exchequer, by far the larger part of this abnormal increase came from the pockets of the taxpayer.(3)    The Geddes Committee examined the system estab-lishcd by the Act of 1918 very critically, and recommended &quot;that a full enquiry should be held with a view to placing the Superannuation of Teachers on a sound contributory basis, under which the teachers and the authorities who employ them would each bear a due proportion of the burden&quot;. They further recommended that, pending this enquiry, a 5% levy should be paid by the teachers.     In 1922, a Bill imposing a 5% levy was introduced&apos;and passed.     Its operation was, however,  limited to two years - by the end of which time the Government anticipated that the enquiry would be concluded,, and the way clear for the setting up of a permanent Scheme On the lines which the Geddes Com-mittee had suggested,     A Departmental Committee was forthwith appointed to go into the whole subject, and, in the meantime, the teachers&apos;  contributions have been used as/
as an appropriation in aid, although they are, in certain circumstances, returnable and although, it is certain that a considerable proportion of the money will ultimately be reclaimed.(4)   The Departmental Committee was presided over by Lord Emmott, and included inter alios the Government Actuary, and representatives of the Treasury, the Board of Education and the Scottish Education Department.     The Report, which is absolutely unanimous in regard to the whole financial structure of the Scheme, has&apos;now been received1.     As the Act of 1922 expires in June, 1924, an immediate decision as to the attitude of the Government seems imperative.     There are three alternatives:-(a)   to gat aside the Committees Report and take no action whatever;    (b)   to acoept the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations and take immediate steps to give them legis-lativo effect;    (c)   to announce that the Government have accepted the Committee&apos;s recommendations, that it %&amp;-their intention to have them embodied, in a Statute at the earliest possible moment, and that, in the meantime, the Act of 1922 will be renewed as an emergency measure,(5)   It is difficult to imagine any argument that could be brought forward in favour of the first of these courses.     It is inconceivable that the Government should ignore the recommendations of the Geddes Committee and of the ve*y oarefully selected Departmental Committee which was subsequently set up to investigate the y/hole subject, to say nothing of the Iosb which would be involved by the dropping of the 5% contribution from the teachers.     It is not merely a case of acquiescing in the present situationand/
and&apos;&apos;cutting the-loss&apos;.     The Committee&apos;s Report shows very clearly that the demand on the Exchequer will increase by leaps and bounds.   If there is a reversion to the pre-1922 position, the annual cost may be expected to rise from two or three millions to nine or ten.(6)   By far the most desirable course would be to legislate immediately.     ThiB is obviously what the Com-mittee anticipate will be done.     They emphasise the convenience of bringing the old system to an end at the close of the current financial year.     So far as Scotland is concerned, all the indications point to a measure of the kind being non-conteniouo.     Tho Education-Authorities will oertalnly not oppose, and the teachers have passed and forwarded a strong resolution in favour of immediate action on the part of the Government.     In England and Wales, which have had no experience of a properly articulated contributory Scheme, difficulties are pretty certain to be raised from the side of some at least of tho Local Education Authorities.     The more fully the matter is diBoussad, the more likely Is it that these objections will melt away, particularly if they were met - as they might possibly be - by small concessions which did not affect any point of principle. No official declaration of policy has yet been made by the English teacherB, but it would not be surprising if they felt compelled, fir the sake of consistency, to resume their&apos;attitude of 1922 and press for the reBtora-tion of non-contributory conditions.     That, however, is a phase of opposition that would have little force -perhaps even little reality * behind it.     In&apos; any case, tho Committee1s Report supplies abundant argument for convincing Parliament of the unsoundnees of any such claim.CO/       &apos;
(7)   Should the difficulties in the way of immediate legislation prove insuperable, it may be necessary to fall back upon the third alternative, although it is undoubtedly beset with serious risks.     The longer an unsatisfactory system is allowed to persist, the more difficult it becomes to amend it, and the heavier the weight of &apos;back service;&apos; which the Exchequer will be forced to assume.    Moreover, the continued use for current expenditure of monies upon which there is a contingent liability of refund is a financial expedient which ought to be dispensed with at the earliest possible momentj it means piling up obligations which may prove highly inconvenient in the immediate future.     No doubt the alternative now under discussion would be the easiest for the moment.   , The Local Education Authorities would have no interest in opposing it actively;   so long as the status quo is maintained, they do not need to concern themselves.     It is even conceivable that the English teachers might acquiesce.     If they did so, however, it should be regarded as a danger signal.     It would mean that they were determined to get rid of the contribution altogether at no distant date.    As the Committee point out, the one safeguard for the Exchequer is for Parliament to establish a permanent system.     As they also point out, if the teachers and the Local Authorities could look at the matter, broadly, they would, see that it was the one safeguard for them too..(8)   To sum up, the second alternative *- immediate action on the lines of the Report - seems to be on every ground preferable, assuming&apos; that it can be carried through--.-If/
If it be necessary to choose the third alternative, then it ought to be made plain that the moratorium will be of the briefest possible character.     In-the interval, no opportunity should be lost of drawing attention to the Report of the Committee.     The more widely it iw read, the stronger the volume of public opinion in its favour is likely tc be.(9)   A final word as to the urgency of a decision. The Burnham Committee is to meet again shortly, and it -is practically certain that the outcome of its delibera-- tions will necessitate a reconsideration of Balary scales in Scotland also,     Neither in England nor in Scotland will it be possible to reach any proper understanding, unless the future policy of the Government with regard to Super-annuation has been quite clearly and unmistakably defined,(Sgd.)
