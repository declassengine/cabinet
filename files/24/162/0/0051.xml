/Eli3&apos;pOCfflOT MAJESTY&apos;3 GOYERl.mm. Gow No- :CP, 451 (23). CAB I N E TAGRICULTURAL POLICY.Note by the&apos; Secretary for Scotland on the proposals contained (a) in the letter from the National Fanners&apos; Onions of England and 3d6tland dated tho 25th October, 1923, and (b) in the Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of the 31st October and the Memoranda by Sir Francis Floud of the.30th and 31st October, 1923. .1.    The proposals advanced by the Farmers&apos; Unions are (a) an annual subsidy of  2 per acre on all arable land subject to maintenance of existing arable and to the payment of a minimum wage to agricultural workers, or (b)&quot;a subsidy of  1 per acre on&quot;all arable land without the maintenance of cultivation provision but with the minimum wage condition,2,    Assuming that the policy of subsidy is to be accented. I think that  2 per acre is excessive, and that  1 with the condition as to maintenance of cultivation as well as to wages is the ^nost that should be offered. This in Scotland would cost about  3,000,000 per annum,3.&apos;   There may be difficulty in arriving at a . satisfactory definition of arable land and pressure will be brought to bear upon the Government ig? secure somehow that the subsidy is hot absorbed in increased rents or soiling prices, and that some part of the benefit reaches the agricultural labourer.    I do not think that the fixing of a flat rate minimum wage is a practicable method of securing the latter object in view of the very diverse wage conditions in different parts of the country, In short, a policy of subsidies must&apos;inevitably evoke a demand for rent and wage control, and probably for cultivation control also - which I think would nave to be opposed,4.    I a..i inclined to think that as compared with a subsidy on arable acreage there are advantages in action along the lines suggested by Sir Francis Floud in. his Memorandum of 31st &quot;October,* subject, however, to the inclusion of oats as well as wheat.from the point of view of agricultural employ-ment, wages, and general national prosperity, it is juat as important to continue oat growing as wheat growing, and, while it is true that,&apos; in comparison with pre-war prices, the present price of oats is somewhat higher than the present price of wheat, this is an argument for a lesser subsidy only and in no way justifies no subsidy at.all.    Moreover, an agricultural policy which gave large subsidies to the industry in England and practically&quot; nothing to the industry in Scotland, would be impossible to defend.
5.    Taking the average yield at 4 quarters to the acre for wheat, and 5 quarters lor oata, a subsidy of 60/- /per acre for whnat would bring the price roughly&apos;to 50% above re-war prices, and the corresponding subsidy for oats would a about  2 per acre,    I fear, however, that the cost would be prohibitive, and I would suggest thai half these amounts is the maximum that should be offered.6,    I.agree to the principle of a sliding scale of subsidy as proposed by Sir Francis Ploud.7.    The difficulties as regards rents, wages, and control of cultivation would, of course, confront us under a cereal subsidy just as under an arable-acreage subsidy.WAR.&apos;9.11,23.Scottish Office, Whitehall, S,w\ 1.
