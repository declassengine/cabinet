FBIERDLY The Committee had before them a letter -dated 16thSOCIETIESQUESTIONS.November 1923, addressed to the- Prime Minister by. theNational Conference of Friendly Societies asking him to receive a deputation on -(a) The removal of thrift penalties on &quot;Old Age Pensions&quot;;(b) The remuneration of Panel Doctors from National &apos; Health Insurance Funds;      . .The fulfilment of the pledge given during the passageef the Industrial Assurance Bill to increase theamounts which under Section 62 of the Friendly.Societies Act 1898 can legally be incurred or paid on the death, of children under 10.The Committee agreedTo recommend the Prime minister 1) that if possible he should accede to the request of the Friendly Societies for an interview;(2) that the replies to the ab&amp;ve questions should be on the following lines(a) The Societies should be referred&apos; to the following extract from the Prime Minister&apos;s Election Address;-&quot;The solution of the unemployment problem is the key to every necessary social reform. But I should like to repeat my conviction that we should aim at the re-organisation of our various schemes of insurance against old age, ill health, and unemployment,    More particularly should we devote our attention to investigating the possibilities ox getting rid of the inconsistencies and the discou-ragement of thrift at present associated with the&apos;working-of the Old Age Pensions Act, The encouragement of thrift and independence must be the underlying&apos;principle of&apos; all our social reforms.&quot;(b) the Societies should be referred to the Minister of Health.(c) the Societies should be informed that a Bill to give effect to the pledge in question has been prepared and that but for the dissolution Its passage into law in the late Session would have bean&apos; secured.

Dear Sir, 

          Since our letter to you of November 5th on the subject of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, the situation has been completely altered by the General Election, and I am therefore desired by the Committee of the Six Point Group to approach you with the request that you will receive a Deputation from this Organisation on this subject and on the other points in our programme, which are:-

1. Amelioration of the Law in the matter of Child Assault.

2. Pensions for windows with young children.

3. Adequate legal and financial protection for the children of unmarried parents.

4. Equal Guardianship of Infants.

5. Equal Pay for Men and Women Teachers.

6. Equal opportunities for men and women in the Civil Service.



Women have been waiting for years for some Government to put these questions forward, and the absence of any attempt to deal with them will place any Party at a disadvantage with large numbers of the Electorate. Very many women voters have no tradition of party ties to bind them and the tendency to watch for the cost social programme before coming to a decision as to voting is notably on the increase.

With this in mind we ask you to enable us to assure our members that the Unionist Party is prepared to deal adequately with these questions if re-elected to power.





                                                                         Yours faithfully,

Sir,



    At your request, on Friday, July 27th, the Home Secretary, the Rt.Hon.W.C.Bridgeman, M.P., received a deputation from the Women&apos;s Freedom League to put before him our views, which he promised to convey to you, on the desirability of putting women, in the matter of the franchise, on the same footing as men; and the failure of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act to remove all barriers to the employment of married women. We now ask you, in view of the coming General Election, if you will make a public pronouncement in regard to these two matters, which we consider to be of first-class importance to the interests of the women of this Country. We should be glad to know whether, if you are returned to power, you will pledge yourself to secure,

(1) that women shall have equal political Voting rights with men - that is, women and men who have attained the age of twenty-one shall be entitled to the Parliamentary Vote on a short residential qualification?

(2) the enforcement of the provisions of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, so that marriage shall be no reason, excuse or justification for the Dismissal of women from the Civil Service, from work under local Governing bodies, or from private Employment?





Awaiting the courtesy of your reply to the above,



                                I am, Sir,

                                  Yours faithfully,

You -will no doubt remember that the Coalition Government-., in 1918 promised to remove all existing inequalities in the law between men and women.   The- liberal and labour Parties put similar pledges on their programmes in 1922, and will doubtless do so again.   Mr. Ben&amp;r Law also in 1922 declared himself in favour of Equal Franchise, Equal Divorce, and. certain other points for which we are working.Tho reforms for which tho women&apos;s Organisations v/ho desire to ts1 represented on the Deputation require a place on the Unionist Party:s programme are:-1)   Equal Franchise, a memorial in favour of which hasbeen signed by &quot;250 Members if your, present Parliament;^)   Equal Guardlanshjp Rights jfar^ Mothers, and Fathers. You are -aware &quot;that1 your &quot;uevernuerit Has set up this session, as did the &quot;last Government, last, session, a&quot; Joint Select Committee of both Houses of Parliament - to deal with the Guardianship of Infants Bill, and on both occasions the coming of a General Election has prevented the issue of a Report.    The demand for this reform by women rotors&apos;has been growing greater and greater during the last year.3]   Pensions for Widows with Dependent Children.,  This reTbrm, The need for wElcii was recognisec. by the Unionist party in the resolution passed at the last National Unionist Association Conference at Plymouth, will- we earnestly hope, find a place also on your Programme.These reforms have behind them the support of millions of women voters, and we much hope that you will be able to accede to our request.   We can promise to lay these -and certain other points before you in half an hour, and we therefore earnestly hope that in spite of the heavy calls on your time, this Deputation may he received.Yours faithfully,vSigned) ELEANOR &apos;g.

QQ?Y OP LETTER FROM IADY,,A,STOR, M.P,4, St, James&apos; Square, ,    S.iv.1. 15th November, 192S.Dear Sif Reginald/I feel that it is extremely difficult for UnionistCandidates to go before the elector^ without some knowledge ofwhat line the Government propose to take on certain questions that are usually called worsen&apos;s questions,     Educated and professional women, especially the teaching profe&amp;sion, dofeel that many Of these mast be applied as teat questions tooarty candidates, not as mere matters of sex equality, but because In their view they ape closely bound up with funda-mentai moral questions.     I think the moat Important questions on which   a clear lead is needed ere the following:*li        The Government attitude towards the Sill for the Guardianship and Maintenance of Chlldreh, on which a sort of deadlock has arisen.     Working women feel strongly I find cn this matter, for organisations like the Co-operative $omsnf3 Guild etc. have discussed It and talked it out for sometime,2,        The Government attitude towards granting women the vote at the same age as men and on the same conditions.     Many teachers over 30 in my own constituency for instance are disfranchised because they live in rooms, or with an old parent ?;ht;m they support, and many cf these are Conservative in oo!itic3.5.        The Government attitude towards the unanimous opinion of organised women and of the Home Office official report that the problem, of the streets can ,only be solved by the employment of women police.4,        The Government attitude toward Sidews&apos; Pensions,Liberal and Labour oandidates have a very great advantage over Unionists in these directions, and it would help uaenormously to have seme encouragement that these non-partyquestions will have at least as much a nlace in the Unionistprogramme as in the programme of the ether parties.Yours sincerely,(Signed)   liancy Astor,

home office &quot; &apos; whitehall.s.w.(D9th november 19ss.dear gbwer,with reference to the enolosad letter from the six point group, i think the only question the home office oan deal with is the&apos;question of the employment of women police in the metropolitan area.     on this subject the home secretary in reply to the deputation aaid - &quot;it does not, require strong arguments to- convince me - for 1 am convinced already - of ths value of the work of women police.     at the present moment it is purely a question of expanse, and so far as i am concerned, i should be vary glad if there -were more money available to spend in that direction&quot;.&quot;i i ii think ths prime minister might say that he has been in consultation with the home secretary but fears he can add nothing to what was said by ths home seoretary to the deputation. at the present moment the financial situation ia euuh that the government &amp;o not fasl able to   increase the number fixed by the previous home secretary.     they recognise, however, the value of the women pol lea and it is because of the paramount * .. importance of avoiding additional expenditure at the present time that they have regretfully come to&quot;this decision.points 1 and 3 - that the government, should secure equality of treatment for men and women ;!,n the civil service and that the government should cease to diemig? $omen on marriage - are matters falling, within the purview of the treasury and not of the homo office.     i send you herewith the letter and enclosures which i received from the trcaaury when the home secretary was about to receive the deputation.point 4 - that the   government should refuse any further, money grant to cambridge until it haa set its house in order.     this is not a matter for the home office, but probable the prime minister would agree with the reply
given by the home secretary to the deputation.     the general effect of thib reply was that any change at cambridge in the matter gf degrees for women should be brought about by persuasion and net by outcide pressure.     to refuse a money grant to cambridge on this ground- would be an inter-ference with their power of managing their own affairs, such as vvcttld be hard to justify.    as you will remember, the question was      debated last session on the urdvs rsities billi as to poirfc   5 -- the right of peeresses to ait in the house of lords - this again is not t. matter for the home office, but i see that in replying to the deputation the home secretary said - &quot;that is a matter for the lord chancellor&apos;c department and i will convey vvha-t has been 3aid to him&quot;.,     i cannot r erne mis r now whether i ever sent a copy oi&quot; the notes of the deputation to the lord chancellor.     i ruthor think i did not -and i have kept .:no copy.     2iy copies sere sent to you on the 13th august.     perhajp it-would bo north while to send to the lord chancellor!s private secretary a copy of the remarks made by the deputation on this subject and of the home secretary&apos;s reply, but i presume that whatever view the prime minister may have on the merits of this question, his answer will be that a change would require legislation and it is not possible at present to give any promise to add to the government1a legislative programme.loure sincerely,(signed)     a.ma1twell.b.p.U.cower Esq., c,B, , c.v.o.,
Copy. 0X,X9-%%QKM^i.M&apos;--...^. Bg^grJLa^fl^nrt Dear Madam,I thank you for your letter of November 3rd in whioh on behalf of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship you welcome my announcement on women1s questions made in my recent speech at Drury lane.    In that speech I defined my general attitude;   hut you invite me to make a mere definite and explicit statement on a large number of political, legal, and administrative measures of special interest to your Society.    It is impossible for me at the moment to give yeu categorical answers on each .of the points of your questionnaire but I touch on two or throe of the major Issues raised by you.I have been a consistent supporter of women5s suffrage; and even at the time the Franchise Bill of 1918 was passed&apos;I felt that the discrimination in age between men and women could not be permanent-!    I think so still. At the same time I recognise that there is a strong national feeling that the Government should not attempt to make changes of a highly controversial character.   Tbo -complete equalisation of the franchise is up.Qbubte.dly a constitutional issue of far-reaching importance^   And, therefore, I feel that I should not be justified in giving an undertaking that this will be carried into effect by the Government in the coming Parliament, if it should give rise to acute controversy.The question of making the existing grounds for Divorce the same for men as for women appears to me to be a matter of right and wrong and I am in favour of equality in this respect.
"Equal pay for equal work" is a highly ambiguous formula capable of very diverse interpretations. I am in sympathy with the ideal which it expresses; but it can only be usefully applied in practice when allowance is made for certain fundamental natural differences of the sexes. A claim that in all cases the pay of men and women should be identical would, as has been realised in practice, have the deplorable result of throwing many women out of employment.

I think it is essential that women should be employed in connection with Police work in all those matters in which their knowledge and experience render them suitable. The complete re-establishment of women police in London shall be carefully considered and the final decision must be governed by the principle of how best to secure the maintenance of law and order and the prevention of crime.



                                              Yours truly,

                                            (Signed) A. BONAR LAW.

AHEAD Eg II..Treasury Draft Reply to Questionnaire onnoxod to letter dated 14th Bo v. 1923 from Association of fomen Glories and. See rot arias.,General questions:I agree in principle that offices generally should conform to certain standards of health and comfort, particularly in regard to such matters as sanitation, over-crowding and precautions against fire     j am not sure how far the Public Health Authorities are already -empowered to deal with abuses of this kind, but if the existing lew is not&apos; sufficient I should be prepared to support legislation to confer tho requisite powers, [ft comment . Tho reference is no doun-t to Mr. William Graham&apos;sFITj  &quot;Offices Regulation Bill, 1923&quot;, (Bill 196),ift reply Whilst I should deprecate any a., tons ion of- Government control over wages, I should bo in favour of- . -   any practicable arrangement for securing adequate remuneration in industry generally.The provision o :&apos; arbitration machinery for tho Civil Sortiea has, I understand, boon approved in principle by the late Government and I endorse their docisi on.aft Comment. The Writing -Assistants&apos; case to which thoAssociation .refer has been under discussion by a Special Committee of the Civil iorrioo notional whit.ley Council. -Vriting- Assistants are employe   on quasi mechanical outies such as punching, tabulating, casting, indexing, etc. and their rates of pay run fom 38/6 (if 18 or over) to 62/&apos;7d* a weOiC-.   The Association have claimed for those woomoa very substantial increases, including an overriding minimum wage of 55/- a Werek - a claim which the Official Side are quite unable to roconoilo with generally accepted     .
standard of remuneration.The principle of.....arhltration-waa-accoptod-hy &apos;Mr. Baldwin whan Chancellor of the IS choquor in Mr.Bonar la^s Ministry, and, a Committee composed of Treasury and Staff representatives is now working out a schono.It is not stated what is meant by resattle-msnt hut if, as is probable, this includes Government grants .r provision   far training, it would not be possible to restrict such a concession to women clerks.    A vast number of women had their normal occupations interrupted by war servico, but the same is true of a largo :art of the adult malo population whether thoy served in tho Forces or at home.    To give training or resettlement grants in all these oases would throw an immense burdon on the taxpayers of this country and greatly hinder the recovery of trade and employment.   Hitherto subject to certain excoptions Government assistance of this character has been limited to young men whoso education or apprenticeship was interrupted by the war and to those whose war disabilities have proveulod their return to their old occupation and in view of the present financial position of the country and the serious unemployment I could not support such an ezten-sion of Government assistance&apos; as is suggested.   In any case the practical difficulties of establishing and administering a scheme of this kind at this late date would, be almost insuparablo.(Civil Service)&quot;As regards substitution I recognise the claims of ex-servica men as paramount and I stand by the second Interim Report of lord Southborough&apos;s Committee.
With, this reservation, I agree that women should bo given full opportunity of shewing their value in State employ-ment; that Civil Service grading should be determined according to the nature of the duties to be performed; that Civil Service typists and shorthand typists should receive sa good terms of remuneration as are&apos; normally given to their colleagues in commercial life&apos;; and that the position of Women in tho Civil Service should be governed by tho Resolutions passed in the House of Commons-on 5th August 1921.&quot; Commant This amounts to a claim that temporary adultwomen-: clerks who arc efficient and dependent on their earnings&apos;have a right to continue in State aaployracnt. This claim is incompatible with the preference to ex-service men which is the settled policy of the Govern-ment and has only recently boon unanimously endorsed by the 2nd Interim Report of the Southborough Committee oi. which wore two women representatives:.   A &quot;right&quot; to State employment is in any case inadmissible, and tho word &quot;effioionb&quot; begs- the whole question.     As a mat tar of fact temporary women employees have had chances of qualifying for establishment on favourable terms *oi,- as the Financial Secretary tola Major Bamett in the- House of Commons on the 15th instant, it is not right to afford a general preference over candidates who have been successful at the appropriate competitions to women who have not been successful,The question of hours of duty in the clerical and kindred classes must bo decided on merits and cannot solely be governed by the interests of temporary women clerks at present employed.
J (J oThe vast majority o,f Government employees  ; alroady work at least an 8 hour day, but the normal hours of tho permanent clerical, Writing Assistant and Typing classes in London headquarter Offices are only 7 a day inclusive of mealtimes.   Sheso hours word criticised as too short by the Select Committoo on Estimates and again recently by the Anderson Committee. It is understood that the official side of tho national &quot;Thitley Council have invited a discussion of the whole question oil the National Council.Jt- Comment fe STThe assumption that Writing Assistants (wages 38^61. - if 18 or over - to 62/?d* a week) are pa-.U as such instead of as Clerical Officers because they aro women is groundless.    The work of Writing assistants is definitely inferior to that of the Clerical Class, as was agreed both by staff end official representatives.*$t Comment&quot;The Association&apos;s question assumes- that the organisation of routine duties proceeds on identical linos in Government Offices and ,in commercial life. As a matter of fact the won: of Government is on a much larger scale and the classification of duties is carried somewhat further than is- nocassary as a general rule in outside -employment.   There are no doubt several commercial conoarns whero women designated as Claris are employed tor part of their time on typing or short a-- nd typing and for the rest of their time on simple routine duties.    The correct inference is thought to toe that in outside employment typing is rated as of about the same value and shorthand typing as of/somawnat
what greater value than the simple quasl-neohanical duties incidental to office routine- duties which would in the Civil Service be assigned not to Clerical Officers but to Wviting Assistants, whose scale is lower than that of Shorthand typists but nevertheless compares sell with that of persons engaged on similar work in coimtierciol life.The present scheme of classification Is one agreed between official and staff representatives in 1920, If the staff elements desire to obliterate the distinction between the typing (and shorthandtyping) classes and the Clerical Class, no doubt they will submit their proposals through the Whit ley Channel, but such a revision would.necessitate a drastic review of the Clerical Class seals*which is framed to cover superior work, its maximum being for man  370 a year and for women   80 inclusive of bonus.     It is, however, extremely unlikely that the mere&apos;intelligent staff side leaders would associate themselves with any such proposal;.     Indeed Miss haguire uses her position as President of the A .W.C.3, to ventilate views whioh she could rot express as Women&apos;s Secretary of the Civil Service Clerical Association, Oppment &quot;Equal treatment&quot;.for men and women in thecommon classes of the Civil Service is already the agreed policy (save as regards scales of salary) under tho Report of the Reorganisation Committee and the House of Commons Resolutions of 5th August, 1921,     Tho application, of the principle causes putri controversy, ad it is not possible to secure an Identity of conditions for men and women nor can women&apos;s claim to an&quot;eoual share of higher posts immediately fructify owing to the/claims
claims of existing personnel&apos; and of ex-service men. In other words, the throwing open of the general classes to&apos;women cannot create vacancies and the suggestion that it should &quot;be followed immediately by the conversion to women&apos;s posts of a number of posts now filled by men i3 unconscionable.
