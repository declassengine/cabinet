HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.wSECrfeT 104(23),memorandum by the Mj.fir-ter of Labour. Draft Convention on the use of White Lead.With referenoe to the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum CP. 394/23, recommending the ratification of the Geneva Convention concerning the use of white lead In painting, I do not, generally speaking, dissent from the Memorandum. But I think it is necessary to emphasise the exact circumstances and conditions on which the British Government Delegates voted for the Convention at Geneva in 1921:   that vote in support of the Draft Convention was given only if, and so far as, It represented an agreed compromise.On behalf of the British Government Delegation, of which I was then the Senior Member, I made the following declaration when I and my colleague recorded our votes in favour of the draft Convention:. . . ,&quot;If any contentious issues arise, or if any difficulty arises, as to the compromise, it must be understood that the vote 13 on the basis of an agreed compromise and in order to avoid the wishes of the Conference noi being carried out, owing to a technical point.On that basis the vote of the British Q^)vernmerrt-^ Will be declared in favour of the Convention&quot;. II.L.Conference, 1921, Official Report, Page 675).JThe &quot;technical point&quot; mentioned was the risk that the two-third majority necessary for the Draft Convention might not be secured).fhd point is of great importance, because if forgene/al reasons the Cabinet should decide it is desirablenot to ratify the Convention my reservation safeguardsi^he position of the Government:   for in fact the DraftConvention now discloses, as appears from the Memorandumof the Home Secretary, several points which are not infact agreed.
I take the opportunity of referring to a subsidiary point arising out of the Norman Report which is not dealt with in the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum.   The Committee, alluding to the provisions in Article 1 exempting from the general prohibition of that Article white pigments containing a maximum of 2 per cent of lead expressed in terms of metallic lead, call attention to the ambiguitymarising from the use of the word &quot;lead&quot; in two senses, first to signify &apos;white lead&apos; or sulphate of lead, and second &apos;metallic!&apos; lead.   They suggest the desirability of adopting a method of computing the lead content based on a solubility test rather than on a gravimetric estimation of the white lead or sulphate of lead which may be present in the white pigment (Page 32).   I assume that the Home Secretary thinks it is preferable and safe to adopt the method of computation defined in the Convention,(Intd&apos;,)     II. B.Ministry of Labour, 24th September, 1923,
