Paul who has been: asked by the local Labour Party to stand for the Rucholme(Division as official Labour candidate.A few communists are standing as official Labour eanaiaates:   of these M. Philips Price has reported to Head-qimrtars that he is confident of success at Gloucester.     Where 110 communists are standing, party members have been instructed. to support Labour candidates.Tha following list of communists whose adoption as official ktour candidates is suggested by the Communist party, was lJ6caivea too late for inclusion in the body of this report:T.

HIST5 AND THE GENE Bill EJECTION.The Communist polioy towards the election is epitomisedin the following extracts from the issue of &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot;dated November 16th, 1923:&quot;Tho   breakdown of the old oapitalist politics is at hand.&quot;Tho grim spectres of Unemployment and Stagnation have shattered the dreams of tranquillity.     In less than twelve months the Baldwin Government has had to give up and go to the country.     So will tho next Government and the next, until a real Workers1&apos; Government tackle3 the industrial organisation of the country end strikes down the monopolists and profiteers.&quot;Tho Baldwins and Lloyd Georges imagine thoy are going to smash the Labour Movement by raising the old sham issues of Protection and Eree Trade.    That is the reason for the sudd annoss of tho Election, because thoy think the workers are unprepared.&quot;Let the whole Labour Movement answer with a direct attack on the whole system of monopoly end privilege for whioh Baldwin and Lloyd George stand, and which is responsible for the present ohaos.&quot;No half measures.    Shis is a class issue.&quot;Either tho capitalists must pay for the present chaos for whioh they aro responsible, or the workers will have to pay - in longer hours, starvation rates, food taxes, unemployment.&quot;Down with the hypooritical capitalist profiteers, who, even while thoy are talking of the &quot;ruin of industry&quot;, are at this moment making millions of profits.&quot;AtGao^Ltal Levy, not simply to &quot;reduce flebt&quot;, but totake over the the industries thoy are unable to run, to supply the needs of the starving millions.&quot;A Minimum Bate for all workers, employed or unemployed.&quot;If the capitalists are urmble to run the industries of the country, take them over for the workers.&quot;These are the things for whioh the workers are calling.Let tho whole Labour Movement respond.     Never mine! if the leaders hesitate.     Already Bxilip Snowdon is saying the moment is &quot;not favourable&quot; for a Capital Levy.     2o hell with these double-tongued faltorers.1    Drive past them to victory.&apos; ...,..&quot;The roason for the suddon offensive of the conservative government is their belief in the unreadiness of the Labour movement. It i3 this belief that, gives thorn confidence to deliver their offensive at the same moment as their brothersbenefit of the people, toin/
in arms are doing the earns in every country on the Continent, and eo take advantage of the unreadiness of the working class all over Europe outside Hussia to establish the triumph of reaction all over Europe outside Russia.&quot;Consider the position.     Capitalism is bankrupt. Its industries are stagnant.     Its finance is in chaos. Its political system is in complete unsett lenient,    the workers are in misery, deprived of everything, and being stripped of every illusion.     And yet at this moment, when the whole initiative and offensive should be in the hands of the labour movement, it is the capitalists who are able to come out on the offensive and bring up an antique nostrum like Protection as the only positive programme in the field.&quot;Why should this be possible?    Beoause of the failure f&apos; of fighting leadership on the part of the present direction of the Labour movement.     The spectaole of the Plymouth Congress and elsewhere of the bankruptcy, confusion of leadership and sectionalism, the Labour Party Executive^ vaoillating policy (three months ago saying &quot;Yes1 to every word of Baldwin&apos;s), the internal divisions and exclusion policy, the refusal of the united front, the absence of any positive lead, all these have encouraged the reactionaries to believe that now is the moment to strike both on the industrial and political field and establish their victory before the working class has awakened in response to the new movement and leadership that Is developing.&quot;The Communist Party has now obtained the mortgage on 16,King Street to whioh reference was made in last week&apos;s report;on Hovember 15th a oheque was sent to Inkpin for  2,356.15.0,this amount being the balance of  2,500 after deduction of costs and charges.     Some of this money will probably be used duringthe election, but it would seem that other funds are expectedto be received by the Communist Party for this purpose asJ.T. Walton Hewbold wrote to a communist of some means onNovember 14th:&quot;H.Q. hung up a motion of Pollitt&apos;s to get the money, ana 2 weeks slipped by.     The head of the political work is of oourse Mac.     Huff said.     There is no fear but the oash will eventuate it is only the time factor.     I have that  50 of my own, will go into the pile if neea be. You and your little group will perhaps make it up to  150. I am writing elsewhere to friends and family, but my old man is about tied up these days.     Churchill - well I may he selfish but I think from what Eookway says Labour will attack him.    We must hold MEwell and only money threatens failure.&quot;Headquarters have advised distriot organisers that &quot;thematter/
matter of demonstrations depends entirely upon the response made to the appeals for funds&quot;:   one hall is, however, to he taken ijx Glasgow, at the expense of headquarters, for a large demonstration In other centres large halls are to he provisionally hooked, where possible, for meetings on the eve of the poll.It is reported that George Lansoury, Collyer and Inkpin have taken charge of the Communist Party;s Election Fund.The conduct of the communist election oampaign will &quot;be in the hands of the Political Bureau and the Parliamentary Department under the charge of irthur MaoManus.The Communist Party hopes to run about ten candidates at the election:   arrangements have already been made for the under-mentioned to stand: &apos;J.T. Walton Hewhold HOtherue11.S. Saklatvala Worth Eattersea.A. Geddas Greenock.W. Gallacher Dundee.J.j. Vaughan Bethnall Green.Other possible candidates are:lawless Walsall.E.H. Brown Pudsey.Ellen Wilkinson Gorton or Birmingham.W. Paul Eusholme. -In regard to W. Paul, the Politioal Bureau has informed the manchester District Party Committee that:&quot;At the meeting of the Politioal Bureau this afternoon I reported your telephone communication to the effect that the Eusholme Divisional Labour Party were prepared to put forward oomrade W. Paul as thair official candidate at the forthcoming election if we were In a position to guarantee expenses up to the sum of  300.     I subsequently received your telegram to the same effect.&quot;The matter was considered at the meeting of the political bureau and it was decided that if the Eusholme Divisional Labour Party would adopt Paul and run him as the official labour candidate, party headquarters would he responsible for the expenses up to the  300.&quot;J.E. Campbell has been informed by MaoManus that:&quot;I have Included your name in a list of Party nominations which I have sent out.to.those constituencies where no official labour candidate has so far been adopted.Our/
Cur Party locals have &quot;been instructed to select some candidate&apos; from this list and to endeavour to secure the adoption of that Party member aa ths official labour o*a&apos;dl5ate.    This will mean that we ere only permitting any member on the list to fight In the election provided such member is adopted as the official labour candidate for the constituency.&quot;On November 13th the Political Bureau of the Communist party mot to consider the position in regard to the General Election and decided to issue, if possible, a daily paper during the last throe or four days of the campaign for those Scottish constituencies (Motherwell, Greenock and Dundee) which will be contested by communist candidates.     The Scottish organiser has obtained from  irkwoou &amp; Co., printers, Glasgow, a quotation at the rate of:.&quot;4 p.p. daily paper size and got up as &quot;Worker&quot; 10,000 copies  33,Each 1,000 thereafter 33/-...&quot;If funds permit, a daily paper will be issued in London also for the last five days of the eleotion;   failing a paper, leaflets eeS manifestoes will be distributed.In preparation for the issue of extra editions of the paper, locals have been instructed to send the fullest- information regarding Candidates, strength and unity of Labour forces, prospeots, key notes of campaign, arrangements, etc&quot;, to reach Headquarters by the first post on November 23rd, 26th, 30th and Dacember 3rd.&quot;The ?/&apos;orkersE Weekly&quot; is to be issued at once in 6 page form. In order to raise money for the papers, locals have been j^ged to settle their outstanding literature accounts within the 9rt seven days.Arrangements are being made for the distribution of the QQttish daily paper   in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, greenock, atherwell, Milngavie, Paisley, Vale of Leven, Kilmarnock, tyre, Burnbank, ffalkirk, Stoneyburn and shbtts.Headquarters/
Headquarters have issued the following circular to distriot organisers:&quot;Can you recommend any names of Comrades who would he suitable propagandists during the Election?&quot;Those willing to go at a moment&apos;e notice to any part of the country.&quot;I may say nothing has been decided as to expenses or wages yet, but I want an approximate list of names.&quot;Only those likely to be able to handle our case during the Election should be recommended.&quot;The following names have so far been furnished in response to this appeal: i]T.A. Jackson ;&apos;r    \.T.E. Wilson, Eight 29, 12, Eoad, Ely, Cardiff,Geo. Williams, 19, Francis street, Dowlais.E.H. ley, 22, Oaeran Eoad, Newport, Mon.:A. Horner, 93, Edward Street, Maray.

Scott, West Plaoe, Pontypool, Monmouth.Eobert Ogilvie, 73, Gt. Wellington Street, South Side,Glasgow sgow.Allan Campbell, 60, George Street, Bonbill.Gillies, Sort Glasgow.In london the communists are making preparations for opposition at Conservative and liberal meetings:   It is not unlikely that this will take the form of organised hooliganism.Party leaders are exhorting their followers to vote for Labour candidates where no oommuniet is standing, although !&quot;the average Labour candidate does not go far enough to secure emancipation for the working classes&quot; and despite the fact that the economic power of capitalism can only be broken up if an extreme revolutionary movement like the Communist Party &quot;gingery up&quot; the labour Party. IThe following extracts from a olroular issued to Its membersby the Islington looal Party Committee, illustrates the attitudeof the Communist Party towards the labour Party:&quot;The following resolutions were carried at the aggregate! meeting last evening. :; I&quot;1.   That the secretary be instructed to inform the     . j Islington Borough labour  Party that the Islington looal Party Committee of the C.P.G.B. were prepared to offer the whole of its organisation for tho purpose of securing the labour candidate^ return to tho House of Commons.
&quot;2.   VERY IMPORTANT. . That no menber of the Islington local was W^Ive any assistance to tho Labour Birty without instruction from the secretary of the I.P.C.&quot;It will bo soen that tho first resolution oonforms with the general party policy of the united front and the securing of as many Labour members to., the House of Commons. ! It should need no new urge to impress upon you the vital necessity Of every comrade extending themselves to the very utmost in order that the Labour Party shall be made to feel that the support of the CP. is a&apos;thing worth having.    Prom now to the time of the election put aside everything   that is not otherwise of vital Party interest and throw your whole weight and energies into the struggle.    For this purpose I want you to let me know immediatoly^ what you can do or any special qualifications that y&apos;ou &quot;may possess.&quot;a.   Canvassing.b. envelope addressing.c.

What time oan you devote?...&quot;With regard to the seoond resolution it will he seenthat we wish our activities to he utilised in an organised fashion.    We.want the Labour Party to know that when a Communist is assisting in the work, that that comrade is a member of the Conantmist Party.    - It may happen that you havo already ofIezed&apos;&quot;&apos;your Services and have been allocated work.    We do not wish you to give up this work but you must let me know just what work you are doing.     BUT YOU MUST NOT UNDERTAKE ANY FURTHER WORK WITHOUT WSmWTIOTftWnM^&quot;&quot;finally it is neoossary for you to know that a small electoral sub-committee will be meeting constantly during the election and steps will he taken whereby you will he kept in touch with its work.     Comrades on this committee arc Platt, Morris,Knights and Poet-and any especial information should be given to them.     PLEASE ATTEND TO THIS AT ONOE..*&quot; &quot;It is stated that there will he no further communistoonferenoes on the German situation in tho London area for thepresent, hut that &quot;the Communist Party will ask for a pledgefrom each Labour candidate&quot;.According to present arrangements Harry Pollltt is to Assumefull oontrol, on behalf of the national Executive, of the ootomunlst*loction campaign in Scotland.Bollitfa nomination for Paisley was defoated by 20 votea to21 and the Oo-operatiw Sooietieg seem determined to run Biggar(toe Soottish organiser is opposed to ?ollittf8 oandidature under those/

Quite a lot of members are looking sick and unhappy.     Ibey^e had such a short spell in the enchanted preeinots and some of thorn at any rate won&apos;t get back again.   1 However the meeting I had to attend on Saturday forenoon is now canoelled as thoso who were to be there will now hare to be in their constituencies, so that I&apos;ll be able to leave here by the morning train...

If I don&apos;t stand . myself they&apos;re very keen about me giving them a hand so that I shoulfl have plenty work for the next week or two...!&apos;and h. Young, who is at present in Glasgow / is devoting a gooddeal of attention to the part whioh children can play in theelection, has sent the following suggestions to the nationalsecretary of the Young Communist League:-&quot;I think that the attention of the B.C. should be increasingly centred upon the election.    Ono important point I want to raise is that of the Children&apos;s work in the election.     I intend in every district hero to endeavour to do the utmost with the ohiiaren and they can play an enormous part if a proper lead is given.&quot;First I think a questionnaire should be issued to all candidates on the lines of tho programme in the &quot;Child of the Worker&apos; and that the children themselves should discuss the reception that these questionnaires receive and; formulate their own.policy, which candidate they shall support etc., showing that only Communist and left-wing Labour candidates generally are prepared to put up a fight for the children against the Ministry of Education, apart from political education through discussion that the children oan gain.     There is also the important -organisational aspect of the thing, which should be issued through a memo to all Children&apos;s Group Leaders.    Making bannerettes, slogans, marching through the Btreet singing Vote, Vote, Vote, for Sandy Geddes etc as they did to the tune of   about 200 in Barrow.     I also suggest that the Circulars of the Ministry of Education particularly Ho. 8 instructing local education authorities that they, are in no way bound to feed starving ohildren, (cutting down Of education expenditure (Geddes Axe))and 52, recommending that parents of starving children be reported to the Parish Council or Guardians, be studied.&quot;On the basis of these we can formulate slogans, such as &apos;Down with the Baby starvers&apos;, Conservatives have taken away our food&apos;, &apos;Ihe bosses rob us of our food&apos;, &apos;S0 &amp; SO fights for us * etc, etc     I hope this will be don6 immediately through an emergenoy Meeting whioh I think should  bo called as time is running very short and the memo should be out by the end of this week at the latest.&quot;&apos;The national secretary has, in turn, informed Young thfct:&quot;I quite agree with you and disagree with Ferguson regarding the eleotion.    one oannot regard the election as being shut in and apart from our activities:   it should mean increased activities, a better opportunity of getting at the young workers and of pushing our demands before the workers.&quot;All this will become part and parcel of our electoral activities, beoause supporting the Labour candidates does give us the chance of making our position perfeotly clear and pushing forward the conditions of the young workers soas/
as to make this one of the issues of the election.&quot;By taking part in the election wo do not loose our identity, but use the election as an opportunity for getting our policy and programme before the wide circles of workers.&quot;The E.C. disouesed the election last night and the above expresses the general decision arrived at.     We will bo issuing special material to the branches shortly.     ^The p.0. in G-Iasgow must of course make a special effort in support of the labour candidates, Newbold and Geddes in particular, but along the lines suggested above.&quot;It is important that the German issue should be pushed to the forefront in the election.     I am sending you the material on the German situation.     Other matter relating to the General Election will also be sent out.&quot;In &quot;The Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; of November 17th, SylviaIPankhurst, who it will be remembered, severed her connection with the Communist Party of Great Britain owing to her Anti-parliamentary opinions, offers the following advice to oommunists on &quot;how to uee the elections&quot;:&quot;The best way for Communists to use the elections is to hold Communist meetings and distribute Communist literature exposing the futility of the elections.     Do not be entrapped into supporting propaganda of which you disapprove, merely boyaucs&quot; it is uttered by the candidates end their parties, even though you may think one party a few shades less harmful than the other.&quot;Remember that the only thing which will count in t^ie long run, is the spread of Communist thought.     Those 11itie crosses on the ballot papers, recording the mistaken faith of deluded workers in futile palliatives will all find their way into the waste paper basket of old Father Time.     The teaching they reveal will have to be unlearnt.&quot;Show faith in your principles, oomrades;   do not try to induce your fellow stragglers in this hard world to believe in dogmas which you have outgrown;   help them to set out on the highway to the knowledge you have gained.&quot;JKUHISI INDUSTEIAIi ACTIVITY . &apos;The Chief Constable informs me that the saconfi Annual Conference of the National Federation of Trades Councils held at Birmingham on November 17th, was attended by over 100 delegates representing 67 Trades Councils and upwards of 75,000 trade unionists:   Harry Pollitt was in the chair and many of the flelogatos were members of the Communist party.     fhe conference represented the culmination of months of effort on the part of
C H 910 -tbe (jommunist Party to weld together elements of the Labour party movement which would act, in effect, as a rival organisation to the Trade Union Congress.     As regards the actual passing of resolutions the conference was a success from the communist point of view, hut, as the delegates had no power to bind the Councils ; which they represented to ths decisions taken, the conference is unlikely to have much effect on       orthodox Labour organisations. It is perhaps worthy of note that a resolution proposing the re-organisation of the trado union movement on the basis of industrial unionism, was oarried by an overwhelming majority. The immediate aim of the Conference was, undoubtedly, to finger up&quot; the Labour leaders.The Industrial Committee of the Communist Party has been considering the question   of miners&apos; conditions and is of opinion that:&quot;The crisis in the mining industry will soon reach a climax and a special delegate conference will have to be called to consider what are the next best steps to be taken to get a living wage for miners.&quot;In addition to the oommunist programme put forward at the Sonthport and Blackpool conferences, whioh included, inter aD-i/% domands for the termination of tho present agreement, an increase of 80$ over 1914 rates and nationalisation of the mines, the committee is canvassing opinions as to the popularity of a daily (shift) minimum wage or a weekly wage.*A London communist named Bolt, has drafted an &quot;all-grades&quot; programme for the London County Council Tramway Workers, which Is to be considered by the Industrial Committee.The following is a list, dated November 14th, 1923. ofoommunists who are members of trade unions in the south WalesSistriot:   this list does not cover members of the Ued International0f Labour Unions or of the Minority movements;&quot;No. of members in Mining Industry 273.&quot;    &quot;      &quot;        &quot; National Union of railwaymen 16.&quot;    M      &quot;        &quot; Building Industry 8.&quot;      &quot;        &quot; Iron &amp; Steel Conf. 7Confd/

The road to Freedom is tho road of class straggle pursued by the Russian Bolshevik Party.     The road to betrayal is the road of class co-operation pursued by the German social Democracy since 1918, and being pursued with greater zest by tho British Labour movement at the present time.     It is up to all those sections of the movement who claim to base themselves on the class struggle to raise the banner cf that struggle now, not at tho street corner, not in a way which benefits only the capitalist, but within the Labour movement itself in every union branch end in every Trades Council.     The forces of class straggle must align themselves around a common class strugglo policy right in tho heart of the Labour movement in order to do battle against tho time-.servers and the belly-orawlero who are loading the movement to disaster.&quot;In follow of the above extract, interest attaches to a letterwritten on November 8th by an official of the Mid-European bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions to W. Gallacherj.-&apos; &quot;... The comrades from France and Tschecho-Slowaky have been in Berlin for a conference with tho R.I.L.U.   .&apos;Jhe chief purpose of this conference was, of course, our aotivity in different countries in favour of the German revolutionary movement,     It was decided to start a big propaganda drive emong the trade unionists and unorganised masses for making dear the great importance of tho German revolutionary movement for the whole International Labour;   in ease if the French, Belgium, British eta. Burgeosie will fight against the German revolution and support the (German Fadziets it was decided to call the workers to a general strike against the Frenoh, British etc.   Capitalist Govsrnementa.

I Britain.     In tho nearest time Comrade Victor will send yen l-a&amp;tarialc for the Metal Bulletins.    We beg you to pay I enough attention to this Work.&quot;f no. Bed International of labour Unions has addressed a letter Uiag the nocessity for a united Trado Union movement to the iutives of trade unions;   the text of this document is as lows:&quot;November 22th, 2923.&quot;Dear Sir &amp; Brothers,Tho disorganisation that exists throughout the ffraQo Union movement of this country can only be cverlonis by the C-oneral Council taking up all outstanding issues causing controversy betwoen one union and another and as the leading Council in the workers&apos;-&apos; movement, taking authority on itself I ia foroing a settlement on the quarrelling unions.&quot;Vje know that the Plymouth Congress refused to give the Council the power nocoesary to carry out such useful and effective work for the rebuilding of the Trade Union movement&quot;We also know that those who strenuously oppose the giving of authority to tho general Council, are the same people who are most energetically advocating authoritative power being given to the league of Nations, for the purpose of settling tho differences of quarrelling capitalist imperialists. .   Surely the folly of keeping the workers organisations disunited, while at the seme time working for the unity of tho European capitalist class, should be apparent to all.&quot;At. the present time the Railwayman are threatened - with attacks by the employing class.     The aim is to lower $heir wage standards, to reduce them to the position they sere &quot;in previous to the war.     The recent history of the Trade ttolpn movement is the history of defeats.     The fate of the MJSxEeite and the Engineers will be the fate of the gallwaymen un-Sess the whole trade union movement is rallied to their straport, unless the General Council wages the struggle with the&quot; aid of the active organised movement.&quot;We call your attention to t-he following resolution, which is one amongst many of a similar nature passed by branches of the N.U.R. *&quot;Resolution;-&quot;that in the event of National Wages Board coming to an adverse decision, we urge the National Executive to give the necessary notice t-o terminate all existing agreements, substituting instead an all-grades programme end at the same time immediately to call ufepn the General Council of tho Trades Union Congress &apos;/to convene an all &quot;in elusive trade union convention ti, devise a national policy&apos;.&quot;This resolution was passed by the Wood Green and Komms branch of the N.U.R.&quot;We trust your committee will give this resolution the most careful consideration.Nor/
* 13 &quot;*did&quot;Nor is that all;   There is growing up a tremendous body of discontent in the Coal Fields.     The   termination of the Miners1 agreement is now aTTead certainty and that will mean another gigantic miners&apos; struggle;   men like Herbert Jenkins, Noah Ablette A.J. Cook and 3*0. navies -Miners agents - have pointed out the urgent necessity of the General Council, on behalf of the whole Trade Union movement, assuming tho responsibility of mobilising all the trade union forces to the support of the minors.&quot;These are unoscapablc issues.     These struggles must oome.

On November 15th tho&quot;British Fasolsti&quot; whose hoadquarters are at 71, Him Park Gardens, S.W. held a meeting in The Grove, Hammersmith:   about 150 people were present including many extremists who frequently heoltlod the speakers and tried to bring the meeting to a premature conclusion.    The speakers, Mr. A.R. Wood, Ex-Oaptain Hostaliok and Ex-Captain Yignoles outlined the , principles of the British Pasoiet movement which was said to havo patriotic objects including the proteotion of the King and the Smpire and opposition to oommunism.In Soho a group of Italian extremists are endeavouring to form a countor-movement to tho Italian Fascist movement already in existence:   friction between those two bodies has resulted in at least  two disturbances and, in ono peso, peace was only restored by the intervention of the Police who took the offenders to Marlborough Street Police Station, but did not oharge them.    It is stated that provcoation is usually given ly the revolutionaries, but, in fact, there appears little to choose between the two bodies.MSH BEYOLITTIONARY ACTIVITIES IB GREAT BRITAIN.There is little of interest in Irish Republican circles this week:   the open movement is practically at a standstill and lill remain in that condition until after the settlement of the Deportees&apos; claims:   then there may possibly be a recrudescence of activity.There is a good deal of jealousy and bad feeling towards tins Deportees on the part of their&quot;lessfortunate&quot; brethren, and many of the former will drop out of tho movement as soon as they get their money:   Hutchinson, the man who received the largest award in Scotland, is talking of Belling his Glasgow business and starting in a large way in Dublin.The Irish Democratic League is making some headway in thewest/
Wst and north of England and is using tho Ulster boundary question as a plank in its platform-     At Bristol a Iscturs on this subject was delivered by Mr. Bernard Brock, who said that, in tho event of Mr. Baldwin breaking faith, Ireland would appeal to the League of Hat ions *In many part3 of the north of England the division between Irish Catholics and official Labour is being sharply emphasised: in Liverpool they are at open war and on the Tyneslae, relations ere becoming strainod:   the Irish Catholic leaders strongly resent the domineering attitude of the Local Labour leaders.In  aotland the Sinn Fein Clubs are busy organising public meetings to protest against the continued imprisonment of Republicans in Ireland and raising money on their behalf. .On the Irish Republican Army sido of the movement the work of re-organisation is being quietly pushed on.
