Expansion of the Royal Air Force./jCopy of letter from tho Secretary of state for Air to the Secretary to tho&quot;&quot;C&quot;abino&apos;t.&quot; &apos;inet 23), .1.AIR MINISTRY,Adastral House, Zingsway,&apos;.V.C.B.13th December,1923.Dear Hankey,In view of (o) and (f) of Item (1) of the Conclusions,3roaohed by the Cabinet at their meeting on Tuesday, I write to draw attention to the fact that tho Air Ministry will have a really urgent piece of legislation which it is essential to pass through Parliament as early as possible in the New Year, namely, the Auxiliary Air Force and Air Foroe Reserve Bill.Until this Bill is passed into law it will not be possible to start recruiting personnel for the 13 Auxiliary Air Force and Special Reserve Squadrons which are one of tho main features of the soheme of expansion for Home Defence purposes sanctioned by the Government last summer.   You will recollect the great import-anca attached by the National Defence Committee to those squadrons and tho strong desire of the Government as a whole (a desiro emphatically shared by the Dominion Premiers, as they informed the imperial Conference) to remedy at the first possible moment our weakness in the air in face of tha French; and you will therefore be fully alive to the necessity for pressing on this logislation with all possiDie despatch.I also think it important that a reference should be made&quot; in the King&apos;s Speoch to the expansion of the Royal Air Force and the legislation which will be necessary for the purpose.Will you please taxe any action necessary to ensure that these two points are brought before the Cabinet at the proper timeYours sincerely,(Sgd) SAMUEL HOARE.313 WGm&amp;M IS THE PROIERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S iMMMENT.
