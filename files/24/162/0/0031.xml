Two draft Bills (the Pacific Cable Bill and the West indian (Telegraph) Bill) are accordingly circulated herewith, with explanatory memoranda, for consideration at the next meeting of the Home Affairs Committee.

: :s Taolfio g--;hle Btl.2,.The fuostion of improving telegraphic.oojanunicationa with the Isscu&apos; Antilles r.cabinet British Guiana has been engaging -She attention of the Governments   of the United Kingdom, of Canada and of the Colonies concerned, for somo years.     The present service to the Leewrird Islands, the Windward Islands, Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana is at present provided by the West India and Panama Telegraph Company, whioh receives subsidies amounting to  26,200 a year from the United Kingdom, panada and tho West Indies under a contract which will expire on the 30th September, 1924.    The service has however been subject to  reguent, and on occasions, prolonged   interruptions, causing considerable economic losses to the Colonies, and arousing great dissatisfaction.     The cables are old and the Company is hampered by an agreement with another Company (the Cuba Submarine Company) to whom it has to pay a royalty on.all messages whether sent over the wires of that Company or not, and, apart from the fact that the existing cables Will not last much longer, it is essential to provide a new cable free from this entanglement.If the new cable is not ready by September next year all the Colonies except Barbados will be deprived of telegraphic communication with the outer world, and the cables must be ordered now if they are to be ready next September.The Government of the United Kingdom has therefore been led to formulate the following scheme which has been accepted by all the Governments concerned,The scheme provides for the laying of a submarinecable
cable from the lurks Islands to Barbados with extensions by cable to Trinidad and British- Guiana, and for the provision Of telegraphic communication by cable or wireless between Barbados and the Colonies of tho Windward, and Leeward Islands,    At present it is proposed to set up a central wireless station in Barbados and wireless stations in Grenada, Stu Vincent; St. Lucia,. Doiuinica, Antigua and St, Kitts, but a favourable offer from the West India and Panama Company to sell their cables would receive consideration.    It has been impossible to obtain proposals from any private Company for running the system and the Governments concerned have therefore agreed to ask the Pacific Cable Board to operate the    system when established as their agents and at their expense.     The Pacific Cable Board have been approached and have agreed to take over the management of the system subject to&apos;the consent of the Governments represented on the Board, - these Governments being the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Hew Zealand.It has, however, appeared during the consideration of.the scheme that the present powers of the Board are not sufficient to enable them to take over the system without legislation amending the acts under which the Board was constituted.    A Bill has therefore been drafted to confer t&quot; necessary powers on tho Pacific Cnble Board and the Govorn-monts represented on the Board are now being asked if they agree to the introduction of the Bill at tho next Session of Parliament.     They are being asked to let us have a very ear! reply but in view of the approach of the coming session the Bill is submitted, without waiting till tho replies of the various Governments have beon received, for authority to. include- it in tho legislation of tho Session.
The opportunity has at the same time been taken to draft the Bill in the form which will enable the Pacific Cable Board, provided that the consent of the partner Governments   represented on the Board is first obtained, to operate any other system of cables or wireless telegraphy on behalf of any of the Governments of His Majesty^ Dominions,      It iB riot at present contemplated however that the Board should be asked to undertake any work other than cable and wireleBe communications in the West Indies.It will be noticed that the Bill provides that the accounts of any work thereby undertaken are to be kept separate and distinct from the other accounts of the Board and the Board will thus not be able to touch the Reserve Fund constituted under existing legislation.The opportunity has at the same time been taken in Clause 1 (2) of the Bill to introduce a clause legalising the action already taken by the Board (with the consent of the Governments represented thereon) in connection with the two cables worked by the Government of the United Kingdom between that country and Canada.Clause 1 (3) of. the Bill also, requires explanation. At the present moment the \7est India and Panama Telegraph Company are under an obligation to provide a daily naws bulletin to the West Indian Colonies.      This bulletin contains jl a summary of current events and also of market quotations in Hew York.      The bulletin is made up by the Halifax and Bermuda \ Cable Company at Halifax from Canadian newspapers and isitelegraphed to Jamaica, where in return for a payment of  200 a month it is handed over to the West India and Panama Telegraph Company who then transmit it over their (system to the Colonies of the Leeward Islands, Grenada, St.Lucia,St.Vincent,
St.Vincent, Barbados. Trinidad and British Guiana.      There are at present no special press rates to the -&quot;est Indies and those Colonies are almost entirely dependent for news upon the daily bulletin which is thus transmitted over the cables of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company. The West Indian Colonies attach great importance to this service and it is desired to give the Pacific Cable Board power to continue the same facilities.
i 2 iWest Indian ^Telegraph)... Bill.The situation as regards telegraphic communications in the West Indies has he en explained in the Memorandum relating to the Pacific Cable Bill. The Bill now underconsideration is to enable the Treasury to provide the necessary capital for the manufacture and laying of the proposed cables and for the necessary wireless plant. Generally the clauses follow the lines of the Pacific Cable Act, 1901, which provided for the construction of the Pacific Cable, but there is of course, no clause corresponding to Section 6 of the Aot of 1901 which constituted the Pacific Cable Board.CLAUSElfl, of the Bill authorises the Treasury to provide a sum not exceeding  400,000 for this purpose. Of this sum it is estimated that  267,000 will be required for the manufacture and laying of the cables, and not more than  80,000 for the. cost of the wireless plant.     Another  13,000 has been allowed for contingencies, such as office accommodation, and the remaining  40,000 is to enable the Treasury to provide working capital.     It is too soon yet to say how much of the  40,000 will he needed for working capital.CLAUSE II of the Bill provides that the money required may he borrowed and that in that event the rate of interest shall he not more than 5 per cent, and that the capital shall be repaid by terminable annuities not exceeding 30 years.        The intention is that the money shall be found by the National Debt Commisaioners and the exact rate will depend upon the terms on which they find it possible to lend.CLAUSE HI
CLAUSE! Ill   of the Bill provides that the annual expenses, including interest and sinking fund on the capital borrowed shall be charged against the revenues of the systemi and so far as these are insufficient shall in the first place be met out of moneys provided by Parliament.      It is contemplated that any deficiency shall be shared by the Government of the United Kingdom, the Government of Canada, and the Governments of Trinidad, British Guiana, Barbados, Leeward Islands, Grenada, St.Lucia and St.Vincent, in the proportions mentioned in the schedule of the Bill. The proportion of theannual deficiency ultimately to be borne by the Government of the United Kingdom will thus be 80/26-3rds, the remaining 183/263rds of the deficiency being recovered from the other Governments concerned.CLAUSE IV of the Bill provides that any profits shall be applied, firstly, to repaying the capital, and secondly, to the Governments concerned, in the proportions noted, in the schedule of the Bill,CLAUSE V of the Bill deals-with payments, accounts and audit, and needs no explanation.
