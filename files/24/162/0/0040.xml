JLOC.P. 440 (23).cabinet.THE JUDICIAL VACANCIES.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.THE death of Mr. Justice Bray in March and the retirement of Lord Coleridge on the 12th October created two vacancies upon the Bench of the King&apos;s Bench Division. But under the Judicature Act, 1910, neither of those vacancies can be filled except upon the presentation of an Address to both Houses of Parliament representing that the state of business in the King&apos;s Bench Division requires it.The question arises whether Parliament should be asked to pass such an Address and, if so, whethejq the Address should ask for two Judges or only one.Upon Mr. Justice Bray&apos;s death the question was considered, and it was then thought that if it were to be decided solely on a statement as to the number of actions standing for trial at the moment there might be difficulty in answering the question in the affirmative. The King&apos;s Bench Division at the time (June 1920) when Mr. Justice Swift and Mr. Justice Acton were added to its numbers had to face a volume of work which was unprecedented in quantity. In spite of the efforts of the Bench thus strengthened, arrears continued to grow, and it was found necessary upon the occurrence of the next vacancy again to ask Parliament to pass a resolution, and Mr. Justice Branson was appointed. By these and other measures the arrears were attacked and have been cleared off.There was in the spring a decline in the number of cases standing for trial, though there was even then some indication that this decline might prove to be only temporary.Experience since that date appears to verify the anticipation of a renewed increase in the amount of work to be performed by the Division. The number of actions set down for trial at the beginning of the present Michaelmas Term, though it is less than that of the last four years, is very substantial. In every legal year the number of actions set down should be least at the beginning of Trinity Term and highest at the beginning of Michaelmas or Hilary; and the increase shown at Michaelmas over the number set down at Trinity is a fair indication of what might be expected during the coming year. The increase at this Michaelmas over Trinity 1923 is abnormal. Trinity, to Michaelmas 1920 showed an increase of more than 50 per cent; Trinity to Michaelmas 1921 of less than 33 per cent.; Trinity to Michaelmas 1922 of 66 per cent; Trinity to Michaelmas 1923 of 200 per cent. If the figures are looked at not relatively but as they stand, they are sufficient to cause some anxiety as to whether the cases can be disposed of by the present judicial staff without leaving arrears.On a more general survey there are strong reasons for keeping the number of Judges up to the limit allowed by the Act of 1910, or at least for not allowing it to fall substantially below that limit :-1. The divorce work, though fortunately somewhat less than in the years immediately following the Armistice, remains heavy and shows no substantial Tailing off from 1922. It has again been necessary to lend a King&apos;s Bench Judge to the Divorce Court, and I see no prospect that the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Uiyision will be able to dispense with assistance from the King&apos;s Bench Division 1T it is to give a reasonably speedy trial in divorce cases and to deal punctuallv with [10753]
Admiralty - cases. The King&apos;s Bench Division now habitually gives help to the Probate Division in two ways, namely-(a.) In town, by lending a Judge or Judges to deal with divorce and Admiraltywork at the Royal Courts of Justice, and (b.) By the King&apos;s Bench Judges themselves disposing of divorce cases onCircuit.The trial of divorce cases on Circuit only began last October. The cases to be tried on Circuit are at present limited to undefended cases and Poor Persons&apos; cases whether defended or not, and the number of towns at which divorce business may be taken is at present limited to ten. But so far the work has proceeded smoothly, and there is considerable and growing demand which I anticipate it will be necessary to meet for the enlargement both of the class of cases to be heard and of the number of towns at which they may be tried. Further, it is to be anticipated that the number of cases will increase as the country solicitors become more accustomed to the practice.The King&apos;s Bench Judges, therefore, are detained a longer&apos; time on Circuit by reason of these cases, and as time goes on the period for which they are so detained will increase materially.2. It has only been possible to dispose of the heavy arrears in the King&apos;s Bench Division because by War legislation the right to a trial by jury in civil cases is largely cut down. That right has to some extent been restored, and it is proposed to restore it still further by the Administration of Justice Bill, which is now before Parliament. The criticism upon that Bill on its Second Reading shows that, whether rightly or wrongly, there appears to be a strong feeling in favour of an even larger restoration of the system than the Bill proposes. The effect of the partial restoration which has already taken place has been considerably to increase the number of cases in which resort is had to trial by jury. Excluding commercial causes and actions for trial under Order XIV, of the cases set down for trial at the commencement of the Easter Sittings 1922, only one in. every forty were jury actions, while at Trinity of this year over one-third were marked to be tried by a jury, and at the commence-ment of the present Sittings there are no less than 201 recorded for trial by jury a number largely in excess of the experience at the commencement of any Term during the last five years. It is notorious that the trial of a cause with a jury takes on an average at least twice as long as a trial by a Judge alone. It was for this reason, amongst others, that the legislation restricting the right was retained in force until the arrears had been cleared off. But if, now that the arrears have been cleared off and jury trial has again become popular, the judicial strength is allowed to fall, the result must be a fresh accumulation of arrears.3. Nothing could be more uneconomical than to allow arrears to accumulate once more. The existence of arrears is in itself a denial of justice, but, in addition it has the immediate effect of reducing largely the revenue of the Court. If speedy trial cannot be obtained in the Courts, litigants will have recourse to arbitration and when business has once been lost, experience shows that it is extremely difficult to bring it back again. Meanwhile, the main expense of the Courts goes on at the same figure. The building itself cannot be reduced in size or devoted to other purposes. Trained clerks cannot be improvised at a moment&apos;s notice. The standing charges thus remain the same, while the revenue which they earn falls off. The cost of a Judge is limited to the. amount of his salary and that of his clerk, a total of  5,400 a year less tax a very small percentage upon the total turnover.4. One of the expedients resorted to in order to deal with arrears has been the appointment of Commissioners to take the place of Judges on Assize and thus set them free for work in London. This expedient is very unpopular in the country. Litigants on Circuit consider, with some justice, that they are entitled to the services of what they call a &quot; red Judge.&quot; And the practice works unevenly in different parts of the country. In Lancashire and Yorkshire, where on the whole the heaviest class of case comes&apos; to be tried on Circuit, and where also are the heaviest lists &quot; criminal matters, there is special dissatisfaction. By immemorial custom, which is impossible to ignore, the Judges choose their Circuits in order of seniority. T Northern and North-Eastern Circuits, which involve the longest continuous absence from London and which comprise the less agreeable places of residence, are therefore left for the junior Judge, or, where a, Commissioner is sent, for the Commissioner. These Circuits, therefore, which are the most important as regards the volume o work, have again and again to content themselves with the visit of a Commission-instead of a Judge.
The resignation of Lord Coleridge, who had arranged to go the Welsh Circuit this autumn, made it immediately necessary to send a Commissioner to take his place, since the work for all the other Judges, either in town or on Circuit, had been already arranged and could not be disturbed without much dislocation of business. In considering the cost of now appointing an additional Judge, there must be set. off against the gross figure of  5,400 mentioned above, the cost of the Commissioner who will necessarily be employed if such a Judge is not appointed. In the financial year 1922-23,  1,24.2 was spent on fees to Commissioners.5. The autumn and winter are the critical periods of the legal year. During that time the Courts not only feel the effect of the work which the solicitors have been able Lo prepare for trial since the end of the Trinity Term, but are depleted by the absence of most of the judicial staff on Circuit. There are periods during these onths when not more than two Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division are available &apos;or work in London, and any accident, such as the temporary illness of a Judge, or an unexpected rush of work on Circuit, or a lengthy trial at the Old Bailey, may eave the Royal Courts of Justice without more than one King&apos;s Bench Judge, to the reat inconvenience of the public.6. The work of the Railway and Canal Commission is at present unusually eavy. By Statute a King&apos;s Bench Judge assigned for the purpose is Chairman f that Commission. Great difficulty has been Tound during the past year by the ing&apos;s Blench Judge occupying that position in finding enough time for his duties.7. The Lord Chief Justice, upon whom rests the duty of the management of he King&apos;s Bench work, has expressed to me in the strongest terms his view that the ircumstances are such as not only to justify an application to Parliament, but o render that course a plain duty. But there is, in addition, a strong feeling mong the King&apos;s Bench Judges generally whose knowledge and experience are aluable in these matters in favour of again raising the judicial staff to its full umber. For these reasons, I suggest to my colleagues that an Address should e moved in both Houses. The Lord Chief Justice is- anxious that that Address hould ask for the appointment of two Judges in the place of the late Mr. Justice ray and of Lord Coleridge, I doubt whether it would be possible to make a case or the appointment of two Judges. But I think that Parliament should be asked pass an Address for the appointment of one additional Judge.C.House of Lords, November 2, 1923.
