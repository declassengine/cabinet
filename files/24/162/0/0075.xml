$j&amp;MIOAL f^TILISSHS.1, The Committee had before them a Hots (is.B.0.19) by the President of the Board of Trade covering a Memorandum prepared by the Bojjrd of Trade on Basic 31;g and other chemical fertilisers, together with correspondence on the subject with the General Distributing Agency.The Committee were informed that it was most improbable that in any circumstances a duty would be placed on imported basic slag, but that it was desirable to keep a free hand with regard to Super-phosphates. The claim of the General Distributing Agency to be one of the1 largest users  if chemical fertilisers in the United Kingdom was incorrect and the record of the agency was not such as to entitle it to any particular consideration;That while no reply need be sent to the concluding letter da-ted  3rd November;, 1923 from the Goner. 1 Distributing Agency,  if the question of imposing an import duty on chemical fertilisers should be raised in the constituencies the reply should be to the effect that chemical fertilisers are not included in the list of imported articles which the Government did not propose in any circumstances to tax, but that a tax on such fertilisers would not be proposed except ;.fter full and careful enquiry1.The Committee agreed to redomiaend

CABINET.EMERGENCY BUSINESS COMMITTEE.I attach for consideration by the Business Emergency Committee a Memorandum prepared by the Board of Trade on Basic Slag covering correspondence on the subject with the General Distributing Agency.(Intd.) P. LI. G.BOARD OP TRADE,30th November, 1923.
BASIO SLAG.Several inquiries have been made as to whether there will be duties on chemical fertilisers.   The position is as followsBasic Slag.- The capacity of production is sufficieryt to make Great Britain self-supporting, but at present the trade Is badly hit by Belgian competition.SuperphoBphatea.-   Here also there is great capacity, but the industry is badly hit by much cheap import from Belgium and France and there have been many complaints.Ammonia Sulphate. - The home production is more than sufficient and there is a large volume of exports.Ammonia Nitrate, Sodium Nitrate and Potash Fertilisers.-Practically all imported. (Quite unimportant as fertilisers. Chief uses are in &quot;Explosive and Allied Trades).Oaloium Cyanide. - Practically all imported, and not generally used, but home production is apparently under consideration as Brunner Mond have been making enquiries into the position.Caloium Nitrate. - ditto. (Quite unimportant as a fertiliser.   World&apos;s production only a few thousand tons).Bone Meal. - (which may or may not be regarded as a Chemical Fertiliser). - Great Britain is self-supporting.
A special question arises as regards basic slag, in; view of its Importance for use on grass land and in view of its being produced as a by-product.Basic Slag as used for. Agricultural Purposes consists of the finely ground worn out linings rejected from basic steel furnaces.In the limit the production of Basic Slag depends upon the production of basic steel.    In this country /&amp;s ie shown by the following table/ the proportion of basic to acid steel is much less than it is on the continent.    We have always operated in the past to a large extent with high grade Spanish ore.    Germany, France, and Belgium, on the other hand have depended mainly on low grade local ores containing a high proportion of phosphorus.    These countries have perforce hadto produce basic steel (and so basic slag) and the desirability1of getting rid cf a &quot;waste&quot; product has to a large extent determined the vigorous propaganda en behalf of basio slag carried on, particularly by Germany.TABLE I. Production of Basic and Acid Steel in UnitedKingdom, France, Belgium and Germany (in 1,000 tons).United Kingdom.			Belgium.	France (approximate)	Germany.1912	Basic -	2,450	2,252	2,820	16,644	Acid   -	4,347	263	1,608	6581913	Basic -	2,804	2,162	3,220	17/360	acid   -	4,860	275	1,467	S75	r,.......

Moreover, it should bo remembered that this country must, on aocount of the growing soaroity of non phoBphoric ores and of the fact that the bulk of domestic ores a-re phosphorio, increase the proportion of basic steel to the total output.   This will of necessity increase our output of unground basic slag.   Other countries on the oontinent are already working basic ores to the full extent and consequently an increase in proportion of basic steel produced on the continent is not so likely to b&amp; experienced.A duty on steel will give the makers protection and a duty on the baeic slag would be additional to this.
THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTING AGENCY,SOUTHAMPTON. November .15th, 1923.The Rt.Hon.Stanley Baldwin, M.P.Prime Minister of England,10 Downing Street,Whitehall,London.Sir,Would you be good enough to let us kn^w whether it is intended to put a tariff on the Importation of Chemical Fertilizers used for agricultural purposes.As probably the largest users of Fertilizers in the United Kingdom we are anxious to have your reply..Of course the British Farmer has now got to rely on Fertilizers to a great extent to produce his Wheat and other Feeding Stuffs.     In taxing Fertilizers therefore it will be an indirect taxation on Food and a great blew to the Farmer in raising his Fertilizer bill,I may say that we received a reply from your predecessor that an Import Tax on Fertilizers would certainly never be considered.May I add in conclusion, that it is with great.1*1diffidence that I have written this letter, knowing hrw extremely pressed you must be, but the matter is of such vital Importance, not only to ourselves but to Agriculture In general that I felt embolden to ask you for a clear reply on this matter.I am, Sir,Your - obedient Servant,(Signed) Harold G.Gough, HG/GR   .

26til November, 1925,Dear Storr,I think it would be quite safe for Mr- Davidson to reply as follows to the Questionnaire sent to him by the Incorporated Association of Headmasters:-.To the first question      Yes.To the second question - For Mr. Davidson&apos;3 own Information I should say that the re-introduotlon of State Scholarships to the University is at present under consideration by: the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     We are expecting every moment, to hear their decision, and we will  . let you know what it is.To the third question - Yes, so far as is practicable without injury to the public system of education.(Again, for Mr. Davidson1o personal Information, it should be added that the administrative expenditure of Local Education Authorities Is entirely within the discretion of those Authorities.     The interest of the Board of Education in the matter is indirect and secondary.     There are few subjects upon which Local Education Authorities are more sensitive than any suggestion by the Board as to the methods and principles they ahould adept in the organisation of their ovrn offices).To the fourth question - It is very desirable to encourage local Interest in education4, and any steps which can be taken in this direction consistently with proper financial control will be supported.To the fifth question - The principle that a Local Education Authority which has made an agreement with its teachers should stick to its bargain is one which I am quite prepared to advocate.Yours sincerely,(Sgd).

In July there were &quot;2 unconnected centres) one in Bedfordshire and the other in Hampshire,    At these two centres thore were 17 and 11 outbreaks respectively, before disease was eradicated on the 10th AugustsThe present series of outbreaks began on the 27th August when disease was confirmed at Rotherham, Yorkshire T7.R, From that date up to the present outbreaks have occurred at 45 distinct centres in England and Scotland, not more, than 8 of which can be attributed to existing centres of Infection; the origin in the other centres is obscure.when disease was confirmed at Newcastle-on-Tyne and believed to have been introduced by pigs which^arrived there on the 17thft CT^CivMa.tes&amp;ssfft from Turriff, Aberdeenshire, in which district disease vvas confirmed on the 18th tmrntmnk,     Infective animals were exposed in Newcastle and Gateshsad markets on the 20th im&amp;umfc and in consequence of the dispersal of animals from these markets, there Is expected to be a widespread extension of the disease from there such as occurred In the same place nearly two years ago.
