BONAR LAB.&apos;     &apos;    :-; &apos;        . (29th December, 1922^
10th November, 1923.To the Right Honourable Stanley Baldwin, M.P.&apos;Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury.Sir,1.   In our First Interim Report we proposed a very limited range of measures designed to meet the emergencies of the situation and we expressed the hope that.they would contribute to maintain the arable area.     Some of these measures, e0g0 an import duty on malting barley and the application of a system of licence under certain circumstances to the import cf potatoes have not in fact bee n carried out, but the study we have given to the question of the maintenance of the arable area in the months that have passed since the publication of our Interim Report has convinced us that more comprehensive measures are immediately necessary if a further substantial decline in the tillage area is to be avoided; and we assume from the terms of our reference that the production of food, and therefore the maintenance of at least the present arable area, is deemed to be important in the national interest.20   The decline in the arable area *is no new thing. It has now continued for a long period.     With the exception of the years 1916 - 1920, when all conditions were quite abnormal, there has been, save in individual years, a steady decline in the arable area of Great Britain during the last fifty years, the period covered in our reference.     In 1873 the arable area was 18,186,671 acresj    in 1923 it Is 14,478,013 aores, a decline of 3,708,658 acres, or/
20 per cent;   A great part of this decline is dueto the shrinkage of the wheat area, which fell from 3,490,380 acres in 1873 to 1,799,043 acres in 1923, a reduction of over 48 per cento3.      Thi s movement shows no sign of slackening. Almost the whole of the gain in arable cultivation which was occasioned by high prices and by the active measures of the Government during the war has now been lost;   and in view of the prices which the farmer is receiving far his crops and the probable future course of prices there is every likelihood of a further reduction In the arable area.4.      We should view with grave concern-any substantial decrease in the present arable acreage of the country, since the maintenance of that area is an important factor in the maintenance up to pre-war level of the home production of food, and of the employment of labour.5.      We propose within the next few weeks to present a Report which will emVc^y in some detail the results of our Investigations into the main factors which have contributed to the progress of agriculture in other lands.   These factors, drawn from the experience of various countries, have been, (in addition to fiscal policy) co-operation, credit, education, both agricultural and general, tenure, transport and the social organisation of the industry. These methods, which are of very great importance.
are&apos;, however, factors of a long-term character and their influence all be but gradually felt..6.   But if.the decline in the arable area is to he at least checked immediate direct action by the Government is necessary.   If left to itself the farming industry will necessarily adjust its practice 30 as to make farming pay..   But under present circumstances&apos; It will-be farming of.a character which will involve a material reduction in the supply of home grown food and a serious decline in the number of men employed on the land, thus adding yet further to the burden of unemployment. .7.   Having in mind that we are asked in our reference to advise as to the methods by which the prosperity of agriculture, the production of food and ,the employment of labour at a living wage may be increased we think it would be helpful in these circumstances to present at once a second interim Report indicating the nature of the further aotion most likely to. achieve the object in view.8. /In this connection we may observe that direct action by the Government should in our judgment envisage an all-round.policy and in this respect we are in agreement with the principle-underlying the Selborne Report of 1918.9.. There is a divergence of views among the members of the-Tribunal as regards agricultural tariffs and preference, and we do not propose to base any recommendations on those methods.   Vie put - forward proposals with which we are all in agreement&apos;.
10,   In order to maintain the arable area, we have come definitely, though reluctantly * to the conclusion that either a guarantee or a subsidy would be necessary..&apos;   Such a guarantee or subsidy may- take various forms.11.   In the first place, it has bean represented to us that the total arable area in Great Britain is not likely to fall below 13,000,000 acres.   On this assumption this area might be taken as the datum line and a subsidy paid on each aero of arable land in excess Of&apos;that amount.   The total arable area is now nearly 14,500,000 acres and. a subsidy would therefore have to be paid on seme 2,500*000 acres.   Under this scheme each farmer would receive a subsidy on each acre of arable land he cultivated in excess of an area equal to about five-sixths of his arable land in 1925. - The scheme,e is attractive, but it has serious -administrative difficulties.. And. also to be really effective, it presupposes that on each farm there is both good and poor arable1 land;   so that the subsidy might&apos;only help to maintain the arable aras. if the five-sixths cn vhlch no subsidy was paid was in fact land which would in any event remain under the plough,   it is not, however, usually the case that land is distributed in this way, and My-? incidence of the subsidy would be unequal.    Some farmers would receive a subsidy: on good, land which would in any case remain under the plough;   others would receive no subsidy on poorer land which,,.If-unassisted i would be likely either to be laid down to permanent grass or to g  out of cultivation altogether.   Thus the subsidy mighty to a considerable
extent, fail to achieve lts*real object.   The unequal incidence of a subsidy, is Indeed inherent in any scheme that may be devised; but we think that it can be reduced to a minimum if the proposal which we shall submit commends itself to the Government.12.   A second method would bs to grant a subsidy of, say,  1 per acre on the whole of the arable area, which might be defined for this purpose as all land ploughed during the year Including summer fallow, but excluding land under clover and grass seeds, small fruit, orchards and hops .   This scheme is simple and relatively easy of administration.   But it would not give the weighted assistance which we think is necessary, if the wheat acreage is to be kept up.    Its cost on the present arable acreage   as above defined would approximately amount to  10,500,000 per annum; and this would, we fear, endanger its existence as a permanent policy. In view of the financial condition, both present and prospective, of the country /v stable policy Is/ what is required.13.   A third method would be to guarantee a price of wheat to the farmer.   A guarantee is in effect a subsidy on output, which ensures that payment is made only for value received and encourages the good rather than the indifferent farmer.   There are, ho?jever3 serious objections to this method, in that the greater benefit is reaped by the better land where output Is high, whereas help is needed most by the poorer soils, on which output is low.14. A fourth method would be an acreage subsidy on wheat.    This would secure that the poor land would pot be penalised and the good land unduly favoured.   A further advantage of an acreage over an output subsidy is that the
cost of administration -would &quot;be much less, owing to the simpler method of inspection which would, he called for.15.     A fifth form of subsidy that we have- considered is a subsidy on wages.   The maintenance and if possible the extension of employment at a living wage being a principal aim of our enquiry, this might be achieved by a contribution from the State to the farmer5s labour bill. By reducing the cost of labour it is fair to assume that the-tendency towards a reduction In the area of tilled land would be stayed.   The proposal does not seem to present much difficulty so far as concerns the calculation of its cost, and the problem of the small-holder employing only family labour could be met by an assumed rate of payment.   But on examination it seemed to us that the incidence of the benefit would be inequitable, and that the difficulty of administration is likely to be serious-.   A subsidy based   * on the labour bill would give a larger benefit in those districts where Wages are relatively high than in * those where the:/. ,       are relatively low, although it may be presumed that a higher scale of wages indicates a more prosperous agriculture.   This inequity would be accentuated if the grant -Of the subsidy were coupled, as it would t,av;e to be, with the enactment of a statutory minimum wage.   Thus, assuming a Subsidy whioh. worked out - at  10 per man per annum, or approximately 4/- per\;eek,  (which would cost the country about  6,000,000), coupled With a statutory minimum wage Of 30/- per week, the farmer In areas where 25/- per week was paid would pass the whole sum oil to faia men, whilst the employer who pays over 30/-- might retain the whole or the greater part of it for himself- .
Again, this form of subsidy would toe applied to all types of farming, and in our judgment the paramount heed is for the encouragement of arable farming.\He are of opinion, too, that the administrative supervision, involving the checking of the farmer&apos;s returns of men employed and of wages paid, would be both difficult and costly.16.     A sixth suggestion which has been placed before us is also essentially of the character of a subsidy.   It is that land under the plough should be given assistance through partial relief from national taxation.   If the relief were afforded with respect to the Income Tax, the State would only be, called upon to acquiesce in a loss of revenue, and not to make a positive payment.    But many farmers do not come within income Tax limits.   Assistance in this form does not seem to have any advantage to the recipient over a direct subsidy, and it would necessitate a further complication in the machinery of tax administration.17.   Having considered all those methods we prefer a scheme which combines a subsidy on all arable land, with an additional subsidy on land under wheat.   iVe therefore recommend a subsidy of lo/- per acre ,on all arable land as defined in paragraph 12 above (that is all land ploughed during the year, including summer fallow, but excluding land under clover and grass seeds, small fruit, orchards and hops), and an additional subsidy of 10/- per acre on all land under wheat.   The cost of this proposal on the present tilled area of about 10,350^000 acres would be some  5,175,000 and the cost of the additional subsidy.
on wheat  900SOCO, making a total of  6,075,000.    This scheme may cause some increase in. the tilled area, but we do not anticipate that it is likely to rise much above 11,000,000 acres or the wheat area much above 2,000,000 acreso   On this basis the subsidy would cost  6,500,000 and we regard this sum as practically the outside limit.18o     It may be asked why wheat should be singled out for special benefit.   We would reply that it is the main factor in the maintenance of arable farming in England, that it is the most essential foodstuff and that it is the crop which has suffered most by the fall in prices.   The present price of wheat is only 19 per cent above the pre-war level, whereas the index-number for agricultural produce generally is 53 per cent above pre-war, and it does not seem likely that the price of wheat will materially improve.    It is significant too that two-thirds of the decline in the total arable area in England during the last fifty years is accounted for by the shrinkage in the acreage under wheat and barley0 19.     In making our recommendation we are of opinion that in order to place a premium on good farming the Minister of Agriculture should have power to reduce or withhold altogether the subsidy in cases where he is satisfied that the farmer has not cultivated his holding according to the rules of good husbandry as defined in the Agriculture Act, 1920, and we consider that the County Agricultural Committees should be charged with the duty of furnishing the Minister with the necessary information.
20,   As wo stated in paragraph 8 we consider that direct Government action should involve an all-round policy,,   We therefore renew and desire to emphasise the recommendations in our first Interim Report with regard to the creation of district Agricultural Wages Boards. The Wages Board is one of the &quot;methods&quot; in which this country was for a time in advance of other European countries.   Wo could not contemplate a subsidy to agriculture unless a considerable portion of the benefit thereby accruing to the industry was in fact enjoyed by agricultural workers; and this can be made secure by the restoration of the Boards in the modified form suggested in our First Interim Report,   The position of agriculture in national life cannot be improved by its exclusion from our social legislation.   With many years of Trade Board administration in other industries behind us, the hurden of proof is on the advocates of the exclusion of agriculture from similar provisions.    If the weaker method is adopted of confirming rates reached by local Conciliation Committees it is to be feared that one of two results will follow;   either agreements will-not be made, which is generally the case at present;    or they will be made where the men are not strong enough for effective bargaining, so that low rates are liable to receive official sanction, and this result is equally undesirable.   We hope that farmers will agree&apos; to the restoration of the Boards;   not as the price of concessions from the Government, hut because the proposal is inherently right in relation to the present state of British agriculture. The drift of the more intelligent labourers away from agriculture can only be checked by improving their material well-being and by satisfying their desire for a reasonable degree of personal independence.
SI;   We have given close attention to the experience of this country in the provision of Small Holdings during the last fifteen years and to the remarkable developments which have taken place in Germany and Denmark,   We propose to diseuss the whole question in detail in our Final Report..   In the mean-time we wish to record our opinion that the small holdings movement is of the greatest value in maintain ing the agricultural population end that the time has come for a renewed and vigorous effort to extend the establishment of small holders on the land,.  The methods by which we think this- oan be done without undue expense to the State we propose to develop in our final Report.We are,.Sir,Your obedient Servants, (Signed) Wm, ASHLEY.W.CL3. ADAMS.-C.S.
