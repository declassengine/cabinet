7^o. , , (JO(THIS DpOTlEMTjIS THE PROPERTY OF HIS .BRITAOIG, MAJESTY&apos;S (XWISfflim.)SECRET. - -   / 3n/ ,                                        CABINET. TCP. 486 (23) -----THE KING1S SPEECH. , ...    &apos; &apos;/Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education.With the object.-of pessibly assisting the further consideration by the Cabinet of the form of the King&apos;s Speech, I venture to circulate the following observations.The last discussion in Cabinet made it, I think, pretty clear that there is no desire in any quarter to &apos; run away&apos; from the policy advanced in the recent Election,     On the other hand, there was general support for the view that the Speech should not be &apos;provocative&apos;, and several members of the Cabinet expressed the view that, having regard to the uncertainty of time and conditions, affecting the next Election, and to the desirability of having fuller consultations with the Party than time has yet permitted, it would be wise to avoid drafting the Speech in such form that the party would b* inextricably committed to the statement of policy there made, as the platform on which, in the event of an early Election, such Election must be fought,It was further suggested that, if it was the intention of the Government to continue the McKenna duties, etc., there was no need to make special reference in the Speech to action that clearly lay within the field of administration.This is.j. of course, logically true.   Eut the Parliamen-tary circumstances are so exceptional, the question cf unemploy-ment looms so large, and the Speech will inevitably be subjected to so close a scrutiny, that I think to rsfrain from any definite reference to the policy, on which we made so urgsnt an appeal to the Country, would be certainly misunderstood, and cause grave discouragement to many of our keenest supporters.
The force cf these considerations would seem tc be enhanced, rather than diminished, by Mr.. A sou it h1 s pronouncement of Liberal policy.With great deference, therefore, I have attempted to draft such a paragraph as might give expression to the balance that I should personally desire to see maintained, between &apos;reaasertion&apos; on the one hand, and on the other preservation of liberty f&amp;r reconsideration by the Party, should they later so desire.It would, I suppose., follow after the Paragraphs dealing with Foreign Affairs and Preference, on whioh the. Cabinet are substantially agreed.&quot;Unemployment continues to cause me the gravest concern. My Ministers recently lai-d before the Country proposals which, in their judgment, would have contributed materially to a solution of this problem, by affording to Industry a greater measure of security in the home market, and a better outlet for its products.In present circumstances it is impossible to proceed with the&apos; Measures which those proposals .would have rendered nocessary, and your assent will accordingly&apos; be invited in connection with this matter to such further action, as it may be possible to take by way of prevision for unemployment and draft euggeet e d J?aragj^aph.otherwise, in accordance withprinciples legislationwhichhave hasalreadyreceived the approval cf Parliament.ii(Intd.)
