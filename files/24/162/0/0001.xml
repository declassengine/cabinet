S E C R E TrCABINET?3CP.   -401 (23j. WIRELESS BP.OAI&amp;ASTING,,^emoran&amp;um^ by the Postmaster- General)(l)   The existing broadcasting scheme was explained in Cabinet Paper 4071 of the 23th June 1922, and received the sanction of the then Cabinet.    Briefly, it provided for the formation of a Company consisting of a combination of manufacturers of wireless apparatus, open on easy terms to any British firm.     This Company was to be licensedto carry on a broadcasting service until the end of 1924. j-lIIIts revenues were to be derived partly from a royalty on ifgthe sale price of apparatus made by members of the CompanyIand bearing its trademark;, and partly from a payment by the Post Office of 5/&quot; out of each receiving licenoe feeI.--of 10/-*    The Post Office? while retaining freedom to lioense experimental apparatus, agreed not to license any p; 11apparatus for broadcast reception except such as bore the &apos; / trademark of the Company0 i(2)   A main object of this system of marking was to ensureiIthat foreign-made apparatus should not benefit from the market in this country produced by the broadcasting service^ Mre Kellawayj in announcing the scheme to*the House of Commons on the 18th July 1222, said: &quot;I have informed the    ,    m manufacturers that, in the event of their supplying the \capital required and providing efficient broadcasting servioes,fl I will agree that the apparatus which it will be permissible ll to use under the Post Offioe licence for the reception of those] services shall9 for two years, be restricted to apparatus manufactured in Great Britain&quot;9(THIS DOCUipT IS THE PROPERTY OP: HIS BRITANNIC! MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) j
(f(3)   The scheme has largely broker, down owing to the ease and cheapness with which receiving apparatus oan be made at home by persons who have no special skill.    Many thousands of euoh persons have applied to the Post Offioe for licences.    It was impossible to regard them as bona fide experimenters* and the Post Office has had to inform them that, for the present, no licence appropriate to their case ie available.    Probably nearer 200,000 than 100*000 persons are using receiving sets without licence. The Post Office has felt unable, in the circumstances, to take proceedings against them,(4)   In view of the Impasse which had arisen my predecessor appointed a Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Brederick Sykes, to consider the whole question,    This Committee has now reported.    The essence of its recommendations is that there should in future be one simple form of receiving licence without any provicion as to the marking of apparatus.    Undoubtedly this would be the best solution of the difficulty, but the manufacturers constituting the Broadcasting Company refuoe to accept it* on the ground.that it would remove the protection against foreign-made apparatus to whioh they are now entitled.   The utmost extent to which they can be Induced to go In modification of the existing arrangements ia ,to agree to the issue of.a &quot;Constructors Lioence&quot; at an annual fee of 15/- (in addition to the existing broadcast and experimental licences at 10/-) on condition that the licensee signs an undertaking that he will not knowingly use any but BMtish-made parts in the construction of his apparatus. They are willing, however, that this oondition should be dispensed
dispensed with in the case of persons who have already provided themselves with apparatus.    These persons would receive a licence at a fee of 1?/-, without any condition aa to the origin of their apparatus, provided that they apply within (say) 14 days of the notification of the new arrangements.     The Company ask that these arrangements as a whole should continue until March 31st, 1935* when the single form of licence proposed by the Committee could he introduced,(5)   This sohene, like the original scheme of which it is a modification, is open to criticism on the ground that it involves the use of the Postmaster General&apos;s licensing powers for the purpose of ensuring protection against foreign imports; but. on the whole, it seems to be the best arrangement that can be made at present.    The only alternative &quot;is the continuance; of the existing arrangements until the termination of the Company* a 1ioence at the end of nest year.    This would involve further growth of the habit of evasion, with the. result that it would become almost impossible to. eradicate.    Meanwhile,,;..: the. revenues,: of the Company would oontlnue to sufferj and if the service were ; to-oontinue it would, -beoome necessary to. call up -further capital.:   :The six large manufacturing companies, who among them hold the bulk of the shares, and whose representatives form the majority of the directorate, woulcP almost certainly refuae to provide further funds, and it is probable that in a short time the present broadcasting service would cease. It would then be necessary either for the po3t Office itcelf to take on the service - a duty for which it is not fitted -or else to license some other Company,    The present combination, in which no single manufacturing firmpredominates,
predominatee, was only engineered with the greatest difficulty. If it fails, any commercial organisation which might succeed it would almost certainly, for patent reasons, be equivalent to a Marconi monopoly,&apos; and, even then, protection against foreign-made apparatus would be demanded as a condition of the continuance of the service.(6) If, on the other hand, the service were allowed to lapse altogether, public outcry would arise against the Government from the 130,000 licensees who have bought their sets and paid their licence fees on the strength of the implied undertaking that the service would continue for at least a reasonable period,(7)   The Press and the entertainment trades do&apos; not look with favour upon the British Broadcasting Company; they fear the extension of itc activities and interested criticism is likely to focus upon the Report and the Government1s refusal to follow the recommendations.     Other criticism is to be expected from free-traders, who will complain that the wireless monopoly is being used by the Postmaster General to perpetuate an illegitimate protection at the expense of the poorest class of user of listening-in apparatus, and protectionists will claim that the protection is not sufficient.(8)   The new arrangements proposed, apart from the forms of licence, would approximate generally to the proposals of the Committee,    The Committee recommend that*the Post Office should be content with 2/6d, out of the licence fee, instead of 5/- as at present,     I am assured that the 2/6d. would suffice to pay expenses, and I propose that the balance (7/6d, out of the 10/- fee and 12/6d. out of the 15/- fee) should be devoted to the broadcasting service.    After the 51st March,. 1925, however, a sliding scale would be Introduced, underwhich
11which the proportion of the licence fees assigned to the service would vary aocording to its oost as compared with the number of licences.(9) the committee further recommend that the royalty on the sale-price of apparatus made by members of the company ahould cease. i am not satisfied that the income from licence fees alone would cover the oost of the service, and i propose that the royalty should, continue for the present, but on approximately half the existing scale. the company *lave agreed to this.(10)     as suggested by the committee, the licence of the company would be extended to the end of 1926.     until the 51st march 1925, i propose not to give a broadcasting licence to any other organisation, provided the company will erect any further stations which the post office may consider necessary.   &apos; after the 51st march 1925 i should -reserve the right, not only to license other undertakings in oases where the post office considered a service necessary and the.broadcasting company were not prepared to supply it, but also to give to the new undertaking an appropriate share of the revenue, arising from the licences in the district which it served.(ill     certain modifications of a minor character which the committee suggest in the constitution of the company and in the faoilitiea afforded them can be arranged without difficulty.     the committee also suggest that a statutory board should be set up to advise the postmaster general on all questions of importance relating to broadcasting. i propose to appoint an advisory board at an early date, but i see no reason why it should.be statutory.
[12)     In all these circumstances, I think it would be wise to come to terms with the Broadcasting Company on the basis above indicated.(signed)   l. w. e-17th september 193.5,
