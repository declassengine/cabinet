Copy No.CP, 441 . C.AE I O T.FRgifOfl LOAHS 10 LJTT1B,31JIMTB. (Memorandum by..the Chancellor of the Exchequer)v1. Reports have appeared in the Press of a statement by lionsieur Henry Berenger - the Rapporteur of the Finance Committee of the French Senate - that Prance is going to lend l  milliard francs (say  20 million) this year to the Little Entente.
