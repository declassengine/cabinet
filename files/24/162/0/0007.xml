TBS OOMMTOISTSThe Central ffixecutive of the Communist Party is experiencing considerable financial difficulty:   it is reported that most of the money received from Moscow has been used to pay the printers of &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; and that sums, which would normally have gone to King Street have been allocated to the labour Research Department ana the Plebs Leagae.     One informant goes so far as to say that,unless the Party can raise money quickly, Headquarters will have to be moved from 16, Zing Street to a cheaper office.Minutes of the meetings of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party, which are held about three times weekly indicate that the Party leaders keep a sharp watch for any events at home and on the Continent which are likely to lend themselves to exploitation by the Communist Party of Great Britain or by the Communist International.    The fact that, despite the presence of MacManus at the Bureau meetings on September 14th and 15th, W. Gallacher and A. Homer were respectively appointed chairmen, suggests that MacManus is no longer the leader of the Party.The present circulation of &quot;The YJorkers&apos; Weekly&quot; is 43,500 oopies per week:   the sales of the paper seem entirely out of proportion to the numerical strength of the Party:   In Maesteg for instance, where the membership of the group is only 7, 1,368 copies of the paper were sold in August and in Blaengarw, where the membership totals 13, 1,200 copies were sold in the same month. The Central Executive realises the discrepancy betweenthe/
the circulation of the paper and the membership of theParty and has informed distribution committees that:&quot;There has been a tendency on the part of many comrades to regard the distribution of the paper in the light of ordinary newspaper selling. Nothing could be wider from the mark.     In the first place our methods of diatribution are the only methods upon which we oan build our Party organ and our Party machinery.    Secondly, they, enable us to get into contact with workers who in the ordinary course of propaganda activity we should never reach.     But we don&apos;t only want to get that contact to sell them a paper:   we want it to enable us to make the workers who buy our paper also members of our Party.&quot;This means, therefore, something more than just having the Party and going from door to door;   it means that all our comrades engaged on Distribution work are also engaged on the all-important task of recruiting for the Party,&quot;The workers wont tumble over one another to join the Party.     They have to have a personal appeal made to them.     The work of the Party must be explained to them.     The paper helps to do this, but it nesd3 to be supplemented by the personal touch, and this can only be supplied by the comrades engaged in the work of distribution.&quot;This means something more than selling a &quot;newspaper1 or merely being a &apos;newspaper seller1. Our circulation at the moment is 43,500.   Doesn*t this prove the huge field of sympathisers we have to work on?    Try and imagine our Party 40,000 strong - what it could do.     The influence it would wield.&apos;&quot;The Political Bureau is now issuing a new seriesof Propagandist Bulletins which are drafted by TomBell, who is in charge of the re-organised PropagandaDepartment:   some extracts from the document issued onSeptember 21st bear quotation as they constitute thebasis of most speeches made during the week fromcommunist platforms.&quot;The Political Bureau insists that the struggle of the workers in Germany is part of the international struggle of the workers against the whole order of things.The/
The conditions imposed upon the workers in Germany affects the working-class in Great Britain. It is a common   fight and we must join hands with all workers in all parties in demanding1.   The withdrawal of British troops from the occupied area.2.   Hands off Workers1 Germany.Mr. Arthur Henderson at Mevicastlet declared for the withdrawal of all troops,     Here is common ground upon which vie can put to the test, the Labour Party,, the IoL*S., and all other bodies that agree with this demand-     Ths Political Bureau are putting it up to Secies ton Square to declare their sincerity behind their words, and demanding the initiation of a campaign of action now and preparedness for the future in supporting the working-class in Germany...KEiSPOH SIBILITY OF CAPITALISTS(1)   Place the responsibility for the present situation in Central ijurqpe on all the capitalist countries including Great BritalnT  Reparations must not obscure the imperialist designs of either France or Great Britain.(2)   Poincurs&quot; is not only after reparations, but annexations in territory and minerals.    His government subsidises separationist parties in the interest of the sComite des Forges1 the big metal trust of France.(3)   Polncare^s imperialist designs makes, lackeys&quot;&apos; of Belgium, Serbia, Yugo-Slavia,&quot;Bournsnia and Poland,&apos; in preparing against Soviet Russia joining hands with Soviet Germany. -(4)   All the allies ere fostering Fascism as a world^political force to suppress the revolutionary workers1 movement.     Fascism i3 war against the struggle of the working class, and especially the communist parties as the workers&apos; advance guard.     It will be used here as in Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, Germany and now France-    Fascism is the white terrorism and the hand-maid of imperialism.(5)   Baldwin is acting In concert with ^poincare&quot; and Mussolini on behalf of the allied imperialists.POLICY OF GRAKP OOALITIOg(l)   The Grand Coalition (Stressernan, Stinnes and Hilferding, Social Democrats) promised to arrest the financial chaos in Germany, stabilise the currency and prevent the rising prices.    Weeks have passed.     The rich are evading the timid laws and refusing to pay.     Discussions are being held with Stresseman end Poincere to find a wayout/
out of the present drift to social revolution.(2)   The new financial projects are fresh attempts at trickery.     Proposals are being made by the Federation of German Industrialists and by Helferioh, a director of the German State Bank, and an old minister under the Kaiser...THE COMMUNIST policy the policy of our comrades in Germany is to(a) Prove to tho lower and middle peasantry that they have nothing in oommon with large agrarian   interests.(b) Confiscation end partition amongit the poorer peasantry of large landed estates.(c) Demand immediate agrarian   reforms.(d) Work for identification of the struggle in the country with the towns for a Workers1 and Peasants&apos; Government.CP. AHP LABOUR PARTYArthur Henderson declares for(a) Withdrawal of all troops.(b) Cancellation of indebtedness.(o)   Open door for free exchange of good.The withdrawal of troops from Germany is our immediate demand.    If civil war breaks out in Germany British troops will he found aiding the capitalist reactionaries and fighting the workers in Germany.   Demand of the labour Party, the Trades Counoils, the I.I.P., to make a common fight to get the troops out of Germany, end prepare to help in every way the German workers in their decisive struggle about to take place.Withdraw all troops from the occupied areas.Vy with the Workers&apos; and peasants  Governmentin Germany.&quot;The South Wales District Party Committee has giveneffeot to the above bulletin in a circular to localsecretaries in the course of which it is stated that;&quot;The D.P. Committee has been specially informed, regarding the German situation and their attention drawn to the fact that hunger will compel the German workers to revolt...The/
**&quot;The D.P.O.. therefore urge your membership, who are members of the SeW^MoF. to demand a coalfield conference to discuss and determine what form of action would be taken to prevent, in the event of a revolt of German workers viz.,(l)   Blockade of Germany,(2)   Employment of British troops against the German workers.(3)   Shipment of munitions, etc., to capitalist forces for use against the German working class.Demand a coalfield conference to deal with above.    Urge withdrawal of British troops.    Urge general strike in the event of a blockade of Germany.    Comrades go all out for special coalfield conference re above.&quot; .The Political Bureau has requested all fl/istriotorganisers to report immediately on important local issuesin connection with the forthcoming municipal eleotionsin order that Headquarters may issue &quot;a guiding Partystatement.&quot;In connection with the scheme for extending theactivities   of the Communist Party a correspondentinforms me that-;&quot;S. Cant hag given instructions that a report is to be submitted as to what members of the Par East London Branch are likely to be of use in the following directions - Propaganda, Industrial Intelligence ana Political Intelligence;   who are holding a position in the Co-operative  Movement, Trade Unions, and Shop Stewards&quot; Movement;   and any who do not belong to a Trade Union.     The idea is that every man who can be used will be given a definite piece of work to do, with &quot;punishment&apos; for failure and to create a military organisation or rather, discipline, with this punishment1 aa the chief incentive for members to accomplish something.     This is based on I.E.A. me.tJ*ods, same being considered a success in that organisation.&quot;It is reported that 3. Saklatvala, M.P., was invited to Moscow to attend the private conference ofsecretaries of International Committees of Propaganda,which was to be held there on August 29th: he is statedto have been warmly received by Zlnoviev and arrangements were/
were made for him to eee chicherin and Litvinov.THE RED INTJRNAT IONAL OP LABOUR UNIONS&quot;The General Secretariat of the InternationalPropaganda Committee of Metal Workers&quot; has sent a copyof confidential circular No. 3 dated Berlin, September12th, 1923, to the British Bureau of the Red Internationalof Labour Unions:   in the oourse of this circular it isstated that:&quot;Enclosed, a report of the 1.1*.Q   of May -September that will inform the comrades on our connections and activity.    The secretariat deeme the present situation not quite satisfactory. In Engl nd5 no   activity is as yet to be ascertained. The connections with Scandinavia are but weak.    A whole row of countries doss not respond to our efforts at connecting.    Yfe must-, la spite of ell that, state vie have had certain successes.     Our forces are &apos;not only growing ideologically, but al30 organisatorily.     We must energetically continue our activity, and at all oases   stick to our achievements.     The exchange of correspondence and information must be made more lively.&quot;for helping that scheme on the secretariat has decided to send a representative for a certain period to Berlin.    That measure is to facilitate the connections with the countries of Central and West Europe.     As to the material contained in the report, that on the Inner organisatory measures and on the fin an o i aT&quot; situation ioli&quot; ar e&quot; nl^Pl&quot;b be&quot; pub 1 iaEeaT18The report mentioned above contains the followingreferences to Great Britain:&quot;An Enlarged Meeting of the Secretariat of the I.P.C. was held after the session of the Central Council of the E.I.I.U.JULY * .The Enlarged Meeting was held July 4th.

South Africa ana hopes to maintain a regular exchange of letters !&apos;&amp;s it is important for the development of our colonial work that frequent communications be maintained.&quot;xHB uhjafflqybp............................ iFrom the information received this week, it wouldappear that the National Unemployed Workers&apos; CommitteeMovement is at present disorganised:   it is suffering inLondon from the competition of the rival body, theUnemployed Workers1 Organisation and from the fact thatHannington is finding that, for the moment at least, heoan make more money out of lectures on his recent visit to Moscow than out of his usual work among the unemployed..At the same time determined efforts are being made to1pull the movement together and It is not impossible that,- if unemployment increases as is feared in the coming- . 1-months,the movement may become a disturbing factor.A confidential &quot;Call to Action&quot; was issued from the headquarters of the National Unemployed Workers1 CommitteeMovement on September 22nd, in which the secretaries oflocal committees were informed that:&quot;(1) We propose to immediately commence aGreat Winter Campaign:   500*000 leaflets have been printed for us, by the &quot;Dally Herald,&apos;, free of charge, a copy of which is enclosed.    We want you or your Committee to immediately send in for  j a quantity of these and carry on a house-to-house canvass with them for getting new members into the local movement.    You can have as many thousands as you like &amp; l/- per thousand, this is to cover cost of carriage and incidental expenses only.    Now don&apos;t miss these send your orders at once with cash, we want to smother the whole country with them.( ) Now during the summer months as a resultof the general apathy of the unemployed, the local authorities have made big cuts in the scales of relief and are still contemplatingfurther/
further outs.     Therefore immediately commence organising Mass Marshes to the Guardians to demand our- National Scale for the winter.   You may not uueceed in obtaining this at first, but you will at least be able, if you hays a sufficient backing, to win back the old scale.Immediately commeahe an agitation in your locality, the same as will be in operation elsewhere, for the immediate reassembly of Parliament.     In this Campaign approach the looal labour and Trades Council and ask them to co-operate with you in organising Great Demonstrations for this purpose.    Flood the country with demands for the reassembly of Parliament to tackle the question of Unemployment which is getting worse every week.    ASK YOUR M.P. AND OTHER SUCH B802LBV   WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?Understand clearly that Parliament is on HOLIDAY until November 17th whilst millions are faced with STARVATION.    Force Parliament to meet, we shall then follow up with other activities to compel them to de something effective.     In this campaign we shall endeavour to get the &quot;whole labour Movement to participate.Further, prepare for the ccming local elections in November, if any.     See that only the right candidates are elected.?     We are getting out a new Questionnaire fo? these elections and we want all our Committees to send in suggested questions which thsy think should be embodied in same to be submitted to the candidates.Now study these four points of activity(1) leaflets. (Zl Marches to Guardians. (3) Reassembly of Commons. (4) local Elections.The great thing comrades is to get the unemployed moving again, and we can do it if we put our baoks into these activities, greater activities then can follow.    So get right down-to it, no time must be lost.    Where your Committee has fallen flat get it going again.The position of the unemployed Is already too serious and will certainly become worse9 unless we put our baok3 to the wall and start fighting against those who are striving to drive us ever lower into the social abyss of poverty and misery.Understand, not only is the man suffering, but the wife and kiddies also.     Then stand uplike/
like mentally    Make a fight fox it /     Get the women with you and hand yourselves together more than ever before?    Cease cringing and wailing, start hitting baokl    Get going on these four points of activities and give them clearly to understand that wo are not prepared to starve in silence during the forthcoming winter.Yours in the struggle,J.W. Holt, W. Hannington, P. Haye,Chairman. Organiser. Secretary.&quot;The leaflet in question enumerates the objects of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement and appeals to the unemployed to join that movement:   the reverse side is an advertisement of &quot;The Daily Herald&quot;.A ciroular has also been Issued to local secretaries by lily Webb, women&apos;s organiser of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement urging the necessity of organising unemployed women.The Communist Party has decided to plaoe two columns of &quot;The Workers1 Weekly&quot; at the disposal of Hannington end Haye each week for the National Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement.The London District Council of the National Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement decided 9n September SOth to print its own contribution stamps instead of getting them from national headquarters:   this decision, which was taken in consequence of financial stringency, is being opposed by the National Administrative Council which states that it is equally short of money.Members of the Southwark branch of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement are at loggerheads with the looal group of the Communist Party from which they rent the Comnunist Hall in Browning Street:   they reoently received notice to give up possession butrefused/
refused to do so:   Cant called together a body of communists to take the Hall, but they were met by unemployed armed with sticks and iron bars:   the latter are still in possession but are paying no rent.The total membership controlled by the London District Counoil of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement at the end of August was 2.114 but the paying members numbered only 1,430.The Unemployed Workers1 Organisation, which hasbeen formed in opposition to the National unemployed workers&apos; Committee Movement, claims to heve, in London,a paying membership of 1,490 made up as follows.Bow 690il Poplar    400Millwall 180 Edmonton 220This movement is said to be making headway in Bow andPoplar:   in Bow the Committee is reported to have a tableoutside each of the two stations where relief is given on Wednesdays:   pickets are employed to ask eaohIndividual who draws relief if he or she is a member ofthe Unemployed Workers1 Organisation and, if not, it issuggested that it would be advisable to take out a oard:it is claimed that many members have been obtained in thisway.     The same method has been applied in Poplar but with less success than at Bow. IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINThe Irish Republican League open-air meetings havefallen flat this week owing to the difficulty of gettingspeakers:   an attempt was made on Saturday to obtainspeakers from a neighbouring unemployed meeting onClapham Common to Interest the small orowd round the platform, but this was unsuccessful so the meeting was abandoned/
abandoned.     The President and the Seoretary were warned some little time back as to the oath in the application form for membership coming under the provisions of the &quot;Unlawful Oaths Act&quot;:   the President has gone to Ireland on a holiday.The Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army in Dublin is said to be shortly sending over an officer to go. into the workings of the league and generally to re-organise the London Irish Republican Army,Brian CHannigan, the Treasurer of the Prisoners&apos; Dependents&apos; Fund, is in consultation with his colleagues for &quot;a scheme of national re-organisation for the people of Great Britain,&quot;The details are not yet known but there seems to be rather a shyness Just now amongst ardent Republicans in parting with more of their money.    An attempt to got a subscription from the Gaelic league met with a refusal from the Central Council.The Gaelic Athletic Association in London is going through a bad financial period, and the membership is dropping:   a propaganda campaign through leaflets outside London churches is being talked of by the Republican members, who have regarded the Association as a good recruiting ground.*
appendix the following report of the unemployed disturbanceat Poplar on September 26th has been received:&quot;The Unemployed Workers1 Organisation decided to send a deputation consisting of three members from the Bow and Brimley, Millwall and Poplar branches respectively to the Poplar Board of Guardians. The Deputation was received and demanded 3/- per week in relief for eoelo    This the Guard lens refused to grant end they Intimated that they intended to reduce the present rates of relief,.     On hearing this the deputation recommended to&apos;the men that they should lock the Guardians in their offices and keep them there for the night.     Edgar and George Lansbury tried to get out but they were&quot;prevented owing to the fact that the doors were barr ceded and the Guardians subsequently decided to secure the aid of the Police and a written note to this effect was thrown through the window.    As a result the Police forced an entry through the window downstairs and , subsequently opened the doorso    When the doors were opened the unemployed ran to get out with the exception of three or four who made an attack on the Polios:, end a general m lee ensued.    About three quarters of an hour after tho Felice were called, the streets in the vicinity were cleared and the Guardians were on their way home.    Several of the men were afterwards treated at the Poplar and St. . Andrews Hospitals.    Between twenty and thirty were wounded.     There were about 600 unemployed present among whom were Johns, Bellamy of Poplar and Golcby, organiser of Bew.&quot;Missiles were thrown in the course of the struggle and police used their truncheons:   eight policemen were slightly injured and a little damage was done inside the building:   one man was arrested.
