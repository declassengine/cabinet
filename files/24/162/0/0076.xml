DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT]FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE MEMORANDUM BY THE, MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES,For tlie Last three months the Ministry of Agriculture has been fighting a very serious visitation of foot-and-mouth disease.Earlier In the year a small number of outbreaks were successfully dealt with.    , In April two isolated outbreaks occurred in Essex and Norfolk,     In these cases there was no further spread of the disease.     In July there were &quot;2 unconnected centres) one in Bedfordshire and the other in Hampshire,    At these two centres thore were 17 and 11 outbreaks respectively, before disease was eradicated on the 10th AugustsThe present series of outbreaks began on the 27th August when disease was confirmed at Rotherham, Yorkshire T7.R, From that date up to the present outbreaks have occurred at 45 distinct centres in England and Scotland, not more, than 8 of which can be attributed to existing centres of Infection; the origin in the other centres is obscure.when disease was confirmed at Newcastle-on-Tyne and believed to have been introduced by pigs which^arrived there on the 17thft CT^CivMa.tes&amp;ssfft from Turriff, Aberdeenshire, in which district disease vvas confirmed on the 18th tmrntmnk,     Infective animals were exposed in Newcastle and Gateshsad markets on the 20th im&amp;umfc and in consequence of the dispersal of animals from these markets, there Is expected to be a widespread extension of the disease from there such as occurred In the same place nearly two years ago.     Outbreaks have already occurred at Sheffield, Rotherham, Barns ley, Northallerton, ^orksop, Kalton and Newcastle and district, and many other suspected cases arecret.CABINET.On the 25rd November, there&apos; was&apos;a serious development
under investigation.    As a precautionary measure, therefore, tho whole of the country from the Clyde to the Thames, but excluding Dales, has been scheduled for the time being, so as to control movement until the situation is cleared, up.The area which is causing most anxiety, however, is Cheshire, and Shropshire, where outbreaks have been occurring almost dally during the last   three months-.    The outbreaks in this area are now so numerous that it is becoming almost impossible to cope with them owing to the shortage of butchers and veterinary staff.Since 27th August there have been 769 outbreaks of the disease In the country; the number &quot;of counties affected is 27 in England, 2 in Wales and 9 in Scotland,    The number of animals slaughtered or authorised to be slaughtered is as follows:-Cattle 24,893Sheep . 13,360Pigs 14,189Goats &apos;   26The estimated gross cotapensatlon payable to date- is  742,000,    The estimated receipts from salvage of healthy caroase3 is  150,000, so that the net cost of compensation so far amounts to  592,000.     Additional miscellaneous expenses are estimated at  90,000, so that the total commitments to date amount to  682,000.The financial arrangements are governed by the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, which provides In Section 15(5) that the compensation for slaughtered animals should be paid out of the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia Account for Great Britain,     Section 18 of the Act provides for the payment into the Account of such moneys (not exceeding  140,000 in any one year) a3 may be provided by Parliament and that if in any financial year the money standing to the Account is insufficient to meet the liabilities the
difference shall be made up out of the Local Taxation Account and the Local Taxation (Scotland) Account.in the proportion-of 88 and 12 per cent, respectively.     Included in the maximum grants of  140,000 for Great Britain, and, under Section 73,  20,000 for Ireland, are sums up to  50,000 for Swine. Fever. Great Britain&apos;s share of the Swine Fever Grant amounts approximately to  40,000, so that the amount available for foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain is limited to  1.00,000 a year.At the commencement of the present-outbreak of disease the balance on the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia Account available for foot-and-mouth disease was approximately  75,000, and consequently it has been necessary to draw from the Local Taxation Accounts. The Ministry has already received  100,000 from this source and application has been made for a further  150,000.    At present the disease shows no signs of abating and it is impossible to form any estimate of the total sum which will eventually be required,Nevertheless, I am convinced that the present policy of slaughter Is the best one.    The object of this policy Is to stamp out the disease Immediately it makes Its appearance and by prohibiting the movement of stock in the district to,prevent the spread of the disease to other areas ,     During the serious outbreak of two years ago, the ministry,of Agriculture was given authority to spend up to one million pounds in compensation.   The whole of this amount was not required, however, the disease being stamped out at a cost of about  750,000, including administrative expenditure.    The Departmental Committee which made an exhaustive enquiry into that outbreak reported that the policy of slaughter was the correct one and should be maintained.     Although we cculd not, of course, continue the slaughter policy indefinitely in face of continuous and prolonged invasions of the disease, I consider that we should be prepared to spend at least a
million, pounds in stamping out the disease before we admit the nec^ity of reconsidering the present policy.The slaughter policy has been successful in the past. Previous to the la3t two years, which can justifiably be regarded as abnormal, the country has been kept practically free of the disease for 30 years at an average annual cost to the Exchequer of  9,000 in payment of compensation for slaughtered animals.R.A.S.MINISTRY OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES, 5th December, 1923.
