My Ministers are bound equally to Eis Majesty*s1&apos;OTeniment and to their own people to observe and., abide by the &quot;us of that instrument, ana they have faithfully and pupulously fulfilled their obligations &apos;in that respect and jtotainaa the position created by the Treaty with the steady pport of the Irish people and at the oost to them of much Bering and heavy material loss.The procedure for determining the boundary between Fwiern Ireland and the rest of Ireland has been fixed by the pty Mid by Statute both of the United  ingdom and of the Irish State.   It would be indeed a source of gratification to my ministers--
Ministers if, at tbe same time, a discussion such as that suggested, would open up a prospect of remedying the present unsatisfactory position of northern Ireland in relation to the rest of the country in a manner compatible with the fulfilment of their trust to their people, and fair and reasonable to the parties concerned, the more so as such a result would remove a cause of contention tending to Impair the future amicable relations between Great Britain and Ireland,4.       In this spirit, and with this desire, my Ministers are prepared to aonfar as suggested, and they accept the invitation of His liajesty&apos;s Government in the hope that a basis may be found for the harmonious oo-oper&amp;tion of the whole Irish psople for their common weal,5,       They will accordingly be glad to learn at Tfour Grace&apos;s early convenience the date suggested for the meeting.I have the honour to be,% Lord Duke, Your Grace&apos;s most obedient, -humble Servant,(Signed) T.H.

Tim ULSTER BOUNDARY. HISTORICAL OUTLINE BY THE GOTERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND^The old Province of Ulster consisted of Nine Countiea, in four of which the majority of ths population was Unionist in sympathy, whereas in three counties there was a majority with Nationalist sympathies.   In the other two Counties - Fermanagh and Tyrone - the situation in 1919 was that there was a small Unionist majority, hut during the War and largely .as a result of the fact that the Loyalists volunteered in very large numbers for Active Service and their places were immediately filled by Southern disloyalists, the population in these two Counties is now approximately equal, though the numbers of Unionist Landowners, Farmers, and Ratepayers &apos;are overwhelmingly greater than those of Sinn Fein tendencies.In 1920, against the wishes of the people of Ulster, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 was brought in as a final settlement of the Irish Question, by it Governments were to be established In Northern and Southern Ireland.   In the interests of peace   the people of Ulster, in order to meet the representations made by the then British Government reluctantly agreed to surrender the&apos; three Counties - Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal - in which Sinn Fein sympathies predominated, although in each case a very large Unionist minority is to be found, and even to-day a Unionist and Loyalist Is actually sitting as Senior Member for County Donegal.   The Act of 1920 was passed,-definitely determining the area of Northern Ireland to consist of the six remaining Counties, together with Belfast and Londonderry.The Northern inhabitants accepted the decision and sat a separate Government in accordance with the terms of theAct.....
Act.   In the South, however, the agreement arrived at with the Nationalist Members was rejected by the people and a2r)2claim for much wider pavers put forward. &quot;As a result of subsequent negotiations between the Imperial Government and the representatives of Southern Ireland, the Free State Government was established by a Treaty negotiated by Mr.Lloyd George (then Prime Minister) and Mr. Michael Collins.   The prime Minister of Northern Ireland, having made it clear that Northern Ireland would under no circumstances be prepared to become a portion of the Irish Free State but would continue to carry out the duties which ha . been transferred to it under the 1920 Act, had informed Mr. Lloyd George that he thought it would be better that all negotiations between the Southern Ireland and the Imperial Government should be dealt with entirely by the representatives of those two Governments, and that no representative from Northern Ireland should be invited to attend unless some matter arose affecting Northern Ireland.   Mr. Lloyd George, whan he found that there was no prospect of Northern Ireland altering its decision, accepted this course of action, and on the 25th November 1921, gave a personal written undertaking to the Prims Minister of Northern Ireland to be read in the Northern Parliament couched In the following terms&apos;:-. &quot;By Tuesday next either negotiations will have broken down&apos; or the Prime Minister will send me new proposals for consideration by the Cabinet. In the meantime the rights of Ulster will bo    . in xlo way sacrificed or compromised1&apos;.The Treaty agreed to between tho Imperial Government and Southern Irish Representatives was not referred to the Government of Northern Ireland although it contained a clause that the Boundary between Northern Ireland ana the Free &quot;State should be determined by   a 3ound ary Comai s l i o... i.
ci jv 9 (J i) tiUnavailing efforts were, made to ascertain exactly what was entailed by this proDOsal and whether merely a smallrectification of the frontier by mutual agreement was intendedof whether the Boundary Ooixiission was to consider the transferof large areas, which was the interoretation placed   upon it by Mr. Michael Collins..The Imperial Government subsequently arranged for direct negotiations between members of the I&apos;       tate and members^of the Government of Northern Ireland when this and other points jof difference were frankly discussed,   As a result of this conference an agreement was arrived at on the 21st January,1922, vide Command Paper 3648 dated 24th January, 1922, of   .which the first clause reads as follows :-&quot;The Boundary 0omission ^^outlinejijjijhe. Treaty .to ba altered.   The Government of the  director State and of Northern Ireland to appoint one representa-tive, each to report to Mr. Collins and Sir James Craig, who will mutually agree on behalf of their respective&quot; Governments on the future Boundaries between the two.&quot;This document was signed by Mr. Michael Collins and by Sir James Craig, and was formally sanctioned by the Imperial Government.In the opinion of the Government of Northern Ireland it is felt that this clause amending&apos;the Treaty and formally approved by the Imperial Government is at least as binding upon the Imperial Government as the Treaty itself.   The Govern-mailt of Northern Ireland holds that the provisions as to the Boundary commission are in conflict with ethical justice and public right - with ethical justice because they destroy an agreement without the consent of one of the parties to it; with public right because they override the constitution of a -body which had received legal existence before the agreement was made.The position is that a technically valid provision has become in practice unenforceable because it lacks, by reasonof its conflict with ethical justice and public right, thesanction of general public opinion.   A somewhat similarinstance /
instance of such a conflict will be found in tho history of the United States Statutes regarding the Panaaa tolls, and it may perhaps be illuminating to refer to that history.The Kay-Pouncefote Treaty (made between the United States and Great Britain in 1901) transferred the rights of ownership and construction in tho Panama Canal exclusively to the United States,   However, Article III of the Convention of 1901 provided that -&quot;The Canal shall be free and open to the vessels of Commerce and War of all nations observing theso rules on terms of entire equality,, so that there shall be no discrimination against any such nation, or its citizens or subjects, in respect of the conditions or charges of traffic, or otherwise,&quot; Nevertheless tho American Congress in 1912 passed the Banana Canal Act, which provided that &quot;no tolls shall be levied upon vessels engaged In the coastwise trade of the United States,&quot;     Groat Britain protested against this exemption as a violation of the Treaty and after protracted and intricate diplomatic interchanges President Wilson, on March 5th, 1914, went before Congress and asked the two Souses to repeal that clause in tho Panama Legislation whichgranted preferential treatment to American coastwise shipping. Both Houses of Congress eventually passed the Repeal Bill by large majorities.   &quot;Something new&quot; writes an American Commentator, &quot;had appeared in the history of legislative ohamberse   A great nation had committed an outrageous wrong -that was something&apos; that had happened many times before in all countries But the unprecedented thing was that this same nation had exposed its faults boldly to the world.&quot; It would seem that in the case of the United States, there did not e:sLst any third-party commitments so as to entangle the hands of the Government and nation in undoing their error,   In the Irish Boundary question suoh committments do exist.   But they areno
no justification for the initial error though they may add to the penalty to be paid for it. &apos;In measuring the breach with ethical justice in connection with the Irish Boundary Question., one further fact must   be considered - the general breach of the 1920 settlement.   That settlement involved not only definite boundaries hut two equal subordinate provinces, plus strong power for dealing with recalcitrancy in either Province hy means of a Crown Colony Government.9th October, 1923.2; Whitehall Gardens, ,S.V,. 1., October 23rd, 1923,
