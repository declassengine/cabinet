CONFIDENTIAL.---&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;4! o: . \ ;\ :;;   - ..... i.&apos;ci S:;CP. 459 (23).King&apos;s Speech on Prorogation.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,My Government have recently initiated negotiations aiming at the appointr nient, with the collaboration of the United States, of a Commission of Enquiry to determine Germany&apos;s capacity to pay Reparation. Unfortunately it has not been possible to secure the assent of the French Government to these proposals, which it had been hoped would lead to a solution of the Reparation problem. My Government regard with profound anxiety the continuance of the present economic conditions in Europe, which depend so largely on the settlement of this question.A serious situation has developed in Germany which is engaging the close and earnest attention of My Government.The arduous negotiations for peace with Turkey, begun in November 1922, have, I am happy to say, been brought to a successful conclusion. A Bill to carry, into effect certain provisions of the settlement reached at Lausanne on the 24th July last will be laid before Parliament as soon as possible.It is My earnest hope that the conclusion of this Treaty may bring real peace to the Near East, and may herald an era of political and commercial prosperity for Turkey and for the countries which are renewing friendly-relations with her.Negotiations are proceeding with the United States Government for a settlement of the difficulties with regard to the carriage of liquor in transit, and illicit importation, into the United States.I deplore the disaster which has recently befallen Japan. The heart-felt sympathy of My country is with the Japanese Government and people, our former allies and close friends, who are bearing this national tragedy with characteristic fortitude and heroism.My Government have welcomed the opportunity afforded them during the last few weeks of meeting so many of My Ministers from the self-governing Dominions and the representatives of India.The Conferences which have just terminated brave been marked throughout by a spirit of great cordiality and good-will. Important questions affecting the foreign relations and the defence of My Empire were carefully examined, and particular attention was devoted to the promotion of trade and settlement within the Empire upon which the well-being of My people so largely depends at this time. I am convinced that meetings of this kind are of the highest value in promoting the spirit of mutual co-operation amongst My people at home and overseas.Memburs of the House of Commons,I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.[108781 -  ,&apos; -
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,The position of agriculture and the problem of unemployment throughout the country continue to cause Me deep anxiety. Despite all the efforts of My Government to stimulate trade and to alleviate distress, the circumstances of large numbers of our fellow-citizens still remain deplorable. My Ministers are convinced that unless measures for the safeguarding and development of the home market are adopted, no permanent improvement in their situation can be expected. iIn bidding you farewell, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.November 16, 1923.
