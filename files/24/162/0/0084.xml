SJ  ^C RET. CP. 483 (25)G A--B I,N--E T. JUVENILE UNEMPLOYMENT&quot; gQMMITTEB!. -    REFOBf&apos;,.COMPOSITION    1.    The Committee oompesssd of Representatives of AND TERMS OPREFERENCE.      the Treasury, the Board of Education, the Ministry of Labour and the Scottish Education Department was appointed by the Prime Minister to report to the Cabinet :-(I) What steps would be required to extend the school age for children from 14 to 16 and to give them technical education with some maintenance allowance (or to such as had not suitable employment to go to) and what would be the cost,(2) How Committees could be appointed of Education and Labour to comb out the lists of the unemployed say until 20 years of age so as to offer to those suitable technical education with maintenance;   what steps administrative and legislative are necessary and what would be the cost. 2.    The Committee are advised that it would be wholly Impracticable to provide &quot;technical education&apos; in the generally accepted meaning of that expression to the juveniles in question and they have accordingly con-strued the expression &quot;technical education&apos; In (1) abosTHIS DOCUMENT IS^HE ?ROPERTi/OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
as referring to some form of practical instruction and in (2) above as connoting instruction such as is given in Trade Schools in the Government Instructional Factories for Disabled Ex-Servide Men and in the Juvenile Unemployment Centres.IjUVEIillES   3.     While there are ho reliable data on which to base an \ laGEL FROMIl4 - 16.    .estimate -of the aggregate number of unemployed juvenilesbetween the ages of 14 and 16 the Committee are advised that this number should not be taken  at a figure Substantially^ below 100,000,    In many cases the unemployment is intermittent.In the short time at their disposal the Committee have not been able to examine detailed proposals but they, have had under general consideration the following suggestions for alleviating the situation:-(k)   The retention of children at school by the raising of the School age of obligatory attendance. (B.)   The further extension of the present systemof Juvenile Unemployment Centres * (G)   The extension of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme so as to cover juveniles from 14 - 18.RISING 4.     The comnulsorv school age at present is the end of the !)F SCHOOL .[EAVIHG term in which a child is 14, children may remain voluntarily iG3. . &quot;at school until 16, and a large number do remain after the age of 14 particularly in &quot;0en1?ral&quot; Schools.   Under Section 8 (2) of the Education act 1918 (para. 46 (2) of E.A.I921) a Local Education Authority in England and Wales may fciaxe byelaws raising the compulsory school age to 15, these byelaws require to be approved by the Board of Education. Section 8(3) of the Act of 1918 (paragraph 46 (3) of the Act of 1921) provides that the byelaws may be confined to ohildren other than those employed in specified occupations
and that exemption may he granted to individual children where the Looal Education -authority considers that circumstance-stances justify it.   Hitherto applications from Authorities for approval of byelaws extending the age limit from 14 to 15 (subject in most oases to exemption when employment is obtained) have been rejected&apos;mainly on financial grounds. The Board of Education have&apos; repeatedly refused even to entertain such proposals or to hold public .enquiries into their merits.    Such byelaws would, however; only apply to children-attaining the age of 14 in future and not to those who have already passed it.   There are, however, Educational objections to compelling children to remain in Public Elementary Schools until 15 which have been strongly represented by the Board of Education to Local Education Authorities. While the initiative-for extending the school age-to 15 rests in England and Wales with.-the Local Education Authorities4 in Scotland;,&apos; such extension could be effected by an Qs-der. of the Scottish Education Department fixing, an &quot;appointed .-&apos; day&apos;, for the purpose.   Legislation would, be required to raise the&apos; compulsory school leaving age to 16 in Great : Britain.OP      6.     Any.estir-ate of the cost of an extension to 15 of the:kg , - . t - -   ......     &apos; ,0-15. compulsory school leaving age must be   very speculative.Exclusive o.f the cost of maintenance allowances the maximum possible ultimate effect would-be for the whole&apos; Of Gre&amp;tBritain, 490,000 additional pupils costing  6,000,000-annually, of which  3,300,000 would fall on the taxes and- -.- 3,700,000 on the rates-7.;; -The maximum possible immediate effect ihlJfogriatfd ated Wales, only, would be an addition of 50,000 to 100,000
pupils in 19.24./25 and the cost would aggregate -(Taxes         is.tes        Total For 50,000 pxipils 345,000.    255,000       600,000For 100^000   &quot; 690,000.    510,000   1,200,000These figures may be subject to some slight reduction in respect of children proceeding direct to Secondary Schools and compulsory retention to ,15 would probably be qualified in working by   numerous.exemptions,for employment and domestic duties for which, paragraph 43 (d) of Education Act 1921 affords wide scope, and the figures may be liberally discounted on this account.     The figures would, of course, be greatly increased by the adoption of the policy of compulsory retention to 16. 8.     In connection with the proposal to allow looal authorities to exercise&apos; their existing statutory powers to raise the compulsory age limit to 15, the following considerations are worthy of note:-(l)   In so far as the proposal is one for relief of unemployment there will be a -strong demand from Looal Authorities that the whole extra cost should be borne by the Exchequer.   Apart from the financial consequences such a concession, if made, would   be a most embarrassing and undesirable precedent and siould In any case be rejected. (2)   The operation of the byelaw   can,if aLocal Education Authority likes, be limited to say 2 or 3 years, but it was certainly &apos; hot the intention of the section that the leaving age should-be raised to meet a temporary emergency, and if such action is once taken it will be difficult, if not
f 0 3impossible to insist against the wishes of a   Local Education Authority that&apos; itshoxild not be permanent.&apos;i $(3)   While only a comparatively few LooalEducation Authorities, (all of.these urban&apos;areas) have asked for the-extension it iscloak that in practice the concession couldnot be restricted to those Authorities orto areas where unemployment is&apos;severe.(4) In many areas and particularly&apos; in rural areas, the extension of the compulsoryage limit would be. highly unpopular.The retention of children:to the endof the term in whioh they reach the age of14 Is already resented in a good manyindustrial areas both by employers and parents;(5)   While there would be no serious administrativedifficulty in extending the age limit to 15there might, at the outset, be some delay in providing the requisite additional accommoda-tion and teaching staff,INSTRUCTION.      9*     While there would be no difficulty in giving :*children retained after 14 some amount of practical instruction it would, as stated above, be wholly impracticable to provide.special technical education for such children in the Public Elementary Schools.MAINTENANCE       10.   The grant of maintenance allowances to ALLOWANCES.children attending Elementary Schools (other than - children selected on grounds of ability endeducational promise&apos;as well as need) would be a
novelty.   Maintenance allowances of varying amounts are of course given to children in need of them attending Secondary Schools, such maintenance &apos;if allowances av&amp;rdge afcout  8 per&apos; head per annum.11.   If it is decided to raise the compulsory age limit to 15-and.-give; a maintenance, allowance, such allowance could.not., well be less than. 3/- a week (say,  8:0:0: per annum)... and clearly must be given to all children over 14 whether attending, voluntarily or compulsorily.   There are already about 150,000 :children between the age of 14 and 15 (some of them of oourse only slightly over 14) and about 11,000 over 15 still attending Public Elementary Schools in England and Wales voluntarily.   Altogether, there are about &apos; 300,000 children between 14 and 15 attending grant-aided day schools of,all kind in England and Wales.12.   Once conceded there would most certainly&apos;he pressure to extend the principle to younger-children and it is difficult to see how logically such. an extension could be resisted, in the case, at all events, of children over 12.COST OP 13.   The cost would depend to some extent on whetherMAIHTEiaUOE -    ,Air,5)WAlICES.      there was-any discrimination between necessitousandnon-necessitous parents, but taking the figure490,000. for.Great, Britain, as the maximum additionalnumber of pupils given by extension to 15, the costat  8 per head per annum would&apos; total  3,920,000.Houghly speaking there are 690,000 children in
eaoh year of Elementary School life under 14 so that the numbed of children aged 12 to 15 who might be eligible for maintenance allowances if the concession were extended would be 1,870,000 which at  8 a head would cost  14,960,000 per annum.14.   Ihe Committee are of opinion that maintenance allowances to children attending school should only be given, if at all, fcjr  or through the Looal Education Authority.   Most Authorities would certainly object strenuously to any , part of the heavy expense involved being cast on the rates, but unless the rates were charged with a substantial part of the cost the Authorities would have little or no incentive to eoonomy,   Apart from other grave objections a soheme of maintenance Allowances of the kind contemplated seems impracticable on the ground 9  costliness and Is wholly at variance with the principle on which such allowances have hitherto been given in connectionwith education,15,   After careful consideration of the difficulties indicated&apos; above the Committee   -have reached the following general conclusions *n the question raised in the first paragraph of their terms of reference:-
- mmShe compulsory extension of the Public Elementary School leaving age to 16 would require legislation, would be eostly and is educationally undesirable. Ihe extension of the compulsory leaving age to 15 could bb attained in England and Wales by tho approval of local Educa-tion authority byelaws under Section 8 (2) (Subject to provision for exemption under 8 (3)) of the Education Act 1918, and in Scotland by tho fixing of an Appointed Day, but in neither case could the extension bring back to school any child who had already left.   The principal objections to any such extension are indicated in f paragraph 8 above.     The proposal might ultimately cost about  6,000,000 or immed-iately about  1,000,000 per annum to rates -and taxes.It would involve a stf&amp;ing reversal of a declared policy whioh has been -i .officially defended on educational as well as financial grounds. Any proposal to give Maintenance Allowances to children Qompulaorily retained at school to 15 would be very expensive in itself, would probably have far more costly conse-quonoes and would neoessitate a complete departure from well established educational administrative-policy.   It would be most difficult, if not Impossible, to force- local Education Authorities to contribute financially and in this event the whole: cost would fall on tho Exchequer of a service, the conduct of whioh must heoss*
nocosaaflly be entrusted to tho Authorities. Should, howovor, the Cabinet regard tho provision of financial assistance in sue h haso as essential the Oommittoo aro -disposed to think that tho losst objectionable solution would bo found along tho linos .of an extension of tho Unomploy-ment Insurance 3 c he mo montionod in paragraphs 24-26 below.TOHIIB    16.     Another method of preventing do tori oration among MPLOYiiSHISHIRES-     unomployad boys and girls between ,tho ago of 14 and 18 is by moans of Juvenile Unemployment Centres, at which general education combined with as much practical, ins true-tie n as can bo arranged for is jjivon.     Direct vocational training is not seriously attempted at those Centres and tho Board of Education have throughout ho If- tho view that tho value of tho Centres must he judged by tho social rather than tho educational side of their activities. 17.-    At present a local Education Authority in whose area there is serious unemployment can sot up a Centre on the basis of paying 25 per cent of the cost, tho other 75 per oont boing &apos; borne by tho Exchequer through the Ministry of Labour.    Boys aha girls (between -16 and 18) in receipt of unemployment benefit aro required to attend tho Centre: other boys and girls, if unemployed may attend voluntarily. 18.-    The-present; financial arrangements wore first adopted between January end. June 1923,&apos; were . resumed- in September 1923, and are -to continue until April next.      In May 1923, the Centres rescued a maximum ox 89 with 8,610 children in attendance at any one time.&apos;    At present there ero about 75 Centres with about 6,500 children in attendance.   These comparatively small a umbers are mainly duo to tho fact that many looal Authorities, owing&apos; to heavy rates and reduction in education charges generally, are not, prepared to pay oven 25 per cent of the cost.&apos;
19.     t^j^exctve^^Brer^i^pt set up by the Board-of\lucution In tha perlcsIJLffiJseUd^t^^ armisticewhen 100 per cent, of the cost was paid by the Exchequer.&apos; The -figure-ajreached a maximum of 215 Centres open at bne time with 24,.?0O...ohilaren in attendance.   Subsequently the Exchequer - grant is as reduced to 50 per cent.   This reduction) combined with the improvement in trade and -reduction in out of work donation, resulted in the dwindling and closing of nearly all the Centres. 30.     If a 100 per cent Exchequer grant for the Centres were now to be given the effect would certainly be to expand them considerably.     It seems quite probable that the numbers of Centres and of children In attendance would be about trebled, the attendance thus being (say) 20,000 to 35,000 at any one time.     The whole coat at the present time (with the &apos;75 per cent grant) is&apos;at the rate of about  110,000 per annum;    the Cost with a 100 per cent grant might be put at between&quot; 500,000 and.  350,000 assuming the cost per head to remain the same as at present, but it may well be that with a 100 per cent grant this cost would be&quot;increased. 31;     The above estimate is bused on the assumption- that&apos;attendance is compulsory only for boys and girls between 16 and 18 and in receipt of benefit.     If by some means&apos; attendance were made compulsory for other unemployed hoys and girls between 14.and 18, the&apos;attendance ana consequently -tho host would be considerably increased,/ and might easily afeount-te between  500,000 and  600,000 per annum.,     - &apos;&apos; --&apos; (   - &apos; ! &apos;;     . &apos;&apos;:&apos;&quot;- . -. .&apos;;-&quot;23.     It maybe noted that the number of unemployed boys and girls between the &apos; ages&apos;&quot;of 14 and 18 is esti-/ffiated at - about 160,000 at the present time;    the iiWber
(between 16 and 18)-drawing benefit ia not more than 30,QQ0. 23.     The Committee;apprediate the objections which may.be :, raised to the policy of 100-per cent Exchequer Grant. Difficulties of control are&apos;- greatly&quot; increased - and complex central machinery&apos; -has to ce maintainod to guard against-;.local extravagance and waste.     Moreover/ a proposal&apos; to give- lbo per1 cent Grants might have -serious reactions in respect of other similar aided services and in this conhoetion, tho constant pressure   on the Exchequer to &apos;pay the&apos;whole&apos; cost&apos;-&apos; of education and tbiemploymeHt relief should be remembered. On the other hand the. Committee feel that the Centres have &apos; done good work in the past and that their extonsion and development affords a most hopeful-&apos;form of mitigation andone which comparatively speaking places -a small burden oni - .the taxpayer.24.     The Committee think that the Cabinet should considerwhether the need for extending the area covered by tho-Centres is so great as to out-weigh the serious financialobjections&quot;to the 100% grant; subject to this questionof poiioy the Committee racommend -  -(i)     That the Exchequer Grant,for juvemiloUnemployment Centres should bo increased as from&apos;1st -January&apos; 1924, &quot;-from 15 percent.-, to-100 par cent(ii)     That, with a view to..securing economy andefficionoy investigations should bo undertaken forthwith by tho Departments concerned with&apos; a view to seeing whether some per&apos; capita grant system could not bo osvised for she Centres which would olTiate the need for detailed&apos;   , -central control.
PROPOSE gg.    The Committee have considered, whether,   as an  T&amp;iSlOfl &quot;  &quot;&apos;OP UJShkPLOY-     alternative to cotcnoulsory attendance at school   it MM! ItfomUflCa &apos; &apos;SCHEME, might be practicable to extend the UnemploymentInsurance Scheme so as to cover juveniles between the ages of 14 and 16. &apos; M. present only juveniles aged .16 and over are covered by the scheme, and it is only in respect of these juvenileo that the Ministry of Labour (by making attendance at the Juvenile Unemployment Centres a condition of the receipt of Unemployment Insurance Benefit) can exercise pressure. It is true that gome children, below. 16 attend the Centres, but they do so voluntarily.&apos;There is no particular reason why the Unemploy-ment Insurance scheme should begin at 16 and not at 14, or at whatever may be the school-leaving ape. - A. change in the minimum Insurance age-, from 16 to 14would involve legislation.   Contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund (shared between the Employer and the juvenile in employment) would be payable-, but the amount per week would be small.   The contributions paid by those in employment would add to the revenue of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, would thus provide money to-anable Unemployment Insurance benefit (of appropriate amount), to be paid to those out of employment, and, (if considered advisable) might provide funds to defray the:cost of Centres which juveniles between the ages of 14 and 16 could be oousnelied to attend as a condition of the receipt of benefit.27-.   The Committee think this proposal requires more consideration than has been possible in the short time at their disposal, and do not recommend that the Cabinet should .reach any decision upon it at this stage.
ViiiDIlSS 2S.   Suggestions have been made-for providing youngOM 16j- 20.persons out of employment with courses of training in suitable sages somewhat analogous to those given to disabled ex-Service men unable to resume their old occupations, &amp;ny such scheme could not fail to be enormously expensive but apart from this would almost inevitably break down on the difficulty of finding suitable openings for the men when trained.     As an indication of this difficulty it may be noted that the Ministry of Labour have several thousand partly traineddisablej men now on their books for whom they are unable to obtain improverships in industry. 9,.   The only trade in which there is a known shortage of skilled labour is the building trade, this being due to the failure to recruit a prentices for a number of years. 50.-   The Committee understand that the Minister of Labour has recently been in communication, with the National Federation of Building Trades Employers and the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives with a view to the holding of a conference to consider the whole ques-lltion of apprenticeship in the various sections of the. building industry.   The Committee are informed that both organisations have expressed themselves as willing to attend such a conference and that the Minister of Labour had proposed to hold it early in the New Year.   The Committee are of opinion that this should be done. 51..   The Committee need not emphasize the difficulties of compelling youths aged 16 - 20 to attend courses of instruction nf any kind or the vast expense which would have to be incurred to provide - adequate maintenance during such instruction.   The objections to payment
&apos; 744to young juveniles of maintenance- allowances,indicated &quot; above apply with, if possible, even greater force to the older juveniles.32.  The Committee have indicated in paragraphs 16 to 23iabove their views as to the extension of Juvenile Unemployment Centres and it appears to them that these Centres provide the most hopeful solution of the problem.(Signed on behalf of the Committee)*y. goijwess,Chairman.R.B.
