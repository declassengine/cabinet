XEl^EAL^pI^SEASE. MBKOPAIffiUM. BY THE MINICGEER OP HEALTH.COP/ HOThere are certain points arising out of tbo Report of Lord Trovcthin&apos;s Committee of Inquiry on Vcneroal Disease on which I must consult my colleagues.I may explain that this Committee was appointed last year, on the initiative of Lord Dawson of Penn, by an impartial Committee of selectors of high standing in the world of medicino, &quot;to consider and report upon the best medical measures for preventing venereal disease in the civil community, having regard to administrative practicability including cost&quot;. The appointment of the Committee had the full support of Sir Alfred Mond, Minister of Health at the time.The question of venereal disease was receiving much public attention and there was great controversy between two bodies of opinion represented by the Medical Council for Combating Venereal Diseases and the Society for the Prevention of Venereal Disoase.    The first of these bodies received an annual subsidy from the Ministry of Health for propaganda work, and its policy is that which has been accepted by various Governments, boing based on the findings of the Royal Commission on Venereal Disease (1916).   The essentials of the policy arc to subsidise! local authorities in the establishment of venereal disease clinics at which free treatment is provided for persona suffering from or having reason to suppose they may have contracted venereal disease, and to keep steadily before the public, by measures of propaganda, the evil results of venereal disease ^nd the Importance of continence.  The second of the two bodies, bile not opposing the above policy, maintains that self-disinfoctlon 3 the only real way of dealing with the problem   and that proper Provision fdr this and education of the public as to it should
be adopted as a measure of public policy.One of the main objects of the Trevethin Committee -a body composed of medical men and women with a legal Chairman and Vice-Chairman - was to examine the views represented by the two rival organisations and to see whether any common ground could be discovered, sound.medically end practicable administra-tively.   In tho course of their enquiry, thoy: naturally considered the action which Is at present being taken to deal with venereal disease under the auspices of the&apos; Ministry of Health.The main point of difficulty regarding the Tr^vethin Report arises out of paragraph 14 which is as follows &apos;--&quot;14.   It must be remembered that to a large extents exposure to infection takes place in conditions in which prompt disinfection Is either difficult or can only be carried out at great disadvantage.     Further, the disinfection by a man of himself after exposure demands an effort and care which.the circumstances do not tend to promote.     It is urged by some that any system of disinfection would tend to increase the number-of exposures and to raise the disease rate.    We have received no evidence of facts in support of this view and we are inclined to think that those who hold it attach too much weight to the deterrant effect of the fear of disease.   But&apos;, however this may be, upon the evidence which we have heard, wo conclude that the success of any general public facilities for self-disinfection is likely in the civil community to be very small,     At the same, time, in face of the fact that disinfection in the case cf an individual if properly and promptly affected, will in all probability be successful, we do not think that there is any justification,fQr-deputy.n^obstaolesiiiini the w^y of individuals who desire to procure the necessary disinfectants.    The law does not to-day prevent the sale of sheaths, which afford by
mechanical means a measure of protection against venereal disease, and. we think that the law should be alteredso jxa to perii.it properly qualified chemists to sell ad hoc d 13 infect ants provided such disinf eot ants ^are^ sold in a form 9p&quot;roved and with instructions for use approved by some competent authority.    We suggest that the Medical Research Council should be invited to undertake this task,   We think however,i that^tho^cortingrcial advertisement of ad hoc dis Infect ants., should be prohibited,&quot;The terms of this paragraph and especially the words-underlined, seemed to be based on a theory of the existing law on the sale of self-disinfectants inconsistent with the view of the law previously taken by the Ministry of Health,     My predecessor accordingly consulted the Law Officers of the Grown and W.S advised to the effect that, under the existing law, a chemist, provided that he does not give any written or printed recommendations or instructions for use, can supply and orally recommend materials for the prevention of venereal disease, in reply to a general request for assistance or a specific request for a particular material and whether before or after intercourse from which infection la apprehended to be a possibility.   It will be seen that on this view of the existing law, the recommendation of tho Treyethin Committee, if taken by itself, Instead of removing obstructions in the way of obtaining self-disinfectants might rather increase them by restricting instructions or recommendations for their use to such as are approved by a competent authority.  The proposal! that self-disinfectants should only be sold in a form approved by such an authority is also rather restrictive than otherwise.The position stated in th^ preceding paragraph was explained by my predecessor to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Trevethin Committee, and they  xpnessed the view that whatever the existing law may bo, the essential thing is to
public recognition and regulation of the sale of self-disinfectants,If this vie If Is accepted, it becomes all the more Important to accept and carry out the other recommendations of the Trevethin Committee.   The main recommendations are as follows (1) Tho improvement and extension of some of the presentclinics, and the establishment of now clinics in a few centres of population at present unprovided for. (2) Additional hostels for women and girls suffering fromvenereal disease and further homes or hospitals for tho treatment of children. (3) Improved methods of treatment in poor law infirmaries * (4) Employment of trained social workers at venereal clinics. (5) Extension of education and propaganda.It is estimated that the carrying out of these measures will Involve an addition to the Exchequer grant for venereal disease, which now amounts to about  360*000 por annum, of  20,000 in tho next financial year and an ultimate addition of  40,000.(Intel.)
