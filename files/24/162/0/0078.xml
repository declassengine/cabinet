The Committee had under consideration, a memorandum by the Minister, of Agriculture and Fisheries [CP. 475 (23)1 which had been considered by the Cabinet earlier in the day (Reference;.Cabinet 58 (23) Conclusion 5).After hearing evidence is to the position with regard to the present outbreaks of disease and as to the difficulties attending research work on foot-and-mouth disease, the Committee came to the following conclusions: 1. Slaughter Pollti y.That unless sOme new factor arises, the present policy of slaughter should be continued, if necessary, until the net coat of that policy reaches  1^500,000, when the question will again be considered by the Committee, S. Finance.-That the Ministry of Agriculture should continue to draw on the 1x30al Taxation Accohrit for payments of compensation etc.    The Committee recommend, however, that the Local Taxation Account should be recouped by ah Exchequer Grant to the extent of half the net expenditure.    A supplementary estimate will have to be introduced into Parliament for this purpose. 3, Salvage.Owing to the shortage of butchers in the Cheshire and Shropshire area, it ia becojfiiflg   increasingly difficult to arrange for the immediate slaughter of affected and contact animals.    The Committee, therefore, agreed that in this area salvage of contact animals should be abandoned for the time being, the carouses of all slaughtered, animals being immediately destroyed.    This would permit of the slaughter of animals being undertaken by persons other than skilled butchers and v;ould considerably accelerate slaughter.    The usual procedure as regards salvage is to be resumed as soon as practicable. .Rumane Killer.The humane killer should be used wherever possible,
but where, butchers Insist Qn using the pole-axe and it is impossible to obtain the services of other butchers who sill use the humane killer, slaughter by means of the pole-axe will have to be sanctioned, 5. Research,The Committee considered that it was desirable that the Ministry of Agriculture should call in an eminent scientist to investigate their present methods of research in regard to the disease, and it was decided, that the Minister of Agriculture should ask Sir Walter Fletcher, the Secretary o  the British Medical Research Council, to suggest the names of two or three scientists for the purpose.
