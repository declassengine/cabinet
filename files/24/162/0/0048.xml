[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]        41Printed for the1 Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1923.SECRET. C.P.-448 (23). .(AhoC.[,D.m-B.) I. 13COMMITTEE  OF   IMPERIAL   DEFENCE.FOOD SUPPLY IN WAR.(Previous C.I.D. Papers, Nos, 113-5, 133-5, 134-5, 135-5, 151-5, 182-5, 187-5, 441-5, 442-5, 444-5, 445-5, 451-5, 456-5, 458-5, and Conclusion (5) at 177th Meeting.)Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE first thing is to ascertain what stock of wheat actually in this country we may rely upon at the outbreak of war. For this purpose it is necessary to take for the stock available the lowest figure that may reasonably be apprehended. According to the figures of the Board of Agriculture, at the normal rate of consumption this figure may be taken to be seven weeks&apos; supply. It is, they intimate, most unlikely to fall below this even in the months of April or May, which are the worst periods in the year. Supposing war restrictions on food-which I need not say include the dilution of wheat flour-were at once imposed upon the outbreak of. war, this seven weeks could only be prolonged to ten weeks. A more favourable view, no doubt, is suggested by the assumption which is made by some authorities that, as soon as relations become strained to the point of a threat of immediate -war, we may exnect a tendency, by the agency of the Government or otherwise, at the last moment&apos;to rush extra food into the country. No doubt this might be the case, but it would hardlv be wise to rely upon it, in the first place because the actual catastrophe might occur with unexpected suddenness; in the second place because it might be possible for the hostile power, in anticipation of war, to hamper the export of wheat from one of our main sources of supply, either being that Power&apos;s own country, or perhaps some other country over which it has diplomatic control; and in the third place because even in the case of friendly countries., in the cireum-stances contemplated of war immediately impending, there might be a tendency to prohibit the export of wheat as a precaution. On the whole, therefore, it would be wise not to take death-bed-repentance supplies into account, and the safe course is not to put the minimum stock as larger than would suffice for ten weeks&apos; supply even under war restriction conditions. Would ten weeks&apos; supply be a sufficient margin 1 The answer depends, in the first instance, upon the anticipated effects of submarine warfare. &quot;The Admiralty have given us a confident opinion that by the end of the first three months they would have dominated the submarine attack. lNO doubt, even with submarines at -their worst, some addition to the ten weeks&apos; stock would get through, and, further, assuming the Admiralty to be correct, by the end of ten weeks, the loss of shipping and, therefore, the interference with food imports would be greatly reduced, even though the enemy&apos;s submarines were not completely dominated for two or three weeks more; so that the margin of a ten weeks&apos; supply would seem to be sufficient. But before this conclusion is accepted two considerations must be borne in mind. In the first place is it reasonable to count upon there being in the next war no improvement in the art of commerce destroying ? After all, the late war was fertile in surprises, bpth in weapons and methods, on both sides. Have we reached the limit of human ingenuity in commerce destroying ? ^o doubt in time-perhaps in a short time the new ingenuity would be met by counter-ingenuity, and counter-measures would be hit upon which would effectively [10853J
respond to any such new method of attack. But we may not be able to afford the time necessary for this counter-development, and so the destruction of food imports may be effectively carried on for more than ten weeks, and we may be starved into defeat. In the second place, the attack upon our food may not depend upon submarines at all, but may consist of depriving us of our sources of supply, if we take the three possible enemies which we have to consider-Japan, France and United States the danger to our food supply from Japan would be relatively small affecting the Far Eastern supply alone, which could easily be replaced; the danger from France again would only be a submarine danger, with which I have already dealt; but the danger from the United States would be an attack upon our sources of supply. Obviously, in a war with the United States, we should lose the United States supply. But not only this : we should also lose the Canadian supply, since the American forces would no doubt immediately dominate the Canadian railway system. This would mean the loss of 43 per cent, of our present total supply. Could this be made good from elsewhere? I believe India is an uncertain source. I suppose extra supplies from the Australasian Dominions could be made available but could these be organised in order to be effective within ten weeks ? The Board of Agriculture doubt it. If not, we should have to look only to certain European countries and to South America. The agricultural situation in Russia is said to be improving and the Soviet Government is anxious to restore the export trade in wheat. In a few years Eussia may become a factor in the solution of the problem. Some contribution also from South-Eastern Europe may be antictipated. But these resources can hardly, by themselves, be counted on as adequate. As regards South America, I gather from the Admiralty, that we should have nothing to fear in a war with . United States from their submarines attacking our South American trade. If I have rightly understood the Admiralty, then it would seem that even if we lose the North American supplies, in addition to a possible European contribution, so long as we retain the Command of the Sea, we can make good a substantial part of the deficiency from South America. The answer, however, still leaves me with a certain misgiving. Argentina would probably have many other urgent customers, and, in any case, the Board of Agriculture say, she would not make good as much as the 43 per cent, deficiency. Moreover, even if we may rely upon our Navy being, ship for ship, superior to the Navy of the United States for in numbers we are limited by the Washington Agreement-is it certain that we could vindicate that superiority over the whole route, from South America to these shores, within ten weeks ? Lastly, I suppose we must not leave out of account the possibility that the United States might have sufficient political control over the Argentine as for a time to prevent food supplies to us from them. That would mean a loss to us), not of 43 per cent., but of 63 per cent, of our present supply, and if we are to con-template these possibilities-although, they are admittedly very unlikely to occur the argument for a larger stock than ten weeks&apos; supply of wheat in this country cannot be entirely dismissed, if there is any practicable method of providing it. &apos;       &apos; iSupposing this extreme case is to be contemplated. I proceed to enquire what means there are of increasing the stock of wheat held in this country. First let us suppose that financial inducements are held out to farmers to cultivate a larger acreage of wheat. The Board of Agriculture &quot;calculate that even if this were to have as large an effect as the emergency measures of the war had, at the outside we could not expect to increase the stock at the period when it reaches its minimum by more than one week&apos;s supply, and probably it would not amount to anything like so much. The calculation depends upon taking the maximum amount of extra wheat produced in a whole year by the emergency measures of the war and dividing that amount by five, one-fifth being the proportion of the full wheat supply grown in this country remaining over in the spring of each year. The meagre figure which I have given is the result.It would seem therefore that the stimulation of wheat cultivation would be of little avail, and that there is no method of substantially increasing the stock except by storage. If it could be contrived that overseas wheat must be stored in this country for a certain number of weeks or months before it is put upon the market, it seems to follow that at any given moment we should have in stock in this country that number of weeks&apos; or months&apos; supply of overseas wheat available. From figures supplied by the Board of Agriculture, it is calculated that the storage of imported wheat for two months would represent a minimum reserve of 27 million hundred-weights that is, ten weeks&apos; supply. It must, however, be remembered that a portion of this is a part of the seven weeks&apos; minimum supply, the foundation figure upon
which we are working, and the extra wheat to be accumulated by storage must be calculated at not more than another seven weeks or thereabouts. In other words, bv two months&apos; storage we should double the minimum stock of wheat in this country at the worst period of the year. Or, expanding it as we did in the first instance by means of food restriction measures, we shall get in all some twenty weeks&apos; supply. I need not say that for this purpose flour must be treated in the same way as wheat.It will, be asked what would be the cost of such a system? In the Report of the Royal Commission of 1904 it was calculated that the storage of wheat, when every-thing was taken into account, would cost not more than 4s. per quarter per annum. Supposing the cost in these days to have gone up by 50 per cent., then we should have the figure of 6s. a quarter per annum, with something more for interest on the capital value of the wheat for the time it is held up. From this basis the cost per quarter for two months can be arrived at. I presume that these figures might be taken to be the same whether the stores were built by the State and a rent charged, or it were left to private enterprise to supply the buildings itself. It should be noted that the storage methods which were suggested to the Royal Commission were more elaborate than is here described, and that something less simple might turn out to be necessary if the expedient is to be- resorted to at all. In any case there would be many details, for which provision would have to be made; as, for example, upon the question whether compulsory storage should apply all the year round or only during the months preceding the lean period of the year a distinction which would materially affect the total cost but enough has been said to show the broad limits of any such plan.Would such a plan be practicable, and if practicable, is the risk sufficiently great to make it worth while ? The answer may be summed up as follows: The risk would only arise, in the case of an unanticipated development of commerce destroying on a considerable scale, or in the case of a war with America, and would only last-unless America controlled the Argentine-until extra supplies from the latter and from the East could be organised. The answer therefore to the question as to the risk is that the risk is small. As to the practicability, there would seem to be no possible remedy except storage, and storage which would handicap, in time of peace, the smooth and cheap distribution of wheat would, I imagine, at the present moment be exceedingly difficult to provide and unpalatable to the public.(Initialled)        S.November 8,1923.
