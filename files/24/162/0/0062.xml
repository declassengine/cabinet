This document is the property of His Britannic majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 4=62 (23).THE CABINET.proposed anglo-french battle memorial at amiens.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.g I think my colleagues should be made acquainted with certain negotiations which are going on with regard to a joint Anglo-French^memorial to be erected at Amiens. In my private capacity I have been connected with a Committee in England to assist a French Committee whose Chairman is M. Klotz, ex-Minister of Finance, to raise funds for a joint Anglo-French memorial to be erected as a tribute to those who fell at the Battle of the Somme. As far as the collection of funds in England was concerned, we raised about  4,000, which has been handed over to M. Klotz. While this movement was in progress I ascertained that the Imperial War Graves Commission was also seeking to erect a memorial at Amiens as a monument to the missing who fell in the Battle of the Somme, but they were being1 considerably hampered in their work by the fact that the site which had been suggested for their memorial is almost precisely the same site as that on which the monument of the private Committee was to be erected, and that this was almost an insurmountable obstacle to the Imperial War Graves Commission^ monument being erected.I took the opportunity of M, Klotz&apos; being in London to interview him on the subject and the matter was thoroughly discussed between us, Sir Fabian Ware on behalf of the Imperial War Graves Commission being present. A suggestion has been made that, instead of what I will call M. Klotz&apos; memorial being an international one, the money subscribed both in France and England should be handed over to the French Government and that the French Government and the Imperial War Graves Commission together should erect a joint Government memorial. In my opinion this would be a very happy solution. We should get over the difficulties of site and an international memorial would be more impressive to future generations than two memorials erected in the one case by private enterprise, and in the second case by the Imperial War Graves Commission. M. Klotz is sounding his Government, but meanwhile I should like to know what my colleagues feel on the subject. There are so many important matters for the Cabinet to decide that I hesitate at the present moment to bring it before them, but, perhaps, if any of my colleagues regard the proposal with disfavour, he would be good enough to let me know privately. If no definite opposition be expressed, I will continue the negotiations, and then bring the matter officially before the Imperial War Graves Commission, and obtain the opinion of the other Governments concerned. If any definite proposal is approved, the matter would then be dealt with through the proper official channels.The joint memorial, if erected, would be of a non-sectarian character, and it would have the names of the British missing engraved upon it. Both these latter points are of importance to the Imperial War Graves Commission, and would be respected in the French scheme.D.loth November, 1923.(b23/238)   100   11/23  w o.p.   1081
