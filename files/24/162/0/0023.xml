TfTTS DOOUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.MILK PRICES AND THE MILK COMBINE.MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.The Report of the Linlithgow Committee on Milk Prices, Issued in April, 1923, cannot be ignored.The importance of the question to the health of the country Is summed up in paragraph 142 as follows:-&quot;Finally, we have received abundant evidenoe that the consumer is influenced more by prices than by statements of dietetic values. Hence lower prices mean more milk consumed.     The average consumption of milk by a large proportion of the infants and children in this country is authoritatively stated to be entirely inadequate to physiological needs,   Taking the population as a whole, the per capita   consumption of liquid milk is estimated to be less than half of that obtaining in other progressive countries such as the United States.   We have been informed that a decrease in price of Id. a quart results In an increase in consumption of as much as 15 to 20 per cent., and hence any such inoreased consumption compensates distributors by reducing the quantity of surplus milk to be manufactured at a loss.   Any effective increase in consumption per head should also tend to cheapen the unit cost of delivery&quot;.Under the agreement between the National Farmers&apos; Union and the National Federation of Dairymen&apos;s Associations in September, 1922, the price paid to the farmer for liquid milk delivered in London was:-SEOREt.O.P. 423 (23).
Ootoben 19S2 - Maroh, 1923 - l/8 per gallon,April, 1923 - September, 1923 - l/- per gallon.This was retailed to the consumer atOctober, 1922 - Maroh, 1923 - 8d. per quart - 2/Sper gallon,April, 1923 - September, 1923 - 6d. per quart a 2/-per gallon.The distributive margin in the London area and many other parts of the country was roughly 4d, per gallon to the whole-aalerand 8d. to the retailer = l/- per gallon; that Is to say the distributors received exactly as much for the distribution of milk as the farmers received In the Summer for producing it.The Committee reported that the margin of 4d. per gallon to the wholesaler was in their opinion excessive, that the margin of 8d, per gallon to the London retailer was not excessive for the small retailer whose sole trade is in liquid milk, but that the United Dairies (the Milk Combine) could retail milk cheaper by reason of their superior organisation, though to do so would ultimately drive out the small retailer.It may be observed however that this result postulates continued Inefficiency and absence of combination among the small traders.The United Dairies, Limited, was formed in 1915 with a capital of a million pounds, for the purpose of acquiring Borne of the principal London wholesale   milk businesses and their oountry oreameries.     In 1917 the Company decided to enter the London retail milk business, and some of the largest milk distributing businesses were acquired.   To enable this transaction to be completed the issued oapital was Inoreased to about  2,300,000.   In 1920 the issued oapital had reaohed  3,280,000, through the absorption of numerous other companies and private traders, and to-day the issued oapital stands at
approximately  4,000,000,The United Dairies sell 65$ of the wholesale and   Z0ft of the retail milk supply of London,   They are the dominant force in the National Federation of Dairymen&apos;s Associations through whose members 95$ of London milk is supplied.   They therefore control the London prices, and other distributors have to follow their lead.   But their influenoe is not confined to the metropolis.   It is hardly too muoh to say that it is the dominating factor in milk prices in the Home Counties and still further afield.   Other distributors can in no way be said to provide effective competition against the Milk Combine.   The Combine tolerates them because, in the words of the Committee, they provide effeotive &quot;cover from fire&quot; and &quot;cover from view&quot; for its&quot;operations.   By reason of their inferior organisation the small Distributors, can only retail milk at higher prioes and the United Dairies is content to let them oontirrue to do this, taking a bigger profit for itself.The position is explained by the Committee in paragraphs 100 to 107 of their Report which are reproduced in the Appendix to this memorandum.In effect the Committee report that the United Dairies in the half-year ending 30th September, 1922, made a profit at the rate of 13$ per annum on their nominal capital, but this bears no relation to their real profit, which is disguised by watered oapital, subsidiary oompanles, etc. They accordingly recommend the introduction of legislation to compel holding companies which stand in a similar position to file with their annual returns particulars from which their real profits could be ascertained.
&amp;- ti? &apos;:&amp;The Committee draw a striking contrast between the costs In Glasgow and in London.     In Glasgow the distributive margin instead of being 1/- per gallon asin London was 9d, per gallon (3-ld. to the wholesaler and5fd. to the retailer).   The Committee conclude, inparagraph 138:-&quot;Por this reason we consider that the charge for distribution in future is oapable of marked reduction from the nominal sum of Is. per gallon which Is at present operative in London and other places, and where the nominal margin may be less, proportionate reductions should be made.   We have already expressed our view that the wholesale portion of the distributive margin is, in any event, unduly high in cases where it amounts to as much as 3-gd. and 4d, per gallon,   fle consider; therefore, that, so far as London is concerned and on the assumption that the residuary retail margin of 8d. is not capable of immediate reduction -though in Glasgow a margin of 5^d. appears to suffice for that purpose - nothing less than a substantial reduction of the wholesale portion of the margin will meet the case in future having regard to the changed conditions.&quot;In view of the findings of the Committee, on July17th last, in conjunction with the Minister of Health,the Minister of Agriculture, the Secretary for Scotlandand the Minister of Labour, I called a conference atwhich representatives of the milk distributive trade andthe National Farmers&apos; Union met us.   At this conference thewhole field of the CommitteeTs Report was discussed. Iinvited the distributors to make some proposals In regardto the reduction of the retail price of liquid milk;   andI called attention to the arguments adduced by the CommitteeThe United Dairies, after an Ineffective attempt to showthat the Glasgow services were inefficient, fell back on ageneral traverse of the findings of the Committee and ablank refusal to disclose any particulars of their accounts,coupled with a somewhat hypocritical appeal to the Interestsof the small trader. &quot;With the approval of my colleagues,I warned the Combine that failure on their part to make
substantial reductions in price-, would probably necessitate the introduction of legislation. IThere the matter rested until the time came for the renewal of the agreement between the National Farmers&apos; Union and the Distributive Trade, by which milk prices are fixed from 1st October to 50th September each year.   As a result of negotiations, the Joint Committee of Producers and Distributors arrived at an agreement under whioh the public will pay ^d. a quart Issb for milk during the coming Winter than they paid last Winter.   The farmer is to be paid for milk delivered in London during October, November, and Maroh, ls.Bd. per gallon^ for December, January, and February ls,6d., while the retail price for the former period is to be ?d. per quart, and 8d. per quart for the latter.   In the six summer months it was decided that the price to the producer should be Is. per gallon, and that the retail price ehould&quot;be 6d. per quart. This is a much smaller redaction in price than the Linlithgow Committee suggested could be borne by the distributors alone, and 75^ of the cost of it is foisted upon the farmers.   This ie directly flounting the Linlithgow Committee and the Government and, in my opinion, is a bad case of a middleman&apos;s trust squeezing both the producer and the consumer in a vital article of food.It is not too much to say that the allegation which caused The Minister of Agriculture to appoint the Linlithgow Committee has been proved.   A distributive Combine which refuses to publish its accounts admits making a profit of 13$, on a capital generally understood to be watered, while on the other hand, agriculture is making no such profit and the public are unable to afford the amount of milk that national health requires.
I do not believe that public opinion will tolerate the continuance of this, and I think that the Government should adopt the recommendation of the Linlithgow Committee and force the Milk Combine to disclose its accounts,   Legisla-tion directed against trusts is notoriously difficult to make effective, but I have had the matter examined in my Department;   and I am satisfied that we can introduce a Bill that would achieve something in the direction desired. The draft, of which I attach a copy, empowers the Board of Trade to require any company dealing in the distribution of milk to furnish particulars as to the situation of their subsidiary companies and the nature and extent of their interest therein.    It empowers the Board of Trade to call for particulars as to the  quantity and cost price of milk purchased, expenses of distribution and the quantities and sale price of the milk sold, with similar powers in regard to the disposal of &quot;surplus&quot; milk for manufacture.    Finally, the draft empowers the Board of Trade to put a chartered accountant in to investigate the holding or subsidiary companies&apos; books so that a report may he made as to the exact costs and profits of the business.The Bill is entirely confined in its scope to milk. The case for legislation with regard to this commodity is established on the facts;   and I think that we should be on strong ground in confining legislation of such a drastic character to cases where actual investigation has shown such a course to be necessary.    As the Industry is not in competition with foreign countries the question of dis-closure of information to rivals abroad does not arise.If it be asked what benefit the Government hope to gain from the Bill the answer is that it is extremely desirable that in such a vital commodity as milk the public
should be placed in possession of the full facts as to its distributive costs.    Full disclosure of accounts when required will in itself benefit producer and consumer. The disclosure of actual cost and profit will show the consumer to what extent he is being overcharged and the producer to what extent he is being bled.     It will strengthen the producer in negotiation and stimulate co-operation among farmers.    The force of public opinion should itself be enough to make the Combine take action and relieve us from the necessity of imposing a form of control or municipalisation.I&apos;therefore ask for authority to Introduce in the Autumn Session a bill on the general lines of the attached draft, the precise details to be settled by the Home Affairs Committee.(Intld.)     P.L1.-G.2 0th October, 1923 .
APPENDIX.Paragraphs from the Idnlithgow Report dealing with the Milk Combine.A dividend equal to 9,36 per cent, on its total issued capital - Ordinary and Preference - was paid by the United Dairies for the financial year ended the 30th June, 1922. This dividend of course ignores undistributed profits;   the Issued capital is partly represented by goodwill and benefit of contracts.    We have not been Informed what was the precise amount originally represented by this goodwill and benefit of contracts, but it must have borne a very high proportion to the working assets.     Our examination of the accounts submitted for the half-year ended 30th September, 1922. shows that the total combined profits (milk and other goods) earned by the wholesale and retail groups of subsidiary milk businesses were at the rate of approximately 13 per cent, per annum on the capital invested therein, including the balance of goodwill, etc.   For various reasons, the period under review was, we understand, relatively unsatisfactory from a profit-earning standpoint.     It Is, therefore, impossible to draw definite conclusions from an examination of these accounts, particularly owing to the far-reaching effect of seasonal variations on trading results.     It is instructive to note, however, that -Id. per gallon yields a profit of 6 per cent, on the capital invested by the Company in the milk business at the present time.There is admittedly an element of danger in the con-tinuance of the present arrangement under which the control of so large a proportion of the milk supply of London is vested in one concern.   We observe, for instance, that the provincial wholesale company of the United Dairies appears to act, in some cases, as the channel for the milk bought by the subsidiary&apos; companies for manufacture into such products as condensed milk, and that no charge is made to the manufacturing companies for fixing up the contracts, bookings, and any other services which may be rendered.   Similarly, we observe that, as in the case of many other milk concerns, the proportion of the total expenses of the Oompany&apos;s retail businesses charged to the sale of &quot;other goods&quot;, which, are, in some cases, the Company1s own manufactured articles, is less than, in our view, the circumstances warrant. These may not be matters of paramount importance, and, in any case, they are questions of internal regulation which lie entirely within the discretion of the parent undertaking.   They illustrate, however, the obvious possibilities of the system of amalgamating industry by the formation   of &quot;holding&quot; companies.In this case, the system affords an opportunity for the Company, at the expense of the consumer of liquid milk, to place its own manufactured article on the market at less cost and, therefore, if it so desires, to dispose of it at a cheaper rate than is possible for competitive products.   No doubt this would be a sound business arrangement, the effect of which, in course of time, would be to drive other manufacturers out of the market.   We find, however, that as regards condensed milk, these manufacturers are the Company&apos;s main competitors for the farmers&apos; milk in certain districts, and their disappearance would, therefore,   react unfavourably on producers generally, while enabling the Company to extend its ramifications and to fortify its already predominant position in the milk trade generally.
The illustrations we have quoted imply that, with a more equitable adjustment, of oosts, the return derived by the Company from the liquid milk trade alone would be greater than it is at present.   We have no doubt that this is so.   It follows, therefore, that the Company could have retailed milk at a some-what cheaper average rate than that which prevailed during 1922. Other retailers would, however, have been compelled to do the same, and, if the wholesale pnoe of milk had been maintained, this course would have tended to drive out of business the small independent trader dealing in milk alone who works on the edge of the profit margin, and who relies on the wholesaler for his supplies.We fully appreoiate the reluctance of the Company to take any action that would lead to this result.   It has long been customary for large business amalgamations to seek to preserve, in their own interests, the small trader whose operative costB are necessarily heavy in relation to the volume of his business. He ensures for the big combination both &quot;cover from view&quot; and &quot;cover from fire&quot;.   It is true that he is usually left the least remunerative portion of the trade, and that his continued existenoe seems to be satisfying to publio opinion, but to imagine that he is effective as a competitive agent is fallacious. Further, in so far as the distribution of milk is concerned, it is arguable that he represents an unnecessary investment both of capital and labour in the milk trade generally.We foresee the possibility, therefore, that in course of time, the public demand for a cheaper milk supply may lead to the disappearance of the smaller trader.   While this would correspondingly strengthen the position of all large milk businesses in London, it would obviously react most effectively in favour of the United Dairies,   In these circumstances, and having regard to the virtual monopoly already enjoyed by the Company in the London wholesale trade, which, of itself, must enable it to control indirectly consumer&apos;s prices generally in the London area, it would appear desirable that the consuming public should be able readily to ascertain whether the price charged by the Company for fresh milk is, at any time,inflated by the cost of auxiliary services rendered to its subsidiary under-takings, or by a higher rate of net profit than may be considered reasonable.   Indeed, the Company may, in its own interests,desire to increase publio confidence by supplying information, from time to time, on these fundamental points.We do not oonslder that the situation warrants any such expedients as the nationalisation or municipalisation of supplies, or the formation of Publio Utility Undertakings, We are, however, impressed by the fact that the formation of companies intended mainly to hold the securities of and receive dividends from merged companies results in considerable obscurity as to the precise financial position of the associated undertakings. In the case of the United Dairies, for instanoe, the whole of the Bhare capital in the subsidiary companies is held by the parent company, and, as it largely finances the operations of these companies, the share capital of the subsidiary companies cannot be taken to indicate the actual amount invested in the respeotive concerns. As private companies within the meaning of the Companies (Con-solidation) Act, 1908, the Balanoe Sheets of the subsidiary companies are not required to be filed at Somerset House, and, as they were not included among the accounts submitted for our information, they are, therefore, not available for reference.
The Balance Sheet of the parent Company, which has to be filed, gives no information as to the book-value of the good-will, the amount paid for benefit of contracts, the fixed and floating assets, or the amount of the liabilities, reserves, and undistributed profits standing in the books of the subsidiary undertakings ,   We understand that the sums paid for goodwill vary, but that the original companies coming into the amalgamation were acquired on the basis of 5% years&apos; purchase of the average adjusted profits.   It will be realised that the value placed on goodwill and other intangible assets has a bearing on the profits required to be earned in order to maintain dividends, and these have to. be provided out of the margin between the price paid to the producer and that paid by the consumer.107. We, therefore, recommend that the Government should consider the advisability of introducing legislation to require holding companies which Btand in a position similar to that of the United Dairies to file with their annual returns at Somerset House, a co-ordinated Balance Sheet showing inter alia how much of their capital is represented by (a) goodwill and other intangible assets, (b) fixed assets and (c) floating assets, and the aggregate amounts of their (d) liabilities, (e) reserves and (f) profits.-
