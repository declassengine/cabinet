BfflHISIS MS) THfe., GBHBBAL ELECTIONWhile there appears still to be a scarcity of money for ordinary party work at the communist he ad quarters, Bpeoial grants, far in excess of the usual weekly amounts have been sont to District Party organisers:     the position is explained in a confidential communication sent to the Manchester District Organiser on November 21st, the text of which is as follows:&quot;The Central Executive Committee has again had under consideration the question of the stoppage of tho weekly grants to the District Party Committees. The decision to stop the grants, as you are aware, takes effect at the end of this week.&quot;When the decision to stop the grants was first made by the Executive it was based upon the critical finanoial condition of the party and the absolute necessity of reducing Party expenditure to a bedrock minimum as the only means of carrying on until the end of the year.   So far as the general funds of the party are ooncerned there haa been no improvement in the situation since the decision was made, and the central Executive Committee has had no option but to oonfirm that deoision to take effect from the end of this week, Tho payment that will be sent you on Friday, therefore, is the last payment that should be expeoted for the remainder of the year,   when it is in the position to do so, the Central Committee will review the whole situation in the light of its probable income for next year, and if it is at all possible, the Distriot Party Committees may rest assured that every effort will be made to renew: the grant with the beginning of the year.&quot;Since the decision to stop the grants was made, however, a new situation has arisen and we are now in the midst of a general election.   This will Involve additional tasks of the Party both in the districts as well as at headquarters and in the looalitios, and to meet its finanoial obligations in* connection with the election the Central Executive Committee is taking steps to raise a special fund.   In addition to the tasks which devolve upon the Party in connection with the speoifio candidaturea for v&amp;Ioh we are responsible, it is also necessary that every effort should be made to mobilise Party foroea in the constituencies generally for affective Party work during the election campaign.   It is more than ever essential that the Party organisation in the districts should be maintained for this purpose, and we think we are justified in charging the election fund we are raising, with a sum that will enable U3 to make a small grant to the D.P.CS..&quot;This deoiaion has been made by the Central Executive Committee, and in accordance therewith I am asked to sand the enclosed special contribution of  15 to your D.P.C. from the Parliamentary fund.&quot;Amounts/
-*   -*Amounts sent to other organisers, with a similarcommunication, on the saae date-, were:Glasgow  15South Wales  10TyneBide  7.10.0.Birmingham  7.10.0*Although there is no proof it is extremely probablethat grants of at least  7.10.0. have been sent to thefive other organisers.In a circular dated Hovember 20th and headed &quot;GeneralElection Fund&quot;, the committee in charge of funds for theparliamentary Committee of the Coranunist Party (consistingof Albert Inkpin, W.T. Colyer and Nellie Lansbury, notGeorge Lansbury, as reported last week) stated that:&quot;We urge upon you to make special efforts on behalf of the General Election fund.   Circulate the enclosed collecting cards;   hold special meetings;   get pledges from individual members;    arrange entertainments, etc., and sand us the proceeds.&quot;The present political crisis is of supreme importance to the workers.    She boss class is deliberately testing the strength and spirit of the working class organisations.   At suoh a time the communists - tip on whom rests the responsibility of giving a fighting load to the entire movement    must make ever greater sacrifices than hitherto.&quot;Newbold in Mo the rwe II, Willie Gall ache r in Dundee, Geddes in Gresnook, Joe Vaughan in Betbnul Green, Sakl&amp;tvala in Bat terse a, W* Paul in Rusholme, and other Party candidates adopted, must be given the support they need to enable them to carry the workers1 standard into the heart of the enemy7s camp.&quot;Our party must also take its part in the struggle against the -massed forces of capitalism in other constituencies.&quot;We ask every nsmber to do his utmost in this cause.   We know that we shall not get the thousands of pounds that could profitably be spent, but it is absolutely essential that you should raise the sum ne ceesary To&quot;meeY&quot;t1ie minimum expenditure to which we are pledged^&quot;The issue of &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; dated November 23rd contains the Communist Party election manifesto,   the main points of which are given below:ECONOMIC/
&quot;FOREIGN/&quot;The State should take control of ell land and factories to organise production so as to provide employment for all and produce what is needed,&quot;Workers&apos; Control Commissions to be established in every factory, with powers of investigating the financial and commercial activities of the employers, and participating in the management of the individual enterprises, controlling overtime, etc.&quot;All idle factories to be requisitioned by the State without compensation.&quot;All land allowed to fall out of cultivation to be requisitioned by the state without compensation, and credits provided for the development of agricultural production.&quot;All export and import trade to be conducted undor tho direction of the State, to regulate them in accordance with home needs and production.&quot;State control of credits and banks.&quot;Capital levy - not to redeem debt, but for social purposes.&quot;Suspension of interest payment on the NationalDebt above holdings of a specific figure.&quot;Abolition of indirect taxation.&quot;All income in excess of a living standard to be taxed to its full value.&quot;SOCIAL HBMANDS&quot;A National Minimum wage of      a week.&quot;Maintenance at the national minimum, payable by the State Exchequer, for all unemployed workers until work is found for them, and for all sick and aged workers, the same to be administered through the Trade Unions.&quot;A six hour day to increase production, by absorbing tli3 work of all.&quot;Housing: - Sufficient accommodation for all to be immediately put in hand.

No credits for armaments orwar.&quot;Empire:   Complete liberation from British dominion of all subject races.&quot;These are the measures immediately necessary to deal with the present crises at home and abroad,&quot;To these measures we must bind every Labour candidate.&quot;The struggle for these measures is a stage in the struggle for Socialism.   These measures are not themselves Socialism.   They can be carried out in the frame of the existing Capitalist State.&quot;But they can only be carried out in the face of implacable capitalist-opposition.   Therefore only a Labour. Government, based on the working class and responsible to it, can and must carry out tnesa measures as soon as it comes to power.      Therefore our immediate object in the present struggle must be the establishment of a Labour Government.   But that Labour Government must base itself on the support and confidence of the masses of the working class, and be prepared to strike unhesitating blows in the interests of the working olass.&quot;CONFISCATION OF ALL IDLE FACTORIES AND LAND.&quot; 4 A WEEK MINIMUM WAGE - A 6 HOUR WORKING DAY.&quot;FULL MAINTENANCE FOE ALL UNEMPLOYED.&quot;HOUSING FOR ALL.&quot;VOTE LABOUR AND COMMUNIST.

5 -659On November 20th the General secretary addressed thefollowing circular to all Distribution Committees:&quot;The coming fortnight before the General Election offers an opportunity for propaganda which we cannot affort &apos;to neglect.   Now is the time to prove the Distribution machinery which we have been trying to build up for the last year;   now is the time to rope in those members who fight shy of Distribution work in normal times.&quot;Canvassing for Labour Candidate.   Your experience in house to house &quot;Canvassing wTllTbe very valuable In canvassing for your local Labour candidate.   We suggest that where possible, you should undertake the entire canvassing of a certain area (e.g. one ward);   thus you will gain a knowledge of the extent of Labour sympathy in that area, and, if you could compile a list of the names and addresses of those voting Labour, it would be of great use to you in future Distribution work.&quot;Special Numbers of the Workers&apos; Weekly..    Tho next two Issues of&quot;Tile&apos; paper 7NoV.H^ra&quot;&apos;&apos;kad 3&apos;0th) will be special election numbers of six pages each;   we hope you will arrange that these shall be on sale at all the big election meetings in your area.&quot;leaflets.     We are also getting out the party Election laniTesto in leaflet form and three or&quot;&apos;four otheT&quot; le afiets explaining the various points in the Manifesto:   these are to be used for distribution.   We shall forward to you a quantity of these leaflets when they are ready.   We propose to allot them to the Districts and Locals in proportion to their orders for the Autumn camoaign leaflet, except in the case of -those locals which have communists standing as candidates, these will of course require a larger quantity,&quot;The following is a list of avowed communists who are contesting seats:   the first three are standing as communist, the remainder as Labour candidates:In addition to the above several Labour candidates have either communist sympathies or are claimed by the party as supporters:   of the Labour candidate for the Ladywood Division of Birmingham, for instance, it was stated at m aggregate meeting of the local Communist Party held at the A.E.TJ.

&quot;Dr. Dunstan is an avowed communist working inside thelabour Party.... This must not.be stated.outside these roomsand I hope you will all keep it to yourselves.&quot;Harry Pollitt, who is in charge of the communistelection campaigns in Scotland, was informed by Tom Bellon behalf of the Political Bureau on Hovember 2Zxi&amp; that:&quot;We had imder consideration the selection of a national panel of speakers and we have agreed upon the following;-T.A. Jackson Tom MannWoH. Andrews (S. Africa) Minnie Birch A. Horner T. Bell ii Mrs. CrawfurdJ.T. Murphy&quot;We have decided to send, those speakers round the constituencies in rotation or. by arrangement.   I have therefore wired Dundee to fix meeting with Jackson on Tuesday and Tom Mann to be fixed at Motherwell on Tuesday, thereafter to bring Mann to Greenock and then Glasgow and Dundee, and Jackson to Glasgow, Motherwell end Graonock, the idea being&apos; to have them do a meeting in each constituency after which they will come to Manchester and straight on to London. &apos;&quot;I will advise you the order in which I am sending the other speakers.   We shall arrange to secure continuity in visits so that you shall receive some one in the constituency every day.&apos;&quot;The expenses of this panel are met by our central Fund for Speakers, and we have a list of names that can be used by you provided the constituencies are prepared to accept financial Responsibility,   The following are the names:-Miss E. Robson, 6, Dundock St., Barrow-in-Furness. Mrs. Ac Walker, Thorburn Street, wagebill, Liverpool. W.T. Cardinal, 46, Ashted Bow, Birmingham. R. Bishop, 142, Came en Road, H.W.G. Williams, 19, Francis St., Dowlais, s, Wales..C. Boyle, c/o Lismer, 56, Rushdale Rd., Meersbrook,Sheffield,H. Sara, 15, Brlxton Grove, Crouch Hill, H. Bert Joy, 15, Gassiot Rd., Tooting, S.W.&quot;From this list you will see the names of one or two very useful workers and if you think it advisable you can gat into touch with them directly. By the way, what is the position with regard, to the local.speakers in Scotland?   Have they all been mobilised?   I have turned over to vjuelch the question of speakers&apos; notes, and am getting him to arrange from data that I have prepared that I am certain would be suitable/
suitable for propagandists.    I will issue that as often as is possible.   I have also spoken with Coates to-day about sending materials in connection with Trade withKussia, and he assures me that bundles of material will be sent to each agent and also to all our speakers on our list.-&quot;I am in communication with Philips Price and am suggesting to him that he try and make one visit at least to Motherroell..    I will advise you as soon as I hear from him.,&quot;In connection with his suggested visit to MdtherwellPrice was informed by Tom Bell that:&quot;We know the work on your shoulders at the moment, but add that we are prepared to make it as easy for you as possible.   For instance, if sou would go to Motherwell we could arrange for you to take a sleeping car, and travel over night, arid thus save time.   We are quite willing to meet all financial responsibility for that.&quot;An effort is being made to induce Indians in London, Oxford, Cambridge, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Edinburgh, Dundee, Liverpool, and Glasgow to subscribe towards the election expenses of Saklatvala, who is stated t o have given expression in the House &quot;to the true Indian and International stand-point without indulging in hackneyed, flattering praise of an unnatural and unhealthy Imperial bondage of one country over another.&quot;It is not uninteresting to note that on November 21st Saklatvala sent a oheque for  1.10.0., together with his membership card, which was presumably to be stamped, to the St. Pancras group of the Communist, Party.Speaking at a communist meeting held on Clapham,Common on November 25th, A.M. Wall, who is organisingcommunist assistance for Saklatvala said:&quot;If labour gets returned our ideals will be nearer realisation, because a capital levy in this country would wreck foreign credit and smash British capitalism.   Wall Street and every foreign exchange in Europe would boycott British currency, and the capitalist system with its paper^money-foundations would crumple up..  I advise everyone here to support the labour movement in this election.   Help Mr, Saklatvala for all you are worth.   Ii&apos; you have not already done so, go to his committee rooms and undertake any work he has to offer.   I am speaking every evening until the election is over in support of the labour candidates in Battersea, Balaam and Brixtcn.&quot;
x 8 **653The Manchester communists wished Harry Pollitt, who failed to secure nomination for Paisley, to stand as a candidate for the Hulme Division, for which he appears to have been officially adopted by the local Labour Party: communist Headquarters refused to endorse his candidature and the Manchester District Organiser thereupon reported that:&quot;The position of the Party members who have been putting in such a great amount of work in the Hulme Labour Party for the last 12 months and have succeeded in getting control of the whole movement is seriously jeopardised by this disappointment and Comrade G. Staunton of Manchester L.?0C, who has been the most energetic of the comrades and whom I have just seen, is quite crushed by the reversal cf the position for they were confident that they could have put up a splendid fight and got great prestige for the Pftvty round the candidature.   However, I suppose we shall have to put up with the inevitable.&quot;In reply, Arthur HacMacrcts, on behalf of thePolitical Bureau, stated that:&quot;In the first place, the policy we decided on after having considered the possibilities which the speedy election would place upon the Labour Party, was to use every endeavour&apos; to get party members adopted as Labour candidates.     You must remember, however, that the financial resources of tho Party for this election are extremely- limited indeed and therefore we had to reserve the right to examine all constituencies who were prepared to adopt our people and only to decide upon spending money where we wero sure of at least a sporting chance of winning.&quot;How with regard to Hulme, while everyone is agreed that a more or less good fight could be put up, yet no one has so far ventured any possibility of winning the seat.   Even you yourself, while referring to the district, simply state that 1 the local members were confident that they could put up a splendid fight and get prestige for the Party round the qandidature&apos;.   This^a &quot;exactly Wh opinion of those who have given consideration to the matter which while we are only too anxious to do anything which is likely to add to the prestige of the Party, yet we could not agree to spend three or four hundred pounds purely to achieve this.   We are now practically at the end of our financial tether and had simply money left for one more constituency and our choice lay between spending it in Hulme or holding it ovor against the possibility of a lagt minute opportunity for contesting a probable winning seat.&quot;In the Liverpool area communists are working for thereturn of j. Hayes.M. Philips Price/
M. Philips Price and other communist candidates have hean instructed tc send 50 oopies of their eleotion addresses to Headquarters for&apos;filing and &quot;for the irurpose of forwarding copies to Moscow.&quot;The seoretary of the Coventry branch of the Coumunistpurty has requested the District Organiser to informHarry Pollitt that:&quot;Comrade Purcell is going strong and we have all ready reduced Manville&apos;3 weight by about 10 ftone, by the time we have done with him he will be a grease spot but hess got quite a lot of flesh on him Btill,&quot;J.T. Murphy has asked the editor of the &quot;InternationalPress Correspondence&quot;:&quot;To get a message from the (1) Metal Workers (;2) Miners   (3) Railwayman of the Ruhr and Silesia to tho same workers of MOvherwell - which is the Ruhr area of Scotland - urging them to support Nawbold at the polls..&quot;Ha will have a stiff fight this time and everyounce of assistance as per above will be gladly welcomed.&quot;Especially try to get a message from the SteelWorkers of Rheinhauser - the gang who owns these works also owns the Lanarkshire Steel Cou, atCraigneuk in the Motherwell constituency-. Act quickly - Polling day December 6th.&quot;Aitken Ferguson, the Scottish organiser of theCommunist Party, who has been nominated as officiallabour candidate at Ealvingrove has sent the followinginteresting account of the preliminaries to his adoptionto communist headquarters:&quot;It was simply to get the Trade Union Delegates up against that jap. Party Ruling &quot;re communists that I went forward.. 0 We 11 I nearly dropped dead when I learned on returning from Edinburgh that my nomination was th roughs&quot;You see the candidates were Bailie Junes Walker (iron end Steel Trades contested Rotherham last time), Leigh man, an I.Lfp0 Lawyer, and myself.&quot;The looal Lab. Party met in consult at ion with . the Trades Council. E.C&apos;.      A sympathiser was in the chair.&quot;After a Big Discussion the vote was taken. Walker (Nominee of City Branch I.L-P. - ask McManus about it) received 17 votes, I received 15 votesand /
and Loiahman&apos; 4 votes.&quot;Leishman dropped out and then Wallter and I were voted on.     It was a tie.   17 votes each and the Chairmen gave his casting vote for me.&quot;Thenof course he&apos;s a communist, etc.   But this was clubbed so that I have to go before Trades Council for endorsement on Wednesday nighto   There is going to be. a big fight and if wo can got the Glasgow Trades Council to scrap that ruling of labour party E.Co then its the Biggest Victory we have yet gained *   The Glasgow Trades Council is easily the most important in the country and we:vo got to win. p;ow what do you say.   I think that we can win the seat. There is- a very a erase industrial population in it. Practically all Anderson where labour poll in Municipal Elections a sis thousand vote,   sandy ford where Como Duffy, a communist, polled 2,000 votes and parts of Cvarnewtono&quot;I think and am very confidant that with a good slashing campaign we could win the seat.....&quot;If Vm adopted 1*11 set everybody on tho job of raising finance but you had better get that deposit mone&apos;y up because the time is too short to raise anything.&quot;The story of Ferguson&apos;s successful nomination is continued in a letter written by HaoMsnus on November 22ndin which ho says:&quot;In the West of Scotland in the last two days Aitken Ferguson, our Scotch Organiser was nominated for a seat in Eelvingrove and when it came before the labour Party, low and behold, after a strong fight, Ferguson actually secured the Official Labour Party adoption against one of the strongest Labour and I.L.P. men in Glasgow, Bailey James Walker.    It is such an opportunity as this that we are finally holding ourselves in reserve for and again     while we regret that the comrades in Huime will have to be disappointed this time, yot, all things considered I think they will agree -that in such a critical two weeks for the Party as the last tvio weeks have been, we have done smasingly well in getting nine good candidates well placed in gpod constituencies.&quot;In the sane&apos;connection MacManus wrote to Ferguson:&quot;The whole situation has been very interesting and knowing, not only the districts, but your two opponents as I do, I think you pulled off a very good stroke of business indeed.    It will be extremely interesting to study the attitude how of Maxton arid the other official Labour candidates in the event of your going forward.&apos;   Do not forget to invite Maxton and these. fellows to support you In your campaign and if necessary you can remind Maxton that one of the first things I did last election in arriving in Glasgow was to tour his constituency and support him.&quot;Although/
Although Gallaoher himself does not appear oversanguine of suooess at Dundee his supporters seem to havefew misgivings and the secretary of tho local groupreported to headquarters on November 22nd that:&quot;Com.

Cllmie, is &quot;prepared to allow members of the party on his platform.&quot;P. Haye, the national secretary of the NationalUnemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement, has stated that:&quot;It has been decided after a fairly lengthy discussion by the sub-Committee at last Saturday&apos;s meeting that it would be inadvisable to publish a questionnaire for the coming General Election.&quot;The main reason for this was that there are possibilities in some circumstances of some of the Labour candidates refusing to agree with some of the questions that would be laid  own.   In the event of this happening, tho local Unemployed Committee would have no other alternative, but to offer their opposition.     We therefore think that at this juncture it would not be good policy, but rather to concentrate upon getting them In or rather getting the Labour Party into power if at all possible. Our tasks, if and&quot; after this has been done, will be quite clear.&quot;As a reBult of enquiries into the movements of theleaders of the organised unemployed in Tottenham last week,it/
- IS -it was asoertained that they and many of their supporters ware engaged in oanvaBSing the electorate on behalf of the Labour candidate.It is reported on the authority of a single informant that &quot;there is likely to be trouble&quot; at non-Labour meetings in some London areas notably Stratford, West Ham, Bow and Bromley, where the Communist Party is strong:   it is proposed to use &quot;stink bombs&quot;.The. British Bureau of the Led International ofLabour Unions has instructed its supporters to giveprominence to the following points during the election:&quot;1.     The need for the unification of all Labour forces., to secure the return of a Labour majority.2.     The need for a progressive Industrial policy to secure a drastic reduction of working hours, and an increase in the standard of living.3*    Pull maintenance for all unemployed workers.40    Pull official recognition of the Prussian workers Government.5*     The present German situation, and its relation to the British working-class movement.&quot; .The Young Communist League has Issued a manifesto &quot;to all voteless young workers&quot; which is, in effect, a repetition of the Party manifesto quoted in this report: the League pledges itself to &quot;assist to the utmost extent of its power the communist and labour candidates&quot;.Tho Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation has issued a leaflet addressed to working-class electors headed&quot;The Vote is Useless^   Boycott the Ballot BoxS&quot; in thecourse of which it is stated that:&quot;The ballot-box merely gives you the opportunity to express an opinion.   It gives you no power whatever. It guarantees no desire of yours being carried into effect.     As workers you have and can have no direct control over parliament.   Therefore you should boycott the ballot-box, since the opinion&apos; you are called upon
n r nGa8%   13   mto express is thet, by returning a person to sit in Westminster you can somehow solve the social problem.&quot;Parliament cannot solve unemployment.   It cannot abolish pauperism.   To abolish poverty it must abolish itself.   For parliament is only the talking section of the State Machine:   ana the   State is paid for out of surplus value.   It is maintained out of the wealth stolen from the worker on the field of production^ stolen from him in the workshop, stolen from him when he receives his pay envelope. Whether controlled outwardly by Tory, Liberal, or Labour Party, the State exists merely to perpetuate policeman!sm and slavery, to keep the workers in submission, and the condition of the people problem unsolved,&quot;OTJKR COMMUNIST ACTIVITIESThe Political 3ureau of the Communist Party hascircularised all District Part;;) committees, unattachedlocals, nucleus loaders and communists in the amalgamated engineering Union on the subject of nominations for theExecutive of the Amalgamated Engineering Union:     theaddressees are asked to work for the nomination ofJ.D.

Young has received the following interesting letter dated Moscow, November 17th from Sigi Bamatter, who formerlyvisited this country on behalf of the Young CommunistInternational to re-organise the Young Communist Leagues&quot;Received your letter from Birmingham, also p.c. from Barrow (some time ago) and letter from H.(j. after convention.     This last letter pleased me very much.   I should have written to you before but am so busy.   Well, you will hear officially from us and get all the neoessary information.     The progress made with the neuclei is grand.   Hope things will continue like that.   Watch our circular re connections between neuolei in G.B. and other countries (Russia, Germany, eto.) this is very important.   You oould try to give us some addresses from the mining districts in S.W. so that we can make connections between the mining districts of Germany (Ruhr) and Russia (Donetz, Ural, Siberia) also try to make connections between neuclei in naval ports and shipbuilding contres. Barrow (Viokers7 for instance could be connected with the factory in  ronstadt.   You remember that meeting in the marine engine works of Martinows, would^t it be a fine idea to connect them with the young workers of Vickors?    Write me about it, these &apos;little* things are very important.   We get in closer touoh with each other and the neuolei got work and suggest ions for work. Do what you can in this respect.   The mid land s (text lie) could make connections with Moscow and Petrograd, Sheffield and Birminghtan with Tula (rifle manufacture, cutler;;, eto.) the Shilbuilders (Tyne, Glasgow, eto.) with the German comrades (Stettin, Hamburg, Altona, eto.) such connection diould be made with all countries. Most important of course is connection witl^TJermany and Russia.    well,-watch for our material.   We intend publish speoial pamphlet for liebkneoht day.   See our letter.     We also intend to publish temporarily&apos;Internatioual/

The following resolution was passed:&quot;This great gathering of employed and worklese citizens declares that unemployment is a recurring feature of the existing economic system common to , every country irrespective of whether it is protection or Erse Trades   It denounces as wholly inadequate and belated this programme of winter work produced by the Government which offers the prospect of employment for only a fraction of the unemployed in a few industries, and in particular gives no hope whatever for employment for women and young persons;   further, declares that whatever party is returned to power as a result of the General Election it shall take the necessary steps to provide useful employment at Trade Union rates and conditions pending which full maintenance shall be conceded^3As the contingents were leaving the Square a man named Ronald Leggett, a member of Ho. 2 Company of the British Fascist! and an ex-naval lieutenant, attempted to seize a red flag carried by a .marshal1 of tha Bethnal Green contingent named lachinski:     leggett was charged at Bow Street the following day with assaulting words and behaviour and with assaulting Lachinski:   he was remanded until December 3rd, bail of  5 in his own recognisances being allowed in order that Lachinski might be able to obtain witnesses.The organised unemployed continue to hold meetings and to send deputations to Boards of Guardians and many of them are doing work, such as canvassing in connection with the Election.It/

- so -and none of the leaders are prepared to issue instructions as to tho Irish vote:   the probabilities are that the main Irish vote will be split between Liberal and Labour: the extremists have no voice at all in the matter.In Scotland a circular has been sent out to the Republican Clubs inviting them to revert to the eld&apos;Sinn Fein organisation:   an Ard Fheis, to decide the question, is to be summoned in January or February.The Communist Party of Ireland has again been re-orgsnised, owing to the chaos and confusion reigning in its ranks, and the following officials have been appointed:Roderick J. Connolly appears to have regained control and has a very ambitious policy:   he hopes to build up a genuine left wing of the Irish Labour &quot;Movement but is almost certain to fail:   he has a certain amount of ability t,nd the help of his father&apos;s name, but no real capacity as a leader.Joe Robinson, former o/c, Irish Republican Army, Scotland, has now gone over to the political side of themovement, and is in great demand as a speaker.Generally speaking things are in a b^d way with the Irish Republican Army in Scotland:   everyone is under suspioion and accusations are general.     Slane, the o/C, has given orders that as few parades as possible are to be held;   be is, he s$ys, expecting a raid and round up before the How Year:     the C.I.L. he says, know whom to put their hands upon with regard to the peterhead affair.
