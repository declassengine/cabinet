S 1 C R g T Copy No.C A B I IT ITCP. 434 (S3).HOME affairs COMMITTEES fTRADE FACILITIES BILL(Memorandum by the financial Secretary to the Treasury),I eiroulate herewith a draft of a Trade FacilitiesBill.Clause X ^, Extension of.Trade FaoilitleB Acts,.It will ba reoalled that the Cabinet, on 27th June, 1923, decided (Conclusion 6) that power should be taken in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill 1923 to extend the powers of the Treasury (which will expire on the 9th November next) to guarantee loans under the Trade Facilities Acts 1921 and 1922.        It was subsequently rulsd by th$ Authorities of the House Of Commons that aujli an extension would not be.proper to an Expiring&apos;Laws Continuance Bill and the Acts were struck out from the Schedule te the Bill. It is, therefore, necessary to introduce a special Bill during this session to give effeot to the Cabinet decision.Clause II -   Guarantees under Overseas Trade AotsvUnder the Overseas Trade Acts 1920-1922 as extended by the Expiring laws (Continuance) Act, 1923, the Board of Trade were authorised by Parliament to make arrangements in connection with export trade for granting credits and giving guarantees to an, amount nob exceeding 25,000,000
dad 26,000,000 suoh credits and guarantees to be granted before the8th day of September, 1924, and to be liquidated not later than the 8th day of September 1927.The granting of credits, i.e, advances of cash to exporters^ has now been discontinued, but as regards the guarantees, after reference to The Cabinet it was decided that power should be taken authorising the Board to give guarantees to be liquidated before the 8th September, 1930. The maximum liability of  26^000,000 is not increased,&apos;Clause III&apos; -i Soudan guaranteed Loan.,By the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922, the Treasury were authorised to guarantee the principal of and interest on any loan raised by the Government of the Soudan for irrigating the Gezireh Plain not exceeding an amount sufficient to raise  3,5Q0p00. The position then (December 1922) wa3 that the Soudan Government had spent over  5,000,000 raised under British guarantee under the Act of 1919 on the building of the Dam which is now being completed and that it would cost another  7,000,000 at least to build it.      It was impossible while the relations of Egypt and the Soudan remained undetermined for the Soudan to hope to raise the money on their own credit.    It was decided to guarantee  3  millions of the  7,000,000 required, the idea being that by the . time the balance was required the Soudan Government might be able to raise it by realisation of assets or that by -that time the relations between JUgypt and the Soudan would have been settled and the Soudan Government would have been able to raise a loan on its own credit.     It iB now clear that neither alternative is possible and it is necessary therefore to guarantee a loan for the balancerequired
required.     It is proposed that the guarantee shall he for an amount sufficient to raise a further  3,500,000, making  7,000,000 in all under the Act of 1922, subject to the limits and conditions laid down in the 1922 Act.TR1ASTJRY,, . S,1?-30th Cc yocer.  1923 &apos;i
