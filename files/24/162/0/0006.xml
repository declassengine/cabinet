Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government) Secret.MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST C01.IMI SHI ONER OF VfORKS.With reference to the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum, CP. 394 (23) reoomraending the ratification of the Geneva Convention concerning the use of white lead in painting, the only comment which I think I need make is on the question whether such public buildings as county courts, post-offices, and labour exchanges, should not come under the exception allowed to &quot;industrial establishments&quot; in the Geneva Convention.    I wish to make it clear that, in the opinion of my Department; the exception should, be allowed for such buildings, which are subjected to so much .uaage that the internal paintwork has to be washed at frequent intervals.    The leadless paints at present available will not stand so much washing as lead paints; and consequently, if the former have to be used, more frequent painting will be needed, which will, of course, add considerably to the expense of maintenance.   My Department, however, takes up the attitude that it is willing not to press this point, if it be the only obstacle in the way c^F ratification of the Convention.CP. 406  (23)HOME AFFAIRS; COkLITTEEWHITE LEAD(Intld. ) J.B.25.9.23.
