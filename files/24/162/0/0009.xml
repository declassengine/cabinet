(This document la the property of His Britannio Majeaty&apos;s Government).Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1, The point for decision&quot; is briefly whether the use of paint containing white lead should be prohibited for internal work.   There is no dispute that the use of such paint should be strictly regulated, and that, subject to this, its use for external work should continue to be allowed.   In this respeot the position has completely changed during the last 10 or 12 years.   As a result of Committees which reported before the war it was then proposed to prohibit entirely (with some very minor exceptions) the use of white lead paint, whether for internal or for external work but the report of Sir Henry Norman&apos;s committee issued in February last oonfirms the deoision of the International Labour Conference at Geneva in 1921 that white lead paint need not be prohibited for external use, and the question is whether, now that external prohibition has been abandoned, prohibition for internal use oan still be maintained,2, On merits the only justification for Such prohibition -is that based on medical considerations and suoh considerations are mentioned first by the Home Secretary in his list of arguments in favour of prohibition.   This point seems, however, to need further examination.   It is true that the Norman Committee support the International Labour Conference in recommending prohibition, but this part of the committee&apos;sSECRETCP.409 (23)cabinet home Affairs Committee.WHITE LEAD.-1-
,   i 75report does not seem so clear and convincing as the remainder. The Committee state explicitly (page 24) that almost the whole clanger arises from duet, and they also mention (page 26) the minor danger from splashes of paint.   Both these dangers exist, however, in connection with external painting and In that case it is proposed to cope with them by regulations prohibiting dry rubbing-down (the main source of dust) and enforoing other precautions.   It may be argued that these regulations will be ineffective either through laok of inspection or owing to hostility on the part of the workers.   The litter contingency seems Improbable but in any oase it would presumably not have been decided to allow white lead paint in external work unless there had been reason to think that the regulations would be effective in obviating the admitted dangers.   Since the Conference met, evidence which is virtually oonolusive has been aooumulated as to the practicability of uaing waterproof sand paper and so completely obviating dry rubbing down, which is ad-mitted to be the chief source of danger in connection with the use of white lead paint.   As damp rubbing down with waterproof sand paper Is stated to be easier and better than dry rubbing down, there is every reason to think that the new process will be readily adopted.   In these clrcunstanoes the case on merits for Internal prohibition seems to lose most of its strength,3. Some of the other arguments mentioned in the Home Offioe memorandum in favour of prohibition undoubtedly have seme weight and the strongest of these is the argument that the Convention was adopted on a suggestion of one of the British Government delegates and was supported by the whole of the British delegates.   This is true, but the chief British delegate in giving his vote for the Convention accompanied it with a reservation as desoribed in the Home Offioe memorandum,and the case contemplated by the reservation
mMmmm1aeems now to have arisen.   It way no doubt be-&apos;argued with soihe force that the system of periodical- International Conferences for arriving at agreeiaen-te on labour matters will receive a serious set-back if thoeo agreements are not honoured by   i. the Governments whose representatives vote for them.   It must be remembered, however, that the special Expert Committee at Geneva which first considered the question deoided by a majority against prohibition, and though the full Conference reversed this decision, the parties for and against prohibition were equally balanced, apart from the vote of the British delegates, and the original Intention of the latter was to adopt a neutral attitude.   It should also bo remembered that ciroumstanoes have changed since tho Convention as a result of (a) the above mentioned evidence as to the practicability of damp rubbing down and (b) the realisation that a much greater proportion of paint work is of an internal oharaoter than had been previously estimated.4, The other arguments in the Home Office Memorandum as to the Convention representing a compromise between contending views in a long standing controversy and as to the certainty of tho controversy being revived if the compromise is repudiated may be countered by the certainty that controversy will equally arise if a proposal for ratifying the Convention is brought forward.5, The Home Office memorandum admits the existence of arguments against ratifying the Convention, such as the inquiry to the white lead and paint manufacturers if prohibition is enaotedw, and tho prejudioe to the Australian lead industry. Some information amplifying these points is given in the appendix to this note, and the Board of Trade think it will be agreed that they oonstitute important factors in the case. They are not, however, the only objections., jit is not known on what basic the Home Office estimate this Iocs \W5f,.   The estimate is considerably less than la indicated by tho -nfprmation furnished to the Board of Trade.
6. The report states specifioally that the prohibition of white lead paint is likely to involve an increase of cost having regard to the total outlay required to maintain respectively lead and existing leadleso paints in comparable oondition over a reasonable period of yoars.   This extra expense will) of course, be increased if, as seems likoly, the prohibition of white lead paint were followed by an increase in the price of zino (see appendix).     In any caBe, when the number of buildings involved is considered, it will be clear that the cost of sub-situting zinc for lead paint will be very considerable and it will fall on owners and tonanto of property all over the oountry. It is true that the report contemplates oertaln important exemptions from the prohibition and the question of extending these exemptions has beon raised by the Norman Committee; Without discussing that question tho Board of Trade would point out that while any exemptions1 allowed will diminish the aggregate extra cost of painting, it is very diffioult if not impossible, to find a logioal basis for defining the exemptions. The buildings proposed to be exempted are of a public or industrial oharacter and their exemption would not relieve th^ owners or tenants of private property.   In faot such owners or tenants would almost oertainly make a grievanoe of having fco. UBe a more expensive and less effective process than that used by the Government and public author!tios.   The Home Offioe memorandum states that it is probable that by 1927 leadlees paints will have improved and if this is correct it would havo a considerable bearing on the particular point now under discussion.   The Board of Trade are, however, not aware of any evidence to justify such an expectation,   Leadless paints have been made on a very large soale for many years, their technology has been in the hands of able men, and their advantages and limitations are now well known.
7. A further objection to prohibition which is particularly important at the present time is the question of its effect on. -employment.   The suggested prohibition would clearly have a serious effect on -employment in the white lead industry.8. An argument of another character is the question whether if the Convention were ratified it would be enforced in other countries as effectively as it would no doubt be enforced here.   This is not an argument which can be publicly used and it is perhaps not of. prime importance in the present case but it is certainly not negligible.9. The Board of Trade wish to make it clear that they have no desire to exalt commercial considerations over considerations affecting the safety and health of workers.   If they were convinced that the proposed prohibition of white lead for internal painting would materially assist in preventing the admittedly serious industrial diseases associated with the use of white lead they would warmly support the proposal.   So far as they can judge, however, the available evidence tends to show that the enforcement of regulations prohibiting dry rubbing down and requiring other precautions to be taken will seoure the desired results;   and it is far from clear that the prohibition of riaite lead for internal work would result in substantial additional advantages from the health point of view.   In these circumstances they think they are justified in pressing the commercial considerations beaming on the problem and in suggesting that in all the circumstances the proposal for prohibition should not be accepted.(Intld.) P.LI.-G. 6.10.23.
APPENDIX.White lead as it appears in commerce is an opaque white solid, containing slightly over 80$ of metallic lead.   The lead used must be particularly pure ot &quot;soft&quot;, free from silver and from copper or iron.   Por this reason the chief white lead makers are themselves silver refiners.   Refining cannot be usefully carried on in a small way and lead refining in this country has hitherto been an important industry both from the purely commercial standpoint and still more so from certain national safety aspects in that we had refining capacity for treating about 150,000 tons of lead annually, d;A,d in faot refine some 100,000 tone a year, and thus through this refining industry, maintained very substantial lead stocks in the country.The production of white lead in this country In 1907 was, according to the Census of. Production, about 50,000 tons valued then at about  1,000,000.   In 1922 production amounted to about 45,000 tons, and the number of persons employed was probably about 2,000.We imported annually for the five years to 1914 about 16,000 tons and exported about 20,000 tons.  this, taking production at 50,000 tons, gives an annual domestic consumption of 45,000 tons.   Corresponding figures for 1922 indicate a consumption of over 41,000 tons and this -bearing in mind the trade depression - indicates no general tendency to replace white lead.The manufacture of white lead for domestic consumption (45,000 tons a year), involves the use of 36,000 tons of soft piglead.   This 1b about 18hfo of our total pre-war lead consumption (196,000 tons annually).   Practioally all white lead is used for paint-making, and the most recent
information tends to show that botweon 30^ and 40$ of the total is used for making-indoor paints*.   The result of prohibiting the use of white lead for indoor painting would thus be serious.The Australian production of lead amounts to about 200,000 tons of lead in ore per annum, equivalent to about one-sixth of the total World&apos;s production.   The direct effect of the proposed prohibition on the Australian producers is obvious.   There would also be indirect effeota, due to the fact that tho Australian production is from lead-zinc ores, and the two metals (lead and   zinc) cannot be mined and treated independently.   It follows that any decrease, whatever its cause, in the amount of lead consumed is bound to react on zinc, either by actually reducing the output (because unless lead be sold zinc ore cannot be produced at an eoonomic price) or by increasing the price which must be obtained for zinc ore,   In the first case, the increased demand for zinc arising from the prohibition of white lead would tend to be met from non-British sources where zinc is obtained without association with substantial amounts of lead, and the Australian zinc mines would suffer. In the second alternative if the price of zinc ore were increased to such an extent as to make it possible for the Australian mines to compete, it must be remembered that such increase would Inevitably be refleoted in tho increSsed cost of zinc for other industrial purposes (a matter of importance to a number of industries in the United Kingdom whose employment of labour is considerable) and of zino paints themselves.Some time ago it was believed that the proportion of white lead used internally was much less, but certain recent work has changed this view.
