the broadcasting committee.REPORT.The Right Hon. Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Bart., G.B.E., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Postmaster General.Terms of Reference.1. The Committee was appointed on the 24th April, 1923, by Sir William Joynson-Hicks, then Postmaster General, to consider (a) Broadcasting in all its aspects. (6) The contracts and licences which have been or may be granted.(c) The action which should be taken upon the determi-nation of the existing licence Of the Broadcasting Company.(d) Uses to which broadcasting rriay be put.(e) The restrictions which may heed to be placed upon its user or development.2. We have held 34 meetings and have examined 32 witnesses representing the interests concerned (see Appendix A). In addition we have been favoured with memoranda by various persons and organisations who have not given oral evidence, and we have received many papers from outside sources containing much valuable information.Future of Broadcasting as a Public Utility.3. We would remark at the outset that our task is one of peculiar difficulty, owing to the fact that we are requested to present proposals for the future development of radiotelephonic broadcasting while there exists a licence from the Post Office to the British Broadcasting Company for the operation of a scheme which, while still having 18 months to run, has in certain respects, broken down in practice. We are of opinion that the Company as an operating organisation have to a large extent satisfied public requirements; but if we were to regard the existing arrangement as unalterable we should not have the necessary freedom to envisage the future. We propose in the first instance to disregard this complication and to consider the matter as though the Government had a free hand.4. The outstanding feature of radiotelephony is that it enables a single voice to reach innumerable ears.   It can carry
speech and melody into every home. It can bring isolated towns and villages into close touch with the great centres of population, and thereby alleviate one of the severest drawbacks to rural&apos; life.&quot; Already many thousands of people in all parts of the country are enjoying&apos; these facilities and responding in greater or less degree to these influences. It may be that broadcasting holds social and political possibilities as great as any technical attainment of our generation.5. Broadcasting is a mode of distribution . of music and information which at present excels in cheapness anything hitherto conceived. The total expenditure of an operating concern broadcasting a daily programme from the London station is at the rate of less than a penny per head per annum of the total population within range, and only a few pence per head in the case of Glasgow. It would seem probable that all large communities may eventually demand this inexpensive service. Further, it is possible that imperial and international broad-casting services may eventually be established.6. For these reasons we consider, that the control of such a potential power over public opinion and the life of the nation ought to remain with the State, arid that the operation of so important a national service ought not to be allowed to become an unrestricted commercial monopoly.7. All wireless telegraphy and telephony has to be conducted within a limited group of &quot; wave-lengths,&quot; which is already largely occupied with the- communications of the fighting services, the marine work-of ship and shore stations, and&apos;the commercial work-of fixed stations.&apos; Every new wireless station takes up a certain amount of elbow room, technically called its &quot; waveband,&quot; which no other sending station within a certain radius should be permitted to use. The wavebands available in any country must therefore be regarded as a valuable form of public property; and the right to use them for any purpose should only be given after full and careful consideration. Those which are assigned to any particular interest should be subject to the safeguards necessary to protect the public interest in the future. Should readjustments become necessary after definite allocations of this national property, they may be found both difficult and costly. These considerations as applied to broad-casting call attention from another angle to the need for national control. M8. New applications of broadcasting will arise from time to time in many directions. Already, in addition to entertainment programmes, matter such as the following is broadcast, and the public is likely to demand further matter of this sort in the future :; (a) Announcements of events of universal public interest.(b) Important statements by the Government.(c) Debates in Parliament-and other public bodies.
.&apos;   ;.     ^-Speeches, lectures; and sermons.i. v.;- (e) Information of value to the commercial public.::U &apos;(/) Weather forecasts. ;&apos; .&quot;.*&apos;&apos;..&apos; (g) Sporting intelligence.       &apos; .........,, ..... . (h) Police warnings. ... &apos;&quot;. &apos;j -Other uses will appear as time goes on. ;; 9.. Much of the broadcast matter-e.g., lectures, speeches and good music is of considerable educative, value, and may awaken new interests among &quot; listeners &quot;. of all classes. &apos; A, great deal will depend on the character of the programmes.; and^ it ,is obviously of importance that a high standard should be. maintained. Subject to this condition, we are satisfied that, broadcasting will be of great educative value, both directly and^ indirectly. In this connection we have been much impressed&apos; with the widespread enthusiasm which broadcasting&quot; has aroused. Large numbers of persons who have never before taken any interest in such matters are now acquiring knowledge of. the: principles of wireless telegraphy and telephony, and of the con-; stfuction and working &quot;of wireless receiving sets. A new class; of literature on the subject has sprung up and is widely,read, This new interest and study will&apos;, we are convinced, have- good effects from the educational point-&apos; of&apos; view, and will stimulate experiment and research. The listener may perhaps become an experimenter;: the experimenter .. may.... possibly. become : an inventor. &apos; .: -    ,      ..,  &quot;  Events LeadIng to Appointment of Committee..10. It will-be convenient to give a brief account, of the negotiation - of the existing broadcasting scheme, its principal features, and the difficulties in carrying it out, which culminated in a deadlock and inthe -appointment of this Committee.11. Negotiation of existing Scheme. On the 4th May, 1922, Mr. Kellaway (then Postmaster General) announced in the House of Commons that he had decided to allow the establish-ment of a limited number of broadcasting stations, and was calling a conference of the firms who had applied for licences to establish such stations. This conference was held on the 18th May, 1922, and was attended by representatives of 24 firms engaged in the manufacture of wireless apparatus.. A committee of manufacturers was subsequently appointed by these and all other firms who were known to be interested, and negotiations were entered into with them by the Post Office. As a result, on the 18th July, 1922, Mr. Kellaway stated in the House of Commons the main features of a proposed scheme for which he had obtained Cabinet approval. Further negotiations ensued, and the scheme was agreed upon between the Postmaster General and the committee before Mr. Kellaway left the Post Office and
was succeeded by Mr. Neville Chamberlain on the 2nd November, 1922. In the meantime (according to evidence submitted by the British Broadcasting Company) the scheme had been explained and approved at a general meeting on the 18th October to which 400 manufacturers were invited and which.300 attended. Certain details were not finally settled until January, 1923, and it was not until the 18th of that month that a licence was issued to the British Broadcasting Company (which had been formally incorporated on the 15th December, 1922, and had, with the Postmaster GeneraFs approval, commenced operations on an earlier date) to establish and work a system of broadcasting during a period of 26 months from the 1st November, 1922, to the 1st January, 1925. The final agreements between the Company and its constituent members the form of which was set out in a schedule to the licence were not ready for signature until the end of March, 1923.12. The issue of broadcast receiving licences at Post Offices began on the 1st November, 1922, and a daily broadcasting service was started at the London station on the 15th November. Stations were opened at later dates at Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle-on-Tyne. Stations at Aberdeen and Bournemouth are being erected now, and two relay stations have been sanctioned experimentally to serve other populous areas.13. Outline of existing Scheme. The principal features of the scheme which was recognised as being necessarily of a provisional nature were as follows : -(a) A Company (called the British Broadcasting Com-pany) to be formed among British manufacturers of wireless apparatus. Any such manufacturer to be entitled to join the Company on subscribing for one or more  1. shares, and on paying a deposit of  50 and entering into an agreement in the form approved by the Postmaster General.(b) The Company to establish eight broadcasting stations and to provide a regular service to the reasonable satisfaction of the Postmaster General. The Company to pay a royalty of  50 per annum in respect of each station.(c) The Post Office to issue broadcast receiving licences at a fee of 105. a year containing a condition that the sets used, and certain parts (viz,, valves, valve amplifiers, head telephones, and loud speakers) must bear a standard mark &quot; B.B.C. Type approved by Postmaster General.&quot;(d) The Post Office to pay the Company a sum equal to one-half of the licence fees received in respect of broad-cast and experimental receiving licences.(e) The sets sold by members of the Company, as a condition of bearing the &quot; B.B.C.&quot; mark, to be British made, to carry a payment to the Company in accordance
with a tariff approved by the Postmaster General, ;and to require&apos;&apos;the Postmaster GeneraFs approval of;the type of. set, such approval being confined to securing that the; apparatus would not be likely to cause, radiation from . the receiving aerial. The tariff payments on apparatus,d which were required by the Postmaster General, could in. certain circumstances be reduced by.him after consultation . with the Company.(/) No advertising or paid matter to be broadcast,--and only such news as is obtained from news agencies: approved by the Postmaster General. - -(g) The Company not to pay dividends at a higher rate than 71 per cent, per annum.(A); An undertaking to be given that the requisite capital, would be subscribed, that the service would be continued.; throughout the period of the licence, and that any deficit-would be met.   Six firms undertook these responsibilities-; and were given the right each to nominate a director, two-1 additional directors being nominated by the remaining firms who might take up shares, and-an independent, chairman being appointed by the six firms. These conditions were embodied in the licence issued to the-Company on the 18th January, 1923.*14. Difficulties leading to Deadlock-In reply to a question in the House of Commons on the 27th July, 1922, Mr.. Kellaway stated that &quot; provision will be made under which amateurs who-construct their own receiving sets.....will be allowed to-use them,&quot; the view then taken by the Post Office being that if an applicant were sufficiently skilled to make his own apparatus-he would have sufficient knowledge to make: proper use of an. experimental licence, which is free of the restriction inserted in. the broadcasting licence as to the type of apparatus to be used. On the strength, however, of Mr. Kellaway&apos;s statement, firms . began to place on the market ready-made parts,- both of British. and foreign manufacture, which could easily be built up by the purchaser into a receiving set. Home-assembled apparatus of this sort paid little or no contribution to the British Broadcasting Company, and for this and other reasons was very much cheaper to buy than B.B.C. apparatus, while purchasers claimed that their sets were home-made, and that they were entitled to experi-mental licences in accordance with Mr. Kellaway&apos;s promise. It will be apparent, however, that there is a distinction between the man who, before the inauguration of the broadcasting service, was sufficiently interested in wireless to build a set and experiment with it, and the person who, subsequent to the establishment of the service, assembled or built a set only to listen to the programmes.. * Command Paper No. 1822 of 1923
15. The question of experimental licences was discussed in September, 1922, by the Post Office and the committee of manu-facturers mentioned above, and it was agreed that in considering applications for such licences the term &quot; experimenter&quot; should be interpreted ^liberally for the time being; but the question soon arose whether the liberality afforded was not too great. The sale of parts began to undermine the sale of complete sets; and, in response to representations by the British Broadcasting Company that experimental licences were being issued to many more persons than were genuine experimenters, the Post Office agreed in January, 1923, to issue experimental licences only to persons with- unquestionable qualifications, the applications from other-persons being held over for further consideration.-16. The British Broadcasting Company claim that while they were adhering rigorously to the Agreement no steps were taken by the Post Office to carry out its duties with respect to the evasion of licences and terms of licences. On the other hand it is represented by the Post Office that it had become practically impossible for the Department to enforce its existing Tegulations and to take action against the large number of persons who were using home-made sets without a licence. Por however willing such a person might be to take out a licence, the Post -Office had no licence to give him, seeing that he was not fulfilling the conditions of a broadcast receiving licence and was not -entitled to an experimental licence. The Postmaster General -stated in the House of Commons that no proceedings would be&quot; taken hi such cases until a further announcement had been made on &apos; the subject. Suggestions were then made from various sources that a new type of &quot; constructor^ &quot; licence should be issued to meet these cases; but although the British Broadcasting Company agreed in principle to the issue of such a licence, not-withstanding the fact that they need not have done so under the terms of their licence, it proved impossible for the Post Office and the Company to come to an agreement as to the conditions on which such licences should be issued. A situation intolerable alike to the Post Office and the Company having thus arisen, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, then Postmaster General, referred the question  together with the general question of the future of broadcasting &apos; to this Committee.-- -      Merits and Defects oe Existing Scheme. 17. Aims of Scheme. The objects of the Post Office were (a) To secure the early establishment of an efficient and attractive broadcasting service without cost to the taxpayer and without the establishment of any manufac-turing monopoly.(6) To ensure that during the first two years,--i.e., until-------the 1st January, 1925 those-British manufacturers whose -enterprise inaugurated the service and the price of whose
sets was increased by the contribution to the cost of broad-casting should be protected (as explained by Mr..Kellaway in the House of Commons on the 18th July, 1922) from the &quot; ; competition of foreign manufacturers who made no - such contribution.: ; The first of these aims met with a considerable measure&apos;of success; but the machinery designed to give effect to the second proved to be in certain respects unworkable.18. Efficiency of Service. It should be stated at once that evidence placed before this Committee demonstrates that the British Broadcasting Company have shown enterprise and ability of a high order in carrying out their undertaking and have done much valuable pioneer work in face of many difficulties. They have shown a readiness to accept suggestions and advice in regard to their programmes, which have won and merited widespread approval.19. Objections to iSc7iewie.-Apart from the practical difficulties&apos;, referred to above, certain manufacturers and dealers have raised objection to the scheme on the following grounds : (as) That it is wrong in principle to attempt to control, the manufacture and importation of wireless apparatus-which is a function of the House, of Commons-by means of . licences issued by the Postmaster General. .- (6) That it is improper that firms should in effect have to --      , join the British Broadcasting Company as a condition of the , .;;   right.to manufacture and sell receiving apparatus for use -i   &apos; in this country under a broadcast receiving licence.(c) That the Company is practically controlled by a few large firms, who, it is suggested, are placed in ,a position&apos; of advantage over smaller trade rivals.(d) That certain conditions of the agreement, which members of the British Broadcasting Company have to sign are of an oppressive character or give the Company powers which might be used harshly.20.. We agree with the general view expressed in (a) of the -preceding paragraph. With regard to the remaining three sub-paragraphs, whilst it is true that the scheme gives the British Broadcasting. Company unusual powers, we have had no proof that the Company have made any improper use of their position. It is fair to point out that the scheme for levying a contribution on apparatus from the manufacturers was imposed - by the Government as a condition of the broadcasting licence which the manufacturers desired, the position taken by the Post Office being that if they were to be granted the privilege they sought they must contribute at any rate a substantial part of the cost. It has been represented in evidence by the British Broadcasting Company and&apos; the National Association of Radio Manufacturers that opposition to this scheme has come largely.from firms concerned with importation, or from those who had no interestB 2
in wireless apparatus before the inauguration of the scheme. We have, however, been impressed by the general objections to the system of marking and royalties, and by the practical difficulties attending its operation. We do not consider it feasible or desirable to prevent the construction of wireless sets from ready-made parts. Yet it would be obviously unfair that users of ready-made sets should pay royalty to meet the oost of the broadcasting service while users of home-made or home-assembled sets should escape. The marking of all the minute parts of a set would be impracticable; but a suggestion has been made that about ten of the principal component parts should be marked &quot; B.B.C.&quot; and should pay royalty. We have examined these parts and have satisfied oursehes that nearly all of them could easily be sub-divided into two or more smaller parts, which could be sold without marking or royalty. It seems clear, therefore, that just as difficulties arose in the system of marking of sets through the use of unmarked parts, so difficulties would arise in a system of marking of component parts through the use of smaller unmarked parts.Controlling Authority.21. Parliamentary Control.- We have made it clear that broad--casting may be expected to become of great national importance -as a medium for the performance of valuable public services. It is essential, therefore, that permission to transmit, and the imatter to be transmitted, should be subject to public authority. It seems certain, as we shall explain later, that the bulls of the revenue for broadcasting must be collected by the State. More-over, the regulation of the power and wave-length of each -transmitting station must necessarily be undertaken by the Government, in order to avoid chaos. The ultimate control of broadcasting must, therefore, rest with a Minister responsible to Parliament, presumably the Postmaster General.22. Proposed Broadcasting Board Functions and Composition.  But the questions involved in broadcasting are so complex, and the decisions to be taken are&apos; so various and require so much technical and other consideration, that we are of opinion that a standing committee, which might be called the &quot; Broad-casting Board,&quot; should be set up by statute to assist the Post-master General in the administration technical, operational and general- of broadcasting, and to which the Postmaster General should refer important matters concerning the control of broad-casting for advice. Por example, it would advise on such questions as who should operate broadcasting, how many stations should be operated, how revenue should be raised and how allocated, what should be the general character of the matter to be broadcast and what regulations are necessary to prevent interference. It would become the authority to whom complaints and suggestions of all kinds concerning broadcasting would be
in wireless apparatus before the inauguration of the scheme.

It would become the authority to whom complaints and suggestions of all kinds concerning broadcasting would be
sent; and it is important that the Board should he so composed as to inspire confidence in the public mind.23. We would recommend that the Board should be composed of an independent chairman, preferably a specially qualified member of the House&apos; of Commons, nominated by the Post-master General, and of twelve members, of whom two should he specially qualified persons nominated by the Postmaster General, and the remainder drawn from the following interests or bodies: Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.County Councils&apos; Association.Association of Municipal Corporations.Trade Union Congress.Post Office. .Wireless Societies.Operating Concerns.Manufacturers.Press..  Entertainment Industry.We suggest that an officer of the Post Office should act as Secretary to the Board, and that the machinery of the Post Office Departments concerned should be utilised to assist the Board in its work. Service on the Board should, we consider, be unpaid.24. While recommending the establishment of a Board of the character suggested above, we think it right to state that broad-casting may eventually become so great a national responsibility as to demand ,the creation of a small paid body of experts, to whom (always, subject to the Postmaster General) its control should be entrusted.Operating Authorities.25. Question of State Opemtion.-Wh.erx once the principle of public control is established, it is evident that considerable latitude is possible in deciding by whom broadcasting should be operated. Suggestions have been made that the broad-casting service should be operated by the Post Office itself. The following are the principal arguments which have been suggested to us for and against such a policy : Fpr(i) While it is impossible to forecast with certainty the development of broadcasting, it seems clear that it will be utilised for matters of widespread public importance, and in these circumstances not only the regulation of what should, in the public interest, be broadcast, but also the actual operation of so important a national service, should be in the hands of the Government rather than in private hands.ra  20560 B 3
(..V.. (ii).. It appears that the principal means of obtaining revenue to cover the cost of broadcasting will bethecollec-tion by the - Government of licence fees from owners of wireless receiving sets; and it may be undesirable tliat the State should use its coercive powers as a collector of fees merely in order to find the necessary revenue for a private company.(iii) The Post Office undertakes the inland telegraph and telephone services, as well as certain wireless telegraph and telephone services, and it might be appropriate that it should also undertake broadcasting.Against(a) Whatever may &quot;be the. position as regards the operation of wireless stations, a Government Department would not be a suitable body to undertake the entertainment side; and a Minister might wed shrink from the prospect of having to defend in Parliament the.various items in Government concerts.(6) If a Government Department had to select the news, speeches, lectures, &amp;c, to be broadcast, it would be constantly :open to suspicion that it was using its unique opportunities to.advance the interests of the political party in power; and, in the endeavour to avoid anything in the slightest degree controversial, it would probably succeed in .  making its service intolerably dull. ...We&apos;consider that the objections to State operation of the.serviceoutweigh the advantages.26. State Control. At the same time, we think it essential that the Government control, which we have, already reeom-mended, should be definite in its character, and should continue to be secured through the licence which, under existing law, must be obtained from the Postmaster General for the estab-lishment of a wireless station. Further, no such licence should preclude the Government from using its own wireless stations for, the broadcasting of such information as may be deemed desirable, although it is recommended that care should be taken to interfere as little as possible with the broadcast programmes.27. Means of securing widespread reception with the cheaper types of Sets. In considering how to bring broadcasting within reach of the greatest possible number of people, it is necessary to take into account the effective range of stations on the one hand, and the price of sets adequate for reception within that range on the other. Crystal sets should be obtamable for little over 11. with a range of about 15 miles with stations at their present power. Within a range of 30 miles, single-valve sets are effective and should be within the means of a large pro-portion of the population. The crystal set, besides being inexperienced-pensive, is not covered by any live patents, is easily made at home, is not easily damaged or burnt out, requires no batteries
and entails negligible /expense/for, maintenance. It. is: at present the most suitable receiver for the poorer and. more numerous section of the population.  ,        ........28. London is .at present; excellently served by, its large station, but the provinces are less well served by their seven stations, since put of a provincial population of about thirty millions, less than one-third are near enough to a station to use -crystal sets. The remainder, including the inhabitants of many cities and large towns; among which we may mention Liverpool, Leeds, Edinburgh,. Bristol and Hull can only be served at present if they can afford to. buy valve sets and possess facilities for charging and maintaining accumulators. Indeed, even with expensive valve apparatus, there are places like Sheffield and Brighton which have difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory service from any of the. existing stations. Screening by hills, interference from stations engaged in ship-and-shore work, mutual -inter -ference of receiving sets straining to receive distant signals, and similar interference between the broadcasting stations them-selves,- all tend to make reception disappointing at many places. Taking 30 miles, however,, as the range within which single-valve sets are effective, some thirty million people, or about two-thirds of the total population of the country, could be served by the present eight stations if they could afford to use single-valve sets where crystal sets were not effective, ,29. Local Stations. It is probable that most of the difficulties discussed in the preceding paragraph might be avoided or reduced, by the provision of a considerable number&apos;of stations of lower power than those already existing. In the case of a town having its own station, the screening by hills., would seldom occur, and interfering /waves would be overwhelmed. The strength of each station ought to be adapted to. the size of its town, with due , regard to its proximity to other towns. cheap crystal sets&quot; would be suitable for the densely populated parts; amplifying apparatus for the environs.30. Belay Stations-The, possibility of linking by telephone lines a local broadcasting station with a studio or opera house in a distant, city has been demonstrated. Simultaneous broad--casting has already taken place on several occasions, a London programme being distributed from all stations. The extent to which developments in this direction are possible depends on technical factors concerning the Post Office trunk telephone lines. Development in, the direction of providing. many small stations linked to main centres depends largely,on the wave-band available, which is at present insufficient.- Subject to these -considerations, a local station could be used for local work arid also as a relay station operated from the- main centre. News and programmes having local colour could be alternated with general news and metropolitan programmes. The outlay * for the whole country would be large, both for wireless stations and for land lines, but since great numbers of persons could then
use crystal receivers, revenue from licence ee would be-correspondingly increased.&apos; &apos; !:31. Latitude of Choicc-liie Postmaster General and the Broadcasting Board will therefore need to consider a large policy for the future, which may involve the establishment of numerous smaller or subsidiary stations in addition to the eight stations which the British Broadcasting Company are now authorised to operate. We think that the greatest latitude should be left to the controlling authority in this regard, and that it would be unwise for us to attempt to define such a policy. At the same time, in view of the necessity for ensuring the continuance of an efficient service, we think it will be the natural and easiest course to continue, with certain variations in its terms, the licence to the British Broadcasting Company, who have the requisite organisation and technical and other experience. We deal at a later stage with the modifications we would suggest in the present licence. ,32. There are a number of methods which would be available to the Postmaster General and the Board for meeting the require-ments of the public in the future, such as-(a) the operation of large stations by the British Broad-casting Company or other authorities; or(b) the&apos;operation of smaller stations in different centres by the British Broadcasting Company, local Companies, Municipalities, Wireless Societies, or other bodies that may wish to undertake the work; or(c) the operation by any of the foregoing bodies of smaller stations (i.e., relay stations) connected with the larger central stations.The. allocation of the available revenue would present difficulties, but this would be one of the problems which the Postmaster General, with the assistance of the suggested Board, would have to solve.33. The conditions of broadcasting are so new, and its possi-bilities so far reaching, that the machinery to be created must allow for unexpected developments, for the unforeseen failure of experiments, and for the readjustment which such failures will entail.Alternative Methods of Meeting Cost op Broadcasting.34. Cost of Service. The British Broadcasting Company have been good enough, both in evidence and in writing, to furnish us with particulars of their expenditure and receipts, and we have  with their concurrence had their accounts examined by-Messrs. W. H. Kidson, Son, &amp; Company, Chartered Accountants.0 After considering the evidence and Messrs. Kidson&apos;s report, we* Note.-An audited Profit and Loss Account of the Company&apos;s business for the period of eight months to the 30th June, 1923, has been furnished to us confidentially, and has been deposited with the Secretary ol the Post Office, together with other documents laid before the Committee.
have come to the conclusion that, in order to cover the cost, of operating eight stations and the provision of programmes of about the present standard, and also to allow a reasonable amount for depreciation and to pay a dividend on the Company&apos;s capital at the rate of 1\ per cent., the revenue required for the British Broadcasting Company would be about  160,000 a year. Allowance must also be made for the possible establishment of local low-power stations or relay stations throughout the country, and even of new large stations. In addition to this factor, there is a tendency for the standard of programmes to be raised, involving an increase in then&apos; cost. We therefore consider that it would not be safe to count on less revenue being required in the near future than  250,000 a year.35. Should Cost be borne by Taxpayer. In view of the educa-tive value of broadcasting, the question arises whether the cost of the&apos; service should be met wholly or partly out of public funds. It has been suggested by certain witnesses that broadcasting might be regarded as. a public entertainment service, in the same way as the provision of music in. the public parks. Another proposal made to us is that the cost of the service should be charged to the Education Vote. If practically every taxpayer were a &quot; listener &quot; there might be no injustice in meeting the cost of broadcasting out of taxation. But under existing con-ditions it would not, we consider, be right that the general body of taxpayers should be required to pay for the daily service which only those possessing wireless receiving sets can enjoy. While, however, wq cannot recommend that any part of the &apos;C0st be borne out of public funds, we consider that the Govern-ment should not aim at making a profit on the control of the service or the licensing of wireless sets. This point is dealt with more fully in paragraph 44.36. Customs and Excise Duties. We have also considered whether a Customs duty might be imposed on imported wireless apparatus, with a corresponding Excise duty on apparatus manufactured in this country, the revenue thus raised being used for the provision of the broadcasting service. The duties would be -passed on to the purchasers of apparatus, who would thus automatically contribute to the cost of broadcasting. The evidence given by a representative of the Customs and Excise Department indicates that it would be impracticable to identify and tax all the numerous small parts which may be used in the construction of a wireless set, and that it would be necessary to restrict the duties to complete sets and to the principal component parts. All of these parts, however, with the exception of valves and probably head phones, are capable of sub-division into smaller parts; and this practice might be resorted to in order to evade the duty. In fact, the same diffi-culties apply here as in the marking of sets and parts. Futher, many of the parts are /used for apparatus other than wireless receiving sets, and it would be exceedingly.difficult to
levy or waive a duty according to the use eventually made of the apparatus. The collection of &apos;&apos; Excise duties&apos; would involve tho licensing of manufacturers&apos;and the inspection of their factories. &apos; The cost of collection would be high in proportion to the yield of the&apos; duties; the scheme would be difficult to carry out; and we cannot recommend its adoption. The question of imposing Customs duties, not for the purpose&quot; of meeting the cost of broadcasting, but in order to discourage the importation of foreign apparatus, is dealt with in a later section of our report.37. Licence Fees on Manufacturers and Dealers..- It has been suggested to us. from more than one quarter that a substantial contribution to the cost of the broadcasting service could be obtained by means of a system of licensing the manufacture and sale of wireless apparatus and by charging an appropriate fee to all licensed manufacturers and dealers. - It is further maintained that such a system would have adminis-trative advantages apart from its value as a source of revenue. The scale of fees suggested by one witness was 10Z. for a manufacturers licence and 21. for a dealer&apos;s or retailer&apos;s licence.38. We felt that this suggestion merits careful consideration on both grounds. In view of the peculiar conditions which attach . to a broadcasting service, there are . some obvious-advantages from a technical point of view in having a system under which manufacturers and dealers in apparatus are registered; and such a system would provide valuable machinery in the event of any development of the service which may take place in future. Moreover, although we are of opinion, after hearing evidence from&apos; the Board of Customs and Excise, that the cost of the administration of ,such a system would be some-what heavy, a material contribution towards the cost of the. broadcasting service could probably be secured.39. Notwithstanding these arguments in favour of &quot;the scheme, we are unable to recommend its adoption. We feel that any system of licensing, especially when applied to retail trade, is in itself objectionable on the ground of its restrictive character; and that administrative advantage alone is not sufficient to justify it. In general, the licensing of manufacturers and traders is, we find, adopted only where it is necessary to protect the revenue, and that justification does not exist in the present case. We were also informed by the Board of Customs and Excise that, owing to difficulties of definition and for other reasons, such a system so&apos;far as applied to retailers would be very difficult to enforce and that considerable evasion must be anticipated. Lastly, legislation, which could scarcely fail to be contentious, would be necessary. In view of these considerations we cannot recommend the adoption of the system.-40. Broadcasting of Advertisements.-In the course of our inquiry we have obtained&apos; information concerning the broad-
casting situation in the United States, Canada and Australia; arid ar;memorandum on the practice in&apos; those countries is furnished in-Appendix C Most of the broadcasting services, iri the United States and Canada&apos;1 are provided mainly to&apos; advertise the operating organisations; and in some cases revenue is obtained by direct or indirect advertisements of other &apos;concerns. An example of direct advertising would bV the broadcasting of a speech; by a representative&apos;1 of a Motor Company extolling the virtues of- his Company&apos;s :cars. An example of indirect advertising would be an announcement before a broadcast concert that it was being given free through the generosity of a specified firm.. We have received representa-tions from the Press protesting against the use of broadcasting in this country for advertising purposes, mainly on the ground that it would seriously affect the interests of newspapers, which rely largely on advertising revenue. They also contend that, while broadcasting in this country remains of the nature of a quasi monopoly, it should not be allowed to compete with newspapers as an advertising medium.41. There appear to be three alternatives, viz.: (a) that advertisements should be the main source of revenue of broadcasting;(6) that they should be barred absolutely as at present; and. (c) that they should be accepted only to such an extent as may prove necessary to supplement the main sources of revenue and make ends meet.       - we attach great importance to the maintenance of a high standard of broadcast programmes, with continuous efforts to secure improvement, and we think that advertisements would&apos; lower the standard.   The broadcasting of advertisements oil a large scale would tend, to make the service unpopular, and thus&quot; to defeat its own ends..  In newspaper advertising the small advertiser as well as the big gets his chance, but this would&apos; not&apos; be the case in broadcasting.   The time which could be devoted to advertising would in any case be very limited, and, therefore,1 exceedingly valuable; and the operating authorities,&apos;who. would&apos; want revenue, would naturally prefer the big advertiser who was ready to pay highly, with the result that only he would get a chance of advertising. : This would be too high a privilege to^ive to a few big advertisers at the risk of lowering the general&apos; standard of broadcasting.&apos;    We consider, however, that there would be no objection to the operating concern being allowed to 1 accept the gift of a concert and to broadcast a preliminary announcement giving the name of the donor; and alsoto broad- &apos; cast the name of the publisher and the price of &quot;a&apos;song&quot; which is about to&apos;be broadcast.&apos;      - &apos; &apos;&quot;42, Broadcasting of Commercial Information-A proposal has been submitted that a system should be introduced under
which commercial information and prices should be broadcast during business hours, occupying periods of, say, five minutes per hour. The information would be in code, and would be intended solely for the use of subscribers to the service. It seems possible that a useful facility might be afforded in this way, and that an appreciable amount of revenue might be earned. If it is necessary to find supplementary sources of revenue, we recommend that the institution of a service of this land should be allowed under suitable safeguards.43. Beceiving Licence Fees. We understand that the prin-cipal reasons, for the existing legal obligation laid upon any person who instals a wireless receiving set to take out a licence are (a) to enable the Post Office to impose on him, as a condition of the licence, the obligation not to divulge or make unauthorised use of any addressed messages he may receive on his set;(6) to give the Post Office power to prevent the use of private receiving sets in such a way as to interfere with the working of Government or commercial wireless stations in the vicinity; and(c) to have a register of owners of broadcast receiving apparatus available in the event of a national emergency.But although it is for these reasons that the obligation to take out a licence has been imposed, the fact that a licence is required has been used as a ready means of obtaining from owners of receiving sets a contribution towards the cost of the broadcasting service. It has been suggested to us that the licence fee is a form of taxation and that there is objection in principle to a Government Department handing over public revenue collected by it to a private undertaking. We do not think that this is quite a correct view of the position. Most licences are, in fact, principally required for administrative reasons. This, as we have explained, applies to some extent to the broadcast receiving licence; and while the position is peculiar in some respects, we do- not think it inconsistent with established principles . of administration that the Post Office should in effect use part of the fee to pay for the broad-casting service, whether provided by itself or by a private undertaking under contract, and retain the balance to cover its own expenses; and we have received no evidence of any appreciable dissatisfaction with this arrangement. We are clear, on the one hand, that if funds are required to pay for the broadcast programme they should be contributed by those who in fact receive it, rather than by the general tax-payer; while, on the other hand, it is part of the ordinary functions of the Post Office to make payment to private under-takings who contract with it to perform public services.
!fi 44. Amount and Allocation of Fees. A fee of 10s. a yearTis at present charged for a receiving licence whether broad-casting or experimental -and the Post Office has undertaken to pay the British Broadcasting Company 5s. a year in respect of each licence during the currency of the present agreement. The evidence we have received suggests that most listeners consider that they receive very good value for their money. We regard the fee as reasonable, and we recommend that it be maintained for the present. The aim of the Post Office should,, we think, be to obtain sufficient revenue from licence fees (a) to  cover administrative expenses with a safe-margin; and(6) to provide the necessary contribution to the cost of the broadcast programme. In the event of a considerable increase in the number of licences, the arrangements adopted should, we suggest, be such as to secure that the resulting surplus should be devoted-(i) to reducing the licence fee; or(ii) to improving the service; or(iii) to both these purposes.We understand from the Post Office that, so far as an estimate-can be formed on the basis of a very short experience of broadcasting licences, the cost to that Department of all work in connection with such licences ^including issue, recording, accounting, renewal, inspection, correspondence and adminis-trative control, is thought to be unlikely to exceed 2s. Qd. per year per licence. If the principles suggested above are-adopted, this amount might be retained by the Post Office and an amount of 7s. 6d. per licence would be available if required to meet the cost of all broadcasting services. We think: it right to add that the cost of administration will be deter-mined largely by the ease or otherwise with which the licence fees are collected, and that if there were any considerable degree of evasion, or if pressure to secure renewal of licences were necessary on any considerable scale, this estimate of the-cost of administration would probably be inadequate.45. In order to facilitate the fulfilment of the aims set: forth above, we consider it desirable that the Post Office-accounts relating to broadcasting should be kept separately.. This would accentuate the facts that the service was self-supporting, and&apos; that the Postmaster General and the Broad-casting Board were acting on behalf of the listener, by collecting and expending his money to the best advantage.46. Annual yield of Licence Fees. If, as we believe, licence fees must form the main source of revenue, it is essential that the service and the conditions of licence shall be of such a character as to attract a greatly increased number of licensees. It is difficult to estimate the number of receiving licences likely to be issued. The total number issued up to the present is about 170,000;   and there are about 30,000 applications
for experimental licences held in suspense, making a total of about 200,000. It is impossible to say how many persons are at present using wireless sets without a licence, but the number is probably nearer 200,000 than 100,000. If a simple form of licence were issued without any condition in regard to the use of marked apparatus, and if steps were taken to enforce it as suggested later in tins report, we consider it probable that within a short period the total number of licences would reach half a million; and, assuming that a high standard of pro-grammes is maintained, we. do not think it impossible that within a few years the number might rise to a million or more. A system under which the payment for operation is based on the number of licences issued offers an incentive for the pro-vision and development of an efficient and attractive service. We regard this as essential if the public is to be well served. At the same time it is unlikely that the cost of providing and improving the service will increase in the same proportion as the number of listeners : for this reason we suggest that, under any new Agreements, a sliding scale should be adopted which would reduce the amount accruing to the operating authorities per licence as the number of licences increased. After a certain point the question of reducing the licence fee to the publics would also arise; and in any case the sliding scale should be subject to periodical review.Conditions and Enforcement of Receiving Licences.47. Uniform Licence. In the event of the adoption&apos; of our recommendation that the marking of apparatus be abandoned/ there will no longer be any necessity for the issue of two kinds of receiving licences, one for broadcast reception and another for experimental work. We.recommend that a uniform receiving licence be issued, of the pattern shown in Appendix B, and that it be placed on sale at Post Offices and issued on payment of the fee without any formalities or questions. The adoption of this course will relieve experimenters of the necessity of filling in an elaborate-application form and sending it to the Secretary&apos;s Office, of- the Post Office, and will relieve the Post Office of the difficult and somewhat invidious duty of.determining whether applicants are genuine - experimenters or not.- 48. Condition concerning Interference. Much evidence has been tendered to us concerning the interference which is some-: times caused by the use of &quot; back-coupling&quot; (or reaction) in valve receiving sets in such a way as to radiate signals and to energise neighbouring aerials. Some witnesses have suggested that the use of apparatus in this way should be made a statutory offence, punishable by fine. Most of the witnesses, however, have expressed the view that the only effective means of stopping interference is by the education of listeners. Much has already been done in this direction, and there seems reason to hope that the evil will be overcome.  We recommend, however, that
a clause be inserted in the new licence irt the following terms :-&quot;The station shall not be used in such a manner as to cause interference with the working of other stations. In particular, back-coupling must not be used to such an extent as to energise any neighbouring aerial.&quot; Disregard of&apos;this condition should render a licence liable to summary cancellation; and,&apos;--we recommend that that penalty should be enforced in any case in- which a licensee can be proved to have repeatedly caused serious interference. - &apos; &apos;49. Suggestions have been made to the Committee that steps should be taken, by the insertion of a condition in the receiving licence, to protect property from injury or disfigurement through the erection of aerials; but we do not consider that such a condition could properly be inserted in the licence or enforced by the Post Office. &apos;   &apos;.&apos; &apos; 1&apos;\   &apos;As regards possible damage by lightning, the limited experience so far available seems to show that the risk is negligible. It is understood that most listeners take the precaution of earthing their aerials during thunderstorms.We recommend that a condition be inserted in the licence to the effect that an aerial which crosses above, or is liable to fall upon or to be blown on to any overhead power wire (including: electric lighting and tramway wires), must be guarded to the reasonable satisfaction of the owner of the power wire concerned.50. It has been brought to Our notice that certain local authorities and private landlords have demanded a rental charge for aerials. We think this practice is unjustifiable and should, be abandoned; otherwise it may become necessary to deal with it by legislation.51. Enforcement of Licence. We have been much concerned at the wholesale evasion of licences which has for some time prevailed.. We cannot, however, suggest any satisfactory means by which, the. Post Office could enforce its receiving licences so long as it can only issue the two existing types of licences-broadcasting and experimental the conditions of which cannot be fulfilled by some tens of thousands of persons who are using non-B.B.C. apparatus without a licence of any kind. In our opinion the-best hope of the Post Office being able to enforce licences with-out very serious friction is that it may be able to offer a simple licence-such as we recommend above- containing no marking conditions and available&apos;for-anyone to buy at a Post Office without any formalities. Assuming that such a licence is issued, we anticipate that the majority of persons who are now using unlicensed sets will take out,- licences without delay; and we recommend that the Post Office take all necessary measures to prevent further evasion, including the prosecution of wilful defaulters. A representative of the Customs and Excise Depart-ment has assured us, from a wide experience of the collection of licence, duties, that provided, a simple form of receiving licence is issued and suitable measures taken to enforce it, there should
be little evasion. We understand that the Customs and Excise Department have: statutory powers in connection with the licences they control (a) to call upon suspected persons to fill in a form of declaration showing whether they are liable to licence fee or not; and (b) to accept a compromise fine in cases of minor default as an alternative to prosecution. We recommend that statutory powers should be obtained for the adoption by the Postmaster General of both these courses&apos; in connection with the administration of wireless licences.:: 52. Wireless Telegraphy and Signalling Bill. Soon after the Committee&apos;s appointment we were asked by Sir William Joynson-Hicks (then Postmaster General) to consider, in so far as it affects broadcasting, the draft of a Wireless Telegraphy and Signalling Bill which the Government proposed to introduce for the purpose of amending the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1904. The Bill provides for the extension of the scope of that Act to cover wireless in aircraft, visual and sound signalling, and the use of etheric waves for non-telegraphic purposes. It also contains provisions to empower the Post-master General to make regulations governing the issue and withdrawal of wireless licences and operators&apos; certificates, and the observance of the International Radiotelegraphic Convention and Begulations. We are glad to have had an opportunity of studying this Bill; but the main proposals it embodies do .not   appear to affect materially the various aspects of broad-casting dealt with in this report. We recommend, however, that provisions be inserted to give the Postmaster General power to call for statutory declarations and to impose corn-promise fines, as suggested in the previous paragraph. We trust that the Authority responsible for the regulation of wireless telegraphy and telephony will realise the importance, in the public interest, of the development of broadcasting, and will make all necessary provision for the satisfactory conduct of the service, particularly in regard to the allocation of wave-lengths.53. There is one point in the Bill to which we wish to draw attention. Clause 2 (1) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1904, provides that where an applicant can prove to the satisfaction of the Postmaster General that his sole object is to conduct experiments in wireless telegraphy, a licence for that purpose ..&quot; shall be granted,&quot; whereas the Bill withdraws this special provision and provides that experimental licences, like all other wireless licences, may be granted by the Postmaster General subject to regulations which he may prescribe. We are of opinion that some alteration should be made in the Bill to preserve to experimenters the statutory right to the grant of a licence they at present enjoy under the 1904 Act. The point will not be of. any practical importance in the case of receiving licences if our recommendations concerning them are adopted; but it. may be . of. importance in regard to experimental transmitting licences.
Application of Recommended -Scheme.54. Position until end of 1924. We have had in mind throughout the position which will arise when the British Broad-casting Company&apos;s Licence expires on the 1st January, 1925. The action to be taken during the intervening period requires -special consideration. The Company hold a licence embodying the terms of the existing scheme, and are obviously entitled, if they so desire, to stand by their rights under that licence. In particular they are entitled to 50 per cent, of the revenue derived from all receiving licences. It is, however, clearly in the interests of both parties to the broadcasting licence and not less in those of the public that the system should be modified as soon as possible in such a way as to make it workable. After full investigation we have come to the conclusion that our recom-meridations would best meet present needs. They provide for a simple licensing system which would be capable of enforcement; and by removing existing difficulties and uncertainties their adoption should lead to a large increase in the number of licences, arid stimulate the sale of wireless apparatus.55. Results of immediate application. On the other hand it must be recognised that, as compared with the original agree-ment with the Post Office, the immediate application of the proposed scheme would entail certain adverse effects to the British Broadcasting Company and its constituent members, who are all manufacturers of wireless apparatus. The Com-pany would lose the royalties now payable by its members on marked apparatus: the constituent members, while relieved of the payment of royalties to the Company, would lose the security which the original scheme was intended to confer-but which in large degree it failed to give that the market in broadcast receiving apparatus should be reserved for them until the end of 1924. Manufacturers claim that on the strength of the licence issued to the British Broadcasting Company embodying the exist-ing scheme, they subscribed capital to that Company, and also embarked on capital expenditure in their own businesses to meet the anticipated demand for apparatus. The scheme having now become practically unworkable, they claim that the market should be reserved for British trade by some other means.56. Foreign Imports. It has been represented to us that, as a result of the uncertainty of the position during recent months, and of the absence of protection against foreign imports which .was promised by the then Postmaster General, Mr. Kellaway, for a period of two years, manufacturers now hold large stocks of apparatus on which they will sustain serious loss unless protec-tion in some form is given. In support of the rnanufacturers&apos; -claim, evidence has been furnished that a considerable amount of foreign wireless apparatus is being brought into this country, particularly head phones, which are imported in large numbers -and at low prices from Germany, Austria and Prance. It is also represented by the British Broadcasting Company that if the
official embargq on foreign apparatus were removed, dumping would immediately take place and the market , be flooded. Imported wireless valves and-variable condensers are at present liable to a duty of 33J per cent, ad valorem under Part I. of&apos; the Safeguarding of Industries.Act, and permanent magnets in head phones are liable to a. similar duty (i.e., 33-1 percent.), amounting only to a few pence per head phone. ^Suggestions have been made that, further import duties should be imposed;&apos;. but the Committee have felt that this question is riot within their com-competence, and must be left to be dealt with by Parliament as part of the general fiscal policy of the country; [i&quot;&apos; -l&apos;57. Suggested, marking .&quot; British Manufacture.&quot;-Another suggestion has been made that it. should be a condition of the broadcast receiving licence that if,the,set, is not marked.&quot; B.B.C.&quot; the principal component parts, should, be marked &quot;British Manufacture.&quot;. The same objections apply to this suggestion as to the suggested marking &quot;B.B.C.&quot; (see paragraph 20). All the component parts, with the exception of valves, and probably head phones, could be subdivided and sold, as smaller unmarked parts; there would be difficulty in defining what constitutes &quot; British Manufacture&quot;; and any. attempt to enforce the condition would involve, a minute... inspection by Post Office officials of the component parts of receiving sets, and would, we. consider, be bound to fail. We are unable, therefore, to recommend the adoption of any measure of this kind.58. Continuance of Service. Apart from the fact that the manufacturers have ground for complaint, and from any question whether the British Broadcasting Company (the. actual and only party to the Agreement with the Post Office) may or may not have a legal right to compensation,- a point which is not within our competence,-we are most anxious that there should be no risk of the whole broadcasting service breaking down, and would urge that ah equitable arrangement for, its continuance1 for the remainder of the period of the Company&apos;s licence, or for an extended term, on the lines indicated later in our report, should be agreed upon between the Post Office and. the Company. In this connection it cannot be overlooked that, the British Broad-casting Company is the only organisation that is.i:i a position, in the immediate present, to provide a satisfactory broadcasting service throughout the country. On the other hand it is obvious that in the event of the cessation of. broadcasting there would be a serious reduction in the sales of apparatus.59. Suggested terms for immediate application of Scheme. In order to provide sufficient revenue for the service if royalties were at once withdrawn, we would recommend that the British Broad-casting Company be given a larger share of the licence fee than the five shillings to which they are at present entitled. If they were given Is. 6d. per licence, subject .to -the application of a sliding scale on the lines suggested in paragraph 46, and if this alteration took effect from the 1st November, 1922. when broadcast receiving
licences were introduced, the Company &apos;s receipts from this source would be substantially increased, apart altogether from any future increase; due -to &apos; the greater number of;1 licences - which may be expected to be taken out; as a result of&apos;the introduction of a licensing system which is capable of enforcement1.&apos; It is desirable, however,1 that provision should be made many revised agreement with the Company that, in so far as the effective provision of a broadcasting service in any particular area is assigned by the Postmaster General and the Broadcasting Board to a body other than the British Broadcasting Company, an appropriate part of the revenue from licences should be reserved for that body.60. We recognise that the revenue which will accrue to the Company under these arrangements may be less than they might have received under the original scheme if the system.of tariff payments, with its accompanying restrictions on the apparatus to be used, had proved workable. Indeed, if the number of broadcast receiving licences had reached, say, half a million or more by the end of 1924, if the condition as to the use of B.B.C. apparatus could have been strictly enforced, and if the scale of tariff payments had remained as originally fixed, the Company&apos;s revenue would probably have been sufficient to enable them not only to provide.a satisfactory service and to pay dividends at the maximum rate of 1\ per cent, per annum allowed by their licence, but also to accumulate a reserve fund out of proportion to their capital expenditure. In this connection, however, it must be borne in mind [a) that the agreement gave the Postmaster General power at any time, after consultation with the Company, put without necessarily obtaining their concurrence), to call upon them to reduce the scale of tariff payments; and[b) that revenue which depended on the enforcement of &apos; ;   difficult or-r-as events have proved unworkable restriction-, tions could scarcely be regarded as reliable revenue.In point of fact the auditors report shows that no reserve fund of any kind has been accumulated. It is, however, unnecessary to develop this subject further, as we are given to understand that the Company regard themselves as a public utility service, and desire that their profits should be limited to a reasonable return on the capital invested.-&apos; 61. As regards the future, if- the Company1 agree to&apos; the immediate application of the scheme we recommend, we believe that &quot;their revenue&apos; will prove sufficient to cover the cost of an adequate service, and to enable them to pay a1 dividend at the rate of 7  per cent, per annum after making reasonable provision for depreciation of plant. It is, however, impossible to make any precise forecast, as the amount of revenue will depend on the number of licences taken out under-the new conditions; and any estimate of that number must be to a large extent guess-work.   For this reason we&apos;attach great importance to the
recommendation in paragraph 46 that the payment to the company per licence should be based on a suding scale which should be subject to periodical review. this arrangement would give flexibility to the financial provisions of the scheme, and should enable the postmaster general and the broadcasting board to ensure that the revenue payable to the company was neither excessive nor insufficient.62. when all has been said, however, the fact remains that the british broadcasting company are entitled, if they so desire, to refuse to agree to any modification of the terms of their existing licence. the arrangement we have recommended for increasing their share of the licence fees would, we consider, go far to counterbalance any adverse effects to the company of the suggested modification.another possible concession would be the extension of the period of their revised licence its terms being modified to admit of the adoption of all our recommendations by, say, two years beyond the original term, thus making the revised licence terminable on the 1st january, 1927. we would recommend the grant of both these concessions if the company on their part would agree (a) to the immediate application of the scheme recom-mended in this report if approved by the government.(6) to the revision of their articles of association (apart from any other alterations which our recommenda-tions may mvolve) in order to provide (i) that any dealer in or, retailer of wireless apparatushi this country should have a right such as is now possessed by manufacturers only to obtain at least one 11. share;(ii) that if and when any fresh issue of capital is made,subscriptions may be invited from the public, with a preference to the then existing shareholders; and(iii) that adequate representation on the board shouldbe secured for the new membership.(c) to the abolition of the deposit of 501. now required from members of the company.63. Revision of Company&apos;s Articles of Association. it is necessary to explain our reasons, for recommending the changes indicated above in the british broadcasting company&apos;s articles of association. the financial and other changes which we recommend in the relations between the government and the company will, if adopted, materially alter the situation. at present the membership of the company is limited to british manufacturers of wireless apparatus, because such manufacturers have to contribute, by means of royalties on apparatus (doubtless passed on to their customers), a substantial part of the cost of
providing the broadcasting service, and because only apparatus of British manufacture is normally allowed to be used under the scheme. The control of the Company is reserved for the six guaranteeing companies because they have undertaken to find the necessary capital and to secure the provision of a satisfactory service. Under our proposals the royalties would disappear, and the British Broadcasting Company would become an organiser and purveyor of broadcast programmes, the cost of which would be provided mainly, if not entirely, from licence fees to be collected by the Government. In these circumstances, while we think that it would be desirable for the manufacturing-industry still to take a leading part in the management of the Company, it would no longer be necessary to restrict it to that industry; and, indeed, we think that the Company would rest on a broader and stronger basis if membership were open also to dealers in and retailers of wireless apparatus. The existing provision limiting the dividends that may be paid by the Company to per cent, per annum should, we consider, be maintained; and, as indicated in paragraph 60, we understand that this is the Company&apos;s own view.Broadcasting Stations. Wave-Lengths and Hours of Working.64. Extension of Wave-length Band. The band of wave-lengths at present allocated to broadcasting in this country is from 850 to 425 metres inclusive. In order to reduce interference between existing stations and to admit of the development of the service, it is of great importance that there should be a consider-able extension of this band. Evidence on this question has been given by members of the Wireless Telegraphy Board (representing the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry). They are appre-hensive that an extension of the broadcast band would interfere with the facilities required by the fighting services, particularly if the band were extended downwards, in which case it would, trench upon the wave-lengths used for Army training. They have suggested that if, as we think, the allocation of additional wave-lengths for broadcasting is necessary, a band from 475 to 540 should be taken, in addition to the present band from 350 to 425, and that, until experience has been obtained of the effect of such an increase, an extension downward say from 350 to 300 should not be made.65. Unfortunately it is in the downward direction that the extension would be of greatest use for broadcasting. The fighting services would take over the control of all wireless transmission in war time; and as in peace time the use of wire-less for Army training does not occupy on an average many hours a day in each district, the Committee trust that the needs of the services can be met in some way that will admit of the desired extension of the broadcast band, which we regard as
of great importance in the public interest. Any: alteration in the allocation of wave-lengths will require the approval of the Imperial Communications Committee; and we recommend that representations be made to them with the view of obtaining the greatest possible extension of the broadcast band, preferably by the allocation of a band from 300 to 500, excluding 440 to 460; in view of the use of the 450 wave-length by direction finding stations. If this band is secured, it should be arranged as far as possible to use the longer wave-lengths for high-power stations and the shorter ones for smaller stations;66.. Interference caused by Ships&apos; Wireless Services.1 Complaints have been made that in districts near the coast the&apos; reception of broadcast programmes is seriously interfered :with by wireless communications between ships and coast wireless stations.&apos; There is a large amount of such work conducted on the &quot; spark &quot; system on a wave-length of 600 metres. The interference caused will probably be reduced as more ships&apos;are fitted&apos; with more elaborate and expensive apparatus operated on the &quot; con-tinuous wave &quot; system; but at present only a relatively small number of the larger ships are fitted with such apparatus. If the broadcast band were extended as suggested in the previous paragraph, it would be possible to use wave-lengths which would be less liable to interference by ship-and-shore work on the 600 wave-length. Much of the interference by &quot; spark &quot; transmission is due to the indefiniteness of tuning to the wave-length authorised; and we think it most desirable that the Postmaster General should exercise any authority, he may have to secure observance of the regulations. Where foreign coast stations are in fault, representations should, we consider, be made to the Administrations concerned.67. Extension of Hours. -Broadcasting is at present allowed on Sundays at any time of the day and on week-days during the period from 5 p.m. to 11p.m., with a further period from 11.30 a.m. to.12.30 p.m. in London and between 3.30 p,m. and 4.30 p.m. in the provinces. We understand, that the fighting services are now prepared to agree to the complete withdrawal of the restric-tibn of hours, subject to the right of the Government to stop broadcasting from any station temporarily if it is found to be causing interference with service training or exercises. We recommend that the hours be extended accordingly, thus enabling additional facilities to be provided,    i,..       &apos; Broadcast Programmes^-;6SV. - General .Gharacter.-ThB - --British Broadcasting Company have,-.-we think, achieved a large measure of success in providing what.the public want; and-notwithstanding.the serious loss of revenue they have sustained. through -the widespread evasion of licences and disregard of licence conditions, they have continued to provide a broadcasting service and have indeed - constantly-
improved it by giving programmes of higher quality and greater cost. The Company frequently invite expressions of opinion from listeners, and receive thousands of communications in response. We are informed that oh the last occasion of the kind 78 per. cent, of the letters showed that the writers were satisfied; - 20 per cent, expressed the opinion that there should be more or less of some particular class of matter; and 2 per cent, were condemnatory. It is stated that continuous efforts are being made to reduce the percentage of persons who are not completely satisfied;. but human nature being what it is the figures quoted may be regarded as not unsatisfactory. If, in accordance with our recommendation, a Broadcasting Board is established, they would no doubt study the, general.composition of. broadcast; programmes, consider the broad trend of any complaints received,, and make recommenda-tions if they considered any alterations desirable in. the general character of the programmes.   .: 69. News.-The British Broadcasting1 Gompany&apos;s licence pro-vides that they shall not broadcast news except such as they obtain from certain approved News Agencies. The Company have entered into an arrangement with these Agencies under which the latter pool their news, and supply the Company with it on certain terms,- subject to a condition that it shall not be broadcast until 7 p.m. This limit was imposed at the request of the news-papers, who feared that the broadcasting of news earlier in the day would seriously affect the sale of evening newspapers. We have received evidence on this point from the Newspaper Pro-proprietors&apos; Association, the Newspaper Society and the principal News Agencies. They claim that it is wrong in principle that any telegraphic corporation or other carrying system should engage in the business of collecting news and supplying it to the -public. The News Agencies and the newspapers spend very large sums in the collection and distribution of news, and they urge with justice that it would not be in the public interest that the broad-casting system, which will, at any rate for a time, be of the nature of a quasi monopoly, should be allowed to publish news otherwise than from authoritative and responsible sources of information. The public is well served by the Press in the matter of news, and we consider that any extension of the broadcasting of news should be carried out gradually, the effect of each extension being carefully watched. We understand that the existing agreement between&apos; the. British Broadcasting Company and the News Agencies, which imposes the 7 p_.ni. limit, will,remain in force until the 1st January, 1925; but we think that even before that date the Press might well agree to more latitude being given for the broadcasting of news, e.g., in the occasional broadcasting of special events without regard to the hour. .70. Censorship. The ?ost Office does not maintain - any system of censorship of broadcast matter; and the British Broad-casting Company&apos;s licence merely requires them to provide a programme &quot; to the reasonable, satisfaction of the Postmaster
General.&quot; . The Company have been careful in this matter, and there appears to have been only one occasion on which difficulty -has arisen. In that case a speech concerning the building dispute in April last was broadcast, and complaint of its character was -made in the House of Commons. The Postmaster General stated &apos;in:&apos;reply that he would draw the Company&apos;s attention to the -matter and request them to avoid the broadcasting of speeches on controversial matters. We do not consider that it is desirable to: maintain any system of censorship. Nor do we think it necessary to exclude everything that is controversial: indeed, there are few subjects on which controversy may not arise. It would obviously reduce the interest of broadcasting if it were necessary to exclude everything which might have a political bearing. On this question the position of the Postmaster General is one of some difficulty; and, while he must remain the final arbiter when any question is raised as to what kind of matter may or may not be broadcast, we think it will be of great help to him to have a Broadcasting Board, as we have suggested, who would advise him on such matters, and who would be free from any suspicion of political bias.71. Meteorological Information. The British Broadcasting Company are&apos; required, as a condition of then.&quot; licence, to broadcast weather reports without charge. The Meteorological Office has submitted a memorandum emphasising the value of this means of disseminating weather information, and expressing the view that when agriculturists, fishermen, holiday makers and others realise the value of these wireless forecasts, the demand for them and the use made of them will increase. We are strongly of opinion that weather forecasts should be broadcast at least twice a day in non-scientific language, calculated to be of the maximum value to agriculturists and others.72. Police Information. The Home Office has suggested that broadcasting might be used for simultaneous notifications to police stations throughout the country concerning crimes, criminals, or stolen property, and has asked that in any broad-casting system provision should be made by which it may be possible to secure the broadcasting of police notifications if such a scheme is found to be desirable and practicable. We concur in this view. The British Broadcasting Company&apos;s licence requires them to broadcast free of charge any notices issued by a Government Department; and we recommend that a similar&apos; provision be inserted in any future broadcasting licence.73. Information for Motorists.&apos; The Automobile Association have submitted that a system be introduced for the broadcasting di (a) bulletins of general information to road users concerning local obstructions and traffic difficulties; (6) messages to motorists whose whereabouts are unknown; (c) advice for the avoidance of certain roads or districts; and [d) information concerning lost or stolen property.   While we sympathise with the objects which
the association have in view, we are not convinced that the&apos; suggested messages are of such importance to a sufficient number of people to justify the use of the broadcasting system for their dissemination. -we recommend, however, that the question be further explored by direct discussion between the automobile association and the british broadcasting company, and that the result be reported to the post office or to the broadcasting board if established. .&apos; - &apos;    &apos;&apos; :74. Musical, Dramatic and Literary Productions. We much regret that the organisations representing the entertainment industry, and also the incorporated society of Authors, play-wrights and composers, have not seen their way to give evidence before this committee. the latter society. have asked the committee to note that owners of copyright are fully protected by the law of copyright; that this being so, literary property cannot be broadcast without the permission of its owners; and that this permission will not be granted unless adequate payment is made. we can only express a hope that it may prove possible to arrange equitable and mutually satisfactory terms with all persons whose talents are drawn upon for broadcast performances. indeed we understand that there is every prospect of an amicable settlement being reached at an early date between the british broadcasting company and several of the organisations. con-cerned, and that in some cases an agreement has already been reached.75. Gramophone Records of Broadcast Performances. a memo-randuni has been submitted on behalf of certain artistes and of the gramophone company calling attention to the fact that the copyright act of 1911 confers a copyright in a gramophone record to the maker or owner of the original plate, thus making it illegal to copy records, and suggesting that it be made illegal for anyone to make or sell a gramophone record of any rendering of a musical or dramatic work by means of broadcasting, except with the previous consent of the person rendering the work. we consider the object in view reasonable, and we hope that it may -be possible to give the suggested protection. we are not, however, competent to deal with the legal aspects of this question; and the post office has, at our request, communicated on the. subject with the government department concerned.summary op conclusions and recommendations.76. our conclusions and recommendations are summarised below :-future of broadcasting.(1) that broadcasting is of great value for purposes of instruction and entertainment, with great potentialities, and that
it will be in the public interest to encourage its development, under adequate control, and to facilitate its use for a wide variety of services.   (Paras. 3-91) ,   ... ,  &apos;    ; 1Existing Scheme.(2) That the&apos;existing scheme was based on an arrangement between the manufacturing industry and the Government, under which the manufacturers were to undertake to provide and main-tain a satisfactory broadcasting service, financed partly out of tariff payments on manufactured apparatus, and partly out of licence fees to be paid by listeners and collected by the Post Office : in return for the liabilities thus undertaken it was to be a condition of the licence that apparatus of foreign origin (with certain exceptions) should not be available for use under the scheme,-this to be ensured by the use of apparatus marked &quot;B.B.C.&quot;   (Paras. 13 and 17).(3) That the scheme was successful in securing the establish-ment of a broadcasting service of considerable merit which, having regard to the many difficulties they have had to contend with, reflects great credit on the enterprise and ability of the British Broadcasting Company&apos; and partly successful in ensuring that the demand for receiving sets during the initial period should mainly benefit British manufacturers who had established the service.   (Paras. 17 and 18.)(4) That the scheme has broken down in certain respects, largely owing to the unforeseen facility, cheapness and popularity of the construction of home-made sets.   (Paras. 14-16.)(5) That the consequent difficulties cannot be overcome by any system of marking component parts either &quot; B.B.C.&quot; or &quot; British Manufacture.&quot;   (Paras. 20 and 57.)(6) That the system of marking apparatus and deriving revenue for the broadcasting service from royalties on such apparatus gave the Company a privileged position; we have had no proof that they have made any improper use of it; but the system is open to&apos; objection from several points of view, and should be abandoned as soon as possible.   (Para. 20.)Recommended Scheme.Controlling Authority.(7) That a Broadcasting Board should be established by statute to assist the Postmaster General in the administration of broadcasting and to advise him on important questions concerning the service.   (Paras. 22-24.)Operating Authorities.(8) That the broadcasting service should not be operated by a Government Department, but that those entrusted with the
. service: should work under Government licence. (Paras. 25 and 26.)(9) That it is desirable that the operation of the existing service by the British Broadcasting Company should be con-tinued. for a definite period, subject to agreed modifications in the Company&apos;s licence, but. that, subject to existing rights, the&apos; Government should keep its hands free to grant additional licences, and should consider various alternatives for the operation in the future, either by the Company or by other authorities, of local or relay stations in addition to large stations. . (Paras. 31 and 32.)Financial Provisions.(10) That no part of the cost of broadcasting should fall on the taxpayer, but that the Government should not endeavour to make a profit on the administration of the service. (Paras. 35 and 44.)(11) That the bulk of the revenue required for the service should be-obtained from the receiving licence fee, which should be retained at 10s. a year, subject to consideration of a reduction in the event of more revenue being received than is sufficient to carry on an adequate service.   (Paras. 43-46.)(12) That instead of 5s. as much as Is. 6d. out of the 10s. fee might be allocated under any new scheme to meet the cost of broadcasting, subject to a sliding scale under which the payment per licence would decrease as the number of licences increased.   (Paras; 44 and 46.)(13) That certain supplementary sources of revenue should be the subject of early consideration.   (Paras. 41 and 42.)Conditions of Receiving Licences.(14) That in place of the present broadcast and experimental receiving licences a uniform and simple type of licence be issued and placed on sale at Post Offices without any formalities, con-taining a clause forbidding improper use of back-coupling on pain of withdrawal of the licence, but no other limitation on the apparatus allowed to be used.   (Paras. 47 and 48.)(15) That effective measures be taken to enforce such a licence, and that certain additional statutory powers be obtained to strengthen the Postmaster GeneraFs hands.   (Para. 51.)Application oi Recommended Scheme.(16) That the immediate application of the recommended scheme is most desirable.   (Para. 54.)
(17) That in consideration of the recommended modifications in the existing Agreement, the British Broadcasting Company should be given an increased share of the receiving licenoe fees and a two years&apos; extension of their own licence, on modified terms, if they will agree to the immediate application of the scheme, and to certain alterations in their Articles of Association, but with retention of the limitation of dividends. (Paras. 59, 62 and 63.)(18) That the Committee is unable to make any recommenda-tion on the desire which has been expressed for the protection of the manufacturing industry against foreign competition, feeling that, although it was an object of the existing scheme, it must be left to be dealt with by Parliament as part of the fiscal policy of the country.   (Para. 56.)Wave-lengths and Hours.(19) That arrangements be made for the greatest possible extension of the existing broadcast band of wave-lengths (350 to 425 metres), preferably by the allocation of a band from 300 to 500, excluding 440 to 460 metres.   (Para. 65.)(20) That all possible steps be taken to protect the band allocated to broadcasting from interference by other services. (Para. 66.)(21) That the present restriction of the hours of broadcasting be removed, thus enabling additional facilities to be provided. (Para. 67.)Frc grammes.(22) That the British Broadcasting Company have achieved a large measure of success in gauging the public taste and providing satisfactory programmes.   (Para. 68.)(23) That there should be a gradual extension of the broad-casting of news, under proper safeguards, and that more latitude - should be given for the broadcasting of special events without regard to the hour.   (Para. 69.)(24) That the Postmaster General. - should remain the final arbiter when any question is raised as to what kind of matter may or may not be broadcast.   (Para. 70.)-   &quot;-    ii77. Conclusion. In conclusion we wish to express our cordial thanks to the officers of the Post Office and of the British Broad-casting Company with whom we. have come into contact for their valuable evidence and for their wholehearted efforts to assist -us - in solving the problems with which we have had to deal. We are grateful also to the numerous representatives of other
organisations who have furnished us with much valuable infor-mation, either in oral evidence or by submitting written state-ments for our consideration.78. We have pleasure also in recording our high appreciation of the services rendered by our Secretary, Mr. F. W. Phillips. He has performed the heavy duties that have fallen to him with conspicuous ability, and has been of the greatest assistance to us both in the conduct of our inquiry and in the preparation of our report.(Signed)     F.

Reservation by Sir Henry Norman.... :, I cannot, support the recommendation in paragraphs 22 and 23 regarding the constitution of the proposed Broadcasting Board. In my opinion,&apos; a heterogeneous Board of thirteen members, giving voluntary service, eleven of them not necessarily with special knowledge of the subject and possibly without technical &quot;knowledge at all, presided over by a member of the House of Commons, who would, of course, be chosen from the political party in power, and whose tenure of office would be subject to political exigencies, would be inefficient, would carry little autho-rity, and its proceedings would therefore be for the most part futile. I feel sure that broadcasting will become so large and vital a part of our social life that, when licences are granted to a number of broadcasting stations, its day-to-day control will require the whole-time work of a compact, highly qualified and well-paid Broadcast Control Board, say, of three members. The cost of this body would, as has been explained, be borne by the licence-holders, and would impose no charge upon, public funds. I am therefore in favour of giving immediate effect to the suggestion of paragraph 24.(Signed)     Henry Norman.Reservation by Mr. J. C. W. Reith.My concurrence in the general conclusions is subject to the following reservation on clauses 14 and 18 of the Summary.I consider that the British Broadcasting Company, as an operating concern, might readily adopt any reasonable modifica-tions in the signed Contract which would simplify the regulations, widen the scope, and increase the popularity of the broadcasting service. They will probably welcome many of the recommenda-tions as reducing difficulties in constitution, operation and develop-ment. It is, however, useless to ignore the fact that the Company is composed of manufacturers who, at the request of the Post-master General, agreed to form and find capital for one company (with membership open to all British manufacturers of wireless apparatus), to launch the view industry, and to inaugurate and maintain the service on condition that such measures would be taken by the Government Department concerned as would, for a limited period, conserve the business of making and selling receiving apparatus to British manufacturers.That this was the basic consideration of the scheme is confirmed by the statement by the Postmaster General in the House of Commons on 18th July, 1922: &quot;I have informed the manufacturers that in the event of their supplying the capital required and providing efficient broadcasting services, I will
agree&apos;that the apparatus, which it will be permissible to use under the Post Office licence &quot;for the reception of those services, shall for two years be restricted to apparatus manufactured in&apos; Great Britain;&quot;&apos; &quot;It is inconceivable&apos; to me that we should-allow a new forniof communication in this country to be exploited by foreign manufacturers.&quot; -    &apos; &apos; &apos; ;   . .  &quot;   iThe recommendations of the Committee fail to provide for the fulfilment of this cardinal principle. In view of depreciated rates of exchange, such provision is essential for a limited period, if the new industry is to become established. The members of; the British Broadcasting Company are entitled to expect that the Government will fulfil its part of the signed Agreement. They have already suffered severely from evasion of regulations.- I submit that it is unreasonable to ask them to agree to radical alterations which do not include the safeguarding to British manufacturers in general of this fundamental issue, however willing they should :be to adopt any or all of the other conclusions as-may be found compatible With the technical and general&apos; efficiency of a broadcasting service to the people.        [ -(Signed)     J. C. W. Reith.Reservation by Mb. Charles Trevelyan.I must express my regret that my colleagues were unable to agree to the operation of Broadcasting by the Post Office. In my opinion a situation may easily arise in which this may be the only satisfactory possibility.The proposals of the Committee show the necessity for re-garding Broadcasting as a public service. It; is agreed that the proposed Broadcasting Board-will have to exercise a very effective general control over whatever system of operation is established.-The operating authorities will have in the public interest to submit to a large amount of regulation as to the matter which they broadcast. The mere technical process of transmission is the only region in which public policy can permit the-operating private company to have a free hand. n ... .iThe course of our inquiry has also established the peculiar position of broadcasting in the matter of revenue. The revenue will come principally from licences which will be levied by the. State upon hundreds of thousands of citizens. All the apparatus of enforcing collection will have to be available. Though the opinion of the revenue authorities was that the licences colild be successfully collected, their evidence showed that a considerable amount of not very pleasant spying and prosecution might be necessary before all the licences could be levied. There appears to be no precedent for the collection of a revenue by the State for the purpose of finding working expenses and dividend for a private company.
&apos; It is at any.rate evident, as, a,.matter, of public policy, that the; extent of the profits earned by.a company or companies for which, the State collects the dividends cannot be left, without unfit and, ought, in fact, to be severely circumscribed. Therefore the usual inducements of speculative, profits will not be offered to any private; company which undertakes operation. ;  .:&quot; This condition indeed makes it probable that the system&apos; of private operating companies may not continue indefinitely to&apos;, provide the necessary development. . It is even possible that the British Broadcasting Company might not come to terms with the Postmaster General on the lines laid down in the Report. The nation may be faced with a condition in which no private enterprise is ready to undertake broadcasting under the severe., limitations which appear to be necessary. . ..... There would not seem, to be any valid reason, except theo-retical objection to State operation, to the alternative of operation of broadcasting, by, the. Post Office. The capital outlay on transmission stations is small. The interest of a large public in the matter transmitted is necessarily so constant that there is no danger of slackness in the management. A public authority ,which failed to satisfy the listeners-in would be subjected to such a constant bombardment of public criticism that it would have to improve its methods. It would be more sensitive to such pressure than a private company.The Post Office would be able to employ the best technical managers and scientific advisers. It is in the position of being able to secure for the public the use of patents which may be necessary to improve the processes of operation.For these reasons, I consider that Parliament will find that it must either now or in the future, carefully consider, as an alternative to a private company or companies, the operation of broadcasting by the Post Office.There are various possibilities which deserve consideration -:       (1) The Post Office miglyt at once buy out and take -over the eight stations of the British Broadcasting Company , .    and operate them itself.(2) The Post Office might establish an extra large station or stations of its own, utilizing a different wave-band. There is no reason why the Government should not in the public interest at once start transmitting meteorological reports, police intelligence, business announcements and other services.(3) The Post Office might experiment in providng broadcasting in part of the country, e.g., Scotland, and establish a system of smaller relay stations. .It ought to be constantly borne in mind that at present the whole condition of broadcasting is experimental.   Eighteen
months ago that would have been obvious. It was then quite likely that a variety of authorities would have started trans-mission. Successful as the British Broadcasting Company has in many respects been, it would be unwise to conclude that others could not be equally or more successful. And to debar altogether the idea of transmission by the State is to restrict enterprise and experiment, and to exclude from consideration a form of operation which circumstances may presently make almost inevitable.(Signed)     Charles Trevelyan.

It is still carried on there on a much larger scale than in any other country, although the Committee is informed that technically this country is now equally advanced. A licence is required for the operation of a trans-mitting station in the United States, but no licence is required for any type of broadcast receiving set. Transmitting licences can be obtained without much difficulty, and there are at present between 500 and600 broadcasting stations in operation. The number of receiving sets in use is unknown but is certainly very large, one authority estimating it at about three millions. Most of the licences for broadcast transmission are held by Electrical Companies, Department Stores, Newspapers and Wireless Societies. Except in the case of Wireless Societies, which receive sub-prescriptions from their members, these organisations provide the service freo of charge, apparently in most cases in order to advertise their business. Some of them also broadcast advertisements of other firms in return for payment. The United States Government provides a free broadcasting service from the Arlington station, near Washington, the programmes com-prising lectures, market news, music, and miscellaneous information supplied by Government Departments.At one time the numerous broadcasting stations all used the same wave-length, with the result that they were constantly &quot; jamming &quot; one
another&apos;s signals. A wide band of wave-lengths has, however, recently been allocated by the United States Government to broadcasting; different wave-lengths are allotted to different stations; and the interference,due to &quot; jamming &quot; has been much reduced, although, according to some accounts, it is still troublesome. Interference was also caused by the use of receiving sets in such a way as to cause radiation from the receiving aerials; but as listeners become educated in the proper use of their apparatus the inters ference from this cause tends tp diminish.According to the &quot;Wireless Age&quot; of July, 1923, there are now eleven broadcasting transmitting stations in greater New York. Two of these, which are of $ kilowatt power in the antenna, belong to the Radio Corporation of America and transmit simultaneously from a double antenna on the top of the Aeolian Hall building the wave-lengths being 405 and 455 metres respectively.1 One gives serious addresses and classical music, the other the more popular features. Either can be connected by telephone lines to various public places in New York, and indeed, other cities. Another of the stations is that belonging to the American Telegraph and Telephone Company which, on a recent occasion, shared music and speeches delivered in the Carnegie Hall with the stations of the General Electric Company in Schenectady, the Westinghouse Company in Pittsburg, and the Chicago Daily News in Chicago, all simultaneously broadcasting.Canada. The Dominion Government has furnished the Committee with a memorandum describing the broadcasting situation in Canada. All wireless installations, whether for transmission or reception, require licences. A fee of 50 dollars a year is charged for a licence for broadcast transmission. Sixty-three such licences were issued last year, but there has lately been a considerable falling off in the number, and only 25 stations are now working. About half of these are operated by Companies interested in the manufacture or sale of wireless apparatus, and about half by Newspapers and Stores. As in the United States, most of the licensees provide a broadcasting service in order to advertise their own business. The recent falling off in their number is considered by the Canadian Government to indicate that &quot; manufacturers are beginning to find the expense of running a station a burden, and the novelty having worn off they are closing down their stations.&quot; The Government have recently allowed them, as an experiment, to earn revenue by the trans-mission of direct and indirect advertisements of other firms, on condition that no direct advertising shall take place between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.A fee of 1 dollar a year is charged for a receiving licence. The number of such licences issued last year was about 10,000; and it is estimated that the number will be increased this year to about 50,000. The Government maintain an inspection service, in the conduct of which they enlist the services of a number of amateurs as part-time inspectors at a nominal salary. These amateurs listen-in each night and deal with any local interference. It is understood that the cost of the inspection service and of the issue of licences has hitherto absorbed more than the amount received in licence fees. The Canadian Government have recently intro-duced a Bill to empower them, if desired, to pay a portion of the licence fees to a Provincial -Government, private company, or other party, for services in connection with the operation of broadcasting stations or the licensing and inspection of receiving stations.Australia. The Committee has been furnished with a copy of proposed regulations for broadcasting which, it is understood, were approved at a conference of the interested parties called by the Postmaster General of Australia at the end of May last, although they have not yet been formally approved by the Commonwealth Government. These regulations provide for certain wave-lengths to be allocated to broadcasting, and for each broadcasting station to use one wave-length only. Receiving licences are to be issued to the public at a fee of 10s. a year for the use of wireless sets
of a design approved&apos; by the Statutory Authority and capable of receiving signals on one wave-length only. Licences will be issued for the operation of broadcasting stations; and manufacturers and traders who desire to sell wireless apparatus will have to take out licences at a nominal fee. Receiving licences will be withheld from persons who do not pay the annual subscription to the authorities operating the broadcasting stations; and dealers and traders will be required to collect the first year&apos;s sub-scription on all receiving sets they sell. There will be competitive broad-easting services, and the operating concerns will be left to give the class of service which they think will bring them the greatest number of subscribers. Retailers will only be allowed to sell wireless sets.or parts to persons who hold receiving licences, and they will be required to keep a record of all sets or parts sold, together with the name address and licence number of the purchaser, and to notify these particulars to the operating companies concerned. Any person dealing in or using wireless apparatus without a licence will be liable to a penalty. The administra-tion of the broadcasting regulations will be entrusted to a Board comprising representatives of the Government, the operating concerns, manufacturers, traders.and the.
