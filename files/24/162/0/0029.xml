THIS DOCUMSiET IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS britannic MAJESTY^ GOVERMMETO..   . CABINET.SECRilT &apos;  HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. 1:2CP. 429/23. LONDON TRAFFIC BILL.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.In accordance with the recommendations of the Home Affairs Committee, H.A..CIS (2S) of July 27th, 1S23, which were approved by the Cabinet at their meeting of July Slst, 1925, Cabinet Conclusions 42 (23) (4), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport stated in the Bouse of Commons on August 2nd that the Government had decided to introduce a Bill on the subject of London traffic in the autumn session.   He also consulted with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury as to the practicability of pissing the Bill into law and arranged with him for the introduction of the Bill at an early date in the autumn session.The Draft Bill has been examined by the departments concerned and a draft will be circulated.    The Bill follows the proposals in Memorandum CP.340 to the Cabinet which was discusoed previously by the Home Affairs Committee, subject to certain alterations which have been agreed wit-h the Home Office.The only important alteration in the Bill is that power is taken .for the Minister, after taking the advice of the London.Treffic Advisory Committee, to issue licences to under-takings desirous of running omnibuses on the London streets and to attach as a condition to that general licence a    restriction of the number of omnibuses which may be run in particular congested streets at particular times.   The original proposal was to allow the Metropolitan Police to define routes botlb. with regard to their cOurso and their terminal points, and to make it a condition that omnibuses should run throughout the whole length of such routes, and, should maintain a regular service.   It mas hoped by these means that some alleviation of the congestion in the worst streets would be obtain.in.ed,.
Further discussion with the traffic authorities andwith tho London General Omnibus Company has, however convincedme that some power of limitation is required.   Such a power may involve a discrimination between persons desirous of runningomnibuses on particular routes and the Homo Secretary does notconsider that the exorcise of such a discrimination is compatible with the general duties of the Police,   If therefore the power is to be taken, it must be placed in the hands of the Minister.   i recognise that there are general objections to this power, since it will be argued that it gives the Minister power to confer a monopoly on existing undertakings, and strengthens the objection that the Minister is taking powers which are usually and properly exercised by-the local authorities.   While I appreciate the serious force of this objection and should have been glad toavoid the responsibility, I have come to the conclusion that theabsence! in a Bill dealing with London Traffic of any power toirestrict the number of licences, which licensing authorities elsewhere than in London possess, is illogical, and that as regards possible parliamentary opposition, its omission would cause more adverse criticism than its inclusion.I ask leave therefore to introduce the Bill ascirculated.(Initialled.)
