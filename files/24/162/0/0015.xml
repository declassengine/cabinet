THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYEDShe following extracts from the secret minutes of the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist party held on September 21st, indioate the extent to whioh the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Oonmittee Movement is controlled by the Oommuniet Party:&quot;Subject DecisionUNEMPLOYED ORGANISATIONfonHoeration of reporT report adopted.   On theprepared,by W. Hannington       question of the Unemployed and general discussion on      organisation running the whole future policy with   independent candidates, it regard to the Unemployed        was agraea*that Party movement, with special members in the Unemployedreference to the question of  organisations should work the Unemployed organisation    for suoh candidature&apos;a only running independent being promoted incandidates for municipal        exceptional aircumstanoea, bodies, and the suggested       and with the axprass programme of immediate sanction of the head-work, quarters of the H.U.ff.C.I.On the question of an appeal to Party members for fund to assist in maintaining the head office of the N.U.W.O.M. it wasagreed/
agreed that opparlrunity for*ihis. purpose he taken of the-^irPK)  ; &apos; oolumns of the &quot;Workers1 Weakly&quot; that would in future be at the disposal of the unemployed . organisation.     On the question of the general programme of work, it was agreed that the demand for the immediate summoning of parliament should be regarded as. a demand that would, arise fsom :    the general development of the campaign.rather than as a preliminary step in the organisation of the campaign. Also agreed to arrange for a discussion at the Bureau meeting on Wednesday,, September 26th on the policy: of the Unemployed delegates to the General Council of the Trade union Congress (comrades Hannington and Haye to &quot;-pxspare a statement on this matter in time for Wednesday&apos;a moe ting) on the quagtion of the formation of industrial groups; and on the attitude of Party members in regard to the proposal to start a new paper for the Unemployed organisation.&quot;JISMPMYKD.&quot;The Hew Iea.der&quot;, which printed the appeal made by E. Shinwell, LLP. for a one day strike to draw attention to unemployment, announced in its issue of October 5th that little support for the proposal has been forthcoming from any one from whom the paper invited opinions. Hanningtcn, however, has written an open letter to Shinwell whioh is reproduced in the Issue of &quot;The workers&apos; Weekly&quot; of October 5th, in which he states that the latter&apos;s proposal has created keen interest in the ranks of the National unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement. * Information from various&apos;sources indicates that, outside ooumunist. circles, there is practically no support for the proposed strike.Activity among the organised unemployed continues to increase and many more meetings are being held..Unemployed/
Unemployed &quot;news&apos;1 is an increasingly large feature in the extremist press:   &quot;The Worker&quot; of September 29th devotes a quarter of its spaoe to the activities of Scottish groups of the National Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement and a demand for the withdrawal of &quot;Circular 51&quot; issued by the Scottish Board of Education and dealing with the non-liability of the Eduoation authorities to feed and clothe children of able-bodied parents who are in receipt of relief from Parish Councils.It is not uninteresting to note that the recent decision to form a joint oommittee of the General Council of the Trade Union Congress and the National Unemployed Workers Committee Movement is claimed to have been partly &quot;a result of the help given by men like George,Hicks and A.A. purcell inside the General Council&quot;:   both these trade union leaders are reportod to bo communists.2he Unemployed Workers&apos; organisation,with which Sylvia Pankhurst is closely oonneotad, appears to be making some headway but the usual oharges of misappropriation of funds are already being made.     Sylvia pankhurst is enquiring for the addresses of empty houses in East Ham with a view to installing some of the unemployed:   she states that they have failed to &quot;wake up&quot; the authorities so far but will make another attack on the Guardians aa soon as they can: she proposes that the unemployed shall picket the* offices and stop the Guardians as they arrive and that, should this method prove iueffactivesthe unemployed shall visit the homes of the Guardians and, create a disturbance outside.The Batteraea branoh of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement were in part responsible for the scenes at the Wandsworth Board of Guardians on October 4th and Ootdber loth:   on the first date a deputationincluding/
1 t) 1J- 8 -including Hannington was refused a hearing despite the support of labour members.    When the Board re-assembled on October 10th the Chairman refused an explanation of his action in adjourning the previous meeting and the Labour members thereupon made business impossible by making an uproar with rattles, squeakers and whistles.    On each occasion there was a demonstration of unemployed outside the offices at which the speakers reviled certain members of the Board. There seems little doubt that, if the organised unemployed carry out their intentions, there will be repeated trouble at Guardians&apos; meetings. 3HB FTgD IKTHRNAT 10UAL OP LABOUR UHI0I3.The Mid-European Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions has sent a communication dated Berlin, October 3rd, 1923 to the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions regarding a conference to be held in Berlin on October 14th and 15th:&quot;Wo hope that you are well informed about thepolitical situation in Germany.    All informations showing us that the possibility of the great f:&apos;ght is oomihg.    Our interest is in this case to help and to assist the genaan proletariat so much as we be able.&apos;    Por this pu/pose it will be necessary to arrange a conference at Berlin on the 14/16th Catcher to discuss the question about our assistance for the gasman working class.     So this conference, also the tohonho* slowakian and frsnch comrades are invited.     We request you to delegate also one comrade, if possible Comrade Tom Man or Comrade Gallagher..     It is absolutely necessary that, one comrade of yor.r bureau, is doming to this sma.1 important oonfessns   and we are willing to assist your expenses in this case.&quot;The &quot;International propaganda Committee of theRevolutionary Textile Workers&quot; has addressed a circular to&quot;all national organisations and revolutionary minorities ofthe textile and Clothing Workers&quot; in whioh it is stated thatthe Committee is preparing &quot;to carry out from Berlin a more intensive agitation&quot; in the industries concerned:   theBri tlsh/
m   9   -British Bureau of the led international of Labour Unions has been requested to send the fullest possible information regarding the British textile workers.On September 29th the Miners&apos; Lodges affiliated to the North Eastern section of the Red International of Labour Unions held their monthly meeting at Newcastle and decided to invite all lodges in the County of Durham to attend a conference which is to be hold in the near future and at which Nat Watklns will probably put the oase for the Bed International of Labour Unions.    The Central Seoretary of the North Eastern section is in touch with the Newcastle listriot Organiser of the Communist Party with a view to setting up committees in all the local lodges. EXTREMISTS AND THE BRITISH &quot;FASCISTI&quot;.On October 7th about 500 people attended the inaugural meeting of the London branch of the British &quot;Fasoisti&quot;: Miss Bennett, a former suffragette, opened the meeting, but she and the two subsequent speakers were interrupted to such an extent by extremists that the meeting became pandemonium and ended with the singing of the National Anthem and &quot;The Red Flag&quot;.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT Britain there is   very little of interest to report this week.     The. Executive Council of the Irish Self-Determination League have decided to make an effort to oarry on and are seeking cheaper offices.   eMost of their time now is taken up with tho question of compensation for the &quot;English&quot; Deportees which will be decided next week: they are reported to have refused an offer similar to that accepted by the Scottish section and ere preparing to fight their olaims.    About fifty of the &quot;English&quot; deportees have signed/
Bigned the guarantee to contribute  50 out of their compensation money towards the Art 0&apos;Brien Defence Fund:   about  8,000 is required.The &quot;Soottish&quot; deportees held a meeting on October 6th at 171, Bmfield Street, Glasgow, and for two hours discussed the question of taking aotion against the London &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for libel.    No decision was reached, some of the most influential of them being opposed to such action on the grounds of the enormous costs involved.Concentrated efforts are also to be made to obtain the release of all prisoners, including those convicted in this country.     It is understood that no military operations aro to be started until this question is decided.George Humphreys, alias Hayward, who has been touring Southern Ireland to raise funds in aid of the. Republican journal &quot;Biro&quot;, is back in Manchester and says he has raised the bulk of the initial sum of  5,000 which is required.At a meeting of the Glasgow Irish Republican Army held at 171, Renfield Street on October 7th, a circular from headquarters was read warning all members that severe penalties will follow any disclosure of what transpires at their meetings, and also warning members about speaking of army matters in public.
APPEND LI&quot;THE UNITED STAPES OP EUROPE&quot; &quot; *Trotsky has written an article entitled &quot;TheUnited States of Europe&quot; which is printed in the currentissue of &quot;The Communist Review&quot;, as it is intended &quot;fordiscussion amongst the Parties of the CommunistInternational.&quot;    As the article may he taken as one ofthe keynotes of Russian policy some extracts wouldappear to hear quotation:&quot;I think that in conjunction with the slogan &apos;A Government of Workers and Peasants,&apos; the time is appropriate for issuing the slogan &quot;The United States of Europe.&apos;     Only by uniting these two slogans shall we get a definite, systematic and progressive response to the most urgent problems of European development....&quot;The motive power of the war consisted in the fact that the capitalist forces of production had outgrown the boundaries of the European national States.   Germany had set herself the task of &apos;organising&apos; Europe, i.e., of uniting economically the European continent under her own control, In order then seriously to set about contending-with Britain for world power.   The aim of Prance&quot;was to break up Germany... Victorious France is now maintaining her mastery only by Balkanising Europe.   Great Britain is inciting and protecting the French, policy of dismembering and exhausting Europe, all the time concealing her &quot;work under her traditional mask of hypocrisy.   As a result, our unfortunate continent is disintegrated and dismembered, exhausted, disorganised and bankrupt--transformed into a madhouse...&quot;To the toiling masses of Europe it is becoming ever clearer that the bourgeoisie is incapable of solving the. basic problems:&quot;of European restoration. The slogan &quot;A Workers1 and Peasants&apos; Government&apos; is designed to meet the attempts of the workers to find an issue by their own efforts.    It has now become necessary to indicate this issue more concretely, namely, to assert that only in the closest economic co-operation of the peoples of Europe lies the path to the salvation of our continent from economic destruction and enslavement to American capitalism.&quot;America is standing aloof from Europe, patiently waiting until her economic agony has reached such a pitch that It will be easy to step in and buy up Europe - as Austria was bought up - for a mere song...Europe/
labEurope is not a geographical term;    it is an economic term, something incomparably more concrete -especially in the present, pug b-war conditions - than the vox Id market.   Just, as federation was long ago recognised as essential for&apos;the Balkan Peninsula^ so now the time has arrived for stating definitely and clearly that federation is essential for Balkanlsed Europe.&quot;There remain to be considered the question of the Soviet TTnion, on the one herd, and of Great Britain, on the other.   It is obvious that the Soviet Union will not be opposed either to the federative union of Europe, nor to its own adhesion to such a federation.   Thereby, too, a bridge will be cheated betwean Europe and Asia.AtTransitional Slogan.&quot;The question of Great Britain is much more uncertain;    it depends on &apos;tha pace at which her revolutionary development proceeds.   Should the  &quot;Government of Workers and peasants&apos; triumph on the European mainland before British imperialism is overthrown - which is extremely probable - then the European Federation of Workers and Peasants will of necessity be directed against British capital- . And, of course, the moment the latter is overthrown the British Isles will enter as a desirable member Into the European Federation *&quot;It might be asked:   why a European Federation end not a World Federation?   Of course, as the world develops economically and politically, it will tend to become a world economic unit, and to become more and more centralised, depending upon the level of technical development reached...&quot;... If backward Russia did not, and could not, await the --revolution in Sit ope, all the more Europe will not, and must not, await the revolution in America.   Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Europe, blockaded by capitalist America (and at first, perhaps, by Great Britain) will be able to maintain herself and develop as a closely consolidated military and economic union...&quot;Hot merely the question of the Ruhr, i.e., of European fuel and iron, but also the question of reparations is envisaged in the scheme of &apos;The United States of Europe.&apos;   The question of reparations is purely a European question, and can be solved in be near future only by European means.   The Europe of Workers and Peasants will have its reparations budget - as i\ will have its war budget - as long as it is menaced by dangers from without. * This budget will be baaed upon a graduated income tax, upon levies on capital; upon the confiscation of wealth plundered during wartime, etc. Its incidence   will be regulated by the appropriate bodies of the European Federation of Workers and Peasants...&quot;...1 The United States of Europe&apos; - a purely revolutionary perspective - is the next stage in our general revolutionary perspective.    It arises from the profound differences.in the situations of Europe and America.   Whoever overlooks these differences, whichare /
are of such vital significance at the present time, will, willy-nilly, reduce a true revolutionary perspective to a mere historical abstraction.   Naturally, the Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Federation will not stop in \ its European phase.   As we have said, by our Soviet Union an outlet has been obtained into Asia, and from Asia into Europe.   VJe/,  cherefore, here envisaging only a stage, but a stage of great historical importance, through which we must first pass.&quot;
