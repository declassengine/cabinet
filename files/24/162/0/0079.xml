COMMON IffJS and the . EIB OTIONNone of tho communist candidates was successful in ths General Election but several were defeated by narrow majorities only and increased their poll:   below are given the votes recorded for the candidates who were claimed as members of the Communist Party in the official organ of that body and those polled by some of the sane candidates at ths last General Election:8* SaSiatvala (Battersea He)3c.

thai;&apos;:&quot;The Communist party feels justified in adopting any methods to fight the reactionary and capitalist forces.    It is wrong to say that the party did not have the Labour Party&apos;s sanction.   The C0P0G.B. supported Labour at the express desire of tha Labour Party.&quot;Just as labour candidates in the past have been victimised, so, now that we have the organisation and means, we are determined to adopt any methods to fight.   As a revolutionary party we must adopt revolutionary tact ics.&quot;On the whole the Cojrmunist party would appear to be not entirely dissatisfied, despite the defeat cf its candidates:   a prominent official stated on December 6th&quot;2ov? that the general Election is tver. cur immediate task is to consolidate bur gains,   The circulation of the paper has increased curing the past three weeks by 10,000 and we must hold that increase. Obviously it will be difficult to hold exactly the same 10,000 new readers-, owing to the fact that most of them obtained the paper at election meetings, but on the other hand you will probably have obtained during.the course of your efforts for the local Labour candidate a set of canvass cards showing Labour vptersa   Your task is to win as many as possible of these Labour supporters as readers cf the paper.&quot;The efforts of the Communist party during an Elect ion d p not end with the declaration cf the poll, neither do we measure our gains and losses in terms of votes or seats.   We measure our gains by the extension   of Party influence and our Party influence is measurable in terms of the circulation of the Party organ.   GET BUSY HOW WEILS! THE ELEGTIOI EKTHUSIAM STILL EXISTS and canvass every known Labour voter with the Workers&apos; Weekly.&quot;The two six-page issues of &quot;The workers&apos; Weekly&quot; published in connection vith the election cost the Party  150 more than the normal expenditure and agents ere being urged to clear up their arrears as soon as possible.On December 9th some 1,500 people attended a communist meeting in the Battersea Town Hall at which Saklatvala, Tom Mann, A.M. Wall and Mrs. Genley were the speakers:     the sum.of  10.2,0. v?as collected in the hall and .an overflow meeting was held outside.It/
It is reported from a secret source that Lady Tata contributed  200 towards saklatvala&apos;s. election expenses.In the Rusholme area 20,000 copies of William Paul&apos;3 election address were circulated and 10 issues of a paper entitled &quot;The Labour standard&quot;, of which 142,000 copies in all were printed.In regard to the expenses guaranteed by the Communist Party for their candidates in Scottish constituencies, the organising secretary informed Harry Pollitt on December 4th that:&quot;Tho amount originally guaranteed was as follows:Motherwell 325Dundee 500 (including 150 nom. fee)Greenock 200Eolvingrove 250Scottish daily ) .p and incidentals) 140Total       1,395&quot;Against this there has to he deducted the amount due for each constituency in respect of the Party Manifesto (see my letter of Nov. 29th) as follows:Motherwell  15. 0. 0.Dundee 32,10. 0*Greenock 13.15. 0.Kelvingrove 13, 0. 0.Total         74. 5. 0.&quot;This reduces the total payment to  1,320.15.0. Of this sum you have already received  1,100, leaving  220.15.0. still, to come.&quot;I em enclosing a cheque herein for a further  800.&quot;According to &quot;The Workers1 Weekly&quot; of December 7th the General Election fund of the Communist Party had then realised only 109.1.11.As an example of communist activity in the provinces interest attaches to the following report made to Headquarters by the organising secretary of the Salford group of the Communist Party.&quot;Salford/
ill&quot;Salford has returned Lahour Candidates in its three divisions.   Probably the most important is the defeat, by JoSi, Tools, of Montague Barlow, the Minister of Labour.   The Party members in salford have contributed in no small degree to the success of the Labour men.   It the outset we decided to concentrate on the sale of the Workers&apos; Weekly end the distribution of literature.   Each night the active comrades met and : were detailed off to the meetings.    In one night alone we sold 48 dozen &quot;Workers&apos; Weekly&apos;s&quot;.     In addition we disposed of 160 pamphlets for the women and distributed 5,000 manifestoes and 5,000 Party Leaflets. In a fortnight we sold 106 dozen copies of the Paper. All this was accomplished by about 10 workers.   And the way in which our comrades worked.    The boys made the streets resound with their cries.    &quot;Physical jerks from the neck upwards?&quot; one penny5     &quot;Here you are, how to live on 15 bob a week by Monty Barlow,&quot; &quot;How to be a Conservative on  100 , 000 a year, by lord Derby, one penny5&quot;     &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly for intelligent workers, one penny!&quot;   Our paper was received remarkably well.   At one meeting in quite a small school two of our oomrades were beseiged end sold all they had, seven dozen, and then had to announce that further copies would be on sale at the meetings on the following night.   We had quite as good a sale at Conservative meetings as we had at Labour meetings so we attended them all impartially.   Our Leaflets were distributed scientifically.   In the wast Division the Conservative, Commander Astbury posed as a friend of the ex-service men, so we were at all his meetings and handed out the Party leaflet &quot;A Pew Pacts for Ex-Servicemen&quot; and wherever we saw his photo exhibited, a similar leaflet went under the door.   Montague Barlow&apos;s audiences were supplied with the leaflet on Unemployment and 2,000 Unemployed Leaflets on which we had stamped &quot;Vote Labour&quot; were distributed to those signing on at the Salford Labour Exchange, which is in the midst of Ms constituency.   The special meetings for women were served with our pamphlets &quot;A message to working women&quot; and &quot;Wales Up a MrSo Worker&quot; also the special women&apos;s leaflets were distributed.   The above activities directed on the places specially chosen had a telling effect ana Salford has no capitalist M. a9&quot;OTHEB OOMMUIIST ACTIVITIESSome months ago the Executive of the Comintern decided that each national Communist Party must impose an annual levy upon its members for the Conmunist International: it was agreed that the levy on the British party for 1923 should be 1/- per member to be collected in two instalments of 6d. each in June and December:   the second instalment is now due and all local organisations have been instructed to^collect and forward it to Headquarters.It/
It is reported that the Communist Party of Great Britain is seeking information regarding the Pascisti and that&apos; in Bast Haa a member has been detailed to ascertain where they meet, the strength of their movement and the possibility of starting an offensive against them.Harry pollitt expects to return to London this week, though delayed in Scotland by various disagreements which arose during the election:   Paisley group&quot; apparently refuse to handle the Party literature and in Glasgow there is a good deal of dissatisfaction about the speakers who were supplied from the &quot;National Panel&quot;:   there was also trouble in Edinburgh.Robert Stewart, who is still in Moscow, is supplying information and articles to the Russian press and &quot;Agitation Department&quot; but finds his work somewhat difficult owing to the absence of reference books:   his son in Dundee is paid the sum of  1.10.0.. weekly by the British Communist Party.Sylvia Pankhuret is at her wits&apos; end for money and fears that &quot;The Workers1 Dreadnought&quot;, &quot;terminal&apos; and many schemes and hopes&quot; will not survive this week:   she is making a last effort to obtain money but has little expectation of success.BED INTERNATIONAL OP LABOUR UNIONS    .....The Chief Constable informs ma that on December lotha &quot;Hands off Germany&quot; conference was held under the auspices of the Red International of Labour unions in birmingham:   the meeting was convened by the BirminghamTrades Council and sbout 150 people were present including90 trade union &quot;delegates&quot;.   W. Gallacher and T. Bell spokeon tho position of the German workers and Brain moved aresolution, which was passed unanimously&quot;Pledging the meeting to assist the German workers in their struggle for power, demanding1thescrapping/
scrapping of the Versailles Treaty, the recalling of all British troops ixom Germany, urging all workers in flock drafts to prevent the shipping of munitions from British ports to German junkers, and calling upon the General Council of Trades union Congress and members of the Labour party in parliament to give energetic support to the proposals.&quot;S YOUNG COMMUNIST LEASUS.It is reported in the Press that the Executive Committee of the Communist League of Youth devoted its meeting at Moscow on the 6th December chiefly to a consideration of the League!s progress among &quot;Britain&apos;s youths and maidenso&quot;     It was declared to be a &quot;militant duty&quot; to double the membership of the Communist organizations for youths in Great Britain before May.   It was stated that the Communist efforts had been most successful in London, in the North of England, and in Scotland;, rihsre they had established 26 factory &quot;cells&quot; or &quot;nuclei.&apos;&apos;The League has drawn up a training syllabus and isstarting classes for young workers:   the syllabus followsthe lines of that already in use for adult communists.Special attention is being paid to the &quot;Children^Section&quot; of the League, which appears to be run by AnniePineberg who has contributed an article on the subjectto the current issue of &quot;Tho Young Worker&quot; in the course ofwhich she writes:&quot;It is an indisputable fact that the Children&apos;s Department is one of the most important branches of Young Communist League activities, and it is vitally necessary that children&apos; a soctions be formed wherever    ;, possible.   In the past the difficulty of finding the best method of educating the children of the workers to make them capable of playing their part in the struggle of their class was the main obstacle in our path. This question is now in tho hands of a leading Committee, which has drawn up an outline of our aims and methods to be employed,.   It has beon approved by the N.E.C.. and will in a short time be in the hands of every leader of a Communist Children^ Section.   I am convinced that this outline will be well &apos; discussed, and that comrades will communicate their opinions with suggest ions c
&quot;A very attractive task for the children would he the establishing of an International correspondence Group-.   Wo have received a letter from an organisation in Russia calling itself the &quot;Young i *       Pioneers,s and olso from some French oomrades asking for addresses of Communist Childron&apos;s Sections in England for the purpose of communicating with them. This could be made very interesting,&apos;and .T should be glad to receive letters, whioh will be forwarded to the proper quarter.&quot;H. Young has recently visited Motherwell, Blantyre, Greenock and Glasgow in the oourse of bis organising tour and is going to Paisley.Goldberg has gone to Newcastle for the purpose of league organisation in the North Eastern area.The Young Communist league claims to have given considerable assistance to Labour candidates in Scotland and to have supplied at least 100 young workers in greenock for Geddes.THE UNEMPLOYEDIt is reported that the Unemployed Workers&apos; Organisation finds it difficult to carry on as an independent body and is, in consequence, negotiating with the National Administrative Council for admission to the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement,IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT Britain there has beon nothing of interest in Irish Self-Determination League *nd Sinn Fein circles in this country during the past week.   One or two social gatherings (Ceilidhes) took placo to raise money for tho Dependents&apos; Fund.Joseph Fowler, the Acting President of the Irish Self-Latermination League has been trying to arrange a publio meeting, early in January, to be addressed by the youthful sons of de Valera and Erskine Guilders, but there appear   to be many difficulties in the way.Jams b/
James Lark in, of Dublin, ad d res so 0 a Communist mooting at the Stadium, Liverpool, on December 9th and spoke in his usual fiery style, denouncing everybody  and everything ho disagreed with, in particular the present Free State Government.The &quot;English71 Deportees are still anxiously awaiting payment of the sums allotted to them as&apos;compensation, and their less fortunate friends are also waiting to see what they can get out of them:   in Scotland, where the money&apos; has been paid over, tho Deportees are being asked to  epay all monies paid to their dependents while they W6ra in prison.   As far as the other Republican Funds arciconcerned, although practically every ono of the deportees\     - \promised substantial contributions, only one snip of $50 has as yet been received.The newspapers state that the Irish Cou: ordered Art OsBrien to repay  8,765 out of^H entrusted to him by Michael Collins in preused by him for Republican or other purpoJievent. IThe leaders of the Irish Republican Jj nand Scotland are quietly carrying out %M re-organisation, although, Judging fxcxM received, they are not malting much ne Brigades, Battalions, Companies, etc. sounding military phrases but their strength is not great.
