CABINET.E 0 R E T,
IcefelONNAIRE1.     The Committee had before them a reprint of the leading article from tho Police Review of the 23rd November, 1923, entitled &quot;The Policeman&apos;s General Election Programme&quot;, together Kith the Questionnaire addressed to all parliamentary candidates (E.B.C15) and Notes (E.B.C.13) by too Home Office on this Questionnaire.After considering suggested replies which- had been prepared by the Departments concerned, the Committee agreedTo recommend that the following answers should be sent to the six questions set out in E.B.C.15.(Where necessary notes for the information and guidance of candidates have been appended to thoreplies.)ill you, if elected -(l)   Maintain the principle of standardisation of Police conditions of Service for England, Wales and Scotland as recommended by the Desbor-ough Committee and embodied in the Police Regulations?(2)   Maintain the Dosbcrough Scale of Pay for the Policy Se rv i c e go ne ra 11 y?(3)   Maintain the Pension Scale embodied in the Police (Pensions) Act 1921 by opposing the imposition of an Age Limit, before reaching which a Policeman cannot retire on pension as of right&apos;Reply-These questions among others have been referred to the Lesbcroush Committee and are still under their considers -ticn - I think Inter Police may await with confidence the rnoomm&apos;.?nd:;ticns of tho Committee.
Question.(4)   Support the recommendations of the Dosborough Committee respecting a free house or an allowance in lieu, so that a Policeman stationed- in areas where house runts are high may not bo in a less favourable position than a Constable receiving a free house as part if his emoluments or an allowance which fully covers the cost of a rented house?(5)   Promote legislation to limit the authority now vested in County Chief Oongtables, whereby they may dismiss at will and without question any members of their Force, by reference of cases of discipline to the Standing Joint Committees, as is the case with the Borough Police?Reply-\   Yes, subject to any supplementary re eommenda11 Ons on this subject which may be contained in the coming Report of the Desborough Committee.NOTE:The allowances should be limited to the amount of a reasonable rent for a policeman to nay, and must be subject to any deductions which may by fixed as part of the measures for adjusting the emoluments of the Police as a whole.I am favourably disposed towards this suggestion unless , some solution of the difficulty, more satisfactory to all concerri-ed, can be found.(6)   Support an amendment of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1982, Section 191,  (4) of which, by giving Watch Committees the power of dismissal without appeal, is against the meaning thd spirit of Police Act, 1919, and the Police Regulations?It Is not quite clear what is required but in my view the procedure of Watch Committees should be such as to comply    &apos;   in letter and spirit with the requirements the of the PoliceActs.and Regulations.
PEG- tf/AE POLICEpsbsiohs.(2)     The Committee had under consideration a letter addressed to the Parliamentary candidates london the National Association of Retired Police Officers (1,3.0.14) asking for replieb to the three questions set out in that letterJAfter consideration of answers suggested by the Departments ooncorned, the Committee agreed:-To recommend that the reply to the National Association of hetired Police Officers should he drafted on thef0Hewing lines: -&quot;It would not he possible to prescribe different statutory conditions for different classes of pre-war pensioners.   The Government are anxious to secure that pre-war pensioners shall receive as favourable treatment as possible, and have undertaken to introduce a Bill for the purpose of increasing the benefits allowed hy tho 1920 Act,   The points raised in questiono 1 and 3 should be fully considered   in connection with th. t Bill.&quot;With regard to the second question, a proposal to award pensions to the widows of men who died or retired from the Police Force before the 1st September 1910, has been twice considered and rejected by Parliament during recent years;   and having regard to the largeexpenditure involved I do not think it wouldth- t I sh juld he right f   commit myself on the subject&apos;.t tho present stoge. &quot; &apos;
PENSIONSmuss)LL &quot;PROSPECTIVE3a     Inconnection &quot;with the discussion fin thePre-War Police Pensions questionnaire the Committeewere reminded that last summer in announcing thedecision to defer the Pensions (Increase) Bill tothe autumn session plodgea were givon that thelegislation should have retrospootive effect to 1st July, 1923*     Sympathy was exprossed with theview that the position of the pre-war pensionersin. 1 Ids respect ought not/to be prejudiced by the recent dissolution of Parliament.    Tho Committee agreed to recommendsubject to the viows of the Chancellor of  the exchequer:-That an announcement should he mode that itwas-the Government^ intention to endeavour toa Measure on&apos; the linos of secure the passage into law of/the Pensions(increase) Bill as early as possible next session and that the measure would haveretrospective effect to 1st July, 1923.NOTE:The views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer are being, obtained and will be notified later.
(4)     The Committee had under consideration the C;uestionnaire (E.i3,C, 16) addressed by the&apos; Bstional Union of Teachers to the Parliamentary candidates, and olso a letter dated 26th November, 1923, giving the views of the Board of Education on the Questionnaire (B.B.C17..)The Committee considered the draft repliessuggested by the Departments concerned and agreed to recommend that the following answers should be given to the five questions raised In EVB,C.16. -If elected would you do your bestby parliamentary means to preventyUSSTlOii.Any further attempts to elude from Infants&apos; ools children under six s of age, or to place the aching of children in the hands unqualified persons, or to crease the size of classes?1.   I am not ir favour of excluding children between five and six years of age from school, but the qualifications of teachers and the size of classes are questions of degree which cannot be considered with-out reference to the financial dositlon of the country * I hope that as the trade of the country recover-, it   will bepx-e-ible to resume the forward &apos; march of the educational serviceAny action reducing a2, *  I am In favour of the proper and effective adrrlnis-tration of the la?

Any withdrawal of tho present proportional Grant to Local E.ucation Authorities for the payment of teachers1 salaries?The percentage e,rant system is at present tire subject of enquiry by a Government Corn-mittoo and I must of so ursO await the Commit tee&apos;s report before expressing any decided views;     Personally I should be glad to see some system devised whioh would reduce the necessity for the present    1 detailed control of the expenii-ture of local education author.!--ties by the Board of Education,Any enactment whereby Local Education Authorities would be compelled to pay towards the cost of the State system of pensions for teachers?On thiS matter a strong Committee has just reported after very careful enquiry into the-whole position and I observe that thoy put forward a scheme involving oontributions by the teachers, the loc al authorit iss and the State.   This scheme should clearly be considered oarefully on its merits before any decision is arrived at.Are you&apos;in favour of extend-ing facilities for secondary education by increasing tha number or proportion of froe places and maintenance grants in Secondary Schools?Yes, as soon as the country can afford it.    It must not be over-looked that there has been a very large expansion in the pro-vision of Secondary Education and free places since 1914, al-though the country is now very much poorer.-6-
rlVl-OH-AIi      5.   The Committee bad before them the questionnaire -3:JS&apos; UNION&apos;[&apos;I0HiLiII23.   addressed to Parliamentary candidates by the National Farmers&apos; Union and the reply thereto.,, which had been prepared by the Minister of Agri culture - and Fisheries (E.3.0.20). .   .The Committee took note of and approved the reply in question subject to the re-drt.committing  of the answers to question? 5, 6, 8 and 11 as follows:-5.       This can be answered in the affirmative. The existing temporary exemption of tithe from rates under the Acts of 1920 end 1922 will terminate in 1926 .and will have to be replaced by some permanent legislation dealing with tithe.   In my opinion such .   legislation, while It should have regard to tb e hardships in this respect of the holders of small livings, should he so framed as not to place, any undue burden on agricultural land.6.       In Ry view every effort&apos; should be made to obtain equitable rates for the carriage of British produce.   In this connection it should be remembered that the Railway Hates Tribunal, on which all interests are ro-presented, has been established for the redress of legitimate grievances.8.       I agree in so far as an effective preference can be given with due regard to economy.11.       I agree that the Act of 1923 should continue pending any fresh adjustment which will not be less favourable to the occupier of agrfcul-tural land.Candidates are. strongly advised not to -ive an unqualified pledge as regards-the latter part of question 11 which raises&quot;highly important&quot;issues respecting national and local taxation, on v:hich it is desirable that a free hand should be retained.(Signed)CAVE      Chairman,on behalf of the Committee,iOUHE 02&apos; LLhfflS. .-  lumber 20th 19 23.

pQCTJlgKT .TH THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0 A B I H E T. EMERGENCY BUSINESS COMMITTEE.. POLICE PAY. ETC.,TH7? POLICEMAN&apos;S GENERAL ELECTION PROGRAMME..(A Reprint of a Leading Article which appeared in the&apos;Police review of 33rd November 1923).The Police generally are desirous of ascertaining the views of candidates with respect to oertain matters affesting their professional interests.     As Service conditions and regulations make it difficult for the Police individually to approach the Candidates themselves, we therefore invite your reply to the questions printed on the back of this paper.     Replies -sill he summarised and published in the &quot;Police Review&quot; before the Election.     Candidates who are willing to use this means for acquainting the Police electors with their views are asked to return this form by^Monday, 36th November, if possible.Of all the matters to be brought before Candidates seeking the support of the police at the forthcoming Parliamentary election the outstanding question is that of standardisation.     Many local authorities have passed resolutions in favour of a return to the old way in accordance with which they would regain complete control ore r the conditions of service as regards pay, age of retirement, allowances and hours of auty in the Eorce under their control.     The Police should be under no delusion as to the effect of such a retrograde step,The moat momentous conclusion reached by the Desborough Committee as a result of its very thorough investigation into the conditions of Police Servioe was that expressed in its recotoien-dation in favour of standardisation   as the alternative to national-iaation, and the best way out of the ehags and discontent into which the Police Forces of this country had sunk.     Now the arguments in favour of standardisation are every whit as strong to-day as they were four years ago and they should be pressedijjjULX&apos;Bjhlji-
upon all Parliamentary candidates lor their acceptance as a condition of Police support;     Even such a modification of this principle as ia now suggested by the proposal of the County Council Association to have two standard scales is not, in our opinion, to be lightly conceded.     If two, why not half-a   -dozen? We prefer the recent recommendation of the Scottish county Councils&apos; Association in favour of retaining Intact the principle of standardisation in its application to Police pay.Acquiescence in the principle of standardisation does, not of course,   bind the candidate to support the maintenance, of the peaborough scale.     That must be sought for as the second item of the Policeman&apos;s election programme.     The present scale of pay is admittedly a great advance on pre-war scales and ia certainly higher than the pay of an agricultural labourer, with whom members of Standing Joint Committees are just now fond of corn-paring    the rural Police.     But the let the Chief Constable of the rural oounty of Lincoln deal with this:-   &quot;as to direct prac-tical comparison between Police and agricultural labourers, there was none, because a trained country Policeman stood at the top of the scale of efficiency, and compared with an agricultural labourer he was at the other end of the scale&quot;    Quite so,    ana the truth of this needs to be driven well home in interviews with Parliamentary candidates.While Insisting on this we hope that in those areas where house-rent is out of proportion to wh^t is now allowed under this Head by regulation, the Police will put forward as strong a case as possible for such an equitable adjustment as will leave the Metropolitan and other Forces no ground for grievance by comparison with the rural Police.     Any representations of this kind will be loyally supported by the Police as a whole. The Sub-Committee of the Police Council which is considering this question will have their hands strengthened by any Promises of support which Members of Parliament may now give to   &apos;-2-
recommendations in favour of a settlement of this undoubted grievance on tarma shich the experience of the last few years would suggest as fair ana equitable.-Another important item on the Policeman&apos;a election Programme relates to age limit.     The County Councils&apos; Association is lending, support to a proposal which has been put forward in the interests it economy, by which no Police Officer would be ullowed to retire on full pension without medical certificate until he hud reached the age of fifty-five.     In the interests of efficiency which is the only true economy thi,j suggestion ought to be opposed tooth and nail.     No one who is really acquainted with the nature of Police &apos;sork, and has had opportunities of observing its effect upon the physique even of the best, will venture to uay that full ana efficient Police eervioe is to be expected up to fifty-five year of age.   The truth of the matter should be made clear to all Par-liamentary candidates in case legislation along these lines is introduced during the next Session of Parliament.In three directions we hope that Police legislation will be promoted in the hew Parliament, ana the support of all candidates at this eleotion might be invited.     We are of opinion that Ifcjbp MlfeQ ity,RQW.vested in County Chief, Cgns.ta.bles whereby they may dismiss at will and without question any member of their Force, ought to be limited, by reference to the Standing Joint Committees aa is the case with the Borough Police.     Why there should be such a distinction between the tso hinds of Police Force we are at a loss to understand.     There need be no*fear that the real authority of the Chief fcould be undermined in any way.   The com- ; position of the Standing Joint Committees is a sufficient safe-guard against that, ivhlle the verv fact that   nere exists such a reference will react beneficially upon the attitude of the Polios towards authority, and so promote true discipline.In view of the recent decisions in the Courts it is also desirable to obtain support for the amendment, of the Municipal goLUprationfi Ant, TAftP., Section 191 (4) of which is against the mean aud spirit of the Police Act 1919 ana the Police Regulations,

Dear Sir (or Madam).On behalf of the large number of Police Servioe electors in thin constituency who retired with a pension before, or in the early days of the war, we wish to draw your attentien to certain hardships which wo desire to see remove!.1.    By the Pension (increase) -*ot, 1920, small inoroases were granted to pre-war pensioners, but conditions and limitations were imposed which have never before applied to Police Pensioners:- *(a) The pensioner must reside in the British Islands;(b) The pensioner must have attained the age of sixty years, of have retired on aooount of physical or mental infirmity; or, in the case of a pensioner who is a widow, and is in receipt of a pension payable in respect of the services of her deceased husband, must have attained the age of forty years;(o)   The pensioner must satisfy the pension authority -., that his means, including his pension, are 1gS3 than  150 a year, if unmarried, or  200 if married.These conditions in numerous cases deprive the necessitous old pensioner of any benefit whatsoever.Would you favour the removal of those unwarrantable Clauses embodied in the Apt ?
2.     By the Police Pensions Act, 1921, pensions were granted to tho widows of men who die in the Police Service, and to the widows of those Constables who had finally retired after 1st September, 1918.   Tho Bill when it left the House of Commons justly extended a similar benefit to the widows of Constables who had retired on pension prior to the date mentioned, but by. o resolution moved in the House of Lords the older widows were cJebarred from benefit and left entirely unprovided for.Would you, if returned to Parliament, susporfr a measure which would rgmBdy this-i nj us ti oe to the widows of eld Policemen. ?3.     There are some thousands of Pre-war Pensioners whoso super-annuation allowance averages 2l/- a week.    In oonse-quenoe of the age limit clause in tho ^ct they cannot have their pensions increased until they are.60 years of ago. In the present state of the Labour Market employment is not obtainable and they are consequently in dire necessity,,-iflfould you endeavour to have the BUperannufttion.X11 owanee brought in line with the changed, conditions of living?In support of this appeal we would respectfully drawyour attention to Par. 184 of the report (&quot;Part II) of theDesborough Committee on the subjoat, which reads as follows:-&quot;we recognise that this question is part of a much wider ono, whiob has been ruled*but of our terms of reference, and we must content ourselves with stating our very strong opinion that the revision of the pensions of all Constables who have rendered the nation good service in the past, -should be taken in hand without delay, as a measure of equity and justice, and that the widows of Constables who retired before 1st September, 1918, should also be considered in this connection.&quot;That our claims wore just and equitable was abundantly proved by the fact that the G-overnment framed a Bill for the purpose of increasine Pre-rinr Pensions which, would have been int-jbduoed on Priday, 16th November, had not Parliament been dissolved.
Should you desire any &quot;further-explanation before giving an answer to our appeal, we should be grateful if you would appoint a time ahd reooive a deputation.Yours faithfully,W.J.H. iubjfek, Secretary.Please reply to the fofegoing questions and return this slit) to the Editor of the &quot;Polloo.

NATIONAL FARMERS&apos; UNION %UBSTIONNAIRE.The following notes and suggested.replies are circulated for the information and guidance of Candidates in connection with the above Questionnaires - &quot; .(1) Agree,. ..(2)&quot;&apos; I am prepared to support the proposals of thePrime Minister in his. Election Address.13) The Prime Minister has stated that it is not theintention of the Government to reinstitute any general system of control of cultivation or to Interfere with farmers in regard to-the choice of the crops they grow ,  and that a Wages Board will not be established if the labourers are in the ordinary course given in their&apos;&apos;&quot; &apos;&apos; 1&quot; &apos; wages their share of the subsidy.   At the same time the Government must be free to provide that the subsidy is not.paid to farmers whose cultivation falls below a reasonable standard, and to establish machinery to secure that a fair v/age Is paid, if this is not done voluntarily.The question can be answered in the affirmative, as the Government has no intention of reinstituting-control or wages machinery, apart from the proposed-, subsidy vshich&apos;should be more than sufficient to cover  ......any increased cost of production due to increased wages. It is estimated that for the country as a whole one half of the subsidy should be devoted to increasing wages and the other half will  be retained by the fanners, . though the proportions will vary on individual-farms,. *4) Agree.   An expert Committee has agreed on-a workablescheme for the purpose.This can be answered In the affirmative.     The
(6)(V)18)is:(10)112) (13)-existing tempo nary exemptions of tithe- from rates tiruier the Acts of 1920 arid 1922 will terminate in 1926 and will have to be-replaced by some permanent/legislation dealing with tithe.   In &quot;*, preparing such legislation the S-overnment will not include any /provisions which will place an additional rating burden on agricultural- land.This might be agreed to in principle though there are obvious practical difficulties in providing for preferential rates for the benefit of a particular class of goods.Agree..    Prior to the dissolution the Government had adopted the Bill for the amendment of the Merchandise Marks Act in the direction desired.Agree,   Provision-Is already made as far as practicable for preference, though in the case of meat it is not effective owing to the large difference between, the price of home produced and imported meat.Agree,   The principle has already been adopted under Section 9 fS) .of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1922, in cases where sealed churns are used.Agree.Agree that the Act.,of 1923 should continue pending any fresh adjustment .which;.will not be less favourable to the occupier of agricultural land,   It may be desira-ble to retain a free hand as to the details of the pro-posals in the joint memorandum referred to, which suggests a large   transfer of national or semi-national services from the rates to the taxes.Agree.Agree,On, the whole, therefore, Candidates can agree &quot;generally with the whole of the Questionnaire without going counter to the general policy of the government -o
