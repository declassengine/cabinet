THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SMEMORANDUM  BY   THE   MINISTER   OF   LABOUR.1,        I was asked for a statement on the above; bat there was not time to make it at the Cabinet on Tuesday, 23rd.    The matter is, however, of Importance, and I am glad to put the position before my oolleagues. 2.       From 26th April onwards I have been in constant touoh with the parties oonoerned in this dispute.Work and Overtime on a local basis had proceeded for over two years, it was deoldei in November, 1922, by the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades (of whioh the Boilermakers&apos; Society was then a member) to disouss an Agreement on these 2 points on a national basis.    An agreement was settled and was submitted to a pooled vote of the various Unions in aooordanoe with the rules of the Federation.    The result was deolared to be in favour of the Agreement on March 17th, but the number of votes represented a very small minority (only about 10 per cent) of the members concerned, and no ballot was taken by the Joiners^ Plumbers and Boilermakers.    On February 1st, when the Federation had definitely agreed to proceed%q7ernmmt.CAB I NET.BOILERMAKERS&apos; LOCKOUT.After negotiations relating to night shift. /with
with a national agreement, the Boilermakers announoed that they oould not be parties.   They reported this statement at a meeting of the Federation on February 16th, and on 14th March formally so Informed the Employers.    on Maroh 6th the Boilermakers gave notice to leave the Federation but the notioe under the Rules of the Federationcannot take effect for 6 months.    On Maroh 22nd the agreement was signed toy the Aoting chairman and Seoretary of the Federation on behalf of all the constituent members, including the Boilermakers.stopped work and the Employers announoei a look-out on and after April 3oth.    The Boilermakers maintained their refusal and deoided to take a ballot vote, the result of whioh was announoed on April 28th, as 14,565 in support of the aotion of their Exeoutive and 4,475 against.    The Joiners and plumbers eventually aooepted the Agreement of Maroh 22nd.my approval, met the unions including the Boilermakers and the Employers.     it beoame clear that, as the principle of oolleotive bargaining by the Federation of Trades with the Employers was at issue, no progress oould be made, and on April 30th the look-out came into operation.    The look-out only affeoted the 13,000 Boilermakers engaged on ships; the 60,000 Boilermakers engaged on land work, Hallways, eto.,have remained at work.3.On April 5th the Boilermakers at ShieldsOn April 26th Sir David Shackleton, with
4.        On 17th May the Federation of Trades, attheir Annual Meeting, decided to expel theBoilermakers and, on 30th May, they made it olearto the Boilermakers that this expulsion dated from may 17th and that therefore they were members ofthe Trades federation on March 22nd and houndby the Agreement of that date.5,        On 5th and 6th June the Boilermakers held a Delegate Conference and reaohed a decision that they were prepared to return to work underthe agreement on a time-work basis or to agroeto arbitration under the Industrial Courts Act. -On 13th June, in answer to a question byMr. Clynes, I suggested that the parties should meet and on 22nd June a moating took plaoewhen the Boilermakers&apos; proposals were rejected by the Employers.       On 1Oth July a secondballot of the Boilermakers^ was announced,tho result being 17,042 in favour of continuingtho dispute and 7,454 against.6,        On 17th July I met the Boilermakers1SxGoutive Committee, when they asked for aCourt of Inquiry.     I then saw the employers who strongly objected either to arbitrationor a Court of Inquiry.      Under the industrial courts Act I can appoint -(a) Arbitrators where both sides consent;(b) A Court of Inquiry into Fact withoutdecision on merits.     TS-ivs I can do without consent of either side./The
The Trades Federation has also objected to a Court of Inquiry.    On 20th July I confirmed by letter to the Boilermakers that the employers would not agree to arbitration, and that in my view the facts were dear and that this (at any rate under tho then conditions) was not a oase for a Court of Inquiry.7.        On 25th July Messrs. Clynes, Walsh, Short and Williams met me and asked for a Court of Inquiry and I repeated my view that the faots wore clear.      On 31st July I met Messrs. Henderson, Clynes, Short and Williams, when Mr. Henderson urged that the Boilerma&amp;ers retired from the negotiations in February and that they were not, therefore, parties to the Agreement.     I pointed out that on Maroh S2nd they were In my view still members of the Federation and therefore bound by the Agreement.        Indeed, I have made it olear throughout to the Boilermakers and their representatives that in my view they are bound by the Agreement of March 22nd.
8.     The Boilermakers continued to publish statements that their expulsion dated from the time, early in February, when they ceased to take part in the negotiations:   hat in August the Emergency Committee of the Federated Trades met and formally decided that this was not the oase.   On September 20th the full Executive of the Federation met and confirmed these decisions, whioh they communicated to me verbally and in confidence on September 24th.   I met also, on that day, the Boilermakers&apos; and Employers1 representatives but, in spite of the Federation&apos;s decision, it was impossible to end the deadlock,     r^e Boilermakers maintained that they had taken, early in February, every possible step to show that they could not be parties to the agreement and that the Federation officials had no right on March 22nd to sign on their behalf.At the end of the clay I proposed to the Federated Trades that in the statement to be issued to the press I should mention the fact of their resolution (viz. that the Boilermakers were expelled on May JRfth and therefore were bound by Agreement of March 22nd).     But they pointed out tnat their decisions had been communicated to me in confidence and that they did not wish me to publish them. It ia essential that both VJorkers and Employers should be able to rely on their confidences being scrupulously respected at the Ministry of Labour.   They said further that suoh publication would embarrass them in any further steps they had in contemplation for endeavouring to reach a settlement.   I accordingly felt I must respect their confidence and did not publish their resolution.     On September 28th the Employers met the Federated Trades, and,/in
in a letter to Mr, Luke Thompson, published without signature the decisions of the latter relative to the Boilermakers were made public by the employers. The &quot;Morning Post&quot; published ) statements -(a) That the Federation Executive wanted me to publish the Resolutions;(b) That I had refused to declare that the, Boilermakers were bound by the Agreementof Maroh 22nd.Both statements are the reverse of the truth.9.    On October 1st a Committee of the Trade Union congress general Council met the Unions and   on October 5th,that Committee met the employers1 representatives.     a delegate Conference of the Boilermakers was held on October23rd and 24th and In order that there might be no misunder-standing as to my position and opinion I addressed a letterto Mr. John Hill, pointing out that both Employers andthe Trades Federation were opposed either to arbitration orto a Court of Inquiry, and that in my view the resolution of the federation, viz. that the Boilermakers were membersof the Federation till May 17th removed all doubt as totheir being bound by the Agreement.   And this letterMr. Hill undertook should be read to the Delegates,     the delegate Conference has adjourned without definite resultbut they have put proposals before the General CouncilOf the Trades Union Congress which I gather amount tolittle more than a re-statement of their case, and of theclaim that they are not bound by the agreement of March 22nd./lO.   The
a j i10.    The dispute is one of peculiar difficulty owing not only to the triangular nature of tho dispute (which is really as much ono between the Trades Federation and the Boilormakors as between the Boilermakers and the Employers),: but also owing to the numerous cross-currents of opinion in the various camps.     The Employers&apos; Executive wish to fight to a finish? but more than one Shipbuilding Employer has told me ho would like to make terms with the Boiler-makers.     Some of the officials of the Trades Federation want to force the Boilermakers to accept the 22nd March Agreement, but many of the Executive of the Trades Federa-tion support the Boilermakers in their refusal to accept it.The crux of the whole situation ie :-(a) That many of the Boilermakers&apos; Executive, I ameatisfiad, do honeetly think they are not bound by the Agreement of 22nd March, (and some of the Employers admit the existence of thio honost belief).     They eay they are not lawyers, that the Federation Rules are loosely drawn, and that their notioeto the Employers and to the other Unions in February that thoy would not be bound by the National Agreement of 22nd March, should have been sufficient. Many of them feel thoy have been tricked.(b) The Boilermakers undoubtedly prefer local to national agreements; and dislike their interests as highly skilled craftsmen, being subordinated to those of the less skilled Unions in tho ; Federation,/These
These two reasons account for tho voting in the two Ballots taken by the Boilermakers .It must also be borne in mind that for the last 10 weeks the 60,000 land Boilermakers who have remained in work have contributed also each week to keep going the 13,000 shipping Boilermakers affected by the look-out ,     The Levy is small in amount being only l/- per man a week: but it is of importance as showing that the 60,000 land Boilermakers in work are behind the 13,000 ship Boilermakers looked out. 11.    I have been pressed to make a public statement published urbi et orbi that the Boilermakers are in. the wrong.    It is conceivable that circumstances might arise justifying such a public declaration but I have so far refused to make any such publio declaration, I am convinced it would be a dangerous course for the following reasons -(a) The Industrial Court Act, 1919, indicatesthroe activities for the Minister of Labour in Industrial Disputes -(i) Conciliation; (il) Arbitration, where both sides agree to it;(iii) Court of Inquiry into fact. I.have mado use of (1) throughout, but (il) and (iii)&apos; have been strongly opposed both by employers and by the Trades&apos; Federation.(b) The sole object I have had in view throughoutis to assist in securing a settlement of this prolonged and dangerous dispute.     But I am oonvinoed that a public declaration by/me
3 Dmo so far from helping to a solution would probably have had a, precisely contrary effect, and might easily have inflamed tho antagonism of the men whioh I showed above was of a stubborn character, (c) During the war compulsory powers existed; now I have only the powers of the Industrial Courts Act.     Industry must now return to normal conditions, and, generally speaking, the right policy for the Government is non-intervention.     Industry must learn again to settle its own disputes, especially as to wages and hours.     Unfortunately, those who call most loudly on the Government to keep its hands off industry aro often the first to clamour for Government intervention... if they think such intervention would score a point for them against the other side. If the Minister of Labour does take action in an industrial dispute, it must, (apart possibly from cases of dire national necessit be along one of tho three lines laid downin the Industrial Courts Act, i.o., either by conciliation, or by some sort of impartialtribunal or enquiry, (d) Mr. Winston Churchill, whon at the Board ofTrade, did in. the case of a big industrial dispute try making a pronouncement (embarrassing to the employers in that case), with most unhappy results? serious Irritation/was
was long felt by employers in conseouence, and this action of the President was one of the principal causes which led to the setting up at that time of a Chief Industrial Commissioner, of an impartial and non-political character, (e) Any precedents whioh I might establish now of public declarations adverse to the men in an Industrial Dispute would certainly be pressed to the extreme in the other direction should a Labour Government come into power.IS.     I hope the General Council of the Trades Union Congress may be able to force a settlement.     They meet on Thursday, and I am keeping in close touch with the situation.     If they do not succeed in forcing a settlement it may be that the grave state of Industry generally, and the serious public loss and wastage due to this lock-out may force re to reconsider the situation.(Intld.)
