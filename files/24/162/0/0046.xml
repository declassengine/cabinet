PALESTINEHote by The Secretary of state for tho Colonies.I circulated to my colleagues on the 27th October a memorandum on the future of Palestine (CoP.453/23), in which I proposed, (1) to address to sir EL Samuel telegraphic instructions in the terms of the draft telegram appended to the memorandum;   and. (2) to publish the relevant documents in the form of a White Paper before the re-assembly of Parliament, I now learn that there is unlikely to be a meeting of the cabinet this week at which there would be time to discuss this, matter;   and in view of the fact that Parliament re-assembles on Tuesday, 13th November, I do not think that,action on the lines proposed ought to be further delayed.   I accordingly propose, unless I hear by the morning of Saturday, November loth that any of my colleagues desire to offer objection, to act forthwith as proposed in my memorandum, via1: -(1) tb despatch the draft telegram to sir H. Samueljand(2) to publish the white Paper.,(Sgd.)     DEVONSHIRE.ISColonial Office, 7th November, 1923..
