THE TRADE OUTLOOK.COMMENTS BY MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY OOUNOIL AT A MEETING HELD ON SEPTEMBER 26th.. F.O. GOODENOUGH (Chairman of Barclay^ Bank). General Trade Position.report from Trade Centres mostly state that few fresh orders are coming in, but that there is still activity in certain manufacturing industries, and the building trade is fairly good.The Banking and Financial Position reflects the general inactivity whicn prevails in industry, excepting certain special branches.Deflation.During August a decline took place in Banking deposits, Advances to customers, Bills discounted and Acceptances.   This deflation is largely due to withdrawal of funds from trade for investment in best-class securities, and is an effect, not a cause, of bad trade.   Such deflation as has already taken place should not be attributed eolely to repayment of debt by the Government: trade depression is largely responsible.Fresh Credit Requirements.Banks should be in a position to meet fresh credit requirements if a revival in trade takes places, provided our currency system has sufficient elasticity: but there are no signs of any greater demand for such accommodation at present. There seems no reason at present to expect a higher Bank Rate. The American borrowing on the London market, which was in evidence earlier in the year, has undergone a check.Exchange Rates and Money RateB.Aocording to the index numbers, sterling appears at present to be under-valued.   American balances in this country have decreased; but European balances are high, and are likely to continue so till a settlement of the Reparations question and a reform of currency conditions in Europe tekes place.Japan&apos;s enormous monetary loss through the recent disaster is bound to have its effect in due course upon world values.There has been a notable change in the Amerioan trading position: importB into the United States of America for the first 8 months of the year amounted to $8648 million, and exports  to $2309 million - an adverse balance, as against a favourable balance of $471 million a year ago: this has assistec&apos; the maintenance of sterling.- Oosts and wages in the United States of America rose about 7fo and 12$ respectively during the past year: higher costs of production may have adversely affected the American export trade.The primary cause of depression is undoubtedly the loss of European markets, not to ourselves only, but to the whole world-restoration of European purchasing power is the first necessity.
Depreciated ourrencies abroad are an additional obstaole to British export trade: theoretically this condition should adjust itself, but in the case of self-eupporting countries I re-adjustment of internal values to the level of the depreciated,currency may be almost indefinitely postponed.Conclusion.It remains for ue only (l) to decrease our costs of production - if not by lowered wages, then by greater output for the same wagesj &apos;(S) to make for greater efficiency and eoonomyj and (3; to endeavour to develop fresh markets -notably by British Empire development, this country finding the flnanoial resources for carrying thiB policy into effect, and granting preferences in return for an increase of British population.1 THE HOW. CECIL BARING (Director of Baring Brothers and Company).Business had been quiet during August and September. Demands for financial oredit had been light, and the supply of commercial bills remained small.   The ourrencies of countries which do not balance their budgets had deteriorated, no doubt to the temporary detriment of our export trade.   Our own currency, measured in terms of the dollar, had shown the usual seasonal decline, but not to Buch a degree as it did last year; the   sterling being now worth ^4.56, against ^4.40 twelve months ago.   ThiB comparative steadiness of the pound might be accounted for by the restriction of our imports of cotton, stocks of which, at Liverpool and Manchester, were only some 70,000 bales against 330,000 bales this time last year. The present high price of raw cotton - l/6d. a lb. - was no doubt very injurious to the industry.   On the other hand, the advances in the prioe of tea, coffee, sugar and edible oils might be hailed as a satisfactory feature - the slight disadvantage to home consumers being counterbalanced by the stimulus given to international trade.   Good harvests were reported from some important oentreB, notably Canada, Germany and Prance.   News from Russia, though vague, was more hopeful. Reports from Austria were also encouraging.Stook markets here were idle.   High quotations for Government securities reflected the glut of money which might be more usefully employed in other channels.   In general, sentiment struck him as being slightly more confident than it was 2 months ago and he got the impression (an individual one) that trade would respond to a settlement of the German trouble.
SIR CHARLES ADDIS (Chairman of London Committee of Hong Kong and &apos; shanghai&quot; BankTng Corporation, Director, Bank of England).Reports boing received at present from clients were curiously contradictory.-   While most of theso were gloomy as to the general position, they frequently added that in their own case things were not so bad, as there were -compensating factors.   His Bank&apos;s figures for the last two months had shown a tendency to increase, and this seemed to go to show that the situation was not quite so unfavour-able as was sometimes represented.   With regard to India, there seemed on the whole, considering the season, to be a tendency towards improvement in exports, though there was no such improvement in the Imports of manufactured goods into India.   There was a noticeable tendency in that country for the course of silver prices to follow that of cotton: India and China were still absorbing silver, and it could not be forecast when the saturation point would be likely to be reached.In the Straits Settlements there had been an improvoment in rubber and tin. In China political conditions had prevented progress being made, but we were not losing ground. As regards Japan, recent advices went to show that the original reports as to the extent of the earthquake damage were muoh exaggerated and he thought the world would be astonished at japan&apos;s recuperative power.   The area affected was not large, and Yokohama was not an Industrial city, like Osaka or Kobe.   The silk trade, it was true, had its seat at Yokohama, and It was at first reported that stocks   thoro had been destroyed, but it was now found that the stocks in the godowns had not been very much injured by the fire.As to the cotton Spinning works, advloes were to the effect that 50,000 spindles had been destroyed; the total however boing it was understood, about 4,500,000, this proportion seemed to be very small.For these general reasons, Sir Charles Addis thought that the world position as regards commerce was no worse and on the whole rather better.   He pointed in particular to the lower forward price of cotton as perhaps an encouraging sign,SIR AUSTIN E. HARRIS (Lloyd&apos;s Bank).There were few encouraging signs, and banking figures stood much as they did six months ago.   There was little demand for advances, and commercial paper was scarce.   As exemplifying this stagnation he quoted the relative holdings of commercial paper and treasury Bills in one of the chief discount companies.   The proportion of commercial paper as compared with Treasury Bills was from 30$ to 40$ six months ago, but now only from 10$ to 15$.   This indicated the unsatisfactory oharacter of the position.
.T.W. BSADMONT PEASEENGLAND AND WALES.(Chairman of Lloyds Bank. Preeident British Bankers&apos; Association).lioulture.bBs &amp; Shoes.,4*5SJLuiTrades.Although generally considered hotter than 1922, the farmers in most dietriota have not had a prosperous year, and some are turning their arable land into pasture.   A good price la being maintained for sheep and lambs and the profits have been highly satisfactory.   DAIRYING, if not shewing much profit, has probably enabled the farmers engaged therein to - hold their own.    HOP GROWERS have done well with ,their orops, but the financial results depend on prices to be fixed by the Hop Controller.   FRUIT GROWERS  have again had a bad season.This industry has been quiet for some time in con-sequenoe of the bad weather and holidays, but there has been a good demand for summer goods, and although there isinot any marked improvement in the general condition at the moment, there are enquiries from abroad.The slump has not been ao severely felt in this trade and moat manufacturers have been kept going oomfort-ably.Speaking generally, trade has been satisfactory for some little time past, although the industry is affeoted by the reduoed purchasing power of the population.   There is an improssion that barley and hops will be cheaper; an advantage to the brewer.Theso are very quiet, and there ie little expectation of any general improvement until a further fall in prices has taken placej as far as Birmingham and the Midlands are concerned.   In London trade is active.There appears to be little ohange in the position of the carpet industry, and the oondition at the present time ia reported to be quite satisfactory; *eome factories still working overtime.   Many retail houses aro accepting goods that should have been delivered in the Spring, whioh points to the retailers1 stocks being low, and indicates every prospect of good re-sulte during the next eeason.   At the Liverpool sales held in the second week of September wool advanced about 10 per cent, and Bpinners have put up their price accordingly.The chemical trade (Manchester) has done fairly well in the export branch, but the home trade has been dull, especially in the textile districts.   Taken all round, prices have been steady.In the Newcastle distriot the ooal market la in a very uncertain condition and merchants are steadily
holding off in anticipation of a break in prioee. There is no groat undertone of strength on account of the absence of forward buying.   Advices from ^most of the Continental centres report heavy stooks on hand and consumption moderate, while the position is aggravated by the lack of distributing faoilities.   The demands for home requirements are upon a low level, especially for manufactullng classes.Immediate prospects are dull as regards WELSH coal.   Colliery owners, by reducing prloos, have secured more prompt business, and docks are well en-gaged on shipments, but collieries have not sufficient orders to follow, to absorb inereasing outputs. Export trade is considerably short of the levels attain-ed last spring, but shews distlnot improvement as compared with last year.   Although the immediate prospects are not particularly bright, colliery owners expeot to maintain trade, anticipating heavier European and South Amerioan demands.The production all over the world, and especially on the Gold Coast, has increased very materially during the past few years, but dwing to the disturbed state of Europe the consumption has decreased, thus aoootsnt-ing fer the low prioes now ruling, which are the lowest on reoord.   Stooks everywhere are heavy, and until the present state of things in Europe beoomea more settled we cannot look for any improvement either in consumption or price.The present position 1b a most favourable one for importing countries, for not only have they reaped good home crops, but they have every expectation of filling their everseas requirements on most favourable iterate, by reason ef the large cropB, Either actual or in prospeot of exporting lands.   Wheat supplies In the British Empire have been more plentiful during the past few years than ever before.   Splendid cropa have been obtained in Canada, India and Australia.   The home crop in the British Isles this year is rather small and represents about one fifth of the normal consumptive requirements.   With regard to the future, it may safely be said that Wheat production in some of the big exporting countries, particularly in the U.S.A., where growing costs are relatively high, la likely to decline in the next few years.   In Argentina, oattle owners have recently reduced their flocks and herds and devoted more land to wheat and oilseeds.    Russia has now rejoined the ranks of exporting countries and is likely to be a keen oompetlter, as production costs may be lower than in other countries where the standard of living: ia higher. Heavy exports may not be made this season, but undoubt-edly this oountry (Russia) will regain more of her former trade as time goes on, and with production also tending to increase in European countries, it appeert that there will be great difficulty in finding a market for the large surpluses produced In North and South.-Amerloa.
Cotton.      The Cotton trade, of which Lancashire is the &apos;&quot;&apos; industrial pivot, is passing through a most critical period, stretching back to the boom years, and the position looks like continuing to remain a difficult one.   The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association thought it imperative that production should be curtailed after June, and the American cotton mills have only been working a twenty-four hour week of late, but this expedient has not had the desired result.   It was expected that the shortage of yarn caused thereby would create or - stimulate sales, but even the restricted output has not been disposed of, a fact that shews that general orders are still below the average, Distant cotton futures are at a large discount compared with the near position, and stocks made from cotton bought in the dearer times will probably have to be realised at a loss.   As regards the importation of cotton, the American crop is expected to be a moderate one, and the latest advices are that rain is doing harm and the quality will be disappointing.In Lancashire trade may be said to be improving; fine spinners are generally working at a moderate profit, and some mills using American cotton may be making something, but the generality of spinners and manufacturers cannot yet claim to be working without some loss.   It is becoming more apparent that mills are suffering from the effect of over capitalization during the boom period, and that the overhead charges they are now carrying tend to keep prices above those offered by the markets,The general outlook in the spinning, weaving and Manchester goods trade is none too bright on the whole, though the position, as compared with what it was some time ago, has materially improved.Mr, Lee at the recent meeting of the Calico Printers&apos; Association laid stress on the great competition with Lancashire by manufacturers in Italy, Poland, Czecho--Slovak!a, France and India, and gave figures pointing out that the world ia reducing its purchases of our cotton goods except of the finest quality, and at the same time-is clamouring for our textile machinery with vmich to compete with us.w6-
Enamelled Ware.      Expectations are entertained of a revival of demand, &apos; &quot;    but at competitive prices.     Overseas trade is good.Engineering and Ship repairing are quiet, and far below former levels.    Eleotrioal engineers are doing fairly well, and marine engineers are getting a little more business than they did;   a good many firms, however, j are still short of profitable work.     The demand for MOTOR oars and cyoles continues, although the season grows! late, giving evidence that the seasonal oharacter of this trade is tending to ohange to one of a steadier nature throughout the year.    It is feared that, with the cut prioes, whilst the established firms will enjoy inoreased business, the younger firms, without reserves, will be detrimentally affected.     TUBS makers are fairly well employed.There is a fair enquiry for coasting tonnage and the market at the moment is rather firm in all directions. The Baltic demand is slow, but tonnage is steadily held -for late figures.     The Mediterranean ruled dull following ourront rates.1    Long distanoe trading is very dull at unremuneratlve rates.Trade is better than last year, but none too satisfactory, owing to the loss of Continental customers arising out of the oxohange position.The hosiery trade shews a general tendency to improvement, with better enquiries from the Colonies and other oountries, with the exception of the Continent.  )jjron and Steel.      The oondition of the iron and steel trade at the &quot;&quot;present time is one of considerable depression, with no rosier prospects for the immediate future.     There was a oertain recovery when the Prenoh first advanced into the Ruhr, and orders and output inoreased up to the month of July.     Sinoe then there has been a serious drop, and any advantage which was obtained from the cessation of German production now seems to have disappeared, owing to the general oonfused conditions on the Continent whioh make buyers generally timid.     Such orders as have been taken for Heavy Steel for the most part shew a very small margin of profit, and in many oases serious losses.     The competition between firms for suoh    \ orders as there are is so keen as to make the earning of reasonable profits impossible.In the lighter seotions of the &apos;trade, namely, Tinplates and Galvanised Sheets, there has been, on the other hand, very good- business, and this seotion of the industry presents, a more oheerful picture.Engineering.reights.ardware.osiery.wellery.Is still very depressed although some special lines
Pottery. Provisions.Saddlery, and Allied Trades,Galvanised Sheets /Shipbuilding.Timber.&quot;gin Mining.J&amp;egetable Oils.il oi-are good.   As a luxury trade, it Is always the last to feel any improvement, and at the present time fashion is acting detrimen-taliy to it.The home trade has been, and is still, quiet. Export trade is improving.This trade has had a very difficult time, Violent fluctuations of prices, coming as they have at frequent intervals,, have made the position of both importer and merchant a most unhappy one.So far as the home market is concerned this trade is badj but there is still a fair demand in the Colonies&apos; for cart gear, hames and chain work, in the fancy leather trade there is more activity In anticipation of the coming Christmas season.The position is improving and firm orders are being booked.There is still no movement, and the Boilermakers strike is holding up all repair work.Although a certain constant demand exists for those classes of wood used for building purposes, the timber trade suffera in the general depression. Owing to the state of the furniture manufacturing industry, the demand for hard woods is irregular and, in general, unsatisfactory.The prices closed at the end of August at about  190 being  10 up on the month, and the market is looking fairly firm.   The West of England mines are still progressing favourably, and absorbing the unemployment of the district.   Since then there has been a further appreciation.The demand for this oommodity, after being stagnant for several months, is now shewing signs of improvement.   It is difficult, however, to see any prospect of a permanent expansion in the demand until arrangements are made to improve the purchasing powers of the Central European countries.   The high prices quoted for oilcakes from America may possibly enable English manufacturers to compete for Scandinavian requirements during the next six months.Business has been very quiet and has shewn very little alteration, but as the London sales approach values seem to gain.   There are enquiries for all grades of wool, both for home and export account, and a notification of a new schedule for combing charges has stimulated the market.   The piece goods trade is very quiet prices shewing little profit for the manufacturer.SCOTLAND.The general trade outlook in Scotland la far from satisfactory, and in most industrial centres it is feared that general depression will exist In the coming winter.
pioneering.ijiiiing.The prospects of the coal trade in the West of Scotland are not very bright, because tho large coal-consuming industries, namely, the steel, iron and ship-building are practically at a standstill.   This condition affects the ooal trade of the East of Scotland, which 1b vory largely an export trade, beoause the surplus ooal of the Wost is being sent there.The present position of distilling is satisfactory on the manufacturing side.   Future prospects are hazy, Unless the extremely high exoise duty is reduced, a slump in the production of whisky seems inevitable.   The overseas trade is gradually reoovering.This -trade, both in Glasgow and Edinburgh, is very &quot;xivd&amp;K.   As to future prospects, firms would be glad to hear of any chance of a revival in trade) at present none can be perceived.The present position of the fiBhing industry in Scotland is very unsatisfactory. Apart from the bad weather conditions, which have adversely affected the industry during the summer months, expenses are still too high to permit of a reasonable profit, while the Railway rates render it unprofitable to send fish to markets in the South of England.The trade in pig-iron has been very quiet, with prices under cost.   During the last few days, however, there haB been a slight indication of a change for the better.   Enquiries from abroad have been received and prospects aro more hopeful.   Tho making of   hematite pig-iron has been reduced to a minimum.J1I&amp; Linen. Conditionsare in a somewhat stagnant state, and no improvement in trade 1b visible, buyers keeping aloof from markets.Pf1- The present position of paper manufacture in Sootlandis bad.   The condition of the industry nwy be described ao convalescent.   The recovery is slow.   Prospects were hotter two or three montnp ago, when the demand was improving, but an unexpected relapse occurred.   The recovery which had been made is lost, but the state of the industry is no worse than it was a yoar ago.The book-printing industry of Edinburgh has had a satisfactory revival during tho last few months^   The falling-off, which Is oustomary in the Autumn, is now in progress.   The condition of the trade generally is quite gratifying.   Commercial printing, both in Edinburgh and Glasgow, is fairly good.gilding. This industry 1b at a standstill, largely owingto the boilermakers1 strike, and general conditions may be described as stagnant.ro:a iThe outlook for the manufacturer is not bright) many looms on the Borders are standing idlo, awaiting orders which are few and not easily obtained.
125IRT. HON, SIR BRIO desire.(President of the Council of the Federation of British Industries. Director of Dunlop Rubber Company, Limited).Since July, when the last Report was submitted, the situation has on the whole developed for the worse.   Although here and there, there have been bright spots to which reference will be subsequently made, in the main it must be admitted that the situation goes from bad to worse.   The most serious feature is the increasingly depressed conditions existing in the great textile industries.   For many months now all these industries have suffered acutely from the inability of their Overseas customers to purchase their products, while in some cases certain branches of these industries have had to face the competition of goods dumped in this country by foreign nations whose rate of exchange give them a temporary advantage,   In many cases this temporary advantage has been sufficient to completely disorganise the whole market, although it is doubtful whether the foreign competitor will for long be able to maintain the supplies,&apos; What appears to be happening in most cases is that one country and then another is able to dispose of a large quantity of goods at a very low price in England because&apos;of the fall in the value of its currency unit,   A few months later the retailer who.has purchased his aupplieB from that country finds that that country is no longer able to supply him, but there is another country which can step into the breach and supply goods at prices with which it is impossible for the English manufacturer to compete.   The nett result from the British manufacturers&apos; point of view is that month after month passes and the number of orders for future delivery grow less and less. A manufacturer must have orders on his books at least three or four months ahead of the time they are to be delivered if he is to carry on his business on a sound basis.   At the present time the majority of the textile firms have hardly any orders at all coming forward.It must be Been that the British manufacturer ie faced with the loss of his Home markets and also with the loss of his overseas markets owing to the precarious condition of the world and the impoverishment of the various nations.   There is no need to describe the condition in Europe,   The Near East is- ^ in a completely chaotic condition and practically no orders are coming thence.   In China, unsettled conditions, coupled with money stringency, have gradually curtailed what was once a very large market at any rate for the cotton trade.   The recent oatastrophe in Japan, while it may be temporarily favourable to the constructional trades, is bound to injure the sale of our cotton and woollen goods because the spending power of Japan must inevitably be reduced and the methods of her merchant houses and banking institutions has been completely disorganised.In the main, it must be said that it is our Overseas Dominions whioh at present are our best customers, but even here the demand is patchy.   In India the political situation together with a genuine financial stringency is having a most depressing influence on British Trade, while most of the self-governed Dominions which formerly sold a considerable quantity&apos; of raw materials to the Continent find their spending power restricted through the inability of the Continent to purchase&apos; its former quota.In South America the British manufacturer is faced with competition from the United States, and in many cases the financial
-position, in the yarious t*outh American States has grown very much worse in the last few months. Examples are Brazil and the Argentine.Speaking generally, it may be said that.the most striking development of the last two or three months has been the steady decline in business in all the great textile trades.   It is no longer the oase that only one or two seotions have suffered; the depression is practioally universal.   Cotton, our biggest export, and wool, are both in a very parlous condition, their position being made more difficult by the rise in price of their raw materials which results in the finished goods costing so much that an, impoverished world cannot afford to purchase them.I will now give a very brief survey of the main industriess-Cotton.   The raw cotton remains firm with prices tending to rise, while business in the cloth market has been irregular. Enquiries have become even less in the last month than in the month before.   In India most of the offers in shirtings have had to be refused owing to the low price and any revival in Indian trade is not expected before October,   Shippers in China are only purchasing from hand to mouthj the most that can be said is that there does seem to be a very slow development.   No buying of importance is taking place for the Levant and the demand from Singapore and the Dutch East Indies has tapered away.   Limited business continues to be done Is specialities for the United States and there is a limited amount of business for central and South America.   The Home Trade Section has been very quiet. Amongst spinners an organized curtailment of production has continued, and during September the Master Spinners&apos; Federation have instructed members to restrict output to 50$,   On the whole, Egyptian cotton is selling best.   The yarn market is particularly unsettled and wide fluctuations are taking place.   As things stand at the present time the conditions could scareely he worse from the point of view of spinners and manufacturers.   There is considerable nervousness with regard to the probable outcome of the European political situation. There has been no buying of importance since last January and it is recognised that the consumption of manufactured goods will be restricted if it is not possible for merchants to operate on a cheaper basis.Wool.   What has been said above as regards the cotton industry&quot; can also be said to apply to the Wool Trade.   The disorganized condition of European exohange has enabled France and Belgium to place dress goods and manufactured articles on the British and neutral markets at prices far below the cost of production in Yorkshire and at the same time the purchasing power of Germany - in pre-war days by far the most important outlet for British semi-manufactured goods and a clearing centre for Northern Europe - is continually diminishing.   Even now Germany remains one of our best customers and until the end of last yeSr her powers of absorption were expanding in a very satisfactory manner. The disastrous effect of the Ruhr occupation on our export trade in this direction is clearly illustrated by the following comparative tables for exports of tops and worsted yarns:-Exports to Germany from the United Kingdom.Period Tops Worsted YarnsJan. - July Centals of 100 lbs. lbs.1913 93,393 17,736,0001920 29,270 1,805,00019.21 3P,037 3,231,1001922 66,569 9,910,2001923 35,534 6,357,700
The raw material market shows no sign of weakness and indeed many topmakers are re-selling stocks of wool for lack of incentive to turn them into tops, a policy whioh, though it may not prove unprofitable to the individual sellers, naturally increases unemployment.The export demand for wool continues unabatedj   the total shipments for the first seven months of 1925 exceeding by nearly two million pounds the quantity - then regarded as phenomenal - of 33,255,900 lbs., recorded for the same period of 1922.In yarns the business is extremely bad, and what orders there &quot;are, are often undertaken at prices far below replace-ment costs. In the main, hosiery yarns appear to be doing best.In piece goods the position goes from bad to worse and many manufaoturers are finding it impossible to keep their looms partially employed.     In the home trade what little demand there is appears to be for  woollen rather than worsteds.   Un-doubtedly the knitted outer garments are outting into the doth trade.     There are, however, signs of renewed interest in British goods on the pa,rt of Australian and Canadian buyers.Hosiery.     In the knit goods trade, reports from Nottingham show that there have been a fair number of Colonial purchases recently.     On the whole, this industry is in a better condition than moat others.     Prices appear to be stabilised.     The demand for knitted fabrics is remarkably good.     This trade Is one of the few bright spots amongst Textile Industries.Laos.     Business in the Lace trade Is very poor owing to the severe foreign competition and the inorease of overhead charges whioh have become out of all proportion.     To-day every raok costs 31d. in wages alone as compared with lid. in 1913.Linen.     Reports from Russia indicate that there should be a good crop and it ia anticipated that this will result in cheaper flax.     G-ood crops are also reported from Kenya Colony.In the yarn market business is quiet but not ao depressed as in some other trades.Jute.     Reports indicate that though jute has been steadier, there has not been a large number of transactions. Most firms making narrow width Hessians are finding business very limited and production will have to be curtailed unless there is an early revival.     On the other hand, ^demand for wide   j widths is better and prices remain steady.Drapery.     There is only a very limited demand from the retail&apos;end of the trade, the bright spot being knitted wear. There is a brisk trade in Christmas goods, particularly with South Africa and other Dominions, but there Is a lull in trade with the United States.Silk.     The silk trade ha3 been in such a parlous otate for so long that it is hardly necessary to say much about it. The situation remains as bad as ever, the export trade is poorj and the Home market is being completely flooded with cheap Prenoh goods as the recent fall in the value of the frano has considerably benefited the French.
Metal.Industries.     The pig iron and steel output in July showecTa&apos; further decline from the peak attained in May.     The production of pig iron amounted to 655,100 tons and of steel ingots and castings to 684,300 tons, respectively 57,800 and 143,400 tons less than in June.    Whereas the number of furnaces in blast at the end of June had shown a deorease of only one from the end of May, no less than sixteen additional furnaces went out of operation during July, leaving 206, active at the end of that month.In the exports the Bamo feature is noticeable, there being a falling off of 60,000 tons as compared with June.   This deoline was specially marked in the case of tinplates, a branch of the industry which was very active in the beginning of the year.One of the difficulties of which the steel manufacturers complain is that the railway companies&apos; flat rates which are particularly onerous to the iron and steel industry have not been reduced.The stagnation of the engineering and shipbuilding trade is bound to limit severely the demand for iron and steel.Hardware.     Business in the Birmingham area 1b quiet, and the export trade varies widely.&apos;    There seems to be a slight improvement in the Eastern markets, whereas reports from the Western markets are not so good.     Business with Ireland has been held back owing to the strike and the elections.   Thore is still a good amount of trade in wire and wire manufactures, but the amount of Overseas business has tended to decline of late.Engineering.   The trade as a whole is quiet, and the position is exceedingly patchy.     While in the main business is dull, there are in certain areas encouraging features, and in some sections an improvoment may be noticed over the last few months owing to constructional work being done in the vicinity. One of the bright Bpots is Lancashire where local railway engineers are experiencing almost a boom.    Wagon builders are still very busy, although there has been a falling off in demand owing to a weakness in the coal trade.     In the main it is felt that the principal   obstacle to trade ie the European situation whioh is preventing customers from placing now orders.Machine. Tool Trade.   In the machine tool trade conditions are becoming better, although the quantity of German maohine tools imported into Great Britain gives oause for anxiety. Export trade still remains fairly good..Gold Rolled Brass and Popper,   in the cold rolled brass and copper trade&apos; the situation is better, although business is fairly quiet.Silver and Hileotro-Plate.   The trade position is also very patohy.     Sheffield reports indicate a good market for forks and spoons.     Silverware as a whole is in poor demand.Opal.     The politioal situation during the past few months has beoome so involved that to a large extent it has disorganised tho coal trade.     There is still a shortage of coal in all the markets of the world, but owing to unstable exchanges and general depression in most countries, buyers have been unable to obtain tho sterling necessary to pay for the coal which they have already purohasedj   hence there has been a slacking
off in demand on the markets and even, in some oases, short time worked in the collieries, particularly in the North Eastern aroa.     There is a very subdued tone in the Welsh steam coal market.     New demand is limited.     Prance is holding off because of the high exchange rate, and the same is true of Belgium, Italy and - Germany.     The market, however, is preserved from a severe decline by large bookings on forward shipment account.     The exports of coal from the Welsh ports have shown a considerable decline, the largost purohaser by far being Prance.    Reports from other parts of the oountry indicate that the demand ia quiet.     Price3 remain firm, however, but there is a weakening in the tone of secondary grado fuel.     Business is fairly active for waste fuel.Chemicals.     Business in chemicals has beon very restricted during the past month, especially for the home trade.     Trade dopreasion, labour unroat, holidays and politics have all contributed to the quietness of the market.     The July export figures were tho worst for months past and showed a decrease of  645,511 in the value of chomioals and drugs exported.     Prices of the heavier chemioals have on the whole been well maintained.     One of the most depresaing parts of the trade is the super-phosphate Industry which goes from bad to worse.     Prices have dropped to a very low level in some casea below pre-war figures, and heavy losses are being incurred by the makers.     Foreign competition is very keen for the limited business available.     The Colonies have become self-supporting sinoe tho war in this commodity, and the market seems to be permanently lost.     The market for tar products remains very quiet, and the pharmaceutical and other fine chemioals havo been very dull and prices have shown a down-ward tendency.Potterjr.     The Pottory trado in the main is quiet, and the retaIi&quot;buBinees small.     So far retailers appear to be adopting a oautlous policy and buy from hand to mouth.   The present aggregate output is at a comparatively low level, and unemployment at Hanley at the last return exoeoded 19 per cent, compared with 25 por cent, at the worst period of the year and 10 per cent, at the bost.     There are, however, exceptions to tho general state of doprossion, and a number of the principal export houses, particularly some of thoso manufacturing high grade goods, and the makers of specialities are fairly busy.     On the other hand factories producing ordinary competitive lines and cheap grades are finding business very difficult.     In normal years two-thirds of the output of the potterios goes to the home market and one-third Overseas, although in reoent years there has been a tendency Tor the export trade to inorease at the expense of the home trade.     The present depression in the home
nomarket naturally affects the total output of the industry and explains the heavy rate of unemployment.     In the main it may be said that the export trade is distinctly better than the home trade.    V/ith the United States business i3 quite good and Canada is sending a fair amount of orders.    Australia sind New Zealand are taking more higher grade goods, but trade with South Africa is only moderate.     With the Argentine business is improving.Building Trade.     Business Is reported to be quiet, although in oertain areas a large amount of speculative building is being carried out.     In the main the position is improving.Paint and Varnish.    Trade has been adversely affected, not only by the pblitioal situation, but also by the boiler makers&apos; dispute in the North Eastern area.    Until this dispute is settled the shipbuilding and other industries are compelled to reduce their output and there is, there-fore, less demand for paint and varnish.    The house decorating trade has been depressed owing in a largo measure to laok of means on the part of house-owners and householders, partly due to the heavy taxation and partly to the unromuneratlve nature of their property under the Rent Restrictions Act.Shipping aM Shipbuilding..    The North Eastern area reports that thero Is very1 little change in the situation. The market is no better and in oertain directions tends to be worse.Boots and Shoes.     The boot and shoe trade has for a very long time been depressed but the position at the present time is slightly more hopeful.    Considerable anxiety is felt owing to tho home trade demand being con-centrated mainly on cheap footwear.     Medium grades are in stronger request but the old time demand for high grade qualities shows no sign of reviving.     There is, however, a sufficient demand for the highest class goods to keep fairly busy manufacturers who devote themselves to this kind of produot.     The latest report from Leicester indicates there has been a slight revival in the boot and shoe industry and also a revival in the Irish trade. Liverpool and Warrington reports indicate a more hopeful atmosphere.    Amerioa is ordering in small quantities but there is little business doing with the Continent,
ARTHUR BALE OUR.   (President Association of Chambers of Commerce).Orders for speoial steel and tool steel were small, though there were a fair number.   Better production was being obtained from labour.   A point which gave him some anxiety was that the difficulty which&apos; had been experienced two years ago in obtaining payment, was now recurring, though in a less acute form.The Japanese disaster had hit Sheffield hard.   The Insurance position was serious, since in contrast to what had happened in Chili - the insurance companies had a very severe earthquake clause in Japan, and these clauses had to be passed by Government serious loss and considerable difficulties were to be anticipated in this country in consequence.Amerioan manufacturers were engaged in a cut-throat competi-tion among themselves in spite of the tariff.     They could not compete with us in the world market, on account of their high costs of production:   these could, he thought, only be brought down by a long depression.   If and when world buying revived, we need not seriously fear competition from the United States.   It was true, however, that for reconstructional work in Japan, timber would be obtained from the United States, and their steel manufacturers would have the start of us in supplying steel girders, etc.In France there had been something approaching boycott of our goods, as a result of political feeling, but he hoped that this phase would soon pass away.   It seemed doubtful if France or Belgium would obtain large reparations as a result of the &quot;surrender&quot; in the Ruhr.J.W.MURRAY:   (Messrs. Ker Bolton &amp; Company, Glasgow, East India, Merchants).    Trade in the Far East..Most of the Far Eastern Markets are showing some signs of&apos; recovery but the financial situation, generally, is still far from satisfactory.    During the past two months there have been a great many failures among dealers, and this has been specially noticeable in Java where heavy losses had to be faced - by Banks (mostly Native and Dutch) owing to Sugar speculators being unable to meet their engagements?     This kind of liquidation is still going on and, naturally, means a feeling of insecurity generally.    The Textile Markets are quite healthy - stocks being very moderate, but owing to the scarcity of money the buying is, mostly, from hand to mouth?   It is thought that the worst is over, and - judging from my own experience - this would appear to be the case.   I find more enquiry coming by cable, but it is only possible to put through very moderate quantities as the markets are not at all responsive to the higher costs of Cotton Textiles on this side.   My opinion is we shall see a steady business being done during the next few months but, until the financial position is more secure, the volume will, I fear be moderate.In all kinds of Hardware-Galvanised Iron, etc. there is quite a healthy demand and stocks In Far Eastern Markets are small.So far I have no information as to what effect the recent disaster in Japan is likely to have on Japanese Competition in these markets   but   my view is.that for a time at any rate there must, of necessity, be less severe competition from Japanese sources.
jKr. H.A.F. LIKES^ for the India Office),In July the first real break in Indian trade had taken place.   During the previous 8 months the figures of imports and exports had stood pr^otioally steady, exports being to the value of about  20,000,000 and imports  13,000,000.   The figures for July, however, were  17,000,000 exports and  11,000,000 Imports.   Amongst the imports, iron and steel and machinery showed the most serious decline.   Cotton pieoe-gooda had also fallen off, but it was a hopeful sign that the imports of white and dyed goods were reviving, while there was a Blight falling off in the demand for grey goods.   The importation of bullion alBO showed signs of returning to normal, gold imports had shown a marked decline, while silver imports remained at a steady normal figure, approximately  1,000,000 worth per month. A seasonal falling off in India&apos;s export trade was to be expected during July, August and September,   The wheat market of whloh he had given a somewhat gloomy aooount at the last meeting, had recovered! forward quotations were now below spot quotations.Mr. JOHN SANDERSON (Sandereon Murray &amp; Elder, Ltd., Australasian Meronanta)&apos;.By this time of the year the main products of Australia had been marketed.   The drought was at an end, and there had been satisfactory rains.    Wheat prospeots were good, and Indeed a record crop was expected in South Australia, but it waB still somewhat too early to prophesy definitely. Wool was fetohing a good prioe.   Some falling off in demand was to be expected as a result of the Japanese disaster, but so far this had not been felt to a marked degree.   Internal trade was quiet, as was usual at thiB time of year.   The meat Industry, especially in Queensland, was Buffering from high oost of production.    The position and proepeote of Australian trade in general were good.SIR E. STO0KTON,M.P. (Messrs. Abbot &amp; Stookton, cloth Merchants Manchester: President of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce).With regard to the Lancashire Textile Trade there eeeme to have been very little change in the position.    The main difference is that we have had a considerable rise in the urios of raw material which has in some degree aooentuated bur difficulties.   In certain directions the advance in price may have stimulated certain buyers to operate in those cases where they have been standing on one side uncertain as t* the trend of values.Future months&apos; prioeB for raw material are still at a considerable discount, and while these conditions exist we cannot hope to have any real sustained period of buying. While I do not oonslder there has been very much change In the whole position during the last two months, I am of opinion that things have gone no worse but possibly slightly better on the whole.The big advance has appreciated the values of stooks and in many cases given a better chance of their being cleared. The big markets for Lancashire goods remain bare of supplies, and if a state of oonfidenoe oan be brought about in the stability -of values, I am sure we Bhall have a considerable improvement in the staple industryt
MR. TOM SHAW, M.P. (Secretary of the International Congress of &quot;Textile Workers;.The outlook in tho manufacturing side of the cotton textile industry was very gloomy.   The home trade, it was true, was not bad, but general dieoouragement was making itBelf felt, he feared, in the iiHustry.   Our export trade was labouring under great difficulties.   In pre-war days it used to be said that 80$ of our production was for export, and that 80$ of this went to the East.   Lately there had been a greater amount of enquiries from India, but these did not materialise in the shape of orders. Apart from political considerations, ho thought that &apos;two great obstacles stood in the way of the export trade,1 viz. (1) the high price of the raw material and&apos;(2) the high cost of dyeing and finishing.   To regain our Lancashire trade he considered that reductions in both these items were necessary, and also facilities for immediate access to new inventions in the dyeing and finishing processes, Reports from operatives, employers and shippers were unanimous as to the bad state of the industry, and he .) feared ho oould not agree with the suggestion of Sir Edwin Stookton that prospects looked better for the future.MR. F. HOLROYD (Director of R, &amp; J, Holroyd, Limited, Halifax; Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association), was inclined rather to take Mr, Shaw&apos;s view of the cotton trade than that expressed by Sir Edwin Stookton.   The only redeeming -feature was that the great advance in the price of the raw material would enable stocks to be realised nearer to oost price.   The outlook was very gloomy.   He had said at the last meeting that he thought there were better prospects for forward ootton supplies, but the hot weather which had been experienced in August in the United States had put an -end to the hope that this year&apos;s orop would be better than last year&apos;s.   The two expert investigators who had been sent out by the Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation now confirmed the United States Government reports on the ootton crop, and it was evident that there would be another year of shortage of the raw material.   It was to be hoped that this would spur on the Empire Cotton Growing Association in their efforts to make us independent of the United States for our supplies of raw cotton.   Until this was attained, there could be no feeling of security.     It was perhap% true that if the eastern markets, which were now practically bare of stocks, appreciated the conditions obtaining in America, they might come forward to buy.   But it seemed likely that there would be only a sufficient supply of the raw material to keep mills in this country going for about three-quarters of the year.Mr. Lindsay said that there might be a fair surplus of cotton available in India during the coming season:   India had always had to fight for markets for her ootton.Mr, Holroyd replied that the Indian production was only BUitable for the coarser kinds of cloth; but it was possible that a big surplus of Indian cotton might meet the demands of Scandinavian and other manufacturers who produce mainly rough cloths, and thereby leave more of the American crop for the British industry.
With regard to the application on behalf of the cotton and lace industries for assistance to their trade in the shape of an import duty, he observed that very considerable quantities of cotton yarn were now being brought to this oountry from Belgium and Prance, and cotton spinners would, he thought, regard it as inequitable that the manufacturing group should be protected, while they themselves, who supply material to the manufacturing group, do not get similar protection.   He mentioned that in the case of a reoent order for .25,000 lbs. of cotton yarn, the lowest price whioh British spinners oould quote was under-out to the extent of 2d. per lb. by Italy, and that yarn for lace making had been sold in Nottingham by a Belgian firm at 2^-d. per lb, less than the British spinners oould sell it at.LIEUT.-COLONEL THE HON. F,V. WILLEY (Francis Willey and Company, Bradford).Wool Textiles.Employment in the Combing, Spinning and Weaving is particularly bad, and shows no signs of improvement. I should estimate that machinery is certainly not running 30$ of capacity, perhaps less than that.   Spinning maohinery also is largely on short time; and, taking the trade as a whole, probably not running 60$ of capacity.The real difficulty, of course, is under-employmentj the Unemployment Returns do not show this, but the sub-normal earnings of the workers in the Industry must, Of course, substantially affect general home trade. The raw material end of the trade has been assisted by active purchases of wool, noils and tops from all parts of Europe, though the current demand for Germany has fallen off a good deal.   colonial shipments are keeping up, but these are on old contracts, and new business is alarmingly small.With regard to the application for consideration under the Safeguarding of Industries Act, having,as you know, voted against Part 2 in the House, I am not in sympathy with the present application,   In a trade where we export 60$ of what we produce, I cannot see how Proteotion for 40$ would benefit the industry in the main.
MR. SUTOLIFFS SMITH   (Bradford Dyers&apos; Association) referring to&apos;Mr. Shaw&apos;s remarks in regard to access to new dyes, said his experience was that the licensing arrangements secured this satisfactorily. He agreed that Frenoh dyeing had in various cases been found unsatisfactory.   He had himself told the French that if they took our dyeing and finish-ing from us, British dyers and finishers would refuse to do work for them.   He agreed that the costs of these prqoesses were high, but a majority of customers said &quot;that even if they were reduced by 50$, it would not help them.   In Bradford only about 50$ of looms were running.The prices both of raw ootton and raw wool were too high, while in China uncertainty and instability and the risks of sending goods up country continued to militate against our trade.   Prices for wool combing in Franoe and Germany were less than those ruling here.   In this reepeot the French, although they had less machinery, had the advantage in that they work 24 hours per day, as againet 8 hours worked in Bradford.   The Frenoh were getting more orders than they could doal with, and their conversion costs were less.   They could afford to pay 6d. per lb. more for wool and yet under-cut us.With regard to the resolution passed by the Bradford Chamber of Commerce in favour of the applica-tlon of the Safeguarding of Industries Act to the wool trade, he wished to point out that this was at a small meeting of the Chamber and the rosolution was only carried by 9 votes to 6, the total membership being 1,200.   The &quot;Yorkshire Evening Argus&quot; was, however, taking a referendum of the trade&apos; on the following questions:-&quot;(l) Are you in favour, whero the Empire holds a monopoly, of placing an export tax on such raw-products as are exported to countries-outside the Empire?(2) Are you in favour of application being made to the Board of Trade for the appointment of a Committee, as provided for in the Safeguarding of Industries Act (Part II), to enquire into the oause of unemployment in the Bradford woollen and worsted trade?&quot; %The state of the voting, as known so far, was as follows:-(l) For an export tax...........     198(2) In favour of an enquiry under the safeguarding the town, it appeared, was divided into two camps over this question, and the labour interests were, he thought, aggrieved at not having been consulted.   The textile workers were to hold a mass meeting on the question on Saturday, and Mr. Sutohffe Smith promised to acquaint the &quot;Board with the result.Against216of Industries Act Against .S45 91
The President suggested that perhaps opinion was divided as between the dress material manufacturers and other branohee.   He understood that it was in dress materials that Pronoh competition was principally being felt,Mr. Sutcliffe Smith agreed.   The importation of French goods, had, however, not yot reached pre-war figures, and any appreciation of the franc would. reduce their advantage!   French manufacturers them-selves thought that the present phase was only temporary.   Thore was, nevertheless, room for a reduction In ooot3 in the homo industry, and for reduotion in retail prioos - and also, he would add, room for a reduction in taxation.   Traders were experiencing difficulty in paying taxes; in some oases he had heard that they would have to do so out of capital.   He thought that this country had been too heroio in the meaoures it had taken for paying off its debt.   The French had the advantage in that they were not paying their debt nor the interest on it, nor taxing themselves seriously.The present depression in the piece-goods trade was probably to some extent the result of the vogue for knitted goods.   He fearod that the Bradford application - if one was actually made - would raise the whole issue of free trade versus protection, and that in that case all trades which were hit by depreciation of foreign currencies would similarly apply.He enquired if steps had been taken to make Export Credits available for reconstruction in Japan.The President replied that facilities would be made available not only in the shape of Export Credits, but also under the Trade Facilities Act and steps had been taken through diplomatic channels to bring to the notioe of the Japanese that firms of satisfactory standing could get the benefit of these Aots,Mr. Sutoliffo Smith wished to point out that the deputation which had recently been received from Bradford represented only the manufacturing section. If the French were prevented from selling here, they would seek other markets abroad and compete with us there.   The President remarked, however, that even at present the British trade was apparently not getting its export markets.   Mr. Sutoliffo Smith said that at present the French were under-Belling us by about l/-per yard, but he thought thore would be difficulty in showing to what extent thiB resulted from the depredation of their currency.-si-
Itr ROBERT GLAHFIELD   (Chairman of George Glanfield and Sons &quot;--   Limited, Wholesale Clothing Manufaoturers)   explained that he was obtaining monthly reports through hia Federation (Wholesale-Clothing. Manufaoturers1 Federation) from /the various areas in the country.   The replies reoeived this month he summarised as follows :-&quot;Since the Report made on July 2nd, trade has been generally moderate, and in most oases the amount of business done for the year, as compared with last year, is about the same or rather less.As compared with pre-war the bulk is less; the turnover is more by, I should say, 50 to TO per oent according to quality of output by individual firms.The Summer season did not turn out as well as was anticipated, owing to the weather, whilst the Winter season now opening will depend very much on the weather, but speaking generally the Winter orders are not as good as they should be. In oertain industrial areas, however, especially amongst the colliers, trade has been better.   The retailers are holding off and are buying from hand to mouth:   the stocks held by them generally throughout the country are not large.Labour is sufficient for the present needs, but with any spurt in trade there would not be enough trained workers.Shipping trade is moderate, but some firms who especially study this market say there is an improvement.   Lower-priced goods are asked for more than ever, and the demand for a really good article seems to be lessening each season.&quot;MR..MURRAY   (Iron and.Steel Trade in the West of Scotland, 20thSeptember).The Iron and Stool Trade in the West of Scotland is wery depressed.The Blast Furnaces are stocking pig iron very heavily and there is little sale although prices are said to be much below oost.There is a strong probability that if matters continue as they are several furnaces will be blown-out or damped down very soon.Furnaces in blast 10th August 1923    -   46 &quot;       &quot;      &quot;    14th September 1923   -   44.The Steel Trade&quot;is very short of orders.The placing of the P. &amp; 0, Steamers has resulted in some orders being placed with one Company but generally speaking there is very little doing.Two Steel Works are entirely shut down and others are working short, and it is reported that one Company a*presently working is considering the question of closing down.The immediate effect of a settlement of the Ruhr difficulties will probaHyHDe bad for the Iron and Steel Trade,There Is reported to be about 800,000 tons of finished material in stock in the Ruhr and this would require to be marketed- and the works when starting up will push for new business and probably take low prices to obtain such business.jftsnmne
1o mr. PUSH (General Secretary to the Iron and Steel TradeB T^^&quot;&quot; &apos; Federation).The reports from our Divisional areas during th* past couple of months, have shown a continuous increase in the amount of unemployment and short time working in the manufacturing branches of the iron and steel industry. This is consistent with the reduced production of pig iron and steel ingots and castings during July and August as compared with June last, which is shown in the follow-ing statistical returnsj-June July Aug; Tone.

The number of Blastfurnaces in operation at the end of August was 196 out of a possible 487.   An additional furnace has been put on at Ulverstone, but as against this, two are being damped down at Barrow-in-Furness at which establishment the men In the Steel Plant have been put on a day to day notice,Messrs. Dorman, Long and Company are damping down one or two furnaces at their Redcar Works.Of the Finishing branches of the industry which are the most satisfactory, are the Steel Sheet and Galvanising Trade where there appears to be a good demand, (more particularly for thin gauges) and the Tinplate trade.Establishments catering more especially for Ship-building and Engineering are in a very unsatisfactory position.   There are no signs of recovery in the Malleable Iron Trade.Regarding future prospeots, there appear to be some anticipations of Improvement during the next month or so, but the grounds for thlB are diffioult to gauge.   In some branches of the industry, however, manufacturers are looking for inoreased orders from Japan for reconstruction purposes following thf recent disaster.
COLONEL SIR CHARLES WRIGHT (Director of Baldwins&apos; Ltd.)TINPLATE AMD BLAOKPLATE.    During the early part of this month there has been greater activity in this Trade and a substantial volume of business has passed. There is every evidence of a steady demand for three or four months ahead,BLACK AMD GALVANISED SHEET.     This Trade has also revived, somewhat during the last few weeks and judging from present indications, prospeots for the next few months are favourable,HEAVY STEEL.   This Industry continues in a very depressed Btate, the demand for Rails, Sections, etc., having further deolined and business is at a very low ebb.   In view of the restricted requirements in the World&apos;a markets, the growth of Continental competition is more and more seriously felt and the immediate out-look is far from promising.1R, A,W, TAIT (Chairman of British Aluminium Co, Ltd., and Direotor of British Metal Corporation, Ltd.),The situation in the Non-Ferrous Metal Trade remained much as it waB two months ago.   The export trade was disorganised, but the home trade was reasonably good.   The Aluminium Sheet Trade in India had previously suffered from price cutting on the part of the Germans, who were now no longer able to oompete, but the Frenoh were now coming into that market at prices very similar to those formerly quoted by the Germans.   This was a new competition, the Frenoh having hitherto taken practically no part in this trade: their competition was not yet large in extent, but was rapidly Increasing.   The prices they offered were about 2d. a lb., (say 15$) below ours, and he was satisfied that at that price they oould show a better profit than we could at 2d. per lb. more.   They had the advantage of paying for their raw material and their labour in francs, while receiving payment In sterlingCOLONEL 0.0. ARMSTRONG (Past President of the Council of the Federation of British Industries, Chairman of Greenwood &amp; Batley, Ltd.).General engineering showed no Improvement.   At home no orders were being placed for fresh plant, for the reason that existing plant was already standing idle, while the foreigner would noi buy on aocount of fluctuating exchangee and disturbed political conditions.   Two or three cases had come to his knowledge where the Frenoh had secured foreign orders for plant in certain particular trades In competition with us; these were new lines in which to encounter French competition.   Indeed In one instanoe the French had actually tendered at a lower price for an English order than home firms could do.
Mr. HUGO HIRST. (Chairman of the General Eleotrio Company),Business in domestic electrical goods was keeping up well, and was better than last year, though it was impossible to book orders ahead.   The only reason he could suggest for the prosperity of this particular branch of the industry was that aotivity in building was apparently on the increase.  -On the other hand, in the ho avy engineering branoh the pooition was different, and induntrial business was practically at a standstill.   Many electrioal firms, it wae true, were fairly busy as a result of various schemes for railways and municipal undertakings which had been held up for a time but were now maturing.   This was keeping the heavy engineering works fairly full for the moment.    It was, however, only a home demand: the export trade was bad, and London Shippers&apos; export business in heavy eleotrioal goods waa at a standstill. In South Africa, Australia, the Argentine and China the position oontinued as it had been g months ago, though there had been a slight betterment in India,   There was an exception to this inactivity, however, in the case of telephone apparatus, for which there was a large demand from all over the world. Hie own firm were employing 1,000 more hands on this work than they did IS months ago.   BusineaB in wireless apparatus was at a standstill pending a Government deolsion in regard to broad-caetlng.    He thought there would be a revival however when this decision was reached, and expressed the hope that it might be expedited.With regard to ftr. Baring&apos;s view that a settlement of the Ruhr would lead to an improvement in business, Mr, Hirst said that the electrical trade wae already feeling competition from European oountrieB, and one was always prone to suspect that Germany was at the back of this.   Some oases had even come to hie knowledge in which oertaln engineering firmB who had obtained. Government credits had utilised their own money to plaoe orders abroad.   He was apprehensive as to what would happen when the stooks which had accumulated in the Ruhr were released and flooded our markets.   Though he adhered to the view which he had expressed at the previous meeting that a settlement of the Ruhr question was highly neceseary, he considered that there should bo some regulation with regard to the release of these stocks.Mr, Baring remarked that presumably the proceeds of the sale of these etooka would enable Germany to purchase from the Argentine and other countries and so inorease the power of thOf3e countries to purohase British eleotrioal goods, among other things.    Mr. Hirst replied that this tendenoy might take Bome years to make itself felt.   Mr. Baring said he was hopeful that it would not take bo long, and that the flood of accumulated stocks would soon be absorbed.    In reply to a question by the President, Mr. Hirst sald*that he expeoted the Btooks released would Include a large amount of eleotrioal material, and Indeed of every kind of goods.
slg^FREDgRIOK LEWIS. (Chairman of Fumes s, Withy and Company), -*^h4&apos;d&quot; nothing much which was fresh or satisfactory to report of tho Shipping industry.   There had,a few days ago been k demand from&apos;Montreal: for freights for grain, but this had not beon reflected in the rates from othor centres.   The Japanese disaster hdd caused a momentary demand for tbnnage, but this had now fallen off.   It was difficult to work vossels: one of his firm&apos;s ships had recontly taken 10 days to load a cargo of 1,000 tons of coal at Hull, owing presumably to congestion at the docks,   Conditions in South Wales-wore he thought, similar, and steamers had, a month or two since, taken 10 days in loading where they should normally have taken only two days.   The export of coal was not quito as large as It had beonj but was still big. - Tho general Ou-tlook was not satisfactory.MR. ARTHUR WATSON (Gonoral Manager, London, Midland and Scottish &quot;&quot;&quot;Railway&apos; Company).The tonnage carried by tho railways was better than last month,.and appreciably better than last year, so far as concerned the three prinolpal classes of articles carried by the railways, viz.&quot;general merchandise, coal and coke, and rough materials suqh as roadstdne. The way in which the figures of tonnage carried kopt up was indeed surprising,- though this was net accurately reflected in railway receipts, which had beon affected by reductions of ratoe.     In Lancashire, however, which Was one of the most important railway traffic areas served by the London Midland and Scottish Group, trade was almost dead,: sb far ad railway carryings were ooncerned, though he could not answor for road transport.MR. EVAH WILLIAMS. (President, Mining Association of Great Britain).&apos;The coal trade was on the whole weaker since last month; the falling off in the German demand had affeoted the trade on the East Coast and In Durham and Scotland,   There had beon a fall in export prices some 15$ to E0$ from the highest point reached in May.   The French demand continued much tho samo, though rather lees than It had boon in May,   Tho volume of exports was surprisingly goodj stocks were low in-France and Italy.   During the last fortnight there had been perhaps a greater disinclination to buy on the part of the French, on account of their hopes of a sottlemcnt being reached In the Ruhr:   the output of tho Frenoh eollierios was alBo inoroasing.   When the Ruhr quostion was settled, a falling off in oxporte to France and Germany would no doubt result. *South American markets remained fairly good, though high pricos had let in unitod States competition to a small extent there, as also in Europe, but ho thought we should be able to maintain our hold on the South Amerioan trade.The home trade was not activej many blast furnaoos had been dampod down, and the industrial demand had been declining for the last two months: the demand   for household coal was slightly better.   He thought that the congestion at South Wales ports to whioh Sir Frederick Lewis had reforred, though it might have existed some months back, had now been oloarod.   Three shifts of tippers and trimmers were now being worked there.
SIR CHARLES WRIGHT.ggajb   Market conditions still oontlnuo unsettled and no Immediate or permanent Improvement can be looked for excepting that with the advent of Winter the House Coal trade will naturally be more brisk.     At this time of the year it is usual for large consumers abroad to contract in respect of the ensuing year, but 00 far there is very little enquiry for delivery 1924, due apparently to the polioy pursued by buyers of waiting further the course of prices.SIR ItEROY DEM SHAM (Chairman of the Dnlted Tanners&apos; Federation).The leather trade had boen bad f%m the middle of May to the end of July in consequence of disorganisation of the price of the raw material in South Amerioa and the United States, a drop of some 35$ to 35$ having suddenly taken place.   In August, however, there was a slight upward trend of the prioe of raw leather and this seemed to have a steadying effects an improvement took place in August, and in september there had beon a rather greater improvement than the seasc;:. alone would warrant in the demand for leathor for boots and shoes. Production was now about 10$ less than at the beginning oftixe year, but at the end of the yoar it should be baok to the level at which it stood last year.   It should be borne in mind that this production was 15$ above the pre-war level, although some 25$ below the peak of the war period.   Tho trade In boots and shoes for export was increasing.   Prospects in the trade were on the whole better than for some time past and prioee were on a lower basis.   Good business oould ho thought, be done with France if tho exchanges could be stabilised.   Export business represented hardly 15$ of the trade, the bulk of which was for home consumption.SIR WILLIAM PEAROE (Association of British Cheraloal Manufacturers).-   The chemical trade continued fairly satisfactory.   It had not passed through a porlod of aoute depression, like so many other industries.   The heavy branoh of the industry was rather better than tho fino branohj the export of heavy ohemicals was good, especially of soda and caustic soda.   The national consumption of sulphuric acid, however, which was ofton taken as an index of general trade conditions, was still only some 70$ in volume of the pre-war consumption. The fine chomioal trade was still looking to the situation in Franoe and Germany with some anxiety.   The large Btooks which had been seized by the French in the Runr had not yet been put on the world market, the small quantities which had hitherto been sold, had been marketed at world prioes, and had, therefore, not affeoted the position.   At present, China and India were taking a considerable portion of the output of British dyes, but it was uncertain how this would be affocted when it once more became possible for Gormany to export her dyes.   At present the export of German dyes end chemicals was being Impeded through the difficulty awa of using the Rhine for transport.   When this obstacle was removed he was afraid that the British works, whloh were to a certain extent new by comparison, would again find difficulty in getting export trade in the faoo of German competition.
