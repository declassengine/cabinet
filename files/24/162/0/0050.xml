H Q r\TThiS Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]     * O 0\   Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1923.T^dl______-^P./CONTRIBUTION BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT FOR EARTHQUAKE RELIEF IN JAPAN.&apos;THE recent earthquake in Japan has been a disaster of the first magnitude, and is comparable to the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 and to the Great Fire of London. The loss of life has been at least 100,000, and damage to property is estimated at about  200,000,000. Two-thirds of Tokyo, the Japanese capital, have been devastated, the great port of Yokohama entirely destroyed, and the naval base of Yokosuka seriously damaged.   It will take many years to make good the loss.The sympathy of the whole world has been extended to Japan; relief funds have been raised in many countries; and gifts in money or in kind have been sent by several Governments. On the first news of the disaster, His Majesty&apos;s Government instructed the Commander-in-Chief, China Squadron, to purchase locally  10,000 worth of foodstuffs and supplies, which he was to place at the disposal of the Japanese authorities. For private sympathisers, a Mansion House Fund was opened, which has now reached  250,000.The United States Government took similar measures to His Majesty&apos;s Government in rushing supplies to Japan; but their Navy Department expended no less than 650,000 dollars (as compared with our  10,000) in purchasing such supplies in China and elsewhere. In addition, the War Department also made considerable purchases. As Congress was not sitting, no legislative authority could be obtained for a cash payment by the United States Government for earthquake relief; otherwise, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Charged&apos;Affaires at Washington, it is not improbable that a special grant would have been voted. As it was, the President himself issued a call to the nation to subscribe 5,000,000 dollars through the Red Cross organisation, and this large sum. was raised in less than a fortnight. His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Tokyo has recently written: &quot;The United States &quot; Government have been extraordinarily generous in the help, financial and otherwise, &quot;-which they have given to Japan. Their destroyers have been present in Yokohama &quot; in very large numbers, no less than ten having arrived within two days.&quot;Not only have the United States subscribed most generously to earthquake relief; but their generosity has been very widely advertised. Although, in present circumstances, we can hardly be expected&apos; to compete with America, yet it is inevitable that among Japanese the sympathy lavished upon them by a nation which is often regarded as an antagonist will be contrasted with the more modest efforts of their ally of twenty years&apos; standing. A reflection of this attitude has already been noticed in responsible Japanese quarters in London. It is considered most important that at this moment, when the Anglo-Japanese Alliance has been recently ended, we should seize the opportunity of showing that we still regard the Japanese as our friends and that we value their friendship.Sir C. Eliot, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo, has been concerned at the apparent discrepancy between American expressions of sympathy and our own. On the 13th September, in the course of his journey to Japan, he cabled :-&quot;I see in newspapers continual references to assistance offered to Japan ;&apos;(by United States, but none to similar British action.  I hope that omission is only apparent.  Japanese are extremely sensitive and will not forget friendly ([ action.  On the other hand, there will be no lack of mischief-makers trying &apos; to show that Japan&apos;s old ally is not doing much for her.&quot;Various suggestions were in consequence proposed with a view to the display ot the sympathy of this country in a striking and suitable manner among others, a gift in money or kind from His Majesty&apos;s Government for earthquake relief, t onsulted on this question, His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Tokyo replied :-I think that direct contribution from His Majesty&apos;s Government would oe appreciated by Japanese Government. Offer of money would in no way 1815   [10852]
II offend their susceptibilities, but if His Majesty&apos;s Government prefer to esubstantial relief in kind, following articles are&apos; urgently;required in \tT ^quantities: enamelled ware for cooking,: Wool clothing, underwear blankef &quot;and shawls, cotton material and cotton, flannel, shoes, buckets umWiio,. &quot;clothing should be durable and of small size.&quot; &apos;    &apos; as;The Treasury were thereupon applied to for a grant of  100,000-for th provision of relief in kind and to be spent in this country. The sum was estimated ^ view of the grants already made by certain Dominion Governments and bv the Governments of Crown Colonies in the Far East, viz :-Australian Government           ... ... 60,000New Zealand Government        ... ... 25,000Hong Kong Government          ... ... 30,000Straits Settlements Government... ... 6,000Copies of the correspondence are attached from which it will be seen that the Treasury did not feel able to sanction the grant. But the necessity of impressing the Japanese with our sympathy in a striking way is considered to be of such importance, that it has been decided to submit the question to the Cabinet for their favourable consideration. Two months have now elapsed since the earthquake, but the need for relief of the inhabitants of the devastated area is still urgent. During these two months, Parliament has not been sitting; so it has had no opportunity to express its regret at the disaster. It would not be too late, therefore, for it to take the first opportunity which will occur during the coming session, to place on record its sympathy with the Government and people of Japan, and at the same time to vote  100,000 for the relief of the sufferers. Unless there is a risk of the proposal being subjected to unsympathetic criticism in any responsible quarter in the House this would certainly be the most impressive manner of making the gift. The impression left on the Japanese mind may be all the more enduring for being made rather late in the day.&quot; Although we learn from Tokyo that money would be much preferred to gifts in kind, owing to difficulties of distribution, &amp;o, there is of course little doubt that the money, if voted, would be expended in this country. But it is considered that to make such a stipulation publicly would deprive this act of generosity of some of its effect.Foreign Office, November 9, 1923.Annex I.TF 2844/2650/23]&apos; - Foreign. Office to. Treasury.Sir, &apos; Foreign Office, October 9,1923.I AM directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit, for submission to the Lords, Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, paraphrases of telegrams on the subject of the assistance which should be rendered by His Majesty s Government to Japan as a practical expression of sympathy with the Japanese people in regard to the disaster which has devastated the Tokyo area.2. Their Lordships will observe that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo, now returning to his post, is concerned at the apparent discrepancy between American expressions of sympathy and our own. The Secretary of State shares Sir C. Eliot s anxiety; and considers it most important, at this moment, when the Anglo-Japanese Alliance has been recently ended, that we should seize the opportunity of showing that we still regard the Japanese as our friends and value their friendship.3. Various projects have been considered, among which was one for a direct loan from Government to Government. This was rejected, since it was understood that the proposal was not viewed with favour by their Lordships. A gift from His Majesty&apos;s Government was then suggested; and the suggestion was submitted to nis Ma&apos;jesty&apos;s Charge dAffaires at Tokyo for his observations in Foreign Office telegram No. 90 of the 17th September.. Mr. Palairet replied in his telegram No. 154 ol tne 25th September that such a gift would be appreciated by the Japanese Government, whether offered in the form of money or goods.
i So far, all that His Majesty^ Government have done for the alleviation of I sufferinff in Japan has been the gift of  10,000 worth of foodstuffs and supplies, which the Commander-in-Chief, China Squadron, was authorised to convey, to j Yokohama, as recorded in Foreign Office letter of the 24th September last. The j fjnited States Government took similar measures in rushing supplies^ from the I Philippines; but in addition to this the President issued a call to the United States I to subscribe&apos; 5,000,000 dollars through the Red Cross organisation, and this large ! sum was raised, in less than a fortnight. Further, American business houses are j stated to have come out with definite declarations of sympathy with Japan. Thus, I the United States Steel Corporation would appear to have announced that they would lo-ive orders for Japan priority over all other orders,, and that they would make no advance in their prices, notwithstanding any increase of business which might result Ifrom the demand caused by the Japanese disaster; and the Bethlehem Steel I Corporation is alleged to have made a somewhat similar announcement..5. Outside the United Kingdom, the British Empire have raised funds for Japan, which challenge comparison with the efforts made in this country. The Canadian Government have shipped foodstuffs and supplies, and the Governor-General has opened a Relief Fund, for which MontreaPs quota alone is assessed at 1 100,000 dollars.  The Australian Government have voted  60,000 in addition to the  60,000 raised by public subscription, and a ship laden with foodstuffs, clothing and I stores, valued at  120,000, has already left Melbourne for Japan.  The Hong Kong I Government have voted 250,000 dollars (local currency).I 6. Public subscriptions in the United Kingdom have raised a sum of almost I  230,000 for the Mansion House Fund. This sum can scarcely be regarded as impressive beside the 5,000,000 dollars raised in the United States, but in present I circumstances we can hardly be expected to compete with America in generosity.. It I does seem, however, essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not lag behind I the Government of British Dominions and Colonies; and it is especially in view of the I official grants by the Governments of Australia and Hong Kong mentioned in the I preceding paragraph that the Secretary of State requests that their Lordships will I consent to a grant of  100,000 for the provision of relief in kind and to be spent in I this country as a mark of the sympathy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the I Government and people of Japan in the terrible calamity which has befallen them.I am, &amp;c.V. WELLESLEY.Annex II.Treasury to Foreign Office. (Received October 24.)Treasury Chambers, October 24, 1923. I     IN rePly t0 Mr; Wellesley&apos;s letter of the 9th instant, I am directed by the Lords I Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to express their regret that they do not feel able to sanction Lord Curzon&apos;s proposal that a gift of  100,000 should be made to the Japanese Government as a mark of the sympathy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the calamity which has befallen them.I am, &amp;c.G. L. BARSTOW.
