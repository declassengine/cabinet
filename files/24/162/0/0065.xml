4 SijEHB COMMON ISTSA correspondent who is in close touch with theExecutive has sent the following account of the party&apos;financial difficulties:&quot;At the request of the Comintern the Communist Party of Great Britain had sent a detailed report on their finances which stated that the Perty required at least  200 a week, an attempt had been made to reduce this sum to  165 with &quot;disastrous&quot; resulta.&quot;Subsequently, however, the expenditure has been reduced to  100 a week, and more recently to  56,a weak.   Moscow has been appealed to for assistance.&quot;Mosoow has refused all assistance till the January allowance is due, and also reminds the Communist Party of Great Britain that they have still to account for a sum of  54,000.u   &quot;A private meeting to discuss the above serious State of affairs was held on Saturday, October 27th. Four of the provincial organisers had already had their allowances stopped, and all had had their pay cut.   How Tom Boll, Harry Pollitt, Minnie Birch and Lena Gurran are not to.be paid after Saturday, November 3rd,   They have been promised their expenses (if possible) and are expected to continue their work,   the pay of all others is to be reduced by  1 -  2 a week.   She fact that He Hie lansbury is still to be paid displeases Misses Birch and Curran,, since it eeeras that they are dependent on&apos;their pay and do not consider that she is.   . In faot, there is an uncomfortable feeling of tension at Headquarters, and the district organisers are actively discontent.&quot;Jack Murphy and Tom Mann are paid direct from Berlin*&quot;Another correspondent reported on&apos;November 10ththat;&quot;The paid office staff at headquarters has been dismissed - Miss lansbury and Inirpin only remain.    Watts and his daughter are paid from shop profits.     Uutt is still to be paid but Bell returns to Scotland (via Manchester) this week-end and draws no further salary.,   Cant at lambs Conduit Street is under a fortnight&apos;3 notice.&quot;Helen Crawford, Bell and Jackson have this week expressed the opinion that the lack of funds is only temporary and Boll states that inkpin hasbeen/
-  ii -been instructed to make urgent representation to Moscow for an immediate subsidy.   &apos;j?he conference, at present arranged for the second week in January, is likely to be postponed owing to lack of funds.   The McManus party on the Executive, openly accuse Ruth Morgan of adverse reports to Moscow (particularly on Women&apos;s Movement and Young Communist League).     McManus states privately that it is an attempt to discredit him.     Gallaoher is bitterly opposed to McManus and is very friendly with Palme Dtrtt and Ruth Kurgan.   Jackson has reported to the B.C. that Party Training is undeveloped and in a very backward state.   &apos;jjo remedy this it is suggested by the E.C that Jackson tours the country, visits every branch, advises, instructs and gives a practical demonstration of the lines to be followed by those giving instruction and suggesting candidates for instructions     Each branch visited will bear the expanse of Jaolcson&apos;s visit and Jackson will.be found a job pending improved financial conditions...&quot;It has been deoided to withdraw Jackson, MoManus and Collyer as Parliamentary candidates.    400 has been raised by local subscription to the Gefides Election Fund at Oreenook.&quot;It appears that at the beginning of October Inkpin attempted to raise a mortgage of  2,500 on the Zing Street premises but, in view of the present difficulties, this transaction was evidently not completed.The London Distriot Party Committee is endeavouring to extract a weekly lev;? from its members in order to raise funds for the payment of the organiser for. the next three months.The Communist Party is trying to raise a fund of at least  175 for the defence of Braddock and Power in connection with the Liverpool Post Office hold-up.On Hovember 10th an &quot;all-in comraunist conference&quot;held at the South Place Institute, E.C.:     some 300oelegates attended representing 195 trade union branches and? Trades Councils:   A. McLIanus was in the chair.   Thefollowing resolutions were passed and a committee of 12elected as outlined in paragraph No. 5 below:&quot;1.     This Conference of Delegates from Trade Unions, Co-operative Organisations end working Class Political bodies places on record its opinion that the fight of the German workers againstHugo /
Hugo Stinnes end Poincare is a common fight in which the British, French and German Workers should join hands.   It sends the German Workers fraternal greetings and wishes for their success in the struggle, and pledges itself to assist them in.every possible way.2o      This Conference calls upon the General Council of the T.U.C to organise conferences of workers inclusive of all industrial and political bodies, to declare solidarity with and support of the workers of Germany in their straggle against Imperialism.3.       This conference demands the immediate withdrawal of British troops, from Germany.4o      That the above resolutions be sent to thelabour party .Sxooutive and the General Council.5.      This conference appoints a Committee of.........to act as convenors of another Conference when the situation demands it.   The Committee to appoint a Secretary.&quot;The Chief Constable of Glasgow informs me that a &quot;HandOff Germany&quot; conference was held in the Central Hells onNovember 4th: . some 60 delegates representing variouslabour organisations were present:   the two followingresolutions were passed;&quot;That this Conference, representing Trade Unions, Trades Councils, local Labour parties. Unemployed Committees, Political end Co-operative Organisations, pledges its unanimous support to the German Workers in their struggle against Reactionary Dictatorship.   We condemn emphatically any tendency towards the British Labour Movement being neutral in this struggle, and demand that the Labour Movement in this country give every possible measure of active support to the German workers in their time of orisis.&quot;&quot;That this conference, representing the Labour Movement in the Clyde Valleys recognising the danger of the British troops being involved in the repression of the German workers, demands the immediate withdrawal from the occupied area in Germany of all British Forces.&quot;On November 11th some 1,200 people attended a communist meeting held at the Battersea Town Hall tocommemorate the Russian revolution:   the speakers wereR. Palme Dutt and H. Pollitt and A.II. wall was in the chair. i &apos; &apos;Another/
MMAnothar &quot;commemoration&apos;&apos; meeting was held at tie Baths, Prince of wales Road, Kentish Town, on November 7th but only about 450 people were present:   II. Bishop was in the chair and the speakers were A. McManus, J.T. Murphy and A.H. Hawkins.The meeting held in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, on November 7th was attended by about 3,000 people:   Tom Bell was chairman and the speakers were S. Saklatvala, M.P., M. Philips Price and Councillor Ellen Wilkinson.Bell Introduced about 30 Russian seamen who were on the platform and stated that they were the crew of a Russian boat then in Manchester Docks.   Price appealed for support for the demand for the withdrawal of British troops from Germany.     Saklatvala, who took Capitalism as his theme, received a great ovation.   Communists in the hall sold toys in aid of the workers1 International Russian Relief.During October MoManus reported to the Political Bureau the result of his visit to Dublin where he interviewed members of the Communist Party of Ireland and Jim Larkin:     the Political Bureau decided to suggest to the Presidium of the Communist International that the Communist Party of Ireland be liquidated and larkin encouraged to &quot;form a minority movement of the oppositions! elements in the trade unions and labour movement In Ireland&quot;.    A letter on these lines was sent to the Presidium in Moscow and the suggestions made were presumably adopted, as Gallacher has since been to Dublin to see .Larkin.On November 7th the Communist Party issued another &quot;Industrial Bulletin&quot; from which the following extracts are taken:&quot;BOILEEMMERS.The Boilermakers1 Society are asking for nominationat/
at their November monthly meeting for Delegates to attend the Trades Union Congress, Labour Party Conference and the General Federation of Trades Unions. It is desirable that aB many branches as possible should nominate Comrade Harry Pollitt.&quot;PISTBICT COMMITTEBS&quot;In most unions in the Engineering and shipbuilding trades nominations and elections take plaoe at the November and December branch meetings, for representatives to sit on the various District Committees for the next 12 months..   It is essential that our District party Committees secure the election of as many of our members as possible on these various Union Uistriot Committees..&quot;TRANSPORT AND GENERAL WORKERS&apos; UNION&quot;A National Conference is shortly to be h6ld (date not yet fixed) of delegates from the Dockers1 sent ion of this Union.   If any of our members in your District are elected &apos;to attend this conferences please inform us at once, giving the name and address of delegate elected., This should be done even where it is a sympathiser who maj; be eleoted.&quot;Comrade Crawford of Dundee has been nominated for the Executive Committee representing the Scottish area.   Will all our District and Locals in Scotland see that this comrade&apos;8 nomination is siwported when the ballot takes place in December.   Only Scotland is effected in this case. ,&quot;THE MINERS&quot;In view of tho possibility of a special delegate conference being called, please inform ua if any Party members or sympathisers are elected to attend the conference..&quot;BffgQR&apos;JEtS&quot;There has been a gratifying Increase in the number of reports received, also information in regard to trade union activities generally.   We hope that this will be mai.nta.ined.^CRADE UNION JOURNALS&quot;Muy we again urge districts and locals to take more advantage of the possibilities of these journals. We have had four journals printing articles for our members during the last month, which Is very encouraging,. *^M^GAMiCED SOCIETY OF WOODWORKERS&quot;The election for the General &apos;Council of the above Union is taking place any time now.   Members should support E. Blackball of Plaistow No. I,&quot;In/
In regard to the Trade Union congress the IndustrialCommittee of the Communist party states that:&quot;Standing Order Ho. 12 does not give the General Council power to do anything, either to oall for a levy, or Strike action not even to make it compulsory for unions to keep the General Council informed of all developments in the trade union movement.   Our amendment definitely gives the General Council power to make a financial levy and also call for strike action in.the event of it he lug necessary*     Comrades can easily see the need for the Council having such powers if the General Council it ever going to be able to function as the General Staff of the Trade Union Movement.&quot;Will comrades please inform the Industrial Committee if they are successful in getting the amendments through their branchesi&quot;The issue of &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; dated Hovember 9thcontained a &quot;Miners1 Call to Action&quot; written by A.J. Cook,wwho is a member of the Executive of the south Wales miners federation and one of the leaders of the Red Internationalof Labour Unions in this country:   the text of this appealis as follows:.    &quot;For over two years the miners of this country, especially in South Wales, have suffered beyond description.,   The agreement that Frank Hodges blessed has brought poverty and misery to the toilers of the mine,   patienoe has been exhausted.   Our people refuse to starve peacefully.   They claim the right to live.&quot;In every district a reduction of wages le taking place at the beginning of winter, when more clothes, bcots, and food are needed, and the cost of living is increasing.&quot;In South Wales we were reduced from Hoveraber 1 from 41c4? pe?? cent, to 88&quot;66 per cent. - from 6s. 3d. to 5s. 8*1. in the tl of earnings;   a reduction of 2s.Sd. in. the  11&quot;Wages fa.r Four Grades. under the Agreement.Per day 6 dayss. do         , s, d..Colliers on minimum .... 8.10. 2.13. 0.Timbermen............... 8. 4, 2.10. 1.Hauliers................ V. 6. 2. 5. 4.labourers............... 6. &apos;5. 1,18. 7.&quot;It is clear to everyone that the miners cannot live on the above wages, as stoppages, such asinsurance/m   6   *
insurance, clubs, etc, have to be deducted, while the miners buy their tools.   And already many of our collieries have started short time.&quot;There will be a conference in south wales immediately,   let the rank and file move quickly;   we cannot wait for ordinary&apos;constitutional methods to end the agreement.   That will take six months.   It will need a conference of the M.F.G-B.;   then Herbert Smith will demand a ballot;   then three months notice.***&apos;&apos;&quot;the W&amp;ges Question,&quot;The Compensation Question,&quot;The Slavery of the German Miners,&quot;These demand action at oncoi&quot;Souah Wales is preparing for the Struggle.&quot;The Communist Party is again paying special attention to women and has drawn up a supplement to the Party Training Syllabus from which the following extract is taken:&quot;WOMEN ASP CIVIL WAR&quot;As the situation develops and the situation becomes more emd more exploited, actual conflict between the forces of re-action and the revolutionary workers becomes inevitable.   It is then that the co-operation of women workers becomes most necessary.   It is during this period that the uninformed masses of women, who have not been connected in some way with the forces of Coirmunism, become the stronghold of the counter revolution.     The informed proletarian women are a source of strength to the base during the actual struggle.Robert Btawart, who is in Moscow, is now british representative on the International peasant Soviet (the peasant International).At the end of last week J.T. Walton Newbold was inFrance, where he was in close touch with leaders of theJ&apos;rQnch Party. *It would appear from the quotation given below fromc   letter dated Bombay, October 17th, 1923, and written byM.H. Ispahan! to ii. saklatvala, M.P., that the latterintends to visit Persia:&quot;I am glad you have made up,your mind to take a trip to Persia.   I am enclosing a letter addressed to my son in Teheran.   You, of course, have met him when he was in London.   I am sure he will do ell he can to be of service to your goodselves during your stay in Teheran.   I have, however, privately told him/

Losovsky informs Mfcnn that:&quot;It is absolutely necessary for you to attend not only owing to the situation in France but to drive home to the French Workers the necessity of supporting the German Workers in their struggle which is rapidly taking a definite foam.   Wo must have a definite decision, from this congress, for Unity and Act ion.&quot;;Mlour sections must   ej-press themselves now for real international solidarity,&quot;You will also take care to deal with the Anarchist Minority, who are opposing the German-revolution because it is led b;? the Communist Party. So we earnestly request that you attend the Congress in the name of the R.i-L.U. for we believe you can effectively deal with all questions that affoct our movement and it will *be very important for the French and the whole International Movement that you attend.&quot;She secretary of the International Propaganda Committee of Metal Workers has informed William Gellacher that the British Bureau&apos;s report regarding its activities cmong the engineers in this country has &quot;been captured by the brave police of the Social Democrat, Herr Richter&quot; and that &quot;the same gentleman has also in his hands the appeal and programme of the Amalgamated Engineering Union Minority Movement&quot;.

You are therefore recommended to destroy any documents you receive relative to the work of the group, such as this letter.&quot;As some of the ablest brains in the Communist party are represented on this group it will probably exercise considerable influence on the policy of the labour Research Department which, in turn, is an important factor in the.
