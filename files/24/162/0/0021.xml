(Memorandum &quot;by the financial Secretary to the Treasury)Cabinet approval is desired for the introduction of the attached Bill in the Autumn Session.    the 8 covering memorandum of the Chief Registrar of friendly:Societies explains the position and the need for passing the measure into lav; before 1 January 1924.    Ho opposition is anticipated.17. G.IgEASTJRY^^ S,W. - &apos; 18th October. 1923,
This Bill is the necessary corollary of the Opposition amendment to Section 4 of the Industrial Assurance Bill, 1923, accepted by the Government on the Report Stage in the House of Commbns, the Bill having already passed the House of Lords (see Hansard for 16th May, 1923, vol. 164, col. 521 - 526) i     The amendment increases, in the case of industrial assneance companies, the aggregate amounts which under Section 62 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896 can legally be insured1 or paid on the death of children under 10.It was accepted &quot;upon the strict understanding that hon. members opposite will not oppose any Measure which may be necessary to extend this proposal to friendly societies and trade unions -it cannot be done in this Session, but it may have to be done in another Session by a short non-contentious BUI&quot;.The Bill makes a general amendment to Section 62 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and thereby makes the increased amounts apply in the case of the other bodies which are subject to that section, namely ordinary friendly societies,  collecting societies and trade unions^   It is brought forward for the Autumn Session because the Industrial Assurance Awt, 1923, commences on January 1st, 1924y and It is extremely desirable that this Bill should   come into force on that datfc- also for the following reasons-(l)   Whereas the Industrial Assurance Act, 1925,, applies throughout to industrial assurance companies and collecting societies, which are defined, in Section 1 of the
Act, and to industrial assurance business as defined in the same section, whether conducted by one class of body or by the other Section 44as it at present stands, only extends the limits of the sums payable en the death of children In the oase of industrial assurance companies.     This was not In the least intended, and during the debate it was assumed that the extension applied in the case of collecting societies as well, but I think there can be no reasonable doubt that, on a proper construction of the section, it only applies to the, companies.(2)   Section 4 itself is inartistically drafted, although it is perfectly comprehensible.    The defect of it is that, in the exception, which forms the latter part of sub-section (1) of the section, the words cited from the friendly Societies Act, 1896) Section 62, for which other words are substituted, do not in fact exist in that Act, though it contains similar words&apos;of the same purports(5.)    Section 62 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, applies to all registered friendly societies (including collecting societies) and is also applied to trade unions by Section 2 of the Trade Union Act Amendment Act, 1876.      Unless the present Bill is passed, these other bodies will remain confined to the old limits, whereas industrial assurance companies;, which&apos;are in keen oompetitioi with them for the assurance of children, will have the&apos;&apos; advantage of the extended limits-As far as the merits of the Bill itself, apart from the legal reasons, for its passage, a?:e concerned, it is intended to meet the largely increased cost of funeralsand
Ci 1 and everything connected with them, which is referred&apos; to in detail in cols. 523 - 525 of Hansard Vol. 164 and is unquestionable.The passage of the Bill before January 1st, 1924, is urgently asked for by the National Conference of Friendly Societies, by important Individual societies such as the Ancient Order of Foresters and the Hearts of oak Benefit Society and by the collecting societies, or such of them as have grasped that Section 4 of the Industrial Assurance Act has not increased the limits in their ease. In a letter to the Hearts of ftek on July 4th last the Prime1 Minister expressed the hope that It would be possible \% Introduce the Bill In the Autumn Sessions.(sd) G. STUART ROBERTSON
