This Document is the Property ofis Britannic ftf;aj2sty&apos;s GovernmentSECRET,G,P. 481 (23l).CABINETTHE KING&apos;S SPEECH,Notes by the Secretary of State for Air&apos;,It is with great diffidence that I circulate the following notes to my colleagues upon the question of the King&apos;s Speech.   Indeed I should not venture to aBk their consideration of my observations, did I not know that I am expressing the views of several representative members of the Party,Should the King&apos;s Speech be a bold restatement of our election programme in terms of projected legislation, or should its proposals be modified by the verdict that the country has given against protection?   These appear to me to be the two questions that the Cabinet is called upon to answer.Personally, I have not the least desire to avoid or delay a challenge from the Opposition, and&apos; I take the view that the sooner we are in opposition the stronger will be our position, Moreover I am fully sensitive to,the strengthening and stimu-lating effect of sticking to a programme and pushing it with unabated vigour and enthusiasm from the vantage ground of opposition.None the less I am greatly impressed by the following contentions in favour of a modified programme, ,/,/ (1)    If a general election takes place in the near future,It seems impossible to hope for any sub-stantial change in favour of Conservatism, if we fight upon a programme identical with that of the last election. This consideration is very serious in view of the great importance of the next election. -Opinion will differ as to the date when another election is likely to take.place.. From what I hear from&amp;&apos;
- 2 -Labour sources I gather that tho Left of the Labour Party deslrcs -n immediate appeaL-trO the country upon nr. txtrcmc programme.   Whether the Itft gets its way or not, it seems to mo probable, that the position will be so unstable in the House of Commons as to make an election inevitable before the.autumn.   If this is tho case, I do not believe that in so short a time we can hope to win any substantial number of scats upon an exact repetition of our last programme.(2)      substantial number of candidates will refuse to fight upon an unchanged programme.In the conferences that, at the Prime Minister&apos;s request, the President of the Board of Education, the Postmaster General and I have been having with Colonel Jackson at the Central Office, I have been much impressed by such statements as that of Sir Reginald Blair, a man who knows more than anyone of political opinion in London.   Sir Reginald Blair states definitely that there is not the least hope of winning the lost London seats upon an unchanged, programme, and that the majority of London candidates will refuse to fight upon it.   Although I am, myself, prepared to fight Chelsea upon an extreme protection programme, I share Sir Reginald Blair&apos;s&apos; view. The London situation has now greatly changed.   The election has shown that the classes upon which we have mainly depended in the past, the small shopkeepers, the clerks, the suburban rentiers and pensioners have had so many bitter lessons of the high cost of living that they are determined not.to risk the loss of even a few shillings or pounds a year as a result of a general tariff, whilst in no constituency In London, so far as I know, was there
any ccnntfvervaiJLlng sympathy for the unemployed.If my London impressions- are- supported by the experience of the provinces, I think that the wisest course would be so to modify the King&apos;s Speech as to make it possible to fight tho next election upon an altered programme.   By an altered programme I do not mean a programme in which protection is repudiated.     I mean rather a programme in which stability in face of the Labour programme takes the first place, and a more cautious advance towards protection takes the second.It seems to me vital that v;e should without delay attempt to regain our position as the party of stability, namely the party to which the non-partisan of moderate views will instinctively turn as the strongest bulwark against social or economic revolution.   Mr. Bonar Law fought and won on the programme of tranquillity.    I should like to see the next election fought and won. on the programme of stability.As to protection, I should frankly accept the fact that the country is opposed to sudden and sweeping change, and that it will only be convinced in stages and by actual experience.   By actual experience I*mean the application of the McKenna luties and of the Safeguarding of Industries Act on a wider scale and by a more expeditious procedure to industries or sections of industries in which a case for protection has definitely been established.   It is the general tariff that the country fears at present.    In my view the line of least resistance for ultimately obtaining a general tariff is      the line of experimental advance by stages.Is to Imperial Preference we should of course pledge ourselves to implement the agreements of the Economic Conference.   I think, however, we should go further and at once set up an enquiry to see whether it is not possible to
develop the Empires food, supplies by means other than duties.I believe that on a programme of this kind VYe could hope to retrieve our position at the next election. If this is so the King&apos;s Speech should be so drafted, as to harmonize with our future policy.The sooner that we can make it clear that our policy is first and foremost stability, and soconlly protection, by   hat I would call Ebipfcpieal means, the sooner I believe shall we attract to the Conservative party the big non-partisan vote that will drift to Liberalism if the Liberals appear to offer the strongest safeguard against extreme Labour.I may add that I should personally much like to see in the Speech as much emphasis as possible laid upon   the more satisfactory turn that Anglo-French relations seem, to be taking and the Inclusion of further proposals for extending unemployment relief measures.Particularly also do I desire to keep our Agricultural programme in the Speech even though it was contingent upon industrial protection.S.H.Air Ministry, Secretary of State for Air.15th December,1923,
