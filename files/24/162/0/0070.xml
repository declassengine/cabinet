fTHIS DOetTMEW! IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITMtilC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOTEfflMBM!.CABINET.SECRET.0 &apos;P* 470 (25).&apos;EMERGENCY   BUSINESS   COMivil TTEE.THIRD REPORT.
PISH ABB THE      1.   The Committee had before them a Note (E.B.C, 9) PROPOSED TAB IFF.by the Secretary relative to an urgent enquiry received from tho Hull Fishmongers1(Association enquiring whether Fish is included in the articles of food which will not be taxed; a telegram (E.B..C. 11) addressed by Lord Derby to the Prime Minister suggesting that Mr. Baldwin should not pledge himself not to impose a tax on Fish brought; to this country by foreign trawlers, and also a      \x Memorandum by tho Chief Inspector of Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, (Appendix US&quot;).The Committee were informed that the Secretary forjiScotland was definitely opposed to the taxation of imported foreign Fish on the ground that Fish formed one of the staple articles of food of tho poor.The attention of the Committee was drawn to the fact that Fish was not upon the list of imported articles on which the Government had undertaken to impose no taxation.   The view was expressed that it to uld be undesirablo at the present juncture either to. attempt to add to or subtract items from the list in question.The Committee agreedTo recommend that * reply on the following lines should be sent by Colonel Jackson to his correspondent&quot;Fish is not included in the listof imported articles which theGovernment do not propose in anyoiroumstanoos to tax, but a tax on imported Fish would not be proposedexcept after full and careful enquiry.&quot;
iattf Committee had before them a copy of a letterfrom the Unionist Central Office cotsring an enquiry as to the reason for the exclusion of flour from the Tariff on Foreign Imports.The Committee were reminded that in hisdeclaration of policy in the House of commons onthe 15th November. 1923, the Prime Minister had stated that the Government did not propose inany circumstances to put any tax on Wheat, Flour,Meat (Mutton as well as Beef), Cheese, Butter,Eggs, Bacon.   While no doubt such a tax would assist the Milling Industry, which was at presentiiin a depressed condition, it was doubtful whether the farmers would derive much advantage, if any, from the tax on imported foreign J?lour. &apos; It was not the case as-represented in the correspondent &quot;s letter that a tax on Flour bad been pressed for by the Dominion Representatives at the recent Imperial Economic Conference.   The Representatives of Canada and Australia,, the Dominions mainly concerned, were in fact opposed to any such action.   The Committee agreed to recommend that a reply on the following lines should be addressed to the correspondent in question, &quot;After very careful consideration and havin regard to the effect of any tax on       Imported Flour on the price of food, the Government had decided to place Flour on the list of articles which they did not propose in any circumstances to subject to an Import tax.&quot;The correspondent should be told that he is mistaken in thinking that the Dominions pressed for the imposition of such a tax at the recent meetings of the Imperial Economic Conference.
jtySBSIOHS.   THE BRITISH LEGION&apos;S (4UB0TIONNAIBB.QUESTION3.     Jhe Committee had before them the British Legion1s Questions to Parliamentary Candidates (E.B.C.. 8) Appendix I, and also suggested replies whioh had been prepared&apos;by the Departments oonoerned.-fi-fter careful consideration the Committee agreed:-To rocommend that the following replies should bo sent to the British Legion:-(Where necessary Notes for the information and guiiafieo of,.Uandldates hare beenappended to the rvpliis).BSPLY   .1.    Would you support the polioy of 1.     I am in favour ofthe Legion that, in Government and Municipal a reasonable preferenceemployment and in all schemes for employ-meat financed or controlled by the National or Local Authorities, or guaranteed under the Trades E&apos;facilities lot, ex-service men should be given preference?to ex-Servico men and this is already the accepted policy of the Government. Note.It is a condition of grants by the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport to Local Authorities for relief works that, save in very special oases, at least 7$7flW$ of the men engaged shall be ex-Service men.2.    Are you in favour of setting up a National Employment Committee to advise upon and recommend to the Government Employment Soh ernes *f ^public Utility?   This Committee to be non-party in composition representative in character, and navinp purely advisory powers.&apos; . In( order to finance immediately wofi schemes as are suitable are you t0 layour of floating a National Work oan to be publicly subscribed, since &quot;9 9&quot;orts to absorb the 900,000 ^employed ex-service men by provision ^ of current revenue have proved unsuccessful?2.   There is already a special, Committee of the Cabinet dealing with all aspects of the Unemploy-ment problem.   Through this Committee the Govern-re,ceive expert advice and are in constant touoh with the Cabinet and the Treasury.   The Government are convinced that the establishment of another Committee would only lead to delay in dealing with schemes.3.     The Government are advised that an attempt to float such a Soan would adversely affect the unemployed.   In this connection I would draw attention to the following extracts from the reply,
QUESTION. 3, (Oontd.)4, In view of the findingsthe Select Committee of the House of Commons on the volun- &apos; tary scheme to secure employ-tient for disabled men are you prepared to support legislation introducing a compulsory scheme for the allocation on a scientif lo basis of disabled men to industry?5. Are you in favour of the tegion1 s oollcy that the posit-ion of ex-service Smallholders throughout this country should be reviewed with a view to Proper and expert assistance and advice being given to grouossmallholders with a view to improving their present position?REPLY.of the Prime Minister dated 17th November, 1923, to the British Legion manifesto :-&quot;I do not think It can be disputed that the raising of so large a sum ( 200.000,000) would at once bring to a standstill the loan operations of Local Authorities, of the Trade Facilities Committee, and of the Dominions for Empire Development, and it would thus stultify most of the arrangements which are now In pro-aress for the relief of unemployment&quot;,4. I am in favour of every encourage-ment being given to voluntary effort to, provide employment for disabled men and I should deprecate any resort to compulsion unless and until it has been shown that voluntary efforts have failed to achieve their object.- Accordingly I am fully In sympathy with the following extract from.the Interim Report of the Kingls Roll National Council, a Body of whioh Earl Haig is Chairman and which includes among other prominent members of the Legion Major General Sir John Davidson, Major Cohen, Mr, fts^Um^-^JU^. and Capt, Appleby. ;-&quot;The Council have formed the con-concluslon that the system of decentral-ised voluntary effort is rlgM. Provided therefore that the&quot;winter does not bring another severe slump in trade, we believe that with the continued assistance of the Local .Committees and the Press, and the maintenance, at least, of the present support given by the public, It should be possible to make, by existing means, ooupled with the recommenda-tions we have submitted, a substan-tla1 improvement in the position, without recourse to alternative methods of compulsion,&quot;5, Yes.   I am heartily in favour of every possible help being given to ex-service smallholders by way of expert advice and assistance, particularly by giving      special Instructions to the County Agricultural and Rortl-cultural organisers and instructors in England and Wales end to the cor-responding officials in Scotland, to place their services at the disposal of ex-service smallholders, and by oil other available means such as the provision of demonstration plots, etc
6. Are you in sympathy with the League of Nations and will you support all steps taken in the direction of securing permanent peace?

Yes. I am in full sympathy with the League and will cordially support its efforts to secure permanent peace.



7. Do you support the Legion&apos;s policy that November 11th should be instituted as a National Day of Commemoration and will you resist any attempts to minimise the solemn observances of the day?

I am in favour of the continued observance of Armistice Day as a National Day of Commemoration and I will oppose any attempts to minimise the solemn observances of the day.



8.In order to check the high death-rate among tubercular ex-service men, who, having been temporarily cured in sanatoria, relapse owing to their return to prejudicial surroundings, will you support the establishment of Village Settlements for tubercular ex-service men on the lines of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report of 1919?

I desire that everything possible should be done for ex-service men suffering from tuberculosis, but at present it has not been established that the placing of such men permanently in settlements of the kind referred to is the best solution of the difficulty. The Government have agreed to make a grant to provide additional cottages for tubercular ex-service men at each of the two existing village settlements, and this experiment will be carefully and sympathetio?lly watched.



9. Will you support the continuance of a separate Ministry of Pensions, there being still 699,000 disabled men, 164,000 widows, and 1,547,000 other dependents in receipt of pensions and allowances?

Yes, so long as the matter of beneficiaries remains at anything like the present figure. The interests of pensioners must determine the matter.



10. Are you in favour of the rates of pensions being permanently fixed, and will you strenuously oppose any attempt to reduce the present standard rate of pensions?

I am in favour of securing permanently stabilised rates of war pension ad should be opposed to any attempt, under present conditions, to reduce the pension rates of disabled men.



Note. A Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1919 in recommending ? considerable addition to the scale of pensions then in force proposed that the addition should be dependent on the cost of living. To prevent frequent variations in the rates of pension the Government of the day fixed the amounts for three years, but when the question came to be reviewed in 1922 it was found that this arrangement had operated to the disadvantage of the pensioners and the present Government accordingly decided to continue the existing rates for another 3 years, i.e. until 1st April, 1926. Towards the end of that period the matter will of course have to be reviewed in the light of the cost of living at that date but it ? hoped that it will then be found possible to fix pensions permanently on a basis which will do full justice to the claims of the disabled men.


QUESTION.Are you in favour of the Ifotion of the seven-year a in connection with, widows1 Lons and in favour of the k being given to a widow to f forward a claim to pension enever her hushand1 s death T occur, and who receives ^ pension if the death Is t0 or aggravated by war rvioe?Will you support the Legion&apos;s aim for ?.n enquiry into the thod of assessment of Final ards of Pensions in view of e fact that 230,000 disabled men re been wiped off the pensions st through the operation of the Hnal Awards Regulations since jiuary 1st, 1922, and are thtas deluded from claiming further pensions even if their condition ,9 become worse?, Are you in favour of the st-war disabled men and the dos of the post-war sailor, Idler or airman having the ght of Appeal to the Lord ianoellor&apos;8 Pensions Appeals lbunel on the question of nslon in the same way as .e Great War disabled man or dow has the Right of Appeal?REPLY.&quot;Are you satisfied that a nslon of 10/sd. per week is equate for the widow of a Idler who has died of a dis-:ulty due to service since september 30th, 1921?    Will 1 press for this amount to increased?11, I am in favour of the widow of any disabled man whose death is due in a material degree to the effects of War service &apos; being entitled to put forward a claim to pension whenever the death occurs *12. Every disabled man who receives a Final Award from the Ministry of Pensions, is, I under-stand, safeguarded by a Right of Appeal to an independent Appeal Tribunal,     It would bea serious matter to upset the Final Awards already made and would not be in the interests of disabled men.     If, however, any change in method is clearly shown to be necessary the Government would, no doubt, be prepared to givo the matter careful consideration,13. In my opinion the existing rights of Post-tVar Pensioners are sufficiently safeguarded. Soldiers pensions are awarded by the Commissioners of Chelsea Hospital, a predominantly military body which is not subject to the control of the war Office in its administration of the pension regulations, and I doubt whether lt is desirable to provide for the indefinite continu-an c.c.   of the expensive system of Pensions Appeals Tribunals by giving the tribunals jurisdiction over post-war pensions.14. The 10/6d. rate is the rate of pension of a young and childless widow able to earn her living. This is double the rate given before the War to the widows of men in the Army and Navy. Allow-ances are also paid to widows jtith children, and to those unable to earn a living. (Note)10/6d. is the rate for the widow of a private under 40 years of age and without children - there Is an extra allowance for children -this rate is Inoreased to 17/6d. in the case of a widow with a child or children or over 40 years of age and in the case of a childless&quot; widow under 40 who cannot earn -a widow over 50 gets&apos; 20/&quot;-&apos; additions ranging from l/6d - 7/6d. accord-ing to&quot;the rank of the soldier are made.It will be seen that the 10/6d, has no pretence to be a
QUESTIONREPLY&quot;living income&quot; and it is considered adequate.   The marri&amp;ge allowance for the childless wife of a private soldier during his life Is 7/- with an index figure of(No moderate increase would satisfy this demand).80.15.

IHJ5 CHURCH       4.    The Committeo had under consideration a letter ASSOCIATIONSQU3STI0BHAIRE. dated 22nd November, 1923, addressed to the Prime Minister by the Church Association relative to certain proposals for the Revision of the   Prayer Book,Tho Committeo were informed that in reply to a similar enquiry from the Association in November 1922, Mr. Bonar Law had stated that If the proposals in question ever came before Parliament for sanction they would have his careful consideration, especially as regards the points mentioned by the Association, but until then ho regretted that he did not feel able to express an opinion on the matter.The Committee agreed:-To recommend the Primo Minister to reply to the Church Association&apos;s letter on the following lines:-&quot;The question of the Revision of thePrayer Book is now receiving considerationby the National Assembly and I am not ina position to say what the outcome ofthe Assembly&apos;s deliberations will be.In the event, however, of any Measuredealing with the matters to whioh yourefer ooming before Parliament theGovernment will   give the whole questiontheir earnest and careful consideration. &quot;

Before the War the two first-named countries fished almoot entirely for the German markets and now, owing to the impoverishment of that country, they are bound to find other markets, and that of this country is the only eno available.    &amp;Tho German fishing fleets also find their homo markets incapable of absorting the fish they can catch at remunerative prices and are forced, in order to continue operations, to dump considerable quantities in this country. This dumping by the Germans, and to a less degree that by the Danish, is facilitated by the rate of gxohange, as they pay their wages and other expenses In German currency and sell their fish for sterling.The competition of the Norwogiansconsists mainly of fresh herrings which are brought hare in the early part ofthe year.   This competition is comparatively harmless as thereis very little fishing going on in our waters at that time andthe producers of kippers, red herrings and bloaters in thiscountry would, at.times, be unable to obtain the fish they require but for this importation.   It. cannot, therefore, hesaid that the herring fishermen really require proteotion   --1-
in home markets.On the other hand the trawlers and other branches, of th-VIndustry who catch white fish are being very seriously affected by foreign oenpetition.Tho following table shews the total amount of British and Foreign trawl fish brought into this oountry, and the peroentage which the Fereign caufht boars to the total.Year	British awts.

vessels? which catch it to the fishing ports, hut is collected in Denmark and then sent over direct to Ell;ingsgate in large quantities and at irregular-intervals, thus disorganising tho markets and so causing waste of English fish which, owing to the abnormally large quantities in the London market, is sometimes unsaleable at the ports.Even if the exclusion of foreign fish were to cause a deficiency in our supplies for a time, the deficiency would soon be made up by the building of new trawlers, which would certainly be laid down if the trawler owners saw any prospect of the improvement of business.There is a very little risk of any increase of the price of fish to1 the consumer, as the retail price of it has reached the economic level at which it can sonpete with meat, end, provided that supplies of meat remain adequate, it will not be possible for the retailers to ;t.ut up the price of fish.So far as the Trawling Industry is concerned, there is no doubt that the restriction of foreign imports of fish, other than herring, would be beneficial, but any proposal to do so Is likely to be opposed both by the merchants and by the herring industry, but on entirely different grounds.The merchants naturally wish to have abundant supplies to deal in, at low prices, and arc not particular as to where they come from.   The result of the alight surplus of fish that there has beon recently has boen that the merchants have been able to force the catchers to take lose than their fair share of the price paid by the public for the fish.   This is, of course, due to the fact that the catchers are bound to sell the fish on arrival, aid cannot hold it up for a better price. The opposition of the Herring Industry is based-3- &apos; . &apos;
on the fear that if a protective tariff is placed on German exports of fish to this country, the Germans will retaliate by placing a tax upon British pickled herring exported into Germany,   This fear seems to he unfounded on two grounds; firstly, boo&amp;use as any general tariff imposed by the country must be direct od, very largely against Germany, the Germans will, whether their fish is taxed by us or not, retaliate by any means which they have available;   and, secondly, because the Germans cannot got nitrogenous food of any other kind as cheaply as pickled herrings, which can be delivered in any German port at the price of about 1^-d. per lb.   It is true that Germany can obtain a certain amount of pickled herring from Scandinavian countries and Holland, but the herring   from those countries is of inferior quality and not adequate in quantity for Germany&apos;s needs,There will also be a certain amount of opposition from the salt fish trade at Aberdeen, who depend for their sup-lies upon fish caught in Icelandic waters by German ships, and whose product of cured fish is entirely disposed of abroad.   At present the Aberdeen fishing industry does not prosecute the Iceland fishing, but an attempt is being; made to develop it.   If this import of German fish was entirely stopped, there is no doubt that this  rade, whioh is of groat value to Aberdeen, would come to an end.    It is, however, suggested that the position at Aberdeen might be met by granting a rebate upon all cured fish exported equivalent to the duty charged on fresh fish.November, 1923.

S*W.1,copy f.f the Prime Minister&apos;s Reply to the above letter.10 Downing Street, S.W-1;20th November, 1923.I am asked to define the attitude of this Government tc the League of Nations.    I am only too glad to do so.We are whole-heartedly in support of the aims which the League of Nations seeks to further,    I can perhaps hardly define our attitude in this matter - and indeed that of the.whole Empire - better than by quoting the words of the recently published account of the work of the. Imperial Conference which has just concluded its sittings.   The words are as follows:- &quot;Finally the
Conference, after listening to a detailed exposition of the work of the League of Nations during the past two years, and more particularly of the recent sitting of tho Council and the -Assembly at Geneva, placed on record its emphatic approval of the action that had&quot; been taken by, and the support that had been given to, the representatives of the British Empire on the latter occasion.    There was full 6iecord that the League should be given the unabated support of all tho British members of the League as a valuable organ^ for the harmonious regulation of many international affairs.&quot;(Signed) STANLEY BAlLVsIii, -i \J.C.

Three-fifths of K members   are  representatives   of  Approvedicties.scheme in a satisfactory financial condition ? -doubtedly : in addition to the necessary reserves [sect the increased cost of benefits at later ages, (ties in general at the last valuation had a surplus l* aggregate of over  17,000,000 in addition to M  6,000,000 in contingencies funds.    About one-of the  17,000,000 is now being used in the *ion of additional benefits.II.-DOCTORS&apos; CAPITATION FEE11* this question arousing so much controversy at*sc the Insurance Doctors&apos; agreement expires on 31st December next, and it is necessary to deter-&quot;&apos; al what rate they are to be paid as from - 1st &quot;&quot;y next. The 14,000 panel doctors and 8,000 proved Societies and branches in all parts of the *)&apos; arc interested.&quot;rcas the pre-War figure for the payment of doctors ? R insured person per annum. This figure was Wed by the Government in 1912 after prolongedRations and only when it became clear that no llgure would secure an adequate medical service.
hen was this figure increased ?i the latter years of the War, owing to changed rioraic conditions, the figure gradually rose until 920, as the result of arbitration, it was fixed at 11/-.Sen did the present figure of 9/6 come into force ? arly in 1922 the doctors, in response to an appeal the Government, agreed to a reduction from 11/-to 6 for the years 1922 and 1923.fa did the doctors ash from 1924 onwards ?ky asked for payment for a term of five years, at a[lire somewhere between 9/6 and 10/9.hi did the Societies say to this request ? The Approved Societies&apos; Consultative Council of Ministry of Health (a body set up by Order in mncil to advise the Minister, and composed of prescntatives of Approved Societies nominated by Minister) recommended payment of 8/- for the next years.The Consultative Council of the Scottish Board Health (a similarly constituted body) recommended for the next three years.4 general Conference of Societies said, in effect, c don&apos;t care what the Government pays the tors, so long as we are not asked to pay more than per head.&quot;&quot;* the representatives of Labour expressed any viewsDie subject ?e General Council of the Trades Union Congress and National Executive of the Labour Party have tptal the Report of their Committee to the effect &apos;t the continuance of the present figure of 9/6 is ^ificd and that the money can be found in the tonal Health Insurance Funds.did the Government do ?Government offered the doctors the alternative ins as recommended bv their Consultative Councils. Ml) and (2) of No. 6 &quot;above.)
It-What happened ? The doctors refused both offers and handed in 13,000 resignations, being 94 per cent, of all the panel doctors in the country.What was the next stage in the negotiations ? The Government made an exhaustive examination of the subject and came to the conclusion that, in the hope of effecting a settlement, an offer of 8/6 for five years should be made. Before finally deciding, the Government consulted the Government Actuary, who advised that Societies in general could bear this charge without endangering the continuance of the existing benefits (including the additional benefits already declared).What was the final offer of the Government ? (o) 8/6 for five years, or (b) the immediate appointment of an independent Court of Inquiry to advise as to the proper figure from 1st January, 1924.&quot;hat is the present position ?The doctors have elected to take the Court of Inquiry and abide by its decision. That Court is now being set up, and the Approved Societies have been invited jo put their views before it. Pending the result of the Inquiry no further action is possible, and it would be Most improper to ask for any pledge until the decision 15 known.-POSSIBLE QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTED ANSWERSyou aware that before the Insurance Act, many of &quot;X Friendly Societies obtained Medical Attendance and rugs for 4/- per member per annum ?j-A but according to the Report of Sir William lender only l  attendances per annum were given person. Under the Insurance Act, the yearly attendances are over 3J per member the service is infinitely better-better drugs, better attendance looth day and night) without any extras, and absolute &apos;rw choice of doctor.
Arc you aware that, at the commencement of the Insurance id,&apos;the doctors forced the Government to give 7/3 per \ead, although the Government thought that i/6 to 5/6 -as the proper figure ? [his is true, but it proved impossible to organise a ompletc comprehensive medical service for 15,000,000 people at a rate which individual societies could obtain locally, for an i nferior service, to a limited number of people.Could not the Societies organise a complete medical mice at a lower rate ?Certainly not. Societies as a rule are not organised ii a territorial basis. Their members are scattered 11 over the country. They have said repeatedly that they do not desire to administer the Medical Benefit, nd Parliament in 1911, by a direct vote, decided that it was not desirable that the doctors should be placed under the control of Societies, even if the doctors were willing as they are not&apos; to be placed in that position.Is it true that the general finances of the Act only provide i/3 for the doctors ?if so. is there any justification for placing any higher charge upon the Societies&apos; Funds ? It is true that the general finances of the Act of 1920 &quot;nly .illocated 7/3 for the doctors but recent inves-Sgatibns have proved that the Societies&apos; Funds are in *uch a flourishing condition that appreciably more than &apos;/3 can be borne by Societies, in general, without endangering the continuance of the existing benefits including the additional benefits already declared).&quot;u(, why should the Funds of Societies be. &quot; raided &quot; &apos;0 an extent which may prevent Societies from still further increasing their additional benefits ? Many Societies will be able to still further increase uieir additional benefits at the next Valuation even it tiny have to bear a somewhat higher charge than j/3 m respect of the Doctors.I&quot; any case Medical Benefit is a primary benefit an ancient medical service is, in itself, of the utmost Importance to Insured Persons  and from the point &quot;view of the Funds of the Societies, it is vital lor the Weguarding of those Funds, if deficiencies are to be &quot;voided, and any money is to remain for giving addi-tional benefits. &apos;
.-Even if it is true that many Societies can give an extra(payment to the Doctors and continue their additional benefits, what about the Societies which cannot^qfford to do this ?These will be comparatively few in number, and in any case, the Government has undertaken that any Society which falls into deficiency by reason of an extra charge for medical benefit will be recouped out of the. Central Fund to the extent of that deficiency.^   ;;-Bui some Societies may not fall into deficiency, and yet may not be able to continue their existing additional benefits.In view of the large reserves which were brought forward by each Society at the last Valuation, and the increased rates of interest which have been earned on investments, - such societies will be comparatively few in number, and as a rule, their comparatively unfavour-able position will be due not to any extra charge which they may have to bear for the payment of the Doctors, but to other adverse circumstances which have, operated since the last Valuation.-Why should the Societies&apos; Administration Allowance be reduced to 4/5, and the Doctors get so much as, say, 8/6 ? The Societies have come down from a maximum of 4/10 to 4/5. The Doctors were asked to come down from 11/- to 8/6. The 4/5 is 29 per cent, over the prc-War figure. 8/6 is only 17 per cent, over the prc-War figure.Is it not the case that the Doctors receive payment for a great number of Insured Persons xvlw are not on anyDoctors List?Yes, but many of these persons only go on a Xist when they fall sick and need treatment. The Doctors are always &quot; at risk,&quot; and, as an Insurance proposition, they are entitled to be paid.&apos;^If the Insurance Funds have to bear the whole cost of the Doctors&apos; remuneration, should not the Societies make the bargain with the Doctors?No. The Societies are entitled to represent their views, and will be given opportunity to do so before the Court of Inquiry which is being set up to advise the Government. It must be remembered that the Government and the Employers contribute over 60 per cent, of the contributions.0
Should not the Exchequer pay any excess awarded over the 7/8 per foad ?Certainly not. The Exchequer already gives  6,000,000 per annum by statutory State grants to National Health Insurance. The scheme is in a position of great financial strength, and it would be most unfair to the Taxpayer to ask him to contribute anything more, merely to enable further additional benefits to be granted.-If the Doctors got, say, 8/6, would it not mean than an extra  5,000,000 would be taken out of the funds of the I Societies during the next five years ?Yes, but at the last Valuation the Approved Societies had a surplus   assets over liabilities   of over  17,000,000 in addition to over  6,000,000 of Con-contingency Reserve Funds. Only about one-half of the  17,000,000 is being expended on additional benefits.-It it not the case that the present Medical Service is not only restricted in scope, but, frequently, also unsatis-fuctory in character ?The scheme, although infinitely superior to that of the pre-Insurance contract system, is necessarily restricted until funds are available to provide a complete service (including specialists, etc.).All the evidence goes to show that the character of the service is steadily improving, and negotiations have just been completed with the Doctors which will remove most of the defects which have previouslyexisted.In addition to this a Royal Commission is being set up to overhaul the whole system.u:0  ?)&apos; ftiE National Unionist Association, palace chambers, bridge st., trouiater, s.W.i, and printed by The National Publicity Agency, 29 charing cross, s.w. im

During the past ton years the doctors have been paid at rates varying from 7s* 3d... to 11s. per annum for each insured person for whose treatment they ere responsible. At the present time the rate is 9s. 6d.    The present agreement terminates on 31st December next and the question at Issue Is the proper rate of payment for 1924 and onwards.The General Council of the Trade Union Congress and the National Executive of the Labour Party have accepted a report of a Committee to the effect that the continuance of the present fee of 9s. 6cU Is Justified and..that the money   -2. be found^from the National Health Insurance gundsu    The Approved Societies&apos; Consultative Council of the Ministry of Health recommended payment at the rate of 8s. for the next five years and the corresponding Scottish body 8s, 6d. for the next three years.    A large Conference of Approved Societies of all types said, in effect, that they wore unconcerned as to the rate at which the Government decided to,pay the doctors but that not more than 7s * 3d* per head should be taken from Societiesr funds for the purpose.The doctors refused to accept payment at the rate of 8s. for five years or 8s. 6d. for three years, and about 94$ of all panel doctors throughout the country sent in their resignations by way of protest against either of these offers.After the most, careful consideration of the merits of the case, I decided f in order l^o secure a settlement, to offer 3s. 6d* for five years,or, as an.alternative, that the figure should be determined by an independent Court of Inquiry to be set up at once.The doctors have accepted the latter alternative and I am now in communication with both sides settling the exact terms of reference.
In the meantime, I may say that I have secured the invaluable services of Mr.T.R. Hughes, K.C., (the Chairman of the Bar Council) Mr. Goodenough (the Chairman of Barclay&apos;s Bank) and Sir Josiah Stamp, K.C.B., (the sole survivor of the Arbitrators who made an award on this question in 1920). I am sure everyone will agree that one could not have an abler or more impartial tribunal.

Many Approved Society representatives maintain that no greater sum than 7s. 3d. per head can be taken from the funds of Societies without curtailing either the ordinary cash benefits or the additional benefits which they are already providing for their members. In fact, however, the Government Actuary has advised that Societies, in general, can find anything up to 8s. 6d. from their funds for the next five years without endangering the continuance of existing benefits (including additional benefits already in operation).

Here the matter rests for the present.



Both sides will have the fullest access to the Court and I hope as the matter is sub?judice, candidates will be able to decline any further pledge beyond agreeing to accept the decision of the Court.
