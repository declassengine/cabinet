LABOUR UNIONS....    &quot;     8THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LlhiCUE................    &quot;   11THE UNEMPLOYED.,...........................    &quot;   12&apos;IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IKGREAT BRITAIN.........................    &quot;   13SUMMARYOn October 8th the wholly -unemployed on the live registers totalled approximately 1,251,600, &quot;an increase of 5,413 on the preceding week:   on the same Gate the number working short time and draw hip benefit for intorvala of unemployment was 66,200, as compared with 74,702 on October 1st.The Communist Party is in financial difficulties:   an Important doeumsut which outlines the re-arrangement of paid offices in the provinoea is quoted in this report.Prom the reports so far available, it seems that the Autumn Campaign has resulted in increased attendance at communist meetings.The Communist Party of Great Britain end the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions are still devoting a great deal of propaganda to the situation in Germany.The Young Communl3t league is holding, its annual conference in&apos;London next week-end.
paid/On October   12th the national seoretary of the flsmmunlst Party made an Important statement upen the finanoial diffioultlea of the Party and the re-arrangement In the payment of District Organisers thereby neoessltated: this document seems of sufficient importance to quote in extensa:&quot;Arising out of a communication recently rcoeived frem the District Party Organisers, and following upon reports received from Comrade Pollitt as to discussions he has had with these oomrades and other district party representatives, the Central Exeoutive Committee at Its last two meetings has had under careful consideration the whole question of tho present finanoial situation In regard to the district party organisations, particularly in respeot to the personal position of the district party organisers,&quot;The economic position of the majority of the distriot party organisers is unquestionably a matter for very grave concern.     The Central Executive Committee fully appreciates! the very useful service that all these comrades are rendering to the Party, and none would be better pleased than tho Central Executive Committee itself if it were within its 3ower to assist these comrades by increasing the weekly grant that is nsw made from headquarters to the distriot party committees.    Unfortunately, however, such a proposal is absolutely impracticable at the present time:   and tho finanoial position of the Party itself is rapidly approaching a crisis.    Hot only have we had tho greatest difficulty In the world in meeting the normal expenditure of the Party during tho past nine months, but the Central Executive Committee is now faced with the additional expense attached to carrying out the new tasks of the party as laid down by the Presidium of the Communist International, whioh expenditure has to be mot out of the normal party income.    The rosponso to our efforts te rai30 funds by means of speoial appeals has been extremely disappointing.    Up to the moment eur appeal far tho Autumn Campaign has produced loss than  50, or barely sufficient to meet the travelling expenses of the speakers who are boing sent to the different demonstrations at the end t*f this week.    Plans that we had formulated for the issue of special literature in connection with the Autumn Campaign have had to be abandoned:   instead of Issuing a series of four leaflets in quantities of 100,000 copies each, we havo so far enly been able to issue one leaflet in an edition of 50,000 oqples for the whtle of the oountry,&quot;The Central Executive Committee is aware that some feeling exlstB at the fact that tho party has at the present time a Political Bureau at headquarters,&apos; some of whose members are employed in a full-time
paia capacity, and there is a tendency in some quarters to oomparo that situation with the unfortunate eoonomic position of certain of the district organisers. The suggestion is sometimes implied, although we have no reason to suppose that such a feeling is generally prevalent within the Party, that there is a tendency at headquarters to attach mere importance to maintaining the position of comrades working here than to assist the district organisers or help the district party committees to meet their financial obligations.    We can do nothing to destroy such a belief in the minda of those who wish to believe it, but we can assure the district party committees and the district organisers that such a suggestion is far from the truth.     Every comrade employed at headquarters is engaged on some essential party work arising from the normal activities of the Party or that has developed in connection with the new tasks of the Party, and in every case it ia work that could net possibly be done by committees or in the spare time of voluntary workers.     This is a matter upon which the members of the Political Bureau themselves feel very keenly.     There is not a single one of them who would not willingly stand on one aide if better arrangements oould be made:   but if any or all of them stand on one side the work on which they are engaged would still require te be done, and other comrades would have to be found to do it.     The financial obligations would still remain.&quot;In particular reference to the financial position of the distriot party committees and the district organisers, the central Executive Committee ia driven to a recognition of the fact that the present system of district party organisation is far too elaborate for the Party to carry at its present numerical strength and in Its present financial position.    Just as in other aspects we have been compelled considerably to modify the &quot;applleatica   of the new form of party organisation because of the weakness of the party, an also/seems unavoiuable that similar modifications will have te take plaoe in the district party organisations. The numerical strength end finanoes of the Party do not justify the continuance of the district party organisations (acme of which represent a total membership of le33 than 100 and cover only what ia practically one looality) with the services of a full-time district organiser.     It was never regarded by the Central Committee as being oertaln, or in some cases even probable, that the distriot organisers would be full-time paid officials for a long time to come, and until the membership in the particular district justified it.     There are certain distriots where the employment of full-time organisers oould not be justified in any oiroumstanoes other than an unlimited supply of money at headquarters.&quot;Then the present method of financially assisting tho district works out unfairly in that, for example, the district party committee representing the smallest number of members and whose organiser is following his usual employment and therefore receives no payment from the Party, gets the sexsa   weekly allowancefrom/
from headquarters as other district party committees which have much larger membership and muoh greater responsibilities, and have to cover a much wider area.     This has a considerable bearing upon the financial position in regard to the district organisers and the Central Executive -Committee . takes tho view that it woufid be better to withdraw the financial assistance now being given to five of the smaller districts whose work might reasonably be expected to be carried on voluntarily and to inorease to  3 the grant now being medo to the remaining five.    This was the decision made at the meeting of the Central Executive Committee on Sunday last.     The five district . party committees whose weekly allowance from headquarters it i3 proposed to stop arc Liverpool, Edinburgh, Tyneside, Birmingham and Sheffield, and these whem it is proposed should receive tho additional allowance are Glasgow, Manchester, South Wales, London   and Bradford.     It was further decided that this new arrangement should come into operation with the week commencing October  9th.A suggestion made by Pollitt, who receives  5 a week, that the salaries of the Headquarters Staff should be reduced by  1 per week and the money saved added to the grants made to certain District Organisers, was negatived by the Political Bureau on the ground that tho suggestion was not &quot;any real solution of the problem.&quot;Considerable time and thought appear to have beon expended upon the preparation of a special Issue of &quot;speakers Hotes&quot; fcr the Autumn Campaign:   th^se notes are too voluminous for quotation but the headings glvon below Indioate their subject matter:&quot;The&apos; Chairman(a) Local situation:   cencentrate on the coming Munlci$glElections.

Speakers.The following points should he dealt with by the various speakers:-&apos;The Disunity of the labour Movement.Workers1 De3ire to Struggle.The Need for a United Front.The Deaire of the Gommunlst Party to Establish a United Front, The Heed for United Action.The Failure of Capitalism as a System Generally.The Hole of the Communist Party.The Heed for and the Pole of the ^Workers1 Weekly.Appes.l for Members. &quot;International Situation.Review of the International Situation^The Third Congress of ths Communist International . in its review of the International economic and political situation diagnosed the present period as the epoch of the collapse of capitalism and the development of the world revolution.The Fourth Congress re-affirmed the conclusions of the Third.All attempts to restore the equilibrium of 1914 have failed.The Russian Revolution which Is in its sixth year and on the upward grade, strengthening its economic foundations, and equipped with the finest workers1 political fighting machine the world has ever known.Russia Is the centre of the proletarian revolution, building and strengthening the working class forces of the world.It is a fitting oentre for the Communist International, which unites the vanguard of the revolutionary workers of all countries.The Role of the Communist International.In the midst of this chaos it is the task of the Communist International as the one revolutionary organisation of the world struggle of the workers, to invite the working masses of ail countries under ths single leadership directing the workers to the conquest of capitalism-    That is why it appeals to every worker willing to join it3 ranks and offers at everystep/
in/step of the struggle to unite with every working olass organisation national or international in the defenoe of or prosecution of the interests of the workers.&apos;   That is why it ruthlessly exposes every leader within the ranks of the working class movement, who through ignorance or duplicity seeks to lead the workers into the camp of the capitalists.The Role of the British Communist Party is:To carry out in this country the taske the Communist International has before it on a world wide soale.&quot;On October 14th about 1,000 people attended a communistmeeting held in the Battersea Town Hall:   the speakersinoluded Ziloh, Johns, Councillor A. Wall and Tom Bell:Wall said that:&quot;He was highly delighted at the magnificent attendance.     That was the sort of meeting that put the &apos;wind up1 tho authorities.     It was a splendid send off for the winter and a oomplete answer to those wise persons who were always ready to say- that the Communist Party was making no headway in this country.     The powers that be in the Battersea area and especially the Battersea and Wandsworth Guardians would be compelled to alter their tone and their attitude, if the workers would roll up to the meetings like they haa done that night.     Tha Authorities would wonder where it was all leading to.     The fact was that at last the workers wore waking up and realising what the Communist Party had done for them.     The unemployed had realised that already and were swelling the ranks of the Party in great numbers weekly.     This winter was going to be the most serious that the workers of this country had ever experienced, and especially for the unemployed.    All sections of the workers had been beaten to the- ground, in consequence of the way they had been let down by the so-called labour leaders and the heads of the great trade unions.,,The fact was that no solution of the unemployed problem oould be found under the Capitalist System and they of the Communist Party said therefore, that the system must be destroyed.     That was what they were out for,  , It was up to the workers to organise with the one object in view of destroying the Capitalist System and putting the only possible system in its place - Communism like unto that which existed in Russia..^.In every oountry in the world, not even excepting America the   workers were being more ruthlessly crushed by the sapitalists every year and were being forced to live In degradation, destitution and absoluto starvation.     The communists were out to end all that, but they oould only act when the workers were sufficiently organised.     The workers had to be organised to take control of the mines, factories, shipyards, railways and all the means of production, so that production could be use! to supply those who wroked with a sufficiency of everything that the human frame required.     Only by a revolution oould this be brought about and the oommuniats were organising with that end
ft 9in view, and the revolution might oome much sooner than was generally imagined...&quot;Wall appealed to the audience to sign their names on the back of the leaflet &quot;Something Bettor.     Bo you want it?    How to get it&quot;, which is the only one that has so far been issued in connection with the Autumn Campaign: the &quot;something better&quot; in the way of living conditions can, aoooraing to the leaflet, be obtained only by the substitution,if necessary by unconstitutional means, of communism for capitalism.The issue of &quot;The Workers1 Weekly&quot; dated October 12thcontained the municipal programme of the Communist party which provincial organisers have been instructed to use with the addition of any local colour neoessery for theircampaigns:   the programme is as under:&quot;(1) HOUSBJS.- Adequate house room for all houseless and badly housed workers.Pressure on Government to start immediate national scheme of building.Rationing of all housing accommodation.Ho evictions of workers.    Bo decontrol of rents.(8) UNEMPLOYMENT.- Relief for unemployed at full trade-union rates as national charge.Ho &quot;task work.*Unemployed representation In the control of all relief schemes.(3) CHILD WELFARE,- Extension of child welfare.Complete provision for nursing mothers.   Ho &apos;baby starving.1(4) WORKERS1 FACILITIES.- Provisions of halls, parks, libraries and baths for the workers.(5) RATES.- Equalisation of rates between rich and poor areas.     Grouping of areas to use resources of rich residential areas for benefit of poor industrial areas.Ho starvation of vital services for workers. Taxation, not borrowing.&quot; Ellen Wilkinson is contesting a seat on the ManchesterCity/
City Council ana J.T. Walton Newbold has promised to speak on her behalf on October 29th.Tt is.reported that Newboia speaking at a private oomumnist meeting at Coventry on October,3rd dealt with the advisability of selecting &quot;street captains&quot; and groups for demonstrations and other purposes:   these would, he thought, be a step towards the formation of &quot;Eea Guards&apos; Units&quot; - &quot;all helping in the overthrow of the present system and bringing nearer the revolution.&quot;The Chief Constable of Birmingham informs me that a district Party Committee Conference of the CommunistParty was held in that city on Ootober 13th at which the  chairman was John Trotter, end the speakers wereWilliam Gallacher, William T.

RED IHTERHATIQMAL OF LABOUR UNIONS.The following extracts are taken from a letter dated october 4th and sent to Gallacher by the Central ExecutiveBureau of the Red International of Labour Unions:&quot;We have learned with much pleasure of your activity, and are satisfied indeed at the lively activity displayed by the present personnel of the British bureau.    We shall make an exhaustive useof/
of all informations your letter con tains,, and shall do our utmost to get up regular and close connexions with you and the other comrades mentioned in the letter.     Our opinion is that it will he best to effect a weekly exchange of informations on the situation and the activity so that close connexions and a mutual   -service of information may exist between the Central European, british ana latin Bureaus.&quot;One of the grave questions to be solved jointly is the publication of an international Bulletin of industry-groups In English, and its disposal in England and in the Anglo-Saxon countries.     These Bulletins already appear in German, and partly also in French.    The following Bulletins already appear in print:   1. Metal Workers. 2. Miners, 3. Transport Workers, 4. Leather Workers, 5. Chemists,.6. Wood Workers, 7. Building Workers, 8. Textile Workers and 9. Agricultural Workers.    We are preparing Bulletins of teachers, employees, olothing workers, eto0     Some of these Bulletins   have already reached 1, 8 and even 10 number, some of them with an edition of 10,000 copies, the edition increasing from number to number.    As to the international information, our Bulletin gives the very newest and richest material, as our department of information deals with a lot of press editions Of all countries.     We furthermore give reports and special correspondences that we get from the various countries. The first numbers of the Bulletin are send gratuitously, the following agsizast payment, and we hope that a big part of the Bulletin will be based on a sound financial basis.    Thanks to our connexions with) the Latin oountrles, the Bulletins are already beginning to appear in French, chiefly as supplements of our revolutionary organs.    How we are facing important question of     .&apos; issuing the Bulletin in English for England ana the &apos;, Anglo-Saxon countries.    We are practically facing the,1&apos; necessity of issuing the Transport Workers&apos; Bulletin in English, so as to,provide the English and American Seamen stopping at European ports with them.     The Bulletin is now being translated into English, and the first numbers will appear in the next days.    We shall send them to you for your information and for distribution in several copies.     We request you to give us in short your opinion on the contents and the character of the Bulletin.     We think, that the Bulletins of the Miners, Transport Workers and Metal Workers are most important for the Anglo-Saxon countries in view of our movement&apos;a growth, and we request you to let us have your opinion in this matter.     Should you have any technical   diff IcuItJLea, -m sr* ready to have, the. first numbers translated end even printed attfiour place, so as to enable you, to continue the publication after some numbers have been published...&quot;And now a short information on the situation in Germany.     The exterior end interior situation in Germany will be generally known to you...A number of Russian comrades had a discussion with Trade Unionists of here In Germany on the problem of the perspectives of the eoonomioal, and not only Trade Unionists construction of proletarian Germany following the day of revolution..    In the next few days, a most important convention of the revolutionary labour unionists ofFran oe/
France, Germany and of Tohe60-Slovakia is to take place, dealing with the situation In Germany, and with the tasks incumbent upon the proletariat of the adjoining countries.    The Profintern 13 going its utmost to discuss the question of international actions for helping the revolutionary German proletariat as the oentral question on the impending congress of the 0.0.1*11. in Bourges.    The full session of the All-Bttssian Central Committee of the labour unions, that has just taken place, has, according to the report of the R.I.1.U* adopted an important resolution on that question.    In our latest bulletin as well as in those now appearing, we are treating the question of supporting the German revolution as a central problem.    We presume you are sufficiently informed in this matter and have received due instructions from Moscow.    Still, we have not yet heard the voice of the British proletariat in this question, although each resolution and any act on the part of the British workers would be and will be of the greatest important.      We are very well aware of the circumstances you were forced to tndure, and of the political situation in England.    We know all that will not favour an active attitude of the British worker in this question, but that does not exempt us as the bureau of the Brofintem of the obligation of doing our utmost to bring this question home to the British workers as well.&quot;One or two British postmen   have been invited to go to Moscow as delegates to the 8th All-Russian Congress of Post, Telegraph and Telephone Workers which is to be held on October 20th.British delegates have also been invited to attend the 6th Annual All*Russian Congress of paper Workers, which is to take plaoe at Petrograd on November 2Qth.The British Bureau of the Red International of labour Unions is considering the advisability of calling an &quot;emergency conference&quot; in connection with the situation in Germany.     Tom Mann and Queloh are to interview George Hicks, A.A. Purcell and R. Williams in order to discuss whether the conference should be held under &quot;non-Red International of labour Unions auspices&quot; or whether it should be &quot;one of the usual Red international of labour Unions Conferences.&quot;The printers have refused to execute any more orders for the British Bureau until some payment has beenmade/
-11 7mode towards tho reduction of the latter1 s debt.The British Bureau has decided to. support Shinwell1 s proposal for a one day strike in connection with unemployment, not apparently with much hope of its propaganda succeeding, but because any support obtained from trade unions &quot;would certainly put the wind up Eons ay Mao.*wWatklns1 efforts to revive the minority movement in the North Eastern area seems to be obtaining some results and oertain extremists in South Wales have sent in a demand that he should visit that coal-field.    The Lancashire Organiser of the Communist Party is of opinion, after a visit to Accrlngton, that there Is a revival of interest locally and that a working miner should be sent into the area to exploit the situation.The Silvertown branch of the Workers1 Union recently passed a resolution &quot;that this branch defy the Executive Cammittee and affiliate to the Red International of Labour Unionss   the Executive has now informed the branoh that affiliation oannot be paid for from branch funds and that the resolution must en no account be carried out.

Holt,chairman of the movement is to be responsible for thebusiness arrangements.     The circular, which is signed byHolt, Hannington and Haya, states that:&quot;Without th6 paper more than half of our organisational efforts are in effect wasted, due. to the fact that the paper forms a direct link sad contact with tho unemployed worker,     The movement iB in reality   based upon the paper, and no one appreciates better than those of us at Headquarters., the difference the loss of it has made throughout the country,&quot;Numerous meetings have been, he 13 by the unemployed in Lo.oJ.jfi and the provinces and indications of renewed interest in organised propaganda ere fairly general,   The largest meeting in London during the week was at Woolwich, where the audience numbered 500.A meeting held under the auspices of the North Southwark branch of the National Unemployed Workers1Committee/

Y/e, therefore, call upon the Trade Councils, and the Trades ttiioa Congress, in ooa junction with the National Administrative Council of the Unemployed, to set up a national campaign of rStop the Gap for the Workers.1&quot;At the adjourned meeting of the WandsworthGuardians on October 12th the labour members againinterrupted the proceedings by using noisy instruments endware suspended:   some of them were ejected from the BoardRoom by ex-policemen employed by the chairman.     Thesuspended members subsequently addressed a meeting of about100 organised unemployed outside the offices.On October 12th about 20 of the Southwark organised.unemployed took forcible possession of a condemnedmcce-upied tenement in Walworth:   when told by the policethat, if they did not give up the tenement, they would beejected they agreed to leave peaceably.It is reported that a man named   James Johns is responsible for misappropriating about  15 from the funds ofthe Unemployed Workers1 Organization.
