The CommuniBt 2arty is evincing unusual interest in trade union matters:   during the past week tha secretaries of looal groups In ths London area have oomnl&amp;ed and sent to the London District Committee lists of all the secretaries of working class organisations in their area to whom circulars are to be sent.    Industrial &quot;fractions&quot; and &quot;nuclei&quot; are furnishing to Distriot Party Committees reports whioh indicate increasing permeation of trade union branches.The following confidential circular 1b a typical example of the attention paid by the Communist Party to trade union affairs:-&quot;To all nucleus Leaders and active Party members of the N.U.C.W. 11.13.A. and H.A.TJ.L.Dear Comrades, -4&quot;The London Vigilance Committee of the Municipal employees  Association (whioh is the body responsible for &quot;The Municipal Charter&apos; whioh the WORKERS&apos; WEEKLY has been supporting from week to week) is probably circulating London branches of the national union of General Workers, the Municipal employees  Association and the National Amalgamated union of Labour, with a view to arranging a District Joint Rank and file Conference to consider the rules and amendments for the forthcoming amalgamation, t is hoped by this means to stimulate and co-ordinate eft-wing opposition to the rules as proposed,&quot;The fact that the Executive of the M.E.A. has, as a result of the request of several branches, allowed a little extra time for the supply of amendments, shews that united action by branches osn bear results,&quot;This example should be followed in other districts. Rules make it impossible for a Branch or Distriot Committee of the K.U.G.W. to take the initiative in calling such    , a oonference, but members of the other two unions are freer.    Will you do all in your power to get such a Joint rank and file conference called in your distriot by whatever means seem most simple.    Some decisive action is neoessary to put a atop to all the secrecy whioh has characterised this amalgamation.&quot;The Amalgamation Conference is fixed for November 22nd. There does not seem muoh prospect of its being postponed. Any rank and file oonferenoe should be held not later than November lath.    Suggestions for the exact lines whichparty/
B i) 3m   Z   &quot;Party members should adopt at such conferences will be  1 circulated when copies of the amended agenda for the Amalgamation Conference have been received.    Meanwhile the proposed amendments sent out by the Party on October 13th should serve as a guide to the activity of all Party members is this business.&quot;But please get down at onoe to the business of getting Joist rank-and-file conferences held and of 3eourisg support from your branch.&quot;Also will you please send is at onoe to 16 King Street, the names of all Party members and left-wingers who have been nominated or elected for the Amalgamation Conference ?Yours fraternally, HARRY P0DIITI,National Organiser.&quot;A further example of Communist aotivity among unions is provided in a oiroular from which the following extract is taken&quot;5!he Communist Party of Great Britain.&quot;Amalgamated Engineering Union. &apos;.&quot;Elections to District and Divisional Committees. .&quot;It is important that wherever possible Party members should secure election to the Distriot Committees.    No opportunity should now be lost.    In December the District Committees eleot the Divisional Committees, who in turn elect the National Committee.    7/111 you forward at onoe to the Central Industrial Department of the Party the names of Comrades who would be suitable for election to Divisional Committees.&quot;As an instanoe of local, as distinct from national aotivitythe following quotation from a letter written by the secretaryof the Manchester Industrial Committee to another member is notuninteresting;-&quot;Have Just seen the OpenBhaw B.B.C. re next Sunday&apos;a aggregate meeting of A.E.U. members in the openshaw branch of CP.    The time for the above meeting is 12.a.in.    As you are aware we have about  4 A.B.U. members in Openehaw CP. spread over about 10 T.U. Branches.     I should like you to consider wether the nucleus leader in each branch should send his report direct to you or to the suggested local A.E.U. oommittee, who in turn shall collect the reports and forward them to you.&quot;5Phe/

&quot;It is essential, in my judgment, that the British working-class movement should prapare to organise on the lines of a &quot;Ranis Off Germany&quot; movement oomparable With the &quot;Hands Off Russia&quot; movement, which rendered such conspicuous service against; Churchill and his co-interventionists from 1918 to 1920.&quot;Parliament will not meet until the middle of November, and it behoves us, one and all, to make it signally clear to our ultra-tranquil Government that we will not permit the use of our British forces at Cologne to assist the Junkers and militarists against whom this cpuntry waged war from 1914 to 1918.&quot;P.J. Tevenan, general seoretary of the Municipal Employees Association states that his Executive is &quot;fully in sympathy with the communist standpoint&quot;.W. Gallacher and E.T. Whitehead returned from Germany on October 26th and 27th respectively:   both visited various towns in Germany and Gallacher&apos;s account of his activities is not unintere sting: -&quot;Berlin, October 24th.&quot;On Saturday I went to look for the friends with whom I had to do business.     Alas they were gone.     Gone to Dresden.     I got the mid-day train and followed up. I got to Dresden Saturday evening.     When I got there I found that I was late again, they had gone on to Chemnitz. ..&quot;I went to Chemnitz Sunday morning and attended the conference of the Ge^erkschaft (Workers&quot; Council) which had been verboten by the Military Dictator.&quot;It was a crowded conference and three of the saxon Cabinet Ministers addressed it.     One social Democrat and two Communists.     In the afternoon there was a parade of the HundBartschafts, which the Saxon Government had been ordered to disband.     Nothing happened tho&apos; we cannot say when there will ba an outbreak.&quot;The   Workers&apos; International Russian Relief has issued an appeal for money and food, to relievo &quot;ttie terrible famine oatastrophe&quot; which has broken out in Germany:   national committees have been instructed to send contributions to the Zlirioh office.The Communist Party is experiencing an acute financial crisis, the nature of which is best illustrated in the extracts from correspondence quoted below:-Ball/

On Friday there will be    drastic cuts made that might put Mac, myself, Jaokson, Pollitt and sundry others on the outside.     There is talk of getting us fixed in the way others have trod to enable us to still be here. That, however, does not, enamour me as it only means . additional work, for the same screw.&quot;Pollitt to Park    October 26th.&quot;At the moment we are overwhelmed by a particularly acute crisis here at the centre which is making it practically impossible for us to be carrying on ordinary activities.&quot;Pollitt to Jackson    October 24th.&quot;You won*t have to go, unless we all have to go. I am absolutely convinced as a result of ray four rounf that we have to keep a full time Propagandist, and thou art the man.     The only difficulty is one that concerns us all, and you will not have to go unless the lot of us go.&quot;Harry1 Pollitt, who is reported to have been nominated as Parliamentary candidate for Paieley, is said to have given the looal Labour Party an assurance that he will aooept the Labour Party constitution.     Pollitt intends, if possible, to procure employment in a ship-yard in the near future, as the Boilermakers are taking nominations for the Trades Union Congress and the labour Party Congress next month and he would not otherwise be eligible for election. MD international JO NAD OF LABOUR UNIONS.Numerous documents regarding the situation in Germany arestill being sent to the British Bureau of the Red Internationalof labour Unions:   most of these cover familiar ground, butmention may be made of &quot;appeals&quot; from:I.     &quot;fha International Propaganda Committee of the Revolutionary Transport Workers&quot;.2.     &quot;The Conference of Railwaymen of the Moscow district,&quot;The first of these documents contains the followingpassages;&quot;COMRADES.1 WHEN YOUR LEADERS FALL, THEN MUST WE   .

Already, this work has been aooomplished in a number of aietriotB in Germany, Franoe and Czecho-Slovakia.&quot;In all important ports, railroad Junctions, frontier stations and large production points there should be immediately formed WORKERS&apos; BODIES ID CONTROL AND PRE &quot;VENT TEE TRANSPORT OF TROOPS AND WAR MATERIAL.     These various control points must be connected up with each other, Isolated action is useless.&quot;Endeavour to draw the munitions workers and the soldiers into your campaign.&quot;Transport workersl   You hold the key positions in this crisis.   To help to aid in transporting troops and munitions for the slaughter of your German class brothers is far worse than strike breaking.

olaims to have had &quot;a fairly good response&quot;to the oircularaon the German situation issued to the Executive Councils ofthe different unions:   this claim is scarcely tome out bythe evidence so far available.The Chief Constable of Cardiff informs me that at least100 delegates, 80$ of whom ware miners&apos; agents and oheckweighers,attended tho south Wales Miners1 Minority Movement conferenceheld in Cardiff on October 27th.    Arthur I. Horner wa3 in theohair and W.H. Mainwaring of the Central labour College wasalso present:   among the conveners of the conference were:Swilym Richards (Hirwain), A.J. Cook (Porth), Councillor GeorgeDolling (Ynyshir), and I. Thomas (Ynyshir).    According to theofficial report issued:-&quot;It was unanimously resolved to demand the immediate calling of a special conference of the South Wales coal-field, in view of the reduction of wages below the living standard, with the object of deciding to give 14 days&apos; notice to terminate contracts, to fight for a living wage and a new agreement.&quot;It was deoided that the principles of the new        ,**&apos; agreement should be based not on profit sharing but on the cost of living, using for the time being 1914 wages as a standard, plus the present increase in the cost of living; future wages to be regulated by the rise and fall in the oost of living.&quot;In view of the reductions taking place in practically every other coalfield it was deoided to get in touch with these districts to urge them to take similar action.&quot;It was unanimously deoided that no future agreements containing profit-sharing clauses whereby wages oould o^nly be secured as long as profits to the owners were Becured, be entered into between tho miners and the. coalowners.&quot;That the same conference called to deal with the wages question shall also deal with the Compensation Bill, which will oome before the House of Commons when it next meets; and to take drastic action to force amendments on the lines of the Holman Gregory Report.    Aooidents were on the increase in the coalfield, and there has been a large increase in the number of oases of nystagmus and in some oases these sufferers are only paid the half difference and are refused light work.German/
seeGerman Miners&apos; Working Day.&quot;The conference viewed with serious alarm  the lengthening of the working day of the German miners, realising that this is bound to react on the British miner, and! thus endanger their present seven hours&apos; day.    The M.F.G.B. should be urged to call a Irade Union Congress.&quot;In view of the alarming situation now prevalent in Germany and Its consequent eoonomio effect upon the miners of South Wales in particular, we urge all lodges to pass: the following resolution;-&quot;Thie conference pledges itself to export the German miners in their struggles with international oapitallBm, and resolves to do all in its power tofenerate working class support by action in their oflges with a view to the immediate withdrawal of British troops.   It demands a conference of the South Wales coalfield in order to discuss the effects of British capitalist interference in the Buhr on British miners, and south Wales miners in particular^&apos;&quot;This conference pledges itself to support the unemployed in their demand for work or full maintenance and expresses its readiness to support a proposal for a 24 hours&apos; general strike when such proposals comes before the offioial organisation for consideration.&quot;TOUgg COMMUNIST LEAGUEThe Communist Party has felt called upon   to exercise itsparental authority over the Young Communist league and toohastise it for &quot;intimating its decision&quot; to change the printersof &quot;The Young Worker&quot;;     tie League considered that the &quot;priceservice and make-up&quot; of the paper, as produced by the communist .&quot;Centropress&quot;, afforded ground for complaint, but has beeninformed that the Organising Bureau of the adult party expeotsthe decision to be resoinded.It is reported that the literature treasurer of the YoungCoamunist League &quot;has decamped with tho entire funds&quot;.iNSfflLOYJD.The secret report of the conference of the National ^ministrative Council of the National Union of Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement which was held in London from September 29th - October 2nd inclusive, has oome into my Possession and discloses both dissension among and lack ofpolicy/
policy on the part of the leadere of the movement.    Among those present wore the officials Hannington, Huye, Holt and Homer, the members of the National Administrative Counoil, Lovell of the Rational Sub-committee, Straker (London), Campbell (V-ale of Leven), and H.E. Newbold (Barrow).Most of the time was devoted to the discussion of the rupture with Soderberg, the expenses of offioials, the financial muddle for which Honor was responsible and tho publication of the paper.    The more interesting portions of the minutes are as under:-SUDIiBHtG AND Tfa&amp; UMEMFbOySID WORKERS-&apos; ORGANISATION.&quot;Through the summer months the apparently inevitable apathy had sat in.    Despite this the Movement, both in Scotland and London had remained intact, although in ths latter cause it was not the fault of some individuals,     In London there had;been a great deal of trouble with soderberg, the late London Organiser, who had done his best to break: up the London Movement through repeated attacks upon Headquarters. These attacks ware delivered at the London District Council&apos; and also at outdoor meetings.     The result being that he finally succeeded in breeding a spirit of disloyalty through-out the London Movement.&quot;Since he had gone other individuals had carried on with the agitation against Headquarters, with a consequence that those at tho office had had to expend their energies to counteract these efforts with a consequent lack of attention to essentials.&quot;&quot;With reference to the paper they would all bo aware of the debt of over  200 owing to the printer and of the present position.    Despite efforts to increase the circulation it had gradually dropped until we had reached the present stage without a paper.&quot;BUSINESS MANAGER&apos;S REPORT.&quot;He took over office about April 24th/23 and had found much needed doing, the Press Department having to be installed with some expense.     He found that the paper would need, a circulation of 25,000 to 30,000 to make it a success. Several circulars had been sent out urging Committees to take up the paper.     About 20 fresh occmittses had responded, but the sales went.down due to other committees ceasing to have supplies.   - He then had circularised about 1,500 T.U. Branches, but had obtained very few orders.&quot;He has perhaps allowed Committees- more scope than he should have done in allowing them credit.     The Movement had also deolined and the circulation went with it.     As a resultof/
of the whole position becoming worse the paper had finally: to be dropped. ;t &apos;&quot;The Press Committee had met at intervals, but therej had been difficulties due to the visits he had to pay to V the Guardians.    The name of the paper had been changed and he thought now th%t this had adversely affected the sales;, there having been many complaints from the oomtaittoes also the I.D.C. on this point.    The size of thepaper had finally been reduced, but even then the price charged by the printer dia not permit of a profit being made.&quot;AUDITORS&apos; REPORT.&quot;A statement, purporting to show the Reoeipts and Payments in connection with the Paper for the same period, was presented to us, but his statement was incomplete on the face of it, and very little information can be obtained from the books of account of this Department, except by the expenditure of a fairly extensive amount of work.    We regret we cannot conduct an audit of this section of the accounts until the same are presented to us in a more complete form.&quot;DISCUSSION Oil FUTURE OP NATIONAL ORGAN.&quot;The Chairman explained that on the instruction of the Sub-Committee the Organiser, Secretary and himself had been on a deputation to the Southwurk Press. The deputation ;&quot; had used all possible arguments to induce the printers to print the paper again. The Directors informed the deputation that they would consider the position and advise the Secretary in due oouroe.&quot;Their reply was now to hand and contained two definite conditions, i.e. 1. Cash to be paid on delivery of papers, with a certain amount off the debt owing.   2. That all future dealings shall be with the Secretary.&quot;Homer asked if the printers had had it explained to them that the H.A.C. had subsidised the paper in the past.&quot;Hannington replied &apos;Yes&apos; and elaborated upon the proceedings at the meeting with the Southwark Press.&quot;Campbell stated that he didn&apos;t see any use in attempting to publish a paper if it couldn&apos;t&apos;t be made to pay.    He asked -for the Secretary&apos;s opinion.&quot;The Secretary said that according to the discussion with the printer he would revise the estimate and further he was not pressing for the payment of the debt at present. Ihe printer certainly wanted to print again as they were losing by not doing so.     He (the secretary) would rather view things from an optimistic standpoint.    He for one was determined if it was at all possible, to get the payer published again.     The Movement was based upon the paper and without it they were at a great loss.     To think in terms of a successful National Movement without its paper was not possible, that is if the Movement was to be really successful.&quot;In answer to a question Homer stated that he thought
a weekly paper v/as necessary to ensure success, providing the estimate was satisfactory.     love&apos;11 thought that a start should he made with a fortnightly.&quot;The Chairman pointed out that this question was already settled hy the Coventry Conference, and that our task was to make it a weekly as soou as we possibly can.&quot;Arising.   Moved Campbell and Newbold.   &apos;That the Secretary be instructed to circularise the Committees urging them to send along orders for the paper.&apos;   Agreed. It was also agreed that special circulars be drawn up for circularising various working class bodies such as Trades Councils and Socialist Parties.&quot;IAMB OF PAPER.&quot;The Chairman gave explanations as to reasons why change of name had already taken place and the methods adopted to obtain seme.&quot;Discussion followed and arising it was moved Strakerand Campbell.   that the name of the paper shall be &quot;The Unemployed Worker1&apos;.&apos;   Agreed.&quot;On policy there was nothing to be said if. it continued along the seme lines as in the past.&quot;EDITOR.&quot;The Chairman explained as to the past Editors.    Homer agreed with the Chairman as to the late Editor being unsuitable despite his capabilities in publishing a paper and suggested that if the H.A.C. desired to a*k Mm to start again, they should lay down certain conditions as to bis behaviour.     After further discussion it was agreed to ask Tom Quelch of 2AH Power&quot; to take on Editorship and that as an alternative, Arthur Siffleet should be approached.MgMlSE.R&apos;.S REPORT.&quot;Immediately after the Coventry Conference he had received an invitation to visit Sussia.     He had exported toreturn, in about six weeks, instead of which it had been about four months.

A monthly delegates&apos; meeting was held last week at which some 30 delegates gave reports which were, in the main, &quot;very favourable&quot;;   the Scottish Workers&apos; Republican&apos; Party is now affiliated to the&apos; College. H BETOTOOMRY ACTIVITIES III &apos; GREAT BRITAIN.In Irish Self-Determination League circles the event of the week was a meeting to commemorate the death of Terence McSwiney, held at the Battersea Town Hall on Sunday, October 20th:   although widely advertised the meeting was a distinct failure from the point of view of numbers, only 200, mostly women and girls, attended as compared1 with 1,100 last year.     Fowler, the Acting President, Irish Self-Datermination League, and. Saklatvala, M.P. for Battersea, were the principal speakers:   Miss Mary McSwiney was billed to speak but did not appear.     There was nothing remarkable in the speeches:   a letter from Mrs. Erskine Guilders was read calling upon the Irish Self-Determination League to organise a monster demonstration either in Hyde Park or Trafalgar Spare &quot;to protest against the illegal detention of Irish prisoners in English gaols&quot;.A determined effort Is to be made to raise money for the Irish Prisoners&apos; Dependents&apos; Fund and for this purpose concerts, dances, -eto. are being arranged.     A Miss Mary Walshe has arrived from Ireland wish a letter from Mrs. 0&apos;Callaghan of Limerick in which the position of many of the dependents is described as desperate, those in charge of the arrangements are not very hopeful and expect very uphill work.Art 0&apos;Brien&apos;B office at No. 3 Adam Street, Adelphi, has had to close its doors owing to the &quot;vindictive persecution &quot; of $hat ^dividual by the British Government:   this office 1ms been used as/
as Republican Head quarters, hero since 1918 and was carried on by * 2), purton after O^rien^ imprisonment.Generally speaking the better class Irish here regard the outlook at home as Jmproving although conditions are still very grave.    Larkin is spoken of as boing no longer a force in the labour movement and his recent alliance with extreme Republicanism is regarded as an admission of defeat.The hunger strike looks like collapsing, in spite of Mary Hc?)Vriney&apos;s &quot;Death or Freedom&quot; cry End it is believed that the yroe statela position will be greatly strengthened thereby:   on the other hand there is a good deal of wild talk about a renewal of civil war if tho prisoners are not released before Christmas, mi most people expect something in the nature of reprisals against Free gtcnte Ministers.The Noel lem&amp;ss ease is spoken of as being likely to do the Free State Government much harm and the disbandment of the Oriel House G.I.D. is welcomed as a move in the right direction:   Oriel Eouso was regarded as a nest of ox-Sinn Fein gunmen, who were given jobs as a reward for their services in pre-Treaty days, but oould not forget their old tricks.Tho Irish Republican Army in this country still appears to be thoroughly disorganised in spite of much talked of re-organisation. There seems to be an absolute lack of control from Headquarters in Ireland and the local leaders aro fighting among themselves, liken, the Chief of Staff, has not tho brains of hie predecessor, Mam lynch.Sinn Fein Clubs in the Glasgow area are showing more signs of activity:   meetings of protest with regard to the prisoners ere b&amp;ing arranged and efforts will bo made to raise money for *heir dependents.
