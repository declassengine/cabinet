Papers Nos. 439-B, 446-B, 448-B, 450-Bl, 453-B and 454-B), prepared by the Secretary of State for War, the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Naval Staff and the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee have been circulated to the Cabinet.These papers were discussed by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 176th Meeting, held on October 2nd, 1923, when the Conclusions set forth below were reached.I now circulate these conclusions for the consideration of my colleagues.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. October 8, 1923.Conclusions.The Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinet (i.) That from the point of view of Imperial Defence the vital requirement is the security of the Suez Canal. It is also of great strategical importance to maintain our aerial establishments in Egypt, particularly those at Heliopolis (near Cairo) and Aboukir (near Alexandria), which constitute the air supply centre for the whole of the Middle East. The radio-telegraphic station at Abuzabel, near Cairo, is also of strategical importance.(ii.) From the military point of view it is essential to maintain a military force (a) within striking distance of Cairo, in order to secure the Suez Canal, to protect the sweet water canal, the wireless station at Abuzabel and the aerodrome at Heliopolis, and (b) within striking distance of Alexandria in order to provide for the security of the Air Force Establishments at Aboukir.(hi.) The maintenance of troops at Cairo itself and at i^ftexandria, though desirable, is not essential from a military point of view, and would be extremely difficult to secure, (iv.) Having regard to the military considerations on the one hand, and to the difficult diplomatic situation on the other, the best course will be, in any negotiations that take place with the Egyptian Government to maintain British Military Forces at Abbasia, near Cairo, and at Mustapha Barracks, near Alexandria, and in return to relinquish the Barracks actually situated in those cities.(v.) The question of the size and eventual location of the garrison and Air nForce is reserved for further consideration.   The/War TSSea and Air&quot;^*^F^^,discuss their proposals   m      &apos;will examine the question in concert, and discuss their proposals with the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, with a view to submitting them to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.[10685]
