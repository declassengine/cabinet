The Committee are glad to report that ths War Office, ,after a -consideration.of the whole position,, have found it possible to accelerate works to the value of  450,000 and that tho Admiralty have been able to increaao ths acceleration undertaken by them to an amount of  856,000*    It Is however rogrettod that only part- of the Admiralty work can bo placed in Barrow-in-Furness, where, as has previously been reported, unemployment stands at a very &quot; high figure and the pros poets of a real recovery are remote.2.,     Considerable progress has been made in dealing with applications for assistance made by local authorities to the Unemployment Grants Committee,    Applications for grants in respect of works amounting to a total value of  24,000,000 have been received and the Committee recommend that tho Unemployment Grants Committee should be authorised to assist schemes up to a total value of  20,000,000 in lieu of the  10,000,000 already approved.. A press notice of the conditions upon which grants may be made to public utility companies has been issued.    At present the Committee do not recommend the fixing of a limit up to which schemes of this kind will be assisted.
o p,r&apos;)3l    fhe coraitdtt.ee have received from the Ministry of Transport an extensive programme for road and bridge work (including the construction Of the Edinburgh-Glasgow road), The committee have given careful consideration to the terms on which assistance from the Road Fund should be given to these works and the extent to which the charges should be borne by the local authorities concerned,4*    They recommend that road work3 amounting to  3,000,000 In counties adjoining London be carried out by the London County Council with a contribution of 75$ of the total cost from the Road Fund;   that the contribution of the Road Fund to the Glasgow-Edinburgh road scheme, (total cost  2,000,000) which lies almost entirely outside the boundaries of the two cities, should also be 75fi;   and that the con-tributions from the Road Fund to other road schemes should not,with-out Treasury sanctions exceed 60$, or 50%, according as the road is without, or within, the boundaries of the. authority constructing it.      Excluding the two schemes above specified road works costing a total sum of  4,000,000 are contemplated5,    As regards bridges, the Committee recommend that a contribution from the Road Fund not exceeding 75$ be made in respect of the queensferry Bridge, Flintshire,(roughly estimated   to cost  150^000) and a Berwick Bridge across the Tweed   (roughly estimated to cost  200,000) and that the contri-butions towards the re-construction of other bridges whether of iron or steel or of ferro-concrete, be a sum not exceeding 65$&quot; of the cost unless special sanction Is obtained from the Treasury.Bridge works costing a total sum of  2,500,000 are contemplated,- r6&apos;    The lCommittee recommend that the Road Fund be authorised to expend a total sum of  8,000,000 in respect of the works described in paragraph (4) and (5) above,     The question-&quot;nether &amp; further recommendation should be submitted in regard ^ the construction of the Liverpool-Manchester Road has been
deferred pending a settlement of questions arising as ,to the Northern and Western Motorway,7,    The Committee have further had under consideration proposals for the reconstruction of the Menai Suspension Bridge,    This Bridge wee built at the National cost and its Mintenance has been a National liability though the tolls upon the Bridge have ordinarily produced an income in excess of the expenditure required.   An entire reconstruction of this Bridge will be necessary in six or seven years and the Committee recommend that the reconstruction of the Bridge should now be undertaken by the Ministry of Transport at the cost of the Road Fund, with a contribution of  50,000 from the Exchequer, the balanoe of the cost except in so far as it may be met by contributions from local authorities to be met from the Road Fund,    The coat of reconstruction is estimated at  250,000.     It should, however, be a condition of the reconstruction of the Bridge that the new Bridge should be freed from tolls and be maintained by the County Councils of Anglesey and Carnarvon.8,     The Committee hope to present at an early date a further report dealing with inter alia the possibilities of increasing employment by the anticipation of programmes of Colonial Development,L.
