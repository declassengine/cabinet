mm COMMUNISTSAccording to a confidential statement recently made by the national secretary of the Communist Party, &quot;the present financial position of the Party is such as to cause us very great concern .   It will be impossible for us to carry on up to the end of the year unless the moat radical economies are effected.&quot;The London organiser states that:&quot;The District Party Committee is bankrupt, and unless we can raise at least   5 within the next week or so we shall have the brokers in,&quot;The fact is that the normal income of the district, can with an effort be made to meet the ordinary expenses, but for tilings like Rent and extras, wo depenfl upon inoora from socials.    The season for those is only just started, but our Landlord and other creditors are pressing us. immediately.The Propaganda Department of the Comaunist Party has issued a third bulletin dated September 28th:   this deals with the situation in Germany and is a continuation of the bulletin quoted in last week&apos;s report.104al Distribution Coniaitte.es have been informed that headquarters intend to issue the four following propaganda leaflets in connection with the Autumn campaign:&quot;1.    A simple statement suitable for workers unfamiliar with any kind of communist literature.2.    A leaflet suitable for Trade Union Branches and labour Parties.

On September 30th 3. saklatvala, 1I.F., addressed an audience of the same size at the Batterwa Town Hall under the auspices of the local labour Party:   be dealt with his recent visits to Denmark, Germany and Russia.    He eulogised the last named country and appealed for unity between the Labour party and the Communist Party.Henry Sara, who has eccepted an engagement to visit Manchester from October 28th to November 4th, has informed the District Party Committee that his terms are  6, hospitality and hie fare.THE RED INTERNATIONAL Off LABOUR unions is a document which haB recently cone into my possession proveb conclusively that the Red International of labour Unions movement in this oountry is still subsidised by the Moscow Executive:    the connection between the Soviet Government and the International having been established, this document, which is quoted below, would appear to constitute a breach of the undertaking recently given by the Soviet Government &quot;not to support with funds or in any form persons or bodies or agencies or institutions whose aim it is to spread discontent or to foment rebellion in any part of the British Empire.&quot;&quot;Moscow/
&quot;Moscow, August 24,1923.&quot;British Bureau of the R.I.L.U. London.&quot;Dear Comrades,&quot;On the 22nd of this month we wrote you in reply to your letters of August 2nd ana 4th, with special reference to your general activities.   We also sent you enolosed in that letter, an extracts from the Minutes of the Executive Bureau meeting of July loth, 1923, giving definite directions as to the methods of work in Great Bri tain.&quot;Herein we shall deal with the various small practical questions raised in your letters of August 2nd and 4th.&quot;1.   TOM MASK.    Being an old and experienced fighter on the labour front, and Chairman of the British Bureau of the R.I.L.U., Tom Mann deserves adequate pay for his services.    Our funds are, unfortunately, extremely limited, and we are not in a position to pay him a large salary.    However, he is to aontinue to receive  85 par month from the Bureau.   This expenditure should be considered as a permanent one, and should be included In your regular reports, showing when and how Comrade Tom Mann reoeives his salary.&quot;2,   COMRADE GALLAGHER, as the responsible head of the British Bureau, should devote all of his energies to the work in the Bureau, from which he is to receive s corresponding fee.   We propose that the Bureau pay Comrade Gallacher a regular monthly salary of  25.   This expenditure is also to be considered permanent, since Comrade Gallacher was appointed responsible head of the British Bureau by the Exeoutive Bureau of the R.I.L.0&quot;. All other expenses incurred by Comrade aallaaher in the discharge of his duties, such as travel expenses, etc, should be paid out of the treasury of the British Bureau.&quot;3.   COMRADE WATKINS is an employe of the British Bureau, and is entirely at its disposal.    The Bxeoutive Bureau of the R.I.L.I7. does not wish to interfere with his private affairs.   However, inasmuch as Comrade watkina, being an official representative of the R.I.L.U., scandalised himself by acts which caused him to*ba brought before the courts, we cannot but express our regret that the members of the Exeoutive Coamittea of the British Communist Party did not take the proper steps to prevent the R.I.L.U&quot;. from being discredited in the eyee of the British workers by Comrade Catkins,   we hope that in the future you will Bee to it that no such situation ariBes in the oase of any other responsible member of the British Bureau.   The salary rsoeived by Comrade Wattcins is a matter entirely of your own.   Please advise us by return mail how you have settled the question of watkin*s salary and what work he is carrying on among the British workers.&quot;4.   RS COMRADE QUELCH AHD OTHER WORKERS:   as long as you have engaged Thomas Queloh and other comrades for responsible work in the British Bureau, you are yourselvesto/
to fleoide whether end how their work is to be paid. What we are chiefly interested in, is that the work of agitation and propaganda should be at a proper height, irrespective of the insignificant expenditure which might be required for the upkeep of responsible workers in this field.    We repeat, the I.P.C. Bulletins must be published at all cost.&quot;5.   FINANCIAL KEP0R2S.     The above expenses are to be covered from the available funds of the Bureau.,   Do not fail to senfl in, monthly reports of the&apos;expenditures made by you according to the forms submitted to&apos;you.   Also aSvi.se us of the steps taken by you to make the British Bureau self-supporting thru funds collected among the workers of Great Britain.&quot;Please submit before us a detailed estimate of the funds required to carry out satisfactorily printed agitation and propaganda among the transport workers, metal workers and miners.   We have in mind the publication of the above mentioned bulletins, appealB, and subsidies!to our existing press.   Do not fail to send in this estimate by the next mail.&quot;6,   INFORMATION.     In our last letter wementioned the fact that the information received from the British Bureau is inadequate.   We have also requastud exhaustive information on the important questions of the British labour movement.     We wish to report thin again, and xmintii you of the necessity of receiving; regular exhaustive information from the British Bureau, describing &quot;its activities and the most important events of the labour movement in Great Britain and its colonies.&quot;We are particularly interested in all possible information on your tactics in the movement of the clock workers, in the 1 oak -out of the ship bollermakers, in tho lock-out cf the pottery workers, in the lock-out of the moulders.in the light- steel industry and in the movement of the railway shopmen:;, miners, chemical ivorkers and all transport workers.&quot;7.   Comrade Stowart informed us that Comrade Pollitt is publishing a special paper for the dock workers.   We regret to state that wa have never deceived a copy of this paper.   We have also none of the most important publication of the British communist party and Labour Party.     we urgent?.;&apos; request that you send us by return mail all the latest publications of the revolutionary press of Great Britain.Fraternally yours,ACTING GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE R.X.L.U.Max Siese, Berlin, N.0.43, Am Prenzlauerberg 8,&quot;(N.B.   -   The minuteB of the Executive Bureau meetingon/w*8 Addresee) j*J Adaresse) r Address      )
on July 10th, 1923, of which mention is made in the first paragraph of the above letter dealt with Moscow&apos;s decisions regarding the personnel and work of the British Bureau of the Red international of labour Unions and were quoted on pages 7 and 8 of Report No. 221).The International Propaganda Committee of Educational Workers has instructed the British Bureau of the Red International of labour Unions to send a delegate to a conference of revolutionary teachers which is to be held in Berlin a few days prior to the conference of teachers&apos; organisations which is to be held by the Amsterdam International of Trade Unions in Brussels in November. The International Propaganda committee &quot;urges that all the revolutionary teachers&apos; organisations should take part in the conference (at Brussels) and try to influence its decisions.&quot;On September 28th the London Propaganda Counoil of the Red International of Labour Unions held a combined meeting and social evening at the Victoria Hotel, Parringflon Street:   this was one of a series of such gatherings whioh are to be held monthly.   About 55 men and 7 women were present and are said to have been &quot;the pick of the various revolutionary movements in London&quot;;   among them were Tom Manri, W. Hannington, W. Gallacher, Tom Queloh, Prank Smith, E.W. Cant, P. Haye, Tom Walsh. Ellen Wilkinson, J.R. Campbell and a Dane named prandaen.    The speakers dealt with the necessity of obtaining control of Trades Councils, particularly in London:   a committee of three was appointed to examine the question and report to the next monthly meeting.     Most of the people present drank heavily and many left the hall &quot;far from sober&quot;.The Chief Constable of Coatbridge has sent me a copy of the &quot;Special Airdrle and Coatbridge supplement&quot; of&quot;The /
&quot;The Worker&quot;, Sated September 22nfl, 1928:   this was asingle sheet containing one long article dealing with unemployment and entitled &quot;The Fourth Winter of Hell andthe Way Out,&quot; a programme for the unemployed, communistadvertisements and a cartoon.   The sales of the supplementtotalled 1,436 in Coatbridge and Airdrie and during thesame week 383 oopies of &quot;The workers&apos; Weekly&quot; were sold.William Gallacher&apos;e own account of his daily work isnot without interest:&quot;I start off in the morning at the R.I.L.U. where I attend to letters and prepare reports. There&quot;s quite a lot to be done there I can assure you.&quot;In the afternoon there Is a meeting round here at King Street every afternoon.   For the bo meetings I have to prepare quite a lot of material.    Then in the evenings I have public meetings or meetings of party members.&quot;Then on the top of all this I have to Interview all sorts of people and try to get them interested in the work on hand.    There&apos;s a big drive being mads to rouse the workers in the Trade Union Movement.   There&apos;s got to be a thorough overhauling of the movement or there will be a opmplete collapse...&quot;m UNEMPLOYEDE. Shinwell, M.P., has contributed an article onunemployment to the issue of &quot;The New Leader&quot; dated September28th in the course of which ha urges that:&quot;Wherever the unemployed are organised, the Trades Councils should immediately admit them to membership.   We cannot stand on ceremony;   the man outside the factory must be brought into oon*act with the man Inside.   Maybe certain Trade Unions will objeot to the preBenoe on a Trades Council of unemployed organisations not officially connected with the Trade Union movement.   Objections of this character must be firmly suppressed.   Where there are no unemployed organisations the Trades Councils ought to maintain touch with the men at the Labour Exchanges by means of meetings and the constant distribution of literature.&quot;Moreover, we must organise a great nationalgesture/
gesture of protest.   Every Trade Union branch, every Trades Council- for that matter, every Trade Unionist---must bring pressure to bear on the national movement to &amp; solare a day of idleness on the day before tef&quot;cpe.5ing ^Tiamo^T   On thai flay the executives of the&quot; Li&quot;hour&quot;party, &quot;the Trades Congress, the parliamentary Party ir.d representatives of the unemployed movement must wai b in depubation on the Government.     Our demands should be presented, while in every industrial centre the organised movement demonstrates its unity cn this great national issue. The local movements must arrange deputations to the local authorities urging the provision of work and . calling on them to force the hands of the Government. It may-be urged that to the call for a one-day stoppage there would be at most a half-hearted response,.   This depends on the enthusiasm with which the project is received by the leading spirits of our movement.   It can be done if they will it.   If it fails, it would appear that the people prefer to suffer;   in which case the responsibility is not ours.&quot;A National protest&quot;A national demonstration of protest may not solve the problem, but no solution is possible until the oonscience of the nation has been aroused.&quot;Who will take the first step?   Why not the Independent Labour Party?&quot;In connection with the above artlele K. Palme Duttwrote, to Hannington:&quot;You have probably seen Shinwell&apos;B oall for a one-day strike re unemployment (in this week&apos;s !New Leader&apos;).     He proposes the day before Parliament meets;   Gallacher suggests that if you can give us a short open letter to Shinwell welcoming his repetition of the unampi.jyed &apos;s demand, but pointing out why the day Parliament meets would be best for such a strike, it would help to bring such action nearer.&quot;The General Counoil of the Trade Union Congress hasdecided to set up a joint advisory committee representingthe Council and the National unemployed workers&quot;1 Committee Movement.A special meeting of officials of London ConmitteeB ofthe National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement he In.on September SOth passed a resolution that:&quot;The Branches get up Demonstrations of women and children to the Boards of Guardians, to demand clothes and boots.&quot;The/
The National Unemployed workers&apos; Committee Movement is perturbed at the progress made by the Unemployed Workers&apos; Organisation and reoently held a meeting to discuss means of combatting that organisation:   owing, however, to laok of funds no definite decision was reached but the Communist Party and the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions are to devote special attention to obtaining control of the unemployed.Sylvia pankhurst is still exporting the unemployed workers&apos; Organisation and although her remarks are usuallybombastic to a degree, it is perhaps worthy of note thatshe said to a correspondent recently, in reference to this organisation, that:&quot;They will become an organisation that will be alive and under the direotion of the Communist Workers&apos; Party, and will not aooept things as the National Unemployed do.   We will give them the lead and you oan rest assured they will follow.   We will adopt the same tactics as the Suffragette Movement did and we have men this time that are oapable of hitting as hard as they are hit, Hannington and the Communist party are dead and here we have unemployed doing nothing and waiting for a lead.    We do intend to be militant but as to disturbances now and again, no.   We will be a continual disturbance, moving everywhere in every district.   If we are hit we will hit back.   If they imprison us we will hunger-strike.   We might aB well be hungry inside there as to be outside ana hungry.&quot;A deputation of 12 members of the Unemployed workers&apos;Organisation attended a meeting of the poplar borough council on September 27th to protest against the allegedpreferential treatment given to certain Council employesand more particularly to ex-police strikers:   the Mayor,John Scurr, supported by the Council, refused to hear thedeputation whioh thereupon withdrew.KffiBS LBAGCTIIn view of the statement that Moscow is now subsidising the Plebs League, interest attaches to thefollowing/
Illfollowing statement of League policy which was drawn up last week.&quot;To refrain from direct party propaganda or advocacy of the Communist Party but to keep all lectures etc. related to the class struggle.&quot;To combat any existing anti-political tendencies and to emphasize the practical application of our teaching in the functions and work of a true workers party.&quot;To educate the workers on the need for concerted political organisation and cent railBed direction of the olass struggle and to assist&apos;in eoucaiTng CP. members in the Plebs league or N.C.L.C. classes to assume that direotion.&quot;To avoid discussion of advanced details in philosophy and economics and to concentrate on modern application of theories.     In history teaching to raise the level of accuracy and to eliminate obsolete text books (Korr and others).   To deal with modern problems and :draw a moral&apos; from the day to day struggle of the workers.&quot;To try and emphasise the following theoretical points:-1.     Imperialism is due to capitallst/nonopolies and their power over the state.   The important form of the modern orisis is the political (Imperialist) orisis,2.    The objective of the working class struggle is seizure of state power.   This is the meaning of the political struggle.3,    The sectional struggle is not any good unless it is integrated and combined with the conception of the political struggle.4.    To organise the political struggle and.to integrate its various facets, a disciplined and organised and centralised workers party is necessary.5o    The political movement must not be allowed to disintegrate into its various sectional aspects*.*industrials parllamenterj&apos;, educational, eter.    Activity in the political struggle must.be combined with any specialised work,&quot;OPIYICTIOHSThe Chief Constable of Birmingham informs me that on September 25th the communist Arthur Edward swain was sentenced to 6 months&apos; imprisonment without hard labour for/
10 -112for inciting po*son8 to assault police officers and members of the Board of Guardians.On September 27th a labourer named George Jones was sentenced at Thames police Court to 4 weeks&apos; imprisonment without hard labour for assaulting an inspeotor of police during the disturbance at Poplar on September 26th.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINAn effort is being made to save the machinery of theold Irish Self-Determination League:   Art 0&apos;Brien hasurged tho faithful few to keep the Head Office going untilha comes out of prison and an appeal has been issued to the few branches that are left for financial aid:   a smallweekly levy is suggested..     It is also suggested that the labour M.Psn be bombarded with appeals to raise thequestion of the prison treatment of art 0&apos;Brien and his fellow conspirators:   it is claimed that they should betreated as political prisoners and not as criminals.    Ameeting was held at 182, Shaftesbury Avenue on October 2ndto appoint a new Executive Committee to deal with these twoquest ions.The recently started Irish Republican league of Great Britain appears likely to collapse:   at meetings latterly only 0&apos;Leary turned up, and he is a very poor speaker who is quite unable to craw a crowd.Republicans here profess to regard things 4n Ireland as being very hopeful Indeed.   They say that the Irish Republican Army will never submit to Cosgrave and his clique - they have gone, too far for that - and prophesy a terrible vendetta when the men in prison get out.     ill sorts of wild stories are being told as to brutal treatmentby/
11 -113by their Free State gaolers.In Scotland a settlement has been arrived at with regard to claims for compensation by deportees and the terms roughly  350   each - are regarded as being very liberal. A good deal of bad feeling, however, has been occasioned by the sward of over  1,500 to H. Warren Hutchinson, who poses as &quot;Honorary Envoy of the Irish Republic in Scotland&quot; and is regarded as being the soul of the movement:   he is Treasurer of the Republican Organisation.   The Deportees&apos; Committee is taking legal advice as to the advisability of suing certain newspspers for libel.Great disappointment is felt at the decision of the National Executive Council that Republican olubs in Sootland are net to be represented at tho forthcoming Ard Fhels in Dublin, on the grounds that none of them have been &quot;re-affiliated to Headquarters in Ireland&quot;:   it is thought that the Scottish Clubs are being purposely excluded.The Irish Republican Army&apos; in Scotland appears to be quite out of hand and it is difficult to keep up with the continual changes being made in both Brigade and Battalion Staffs:   there has been.a good deal of peculation by its higher officers.,
