[&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] -  - 1 - - t -(Printed for the Oabinet,.    December 1923,)&apos; &apos; secret.CP. 484 (23).MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA,AFGHANISTAN.A somewhat acute crisis in the relations with Afghanistan has been reached as a result of the prolonged failure of the Afghan Government to deal with certain murderers who have taken refuge in Afghanistan or to put a stop to Afghan intrigue among the tribes on the British side of the frontier. There has also been difficulty in obtaining reparation for a number of raids matte from Afghanistan.Within a few weeks of the signature, on 22nd November 1921, of the Treaty of Neighbourly Relations with Afghanistan two raids from Afghan territory were; perpetrated near Barskore and SpmchiUa respectively, involving the loss; of four British officers killed and three wounded, and 83 Indian officers, and men killed amdi wounded and the looting of a large amount of Government property.Immediately on arrival in Kabul in March 1922 His Majesty&apos;s Minister demanded, and has continued to demand, reparation for these raids and the adoption of measures to prevent future occurrences of the kind. The Afghan Government repeatedly promised compliance, but if any action was taken to fulfil the promises it was so ineffective that actually two further, though less serious, raids were committed, in October and December 1922.In April 1923 His Majesty&apos;s Minister came to the conclusion that the Afghan attitude towards Great Britain, which during 1922 had apparently been sincerely friendly, if not productive of the results desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government, had been deliberately changed for the worse. This unfavourable impression was followed by the murder on 8th April of Majors Orr and Anderson near Landi Kotal by two Afghan tribesmen, and on 13th April by the Kohat outrage (Mrs. Ellis and Miss Ellis), the perpetrators of which found refuge in Afghan tribal territory. Demands were at once formulated for action against these criminals as well as for reparation, &amp;c, for the earlier and other intermittent breaches of neighbourly relations, and His Majesty&apos;s Minister wa,rned the Afghan Government that, failing satisfaction, His Majesty&apos;s Government would feel bound to utilise their right under the treaty to refuse transit through India of munitions in the event of the Afghan Government showing plainly by its attitude that it had determined on an unfriendly and provocative course of policy towards Great Britain.In June the two Landi Kotal criminals were arrested and brought to Kabul for trial, but in mid-August they escaped and made their way back to the frontier and joined the Kohat gang.On 18th September His Majesty&apos;s Minister clearly stated His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s requirements as conditions precedent for permission to import munitions through India, but in deference to Afghan promises, that action fully meeting British requirements was on the point of consummation, refrained from presenting a formal Note.On 30th September a large consignment of munitions en route to Afghanistan from France arrived at Bombay, where it is held up.During October a portion of the reparation demanded for the ISarshore, Spin-chilla and other raids was paid (the balance being produced, after typical attempts at evasion, in November), and certain unconvincing measures were initiated against the minder gangs. By the end of the month it was clear that these measures would produce no results, and that the Afghans&apos; professed fulfilment of British demands in regard to the cessation of intrigue in VVaziristan (notably the recruitment and payment of tribesmen from British tribal territory, who still apparently spend much of their time on the British side of the frontier, as so-called khassadars or irregulars,) was illusory. On 11th November, therefore, His Majesty &apos;s Minister formally presented the Kote stating His Majesty&apos;s Governments demands which had been withheld on 18th September. Almost simultaneously, on 8th November, Captain and Mrs. Watts were murdered at Parachinar, by (as was shown within a few clays) members of the Landi Kotal and Kohat gangs working from Afghan territory and aided and abetted by Afghan tribesmen.
On 1st December (on which day Major Finnis was murdered in Zhob hy tribesmen among whom Afghan intrigue has been constant), His Majesty&apos;s Minister, after conferring at Peshawar with officers of the Government of India, took the first of a series of steps designed to convince the Afghan Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot maintain diplomatic relations with a country which cannot or will not act up to the obligations of a neighbour ; this step is to hint informally that, failing satisfaction of His Majesty&apos;s Governments requirements, the British Legation will be withdrawn shortly. The remaining steps contemplated, in the absence of clear evidence of active good-will on the part of the Afghan Government, were (2) the withdrawal from Kabul of the ladies of the British Legation ;(3).formal notice of the withdrawal of the British Minister and the Legation, tobe given a fortnight after step (2); (4) actual withdrawal of the Legation, one month after step (3).Step (2) was taken on the 11th December. Meanwhile the question of taking really effective measures against the murder-gang remains under active discussion between the British and Afghan authorities, and some further moves have been made on the Afghan side, but up to the present conclusive evidence of a whole-hearted determination to co-operate with the authorities on the British side of the frontier in hunting down the gang has not been forthcoming.PEEL.20th December 1923.
