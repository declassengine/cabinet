TEE COMMUNISTSOn December 16th the Central Executive of the Communist Party met in London &quot;to reoeive a report from tho Parliamentary Department in the recent elections ana to consider the position of the Party in regard to tho present political situation;   also to make the necessary arrangements for the forthcoming Party Conferenoe.&quot;In this connection the Manchester District PartyCommittee has been informed thati-&quot;At the meeting of the Central Committee hold yesterday it was definitely decided that the Party Conference .shall take place daring the last week-end in January.     It was also&apos; decided that the Conference shall bo held in manchester if a suitable hall can be obtained.     .&quot;We shall no-cd the oo-oporation and assistance of tho Manchester District Party Committee in mailing tho necessary arrangements, end tho first thing to be dona is to secure a suitable hill.     We shall be glad if you can take this matter *n hand immediately and ascertain and let us know what halls are available *    Wo shall went a place that is capable of accommodating about 150 delegates.seated at tables, end if additional accommodation can he arranged for visitors, so much tho better.&quot;The hell will be required all day on tha Saturday and Sunday, January 26th and 27&apos;cho&quot;District&quot;Organisere have been asked to forwardmaterial for a report which is to be made to tho&apos; conference on ths general state of the Party and theresults of tho re-organisation decided upon at thoBattefsea conference.All those communists who played a prominent partin the Party&apos;s activity during the recent election havebeen instructed to sond a full report to H eadquarterstogether with specimens of all literature issued.The Manchester District Party Committee states thatthe expenditure in connection with W. Paul1scandidature/
candidature at Rusholme &quot;ia likely to exceed the income by well over  400&quot;.    The Committee anticipates that W8R, Stoker will have to -be responsible for the deficiency &quot;unless some othor way can be found of meeting the whole or some  portion of the deficit.&quot;   The District Organiser, in appealing to Headquarters for en additional grant, writes 3-&quot;We are well aware that tho Head Office have made a substantial allocation to the election fund but tho D.P.Q. is of opinion that further efforts should be made to secure a further allocation ia order to meet a portion of tho deficit..e&quot;I do not think you need reminding of the importance of the Rncholme Election sad-of the Party values obtained.     Apart from the aotual looel . advantages, the national values have been   enormous, as ws know that Comrade Paul-&apos;4&apos;a eantidaturo has been responsible for breaking 4ora th.3 last barviostlo tJhioh separates the Coratanniei; Party from tfca Labour Party as a. unit of the working class.*    The forcing of the Executive cf the Xabour Party to grant credentials to Comrade Paul especially in view of the fast that we arc of opinion that they wers very reluctant to fight Rusholme even - with a fully credited Labour candidate, is bound to have a great effect when tho Party next applies for full affiliation to the Labour Party,     In addition the &apos; situation here ia ord which is fraught with great possibilities. - The Rusholme Labour Party members have decided to establish a permanent Baited Council is the various wards which come within tho constituency.     On Sunday evening last I attended one such meeting held In Levensbuims when the largely attended meeting unanimously &apos; decide a to establish a Levenshulme IJnited Council of all the elements in the Labour end Communist movement In that canvassed. This is to be followed immediately by a similar movement in Longsight and Rusholme Wards.    After they beooKe firmly established they will $ommeaoe to push out beyond the confines of the Parliamentary eorstituenoyt.     At the moment we are not precipitating the formation of definite Party units in tho Constituency as it appears to be more important to get them working on &quot;the above lines rather thso let It appear that we es a Oommunist Party ara keen on getting fsrty values in terms of members out -sf the lace ocnteat.    We shall of course ultimately take sisp3 to gat groups formed of Party members.&apos;1M. Philips Price, who in the course of hia contest asa Labour candidate at Gloucester, publicly denied thatwas a member of the British cr any other Communist Party,made/
made the fallowing interesting statement on.his position toE. Palme Butt on December 13th:&quot;I am afraid there can be so doubt that a statement that I em a member of the Communist Party wouia very adversely affect my position here.     The very most that the Trade  Union people here will stand is Communist sympathies, win oh I have openly admitted.     They dislike the idea that I should he bound to the discipline of a body which is outside the Labour and Socialist organisation of Gloucester. It would cause, I fear, the greatest complication and jeopardise the whole of my work here.     I have a very hard uphill fight, end I fear it will be many years before I capture this seat, as the corruption of a section of the population here i3 as bad as ever.&quot;I should be very glad if the Executive would revise the whole of my case, since what I have experienced in this election makes it clear to me that I cannot work this constituency and admit openly more than sCcmmunist sympathies&apos;.&quot;The Communist Party has again turned its attention tonext year1 s Trade Union Congress and. has 3ent to all groupsconcerned oopies of resolutions which are to be pushedthrough trade union branches by members of the Party:   theseresolutions, which are quoted below, were accompaniedby/jomprehsn3ive &quot;Speakers&quot; Notes&quot;&quot;TRADES UNION CONGRESS 1924.RESOLUTIONS.

The above mentioned Officers should sit on the G.C. Ex-Officic.(3)     The General Committee should be divided into the following Sub-committoss:(a) Organising Committee(b) Complaints        &quot;(c) Finance &quot;(d) Literature        &quot;(4)     The Sub-commit tees should be constructed as follows:(a)   Organising committee should consist of Organiser and two members of the G.C.. - (b)   Compla ints Committee.   Three members ofthe G-C.(o)   Finance.   Treasurer and two members of the government Oa(d)   Literature Secretary and two members of.C. ...(5)     The duties of sab-committees should briefly be as follows:(a) The. Organising, Commit tee should arrange for all meetings, and tie Organiser should be responsible for booking all&apos; spe akers.They should devise ways and means whichsuit the local circumstances for enrolingnew members.   They shall be responsible for organising local demonstrations and such-other activities which from time to time are determined by circumstances.   TheOrganiser is the leading individual inthis committee,,    They,should^have a squad of chalkers at their disposal.(b) Complaints Committee.   Should investigate all complaints of members concerning Labour Exchange and parish Councils, andshould/
should report regulerly to the G.C. and the Mass meetings on the progress made in this direction.Care should he- token to select individuals who are fitted for this work.(c)   Finanoo Commit toe shall attend to allfinance, and no money should be paid out without their consent.    One of their number should act as money steward on the general meeting day, reoeive contributions and stamp the members cards.   The other should act as&apos;a check steward sitting at the same table and entering in his check book by the name of the name of the comrade making payment, the money received. After the contributions have been taken, the Treasurer should then take charge of the money and gi-?e a receipt for the amount, received to the money steward, and make a weekly report to the General Commit tee.There should be a-fortnightly Audit., and the Auditors should take care to see that the money entered in the Money Steward &apos;s Check Steward &apos;a.end Treasurer&apos;s books tally, and that accordingly that amount of stamps have bean issued.fd)   literature Committee should supervise the sale and distribution of the &quot;Unemployed Wpr ker &apos; and any o th er 1 it eratura appertaining to our movement0 Tho literature Secretary shall he responsible for placing orders for literature, and have charge of money received for same and be responsible for settling all Literature accounts with Headquarters, etc.He should moke a weekly report to the G.C. end members meeting.(6)    Where it is at all possible women&apos;s sections should be set up, having their own committee with the same basis of working as the mono The two sections should wo&amp;tr harmony with each other sad should not be looked upon as two distinct organisations, but as complimentary sections of one orgauisat 1 on,&apos; namely the JJ.U.W.CH.The men should hare two representatives on the women&apos;s committee, and. the women two representatives on t$e man&apos;3 committee, this necessary in order to prevent, any overlapping in activities taking placeo(7)    Where it is advisable to run concerts or whist drives in order to augment the funds, a special entertainments committee should be set up composed preferably of members of the General Committee. Strict vigilance should be kept on finance derived from&apos; suoh entertainments, as many oi1 the c ommltfcees have suffered as a result of too loose a method of working in this respect.(8)     If. contributions do not come in satisfactorily. &apos; at/
at the mass meetings, then some arrangements should he made whereby contributions can be taken at the Keliof Stations and such placeso   Or preferably to operate the Vale of Leven&apos;s method of Street Captains who regularly collect the o cntributions of members living in certain streets.(9)     Where members have lapsed and do not come back because they cannot afford to pay up their arrears of contributions, some looal arrangement  should be made wheroby it is possible for them to rejoin as new members.    If this was done I am sure it would increase the strength of the U.U.Y/.CM. considerably.&quot;Two issues of &quot;The Unemployed worker&quot; have been published by the National Unemployed Workers&apos; CommitteeMovement:   in the first it was stated that money was urgently needed as the organisation has to pay cash ondelivery to the printer:     the second issue contained &quot;an open Letter to the Labour Party&quot; in which the writerdemanded the confiscation of capital and &quot;a real Workers&apos;. Government.&quot;IRISH HE TO LUTI OH ARY ACT I TIT TBS 13 GREAT BR LTiiJIAs far as the mass of the Irish population is concerned Irish national life in London is almost extinct:   the older msmbe rs of the community take no interest at all, and only some of the younger generation are really active:   there is, however, some talk of forming an organtsat ion on bread.national lines,, to include persons of different political views, for social purposes.A provisional committee has been formed in connection with the Irish Republican  rison&amp;srs&apos; Defence Fund with Thomas Ov Sullivan,, an ex-Dsportse, as Chairmen:     it. met at 84,&apos; Blackfriars Road,  (tha Roger Casement Sinn Fein club) on December 9th and 11th end decided to circularise all Irish organisations in London, asking them to consider the setting up of a permanent Committee to raise money for tho purposes of the Fund.Joseph Browh, formerly Sinn Fein Organiser for Scotland),.    and /
and also an ex-6eportee, has issued a special appeal to   , his friends in Scotland:   he says the amount of money in i hand is altogether inadequate to relieve the many released prisoners,  and those who are still on the hills unable to return to their homes for fear of arrest.On December 15th Brown presided at a deportee meeting, at 171, Renfield Street, Glasgow, and asked each deportee to hand over  50 to the Fund:     his appeal was badly received and at the close of the meeting there were only seven persons present, the others had disappeared:   Brown himself appears to be the only one who has subscribed  50sThe Irish Republican Army leaders here are stillpushing their scheme of re-organisation although locallyuthey appear to be making very little impression;   such recruits as they do obtain are mainly released prisoners or men &quot;on the run&quot; from Ireland.In Scotland a big effort is being made to put the Republican Clubs back on their old footing as part of the Sinn Fein organisation, and to increase their numbers:   Joe Robinson, ex &quot;O/C&quot;. Scotland&quot;, is coming back into the movement and addressed a Republican gathering in Sword street,. Glasgow, cn December 9th:   he wants them to keep the old flag flying and get back to Sinn Fein.     They hope to reconstruct ass organisation tha\ will swamp Cos grove and his &quot;Imperial parliament&quot;-end mar lied enthusiasm in this direction is notice able.
