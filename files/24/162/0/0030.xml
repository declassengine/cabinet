The Political Bureau of the.Communist Party basis  suea a oiroular to District Party Committees regardingthe situation in Germany and. tho need for Britishsupport; of the German workers:   the text of this document is as follows:&quot;Tho critical situation that exists in Germany demands our constant ana earnest attention.     All the indications point to the near approach of the final revolutionary struggle.&quot;The task before the German Proletariat is a gigantic one, but we feel certain that they will emerge triumphant and that a Workers&apos; Government will establish itself in power.   But even now as they face the crisis, the greatest crisis that ever a working class has been called upon to face, they ask themselves., &quot;Can we rely on the workers of Europe for support&apos;.     To this question the Frenoh workers have replied in the affirmative.   The most active propaganda is being carried on throughout Franoa and amongst the soldiers in the Ruhr.   Many French comre6.es are now in prison because of the effectiveness of their work.&quot;In Belgium, Holland, Poland and Gseeho-Slovakia, the workers are demonstrating their -solidarity with their German comrades.&quot;In Britain alone do we fine this great struggle being ignored.   Yet sxipport from the British workers-is absolutely essential.   There is no hope, however, in our Labour Leaders.   They have formed a United Front with Baldwin,. Curzon and Co., for the purpose of boosting British Imperialism.   They are betraying the German proletariat as they betrayed the proletcsriat of this country during the Miners&apos; lock-out.   But if our Leaders fail, all the more need is there for intense activity on our part.&quot;We propose therefore that District Conferences of all active workers be held throughout the country, for the purpose of declaring our solidarity with the German workers.     Will you start now and arrange such a conference in your district at the earliest possible moment?   Get delegates from Trade Union Branches, delegates from Trades Councils and Local Labour Parties, delegates from I.L.pe, Co-operatives, or other working class organisationSn   Make It an All-in Conference with the first business a message of encouragement to the workers of Germany.   Follow this up with a resolution demanding that the Labour Party Executive and the General council of the Trade Union Congress, make an immediate declarationpledging/
pledging support to the German workers.   Then, a resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of all British troops from the occupied area, these resolutions &quot;to he sent to the labour party Sxecutive and the General Council.&quot;Please proceed with this without delay.   The sittxation is the most critical in the history of the working class, aid the Gorman workers eagerly look for some evidence of sympathy and support from the workers of this country.&quot;In the issue of the &quot;Workers&apos; weekly&quot; dated October 19th If. Hannington writes en article entitled &quot;Hands off the German Workers&quot;, which contained the following passages:&quot;The situation calls for immediate action on our part,   livery working-class organisation, in this country, including the national Unemployed workers1 Committee Movement, must he prepared to prevent by all means in their power British soldiers or mxinitions being sent to assist German Capitalism against the workers.&quot;British regiments are already at Cologne. A regiment ox Camerons left Aldershot several days ago for Germany.   More troops and more munitions will be sent unless the British workers determine to stop it.&quot;An immediate intensive campaign must bo started, especially in the ports.   The Labour Party and the General Council of the T.U. Congress must come out into the open and state what their polioy is on this question.   If they haven*t yet got one, then they must immediately formulate one, or for ever stand condemned and disgraoed in the eyes of the world&quot;s workers.&quot;The Head Office of the  rational Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement has already sent out instructions to certain of its branches, to suggest the immediate setting up of emergency counoils to prepare for the campaign:    &quot;Hands Off Workers&apos; Germany!&apos;&quot;The Communist Party&apos;s &quot;Propaganda Bulletin Ho. 4.&quot;also deals with Germany:   although much of the matter isrepetition, two passages are not uninteresting:&quot;The ruin and ohaos in Germany due to the rule of the Imperialists supported by the Liocial Democrats should be contrasted with the steady improvement in the social life of working class Hussia.   It Bhould be noted that the Communist Tarty in Russia inherited a ruined state from the Capitalists and land e d/
landed Junkers arid were menaced with a blockade on all fronts...&quot;The Kaiser has been replaced by Poinoaro. Militarism is more rampant than ever.   Russia with her policy of disarmament holds the key to the menace df Militarism.&quot;Only the triumph of workers&apos; Governments can end the period of chaos end lay the foundations of 8 real world peace.&quot;The annual conference of the Communist party would,in the ordinary course of events, have been belt&apos; thismonth:   the reasons for its postponement until January atthe earliest are given in a circular sent to District andLocal Party Committees on October 18th:&quot;The Hext Party conference&quot;The central executive committee, at its meeting on October 7th, had under consideration the question of the date for holding the next party conference.&quot;Ordinarily the Party conference should be held annually and should have taken place during the present month   Two considerations, however, have influenced the Central Committee in this matter.     The first was a general recommendation issued by the Communist International that the national conferences of the communist parties in the different countries should be held after the International Congress.,   The next International Congress does not take plane until March of next year.   The second determining consideration was the conference of our central executive eoranittee with the Presidium of the Communist International in Moscowj the reconstruction of the central ccnmlttee and the political bureau that then took place, and the charging of those bodies with new and specific tasks. Had the finances of the Party permittee, the central executive committee, on its return from Moscow, would have summoned a Party Conference to receive a report and ratify the decisions arrived at.   As that was not possible, a meeting of the party Council was convened when the decisions reached in Moscow were fully reported and endorsed.&quot;The central executive committee, however, is fully aware of the desirability of convening a national Party Conference as goon as possible, and has decided to aim at such conference being held by the end of the second week in January.   Further announcements end instructions regarding the conference will be issued to the district and local party organisations in due oourse.&quot;Some months ago the Communist party of Great Britain took over.the printing plant of the Lithuanian Communistfederation/
Federation in Bellshlli, Lanarkshire, and ever since then has been trying to dispose of it.    Protracted negotiations with various possible buyers have greatly exercised the Executive Committee which originally demanded  650 for the plant:   last week everything, except a few small items which had been disposed of for  10, was sold to a Glasgow firm for  300.    This money will be most acceptable to tho London communists who are at present facing unusually hard times.Those Listrict Party Organisers whose weekly grants have been &quot;cut&quot;, in accordance with the plan outlined in last week&apos;e report, are up in arms against Headquarters:     the Liverpool officials have gone to the length of protesting to the other District party Committees affected that &quot;the action of the 3:recutive Committee is unwarranted and as such not in the best Interests of the Party&quot;.     If tha Eascutive persists in its decision the Liverpool Distriot party Committee has decider to withhold its dues to headquarters.The Communist Bookshop at Ziftjj Street is advocating the establishment of book-clubs in all local organisations of the Communist Party for the purpose of reading and studying communist literature:   the suggestion is that each member of a local should take a number of shares at 2d., 6d. or 1/- each and that the total so collected, should be spent in buying communist literature from the book-shop.On October 22nd Harry pollitt stated that:&quot;A Transport Workers&apos; Committee has been set up to assist the Industrial Department in preparing to take stops to meet a number of coming crises in various sections of the Transport industry.   The proepsct of the ending of the Looks&apos; agreement in the&quot; Hew Year makes it very urgent to get out a clear statement of demands for a new agreement.&quot;Something in the nature of a practical joke appears tohave been played upon the Liverpool communists who attached great/
greet importance to a mass meeting which they had arranged tohold, in connection with the Autumn campaign, in the stadiumon October 14-th:   the Chief Constable of Liverpool has sentme the following account of the matter:&quot;Ihe place and date of the meeting had been arranged by the CP. sobb weeks ago, end typed handbills advertising same hcd been distributed throughout the City.     On the 12th instant an advertisement appeared in the early- editions of the &quot;Liverpool 3cho*, announcing the meeting and the speakers, including Palme Butt. In the last edition of the newspaper (which is printed about 5 p.m.) this advertisement was withdrawn, and the following one inserted:&quot;&quot;Communist party.   Important.   Meeting at the Stadium on ijunday unavoidably postponed.&apos;&quot;On the following morning, Saturday, John Brad dock and I.P. Hughes, called at the office &quot;oil the &quot;Liverpool Echo&apos;,-ana wore shewn the advice the paper received asking for the advertisement postponing meeting to be Inserted.   It was written on the Party&apos;s official paper and signed &quot;Bessie Braddook&apos;1, which is the name of&quot; John Brad dock&apos;s wife.     Hughes, Braddock, and his wife, came direct from Hie newspaper office to this department, and asked that we take the matter up with a view to tracing who it was that forged Mrs. Brad dook&apos;s signature ana caused the bogus advertisement to be inserted in the paper.     This is being done.&quot;Luring the Saturday evening and night, members of the C.P. extensively chalked on the footways, and on some buildings in the City, as follows:&quot;&quot;Meeting of Communist Party, Stadium, Sunday, 14th October, 7.30 p.m.1Uext morning,. Sunday, it was noticed that in every instance the word postponed&apos; in chalk was written underneath the announcement, and that a large poster, outside the Stadium advertising the meeting had been defaced by means of other paper matter being pasted on it. On those facts becoming known to the CP. members were detailed to put the chalking advertisements in order by rubbing out the word &quot;postponed1.   .A fresh bill was put on the poster outside the Stadium, following which a member of the Party kept watch on the poster all day until the meeting started, and other members kept watch on the ohalkings, in case a further attempt would be made to destroy the advertisements..&quot;The meeting was duly held and between five and six hundred people were addressed by Harry Webb, Ellen Wilkinson, H. Martin and I.P. Hughes:   H. Palme Butt was to have been one of the speakers but failed to appear as he had receiveda/
a bogus telegram saying that the meeting was postponed.S. saklatvala, M.P*, has informed one of the District Organisers, who required his services as a speaker, that:&quot;The first free week-end will be after April 6th, 1924.    All others are booked up.    As far as possible 1 avoid taking two meetings in any one day as I am breaking down a bit.&quot;Sunday 3rd February, 1924, is under consideration for a special arrangement.   If that does not come off I oan give that to you.&quot;Terms, whatever the lteilvsay Co. end Taxi chap require - no extras and no tips for self.&quot;THE RED IINTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONS.The issue of &quot;The VI or tor&quot; dated October 12thcontained one of a series of articles by A, Losovsky,the Moscow General Secretary of the Red Internationalof Labour Unions, entitled &quot;The Immediate Tasks of theRed International of Labour unions&quot;:   the followingpassages are taken from this article, which has beenstibmitted to the Lord Advocate:&quot;The struggle against war takes a different form in the imperialist states from what it has in the colonial countries.   Por example, the tasks of the working class in England and in France are completely different from those of the workers in India and Algiers.   In the colonial countries, oppressed by imperialism, it is frequently the revolutionary elements who are the first to raise and lead the war against the imperialist robbers. The workers&apos; organisations in the imperialist robber states are duty bound to go to the assistance of the workers of the colonies in their fight against imperialism.   In this connection the old &quot;&quot;trade union and politioal organisations have not only done nothing, but on the oontrary have actually done everything they could to bring the workers of the colonial countries under the influence of the imperialism of their native land.&quot;The struggle against war does not mean that we have to aooept the pacifist mode of thought;   on the oontrary, we must resist the apostles of pacifism to the utmost.   For the essence of pacifism just lies in this, that it opposes war, but not the conditions that produce war, and furthermore opposes every war without exoeption.   The revolutionary workers on the other hand are not against every war.   They are infavour/
favour of the wars fought by the oppressed colonies, of the war of the exploited against the exploiters, of the revolutionary war that can bring victory to the workers of a country.   She workers&apos; movement must have nothing to do with pacifist cant.     We desire peace, we struggle against w*r - but it is only against imperialist war.   We resist imperialist war by class war.   At the moment of the victory of the working class in any particular country we must be ready for the revolutionary struggle, for the creation of our own army, for unity of command of all the revolutionary armies, which must make war upon international capital as a whole.   The struggle against the menace of war is closely bound up with the struggle against the whole system, with the preparation of the masses for class war, with the battle for victory over the bourgeoisie find with the efforts for the formation of a revolutionary army. We are no bourgeois pacifists we are revolutionaries. Therefore we must prepare for war.   Only rifle in hand will we be able to overthrow that industrial order whioh to-day bears so heavily upon the workers of all lands.&quot;Most of the documents sent to the British Bureau of the Bed International of labour Unions by the Mid-European Bureau during the past week have dealt with the situation in Germany:   several of them were merely repetition of matter already reported but extracts from three appear to be worth quotation:(1)     The Moscow Srecutive of the Red International of Labour Unions to all affiliated organisations.&quot;Moscow, October 10, 1923.&quot;Confidential.&quot;To all organis at ions aff11i ated to &apos;the&apos; Ked &quot;Laternatlonal of labour Unions.       &quot;&quot;Dear Comrade,&quot;The development of events in Germany confront all the organisations affiliated to the lied International of Labour Unions with the question of the ways end means of aiding the German proletariat. Hardly anyone doubts tho nearness of the revolution. There can be no doubt as to the extremely bitter struggle which the revolutionary German workers will have to engage in, avid that only by mobilising and concentrating the proletarian forces in all countries can we possibly insure the victorious-outcome ofr the German Revolution...&quot;How can we prevent the world bourgeoisie from doing/
doing with Germany what it has succeeded in doing with revolutionary Hungary?  Only by rallying all proletarian forces around the following concrete slogans:1*    Down with intervention] &apos; 2.     Hands off revolutionary Germany! 3.     Clear out of the occupied territory! 4,     Down with War I5.     Full aid to the German proletariat!6o     Better to die on the barricades than topermit a new warJ 7.     Long live the world union of Workers&apos; andBe as ant, s&apos; He pub lie a..,&quot;We mus.t all hear in mind that the period of resolutions and phrases is past.   Everyone of our organisations should estimate its own strength and that of the class enemy that confronts it;   it should then attack the weakest spots of the enemy&apos;s front,   ill organisations affiliated to the iuI.L.U. should bear in mind that the defeat of the German revolution would mean the collapse of the Russian Revolution and the triumph of Fasoist banditary for many years!&quot;ALL FORCES AND EEAN3 TO THE AID OF THE GERMAN REVOLUTION!&quot;He who sees not the greatest danger for the world proletariat in the triumph of the German fasoib-i is a criminal.&quot;Prepare for the German events!

&quot;...The Gorman workers therefore will he engaged in the next time in a desperate defensive struggle against capitalism...&quot;When this great and decisive struggle of the German workers shall he finished successfully for us, the revolutionary groups of printing trade workers in the principal countries of Europe must contribute their possible- Attention of Printing trade workers must be concentrated especially on two points.1.     It must be prevented that banknotes are printed in foreign countries for fasoistio governments who oould have temporarly the political power in their .. hands in Germany.g.     The Printing workers in the most important countries must try to prevent the distribution of falsified informations on the German revolution, and to suppress by all means informations who are nuisible for the fighting German workers.&quot;I beg you to discuss this questions with our comrades in the printing trades to find out the best way to help the German workers in their struggles   I think it will be good to bring this questions also before the administrative bodys of the printing trade unions in your country.&quot;Then I will touch another question.   The Moscow offices of our I.P.C. want of us to publish our International Printing Trades Review - who is published till now only in German language -. now also in English.   I think that such an edition could be successful now because the revolutionary situation in Germany could produoe at the British printing Workers some attention to the international labour movement and to R.I.L.TJ. tactics.   But there would be certainly some difficulties about the sale, because you don&apos;t have till now a R.I.t1.TJ. organisation in the printing trades of England,   perhaps it would be possible to start now a movement in the Printing. Trades by publishing a first issue of an International. Printing Trades Review in English language...&quot;The International Propaganda Committee of Revolutionary Miners to all organisations of Revolutionary Miners.&quot;British Bureau. .   &quot;Berlin, loth Oct. 1923,&quot;52.-.?.Pi..P2: 5:1^-s   l.dios of Kiv^Uyl ona?yH&apos;? nV: s7&quot;Help the German Revolutions1&quot;*.v The miners of the world must bo ready to support the German revolution.

In London the Unemployed Workers&apos; Organisation is also fairly active.Hannington is touring the provinces on behalf of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement:   he reached Barrow at the end of last week but the Chief Constable states that his visit aroused little enthusiasm.     On October 23rd he went to Glasgow and is cue in Dundee from October 29th to November 5th.There has been some talk of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement providing pickets in connection with the strike of dustmen at Fulham and on October 22nd 100 Battersea unemployed marched to tfulham dust shoot.On October 19th Albert papworth, one of the leaders of the Battersea unemployed was arrested for obstructing a policeman in the execution of his duty in connection with -an unemployed meeting:   he was bound ovor to keep the -peace.IRISH RE &quot;TO PUT10NARY ACTIVITIES IS GREAT Britain there is still very little news in Irish extremistcircles/
ih  IP, *314circles here ana developments are not to he expected until the deportee question is settled.   In London there are only three real points of danger, the Roger Casement Sinn Fein Club which holds its meetings at 184, Blackfriare Road;   the Peckham Sinn Fein Club which meets at Ho,, 3, &apos;iueon&apos;s Road, Peckham; and the 0&apos;Lonovan Ross Club at Tooting.     Although members of the Irish Republican Army are not allowed to take any active part in the proceedings of any of these clubs, in order not to bring themselves under notice, they are usually to be found at one or other of them.   Just now there is no unity of action;   the would-be leaders are quarrelling among themselves and some of them, notably Sean Harvey, are out to make all they can for themselves.The &quot;Scottish&quot; deportees having received their money, are dispersing:   quite a number of them have left, or are leaving for Canada:   more are returning to Ireland, and a competent observer is of opinion that very few of them willtake any further part in the movement.T.P. 0&quot;Connor&apos;s Irish Democratic league does not appear to have met with much response in London, whore the Irish are shy of all kinds of leagues:   in South Wales and in the north of England, however, fair progress is being made.The Irish Republican Army in Scotland is still without any definite leadership and there is nothing but confusion in its ranks:   &quot;Captain&apos;&quot; Farrell, who visited Headquarters in Dublin last week, has returned and attended a Brigade Council meeting at the Trongate Hall, Glasgow, on October 19th.   The acting JI0/C, Scotland&quot;, John Slane of Motherwell, called Farrell to attention and ordered himto/
to coaB9 activities in his (Diane&apos;h) military area:   parrellreplied th&amp;t he would So nothing of the kind andquestioned olene1s authority to assxtao contro1:   partof the Council&apos;supported Diane and others Jarre 11 and anangry scene followed.Slane has also quarrelled with Michael Flannigau, 0/C 1st. Battalion, and the latter at once left for Ma no he star to appeal to Humphreys, de Valera&apos;s ohief agent here.It seems fairly dear, however, that the Espublican leaders in Ireland are planning further trouble in the Worth.   Much is being made oi&apos; the boundary question and the oath of allegiance required of Roman Catholic school teachers.   Attempts made to induce responsible men in northern Ireland to take up the work of re-organising the Irish Republican Army there, have, howevar, met with very little suooess.
