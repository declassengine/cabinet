s E5111Cory No.f0 A B I S E TCP. 488 (23).REPARATIONS.(Note by the OJiaaoojJLojC of the Exchequer.,)I circulate for the information of my colleagues.a letter which I have received ffcosh Sir John Bradbury.    1 am just leaving London for Cardiff and 1 shall be away for the greater part of next week speaking in the North and it may bo that during that time an occasion may arise when the Cabinet would wish to have my views before them:    these views are almost exactly expressed in Sif John Bradbury&apos;s letter.It seems to me quite essential that the enquiry shall not bo limited to the &quot;capacite actuelle&quot; of Germany.     Naturally it Tsould bo of great advantage if the U.SoA. oould be induced, to insist that there shall be no such restriction, and I think therefore that we should at once ascertain her attitude towards an enquiry limited in the manner suggested in tho French reply. But if this leads to nothing helpful wo must, I think, leave M, Poincare in no doubt that we cannot consent  to invite the U.S.A, to nominate a member of a Committee whose activities would be confined in the way ho wishes.NoC,
British Delegation,Reparation Commission, Hotel Astoria, Paris.1st November, 192S.My dear Chancellor,I hear from lord Crewo, whp&amp;r I saw this morning, that the French Government has concurred in the proposod invitation to the United States to nominate a representative to a Committee of Experts to be appointed by the Reparation Commission to consider German capacity of payment, on condition that the enquiry shall be limited to the &quot;oapaoite actaellen of Germany, and that neither the Reparation Commission nor the proposed Committee shall \ have powers outside the scope of those belonging to the Commission, and those which can be delegated by the Commission to ivS committees under the provisions of the Treaty.To the second of these suggestions I do not think it is possible to take objection.     It will no doubt be made the foundation for obstruction of the Committee&apos;s enquiries, and may even be used to destroy the utility of the Committee altogether, but for the reasons which I have developed in previous letters, I think the risk of this ought to be taken.The other proposed amendment is, however, far more important.     The French word &quot;aotuelle&quot; is very iifftcult to translate into English;   probably tho latinphrase
6 D 8phrase &apos;rebus exstantibus&apos; would be used by an equity draftsman to render the idea. &apos;The intention of introducing tho&quot;word is undoubtedly to prevent the Committee from-making any recommendations for a permanent modification of the Schedule of Payments, or a reduction of&apos;the total of the capital liability, of Germany as determined by the Reparation Commission under Article 233 of the Treaty.If the French suggestion is accepted by us and the United States, and the enquiry set up on terms of reference so limited, I personally am convincod that it can lead to no practical result beyond a further wasto of time, and I should find it very difficult to support a proposal for an ennuiry of this character in the Reparation CoamiBBion.II the enquiry is to servo any useful purpose, 1 think it most important that the limitation should not   / appear in the terms of reference as finally settled.It might, of course, be eliminated at any one of three stages,(1) before the proposed invitation isafldressod to the United States Government,(2) in the process of tho discussionwith that Government of tho conditions upon which thoir co-operation will be afforded, or(3)-bp the Reparation Commission when it comes to settle the formal terms of reference.Unless its disappearance can be rolled upon at either tho second or third.stage, it soems to me to be essential
essential t&amp;at it ahoulf? ba ^Uinisat^ at tha fls?st.Whatever action the Reparation Commission:, or a majority of it, might take, if it were left to un-tramreelleol discussion to settle thfe terms of reference, it is perfectly clear that if limitations are suggested by the Gcrvertiment3themselvesj they are not likely to be set aside by the Commission^The&quot; elimination, therefore, If it is to take place, will have to take place- either at the first or second stagei     If we&apos;.cars he perfectly sure that it will take place at the second, there would no doubt be very great advantage from the point of view of the effect on world opinion that it should so happen, but unless we can be perfectly sure of this, I am strongly of opinion that it would be most unwise to allcw the word ^ctuelle&apos; to appear in the invitation to be addressed bo America,:- Further, if in fact a Committee cf Experts isset up by the Reparation Commission to&apos; consider what is the capacity ef Germany &quot;in the conditions and clrcum-stances prevailing, at the present time&quot;, it seems to me obvious that the effects will be to fpsrcs the attention of the Committee upon the causes which are affecting that capacity at the present moment, e.g., the ehaetie state of German Internal finance and-currency, and the confus-ion created by the France-gelgian military occupations of the Ruhr and passive resistance to that occupation&apos;;which has T;een going on&apos;for the la,st nine months.While
,      TThile I am far from thinking that a really-impartial enquiry Into this question! to the exclusion of anything else might not have very&quot;salutary an  far-reaching results, such an enquiry would? quite clearly he entirely different from the kind of&apos;inves- &apos; tlgations conteniplatec? by the British Government in their . original note to the United&apos; States. .  That a committee., with, such a reference would be able to avoid considering the questions of how the French and Belgians cOme to be in the Ruhr, and of their title to stay there, seems to me to be almost inconceivable, unless, indeed, they were prepared! to limit their report on the capacity of. Germany in existing conditions to the single .word &quot;nil&quot; --1 a---&apos;&apos;-judgment for which, I believe, some support can be&apos;found5 in recent utterances of the French President of the -Council. - . ,&apos;&apos;- ------- But while something may be said for the limitedterms of reference, If it is thought desirable-to joins battle on a new front, I do. not imagine that- In the- . general state of international relations-It would-be thought wise-by His-MajestyTs Government to- embark upon a procedure which .would emphasize the opposition ^hlcTji Is&quot; already known to exist between Francis and British views.I put-this point of view to the Ambassador this morning,     Be seemed very mud impressed by it, and sug-gested that I should put It \a you without delay.Yours sincerely,(Sgd)    JOHN BRADBURY.   &apos;Rt. Hon.Neville Chamberlain, .&apos;.Esq.,M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer, HuM.1reasury,Yniitehall,S.W. 1.
