InmCTISTS Affl) &apos;J!HB GENERAL KIBCffllONL While there iB no actual evidenoe, it would appearhighly probable that the Communist Party has received asum of money from Russian sources for election espouses.It will be remembered that a few weeks ago the party&apos;sfinances had touched rock-bottom and that, despite themoney accruing from the mortgage on King Street,drastic curtailment of expenses at Headquarters and in theprovinces was made:   these, revised arrangements were to stand until the subsidy for next year was received.Then came the General Election and the party agreed toput up  300 for W. Paul&apos;s oandidature at Rusliolme,re-instated for the period of the election severaldismissed officials, sent a total sum of  -100 todistrict organisers end pledged itself to pay tho expensesof a panel of 6ight national speakers, who must havedisbursed considerable sums in travelling between London,Useray, Manchester, Rusholme, Glasgow, Motherwell,Greenock and Dundee.At a moderate estimate the items.enumerated abovemust have totalled  500 and a further sum of  1,275 has beenallooated to communist dandidates in Scotland.The letter quoted below, dated November 28th, 1923,was sent from Headquarters to Harry Pollitt, who is incharge of the communist election campaign in Scotland:&quot;We are now in a position to form a better estimate of the funds- that will be available to enable us to meet our obligations and commitments in respect of the several party candidatures and the general work of the party in the general election.&quot;I think we can now safely say that we are certain to be able to meet the guarantees given by us in respect of the Scottish constituencies, namely:Motherwell  325Dundee  500Greenock  200Kelvingrove  250 , ii&quot;There/
&quot;There is no apparent likelihood, however, of our being able to make additional grants to any of these amounts, and I have therefore written to the comrades at Motherwell, Dundee, Greenock and Eelvingrove telling them this end pointing out that it is essential that they should work to keep the expenditure within the limits of the sums guaranteed: &apos; plus such amounts as they are able to raise locally, I shall be glad if you will take such opportunities as you have of impressing this fact upon them.&quot;We have already sent supplies of the Party manifesto into the constituencies and shall be following these up with supplies of the different leaflets^   We propose to charge these up to the constituencies at cost price and deduct the amount payable from their respective grants.&quot;There still remain the communist candidates in Bethnal Green, North Battersea end Ashton-under-Iyne and while there is no evidence to show that they have been financed by the Communist Party it is not unreasonable to suppose that this is the case:   in regard, to fiaklatvala an informant has reported that he seemed to have received money from an unknown source.Confirmation of the grant allocated to Newbold is contained in a letter dated November 28th sent to his election agent hy the Organising Bureau of the Communist Party:&quot;We are now.in a position to form a better estimate as to the funds that will be available in respect to our several candidates arid the party&apos;e general work in connection with the Election.&quot;I think we can now safely say that we shall be certain to put up the total amount guaranteed by us for Comrade Newbold!s candidature at Motherwell, namely  325c   There is, however,, no apparent likelihood of our being able to advance any&quot; additional sum over and above this amount.   It is essential that you should bear this in mind and work accordingly to keep the total expenditure within the limits of this amount plus whatever the comrades are able, to raise locally.&quot;On November 30uh A.L. Homer of Maerdy was sent by the Organising Bureau  10 on account for his expenses as a speaker on behalf of communist candidates.,The Communist Party election manifesto and address have been sent to candidates in quantities sufficient tox enable/:.
3 -enable thorn to send one to eaoh voter in their constituencies:   Headquarters state that:&quot;It is impossible for ub to stand the cost of printing these manifestoes in addition to the grants being made to the different constituencies.   We are therefore proposing to charge the manifestoes up to the candidates at cost prioe and to set the amounts in question against the grant being made from headquarters.   The amounts in question so far as the Scottish constituencies ere concerned are as follows:, Dundee  32.10.0.Motherwell  15. 0.0.greenock  13.15.0.Kelvingrove  13. 0.0.&quot;Wintrlnghsm has been &quot;added to the pay list of &apos;Ihe Workers&apos;&apos; Weekly&apos;for the period of the eleotion,&quot;The circular quoted below exemplifies the work beingdona by small oommunist organisations in districts where no Party candidate is standing:&quot; Thames V*. 11 ey Loo a 1 Organis s tion &quot;Communist party, Great retain.&quot;&quot;&quot;Urgent and Importantj&quot;To all Labour supporters in the Thames valley.&quot;Comrades,&quot;There may be no working-.Class C*;ndidate standing for Eleotion this time in your Division - there will be next time I   But don&apos;t stand helplessly end idly by on that account;   there is work to he done in Twiokonham.   Helpers and workers are urgently needed. The Thames Valley Communists have already thrown the whole of their membership into the struggle in the Twickenham Division.&quot;We appeal to all genuine Labour supporters to rally to the support &quot;of Mr, 8, Sherman, end to throw all their energy and enthusiasm into the work of defeating a reactionary Ex-Csbinet Minister, fend winning a striking Labour Victory.&quot;Comrades, there is still time for much effective work to be done.   Come and helpj    Report as Boon as possible, to the Central&apos; &apos;CommTtTee Rooms, The cottage, Cross Deep, Twickenham (1st turning on left past Twickenham Tram Junction).   Work ana Fight for .your own Class!(The Committee T.V.L.O.C.P.)&quot;A.M. Wall, extracts from whose speech at ClaphamCommon on November 25th were quoted in last week&apos;B report,said/
said at a communist meeting held under the auspices of the National Union of police and prison Officers on November End that   parliament was the laBt link with the system viiioh stole the land from the people, and until Parliament v/as destroyed the workers had no hope of any hut the meanest existence.   It was Parliament which made it possible for a small but influential minority to rule the majority; a rule which would be maintained by all the armed forces of the Crown./  It would be no use then holding a ballot paper against machine guns and bayonets.     Iho people had fought in the past, Wall continued, in order that others might help themselves to a little more land during their absence abroad and, he concluded, he did not see why they should not fight for themselveB the next time and win back what had unquestionably been stolen from them in the past.The communists in Dundee set great store on the visit of Jim Larkin to support G*llacher&apos;3 candidature:     onNovember 29th the election agent informed pollitt that:&quot;So far aa Jim Larkin is concerned we must have him on Sunday and on Wednesday provided he can stay so long but so far as Monday and Tuesday is concerned you are welcome to have his services.    I will speak to him as soon as he arrives and will wire you if ho can be in Glasgow on Monday so that you oen intimate to the boys to advertise him.   He will be a big draw in Dundee and I bolieve will bring thousands of votes to Bill.&quot;*(The Chief Constable of Dundee informs me that Larkin was not present at the Sunday meeting: he arrived in Dundee on December 3rd.)In Motherwell, on the other hand, J.T. WaltonNewbold endeavoured to make his fight a &quot;class issue&quot;:   onNovember 29th he informed Pollitt that:&quot;Joss, White, Dougan and many others here, like myself, doubt the advisability of bringing Larkin here. We are avoiding, as much as possible, the green-orange, the whole Irish feud.   The Catholics are unstable afte  the priest episode but M&apos;well and lilshaw are much better/
better and the works meetings are solid ly friendly.   I want - and looal comrades except Dcnnellys - to build on the Scots element.   I know, from what I learned from some of the Italian L.C., the danger from the Church.&quot;I fear that larkin would antagonise even some of the frish.     Where does he stand?   Is he Sinn Fein query.   It would, I fear, throw back the great t.u. mass at last moving with ub slowly but surely.&quot;If, however, you insist, then he will take a picture house in Cralgneuk but it would be most unwise to use him in the Scottish ends...&quot;I am sure you will realise the importance of new tactic to which we have resorted.   No speakers this time of the obvious Irish tinge.    We fight purely on the CLASS issue...&quot;people will Just say &apos;0h his usual and last card playing up to the Irish1.   Don.&apos;t press it.&quot;Eobert Stewart has informed a Dundee communist that hehas:&quot;Seen a banner which is being presented to the British Communists from the Moscow District Committee of the Russian Party.   It is a beauty and I hope it may arrive in time for Com. Gallacher&apos;s election meetings.&quot;According to a statement made on December 3rd by the Edinburgh correspondent of &quot;The Workers&quot; Daily&quot;, R.F. Wilson, the Labour candidate for Leith is a communist.The Chief Constable of Dundee has sent me a copy of the first issue of &quot;The Workers&apos; Daily&quot; for Scotland, dated December 2nd:   this paper Is comparatively mild in tone owing, no doubt, to the fact that its main theme is &quot;Vote Labour fend Communist&quot;.te^OMMDMISiT ACTIVITIESThe Communist Party has instructed all members who belong to the Amalgam&amp;ted Society of Woodworkers to support the undermentioned candidates for union offices in the Deoember aleotions: &quot;General CouncilDistrict Ho.l.     -   J.

So it actually did happen.-Our delegate could not, owing to passport difficulties, leave Berlin in time, end came to Salzburg only September 19th, a day after theconference/
conference had been adjourned.&quot;Taking advantage of the absence of our delegates, the E.C. of the International did not consider the proposal for the United Front, in spite of the feat that it was supposed to have formulated its opinion on this question, which was to have been on the agenda, irrespective of the presence of our delegate and which was placed there even prior to our request for the admission of our delegate...&quot;We now intend to establish the united front by rallying all the revolutionary groups to the International Propaganda Committee.&quot;We are therefore greatly in need of information on the militant groups with the British unions, their numerical strength, leaders and ss to whether these groups could take part in en international conference which we propose to hold in the nearest future.&quot;please write us with regard to these questions without delay,&quot;The Executive of the Bed International of labour Unions has instructed all national sections to make collections towards a fund of 50,000 dollars for the relief of Bulgarian revolutionaries.The Central committee of the All Russian Union of textile Workers has sent the following communication tothe British Bureau of the Bed Internetionel of labourUnions for delivery to Messrs. Tom Shaw and Ben Turner:&quot;The Central Conmittee of the All-Bussian Union of Textile Workers in the mmee of 450,000 -Russian textile workers addresses the organised textile workers of England in your person.   When you visited Russia, 3 years ago, you were able to convince yourselves personally, of what the Russian textile workers in the free proletarian soviet Republio are capable in spite of the hardest privations consequent to civil war and under the worst wants. The past 3 years have not gone by without leaving any marks.   Thanks to the determination and the efforts made by the organised textile workers, the textile factories work with nearly the same intensity as in the pre-war period, and although e number of faotories are expected to cloei consequent to the lack of first materials, the textile workers nevertheless believe in a happy revival of the industry in the next future. All minda of the workers end their organisations are exclusively directed towards reconstructing the country and the civilisatory development of the masses that have been subdued for centuries by the Cforiet regime.
&quot;Tho ultimataV8 and unjustified declaration of the government of your country is threatening to break off this work, to give tho workers guns instead of tools, and to lead the labourers of all countries toward new privations.   The declaration also means dangers for the English proletariat, as it will give issue in tho first line to an increase of the unemployment, that is already greet enough in your &quot;country, it ct:n also demand bloody sacrifices for the glory of capitalism.&quot;In this decisive hour, we call upon you in the name of proletarian solidarity, and of the mutual interests of our countries, not to permit a new pernicious historical mistake to be made.&quot;Like our union members, we declare:&quot;&apos;We w&amp;nt no war, we have no time for it, we slull, however, defend the independence of our soviet Republic&quot;long live the International solidarity of the Textile workers!   Hands off Soviet-Russia.&apos;&quot;The following extracts from the minutes of a meetingof the Glasgow pi strict Committee of the Red Internationalof labour Unions held on November 22nd are quoted as an illustration of tho work being carried on by this organisation inside the trade unions:&quot;A letter, intimating change of delegate from the Vehicle Builders was read.&quot;Throe letters from A.E.U. Branches, asking for speakers, wore left in Secretary&apos;s ht-nds, to see if he could supply the speakers for the date mentioned. This concluded the correspondence.&quot;Secretary submitted his Report,   Eighty-four circulars had been dispatched to A..E.U. Branches in Glasgow, offering to supply speakers from the Red International of labour Unions..     Several branches had taken advantage of offer already,&quot;He also explained position with regard to severs! domestic Rod International of Labour Union matters.   This concluded his report, which was ad opted,1&quot;Comrade Ogilvie explained reason of his failure to spook at Milton Branch of the A.E.U.     It was decided that Secretary write a letter of apology and suggest another data.&quot;The Vehicle Builders&apos; delegate submitted a report of negotiations whioh wore taking piece at present between his Union and the employers, relative to wages and conditions.   The Scottish Section of theemployers/
employers wished to enter into a local agreement&quot;with the men, hut negotiations were still going on, as this, was an old game of the Scottish Employers.&quot;A brief report of the conditions of affairs in connection with the Boilermakers&apos; dispute was given by the delegates from that Union.&quot;A circular letter issued by the British Bureau of the Red International of labour Unions, and dealing with the position in the coalfields and on the railways was considered.   It was decided that Secretary, along with Comrade Campbell, draw up and forward to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, a resolution calling for a conference of all the Trade Unions, to resist wages outs and formulate a policy.&quot;Comrade Uilligan reported on the activities of the S.W.D0C0 of the Unemployed, and it was decided to again call on the unemployed members of the affiliated branches to get into their local-Committees.   After discussion and in view of the fact that polling day falls on ^hivsdayt December 6th, our statutory meeting mighu, it was agreed to postpone our next meeting till Thursday 20th December,, at 7o-45 p.m*&quot;THE YOUBG COMMUNIST LEAGUEThe Executive Committee of the Young communist League intends to send an organiser to the North SaBt ooast in order to conduct a campaign on behalf of the League among apprentices end other young workers.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINIrish extremists in this country appear to be rallying their forces with a view to obtaining from each Labour candidate a promise that, if returned to parliament, he will:&quot;Work for the withdrawal of the British threat of war which hangs over Ireland, and thereby allow a free vote of the Irish people; and that ho would recogniBe the result of such election.&quot;The question was referred to ths National Executive (Great Britain) of the labour Party, or their Delegate Conference, but, so far, no reply has beon received.   Thovarious/
various Republican Gluts and. Irish self-Determinationleague Branches have therefore Been directed to put questions to ell candidates for election-   These questions are tocentre round the threat of war and if the candidatereplies to the effect that &quot;Britnla has now nothing to do with Southern Ireland&quot; he is to he asked:&quot;Will he oppose British intervention, military or otherwise, if the Irish people by their vote establish an Independent Irish Republic&quot;&apos;Candidates giving affirmative replies are to be supported, all others are to be opposed.In london a special effort is boing made to obtain the support of the Irish vote for ssklatvala and lansbtiry. McHorrough, the London egent for &quot;EIRE&quot;, who is in close touch with the communists hers, has specially asked for the help of members of the Irish Republican Army to &quot;rally the Irish vote in S^klatvala&apos;3 constituency&quot;;     this has probably given rise to 1he alarmist reports of gunmen on the war&apos; path against the Liberal Candidate but there is no real reason for supposing that anything more than the usual rowdy opposition was contemplated *There is very little else of interest in connection with the more open side of the movement:   no meetings of importance took place and there seems to be a very considerable falling off in the number of its supporters.The Irish Republican Prisoners&apos; Dependents&apos; Fund appears to be in a bad way   financially, and a strong appeal for support has been issued from the Dublin Headquarters. In Great Britain three main centres are to be formed; London, Glasgow and Manchester:     Mr, Brian 0&apos;Hsnnigan of Plumstead will take charge of London;   Mr. W.H. Hutchinson (es-Doportee) of Glasgow ana the manager for the time being of &quot;EIRE&quot; of the Manchester centre:   each * rea is to be thoroughly canvassed for subscriptions.
An appeal has also been sent to Arohbishop Mannix in Melbourne for further help in which it is stated that the sum of  1,200 has already been received from that source which came at a time when their resources at home were completely used up.   Their offices were raided, their officers and collectors arrested, and their books and funds seized bj the J?ree Sti;te Government.   Although it is now easier to collect and raise money at home, they are still forced to depend to a large extent, on subscriptions from abroad.    Rutledge, the acting president, also writes in the same strain to the ArohbiBhop appealing for help and sympathy.
