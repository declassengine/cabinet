IphiB document 1b the property of His Britannic Majesty&quot;s Government.)aMEMORANDUM FOR THB HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. - WHITE LEAD. I 3Il9 (23)Home Secretary&apos;s Comments on the Board of trade memorandum.&apos; . -   I think it may be useful for the purpose of the discussion on the White Lead question if I circulate to my colleagues the following brief&apos;comments on the Board of Trade Memorandum (CP.409 (23)).(l) The assumption in the first paragraph of the memorandum is that there is general agreement in the view that lead paint can properly continue to bo allowed for external work subject to regulations.   There is. however, still a strong body of opinion in favour of the prohibition of White Lead for external painting, and those who hold this view accepted the Geneva compromise not because they thought regulations would eliminate all danger, but because ,  they realised that without compromise no progress would be made and that regulations would at any rate roduce the danger.   The Norman Committee accepted the use of lead for external work because they thought that there were no satisfactory substitutes for external painting, - not because they thought the danger could be adequately met by regulations.(2) The argument in paragraph 2 that if regulations are good enough for external painting they should also be good enough for internal work, appears to mo to be fallacious for three main reasons:-   -\ (i) because the danger from dust is groater indoorsthan outdoors;(ii) because tho difficulty of finding satisfactory substitutes for lead paint is less as regards the classes of internal work to which it is proposed under
&apos; ft *i*the Convention to apply prohibition;   and(ill) because the argument ignores the fact that the Geneva Convention is a compromise and assumes that one concession is a ground for another.   The adoption of regulations for outdoor work doos not imply that regulations will be as effective as prohibition in obviating all dangers   tho Geneva compromise only means that internal prohibition plus the proposed regulations represents the most that.is practicable in existing circumstances in the way of reducing the danger.The Board refer to &quot;virtually conclusive evidence&quot; as to the practicability of &quot;completely obviating dry rubbing down&quot; by the use of waterproof sandpaper, but tho &quot;practicability&apos;&apos; depends largely on the question whether the workmen will give up the method to which they are accustomed.   For the reasons given in my memorandum (G.P.394) I cannot share the view that the new process is &quot;easier&quot; and &quot;will be readily adopted&quot;.   From the very nature of the process damp rubbing down necessarily takes longer and is more troublesome to the worker than dry rubbing down.   He must have water, available at his side, he must damp the surface of the paint, and after rubbing down, must &quot;wipe1 the surface., whereas with dry rubbing down, &quot;all the worker has to do is to rub the surface with dry sand paper.    1 feel sure it will be very difficult to induce workmen to change the habit of a lifetime and use the new process consistently.    To ensure the universal adoption of the process would be difficult even if frequent inspection were practicable - which it is not.(3) As to the proportion of paint work which is of an internal character, the Board say at the top of page 7 of their Memorandum that &quot;the most recent information tends to show that between 30 and 40 per cent- of the total is used
for making ir^oOT^p-aints.&quot;    Similar figures were given to me by the White. Lead Manufacturers (based,, as they informed me, on informal inquiries made by the commercial travellers of one of their number on their journeys through the country).   In order to check these figures I asked the representative of the Master Painters&apos; Association to make inquiries of&apos; a number of representative Master Painters, and on the basis of the returns so obtained from all parts of the country, he estimated that if allowance were made for the excepted industrial establishments the reduction in demand, would probably not exceed 15 per cent.(4) On the comment in paragraph 4 that controversy will arise whatever the Governments decision may be, I would point out that if the Government decide to ratify, ;they will be supported not only by the workers but also, by the Master Painters, and will be opposed only by the white lead manufacturers whose position is considerably weakened by &apos;the fact that when at Geneva they accepted the compromise. If the Government decide not to ratify, they will abandon this favourable position, the chance of settloment presented by the Geneva Convention will be lost, and the wholo controversy, including the question of external prohibition, will begin de novo.(5) The argument on page 4 of the Board&apos;s Memorandum that &quot;it is very difficult if not impossible to find a logical basis for the proposed exemptions&quot; and that &quot;owners and tenants of private property would almost certainly make a grievance of having to use a more expensive and.less effective process than that used by the Government and public authorities1!&apos; appears to be due to some misunder-standing.   The basis of the exemption is perfectly clear and definite ** it is that in oertain establishments
9K.56-9.specially unfavourable atmospheric conditions exist which, make it desirable to employ lead paints.    The exception in the Convention for &quot;industrial establishments&quot; is not limited to public authorities.   On the contrary, it will  ; be in favour of private owners rather than of public authorities.(6) In reply to my suggestion that by 1927 leadless paints may have improved, the Board say (last line of page 4) that &quot;their advantages and limitations are now well known&quot;.   The Norman Committee take an entirely different view (see page 36 of their Report), and the Board of Trade have already agreed to the proposal that the Department of Scientific and industrial Research should Bet up a Committee to undertake investigations into problems of paint technology.(7). In paragraph 9   tho Board say that &quot;if they were convinced that the proposed prohibition of White Lead for Internal painting would materially assist in preventing the admittedly serious industrial diseases associated with the use of White Lead, they would warmly support the proposal&quot;.. I myself was impressed by the commercial considerations which can be urged against the proposed prohibition, but . after careful consideration and examination of the question I have been convinced that the proposed prohibition.&quot;would materially assist in preventing the admittedly serious industrial diseases&quot;:    and it is.for this reason.that I -recommend the Cabinet to approve the limited scheme of prohibition accepted by the Geneva Conference..W.O.B.15.10.23.
