THE FINANCIAL POSITION 01? THE COMMUNIST party on October 26th a speoial joint meeting of the Political and Organising Bureaux of the&apos; Communist Party \sas held to examine the financial position of the Party: in consequence of this meeting a confidential statement was sent by the national secretary on October 30th to all district Organisers intimating that, in default of any Immediate improvement in the Party*s finances, District Party Committees would receive no monetary aid whatsoever from headquarters after November 24th:   the districts concerned are London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham, Sheffield, Yorkshire and South Wales.The more interesting passages of the secretary&apos;sstatement are as follows&quot;..,The plans which were recently   adopted with regard to the central Executive Comiitee end the Political Bureau, were based upon hopes of material support which unfortunately have not been realised. Moreover, and apart from this, the general financial position of the Party has been steadily worsening, with the result that the situation now is that a drastic and radical cut in expenditure in all departments of party activity is absolutely imperative if the party is to continue.    We are faoed with the alternatives (a) of immediately reducing our expenditure by at least 50 or 60 per cent, or (b) of witnessing the complete finanoial collapse of the Party within tuo or three weeks. There is obviously nothing to be done but to apply a out immediately, and *at a special meeting that has been held of the Political and Organising Bureaux proposals have been adopted for fiirthwith reducing the expenditure In every department.     In some cases the expenditure will be reduced by more than half; in others it will have to be eliminated entirely. By this means only can we hope to carry on until the end of 1923 and face the new year with anything approaching a clean financial sheet.     Not only have plans for a full-time working political bureau to be abandoned, but the salaries1 list at headquarters has to be reduced to a single sejjretary and the barest possible technical staff.&quot;Under these circumstances, not only is it impossible for the Central Executive Committee to continue the grants made to the district partycommittees/
are/committees on the old basis or on the new lines set out in my letter of October 12th;    but it will also bo impossible to make any grants in future to any district party committee, at any rate so long as the present financial position remains as it is. The most that can be Gone is to continue the weekly grant of  l/lO/a to each district party committee for a further period of four weeks, i*eu up to  end including   the week ending Hovember 24th-.     We see no possibility of any immediate improvement in the general financial position, and we should only bo misleading the 3istrlot party committees if vsq suggested.-.&apos;that there is any likelihood of the grants being, continued beyond that date.&quot;We realise that the cutting off of tho grants will mean a mod if i cat ion in the work of the district party committees, in just the same way as tho economies ef3?eoted at headquarters cannot but modify activity here,     But that simply cannot be helped, and we are sure that the district party committees will rise to the occasion...&quot;The statement concludes with the hope, which seem a unlikely to be fulfilled, that the cessation of financial aid will not impair the work of the Party in the districts concerned.The position in regard to the London District councils set forth in the following announcement made by th*District Party treasurer on November lst:-&quot;At its meeting last night the District Party Committee had under consideration the financial position of the District, from which it appeared that the liabilities stand at  130 and that the income from levies is two pounds per week loss than the cost of maintaining the organiser and-tho district office without taking into account e-ny organising expenditure on postages, stationery, printing, hire of halls, etc.&quot;After careful consideration of the matter it was unanimously decided to give comrade Cent fourteen days1 notice to terminate his engagement as full time organiser.     Nothing short of a miracle ,oan prevent this notice taking effect at the end of the prescribed period and the district has rot to faoe up to the fact that on end after the 17th instant it will be without the services of an organiser.&quot;3ven to pay Comrade Cant up to date will require the sum of  15.     To stave off the evil day any longer will require a serious and sustained financial effort on the part of the locals&apos;such as past experiences have not encouraged the District Committee to look for, much less to hope for.&quot;Other items of expenditure which have been eliminated
are the grant of  2 weekly towards the reduotion ofthe debt on the Greenock nSeerchllght&quot; ana the grantof  1.10 weekly paid to J.J. Donnelly &quot;in oonneotion with    ;the electoral organisation in Ivlotherwell.&quot;The sum of  300, whioh the Communist Party receiveda short time ago for the Lithuanian printing press atBellshill has done little to relieve the financial stringency for, as Deacon, the manager of the Centropress,has informed the Glasgow organiser:-&quot;You see, we had really spent that  300 before we got it.     We borrowed the  100 we sent you some time back, and the expenses of transferring plant to London, re-erecting, etc. aooounted for about another  150.     Still I will not harrow you with details, you know what it is.    We are in a permanent, position of impeouniosity.&quot;Exact details of the officials dismissed fromheadquarters are not yet available but T.A. Jaokson andMinnie Birch, who thinks she &quot;will have to take out abarrel organ&quot;, have had aweek&apos;s notice also, presumably,Tom Bell, who announces his intention of jre turning to Glasgow and living on the dole.     J.R. Wilson, the SouthWales organiser is also making enquiries aboutunemployment benefit to whioh it is doubtful if he is entitled.In connection with the fineness of the Communist Party it is of interest to note that William Gallacher reported, on his return from Germany, that &quot;little or no Importance appeared to be attaohed to the&apos; British movement or the British Party by the Central Committee of the German Party&apos;.&quot; it is not unlikely that, for a time at least,Moscow will confine its subsidy, in so far as the Communist Party of Great Britain is concerned, to grants for &quot;The Workers1 Weekly&quot; and Palme Dutfs group..      This doe3 not, of neoesstty, imply that there will be any marked/
Mlmarked reduction in the money spent by the Third International on subversive movements in this country: it has already been reported that the Plobs league and the labour Research Department, both of which are largely run by communists, are in receipt of Russian money.     There is also a report, as yet unverified, that the Socialist Labour Party has entered   into relation with the Third International through Germany and has signs an agreement under which it will receive a quarterly subsidy for fomenting unrest8 the ultimate, aim of which is the dislocation of British industry. COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA -TO TRADE US1053In view of the discontent and ^strike propaganda&quot; prevalent among certain sections of the railwayman interest attaches to the &quot;Bailment Ail-In Programme&quot; published in &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; dated November 2nd, which covers the following points:-&quot;WAGESA  3 per week minimum for all adults.

General discussion on the need for maintaining close contact with Paris and Berlin and letter read by T. Bell from the secretary of the French Communist Party admitting that a large mea3iire of responsibility for the lack of proper collaboration between the French and British Parties rested upon the shoulders of the French comrades. *PARLIAMENTARY &amp; MUNICIPALLetter reported by Comrade MacManus from the Parsley Local section asking for the name of a Party member, preferably belonging to the Workers&apos; Union, who could be nominated for selection as parliamentary Labour candidate for Pafleay and OtleyLetter reported by MacManus from A.A.

endeavours being made to reduced the present scales of relief allowed to the Unemployed.     In the absence of a meeting of the Political Bureau MacManus had advised Watts in collaboration with 13dgar lansbury, to oppose all efforts to reduce the present scales of reliefj and to throw; upon the Board of Guard iaias the onus of any reductions that were made.UNEMPLOYED ORGAN IS-uTION.Report by Comrade MacManus that the Party Group amongst the London Unemployed had been definitely established and was meeting regularly. Discussion&quot;on the question as to action by the unemployed un connection with the official Armistice Day demonstration on November 10th.Comrade MacMaous&apos; action endorsed.Deoided that steps be taken to      .., bring the Unemployed I to the front in connection with thia / demonstration and to arrange for the matters raised at the meeting whioh respresent stives of the N.U.W.C.M. were to hare with the General council the following week.&quot;The Communist Party &quot;in response to a wide-spreaddemand&quot; has issued a new leaflet entitled &quot;Why you should join the Communist Party&quot;:   in this leaflet, which isquoted below,it is frankly stated that the CommunistParty stands for the abolition of Parliament and theBritish Constitution:-&quot;Why you should join the Cosrounlst Party, (l)   Its objeot i3 your emancipation.The Communist party stands for the complete overthrow of capitalism and tke freedom from the thraldom of wage slavery.(2)   It is concerned only with Workers&apos; Welfare.The Communist Party is a Class Party J-a working-class Party/    The Capitalist, as a class, as opposed to the workers as a class.    We are against the capitalist Class.(3)   It does not pander to worn out Oonstitutiona.The Communist Party honestly and frankly stands for the abolition of the Cepitalist State and all its maohiners, suoh as Parliament and the British Constitution.   These are but iwtrwnent? taken over and develdped by the Capitalist Class in establishing the/
the Dictatorship of Capitalism.   We . stand for the Dictatorship of the Workers.(4)   Its methods are right.The Communist Party works continuously to weld a strong working-class organisation whioh will not only successfully resist the attacks of Capitel ism, but will eventually overthrow it.     It strives to give the Trade Union movement a fighting Policy where weakness is now predominant;it strives for unity in action wheredisunity now prevails.(5)   It is International.Communism is an aim for the World&apos;s workers.     The Communist Party is the only Party which can consistently fight the imperialist alms of Capitalism at home and abroad.Join at onoe.&quot;The Communist Party proposes to extend tho seriesof portraits and biographical details of &quot;Our Fighters&apos;1whioh has been appearing in &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; anfihas Informed local organisations that:-&quot;The purpose of this series has been to help comrades in different parts of the country to get to know other active comrades whom they may not be able to meet.     This is of essential importance in binding the party together.    But to fulfil this, purpose we want to have &amp;3 representative a series as possible of comrades in the fighting line in all parts of the country.&quot;Therefore we are Inviting all locals to send us in photographs and short biographical sketches of members whose work they feel&quot;justifies inolusion. Members should not hold back in this or allow their natural modesty to stand in the way, because it is not a question of their feelings but of the requirements of the Party, and we should exploit to the maximum our personnel, both for the benefit of other members and of non-members (Just as the Russian Party very successfully does).     local P^rty Organisations must make themselves responsible that their selections are really trustworthy members in whom the Party can have full confidence, and the biographical sketahes should stress mainly actual work done in the working class fight, (strikes, unemployed agitation, etc) not just membership or organisations.&quot;Pull results of the munioipal elections in which communists were candidates have not yet been received but Ellen Wilkinson was returned on a labour ticket for Gorton South with 3,341 votes as against 2,501 polledby/
by her conservative opponent;   the Chief Constable of Middlesbrough Informs me that E.W. Eobson polled 974 votes as against 1,677 oast for the liberal and 577 for the Independent candidates.     The Chief Constable of Plymouth Informs mo that George Ebury was defeated by ths Conservative Candidate for Vintry Ward, polling 1,437 votes as against 1,629:   the Chief Constable of Leicester states that the communist, Coxall, polled only&apos; 208 votes out of about 3,500 in a working class Ward.Tho issue of &quot;The Workers1 Weekly&quot; dated November 2nd gives prominence to the sixth anniversary of the Russian revolution and to &quot;the revolution that is coming in Germany.&quot;   Only a few meetings in connection with the Bussian revolution have so far been reported but others are being held this week;   the largest gathering in lend on was held in the Edmonton Town Hall on November 4th and was addressed by Tom Bell, R. Palme Dutt and Minnie Birch, who largely followed the lines , laid dOT?n in &quot;The Workers1 Weekly&quot;.- The Berlin Executive Bureau of the International Workers1 Belief for Soviet Eussia has acknowledged the receipt of  200 from the Communist Party of Great Britain and asked it &quot;to grant all neoessary support to our British Committee in order to enable him the carrying out of its new action in favour of the suffering workers masses of Germany and Japan.&quot;     The Berlin Bureau ha3 applied for and received permission to employ Edgar Whitehead in Berlin as &quot;contributor without any political tasks,&quot;Copies of a pamphlet entit3.ed,TrEussiaIs Economic Future&apos; by C.G. Rakovsky, Official Agent of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics in Great Britain:   reprinted from &apos;Eussian Information and Review&apos; October 27, 1923&quot; and issued by the National Hands Off Russia Committeehave/
m13 -hare been sent to District Organisers of the Communist Party.    The writer concludes his review by 3tating that:-&quot;The Union of Soviet Republics might give work to thousands olTworkers &apos; abroad&quot; IT betweeri It and the flagltalist States &quot;there was restored&quot; normal&apos;&quot;It ia even possible to say without exaggeration that, looking at the eoonoraio chaos prevailing in all Europe, as a result of the woria war, the Union of sovlet Republioa can be pointed out as IIIKsT parts? ffurone with &apos;the most stable economic and  Olitloal s&apos; Wation.&quot;On November 2nd a meeting of &quot;British Pascisti&quot; was held at the Grove, Hammersmith:   some 20 people were present at the commencement but this number was increased to 150 by the looal oommunist unemployed, who interrupted the speakers.    The Union Jack was on the platform and appeared to incense some of the spectators oausing remarks such as &quot;Take that rag down&quot;:   the Red Flag was sung . by the communists when the last sj)aaker left the platform.Helen Cra&quot;-&apos;furd is reported to have left this country for Germany on Hovember 6th  where shs expects to stay for a week.W. Gallaoher had a &quot;sudden oall&quot; to Ireland on October 31st and during his visit was In close contact with Jim Larkin. THB HEP IHTiilRMAT IONAL 0? LABOUR UHIONSThe British Bureau of the Red International ofLabour Unions has not lessened its efforts to obtainsupport for the oommunist programme in regard to Germanyand is making the most of the responses whioh have been favourable to its appeals;   the Dartford Divisional LabourParty, for instance, has informed the Bureau that:-&quot;In order to prevent, if possible, the government of this country using its armed forces to coeroe the German workers, we have formed a committee representing all the various Trades councils and/
end Socialist bodies in this area, on the lines of a Council of Action, to take immediate action in the event of repressive action being attempted by our rulers.This announcement has been sent to &quot;The Worker&quot; in the hope that its publication will encourage other local bodies to adopt a similar policy.The Pinanoe Committee of the British Bureau of the Red International of labour Unions has asked it3 London members to pay their affiliation feees for the period July - December 1923 in order to facilitate the Bureau work.In connection with the Minority Movement Conferencein South Wales mentioned on pages 7 and 6 of last weekTsreport importance attaches to a letter sent by A.J. Cookof the Rhondda Miners1 Federation to A.I. Horners ofthe British Bureau of the Red International of LabourUnions on October 31at:-&quot;After a lengthy debate and great difficulties the J3.C. has decided to call a Conference on November 8th to deal with the Compensation and at that Conference, the wages question will be discussed.&quot;The E.C* felt that it should give the M.F.G.B. another opportunity to make good inasmuch as there have been reductions in practically every district,&quot;Failing the M.F.G.B. South Wales must act so that we must arrange for a further Conference after November 8th.&quot;Mr. Hartshorn in the herald1 to-day (Wednesday) supports our movement as you can see.&quot;I Em going to Rhymney and Trodegar next Sunday.    We must certainly arrange mass meetings in our own district as well.&quot;a (H.B.   iS.C. refers to the Executive Committee of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation).At a meeting of the Glasgow Council of the RedInternational of Labour Unions held at the end of Octoberit was reported by delegates from the unions concerned that, on the whole, steady progress was being made bythe/
the engineers, wood-workers, vehicle builders, boiler makers end railwaymen&apos;s Minority Croups.TESJfffiMPIOYBJ)A number of meetings end processions to Guardians&apos; Offices have been held by the organised unemployed during the past week but otherwise there has been little surface activity:   Hannington is organising the movement in the West of Scotland and the Chief Constable of Glasgow informs me that on November End he addressed an audience of 4 ty 5 hundred in Oaklands Picture House but was very mild in his remarks.The headquarters officials of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement hoped to Lava published the now paper &quot;The Unemployed Worker&quot; on November 10th but so far, the response of local committees to the appeal made for orders for the paper has been small :   only 1,000 copies have been ordered and headquarters state that at least 5C,GG0 must be ordered and paid for before the printer can be approached.There is some talk of a communist-unemployed demonstration in connection With the official celebration of Armistice Lay,&apos; but, as yet, no definite plans appear to have been made.

REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BR IT A INDuring the past week the only event in Irish Self-Determination League oiroles worth recording wasthe/
the meeting in Trafalgar Square on November 4th to protest against the continued imprisonment of 13,000 Irishmen and women in British and Irish prisons and to call for their release:   Brian OzHannipan of woolwich and J.H. Fowler of Richmond, were the chairmen and thechief speakers were Mrs. Skeffington and a Mr. A. Lynnof Lublin.     The latter is a Lublin lawyer who spends a greatdeal of his time defending Republican prisoners and speaksat some of the women&apos;s Meetings which appear to be tolerated by the Free State:   the only remark of notemade by him was to the effect that people were beingmurdered daily in Belfast by order of the BritishGovernment and were being persecuted all over Ire lend.Mrs. Skeffington said that the Republicans did not and.never would respect the partial settlement of theso-called Treaty.    About 1,500 persons were present,but at least two-thirds of these were sight-seers, it being a fine afternoon.Mrs.. Skeffingtonv.&apos;as also to speak at the St. Mungo&apos;s Hall, Glasgow   on November 5th on the same subject.In Scotland the Republican Clubs are showing signs of renewed activity in the direction of publio meetings, etc., but, behind the scenes, the leaders are as disunited as ever:   those who escaped deportation are jealous of those who did not end are trying to get a share of the plunder.      A case in point is that of, Sell MoOrossen who, after getting  265 compensation and Promising to pay  100 of it towards the Republican funds, bolted to America without paying a cent.     A letter has bfcen sent to Republican Headquarters in America to haws him black-balled.
