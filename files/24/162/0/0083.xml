(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BE IT ABU IQ MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) g E 0 H g IO.P. 482(8g) /*Q A B I H Bj I ,* *PROOEBDINGS Of THii) RSOMl MEETING Off THE ^M^JOg^HE LEAGUE Of&quot;^MIQMgj.&apos; &apos; &quot;Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.My colleagues may perhaps oare to have a short aooount of the proceedings at the recent meeting of the Oounoil of the League of Nations at Paris.The agenda was a long one comprising over thirty items A large number of them were more or less formal matters necessitated by the actions of the last Assembly at Geneva, ffor instanoe, the Assembly had asked the Oounoil to reappoint the Temporary Mixed Commission for the Reduotion of Armaments. This was accordingly done.   They had also suggested oertain aotion with regard to the Traffic in Arms and the Private Manufacture of Arms.   There was some difficulty about this since the Departments here   oonoerned with the question were doubtful of the polioy suggested by the-Assembly.   In any oase nothing effeetive oould be done without the concurrence of the United States.   I was glad therefore to accept*a suggestion made by the Rapporteur to postpone further notion till we knew whether the United States would oo-operete, it being understood that this did not mean that we would do nothing if tho United Statos refused. A letter was accordingly sent to the United States Government aaking if it would appoint representatives to discuss the matter fftth the Temporary Mixed OommlB*ion.Other matters obnrieoted with the reduction of Armaments were postponed till the Maroh meeting &apos;of the Council.
The term of office of the members of the GoverningCommission of the Soar 1b annual and they had therefore to b8 re appointed.   It had been arranged that the Danish member who is in reality a Parisian boulevardler. should not continue in office and I waB very anxious -that the Sarrols member should also be changed aa he too was a mere French nominee, one Herr Laud, whereas under the Treaty he clearly ought to be repres-antative of the Baar inhabitants.     After a great deal of privajbe controversy the French discovered that the Council would certainly support the British view - ji decisiomabout the Baar are by a majority - and ultimately agreed to aocept one of the Barrois suggested by me, a certain Herr Hossmann, who is said to command general respect.   . But they were very anxious that the changes Bhould not actually be made till the next meeting of the Council.    To this I agreed on receiving their written promise that they would not then oppose Kossmann.   From March next there will thus no longer be a Frenoh majority .on the Commission Binoe Moltke is also to be then replaced by an impartial person, either Norwegian Spanish or Italian.   The new Canadian, Mr.Stephens Is said to be doing very well.As It carries a salary the*Italians are very anxious to have Moltke1s plaoe and probably it would be well for us to support them,1 though from a strictly Saar point of view the Norwegian would be the best..   Still the Italians shewed themselves so very anxious to be friendly and to wipe out from the minds of their colleagues in the Council the recollection of their Corfu Iniquities
-I 0 c-that it would he perhaps a pity to quench smoking flax.Other matters of importance went well.   The frontier dispute between Poles and Czechs about Jaworzina - a miserable little village of no intrinsic importance    was settled in favour of the Czechs. . After more than two years dispute it had been referred for ftfc advisory opinion to the Hague Court which had advised against the Poles. The council accepted this advice and I hope the matter is now definitely settled.Several questions about minorities in Poland came more or less directly before the Council.   In substance they an arise from the attempts of Germany to Prussianise its Polish provinces before the war.   German colonies were planted about wherever for strategic or economic reasons theyw-ould be useful to the Berlin Government, naturally&quot; the Poles would like to get rid of them, but by the Minorities Treaty they are forced to recognise them as Polish citizens and treat them on an equality with Poles, and the Council is charged to see that this is done.   Two disputes on the subject have already been referred to the Hague Court which has advised against the Poles.   But the Warsaw Government is very recalcitrant and devises measures which are nominally applicable to all Polish citizens alike, but in fact only hit the Germans (and also incidentally the Russians).   One cannot help feeling some sympathy with Polish sentiment on&apos; the subject, but in a state with an enormous proportion, perhaps 45^. of its population non-national in race it is madness for the Poles not to carryout their/
ft. ifTreaty obligations,.   The Council arranged that one of the pending questions should be discussed at Genera between Poles and Germans under the chairmanship of the Brazilian member of the Council,    As to the rest they urged on the Poles not to proceed further with their anti-German   and Russian policy and to compensate those whom they had already wrongfully turned out.     They also appointed a small Committee of the Brazilian, British and Italian members of the Council to watch the further developments of the question.The Ambassadors&apos; Conference, having failed to find -a constitution for the Memel territory satisfactory to the Lithuanians, asked for the assistance of the Counoil under Article 11 of the Covenant, &apos; The difficulty of the position is that the territory by Treaty was assigned to the Principal Allied Powers with a view to their arranging for its permanent administration,     For months and months it was provisionally governed by a Frenoh High Commissioner and a small French force.     Then the Lithuanians turned the Prenoh out and faced the Principal Allies with a fajt accomplii    Except for the port of Memel Itself the territory is worthless and very wisely none of the Powers were prepared to turn the Lithuanians out by force. All they could do was to appeal to the Lithuanian sense of justice, to which&apos; the not ineffective reply was &quot;What about Yilna?&quot;     Finally the Lithuanians agreed to a basis of settlement proposed by the   Ambassadors Conference giving the territory to Lithuania subject to certain safe-guards for the Memel population who ere   mainly Germans. When
however tho Convention oarrying out this agreement was drawn up the Lithuanians objeoted to it and the Ambassadors in despair shovelled the whole dispute on to the League. It was far too detailed a matter for the Oounoil to deal with directly and they therefore have appointed a small technical Oommittee        three presided over by an American to try to draft a new Instrument of Government for the territory.    It is hoped that since there is a large colony of Lithuanians in the United States their oompairiots will not be willing&apos; to reject an American&apos;s advice,    .But the outlook is not very promising and furnishes one more instance of the criminal folly of allowing international questions to hang,about without settlement till they become almost if not quite insoluble.By far the most important business of the Council was the proposal to give to Hungary assistance by way of a re-construotion loan on the same lines as that given to Austria whioh has been so wonderfully successful. . In the case of Hungary, however, the economic situation is so much better than.-it was in Austria that a guarantee of the Powers is not thought necessary for the loan.     for the same reason Prance and the petite Entente are very reluctant to abandon all claim for Reparations.   we had not therefore so much to offer Hungary and it is not yet certain that she will accept our proposals.     They follow generally the lines of the Austrian scheme, the loan being for 250 million gold crowns repayable in 20 years.     We agreed on the terms of a Propoool I,by which all Hungary&apos;s neighbours and the Great Powers bind themselves to respeot Hungarian sovereignty and independence and not to use her difficulties for
their own advantage, Hungary on her side undertakes not to give undue preference to any of them.    We also agreed on the terms, of a Protocol II which sets up a control of Hungarian finance in exchange for the loan.     It was about the terms of the loan itself that the main difficulties aroseand particularly on the question whether during its currency any Reparations were to be paid.     Ultimately it was provisionally agreed that during the first two and a half years,, which is the period allowed for balancing the Hungarian budget called the. recon-struction period^ no reparations are to be paid except that a certain delivery of coal to Serbia worth about 7f million gold crowns per annum Is to continue.    That comes to an end naturally in 1926 just when the reconstruction period also finishes.    Thenceforward not more than 10 million gold crowns per annum are to be paid to cover all Treaty Charges, i*.e,        , oosts of occupation etc. as well as reparations.    But In order to give confidence to the money market it is expressly provided that if the 10 millions are to be paid a special sinking fund of 7-1 million gold crowns may be created which will enable the loan to be repaid in about 15 instead of 20 years.     In that case however no further demand, for reparations beyond the 10 millions is to be made till the end of the 20 years.    All this however has to be approved by the Reparations Corwiission.,   Further certain liens on relief claims - not very Important - have to be released and the little Entente are anxious to Induce Hungary seriously to tackle the many outstanding questions tiiat exist between them - particularly between Hungary and Roumania and Serbia.    At one time&apos; it/
looked as if the little Entente were inolined to make their assent to the transactions depend on Hungary settling theseoutstanding questions as they wished.   But in the end they. Ieaoh made deolarations that all that they wanted was evidence Iof good-will on the part of Hungary. if all goes well the representatives of this country,ffranoo and Italy together with the Little Entente and Hungary IIwho have been made into a   Hungarian Committee of.the Council IIwith full powers are to,meet in London on 16th January when    ;pit is hoped the protocol may he sAgned and tho terms of the loan finally adjusted.   On the whole the Paris proceedings1were very satisfactory and fefleot great credit on thenFinance Committee of the League and on the Secretariat. 1&quot; 1Dr. Benes as usual was very helpful,I trust my oolleagues will agree with me that it isvery desirable that in the above montionod matters theHiresourooe of British diplomaoy may bo employed to baok upBthe aotion of the Counoil.Untd.)
