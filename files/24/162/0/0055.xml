r DOOUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITAOTIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERFMEHT.NUMBERS OF UNEMPLOYED. Note by the Minister of Labour ^ i\JI see that several of my colleagues in recent speeches have given the figures of unemployed as two millions.     This is the figure which has been put forward by critics of the Government, but it is in excess of the real figures.     I hope my colleagues will accept the correct figures from me as follows :-The numbers unemployed as shown by the Employment Exchange Registers are, in round figures - 1,300,000.This figure includes substantially all short-time workers who work three days a week or less.     It is fairly complete at the moment for the insured trades as a new Benefit Year commenoed on 18th October, and no one is on gap.There are a certain number oT unemployed insured persons not counted because for one reason or another th9y have not registered (o.g., because they are affected indirectly by a trade dispute) or who h3,ve gone off the register because they have been put off benefit as not genuinely seeking work or for other reasons.     A figure of 70,000 would be a reasonable ons to allow under this head. *In addition there Is some unemployment amongBt agricultural labourers who are not insured under the Act and usually do not register, and amongst domestic servants,     60,000 agricultural workers and domestic servants are already included in the Registers, and I should estimate a further 80,000 as unemployed and not counted./There
Thero are about 40,000 boys and girls who havo not entered an Insured trade registered at ths Employment Exchanges, but the total number unemployed is certainly greater,    I think we should be safe in saying that not more than another 150,000 aro unemployed.This gives a total not oxcooding 1,600,000,    This in my viow is probably an outside figure.     If instead of thlo an oxaggoratod figure of 2 millions is used it only adds to tho Government&apos;8 difficulties and makos our efforts to deal with tho unemployed appear proportionately less effective.(Intld.) M.B.Ministry of Labour. 12th November, 1925.
