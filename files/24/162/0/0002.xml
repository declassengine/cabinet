the oommuhiststhere are indications that the communist party is considering the possibility of propaganda in thearmy, navy and polioe?   while this policy is inaooordance with the theses of the communist international and is therefore not new,the suggestions of reducedpay are regarded by communists as providing a basis. for more active work:   it 1b moreover reported thatin july last the presidium of the communistinternational discussed communist propaganda in european armies, decided to revise the existing methods and voted a sum of money for propaganda purposes.a well informed correspondent states that thefollowing is an outline of the work which is to be performed by &quot;trusted&quot; oommunists in the london area:&quot;naval end military intelligence:   civil service intelligence;   board of trade:   municipalities.; rural and urban councils;   agriculture;   and all government departments;   any man employed by these bodies to be given every assistance in order to be ready at a moment&apos;s notioe to carry out any instruction issued;   big industrial concerns to be flooded with communist propaganda;   docks; gas companies;   iron and other works;   naval and military towns;   a concise report to be given of all these activities in writing;   looal unemployed to. be furnished with propaganda matter and followed up with continuous offers of help;   the communist international executive to finance the scheme;   communist party of great britain to , spread into every town, organisation and workshop.nthe above is, of course, an ambitious programme which will probably be oarried out in a fSn detailsonly.    at the same time some attempt appears to havebeen made to start propaganda among the forces in theprovinces for the chief constable of hull informs methat:&quot;correspondence has been received by the local branch of the communist party from the headquarters in london to the effect that the government are reducing the wages of all theirservants,/
servants, especially the soldiers, sailors and. police $n&amp; that the party is taking the matter up...Everything possible is to be a one to undermlfle the loyalty of the soldiers;add sailors In the interests of tho Communist Party.The Chief Cons tab It adds that two ex-lieutenants anil en ex-sergeant have taken up the matter j further enquiries are being made.Communist Party leaders and the oommunist pressare devoting a good deal of attention to internationalpolities and more particularly to Germany,   theParty&apos;s attitude was olearly put at a members* meetingat 3aat Ham on September 13th when the nationalorganiser, Harry Pollitt, said that:&quot;The International Executive have reviewed the position of the Party in this country and have found that the Party oan do better than it is doing at present, and we hare got to get right down to work now.    In the first instance, I want to present to you all the importance of doing what you are asked *    You are asked to get into the other political organisations and Trade Unions and become active in these organisations.    So&apos;not stand upon the housetops-and shout:   fI an a Communist.    I am able te stand on my own legs.1 -  This will not do, neither will this do - lose yourselves inside thai ^organisation that you get into.    You must get&quot;all the information you can about things that are causing the rank-and-flie to be dissatisfied.    You will get your orders from us from time to time.    The Executive, in reviewing the International position comes to this oenolusion. No country oan hope to accomplish a revolution proper while this country is under the capitalist Government.    As soon as this country oan de something in the way of attempted revolution, other countries will follow.    This country is the bulwark of the system and other oountries know this, and until we oan shake something up, they will have to remain, more or iosb, in a state of building up their respective Parties.    You have an international position to-day, that if we v;er*. in a position to strike, it would bring the sys&apos;\*m rolling to pieces.    Take Germany, Austria, Spain, and, in faot, all Europe.    You must be ready to take action against this Government shortly, and I mean this and want yout*y
to realise what ia going to happen.     The german working-class are in revolt but are not striding their blew ye to     the fascist! agents have been doing all they could to fcring about a premature revolt;   they have not succeeded and will not.     the german revolution i3 going to happen when we want it (in october or November). We shall have a meet jug on the tth October to define our policy in this..    we must stop this Government from shipping troops or blockading the coasto     this has got to be done by us. Sabotage, if necessary anything, as long as we - can stop them.   Our French comrades will be working with us, end so will Soviet Russia. Donlt lose sight of this feet - we are a small body but we can flo big things if we care to, and we have got to do them.&quot;The Publications Department of the Communist Party has decided to issue an   English edition of &quot;The Communist International&quot; monthly and has asked each District Party Committee to dispose of a certain number regularly:   Manchester has been allotted 80 copies per month.in Jwauary the membership controlled by the West of Scotland District Party Committee consisted of 203 men ana 33 women:   in June the numbers increased to 513 and 43 respectively:   224 members were in trade unions, 47 being miners end 40 engineers. There are now 200 oommunista working as &quot;nuclei&quot; in trade unions (3 of whom are on executive committees)* 67 in the labour Party and 45 in. Trades and labour Councils:   9 ere Parish Councillors, 341 are members of $o-operativa societios:   190 are ex-soldiors and 36 are ex-sailors.    The circulation of literature in the West of Sootland is reported to be &quot;excellent&quot;, only Clydebank and Eilmarnook making-no-headway f   the Vale of Leven has a weekly circulation of 840 papers.   all groups are paying dues easoept Clydobank and Greenpok:on/
on September let the District Party Committee had 93 in hand and the accounts showed a profit of  34(presumably on the quarters working).J.T. Walton Newbold, M.P,, is at loggerheadswith the South Wales organiser with whom he has hadan instructive exchange of correspondence:   writingon September 11th ITewbold said:&quot;I have had 27 meetings in the last 28 days.    You and Brown are the especial limits. Moreover I do not know with whom, without consulting me, you have already arranged everything.&quot;I am having a desperate struggle to supplement my income to offer opportunities for a fund for research and books.     1* have to make a charge for myself end I resent being a mere collector to gather in the sheokels for the D..P.,C.     I must have 12/6 per meeting. If this present arrangement stands S. Wales must go off the list In future.*     I am not in the habit of charging a heavy fee but 1 am not going to be exploited in this way.&quot;In a subsequent letter dated September 15th Hewbold wrote:When I saw yQu I had every reason to anticipate that the Party was going to be able to relievo me of  150 of expenditure),  75 for Donnelly and  75 for researches.     That is now impossible and from somewhere I have to make good that estimated necessary expenditures 9 or go short, not myself or my wife, we have already but down to meet this expenditure, but go short on books of references, papers, 8lue books, etc., absolutely indispensable to the efficient conduct of my work in the house and on the&apos; platform.    Moreover i have required this year to borrow several times end am about  25 in* debt:   something I have never hitherto allowed myself to be except to my own parents? I am trying to clear off this debt, debt for books, bought and not paid for, enough cash to buy myself a set of falso teeth and to increase the number of periodicals I take.     It is only this sharp cut of the  150 which I fully anticipated and which I will not forego so long as it means sacrificed efficiency   that explains my bourgeois tone.    Again I do expect common sense from you chaps, and it is not common sense to bookme/
me up every night, every week, week after week. I have had 27 meetings in the last 28 days and I have 25 in the next 29. I have an insistent clamour from home and abroad for articles. I have two pamphlets in hand."



The South Wales organiser replied to Newbold on September 13th:

"If you had anything to resent in my letters to you I could understand the opening remarks in your bombastic and insolent letter. I did not assume you would disappoint me as far as meetings were concerned, although I know of no special reason why I should rely on you any more than anyone else. Regarding your complaint about piling on work, I was informed in a letter from Com. T. Bell (3 Aug.) that you were available for the S. Wales area from 16 to 23 Sept. There was no limit as to number of meetings you were prepared to address, besides you are not the only party member over-worked, and from what I have seen of you, you are well able to take care of yourself...

"...You have your parliamentary screw of £400 roughly £8 per week, and still you object as from say to gather in the sheckels for the D.P.C. Very interesting. Frankly you ought to be ashamed of yourself to write me about your desperate struggle to supplement your income and your twaddle about being exploited. You don&apos;t know what a desperate struggle to live implies. I do...



"...Regarding your threat that if the present arrangement stand, S. Wales must go off the ? in future, well so far as I am concerned present arrangements or no arrangement, you can please yourself in this connection. Personally I can be depended upon in future not to seek your services whilst you maintain your present attitude."

On September 14th Arthur MacManus arrived at Harwich from the Hock of Holland: he stated that he had been "travelling in Russia&apos;.

Tom Bell is now editor of "The Communist Review". R.N. Postgate, who is now working as a sub-editor of "The Daily Herald" has resigned his membership of the Communist Party owing, it is said, to dissatisfaction with the Executive.

THE UNEMPLOYEDThere are signs of reviving activity among tho unemployed in certain provincial Centres;   a few new committees are being formed end demands are being formulated for presentation to Boards of Guardians.The headquarters of the National unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement appear still to be somewhat disorganised:   two men called in to audit the national accounts have taken exception to the method of book-keeping.    The national committee has refused to give a list of the newspaper agents to the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions and has &quot;opened up conversations&quot; with the printers with a view to re-starting the paper.The Scottish Western District Council of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement considers its Organisation to be in a &quot;healthy state&quot;: affiliated Ocranitteea took 6,900 pence cards during the period from August 4th io September 4th. THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUEThe Young Cpmmunist League intends to hold a national conference, probably in Ooteberi   the national secretary, William Rust, intends to tour^ the Scottish branches beforehand, in order to consolidate the re-organisation begun by H. Young and expects to reach Glasgow on September 26th.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINIrish extremists in Great Britain are particularly quiet just now.    Most of the leaders appear to be, ( .,chiefly/
chiefly concerned as to how much they are going td getas compensation for being deported:   a  meetingof London Deportees was held at 84, Blackfriare Roadon September 18th to consider an offer said to havebeen made by the Treasury:   a similar meeting was held onthe same day at the Central Hall, Bath Street, Glasgow.A well informed correspondent predicts a certain liveliness after the Deportees have received their compensation money.Irishmen here say that the Republicans, having secured victories quite beyond their expectations at the General election, are now planning a big campaign to secure control of the local bodies at the next local Government election.An Ard Fheis. or Supreme Council of Sinn Fein, has been summoned to meet in dublin on October 16th.the irish Republican league of Great Britain continues to hold meetings and is receiving a certain .1 amount of support from communist and unemployed organisers:   its speakers make it quite clear that they are out for a workers Republic on comsimnistic lines*the old irish self-determination league and Irish republican army members still hold aloof:   indeed some of them&apos;&apos;questics the right of wilkinson and his friends to represent the republican cause here and interrupt his meetings..     they intend keeping an eye on him end if necessary will take action:   he admits that he is still without official recognition from headquarters but hopes to get it ssortsly.   An attemptwill/
will be made to raise funds by means of dances, etc., at Cheater&apos;a Academy, Shepherd!s Bush:   there is a growing suspicion that these young blackguards are out to feather their own nest.In Glasgow the same condition of affairs prevails, disputes are the order of the day:   the Sinn Fein Clubs are quarrelling among themselves end with the National i&amp;cecutive Council.     The Irish Republican Army is in a state of mutiny, as too many want to ba leaders.
