(TOIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT) . S E C R E T.fj,P.  S9  (50). COPY NO.CABINET. UNEMPLOYMENT    INSURANCE    BILL.Statement by the Lord President of the Council on the amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Bill made in the House of Lords.The House of Lords made two very important amendments to this Bill, which was sent back to the House of Commons last night.      The first is a new clause 4;  and the second limits the operation of the Bill to one year from the 1st April next.      In each case I indicated in the Hou.se that the Government could accept no amendments of this kind.It depends on the decision of the Speaker of the House of Commons whether these amendments entrench on the privilege of the House of Commons.      In any case, I imagine that the House of Commons will return the Bill in the form in which they passed, it in December.      If the Bill is sent back to the House of Lords in its original form, the House will probably not disagree.      If there should be disagreement, however, it would be a case where, in my opinion,  there should be no compromise.In order that matters may be in train, I propose that the House of Lords should sit On Thursday night until the Bill returns from the House of Commons.      It will then be possible for the Bill to be reconsidered on Monday of next week, and, if the House of Commons
amendments are accepted, it should be possible for the Royal Commission giving Royal Assent to take place on Tuesday, 4th February.Should the amendments from the House of Commons not be accepted, the question will arise for decision by the Cabinet.(Sgd.)      PAHvLOOR.28th January,  1930.
