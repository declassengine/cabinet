I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] D DPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1930. .......SECRET.CP. 19 (30).CABINET.Speech to be delivered by the GoYernor-General of India on 25th January 1930 at the formal opening of the Indian Legislature.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I think ray colleagues will be interested to read the substance of the speech which Lord Irwin proposes to deliver on Saturday next. In the existing situation in India, whether regarded in relation to the critical stage reached in the constitutional development of the &quot; Indian Empire&quot; or in relation to the threat of imminent widespread civil disobedience, a Viceregal speech on so formal an occasion cannot fail to be of great importance ; and it is of course more than likely that some of his utterances will become the target of criticism here, whether in Parliament or in the Press. The Governor-General&apos;s responsibility must be shared by the Government at home, and, if for this reason only, I thiuk it proper that my colleagues should know beforehand the substance of Lord Irwin&apos;s speech, even though it contains nothing that can be described as in any way new.Lord Irwin sent me by mail a first, and admittedly provisional, draft of his speech. He followed this with a telegram indicating certain alterations. These have been incorporated in the draft set out below in the right-hand column. It will be noticed that though the greater portion of the draft speech as I have it is in the form of the actual words to be used, there are passages which only indicate the general substance ; but it will, of course, be understood that even where the &quot; actual words &quot; are given, Lord Irwin may very likely make alterations before the speech is delivered. In the left-hand column I have set out certain amendments of detail, some of them of importance, which I have suggested in response to his invitation for comment.Apart from these I have suggested to him certain comments of substance in relation particularly to the passages marked A, B and C : A. I have suggested in general terms that there maybe a risk of subsequent misunderstandings involved by too definitive a statement now as to the probable procedure to be adopted at the Conference, even the date of which, though approximately known, cannot yet be stated with certainty. This risk applies particularly, as I have indicated to Lord Irwin, to the analogy drawn between the Indian Conference and the Imperial Conference, from . which the inference might be drawn by too optimistic Indians that the representatives of India at the former will stand in the same relation to His Majesty&apos;s Government as those of the Dominions at the latter, and that agreements may be concluded in the same manner at the former as at the latter.B and C. Though unity is unquestionably the essential condition for the advancement of India constitutionally, and though it is desirable that this should be stated plainly, there is a certain risk that a Viceregal exhortation to unity, delivered in close connection Avitb references to the impending-constitutional Conference, may give rise to expectations that if at the Conference the representatives of British India at any rate present a united front, they will automatically obtain from His Majesty&apos;s Government and from Parliament all that they may demand. To this risk also I have drawn the Viceroy&apos;s attention.I have also suggested that he might insert at the appropriate point a reference to the resolution of the Congress forecasting the repudiation of India&apos;s debts, which appears to haAre contributed directly to the present depression of Indian Government securities.It will be seen, therefore, that the speech is still subject to considerable amendment; but though it is so far from its final shape, I have thought it desirable for the reasons given above to let my colleagues knoAv at once the substance of what Lord Irwin proposes to say next Saturday.I need hardly add that if any points occur to my colleagues in regard to which they think it advisable that a suggestion should be conveyed to Lord Irwin, even at this late stage in the preparation of his speech, I should give such suggestions 1113&apos; careful consideration.W. B.18th January 1930. 4250      75   1.30
Read:  &quot;&quot;&quot;j;^.1: .: - &quot; after the Uepoft &quot;of Sir &apos; &apos; John Simon&apos;s Commission had been considered.&quot;Tins sentence should be altered to make it plain that Sir. John Simon&apos; was not responsible for the declara-tion of constitutionalpurpose that Dominion status is the goal: i - &apos;&quot; On my return to this country from England, it was my duty to make a statement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. That statement, as was inevitable, has been the subject of close analysis and some criticisms both here and in Great Britain. Upon the criticism that has been made upon it in Great Britain I am obviously debarred from commenting, except for one observation which I think I am both entitled and obliged to make. In the light of the appreciation which I had formed of the principal elements of the problem with which we all have to deal, and with a full knowledge of the weight that must necessarily attach to the considered opinion of anyone holding my present office, I should have felt that I had failed in my duty both in India and Great Britain, if I had tendered any different advice to His Majesty&apos;s Government; and when His Majesty&apos;s Government saw fit, as they did, to enjoin me to make an announcement on their behalf, I could have chosen no different language in which to make it. But while my position precludes me from referring in detail to what has been said elsewhere, it compels . me to deal more specifically with some of the implications of my statement from the point of view of India. In particular; I am bound to ensure that nothing which I may say should in any way confuse or mislead opinion here ; for i realise far too clearly the harm that can be thus wrought to British Indian relations willingly to allow any utterance of mine to be the vehicle of such misunderstanding.&quot;The intention of my statement, of which I believe the purport to have been unmistakable, and which carried the full authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government, was to. focus attention&apos; oh tlmee salient points. Firstly, while saying that obviously no; British Government could prejudge the; policy which it would recommend to Parliament -after:-. Sir John-&apos;&apos;!Simon &apos;s Commission had reported, it declared in unequivocal terms the goal to which British policy in regard to India was directed. Secondly, it repeated Sir John Simon&apos;s assertion of what everyone knows to be the fact, that this constitutional purpose compels us to make a constructive attempt to face the problem of the Indian States; and lastly it intimated the intention of Flis Majesty&apos;s Government to convene a Conference on these matters ^before they themselves might appear in any way to prejudge them by formulation of even draft conclusions.&quot;I have never sought to delude Indian opinion into the belief that a definition of purpose, however plainly stated, would by itself, by the enunciation of a phrase, do any-thmgto solve the problems which have to be solved before that purpose is accomplished.. The assertion of a goal, however precise its term, is of necessity a different thing from the goaPs attainment. No sensible traveller would feel&quot;,that the clear definition- of his destination was the&quot;&apos; saffte: thing as /the completion of his journey. But it is&apos; ah assurance of direction, and in this case I believe it to be- something of. tangible value to India that those who &quot;demand Dominion status on her behalf should know&quot; that Great Britain on her side&quot; also desires to lend her assistance to India in attaining to a position
The substitution of &quot; In-dian leaders&quot; or some such phrase is suggested, as the phrase used may by impli-cation cast aspersion on those, e.g. the members of the Indian Central Com-mittee, who have already -co-operated.of full equality with the other self-governing units of the British Commonwealth. Unity of purpose is thus assured and enables us to approach the practical difficulties with greater hopefulness. For my own part, if I am satisfied that someone with whom I have business to transact desires the same end as myself, I feel the better able to discuss any honest difference that may emerge between us as to the means of its attainment with a feeling of confidence that on the main purpose we do not differ.&quot; The demand for Dominion status that is now made on behalf of India is based upon the general claim to be free from the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government, more especially in those fields that are regarded as of predominantly domestic interest to India. And here, as is generally recognised, there are real difficulties internal to India, peculiar to her circumstances and world position, that have to be faced, and in regard to which there may be sharp variation of opinion both in India and in Great Britain. The existence of these difficulties will not be disputed, and the whole object of the Conference now proposed is to afford opportunity to His Majesty&apos;s Government of examining in free consultation with those who can speak on behalf of India how they may best and most rapidly and most surely be surmounted.&quot;The Conference which His Majesty&apos;s Government will convene is not indeed the Conference that those have demanded who claimed that its duty shortld be to proceed by way of majority vote to the fashioning of an Indian -constitution which should thereafter be accepted unchanged by Parliament. It is evident that any such procedure would be impracticable and impossible of reconciliation with the constitutional responsibility that must rest both on His Majesty&apos;s Government and upon Parliament. But though the Conference cannot assume the duty that naturally appertains to His Majesty&apos;s Government, it will be convened for the purpose, hardly less important, of elucidating and harmonising opinion, and so affording guidance to His Majesty&apos;s Government on whom the responsibility must subsequently devolve of drafting proposals for the consideration of Parliament. The Indian Conference, I suppose, will therefore proceed much on the lines of Imperial Conferences, where without formal voting subjects are discussed either in full Conference or in the first instance hy sub-committees reporting back to the main Conference, and thereafter the general sense, of opinion expressed and the measure of agreement reached is recorded. It is thus evident that the intrinsic soundness of any particular proposals made, and the manner in which the argument for them is presented, will be more important factors in the Conference than the exact numerical representation enjoyed by any of the different, sections of opinion that will participate in the proceedings.&quot;I do not now pronounce between the alternative methods by which the British Indian side of the Conference might be established. It is safe to assume that the only desire of. His Majesty&apos;s Government will
This passage is to be modified, at the suggestion of the Dominions Office, to some such words as &quot;It appears probable that the Imperial Conference will be held in the autumn of this year,&quot; as the date is, in fact, not yet fixed, still less publicly announced.This sentence is subject to the Prime Ministers concurrence.be that this body should, so far as it may, be honestly and fairly representative of all opinion in India which can legitimately claim to be heard. While those who compose it should clearly be men who command the full confidence of those they represent, I trust that they will also be men of wide vision, strong judgment aud imbued with the single desire of utilising the occasion for the common good of all the people of India. I have as yet tendered no advice to His Majesty&apos;s Government on this matter of composition of the Conference, and before doing so I shall welcome any informal intimation of their views that Honourable Members of the Legislature, or spokesmen of different interests in the country may be willing to place before me.&quot; Nor has it yet been possible to decide upon a date-for the Conference, for this must depend upon certain factors -which are still indefinite. Arrangements hare already been made to hold the Imperial Conference in the latter part of September and this, no doubt, will have to be one of the considerations present to the mind of His Majesty&apos;s Government when they fix the date for the Indian Conference. And, as I stated in my announce-ment, after the publication of the Report of the Statutory Commission, it will be necessary to give His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Government of India, Local Govern-ments, the Princes and general public opinion, reasonable time to study the complicated questions with which the Report will deal. Subject to these practical necessities of fact, His Majesty&apos;s Government will desire to hold the Indian Conference as early as possible ; and so far as they are concerned, will interpose no avoidable delay. It is further the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government to meet, in so far as it is possible, the wishes and convenience of Indian repre-sentatives themselves in this matter; and it will therefore be valuable to me to have the views of Honoirrable Members and others on this point also.&quot;I refer to my announcement of last May foreshadowing the extension of Assembly on the ground that it was undesirable to hold elections on the eve of Simon&apos;s Report and then refer to my decision to extend Assembly to 31st July so as to leave it open to decide the date of election later, as may be generally con-venient, having regard to the date finally fixed for the Conference.&quot;Let us picture to ourselves a Conference, such as we-may aspire to see established, in actual operation. It Avill be an assemblage of men of varying race, religion and political thought ; it will, by the inclusion of the Indian States, be both an expression of the practical links at present uniting the two parts of India and, as we may hope, an augury of the greater unity that future days may come to witness ; at the Conference, table, along with all those representatives of India, will&apos; be those who represent Great Britain, and in view of the unique character of the gathering, I would hope that, when his other preoccupations may permit, it might be possible for the Prime Minister to preside in person over its deliberations. -Those taking part in the proceedings will be free to press any case that they may desire to advance, and have the opportunity of discussing all
The words be omitted.in brackets toBB&quot; It is evident that there are already some who regard violence* cotof mobs, asproblems. Between such persons in ordered society based upon the respect  for property and   othersolvent of political and all who believe sanctity of life and lawful   rights  and&apos;interests, there can be no composition and no truce. And although the very authors of the present policy deprecate, some on grounds of principle and some on of expedience, resort to violence, they cangroundssuggestions, from whatever quarter they may emanate, with complete liberty [and on terms of complete equality]. They will do this, if I may repeat the words of my announcement &apos; in the light of all the material then available&apos; a definition purposely drawn wide enough to ensure to the Conference every latitude and assistance in the responsible task on which it will be engaged. The action of His Majesty&apos;s Government may fairly be said to have created a new situation. If the funda-mental problem; remains the same, their action affords to India, as it does to Great Britain, the occasion of making a new approach to it, under conditions honour-able to all, and in such form as should permit every type of opinion to contribute to its solution.&quot;I then say that I had hoped for unanimity in accepting the hand of friendship, but that it seems that some are going to allow the opportunity to slip, and I add that the future well-being of India depends more on her public men welding the different elements into true unity than upon anything His Majesty&apos;s Government can do. I go on to speak of the futility of the destructive methods which India has already seen in operation.I finish by laying emphasis on two points: first, &quot;I have striven hard, not, I think, without result, to secure recognition of what I felt to be the just claim of India at the hands of Great Britain, and, at the same time, to pursue a policy of day-to-day administration in India that might not needlessly imperil any chance there might be of guiding the ship carrying a precious freight of India&apos;s future into smoother waters. Rating-very highly, as I do, the necessity of avoiding any needless aggravation of a problem already difficult enough, it has not been the policy of my Government that prosecutions for seditious speeches should be extended beyond those cases where the actual language used, or the circumstances of its employment, constituted an incitement to violence or rendered it necessaiy to regard it as incidental to a movement directed to the subversion of law and of the authority of Government. It has recently been announced that the immediate goal of some who claim to represent India is repudiation of allegiance to British Crown. It has further been made clear that those who desire to achieve that goal contemplate resorting to the unconstitutional and unlawful methods of civil disobedience. I am confident that the great preponderance of Indian opinion, which is both loyal and sane, wall, when it understands its implications, reject a programme which could only be accomplished through the subversion of the Government by law established.
chardly be so lacking in either imagination or recollection of past events in India as not to be able to. picture the results in this direction which must follow, as they have always followed, from the adoption of the policy they recommend. It remains my firm desire, as it is that of His Majesty&apos;s Government, following the recently professed wish of the British House of Commons, to do everything that is possible for conciliation in order that Great Britain and India may collaborate together in finding the solution of our present difficulties. But it is no less my duty to make it plain that I shall not hesitate, if need be, to use whatever powers I or my Government may command in the discharge of the responsibility imposed upon us for the effective preservation of law and order in India.&quot;Secondly, the Conference will take its appointed course and His Majesty&apos;s Government will not be deflected from their declared intentions to call representatives of India to their counsels. I lay emphasis on the necessity of Indian opinion finding expression with something like unanimity. I end: &quot;I would accordingly hope most earnestly leaders of all those who will be repre-sented at the Conference may realise that no duty to which love of their Motherland may impel them can transcend in dignity or worth this call to unity, and that they may utilise wisely the interval before the Con-ference in training the ears of their countiynien to hear it.&quot;
