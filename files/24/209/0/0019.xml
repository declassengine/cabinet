TEGUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT). C^R^T.tO (30). Copy Ho.       34___CABINET.SINGAPORE BASE - MALAY STATES CONTRIBUTION MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST USED OF THE ADMIRALTY,I shall he glad if the Cabinet will consider the implications cf the present suspension of the payment of the Malay States c&amp;ntributitsn to Singapore Base (see CO. telegram nos..  C.I. 5 (3S) and 6&apos; (30),  contained in an Appendix to this Memorandum), distributed from Offices of the Cabinet on 2nd January.What has happened is that,  upon the decision of the Cabinet last November to slow up work on the Base as much as possible pending the results of the Naval Conference,  the Colonial Office expressed doubts whether the question of suspending this contribution should not be raised.    The Admiralty, being consulted,  advised that thez^e was no necessity for raising the question, as suoh slowing down as was Involved Toy the decision would net affect the date of completion of the scheme and no decision on the scheme as a whole and its date of completion had been taken.      The expenditure on the Base during the current financial year would also be fully up to the amount provided in the Navy Estima tes.Nevertheless,  the Colonial Office, without further consultation with the other Departments concerned, oame to a decision to withhold the contribution, which was waiting in the hands of the Crown Agents for the Colonies, -pending the consent of the High Commissioner of the Malay States to paymont.The /
The High Commissioner, not unnaturally in view of such signs of hesitancy, has replied, that before agreeing to payment he must obtain the concurrence of the Rulers and the Federal Council,  and has asked whether he shall do sooHow,  therefore, we are in this dilemmaeIf payment of the contribution during the next ten weeks cannot be counted upon, a Supplementary Estimate for the Navy, which otherwise may quite possibly be avoided,  will be a necessity.,    The deficit must be explained as resulting from the loss of the Malay money, and an embarrassing debate on Singapore, in the very middle of the Naval Conference, will probably result.On the other hand,  a discussion in Malaya as to whether the consideration for the contribution has failed or no is only slightly less undesirable, and without the presence of anyone capable of explaining our position, it might not have the desired effect.I cannot help feeling that the present difficulty has arisen without adequate cause, and probably therefore through misunderstanding, particularly as no similar difficulty arose when the late Cabinet actually deferred the date of completion of the Base from 1934 to 1937.The High Commissioner has already been Informed that no decision has been taken on the scheme as a whole and its date of completion, which date 3tands and will not be affected by the precautionary slowing down of work pending the Naval Conference.     His proposal therefore to withhold -he contribution in advance of any suoh decision seems inexplicable, unless he regards it also as precautionary, on the&apos; assumption that any money now paid will be lost in the event of the results of the Naval Conf erenne--leading to an abandonment of the scheme.In /
1 Q 9In all our discussions, however, on Singapore, it has (I think) been accepted that if we closed down on the soheme *r fundamentally altered it, we could not resist the obligation either to refund the contributions we have reoeived it to make some equitable arrangement with regard to them, as might be mutually arranged.     Such precautionary action, therefore, on the part of the High Commissioner is really unnecessary.I suggest that with the view of solving the present difficulty a further telegram should be sent to him from the Colonial Office in the following sense:&quot;Have referred your telegram of 1st January to &quot;H.M*Government who think position oannct be fully &quot;understood.    Ho decision has been taken affecting &quot;scope of scheme or date of completion.    The precau-&quot;tionary slowing down of work pending Naval Conference &quot;can have no effect on that date.    Decision to with-&quot;hold contribution,  therefore, appears premature unless &quot;it is precautionary on supposition that money would &quot;be lost in the evefat^of results of Naval Conference &quot;leading to entire change of policy regarding Base. &quot;On this I am to assure you that H.M. Government &quot;reoognise that if scheme were abandoned or altered &quot;fundamentally contributions would hav&quot;e to be refunded &quot;or adjusted as might be mutually agreed,    in those &quot;oiroumstanoes it is thought no question of consulta-&quot;tion with Rulers or Federal Council about present &quot;payment need arise.    In opinion of H.M.Government &quot;it would be very undesirable for such a disoussion &quot;en Base to arise in Malaya while Naval Conference is &quot;sitting and still more undesirable to have parliamentary &quot;debate here as would be unavoidable if contribution &quot;actually budgetted for is not received&quot;.AN 1930A.
