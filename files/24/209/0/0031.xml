&quot;    261TT^DQCUl-KNT IB TICS PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAhNIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) ....OQPY NO ^3P    32(301.&quot; CABINET.  -UNB?.TPLOYIi5NT    POLICY memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.Our colleague, Sir Oswald Mosiey, after many discussions with us on the subject of unemployment and the Government&apos;s failure to reduce the figures, decided to spend a portion of the Christmas vacation summarising our views and experiences, and also putting on record in skeleton form the sort of organisation and some of the steps which,  in his judgment, are necessary if we are to deal effectively with this, the most vital of all domestic questions now before the country.I have read his detailed examination of the present situation, and his criticisms of our present schemes for dealing with the problem, and, without pledging myself to everything contained in the memorandum, I must record the fact that I am in substantial agreement with him and do most earnestly beg the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal to give their best and early attention to the memorandum prepared by our colleague.In asking tnat this should be done I want to assure the Lord Privy Seal that our disagreements with him have no shape or shadow of personal feeling,  each of us,  at public meetings, and to deputations, have done our utmost to strengthen his hands,  to explain his policy and ensure its success.    I, however, believe that the limits within which he is working have set him an impossible task and am firmly convinced that the road we are now travelling affords no kind of immediate or even early amelioration of our country&apos;s economic plight.      The Lord Privy Seal has worked1.
day and. night and done all that one man could do within the limits he and his advisers have decided to work, hut 1 believe that these limitations of present policy forbid success.holding the views we do,  to ask that the memorandum of ourcolleague shall receive the consideration it deserves.I hope that time will be found for tho Prime Minister andthe Lord Privy Seal to discuss with Sir Oswald Mosley inas full a manner as possible the present position inregard to unemployment and the proposals in relation theretoput forward by the Chancellor of the Duchy.In these circumstances feel it is our duty,Office of24th January, 1930.
