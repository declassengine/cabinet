THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.&apos;Printed for the Cabinet.   February. 1930.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.     33CP. 48 (30).CABINET.THE PROVISION OF AN AERODROME ABOVE THE NEW CHARINGCROSS RAILWAY STATION.Note by the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Transport.AT their meeting on the 6th November last (Cabinet 45 (29)), the Cabinet decided that the feasibility of the proposal put forward in CP. 302 (29) for the construction of an aerodrome above the new Charing Cross Railway Station should be further investigated; and that; if the scheme at Charing Cross should prove impracticable, alternative sites, such as Liverpool Street, should be examined.This action has now been taken and we circulate herewith, for our colleagues&apos; information, a memorandum which establishes that serious financial and technical difficulties are involved, which render the Charing Cross project impracticable. We concur in the conclusions reached in this memorandum. It will be seen that Waterloo is equally ruled out; and a preliminary investigation indicates that, apart from the other difficulties, the area available at Liverpool Street would be insufficient, even if Broad Street were included.T.H. M.February 10, 1930.MEMORANDUM.THE practicability of constructing an aerodrome above the proposed new Charing Cross Railway Station has been explored by representatives of the Air Ministry, the Ministry of Transport and the Southern Railway Company.It is understood that, to give effect to such a scheme, it would be essential to provide a circular area with a minimum diameter of 400 yards. After careful examination the conclusion was reached that the roof area of the new station would be inadequate for this purpose, and that it would be equally impossible to utilise the combined areas of the site of the new station and the site which is being acquired between the new bridge and the County Hall.Consideration was then given to the question whether it would be possible to erect an aerodrome over the new Charing Cross Station and Waterloo Station combined. It appeared, however, that the two sites are not situated in positions which would render it convenient for them to be used for such a purpose, and, further, that any such scheme would involve the approach roads alongside the station being roofed over for a considerable distance, which is open to objection from an architectural point of view.The possibility of constructing an aerodrome over the existing Waterloo Station, and certain adjoining properties, most of which, if not all, belong to the Southern Railway Company, was next discussed.It was intimated on behalf of the Air Ministry that the landing stage of the aerodrome should be capable of carrying an aircraft weighing up to 20,000 lbs., [20582]
which would probably involve an impact weight of 60,000 lbs. on landing, and that it would be necessary for the landing platform to be at least 100 ft. above the ground. The Engineer of the Southern Railway explained that the foundations in this neighbourhood are very bad, the Railway Company having already had to go down to a depth of 40 ft. below river level in order to get suitable foundations. He thought that, having regard to the great weight of any such structure as an aerodrome and the strength required for the landing platform, grave difficulties might arise in constructing it, apart from the fact that the roof would necessitate very strong supports at very close intervals. Moreover, serious trouble might be experienced in finding sites for such supports, having regard to the railway tracks and platforms at Waterloo Station and the tube stations thereunder. The supports would, in his view, have to be of steel, and heavy maintenance charges would be involved.Assuming such a scheme to be practicable, he estimated that the cost would not be less than  5,000,000.It was agreed that the Engineer to the Southern Railway should go into the matter further, and his later letter will be found in the appendix to this memorandum.It will be seen that he confirms that the estimated cost will not be less than  5,000,000, and that, apart from cost, technical difficulties would be encountered in erecting such a structure over Waterloo Station.In the circumstances1 it does not appear that the matter can be usefully pursued.Sir Herbert Walker stated quite definitely that the Railway Company would not be prepared to promote such a scheme or take any financial interest in it. In their view, it could not be an economic proposition. Further, they considered that the construction of such an aerodrome would greatly depreciate the value of properties in the neighbourhood.
APPENDIX.Letter from the Chief Engineer to the Southern Railway on the proposal to constructan Aerodrome over Waterloo Station.Engineers Office,Waterloo Station, S.E, 1, Dear Sir, December 9, 1929.PROPOSED Aerodrome over Waterloo Station.With reference to the meeting which took place at your office on the 21st ultimo, I have now considered further the proposal to construct an Aeroplane Landing Station over the existing Waterloo Station, and would make the following observations thereon : Owing to the height of the structure I am of opinion that in order to reduce the dead weight it would not be feasible to build the same in ferro-concrete, but a steel structure would have to be resorted to.There would be great difficulty in finding sites for suitable supports to the proposed Aerodrome owing to the existence of the railway tracks and platforms of Waterloo Station and the Tube Stations underneath.It is not possible at this stage without going into a great deal of detail, to say whether the scheme is a practicable one on the site proposed, but assuming that it is, I estimate the approximate cost of the work would not be less than  5,000,000 (five million pounds). The employment of steelwork for the structural portion of the Aerodrome would also result in very heavy maintenance charges being incurred for the periodical painting which would be necessary.In considering this matter I have come to the conclusion that a site removed from the railway premises would be more economical owing to the difficulties which would be entailed in finding space for the foundations of the supports.Yours faithfully, (Signed) G. ELLSON.Sir C. W. Hurcomb, K.B.E., C.B., Permanent Secretary,Ministry of Transport,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.
