(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS&apos; BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S gMeRNMENT).GAB I H E T.gjLGJULT. COPXJo. /CP. 49(30)The Indian Budget:   Cotton Tariff Proposals.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate a copy of a private telegram received to-day from Lord Irv/in, conveying the reply of the Government of India to the message approved by the Cabinet at its meeting on Friday, 7th February.    (Reference Cabinet 9(30), Conclusion 2 and Appendix.)W.B.13th February 1930.Telegram from Viceroy, dated 12th February 1930. -     (Received 13th February 1930).Private and personal.   Your private and personal telegram of 8th instant, 480.    I discussed Cabinet decision with my Council to-day, and we are deeply impressed by a message of this nature.    Nevertheless, we fear that there are insuperable difficulties in modifying our plans on lines suggested.It must be remembered, firstly, that we want revenue;    secondly, that customs is our chief source; thirdly, that general revenue tariff stands at 15 per cent, while duty on cotton piece goods is 11 per cent.; ;fourthly, that Indian industry is suffering from (corrupt group)depression
depression, and that, as regards Bombay, mills are approaching a desperate position which may affect the whole future of this place, which is main centre of Indian commerce and industry.The history of cotton duties in this country is an unfortunate one, and has perhaps, more than any other single policy, helped to provide material for those who represent British as exploiters of India.    In a year like the present, when we have to impose heavy new taxation, we could not for revenue purposes leave cotton duties alone.As regards raising cost to consumer, we believe that in those goods for which we chiefly wish to exclude foreign competitors, namely, plain grey shirtings and light sheetings and the cheaper coloured goods, internal competition will in any case keep prices down.    As regards bleached goods, which are still a Lancashire monopoly, and the finer qualities of grey and coloured goods, which Lancashire mainly supplies, the purchasers are not mostly the poorest classes, and a four per cent, increase in price cannot be represented as a crushing burden.    Its effect is equivalent to that of only a very moderate change in price of cotton, and it will probably, according to past experience be off-set by a corresponding decline in consumption. I recognise that even a  four per cent, drop in Lancashire markets is a serious matter, but it is not disastrous, and in any case we are bound to put Indian interests first.As regards second point in Cabinet decision, the damage to British interests, I recognise how important it is in Indian interests not to antagonise British opinion and quite apart from this we are of course deeply concerned to avoid unnecessary damage.   V/e have carefully consideredv/hat
what we could do in this respect, and we are prepared to propose to the Legislative Assembly that, in addition to a 15 per cent, revenue duty, a 5 Pe^ cent, protective duty, with a minimum of      annas per pound on plain errey goods from outside the British Empire.This would ih fact suit Bombay interests, and there is just a chance that it might pass Legislative Assembly.   We must make it quite clear that we could not go so far as to force this measure through, against a strong unofficial opposition in Assembly even though we might be temporarily able to snatch a majority.   We should have to be guided by general indications of public opinion.     We would not ask them to commit themselves to Imperial preference as a principle but merely to adopt this course for dealing with present circumstances and for giving a response to the appeal made by British Government which has a historic significance as being made exactly in the same&quot;manner as that Government might have appealed to any of the Dominions. We should propose protective duty for three years only, and undertake to have its effects examined by Tariff Board before end of this period.   We believe, taking a long view, such a course would represent the best way of helping British interests.   These must realise that it is quite impossible to resist Indian demand for full development of their own industries that even if we do not raise general duty now, it is inconceivable it will not have to be raised in the next few years, and then demand may be for a still higher figure. The best that Lancashire can hope for is to get maximum share of demandfor
for piece goods which India herself cannot supply, and that at least will be helped by our proposal. There is a strong underlying desire among Indians to-day for protections and if we starve it altogether, we shall create a dangerous political situation.   XJe recognise that Bombay mill owners are themselves much to blame for their present condition, but that does not alter the fact that this condition is now so bad that they cannot extricate themselves from it without some Government help. V/e cannot afford to stand by and do nothing.&apos;  I should be glad if you could put these suggestions very urgently before tine Cabinet for we must know finally at latest by 20th February whether we are to proceed with it.If we are to adopt this course, I should propose that the facts of His Majesty&apos;s Government1s approach to Government of India as a Dominion Government, and of our previous proposals and ultimate response, should be fully and frankly explained in budget speech.    I deprecate, however, idea of actual publication of telegrams exchanged. If publication is necessary, I suggest that reference in Cabinet decision to Indian consumers&apos; interests would be better omitted.   The Indian Legislatures and Indian public will think that this is their affair, and will be inclined to mistrust His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s solicitude, though they will of course bo only too ready to use the argument about consumers&apos; interests to aggravate our difficulties.
