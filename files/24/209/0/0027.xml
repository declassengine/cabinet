THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet,   January 1930.SECEET.O.P. 28 (30).CABINET.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE AND ECONOMIC CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.AT their meeting of the 15th January (Cabinet 2 (30), Item 4) the Cabinet agreed inter alia that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should endeavour to arrange for the meeting of an Imperial Economic Committee in the weeks immediately preceding the holding of the Imperial Conference, the Committee to prepare a series of reports on economic subjects for the consideration of the main Conference. I have now discussed this aspect of the arrangements with the President of the Board of Trade, who was unable to be present at the Cabinet meeting when this conclusion was reached, and he has pointed out that there would be serious difficulty in carrying out this proposal. He himself is to attend the meeting of the League Assembly early in September, and it is impossible for him to forecast how long he may have to remain at Geneva. In any case, the adoption of the proposal would give him no leisure to prepare for the Imperial Conference after the League meeting was over. When the conclusion was reached that the opening date of the Conference would most appropriately be the 30th September, one of the governing considerations was that it was felt that it would be inconvenient for the Conference to meet earlier owing to the League Assembly.The experience of 1926 showed that the arrangement then adopted, i.e., that by which a special Committee to deal with economic questions was set up at the outset of the Imperial Conference, gave rise to no difficulties or delays, as economic questions were satisfactorily disposed of in ample time for their consideration by the full Conference, which, in the meantime, was fully occupied in dealing with political issues.Finally, it will be remembered that there was some difficulty in securing unanimous agreement among the Dominion Governments for the opening&quot; date of the Imperial Conference. If a proposal for an earlier meeting of an Economic Committee is now put forward, it might mean reopening the question of the date of the main Conference. For the above reasons I would ask the Cabinet to reconsider the matter.P.Dominions Office, January 27, 1930.Copy No.33[20501]
