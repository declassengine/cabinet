IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIN MIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.COPY HO.   Q CABINET. :TRADE OUT LOOK: REPORTS RECEIVED FROM MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL    (JANUARY 1930).-    ...     r    ....     - --   -     .... .     -, . .     .... -- ,.   ,, -i .n i    mm   .Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.The general burden of the report is on the whole not unsatisfactory though apprehension is expressed generally as to the Coal Bill and the Budget,The Coal Report is good, there being a strong demand from both home and abroad though not beyond the next month or two; uncertainty after this is attributed to foreign buyers holding off on account of Coal Bill uncertainties.      It may be added that the total export of coal for 1929 was 60,000,000 tons against 50,000,000 for 1928;    railway receipts from coal and coke show the remarkable Increase of  2,923,000 or 8,75%.Iron and steel exports for 1929 (4,379,000 tons) show a slight advance on 1928, while imports are slightly less In weight and slightly more In value.     Steel production in the United Kingdom in 1929 reached the highest figure except for 1917 and was nearly 10,000,000 tons (out of a world total of 120,000,000 tons).     The comparatively satisfactory nature of these figures however Is stated not to be reflected in the Companies&apos; balance sheets.     For 1930 the outlook depends on the course of coal prices resulting from the Coal Bill and on shipbuilding,     Fairly full employment In both shipbuilding and engineering is visible till the early spring.The position in the electrical industry is being adversely affected by conditions in several industries at home and by depression or hostile tariffs abroad.      In the motor IndustryT.4(30).
there is uncertainty in view of the Budget hut a satisfactory feature is that commercial vehicle factories are busy.For cotton both the retrospect and the outlook are depressing,     Far Eastern conditions being particularly adverse, and elsewhere rising tariffs create difficulties.     The position for wool is no better, but some satisfaction is derived from the conviction that wool prices which have been falling continuously since March 1928 can hardly go much lower. The hosiery trade complains of increased imports of cheap cotton goods,In the chemical trade imports during 1929 increased 10%: exports less than 5%, and foreign competition Is steadily growing.     Special attention is called to the position of nitrogenous fertilisers, where as In the case of so many other commodities over-production is the trouble.      (United Kingdom, exports were high however in 1929).The dyestuffs industry continues to make progress.The produce markets show no marked features.      Co-operative business has been normal.      In general distributive trade in goods of greater value the second half of the past year showed a falling off indicative of decreased purchasing power which continued for the Christmas trade.     No general recovery is expected, at least until after the Budget.The total Railway receipts for 1929 show an Increase over 1928 of .72$ due to coal traffic;    passenger railway receipts show a decrease of 2.73% attributable to road traffio competition.In the money market the increase in the Bank of England&apos;s gold stock and the reduction of the Bank Rate manifest the general improvement, but the Stock exchange markets are likely to remain depressed until the Hatry settlement has been
effected and the outlook   for ooal and other Important industries has become more settled.     &apos;The December fluctuations in the number of registered unemployed were later than usual, the usual pre-ChrIstvnaa fall not having shown itself until December 16th when it was only, slight  (6,CCO as against 124,000 in 1928).     This  Is chiefly attributable to bad weather and to some Increase of unemployment In coal and cotton.     The post-Christmas rise (at December 50th) was not itself so high as usual, but on balance unemployment Increased more than in 1928 or 1927. The total figure for December 30th was 1,510,231 (which by January 6th was reduced to 1,478,800);    as compared with 1,520,730  (and 1,452,619) a year ago.     The total number of insured persons employed at mid-December 1929 estimated at 10,159,200 exceeded the corresponding figure for December 1928 (10,058,900).Board of Trade,30th January, 1930.

COAL.PROM Mil. RIDLEY WARHAM.The weekly output of coal in the United Kingdom for the three weeks ended Deoember Slat was as under:Week ended December 7th   -   5,507,000 tons &quot;        &quot; &quot;        14th    -   5,399,000      K&quot;        w n        Slst    -    5,647,000      &quot;The average of eight weeks ended December 21st was 5,372,000 tons, as compared with 4,962,000 tons for the corresponding period last year, and a weekly average of 5,526,000 tons in 1913.The number of persons employed in the industry for the week ended December 21st was 949,400, equal to 85.5$ of the 1913 figure.Unemployment for the month of November was 14.3$, as compared with 15.5% in October and 21.9$ average of 1928.The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom (excluding Irish Free Statel during November was 5,197,544r tone, as compared with 5,514,731 tons In October.    The average price per ton f.o.b. in November was the same as October, viz., 16/5.Exports by sea from Poland show a desrease in November as compared with October, the figures being:October    -   742,000 tons November -    694,000    &quot;The demand for coal for both home and export continues very strong for present delivery and for the next month or two. Foreign buyers, however, are still holding off for later in the year on account of the uncertainty in connection with the coal Bill now before the House of Commons.FROM SIR WALTER RAINS.In Durham, full work was maintained during December, exoepting during the third week, when the continued Westerly gales seriously delayed arrivals of tonnage.    Consequently, some Collieries were laid idle for a day or two.   The Collieries have all their available output booked for the next two or three weeks.   After that, the position is uncertain.    Buyers are hesitating, because they wish to see the outcome of the Coal Mines Bill now before Parliament.   The foreign buyer is of the opinion that British Coal Export is to receive a Subsidy.    It is reported that would-be Scandinavian purchasers are withholding orders, in the hope of receiving reduced offers owing to the supposed Subsidy coming into effect as soon as the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament.
CONFIDENTIAL. COAL (CONTDi jIt may be of interest to record that the French Railways have purchased larger quantities than usual    of German Coals   for 1930.    An important French Factory, which consumes 2/3,000 tons of Coals per week, enquired recently from Germany and the North of England for an extra cargo of coals per month for the first quarter of this year. English Exporters replied immediately with very favourable offers, whilst the Germans mentioned a prioe which was higher than that from this country, but would not promise to supply. The French buyer kept the English waiting for over a fortnight, because he stated quite definitely he intended to purchase German Coal if it was obtainable, as he was afraid of a possible stoppage in Great Britain.IRON AND STEEL.FROi,i MR.  BOND.Production and foreign trade figures for December are not yet available but it is clear that the recent falling off in demand, together with tbe Christmas holidays, will result in a substantially lower steel production in December than that ruling in the last few months.    The total steel production for the year will be in the neighbourhood of 9,650,000 tons which is higher than in any previous year except 1917 when, under the war stimulus, our output reached 9,716,000 tons.     This increased production has naturally involved an increased production of pig iron which will, it is estimated, amount to 7,500,000 tone, a figure higher than in any post-war years except 1920 but considerably below our pre-war output.    Imports of iron and steel for the year ?/ill probably amount to 2,750,000 tons, or about 140,000 tons less than in 1928, while exports of iron and steel will be in the neighbourhood of 4,400,000 tons and thus will be slightly higher than for 1927 or 1928, though still half a million tons lees than in 1913.On the surface, therefore, it would appear that the position of the iron and steel industry is better&quot;than a year ago, but unfortunately figures of production do not connote a corresponding improvement in tho fundamental position of the industry.      Prices have risen slightly during the year but this is due not so much to the improved demand as to the increases which took place in. the prices of raw materials.     The increased cost due to tho increased prices of raw materials has precluded the balance sheets of Iron and steel oompanies from showing any marked improvement over fchOBe of previous years.     As has been frequently pointed out in these monthly reports muoh nf the improved position as far as production is concerned has been due to
IRON AND STEEL (OONTD.).the fact that the Continent has been working nearly to oapaoity but the demand on the Continent fell off during October and tho Steel Cartel ordered a restriction of production by 10 per cent, from the 1st November last.Markets are naturally quiet at this season of the year and it is difficult to predict the course of the industry for 1930.   Much will depend upon developments in the shipbuilding industry at home and in Continental countries but even more will depend upon the course of coal prices consequent upon the Governments Coal Measure.    Should this result in any substantial increase in the price of fuel it cannot but have very serious repercussions on the iron and steel Industry. It is therefore essential that steps shall be taken either in the Coal Bill itself, or by some agreement outside the Bill, that the price of coal should not be raised to the iron and steel industry and that fuel sold for shipment for the iron and stoel industry abroad shall not be sold to our competitors at a less cost than Is supplied to the industry a home.Estimates are now available of the total world production-tion of iron and steel for 1929 and they suggest a very definite step forward in the economic recovery from tho war, for production both of pig iron and of steel is higher than in any previous year.    World production of pig iron will amount to about 97 million tons or 10,000,000 tons more than in 1928, while steel production will amount to 120 million tons or 12 million tons more than in 1928.    High taxation for social services, high transport rates, and other factors beyond the control of the industry make it Impossible for Great Britain to produce steel at a price to enable her to obtain her fair share in the increasing world demand.    One of the most important factors militating against Great Britain in this competition is undoubtedly the spasmodic flooding of her home market by Continental steel at very low prices.    The present importation of Sheet Bars to South WaleB at a price of  5 a ton delivered Welsh Ports is resulting in the closing of some Steel Works and in others working at only about 70 per cent, of capacity.NON-FERROUS METALS.FROM CAPTAIN LYTTLETON.Copper:    Buyers of Electro continue to hold off In the hopes of lower prices, and there is little doubt-that the high level maintain ad by the c opjjer Exporters Ino. is having a bad effect on consumption everywhere, and where possible substitutes are being resorted to.       In the North Wiredrawers are not too well occupied and In Lancashire some stocks are accumulating.
NON-EBRROUS METALS.  (0 ONTD.)Lead.     Sheet, Pipe, Solder and other smaller miscellaneous trades remain quiet and below normal. Motors, however, are busy and better than for the same period last year; this should reflect favourably on Battery makers.     It is some time since Cable Makers were so short of orders for Lead covered Cable, and we hear that there is one Works In the North which has found it necessary to lay off some 200 men.     Some improvement, however, is expected shortly.Zinc.     Troubles in China and unrest in India have adversely affected the export trade and makers of galvanised sheets continue to have a lean time.    In the Swansea area Works are badly off for orders, and In some cases where considerable stocks are being carried, It has been decided to close until these can be disposed of.SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING-.ERQM sir WALTER RAINE.Shipbuilders and Engineers are very busy, and it is pleasing to state that several new orders have been given out recently, which has relieved the position somewhat.      It appears as If there will be fairly full employment in these two trades, at any rate, till the early Spring.      Of course, some of the Yards and Engine Shops have been fortunate enough to book sufficient orders to keep themselves occupied for some months ahead.Shiprepairing seems to be very active, both on the East and West Coasts.The uncertainty which is showing itself in the Coal Trade is undoubtedly Infecting other Trades, and the whole situation may be summed up in a single sentence - there is a distinct feeling of hesitation.PROM MR. RICHMOND.Although the year 1929 shows a slight decrease of 35,154 I.H.P.  compared with 1928, it still represents a satisfactory output made up for the most part of engines for vessels of normal type and moderate horse-power.     In comparison with other countries, .we still maintain a conspicuous lead with an output of 1,872,667 I.H.P. although as an individual unit, the North German Lloyds Steamer &quot;BREMEN&quot; of 85,000 I.H.P. takes pride of place over any vessel^ equipment here.
SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING (OQNTD.)Marine engineering is essentially an unsheltered industry - It has to meet the world market, and its success or failure is largely conditioned hy the success or failure of our shipbuilding industry to which it Is ancillary.     That in a world competitive market with the various disabilities which affect the industry, we have been able to make such a satisfactory show, indicates a power of recuperation and an efficiency which is most encouraging.      Its dependence, as noted, on shipbuilding, makes It somewhat difficult to segregate the special factors affecting it.     The absence, however, of any serious labour disputes during the year has greatly contributed to the satisfactory result of 1929.The recurring question of domestic as against foreign competition cannot be ignored as one of the main factors in keeping prices at an unremunerative level,  and during the year the shipowner has obtained his propelling machinery on terms which, in many cases, have left no margin for the engineer.     With the excess of facilities both in engineering and in shipbuilding, this condition of affairs  cannot be regarded as for the ultimate good of the industry,  and the necessity for combination and reorganisation is being felt by a number of establishments.      If increased efficiency in production and lowering of costs form the basis and objective of such proposals, a sound foundation is assured, but mere aggregation in itself will do little to improve the situation.The year starts with a satisfactory quantity of work in hand in the various centres, but the outlook has factors which discourage optimism.- Employment, however, should be maintained until well through the Spring.In Scotland in general engineering, unemployment is heaviest in the constructional section and smallest in marine engineering.      In the railway and locomotive workshops, business   has improved and. prospects are: fairly satisfactory.     Tool makers appear to be well employed.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.FROM SIR HUGO HIRST.At the time of submitting the last report (in October) the demand for electrical material had been well maintained throughout the country, although a greater improvement had taken place in London than in the Provinces.     This improvement continued up to the early part of November, but since then conditions have not been so good and a general deterioration in business has taken place.Contributory factors have undoubtedly been the depreciation of values on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges, and the disturbing effect on many industrfes
ELEOTRIOAL INDUSTRY (CONTINUED ).of the possibility of new legislation.      In the /artificial Silk Industry for example, one important producing mill which was on the point of doubling Its plant has now Indefinitely postponed the scheme.The difficult position of South Wales, has become worse, due to the disorganisation of the coalfield area by the severe storms and bad weather of the last two months of 1929.     The possibility of the closing down permanently of an Important Steel Works in Monraouth would affect not only the electrical demand but the general community; as a large proportion of the population depend on the Works in question for their livelihood.Reports from the Midlands indicate that the Light Iron and Steel manufacturers are doing reasonably well, but the heavier Steel Industry Is quiet.      In the Collieries, there is a marked disposition to go slow, and defer any schemes of extensions to plant, etc.On the North East Coast; Collieries are fairly busy, and Shipbuilding moderately so.     The general position of the Steel Industry is better than twelve months ago.The Electrical trade in Lancashire has suffered a slump and enquiries and orders have dropped off.     A number of leading contractors are short of work, and for the time being the outlook is depressing.In Yorkshire, last year closed under difficult industrial conditions in the Woollen trade, whilst the Mining Industry is marking time until stability is reached.     These conditions have had a marked effect on the sals of electrical apparatus and commodities.No further contracts of any magnitude have been placed under the Grid Scheme * since the last report, and returns of orders placed in the heavy section of the electrical industry all shew a decrease as compared with the previous year.     The biggest decrease Is in Turbines, and Turbo-Generators, but other sections such as large Dynamos and Motors, Converting Plant, etc., are similarly affected.The demand for electrical material Overseas, particularly In the Colonies, has Increased during the past year, particularly for such material as power cable and telephone exchange equipment, but ,the present situation is one cf some difficulty on account of political and other causes in different parts of the World.In China, trade has  again been shattered by a further-outbreak of military activities, and the depression In the Rubber and Tin Industries of the Malay States has decreased the demand for electrical material.* i.e, the Scheme for systems of high tension electric power mains,
. CONFIDENTIAL.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY  (CONTIiiUED ) .Above all, the new tariffs Lmposed in Australia have dealt a big blow at electrical manufacturers exporting to that market.     The duties recently imposed and those that are forecast will practically mean the closing of that market for all electrical material which is or can be made in Australia, and whilst these tariffs affect other countries as well as Great Britain, the effect of this legislation is none the less severe to the home manufacturer.The slump In values on the Stock Exchanges throughout the World will probably also have an effect on Export markets, as exporting countries will ho doubt endeavour to make up for falling home consumption by dumping goods in other territories.MOTOR INDUSTRY,FROM SIR WILLIAM MORRIS.In common with some other trades, the month of December is usually a quiet one with the motor industry owing to the cessation of work consequent upon the Christmas holidays.1.    In the Coventry area, unemployment figures have increased more than seasonally. There is certainly further evidence of a growing feeling of doubt,2,    Import of cars in November-December haveshewn a substantial decrease, and this may be due to the uncertainty of the tariff position in regard to the Budget, as well as excessive stocks accumulated during the past few months.3. I am informed that, in certain cases, Car Agents are not, even at this early date, taking delivery in accordance with contracts,4.    Commercial vehicle factories, generallyspeaking, are busy, many branches working overtime.PROM sir CYRIL HURCOMB,.The number of motor vehicles  (excluding Motor Cycles ) newly registered in October 1929 was 435 more than In October 1928;    there was a decrease in the number of cars taxed, on horse power, but a further substantial increase in goods vehicles:-

October, 1928, and a decrease of 118 compared with October, 1927.COTTON.FROM SIR KENNETH D, STEWART.The year 1929 has oontinued to be a depressing one for the Cotton Trade.   During the year there has been a great deal of short time working in factories.   Even the more favoured Egyptian Section found it necessary to go on short time for three months.During the year two efforts at re-organlzing the Trade from a manufacturing point of view have been put in &apos; action through the formation of the Combined Egyptian -Mills Ltd., controlling 3,000,000 Spindles, and the Lancashire Cotton Corporation Ltd.,   The latter is still in course of organization, and will, probably, control about 10,000,000 Spindles.The annual exports seem to have stabilized themselves round about four-thousand million yards as against seven thousand million yards in 1913.    There are signs that even this smaller total Is diminishing as exports for the last three years have shown symptons of falling off.The Indian market, which is the largest and most Important, appears to be suffering in competition not only with local productions, but also with competition with Japan, which increased In severity in 1929 to a marked extent.CHINA!&apos; has been a very poor market for various reasons. &quot;The two most important are the state of unrest and the low level to which silver, which is used for currency in that country, has fallen.
COTTON      (CONTD.)With regard to tb/vse two markets, there are no very encouraging signs.    In the case of India, dominion status or increased independence means permission to protect themselves against our goods as well as Japanese goods in the eyes of many of the most articulate of their politicians.   It la difficult to see any very hopeful signs in China at present.Most other markets are in a somewhat more encouraging condition than these two, though the plague of continually rising harriers of duties menace the Trade almost everywhere one looks.WOOL.FROM MR. HAMILTON.December 1929 marked another sharp fall in wool values. Since March 1928, twentyone months ago, the downward trend of wool prices has been almost unbroken, and it may now be stated that in the main markets of origin, Australia and the Cape, fine wool is selling at approximately pre-war prices.The slump has affected principally merino combing wools which are used for the production of fine worsteds, and it is only during recent months that the -oo&amp;rser combing wools have been severely affected.     Short wools and by-products, which are the main raw materials for the woollen trade, also maintained their values fairly well until recently, when the slump began to affect them sympathetically.Whatever may be the fate of the woollen and worsted trades during 1930, there is some satisfaction in knowing that anything in the nature of a further heavy slump in prices is impossible.During December, as always happens, there was a dual movement.   On the one hand there was a movement of a full week prior to Christmas to enable a full week&apos;3 wage to be given to the workers, and, on the other hand, a slackening off at the beginning of the month in the Woollen end of the Industry.   This is most curious and has happened for many years.It is probably due to the fact that in September and October there is an overlapping of the tail end of the Woollen Winter season with the beginning of the VJorsted Spring season.The Woollen end falls off definitely in December and the Worsted end begins about that time, and this last December has proved no exception to the rule.There is no evidence yet that the state of depression has altered and especially is this borne out by the machinery aotivity.
WOOL (CONTINUED).There has been a slight improvement (which Is seasonal) in the Worsted end. and also in the light Woollen trade, but the heavier Woollen trade has fallen rapidly.HOSIERY.FROM MR. WALKER.Although certain sections of the trade have been busy and even certain areas have done better than others, 1929 must generally be considered a disappointing year as far as the Hosiery trade is concerned.Unemployment figures shew that there has been more unemployment, but these figures do not really give a true indication of the state of trade, for throughout the trade a great deal more short time has been worked in the past year.The Import and Export figures also bear out the contention that 1929 has been disappointing.      Imports have been greater, Exports have been smaller.     The imports of Hosiery during the eleven months ending November amount to  4,67 5,207 against  3,956,605 in the corresponding period of 1928, the principal increase being one of  666,206 in Cotton Stockings and Hose, the total value of goods of this class entering the country being  1,725,371, while over a million pounds worth of cotton underwear was imported.The importation of these cheap cotton goods, both stockings and underwear,  is significant as shewing that,with the reduced purchasing power of the public,more cheap merchandise is imported from abroad, unfortunately at prices with which this country cannot compete,Exports dropped from  6,145,576 to  5,905,465.      It is interesting to note, however, that Silk hose Increased by  21,812, and it is significant also that the Importation of Silk Hosiery is  63,270 less than the previous year.     The full fashioned real Silk Hose trade indeed,  is the one portion of the trade that has remained consistently good throughout the year.Whilst in Leicester districts complaints have been general throughout the year that trade has been disappointing, reports from Nottingham have been consistently better, and in reviewing the prospects as far as Nottingham is concerned, a recent report states that prospects for 1930 are distinctly brighter, and the summer underwear season lias opened most favourably, orders having been received for quite substantial quantities.
HOSIERY.     (CQTTD. )This    optimistic report would certainly not bs borns out by other centres.      Reports from Hinckley especially have been consistently bad since August;    probably Hinckley is suffering more than most districts at the present time, but reports from Loughborough state that short time is being worked all round, unemployment is worse than a year a^o,  and much worse than a month ago.All districts complain that the raising of the Australian tariff is seriously affecting all branches of the industry;      The almost entire closing of what was at one time the biggest export market for the hosiery trade must have a serious effect on unemployment In the industry.CHEMICALS.FROM MR.  HILL.Summarizing the position In the Chemical Industry during the past year,    it is difficult to express exact views regarding production since production statistics for the chemical industry as a  hole do not exist.      The Association of British Chemical Vanufacturers has the matter in hand, however,  and a number of schemes in different sections of the industry are in progress which it Is hoped will improve the position in the future.      The index of production has shown a steady Increase throughout the year, the figures for the three quarters being 107.2, 112.9, and 117.5 respectively,  as compared with 110.3 for 1928.    This increase is all the more gratifying since it has been achieved in spite of the continued depression in many of the chemical-consuming Industries such as the textile and other industries,  as reported a month ago.Unemployment figures are not so satisfactory, the percentage of Insured unemployed since August being in the neighbourhood of 6.5 as compared with 5.9 in October, 1928.Th9 imports for 1929 are about 10% higher than in 1928. The upward trend of the exports in 1928 was not maintained, and several timis   dropped below the 1928 level.      Up to the end of October exports were slightly ahead of the corresponding period in 1928.While the year&apos;s activities may in some directions give cause for satisfaction,  the Indications for the future are by no means reassuring.      We are not securing that share of foreign trade which is essential for the proper development of the Industry, and we are facing steadily growing competition in practically every market, even inside the British Lmpirs.
C CNF IDENTIAL-CHEMICALS.     (C ONTD. )I may draw attention to the recently published Annual Report of the British Sulphate of Ammonia Federation, covering the year ending June 30th, 1929.      This report gives an admirable review of the position as regards nitrogenous fertilisers,  the following being a few noteworthy points:-1. In view of the unsatisfactory economic positionof farmers in many lands,, the increase of 230,000 tons of nitrogen in the world&apos;s consumption during the year under review must be regarded as satisfactory.2, Chilean nitrate absorbed about 12% of this increase,  and the remaining 88$ fell to sulphate of ammonia and other forms of nitrogen.3. The most notable increase in consumption tookplace in the United States of America, Northern Europe, and the Japanese Empire-4. Selling prices during the year for synthetic formsof nitrogen were only slightly below the level for 1927-8, but there was a reduction of about 10$ for Chilean nitrate.5. For 1929-30 prices for all forms of nitrogen havebeen reduced by about 10;i.6. The significant feature to be observed in the-   nitrogen statistics for the past year is the tendency for production to outrun consumption.7. For 1929-30 a further considerable increase in production is expected;    estimates varying from 2S0, 000 to 400,000 tons of nitrogen,      An increase of about 22$ in consumption Is required to absorb the lower of the above two fig-ares together with the stock carried forward from last year-8. Concerted efforts on the part cf the many groupsproducing nitrogen will be required if consumption is to be maintained at this high level.While propaganda work to encourage the use cf fertilizers is actively in hand in this and other countries,  there is nevertheless a great danger of a serious overproduction of nitrogenous compounds in the world,  and new outlets must be sought and developed if the British manufacture is to continue its progress.The dye stuffs section of the industry, has    continued its steady progress, in spite of the depressed conditions in the textile industry-      The output this year is likely to exceed that in 1928, which was the highest ever attained in this country.      The progress made is evidenced by the fact that considerable extensions to works and plant are in course of construction.
QHEMIOALS  (CONTD.).The export trade also shows an increase, and up to the end of October the exports both as regards weight and value are greater than for the whole of 1928.    Imports have also increased by about 20$ as regards weight and 10$ as regards value;    and it is interesting to note that for 1929 the value of the exports exceeds that of the imports^-.    The quantity exported is much greater than that imported, due to the fact that only certain specialities which have as yet no counter-part here are imported, resulting in higher prices being paid for them by British colour users.Substantial price reductions have been effected during the year, and the price factor has been lowered from 2 to 1.75 by the Dyestuffs Advisory Licensing Committee.Technical developments have proceeded at a satisfactory rate, and many new dyestuffs have been placed on the market by British manufacturers;    some of them being of considerable importance inasmuch as they have filled gaps in the available range, which formerly had to be supplemented by importation, under licence, of corresponding products of foreign origin.The Wood Distillation industry is passing through the most critical period of its history.    Its by-products such as acetic acid, methyl alcohol, and acetone, are now being produced by new processes at home, or are imported at prices with which the wood distillation industry cannot economically compete,     Production costs, owing chiefly to the prevailing high rates of wages, are higher than in foreign countries;  and competition is rendered still more difficult on account of the higher prices demanded in this country for waste wood and of the higher transport charges.       For these reasons several wood-distillation firms have been forced into liquidation.The industry is further hampered by the importation of foreign wood charcoal offered at prices which,  in many cases, are below the cost of production in this country.     New processes are being tested with a view to improving the position, but altogether the outlook in this industry is gloomy.THE MONEY MARKET.FROM SIR GUY GRANET.The improvement in the Paris and New York Exchanges which commenced in the early part of December was maintained for the greater part of the month, with the result that gold shipments to France have been verv much reduced and shipments from. New York to London amounting to about  4,700,000 have been effected&quot;, which,  together--with shipments from other sources, nave brougm, the Bank of England&apos;s stock of gold up to  146,000,000 aooording to the Return of January 1st.*This is not quite borne out by the official figures whioh are experts (l) products of coal tar  984,222 (2) other sorts  102,907, = total  1,087,129;    imports finished dyestuffs from coal tar  1,097,371.
THE MONEY MARKET  (OONTD.)*On December 12th the Court of the Bank of England reduced the Bank Rate from 5%fo to 5fi.     Their action was rather a surprise for the Discount Market which, although it had already discounted suoh a reduction in the Market rate, did not anticipate any change until the gold which has since arrived from Hew York was actually in the vaults of the Bank of England.     The Court, however, took advantage of their knowledge of impending large shipments and decided to lower the official rate without delay.     The inflow of gold has eased the position of the Money Market and its discount rate for three months bills has fallen to 4^, which is the market quotation for an effective Bank Rate of 4i?&amp;, to which figure the official rate may possibly be reduced in the near future.       Rates for Call loans have also fallen since the end of December sinking as low as 2-g$ at one period. It is expected, however, that when the repayment of the loans borrowed from the Bank of England by the Discount Market to finance it over the turn of the year has been effected, and the seasonal inflow of taxation Revenue and the payment of the final instalment due on 5?o Conversion Loan has been made, the se movements will absorb any superfluous funds and cause money rates to become firmer.The improvement in monetary conditions has not been reflooted in the general markets of the Stock Exchange, and the state   &quot;of the Industrial and speculative markets such as Oil, Rubber and Mining shares through lack of Interest on the part of the general body of investors Is very depressed. The prospects of an improvement in the near future are not regarded as very encouraging.   Confidence has undoubtedly been badly shaken by recent events at home and abroad and there is little sign of any return of support for industrial and commercial Investments, in fact it is not expected there will be much change in the Stock Markets until the Hatry settlement has been effected, and the economic outlook of the Coal and other Important industries becomes more settled. The above oconomio factors also militate against new issues of capital and consequently there has not been any offering of importance recently.GENERAL TRADE.Co-operation Trade.FROM MR,  HAYHURST.I have nothing of special feature to record in regard to our trading operations during the month of December except to state that, as compared with the corresponding month of 1928, we show a slight increase in sales. -Business during the period has beentypical of that generally associated with the Christmas
GENERAL TRADE (CONTINUED)&apos;.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (CONTINUED ),season.      Everything has flowed through normal channels, and whilst, perhaps, in one or two certain directions there may have been slight delays owing to transport congestion, we have no reason to complain of the manner in which our traffic generally has been handled.      The business of the 3anking Section too has been of a satisfactory character.Grocery and Provisions^BUTTER. - In the middle of the month Danish butter suffered a fairly large reduction in price which, with its corresponding reduction In the retail charge, made the latter approximately 4d. per lb, lower than at the corresponding period of last year. Anticipation of a better consumptive demand did not, however, materialise owing,  it Is stated, to the fact that Germany had large supplies of cheaper foodstuffs, whilst in London and the south of England generally, Colonials ruled the market.      At the close of the month, however, the Danish market finished with more steadiness,the &quot;official&quot; quotation remaining unchanged.There have been heavy arrivals of New Zealand and Australian butters which, however, cleared fairly well with prices ruling easy,CHEESE. - The market for New Zealand has continued in buyers1 favour, prices easing somewhat at the end of the month. There has been a good demand for Canadian and prices have been well maintained.      The demand for Lancashire and Cheshire has been on the quiet side, probably due to the holidays, buyers having purchased well in hand4SUGAR- Business has been rather on the quiet side with prices fairly steady up to the end of the month when refined advanced 3d, per cwt.WHEAT, - Liverpool futures, at the end of the month, closed about 3d.&quot; per quarter lower on the particular week, Chicago and Winnipeg closing 1/- per quarter higher.      The Argentine futures also finished about 9d. up.      It is reported that every effort is being made to scare Europe into buying by American speculators who are reducing the estimates of the exportable surplus from the new crop in the Argentine,      Canadians are still holding wheat at very high prices as compared with American and -Argentine.      It is stated that Australian exporters are satisfied with the price returned and consequently have not advanced with American and Canadian markets.Russians  are selling Barley to the Continent and It is stated they may have wheat to export later.
C confidential GENERAL TRADE,    (GONTD,)Op &quot;operative Trade * (G o nt d.)BACON ANDJHAMS, - At the close of the month the holiday feeTTng &quot;sfiTl dominated the position causing a weaker market tone for certain classes.     On the other hand North cf Ireland markets closed considerably stronger all quotations for roll bacon being considerably dearer.TEA. -     The past month has seen many fluctuations on the tea&quot; marketi it opened with rather slow and monotonous sales in low grade and medium qualix-ies which showed a dropping tendency at first, but towards the middle of the month medium grades became firm, and low and medium closed at the end of the month about id. per lb, dearer. Good quality descriptions met with strong demand at advancing rates during the whole month, and Ceylon1s closed at the end Id, to 1-gd. per lb. dearer.    Indian tea generally has not been of high quality and even though Ceylons have been better in this respect, the quality generally has not been up to standard,    Where quality has been maintained advancing prices have been realised.In view of heavy stocks of low grade tea this season consequent upon over production, the Indian and Ceylon Associations, as well as the Dutch growers, have decided to pluck finer tea next seaoon and so reduce the output, it is believed, by 10 per cent.   This should have the -effect of giving better quality tea of which there has been such a shortage this season and for which there is an ever increasing demand.COFFEE.-   The market was only sparingly supplied at the opening of the month and was consequently dull with irregular quotations, but with the arrival of new crop Costa Rica (from the Atlantic side) offerings were much better at about the middle of the month.   The Atlantic Costas, however, do not. interest the home trade much and the Pacific Oostas arrive much later.   Of this., new Coffee offerings displayed a rather irregular tones good qualities generally selling at steady to dearer rates, whilst ordinary qualities were at times rather difficult of sale.   The lower grades were very slow of request.For British East African Coffees the demand has been generally good for the best qualities *    Kenyas were particularly attractive and the finest qualities command extreme prices and even ordinary descriptions realised full and steady rates.   Tanganyika coffees offered were chiefly of poor qualij^r but in some cases some improvement in the size of the bean was shown.COCOA.-   During the past month there have been only a lImi%TecT*enquiry and a quiet demand on the Cocoa Market. Prices for West African have been varied only little, opening early in the month at 39/6d, then dropping at mid-month to 37/6d, and gradually rising again at the end of month to 39/6d, at which price they closed firm.
GOKPID.^NTI:\L. GENERAL TRADE.      (COKTD.)Go -^operative. prime ade (Gontd.)Trade on the West Coast has been very depressed and the low prices obtained for Cocoa has caused serious concern to the Farmers.     They are so dissatisfied with the prices that they are contemplating plucking only half their crops or storing a portion of the crop to force better prices.    The conflicting operations of the united Africa Co. and their competitors on the Coast do not tend to develop successful conditions of trade.CHOCOLATE. - Home trade has been, of course, very brisk&quot;indeed in view of Christmas.and all factories have been working at top pressure.   It is believed that business will at least equal last yearrs turnover, but probably not exceed it.......    iS-Latributiye Tvades.FROM SIR WOODMAN BURBIDQE.It may be desirable th.i3 month to review the conditions vrhich have prevailed in the distributive trades during 1929, and the information to hand on the trade experience during December,.confirms the impression that the tendencies which have made 1929 a difficult and disappointing year are still operating.The opening months of the year were, on the whole, fairly satisfactory, but as the year progressed a number of unfavourable factors had to be contended with, which made figures more and more difficult to maintain, until in the closing months of the year, they were in most cases definitely lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year.In comparing trade in 1929 with the experience of 1928, it has to be remembered that 1929 has been character-ised by falling prices, especially in the raw materials of the textile trades.   Cotton, wool, silk,, artificial silk and linen   are all lower, and in some cases substantially lower in price than they were at the beginning of the year, and this has naturally reflected in the prices of the merchandise distributed.The same tendenoy has been operating in nearly all commodities, /with the inevitable    result that while the same amount of merchandise may be sold, the cash turnover appears smaller.   On the other hand, the cost of selling the merchandise does not fall to a corresponding degree, and indeed the tendency for the costs of distribution to increase is causing some concern.In addition to this, however, there are definite signs that the purciiasing power of the public declined, especially in the second half of the year.   Reports to hand from all parts of the country indicate that the number of
GENERAL TRADE (CONTINUED).Distributive Trades  (Continued).transactions increased by,  in some cases, as much, as 50$ as compared with the previous year, but the value of the average sales check was much lower.Apart from the fall in prices, there was a perceptible falling off in the purchase of luxury articles, and the public has unquestionably been restricting its purchases to the barest minimum.     For example, while last year a cabinet gramophone might have been purchased, this year a portable has had to suffice, and,  in fact, there has been a great increase in the sale of portables to the prejudice of the more expensive Instruments.Whatever may be the true cause, or combination of causes, there is undoubtedly a general lack of confidence which is being reflected in restriction of buying;    and the extraordinarily unfavourable weather, especially in the closing months of the year, has done nothing to stimulate trade.So far as December itself is concerned, It has, unfortunately, proved little more favourable than Its Immediate predecessors.     In connection with the first half of the month, reference has again to be made to the disastrous effects of the very wild and stormy weather experienced.Finally, the Christmas trade, after being very late In starting,  proved in many oases, and especially in London, to be disappointing.      In a few cases in the Provinces, the week before Christmas proved sufficiently busy to bring up the figures for the month, but in the great majority of Stores, the general experience has been a large Increase in the number of transactions, but a serious falling off in the value of the individual purchase.With regard to the prospects for 1930, few Stores are prepared to make any prophecies, as it is difficult to see what is likely In the immediate future to modify the tendencies which have been operating during the last half year.     The basic textile Industries  in the North have had an extremely bad year, and, in South Wales, where the coal industry has shown signs of improvement during the Autumn, the population have been severely hit by the flooding.On the whole, it does not appear likely that confidence will be fully restored for some months yet and In particular until after the Budget proposals have been announced.

RAILWAY TRAFFIC  (CONTD.)FROM SIR CYRIL HURCQMB.During the four weeks ended 29th December, 1929, the railway traffic receipts of the four amalgamated companies shewed a decrease compared with the corresponding period of 1928 of  26,000.     This decrease is made up as under:-Passenger train traffic        Decrease  138,000Freight train traffic: Merchandise and Minerals      Increase 26,800Coal,  coke and patent fuel &quot; 85,200The latest traffic statistics available are those for the month of October, 1929.     Compared with the corresponding period in 1928 the number of passenger journeys taken on all standard gauge railways in Great Britain (excluding the London Tubes and Metropolitan District Railway) shewed an increase of nearly 2-g- millions or 3.2 per cent.     Consequent upon a reduction in traffic at all fares, however,  the receipts shewed a decrease of  55,000 or 1-3 per cent.Freight train traffic in October, 1929, shewed an increase of 2jg million tons compared with October, 1928, or 9.1 per cent.     Coal,  coke and patent fuel accounted for if millions of this increase.Substantial increases were also recorded in respect of the following commodities -Increase Per cent. &quot;Tons.Iron Ore....................    239,000 27.0Pig Iron....................     31,000 9.iron and Steel (includingscrap)...................      94,000 6.5Limestone (other than forroadmaking)..............      28,000 6.5Manure (packed).............      51,000 33.4Vegetables - potatoes...c.. 12,000 8.4 Vegetables - other thanpotatoes.................      92,000 55.3Roadmaking material.........      63, 000 9,2The carrying of commodities, where decreases were recorded, included the following:-Decrease.

PHILLIPS.As in previous years, the incidence of the Christmas holidays has caused fluctuations in the numbers unemployed on the Registers.    Usually, there is a pronounced drop In the figures during the three or four weeks before Christmas, followed by a sharp rise immediately afterwards-. -
GO NF IDE NT IAL.EMPLOYMSNT  (GONTINUSD).In 1927 the pre-Christmas fall amounted to about 49,000 and was followed by a rise of 236,000. In 1928 there was a pre-Christmas fall of 124,000 followed by a rise of 249,000.In December 1929, however, the figures continued to rise until the 16th of the month, when there was a drop of about 6,000 as compared with the previous week.It seems clear that the bad weather of the latter part of November and early December led to an Increase of unemployment In out-door occupations which tended to offset the improvement due to Christmas trade and traffic.      In addition there was some increase of unemployment In coal mining and in the cotton industry during December 1929, while In the previous year there was a very substantial improvement in coal mining and a slight improvement in cotton. (The coal mining figures were nevertheless much lower In December 1929 than In December 1928).     Furthermore, all the basic industries were improving at the end of 1928 whereas, with the two exceptions already mentioned, there was no important  change during December 1929,Between the 16th and 30th December 1929 (there was no return for 23rd December), the numbers on the Register increased by 206,674 giving a total at 30th December of 1,510,231.     Every Division shared in the Increase which was relatively heaviest, however,&apos; in the Midlands, North Eastern and North Western Divisions.     As In previous years, this increase is due to the discharge of workers engaged for temporary Christmas work, to the extension of holida3rs, and to the addition to the register of children who left school at the end of the Christmas term, and had not obtained employment.The average Live Register for the first three Mondays of December was 1,305,330.      If the figures for 30th December are included the average becomes 1,356,555.Between 25th November and 16th December, there was a slight increase of unemployment in coal mining.     The numbers wholly unemployed fell by about 1,600 but the temporary stoppages increased by 5,200.     There was practically no change in Iron and steel, general engineering, the motor vehicle industry, shipbuilding;    or the woollen textile industry.      In cotton, however, there was an increase In the numbers unemployed.     As might be expected there was also an Increase In the building trade and in public works contracting.The total number of insured persons in employment at 16th December was about 13,800 less than at 25th November but was 100,300 greater than at 17th December, 1928.

The export of palm kernels in 1928 amounted to 67,105 tons  (valued at  1,150,649).   This was the largest quantity shipped from Sierra Leone in any year, and exceeded the quantity exported in 1927 (itself a record) by 1,669 tons.For the first 9 months of 1929 the export of palm kernels amounted to 47,097 tons  (valued at  693,312) as compared with 55,645 tons  (valued at  953,912) during the corresponding period of 1928.
COLONIAL TRADE (contd..) .The value of the total commercial exports from Sierra Leone for the first 9 months of 1929 amounted to  1,220,626 as compared with  1,4:42,991 during the corresponding period in 1928.British Malaya.    The amount of rubber exported from British Malaya in November 1929 totalled 46,279 tons;  as compared with 47,937 tons in October and 68,072 tons in November 1928.    &quot;or the first eleven months of 1929 the gross exports were 528,689 tons; as compared with 341,930 tons for the corresponding period in 1928.The output of tin and tin in ore from the Federated Malay States for the first eleven months of 1929 amounted to 61,194 tons.    This compares with 56,649 tons in the corresponding period of 1928.SOUTH AMLitTCAN TRADE.FROM MR. HOSE.Since my last Report to the Council a month ago, a development of some importance has taken place in Argentine conditions, which, I regret to say, must be regarded as being of a retrograde character,    I refer to the Government Decree which was issued in Argentina on 17th December last, suspending the obligation of the Conversion Office to deliver gold in exchange for paper pesos.    In this connection, under the Conversion Law of 4th November, 1899, the Argentine Conversion Office was authorised to issue and deliver on demand paper pesos for gold coin in the proportion of one paper peso for 44 gold cents and vice versa.    The effect of the heavy withdrawals of gold for export under these provisions during the past few months was sufficient to occasion a somewhat severe degree of stringency in the money market, and the Government doubtless feared that if the efflux of the metal were permitted to continue, there might be a shortage of funds during the busier   months of the cereal export season.    The immediate effect of the closing of the Conversion Office was naturally to depress the exchange and the value of the Argentine peso fell at one time to below 45d.    It has sinoe been announced, however, that the Argentine Government has been successful in placing in London a line of one-year Bills for a total amount of  5,000,000, and an appreciable recovery in the exchange quotation has occurred.    Actually, the gold reserve to the note circulation is as much as SO per cent., so that the whole situation reflects the archaic monetary system of Argentina,  the reform of which is long overdue.In regard to the Argentine crop situation,  r.he cutting and threshing of wheat are proceeding actively, and it is estimated that the total exports of the grain this season will be between 2^- and 3 million tons - about half of last year&apos;s total.    Linseed results are stated to be poor, with
OOHFIDEHTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (contd..).exports well under normal.Trade conditions in Chile have recently undergone little change, the general situation being favourable.    In the nitrate of soda industry, there has been a tendency for some time past for production to increase relatively to consumption, and the Government is reported to have under consideration a scheme whereby the more expensively-producing oficinas would close, so that the output might be to some extent restricted to the works operating on the lower basis of costs.The credit and commercial situation in Brazil remains extremely difficult;    the textile industry in Sao Paulo is very depressed, and importers generally are averse to placing fresh orders for imported goods.    A feature of recent Brazilian conditions has been the inauguration of the oampaign for the Presidential Election.    In the mean-time, coffee prices remain I0-7, and the problem of dealing with the heavy stocks of the commodity in the Interior still awaits solution.More active conditions have recently been in evidence in the Peruvian markets for sugar and cotton, but the general commercial situation in Peru is affected by stringent financial conditions, which, during the last weeks of 19&apos;^9, adversely affected exchange conditions. Dealings in Peruvian currency became a matter of difficulty, and quotations are quite nominal.    In order to relieve the situation, it is reported that the Government proposes to seek a foreign loan and also to export the currency reserve held in gold, so that interest may be allowed to accrue thereon.    In any case, the exchange outlook is very obscure and the whole economic situation unsatisfactory.The Central American countries and also Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela are also affected by the world coffee situation and the Brazilian impasse.    Mail advioes from the last-mentioned Republic state that the coffee crop is superior in quality to that of last year, but that Europe and the United States display little interest in purchasing.    Trade generally in Venezuela, however, is considered   satisfactory.    In Ecuador, exports of coffee have been fairly satisfactory, while the cocoa market has been active, and reports regarding the Christmas cocoa crop have been favourable; the commercial situation generally, however, is dull.    Colombia is affected not only by coffee conditions, but also by the delay of Congress in passing the Budget and other essential legislation.    Imports into the Republic tend to be still more restricted, and the re-discount rate of the Central Bank has been raised to 9 per cent.    Salvador iB especially dependent upon coffee, and economic conditions in the country generally are unfavourable.The depressed state of the coffee market and the difficulty of making sales of any considerable quantities is having a depressing effect upon business generally in Guatemala, and the coffee planters are making every endeavour to minimise their expenses.    It is of special interest to note that the new line of the International Railways of Central America has been opened to traffic, thus establishing through communication between Guatemala and Salvador.
