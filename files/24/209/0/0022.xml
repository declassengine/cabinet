THIS document IS the property of HIS britannic majesty&apos;s government.Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1930. SECRET. Copy No.   &apos; &apos;CP. 23 (30).CABINET.NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE CONCLUSION OF A TREATY with egypt.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a copy of a telegram from Sir Percy Loraine, our High Commissioner in Cairo, reporting a conversation with Nahas Pasha in regard to the proposals of the latter for the conduct of negotiations with His Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to the conclusion of a treaty, together with the draft of a reply which I propose, subject to the approval of my colleagues, to return to Sir P. Loraine.I am in favour of informing Nahas Pasha that I shall be willing to receive an Egyptian deputation as soon as the Naval Conference has concluded its labours, as I consider that this procedure is probably essential for Nahas Pasha if he is to carry his people with him.I see no reason to quarrel with the immediate action Nahas Pasha proposes to take in the Egyptian Parliament, as it is his responsibility to deal with that body;, at the same time, in informing Sir Percy Loraine of our acquiescence in the step Nahas Pasha proposes to take in the Egyptian Parliament, I think we should instruct him to tell Nahas Pasha that we must request from him some indication of the points which the delegation will desire to discuss in London; and the modifica-tions of our proposals which the Wafd Government desire to achieve.Nahas Pasha can quite well furnish these indications to our High Commissioner without any question arising as regards negotiations in Cairo, which Nahas Pasha for his own reasons seems so anxious to avoid.A. H.Foreign Office, January 24, 1930.Sir P. Loraine to Mr. A. Henderson. (Received January 22, 9 a.m.)Cairo, January 21, 1930.(No. 39.   Strictly Confidential.   Important.) (January 21, 11 -15 p.m.)PRIME Minister, when he dined with me last night to meet Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, asked to see me to discuss procedure as regards treaty.He did so this morning in two aspects (1.) Vis-a-vis Egyptian Parliament.(2.) Vis-a-vis His Majesty&apos;s Government in United Kingdom.As regards (1), he proposes in the next few days to seek a mandate from Parliament &quot; to negotiate with British Government Mr. Henderson&apos;s treaty proposals,&quot; and to do so with the same spirit of friendliness and conciliation as that which inspired the proposals and animate British and Egyptian Governments alike with a view to reaching a complete settlement. He would give the House a few days fo reflect on this, and would hope to get mandate by an unqualified vote of confidence in his Government next week. 5219   [20488]
this reasons for inclining towards this procedure are that it will stop all discussion on points of detail and leave the Government a free hand to negotiate. Once he has got his mandate he will refuse all discussion of particular points in Parliament, and hopes you will be able to do likewise, on the ground that matter has been removed for the time being from [ ? group omitted] of public discussion and reserved for intimate treatment between the two Governments.As regards (2), he wishes to know whether you share his desire to proceed as rapidly as possible, and considers an Egyptian delegation headed by himself should proceed to London as early as possible.I said I felt sure that you were anxious to proceed with all speed, but I thought it preferable to clear as much of the ground [ &apos;i omitted : as possible] in Cairo and define what remained to settle in London before an Egyptian delegation went there.Nahas said he well appreciated the force of latter observation, and it would be infinitely easier for him to negotiate in Cairo, where he had all his technical experts, his party and public opinion at his back. If he meant to have a hard negotiation and to stand out for what Egypt conceived to be her full rights he would negotiate here. But that was not the case. He firmly intended to have an agreement and to have it rapidly; he wanted frank conciliatory discussion; he knew concessions were needed to reach agreement and hoped that each party might in this spirit help towards meeting the other&apos;s point of view; he sincerely believed that a formula could be found which would cover and reconcile respective desiderata. He also believed that my presence at discussions in London would be most helpful, and he said that he and his colleagues would be much gratified if I could go there simultaneously with them.Only in London could negotiations be conducted discreetly, swiftly and con-fidentially. In Cairo it was impossible to treat things secretly. Firstly, there were always leakages; secondly, press was agog for news, and ill-natured persons fabricated it for their own purposes if nothing authentic were forthcoming. In either case there would be public discussion in Egypt of points at issue, which might and most probably would wreck the discussions. He therefore wanted to get his mandate, say nothing more about the treaty until it suited His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to receive him and his colleagues in London, negotiate there and bring back a treaty to Cairo which would at once be submitted to Parliament in accordance with his promise.I recognised that his argument had considerable force; I pointed out, however, when he suggested possibility of going to London in February that it would almost certainly be impossible for you to tackle Egyptian question until Naval Conference had ended, and that conference might well last six weeks. He said this was perfectly reasonable, and he would, if you agreed, receive a delegation, prepare to start at the beginning of March and postpone departure till later should Naval Conference be protracted.He laid greatest emphasis on highly confidential character of our conversation and of his projects as here recorded, saying that if he were suspected of collusion with me about the method of procedure he would be in a position of very serious difficulty. His approach to Parliament must be entirely off his own bat, and any suggestion that he had been frightened by me would be calamitous.I said I would take every possible precaution on my side and that you would act similarly.  I would submit what he said and await your reply.On the whole, I see no reason for rejecting Nahas&apos;s plan. I am certain that proposed procedure as regards Egyptian Parliament is the wisest, and in view of his other arguments and his spontaneous request that I also should go to London I am willing to waive any previous insistence on preliminary discussion in Cairo.Draft Reply to Sir P. Loraine. YOUR telegram No. 39 of the 21st January.i am prepared to trust to the discretion of Nahas Pasha as to the manner in which he may think best to handle his own Parliament as regards the conduct ot negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government.I would also agree to receive an Egyptian deputation in London^as he proposes, as soon as the Naval Conference has been concluded, probably in March or April. Before, however, the delegation arrives, it is essential that Nahas Pasha should furnish to you full indications of the direction in which his Government desire to
secure modification of the proposals which I have submitted, since while i am anxious to facilitate his task in every way possible, I must once again make it clear to him that, generally speaking, the proposals I have made represent the extreme limit of concession which His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to make in existing circumstances. We must be assured beforehand that in using the words &quot; no hard negotiation &quot; he intends only modifications of form and detail.Nahas Pasha can quite well furnish you with the indications I propose without any question arising of negotiations between you and him in Cairo, which he seems so anxious to avoid.You should press him very urgently on this point, as His Majesty&apos;s Government must know exactly how they stand as regards the intentions of the Egyptian Govern-ment before the arrival of the delegation.I appreciate his difficulties, and during the past months have done everything possible to meet them, but he must realise that I have difficulties on my side. A wide and influential section of public opinion here is opposed to concession already indicated, which it regards as excessive. I must take serious account of this opinion and know with some degree of certainty intentions of the Egyptian Government as regards our treaty offer before arrival of Egyptian delegation in this country.I agree that, if and when delegation comes to London for purpose of negotiating, it would be desirable for you to be in London.
