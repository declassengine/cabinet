his document is the. property of Hie Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).E 0 RE. T. ,&quot;-&quot; CABINET..P. 41  (30)THE AMERICAN VISA.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I understand that the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have been discussing the question of abolishing or reducing the fee of 10 dollars now charged to Americans for a visa to visit this country but have failed to reach any agreement.Assuming a visa to be necessary,  I recognise that the question of the fee to be charged for the services rendered in that connection is primarily a matter for my colleagues above mentioned.    On this point, I, as Home Secretary, am only concerned in respect of certain reactions which insistence upon a fee widely regarded as excessive may produce.    What however does more closely concern me,  is the prior question whether a visa is necessary at all in the case of Americans visiting this country.The need for a visa does not arise from any statutory        ^ requirement.    It results entirely from administrative directions given by me under the Aliens Order.    When conditions were less settled in the years immediately following the war the visa served a very useful purpose.    Quite frankly, it has now,  so far as Americans are concerned, completely outlived its usefulness; and I could dispense with it to-morrow without any inconvenience. I have not hitherto taken any definite step in that direction because I did not wish,  if I could help it, to be the means of cutting off a useful source of public revenue, the receipts from the fee at its present rate bringing in I understand no less than  175,000 a year.But the visa system cannot be justified publicly on financial grounds.    Parliament has given us no right to levy a
- 2 -tax on aliens desiring to enter the country and British representatives at International Conferences called to discuss the reciprocal abolition of visas have declared more than once with full authority that the visa is not regarded by this country as a fiscal instrument.There has been, as my colleagues are no doubt aware,  a growing agitation against the present high charge of 10 dollars. The cry has been taken up vigorously by the Travel Association and others interested in fostering the American tourist traffic. I believe the Foreign Secretary considers that the time has come when the fee must be abolished or at any rate reduced to a very modest figure.    That is entirely my own view,    I do not wish to embarrass the Chancellor of the Exchequer but it is my duty to point out that the demand for the abolition or reduction of the visa fee may at any time be transformed into a demand for the abolition of the visa0    What i should myself prefer is that the visa should go, for as I have said the case for maintaining it, so far as the direct interests of this country are concerned, has really disappeared.    But if the Foreign Secretary thinks that a valid ground for maintaining the visa can be found in the fact that the United States - where there are both legal and practical difficulties that do not exist here - have not so far agreed to reciprocal action and that a reduction of the fee,  to say, 2 dollars, which is the approximate amount of the standard fee charged in continental countries in the few instances in which a visa is still required, will placate the present agitation and if the Chancellor of the Exchequer is willing to agree to  such a reduction I shall be prepared to acquiesce, reserving of course . the right to reopen, the question if the agitation should be renewed.J a R q C .HOME OFFICE, WHITEHALL..8th February,  1930.
