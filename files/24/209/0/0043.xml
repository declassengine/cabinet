THIS document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;8 government.Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1930. SECRET. Copy No.        3CP 44 (30).CABINET.WIRELESS TELEPHONY COMMITTEE.Covering Letter by the Chairman.Air Ministry, Gwydyr House,Whitehall, S. W. 1, February 10, 1930. 1.   AS Chairman of the Wireless Telephony Committee appointed under Conclusion 7 of Cabinet 48 (29), I submit herewith the covering memorandum, conclusions, and recommendations of that Committee.   The detailed report will be issued in due course.2. In view of the complexity of the subject and the thorough investigation called for by the terms of reference, a full and detailed report has been desirable, and, indeed, inevitable, not only for purposes of record, but also to justify the conclusions reached and the unanimous recommendations of the Members of the Committee. The attached covering memorandum, which summarises the chief points at issue, will, it is hoped, assist the Cabinet in deciding on the policy to be pursued.3. Since the drafting of the Report a letter has been received from the Chairman of Imperial and International Communications, Limited, proposing that a trial should be carried out by the Company and the Post Office, to South Africa, with both systems, in order to provide a practical test of their relative efficiency.The Members of the&apos; Committee are of the opinion, however, that the results of such a test would not add anything to the verv exhaustive evidence which has already been presented to them. They are informed, further, that the Post Office are not, at present, in a position to carry out a test to South Africa, owing to lack of the necessary apparatus. Any test, if authorised, would have to be made either with Canada or Australia. Such a procedure would, almost certainly, involve further difficulties with the Company, the creation of which is highly undesirable. More-over, the acceptance of this proposal would inevitably cause considerable delay in the submission of our report, and the circumstances are such that we do not consider this delay either desirable or necessary. The Committee, therefore, recommends that no comparative test be carried out.4. Finally, I desire to bring to your notice a lengthy article which was printed in the &quot; Times &quot; of the 30th January; this was followed next day by a report of a personal interview given by Sir Basil Blackett, Chairman of the Communications Company, to a representative of the &quot;Daily Mail.&quot; These publications, besides disclosing, most improperly, that the question of policy had been referred to a Cabinet Committee, contain a highly coloured partisan statement of the Company&apos;s case and an account of the proposals which they laid before the Committee.THOMSON.[20543]
COVERING MEMORANDUM.Conclusions.&apos; - 1. The first point to which our attention was directed was the claim of Imperial and International Communications, Limited (referred to in subsequent paragraphs as the I. &amp; I.C.) that they have some moral right to operate the Wireless Telephony Services emanating from Great Britain. While recognising that this claim was put forward in good faith, the Committee are of opinion that it is based on a misapprehension and can in no way be substantiated.2. Our next step was to compare the systems for operating Wireless Telephony services advocated by the Post Office and I. &amp; I.C. respectively. The chief bases of comparison were : (a.) Their technical merits.(b.) Their financial implications.In regard to (a), after hearing the expert advisers of the Post Office and the representatives of the I. &amp; I.C. (including the Marchese Marconi himself, who submitted several written statements), we realised that we were not competent, without further advice, to express an opinion on the technical points involved. We therefore consulted two independent experts, Dr. F. E. Smith and Professor Howe, whose joint report is given in Appendix F of the full report. From this report we reached the conclusion that the Post Office system is at least as efficient, for present purposes, as that employed by the I. &amp; I.C.; that it has the further distinct advantage of providing greater flexibility through its equipment, and that it can be more readily adapted to new developments and inventions. In this latter connection, the Committee feel that it is only fair to the I. &amp; I.C. to recognise the value of the research work it has carried out, more especially that of Marchese Marconi. For this reason the Committee feel that any possible co-operation between the Research Department of the Post Office and the L &amp; I.C. would be in the public interest.As regards (b), we find that for the purpose of working four Dominion services under the proposals of the Post Office the annual charges are estimated to amount to  39,000, exclusive of costs common to both systems. These charges include depre-ciation, costs of maintenance, land lines, and interest on the capital outlay involved, estimated to amount to some  119,000, which would be provided out of loans authorised by the Post Office money acts.Proposal 2 of the Imperial and International Communications Company as set out in Appendix B would cost the State  61,000 per annum. This sum is reached by adding to the Company &apos;s figure the annual cost of land lines charged on the standard Post Office basis. It will be seen that the difference in favour of the Post Office proposal amounts to  22,000 per annum. This difference will be increased in the event of the revenue rising to a point which would entitle the Company to remuneration above the minimum figure.We took note of the capital sums already expended on the Rugby station, and the fact that the returns on these are at present negligible. We were also influenced by the further consideration that, if the Wireless Telephony services should be operated from the I. &amp; PC. Beam Stations, the situation at Rugby could not greatly be improved and might even deteriorate.&quot;We are satisfied, moreover, that, when the Wireless Telephony services come to be extended as undoubtedly they will be with new inventions the gain to the public Exchequer will be increased by adopting the Post Office system.3. At our request, Lord Passfield, the Chairman of the Imperial Communica-tions Pommittee, submitted a memorandum on the strategical aspects of this question. The chief point affecting; our decision was the question of vulnerability to air attack. Lord Passfield&apos;s Committee stated that it was preferable either to locate the centre, if concentrated, in such a position as will lie outside the probable radius of enemy aircraft or bombardment by enemy war vessels from the sea; or else to disperse the stations; thereby decreasing greatly the risk of total disablement.We consider that the location of the Post Office station at Rugby more nearly fulfils these conditions than do certain of the Company&apos;s Beam stations situated on the coast.
4. Lord Passfield also kindly furnished us with a memorandum showing the position in the different Dominions of Wireless Telephony communications. From this memorandum it is apparent that the Dominion Governments are still undecided as to their future policy. A Wireless Telephony service is already in operation with Canada from Rugby, but through a station in the U.S.A., and we have noted the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada for a direct service with the Mother country. On the general question we are of the opinion, however, that the Dominions will have no ground for comment or complaint in regard to the control of Wireless Telephony services operated from this country, provided that transmission and reception are efficient.5. Our attention was drawn to foreign competition, principally American, with British efforts in the field of wireless communications generally (telegraphic, as well as telephonic). The report of the Imperial Communications Committee states that the only British commercial company capable of meeting such competition is the I. &amp; I.C., and we feel, therefore, that every assistance should be o-iven to this company, by diplomatic and other means, to obtain concessions in Foreign countries and throughout the Empire.Complaint has been made that the Post Office purchases the bulk of its require-ments of wireless material from a firm with works in London, but financed by American capital, in preference to purchasing from Cables and Wireless, Ltd., the parent company of the I. &amp; I.C. The Post Office state that tenders are invited from both companies, but that those of the former have usually been successful because they are not only slightly cheaper, but are, from a technical point of view, superior, and that it would not be in accordance with the usual practice of Government Departments to discriminate between two firms, both employing British labour, by reason of the existence of foreign capital. Any such discrimination would open large and debatable questions of policy. We are informed by the Post Office that they have offered to Cables and Wireless, Limited, the opportunity of technical discussions on the specifications prepared by the Post Office before issue. It is hoped that if the Company avail themselves of this offer there can be no scope for misapprehension as to the Departments requirements.After carefully weighing the conclusions set out above, we make the following recommendations : (1.) That the long-distance Wireless Telephony services in the United Kingdom should be retained under Government Control and operated by the Post Office through the Rugby station for transmission, and through that at Baldock or elsewhere for reception.(2.) That the Post Office should open up new services with the Dominions, Colonies and foreign countries whenever economically justified.(3.) That Imperial and International Communications, Limited, should be helped by diplomatic and other means in their endeavours to obtain concessions in the Dominions, Colonies and foreign countries.Recommendations.(Signed)THOMSON (Chairman).H.
