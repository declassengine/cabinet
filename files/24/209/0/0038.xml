288(THIS DOCIMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BPJLTMIfl C MAJESTY&apos;B CAB I If E T.COPY NO-The Indian Ev.-d et 1930-31. Proposed Taxation of Cotton Imports.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.The Budget of the Government of India for 1930-31 includes the following taxation proposals:-(l)    to raise the import duty on cotton piecegoods from 11% to 15% ad valorem:(2)    tp impose a minimum specific duty of 3-g- annas per pound on plain grey cotton goods - that is, to levy on such goods either 15% ad valorem or 3-g- annas per pound, whichever is greater.- The object of these proposals is twofold - first to raise additional revenue, and secondly, to protect the Indian cotton industry.       Both proposals serve the latter purpose, &quot;but it is anticipated that the specific duty of 3-g- annas, if effective will involve some loss of revenue.2. As a revenue proposal, the&quot; ,-ease for the 15% duty isvery strong.        In preparing next year&apos;s Budget, the Government of India are faced with a large deficit on the basis of existing taxation.        It is difficult in India to find new sources of revenue, and the increase of the cotton duty is one obvious method cf meeting the situation.      This, however, by itself will not serve to bridge the gap, and it will probably be found necessary to impose also an import duty on silver and to increase the import duties on kerosene and sugar.        Goods imported into India in general pay 15^ ad valorem, the principal exceptions being luxury goods and goods falling within the scope of the protective    jCPET . P.39(30) .
&quot;    289policy of the Government of India,both of which classes pay more than the general rate. There is an influential body ofopinion in India which regards it as unreasonable that cotton goods should pay less than the normal 15$ and now that addi-tional taxation is to be imposed, the Government of India find it impossible to avoid proposing this increase.3. The question of protecting the Indian industry standson a different footing.      In 1927 the Indian Tariff Boardrecommended that the duty on pieeegoods should be raised from11$ to 15$.       The Government of India did not accept thisrecommendation, but preferred to protect the yarn industry-aless important measure - and to stimulate the Bombay millownersto attempt to restore prosperity to the industry by increasingthe efficiency of labour and by other measures of internalorganisation.       The attempt, however, to introduce efficiencymethods led to serious strikes, which left the industry weakerthan before.4. Last year Mr.Hardy was placed on -special duty to reportamong other things, on the extent and severity of external competition with the products of the Indian mills.    His report shows that in certain directions competition has become more severe than ever, and especially in plain grey goods.       The present proposals of the Government of India follow naturally on this finding.5. It is perhaps unnecessary for me to examine the merits of the increase of the general rate to 15$ as a protective measure, as this increase is necessary for revenue purposes, and can be fully justified from that point of view.      It may suffice to say that, as the increase was recommended by the Tariff&quot; Board in 1927, and as the position has since deterior-ated,  it has been accepted by the Government cf India,  and will no doubt be accepted by Indian opinion, as necessary as a protective measure.       The case for the specific duty of 3^ annas on plain grey goods will probably be regarded in india as
as even stronger, especially in view of Sir. Hardy&apos;s report; but the proposal seems to me open to criticism.      Except in the Bombay city, the industry admittedly does not require more protection than will be given by the 15% duty, and the effect therefore would be to render assistance to a number of Indian mills whioh do not require    it at the expense of the consumer. The expectation of the Government of India no doubt is that the imposition of this special duty would give a &quot;breathing time to the mills in the Bombay city to bring themselves up to the level of other Indian mills, but there is no positive assurance that this will be done.        In so  far as the introduction of efficiency methods is concerned, the    efforts of the millowners to introduce these have caused difficulties with labour, and as, in BomToay, important Unions are in the hands of communists there will no doubt be difficulty in securing the co-operation of labour;    while in regard to other measures of internal organisation, there is no evidence that the Bombay millowners have made any serious attempt to put their house in order. The Government of India, however, have impressed on the mill-owners that a drastic reorganisation is necessary,    and although they have recognised the efforts that have already been made and the difficulty created by labour troubles, they do not  consider that progress has been sufficiently rapid.       They have suggested a number of points for examina-tion, and have left the responsibility for action with the millowners, who are now required to investigate the matterand start concerting plans of action.from6. I do not conceal/myself the fact that these newtaxes,  if imposed, will inflict substantial damage on British trade, and this I deplore.        Although the Lancaa-shire trade is mainly in finer qualities, I imagine thatthe
231the speeifis duty on plain grey goods,  coupled with an increase in the general ad valorem rate, will hit Lancashire in three rSays. First, the increase in the ad valorem ratewill affect its general trade;  secondly,  its trade in plain grey goods is &quot;bound to suffer seriously; and thirdly, as the trade of Japan in plain grey goods will also suffer,  Japan may be forced by the new duties to turn to higher cgunts, with the result that Lancashire will be faced with increased compe-tition from that quarter in the finer goods.7.        I turn n^w to the position of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand of the Secretary of State for India in a matter of thiskind.       It will be remembered that the Joint Select Committeeon the Government of India Bill, 1919, recommenced the recognition of a constitutional Convention that, when the Governmentof India and their Legislature were in agreement on a tariffmeasure, the Secretary of State should not intervene.    Mr.-Montagu and all succeeding Secretaries of State have,  eitherdireotly or tacitly, recognised this convention, and none ofthem has taken any action inconsistent with it.        In the work India are required to consult the Secretary of ing of the convention the Government of /State before placingproposals before the Legislature, but on these proposals theSecretary of State has not issued instructions - he has merelyoffered observations.    If, after oonsidering his observations,the Government of India still desired to place their proposals before the Legislature, they have been left free to do so.If,  in such circumstances,  the proposals are accepted by theLegislature, the Convention comes into operation and theSecretary of State does not intervene.8.       &apos; As regards the increase in tho general duty from 11% to 15%,  I tfo not see any ground on which I can ask theGovernment
Government of India to reconsider their proposal. Additional revenue is needed.,  and I cannot suggest any alter-native.    Moreover,  I have already informed the Viceroy privately that,  in so far as the 15$ duty is concerned,  I will observe tho convention; hut I have impressed upon him that if the Indian industry is to enjoy this measure of pro-tection, the millowners should share the resulting benefits with the workers..9. As regards the proposed specific duty of 3-g- annas, Ipropose to criticise this on the lines indicated above, and to-morrow a Committee of my Council will consider a draft telegram for this purpose.      I am bound, however, to say that I consider it unlikely that these criticisms will have any effect.10.        I trust that I shall have the concurrence of my colleagues&apos; in acting as I propose.     Whatever may be the merits of the Fiscal Autonomy Convention as an abstract constitutional doctrine,  it is clearly out of the question fo me,  especially in view of the present political situation in India, to attempt to  control the Government of India and their Legislature in a field of policy in which my pre-predecessors have deliberately and avowedly refrained from exercising control.w.b.6th February 1930.
