2n r*ns DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CHET Copy No.p., 34.(30&apos;) CABINS TPOOR   LA.1    ORDERS. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER 0? HEALTH.On April 1st,  1930, Part 1 of the Local Government Act, 1929,  comes into operation.      Boards of Guardians disappear and their functions are taken over by the County and County Borough Councils.The responsibility for.poor law administration is vested in the Minister of Health and is not as in the oase of other social services entrusted to the Local Authorities.       For the discharge of this responsibility the Minister is empowered to issue orders which hare the force of law and in particular is empowered to make regulations governing the administration of relief to the able-bodied poor (Poor Law Act,  1927, Section 7&quot;).To facilitate the task of the new poor law authoriiies (whose establishment in this capacity was then regarded as imminent) the poor law statutes ranging over more than 300 years are consolidated by the Poor Law Act 1927,  and a Bill for the re-enactment of that Act, with the amendments made by the Act of 1929 is now before Parliament and will it is hoped become law before the 1st April,  1C30.Similar considerations apply to the Poor Law Orders, which have been issued at varying dates during the past century,. These Orders were first consolidated in a General Order of 1847, but have since been extensively amended and extended.      Proposals for a reoonsolidation have frequently been mooted,  but have not hitherto been carried through,  only sectional consolidation (including the consolidation in 1911 of the Orders relating to the administration of relief to the able-bodied) having been found practicable.
n n nIn accordance with an undertaking given by my predecessor I have prepared a new and complete consolidation of the Orders on the footing stipulated in that undertaking that the consolidation shall involve only such amendments, or rather adaptations, as the changes made by the Act of 1929 necessitate, and that the fuller revision of the Orders ghall await suggestions to be made in the course of the next two or three years by the new authorities in the light of their experience of their new duties.I am however faced by a difficulty in regard to the section of the regulations which has already been mentioned and deals with the administration of relief to able-bodied persons.On the one hand I feel that I ought not without the express concurrence of my colleagues either to include the belief Regulation Order, 1911 as it stands in the draft consolidated Order or, especially when regard is had to the general lines of the consolidation which has been undertaken,  to make in that Order . the amendments which I myself am disposed to consider advisable.On the other hand it is of the first Importance that the new Order (which has to be available in draft form for forty days before its actual issue) shall be In the hands of the local authorities in its final form well before April 1st and that its probable content shall be within their knowledge without further delay. The terms of the Order must affect details and often main issues of the organisation which the new authorities are preparingIn these circumstances I have decided for the present at any rate to prooeed at once with the great bulk of the draft order which has been prepared, but to reserve for the considerationof my colleagues the section dealing with the regulation of relief.If no further action should be taken the Relief Regulation Order, 1911 with all its defects will continue to apply to the
administration of the new authorities.I attach copies of the Order of 1911 and of the draft Order which I should propose to issue in its place. It will be seen that the Articles in which substantialalterations are contemplated aro Articles II and IX to XI of the Order of 1911 which I would replace by Articles 5 and 7 to 10 o-p the draft Order.The Ordor of 1911 opens (Article II) with a prohibition of any outdoor relief.      The effect of this is that where an able-bodied man applies for relief he should normally b9 given an Order for the workhouse.      There is (Article Il(2)) a general exemption in favour of oertain disabilities - e.g. sickness, age and widowhood,  and provision Is made (Articles IX to XI) under whidh outdoor relief can be given conditionally to the able-bodied during periods of exceptional distressi There is finally a general Article allowing the Guardians to depart from the Order (i.b.  to allow unconditional outdoor relief) practically wherevor they choose to do so;    the Minister however retains generally a power to disapprove the departure made and,  if he exercises&apos; this power, relief.-  is continued only at the risk of surcharge.In fact an order for the workhouse would not be regarded as being the natural or appropriate form of relief for an able-bodied man in any large industrial Union whore there is heavy unemployment. On the other hand there are very few such Unions in which it is found practicable to apply the conditions in the Relief Regulation Order generally.      The effect
oi the Order ia the present circumstances is that I have to give at least a tacit consent in every case in v/hich unconditional outdoor relief is given, though I cannot in the nature of things have the information which would justify me in regarding- the individual case, as the Regulations require, as a particular instance of emergency. I object to the existing Order(1) Because I do not believe that a workhouse order ought to be offered (except in special circumstances) to a person applying for relief, particularly if xelief is needed on the ground of unemployment,(2) Because in the Unions to which I have referred the picture drawn by the regulations is totally at variance with the facts of administration.The alteration which I suggest, it will be seen from the draft appended, is(1) entirely tooaait the requirement of institutional (or workhouse) relief which inspires the administration in many places and deters many who ought to have relief from iasking application for it.(2) to require every local authority to prepare arrangements for conditional outdoor relief.(2) to expand (on lines already practised at such Unionsas Sal-ford and poplar) the existing condition of a task of work so as to encourage the replacement of useless, deterrent tasks by instructional classes (including classes for physical training).(4.) to require that so far as the arrangements permit they shall be applied in all cases of outdoor.relief to able-bodied men and(5) to recognise the limits of practicability and leave to the Councils the responsibility of deciding how they will- A -
%do their work of relieving destitution where they cannot make arrangements adequate to cover the whole of the abla-bodied men relieved.The powers of control which I propose to reserve to the Minister (apart jf course from his power to issue a speoial Order in any area for which he may think it desirable to do so) are(1) the power to require a local authority to discontinue or amend its arrangements for work or training and(2) the power to disapprove (so invoking a liability tosurcharge) relief granted in a case in which the arrangements permit of work or training, but neither is in fact required of the applicant.I need not say that I propose io preserve the existingdiscretion to afford unconditional relief in cases cf sickness.(Intd.)
