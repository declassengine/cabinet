7/   dNote by thb Chancellor of the Exchequer.I CIRCULATE herewith a Memorandum by the Treasury on the Financial Aspects of the Naval Conference.The object of the Conference being to obtain adequate security at sea at the lowest possible cost, the interest of the Treasury therein is not greatly less than that of the Foreign Office and the Admiralty. Before deciding on the policy to be adopted by the British representatives it is therefore desirable that the Cabinet should have before them the views of the Treasury, as their financial advisers, as well as the views of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office.Foreign Offices want agreement; Navy Boards want limitation; only Treasuries want reduction, and they are given little chance to be heard.This memorandum is not, however, put forward on any academic view of the functions of various Departments, but because of the very real danger that if the parity agreement is interpreted as the Admiralty seems to be interpreting it, and if other Governments follow suit, there is no hope that limitation will lead to reduction.The public confidently expect that the policy of disarmament will lead to substantial reductions in the present rate of expenditure; and a confession of complete failure, in this respect, after the promises held out by Government, and the enthusiastic support with which the Government&apos;s policy has been received, will bo severely criticized, and impossible to defend.P. s.December 16, 1929............... .....        .    .        ........... ...........     .............[20272&quot;   &apos;:.   .

IN his Memorandum (F.S. (29) 14) of the 18th October, 1929, to the Fighting Services Committee, the First Lord of the Admiralty has stated what, in the view of the Board of Admiralty, must be the future size of the Fleet, and the new construction requirements, if the conclusions of the Conference accord with his interpretation of the Parity Agreement. His proposals involve a building programme over the next five years estimated to cost  56,000,000, and therefore actually larger and more expensive than that carried out by the Conservative Government, and including 14 large 6-inch cruisers (of apparently 6,500 tons) at a cost of  22,000,000. The Admiralty estimate that this policy involves the &quot;stabilisation&quot; of Navy Estimates (after a slight fall in 1930 and 1931) at  57 / 58 millions, or say  2 millions above their present figure of  56 millions, which is itself  2 millions more than was spent in 1923.Table of Navy Estimates.

Moreover, these figures allow nothing for possible capital ship replacement, which, if capital ships are not abolished, must inevitably involve immensely heavy additional expenditure, probably much more than  50 millions, in the decade follow-ing 1936, even if the life of present ships is extended by another 5 years. Nor is any allowance made for aircraft carriers.Urgent Need for Reduction of Defence Estimates.3. If this view or anything like it is allowed to prevail at the Conference, there is no hope whatever of any reduction of naval estimates and very little hope of any reduction in the total cost of Defence below the present figure of  112,610,000.In this memorandum all figures of numbers nnd tonnage are based on the 1929 Fleet Return (Omd. 3277 of February 1929) unless otherwise stated.[20272]   [20409] B
Mr. Hoover&apos;s Desire for Reduction.Mr. Hoover himself (&quot; Times,&quot; 4th December, 1929), in a Message to Congress, has just referred to the hope of reducing friction in the world and the desire to reduce the great economic burdens of naval armament as the inspiration of the Conference. On the London Conference would depend such moderation in Naval outlay as could be practised. If the United States of America is to be compelled &quot;to undertake the Naval construction implied in the Washington Arms Treaty &apos;&apos; (he appears, says the &quot; Times,&quot; to mean the maintenance of parity with Great Britain) &quot; as well as other Construction, which would appear to be necessary if no international agreement can be completed, we shall be committed during the next 6 years to a construction expenditure of upwards of f 1,200,000,000 ( 240,000,000), besides the necessary further increase in costs for annual upkeep.&quot;Proposed Reduction of Navy Estimates.4. The Treasury urge that the Cabinet should be content with nothing short of a gradual reduction of Navy Estimates over the next 6 years, which will bring them to a figure at least  10 millions a year below the present amount. But they must point out that any such reduction can only be obtained by a drastic revision of the policy contemplated in the Admiralty Memorandum.Analysis of Navy Estimates.5. It will be useful at this stage to analyse the chief elements in Navy Estimates, in order to show what are the prospects of making large savings, and on what points it is necessary to concentrate for the purpose.The Navy Estimates of 1929, amounting to  55,865,000, are composed of four main items :  A.-Pensions, &amp;c.      ... ... ... ...        8,552,900B. Maintenance,   including   pay   and   wages, training, repairs and running expendi-ture, &amp;c       ... ... ... ...      37,390,474C.-Grant-in-Aid of the Fleet Air Arm ... ...        1.300,000&apos;    D.-New Construction ... ... ...        8,621,626Item A is automatically fixed. :.  Item C is under discussion, but cannot at best be made to yield any important saving, in relation to the whole Vote.The hope of really large savings therefore rests on B and D.New Construction Yote the Key.It is usual in discussions on Navy Estimates to concentrate attention on New Construction. The reason for this is that the cost of maintenance depends on the size of the Fleet, and the only hope of achieving a really substantial reduction in the former is by a corresponding reduction in the latter.Reduction in Size of Fleet Essential........A curtailment of New Construction is, therefore, the first step.   But if this represents only a temporary suspension of the normal replacement programme, i.e., if the permanent size of the Fleet remains the same, the Maintenance item will continue unchanged; and as the arrears of New Construction must be caught up sooner or later, the effect on Navy Estimates of such temporary suspension will in the long run be negligible.New Construction Expenditure on various Hypotheses.6. There must, of course, always be a New Construction Vote, if the Fleet is not to be allowed to disappear altogether.   The following Tables show what theCan His MajestyV Government contemplate such a sequel to the MacDonald-Hoover discussions, from which the great principle of .&quot; parity reasonably interpreted &apos;&apos; emerged ?
amount of this Vote is likely to be on certain different assumptions as to the size of the Fleet, and.the size and life of the several classes of ships.(Capital ships and aircraft carriers are ignored in these calculations.)A. Admiralty Plan.Case A assumes the Fleet to be in accordance with the Admiralty proposals, i.e., to consist of 50 cruisers with a normal life of 20 years, 144 destroyers with a life of 16 years, and 55 submarines with a life of 12 years.At an annual cost of&apos; ...   3,200,000 500,00050 cruisers require replacement at the rate of144 destroyers require replacement at the rate of55  submarines  require  replace-ment at the rate of....

Lives of Ships Extended.Case B assumes the Fleet to be of the same size as A, but with the lives of the several classes extended, as proposed in paragraph 13 (VI) below, viz., cruisers, to 24 years; destroyers, to 20 years; submarines, to 15 years.At an annual cost of.   2,533,000&apos; 500,000.   2,400,000500,000 560,000 350,000.   6,843,00050 cruisers replaced at the rate ( 50of      ................I 24144 destroyers replaced at the rate f 14^-71of&apos;        .... .... i 20   555 submarines  replaced  at the f ^ ^. 02rate of ............1 15      miscellaneous craft, sayNormal New Construction Vote= 2-1i2 a year( lira large (  i   small2*large smallC.

These figures show that, under the Admiralty proposals, the average new Construction Vote will never be less than about  8^ millions, i.e., about the same figure as in 1929. If the lives of ships are extended, the cost may be brought down by about  1^- millions. Even if, as in Case C, a much smaller Fleet be assumed, the saving on New Construction alone will be barely  3^ millions per annum.* This gives the normal average expenditure after &quot; stabilisation.&quot; In the immediate future the oobt will be higher, rising to (say)  10,000,000 per annum, owing to exceptional replacement.   See paragraph 17below.[20272]b 2
Reduced Estimates, depend on reducing Fleet.The importance of Case C is that it affects not only the New Construction pro-gramme but also the permanent cost of Maintenance. In Cases A and B the scope for saving is confined to New Construction; the cost of Maintenance will remain very much as it is now, because (as shown below, paragraph 12 (4) ), the size of the Fleet in being will remain practically unchanged.In Case C the reduction in the size of the Fleet will be reflected in a corresponding reduction in the cost of Maintenance, the exact amount of which, the Treasury are not able to estimate, but which should certainly be several million pounds (see paragraph 19 below).It must therefore be repeated that, in order to achieve the desired reduction in the cost of the Navy, it is necessary not merely to suspend the New Construction programme temporarily, but to aim at a permanent reduction in the size of the Fleet below the standard figures assumed by the A dmiralty.The figures assumed for each class of ship in Case C are, of course, taken for the purpose of illustration. The Treasury do not venture to suggest at this stage what should be the ultimate standard.  On this, see paragraph 13 II below.Reduction of Naval Costs vital to this Country.8. In putting forward their present suggestions, the Treasury submit that it is in the best interests of this country, from a naval as well as a financial point of view, to secure an all-round reduction in the size of armaments. Our security in an emergency &quot;depends, in the last resort, on the superiority of our naval forces. But we can no longer afford to spend as much as we have hitherto spent on the Navy; and unless other Powers can be induced to spend less, the danger is lest our pre-eminence should be gradually taken from us, or that an overwhelming burden of expenditure should be imposed upon the taxpayer. Our obvious policy, therefore, would seem to be to do all that we can to encourage an all-round reduction of armaments which save for the acceptance of the principle of parity with the U.S.A. will preserve present relativities generally, but on a level which we can afford. The Conference gives us a peculiarly favourable opportunity to urge this view upon the world, and thereby not only to afford relief to our hard-pressed Exchequer, but to take the lead as the chief practical exponent of the policy of disarmament. Moreover, failing a general reduction of Naval strengths, the &quot;replacement&quot; problem is especially difficult for Great Britain in view of the larger proportion of older ships of all classes in the existing British Fleet.Admiralty Figures should be Maxima.9. The difference between the Naval and the Treasury point of view may be put briefly thus. The Admiralty regard the figures of 50 cruisers and 339,000 tons as the minimum, to be maintained by a systematic programme of replacement. The Treasury contend that they should be treated as maxima, within which we and America may build if we choose, but not necessarily, and that we should aim at reducing our actual strength substantially below those figures in time.Basis of Admiralty Building Plan.10. The Admiralty maintain that their programme follows inevitably from the parity figures, because of the rapid run-out of British cruisers of war-time construction, of which 31 will reach the obsolescence age of 20 years between 1935 and 1939. In the absence of new construction, this would reduce the number of cruisers to 24 by 1939. The Admiralty proposals are therefore designed to spread the burden ovenly over a number of years, so as to avoid a very heavy construction programme later on.Treasury Reply..11. -The Treasury maintain, in reply, ,that this is an unnecessary and extravagant interpretation of the doctrine of parity. It would in fact constitute -a repetition of the unfortunate sequel to the &quot;Washington Conference of 1922.
Sequel to &quot;Limitation &quot; of Cruisers, 1922, was Building Competition.The &quot; limitationof cruisers to 10,000 tons and 8-iheh guns laid down by that Conference, from which so much was hoped, was followed directly by a very large competitive output of cruisers of or nearly up to the maximum type allowed, led by the British Empire with 15* (including 2 of 8,400 tons, but excluding 4 of maximum size, but with 7-5-inch guns, previously laid down). Japan has now laid down 12 (including 4 of 7,100 tons). TJ.S.A. laid down 8 between 1926 and 1928 and now &quot;projects&quot; 15, all 23 being of the maximum tonnage and armament. (Of the 15 &quot; projected&quot; ships it is understood that two are in fact already under construc-tion, since the date of the Fleet Return 1929.) The U.S.A. did not lay down a single 8-inch cruiser until 1926; but when our unnecessarily large programme at last stirred her into rivalry, her full programme in its turn outdistances ours.The moral is that programme begets programme and competition breeds competition, with no advantage to either side in the end.Dangers of similar Rivalry: Proposals of the Nations.12. That there is a real danger lest a similar rivalry should follow the present Conference is evident from a study of the proposals of the different nations so far as they are known.(1.) U.S.A.The U.S.A. has at present built and building (including the 2 ships of the 15-cruiser programme, but excluding ships of 20 years old and upwards) only 20 cruisers totalling 170,000 tons. She claims to be allowed to build at least an additional 8-10,000-ton 8-inch cruisers, bringing her total to 28 ships, all but 10 of the largest size, of 250,000 tonnage in all. Her full &quot; parity&quot; figure, corresponding to ours of 339,000, is understood tp approach 315,000. Her present number built is only 10-6-inch ships, total tonnage 70,000,t and 1-S-inch ship of lO,000 tons completed since the date of the Fleet Return.(2.) Japan.Japan has 33 cruisers built and building of 215,000 tons in all, including 12 with 8-inch guns; and if the U.S.A. build more than 8 more with 8-inch guns, Japan is certain to claim to increase her number of that class also.(3.) France.France is setting the pace in submarines, of which she has just launched a new type of a size (3,250 tons), range of action, and equipment, greater than that of any other Power! She has 41 submarines (within the official age limit) built (34,000 tons), 40 building (48,000 tons), and 13 projected (18,000 tons).(4.) British Empire. Qlaim that we are Reducing is Unfounded.The draft British programme is claimed by the Admiralty to represent a great reduction in comparison with the 70 cruisers and 450,000 tonnage which were taken as the final figures at the Geneva Conference of 1927.Paper Reductions; Real Increases,The Treasury contend, however, that the Admiralty programme is only a paper reduction, and actually represents an increase over present strength, or at least a stabilisation of very recent increases, on these grounds : /- \   T- &quot;vr___l___i r\cn   /&quot;SXT^      --J^/x^n^^^ &quot; j-^+qI no^niT-arn^f &apos;J wag-i-Xi        WCliiUiSi    i fJXJX.   \ 1V cioxiXiig viitAJ UOOiiJiioy   uu. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;   &apos; ^-&quot;rT!&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;--&apos;put at 50. As noted in C.I.D. 815-B of the 6th July, 1927, Lord Balfour telegraphed : &quot; The grand total of cruisers for fleet purposes and for other purposes was put by Earl Beatty tentatively at 50.&quot;The figures of 70 &quot;ships and 450,000 tons have never existed, save on paper ; no Government has ever accepted them as the basis of a building programme; and they&apos;   &apos; * Excluding 2 of 1928 programme, since cancelled.f Fleet return 90,000, but U.8.A. contest this.[20272] Sill!!: B 3
could not have been built and maintained without ah increase in Navy Estimates, which no Government could have defended in a time of peace.(ii.) According to the Fleet returns, we had in 1923 Only 259,000 tons of cruiser tonnage, built and building; 52 ships in all (excluding.&quot; Courageous&quot; and &quot; Glorious,&quot; now converted to aircraft carriers).But at no time since 1922 till 1929 have we had as many as 50 ships actually built, or a tonnage of more than 250;000.* It is only the over-production of 10,000-ton 8-inch cruisers, to which separate reference is made in paragraph 11 of this Memorandum, which has raised the figure to the neighbourhood of 300,000 in 1929.(iii.) The building programme over the next 5 years is actually more expensive than that carried out by the Conservative Government.(iv.) The man-power of the Navy is expected by the Admiralty to rise from 94,000 (1st April. 1930) to 97,000 in later years.(v.) The new ships of about 6,500 tons will be&quot; replacing&quot; ships of about 4,000 tons, apart from the premature scrapping of the 4 &quot;Hawkins.&quot;(vi.) The figure of 50 cruisers which the Admiralty aim at reaching by 1936 appears to relate to completed cruisers only, and to exclude ships building oh that date. Nothing is said in the Admiralty memorandum of new building in 1934, 1935 and 1936; but unless there is to be an entire change of policy in those years, it is assumed that the Admiralty will recommend the continued laying-down of at least 3 cruisers a year, to replace obsolescent ships. The total number built and building on that date will therefore be approximately the same as now shown in the Fleet Return, viz., 59.tProposed British Policy.13. The Treasury submit, therefore, that the British representatives should recommend to the Conference the adoption of the following- principles :  I. Immediate and Substantial Reductions of Ships and Expenditure.I. That the object of the Conference is to secure an immediate and substantial reduction in (a) the number and (&amp;) the size of all classes of fighting ships, accom-panied by (c) a reduction in the naval budgets of the Five Powers.II. Further Conference in 1936*II. That with this in mind the &quot; parity figures &quot; to be laid down should not be used for the purpose of building programmes up to the parity figures, but that the ultimate actual sizes of all the fleets shall be reserved for a further Conference to be convened in (say) 1936.III.-Restriction of New Building, &amp;c. ,.HI. That, in the meanwhile, subject, as regards U.S.A., to the reservation below in paragraph 16, the Powers should be asked to agree (a) to lay down no ships for a short period;(b) to scrap an agreed number of existing ships of each class, irrespective of age,in each year;* British Cruisers actually built (20 years and under).Fleet Return.

But this, of course, would necessitate a sharp rise in expenditure, and this consideration alone, it is hoped, may act as a check on Governments accustomed to a low level of naval, estimates over the previous 5 years.Sketch Scheme for British Reductions.14. As regards the number of ships to be scrapped and the number and size of those to be replaced in each class by the various Powers (Principle III (&amp;) and (c)), the Treasury do not of course claim to be competent to work out a scheme in detail, but they suggest, quite tentatively, the following as a possible guide for British ships! .The object of this tentative scheme is to show how it might be possible, if other Powers follow suit proportionately, to apply the principles laid down in paragraph 13 in practice so as to reduce the numbers to a lower level by 1936, while keeping the new construction Vote at a steady level of about  4-^ millions a year :: (a.) Cruisers. To scrap 2 in each of the years 1930-35 (making 12 in all, including the 4 &quot;Hawkins,&quot; if this is unavoidable), and to lay down 1 and 2 alternately in each of the years 1932-35 (making 6 in all). This would bring our numbers down to 53 built and building in 1936.For the present, new cruisers not to exceed, say, 4,500 tons.(b.) Destroyers (including Flotilla Leaders). To scrap 12 in each of the years 1930-35, and lay down 6 in each year from 1931-35, size of new ships not to exceed 1 375 tons.   This would bring our numbers down to 132 built and building in 1936.(c.) Submarines; (if retained). To scrap at least 6 in each year 1930-35, and lay down not more than 3 in each year from 1931-35; size of new ships not &quot;to exceed (say) 750 tons.* It is realised that, in the case of vessels-- of war-time construction, such extension may not be possible without wasteful expenditure on repairs. Some allowance for war user mig-ht be made to meet this difficulty. But the new&apos; principle should be applied to all new construction, as was in fact approved by thy Cabinet &quot;in 1927. &apos;;
4,480,000pr less than one-half of the Admiralty programme consisting of :  3 large cruisers ... ... ...      4,800,0009 Destroyers ... ... ... ...      3,000,0002 large, 4 small, Submarines   ... ...      1,840,000Miscellaneous, sav      ... ... ... 350,0009,990,000No allowance is made in either of these tables for replacement of Capital Ships or Aircraft Carriers.Reductions of Navy Estimates under Treasury Plan.18. Put in another way, the new construction Vote, now about  8^ millions and estimated under the Admiralty programme to reach  10 millions in two years&apos; time, need not for the present exceed  4&apos;! millions.To enable this reduction to be reached at an early date, the full new programme must not begin till the old programmes 1925-28 are nearly completed. These will cost  5 millions in the financial year 1930 and  f million in 1931. Accordingly, it is proposed that there should be a complete naval holiday in 1930, subject to the exception of the United States as mentioned above; that the Destroyer and Submarine replacement shall not commence until 1931, and the cruiser replacement not before 1932, thus stabilising the Vote as nearly as possible over the whole periodConsequent Reductions in Maintenance Costs.19.   Besides an ultimate reduction of  4 millions on the present directl expenditure on new construction, the above policy should, as pointed out iilf paragraph 7 above, save very large sums on maintenance of the Fleet (numbers oif officers and men, reserves of armaments, stores, oil, &amp;c).&apos;     (d.) Summarised, the net reductions by the end of 1935 will be . 6 Cruisers (4,000 tons average). . 42 Destroyers (1,000 tons average). 21 Submarines (600 tons average).pt.jb.er Countries to follow Suit.15. If. the general principle is accepted, similar schemes could be worked out for other countries, subject to exceptional treatment for the U.S.A., as suggested in the following paragraph.Exceptional Position of U.S.A.16. In the case of the U.S. A. the difference between actual cruiser tonnage and any conceivable &quot; parity figure &quot; is so wide that she must be allowed, if she wishes, to build toward the parity figure. But Mr. Hoover&apos;s Message to Congress, referred to above, suggests that she may be willing to waive, at least in part, her rights in this respect, if she is not challenged to. further competition.Normal Cost of Replacement under Treasury Proposals.17. This scheme aims at a normal annual replacement programme up to 1936 of :-&apos; &apos; Cost. H Cruisers (4,000 or 4,500 tons) ... ...      1,500,0006 Destroyers (1,375 tons)         ... ...      2,100,0003 Submarines &quot; S &quot; (642 tons)   ... ...         630,000Miscellaneous (average, say)    ... ...         250,000
The Treasury do not venture themselves to put any precise figure on these savings, but they hope that a reduction in the size of the Fleet as envisaged above should permit of a saving on maintenance of between  3 and  4 millions, if not more. Adding the saving on new construction; and other administrative savings which the Admiralty themselves have in mind, the Treasury hope that the Navy Estimates may be brought down to approximately  46 millions by 1936, as compared with the present total of just under  56 millions.They repeat, however, that their plan does not stop short at the above figures, but envisages the hope of still further reductions in the size of the Fleet as the result of the proposed second Conference in 1936.Conclusion: Alternatives before the Government.20. The Treasury fully realise that their proposals involve a certain risk, since we shall be left, during the years following 1936, with a higher proportion of old war-time cruisers than other nations, whose fleets will be mainly of post-war construction. It is hoped that some solution for this difficulty may be found at the Conference, if other Powers can be induced to scrap prematurely some of their post-war vessels, in return for the sacrifices which we shall be making. But, however this may be, the Treasury feel bound to represent that the Government are faced with a choice between two grave and apparently inescapable alternatives. Either they must accept such a risk, for the sake of a real step forward towards disarmament, or they must abandon all hope of seeing any reduction whatever in Navy Estimates, and in all probability in the cost of Defence as a whole, for the next 6 years at least.21. In conclusion, the Treasury urge that the Admiralty be instructed immediately to prepare, for consideration by the Government, an alternative plan in detail, in conformity with the general principles indicated in this Memorandum.December 16, 1929.o
