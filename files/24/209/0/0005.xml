PART I.AIM OF CONFERENCE.THE aim of the Conference has been defined by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom as follows :  - &apos; to attain agreement between the Powers represented at the Conference on the reduction and limitation of war vessels on the basis of mutually accepted strength. The date by which it is proposed that this agreed equilibrium should be reached is the 31st December, 1936., and this basis of agreed strength should, it is suggested, regulate the navies of the several Powers until it has been revised at a later Conference.This definition has not yet been accepted by the other Powers.2. The following is a summary of the proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are proposing to submit to the Conference, together with an outline of the: attitude which the foreign Delegations are likely to adopt towards these proposals.The summary is prepared oh the basis that any agreement which may be reached at the forthcoming Conference would be related to the naval forces of all parts of the British Empire, and throughout the memorandum, when it is desired to indicate the total of such forces, the term &quot; British Empire &quot; is used.Capital Ships.3. Reduction in the size of-future capital ships from 35,000 to 25,000 tons individual displacement, and consequently a reduction in the maximum total tonnage to 375,000 tons for U.S.A. and the British Empire.Reduction in the calibre of guns in. capital ships from the present limit of 16 inches to 12 inches.Extension of the accepted life of future capital ships from twenty to twenty-six years; extension of the life of existing ships and a rearrangement of the replacement tables agreed upon at Washington so as to extend the period over which replacement is to take place. Modified replacement tables to be drawn up, being framed so as to avoid, if possible, a greater rate of replacement than one ship a year for the British Empire and United States of America and pro raid for Japan, but account to be taken of the necessity for preserving the equilibrium in capital ship strengths, with which is connected the year in which it may be agreed to begin replacement. The latter consideration cannot, moreover, be disassociated from the question of the greatest age which could be accepted for existing capital ships.The probable attitude of other Powers towards these proposals will, it is considered, be as follows : U.S.A. will object to the reduction in size and gun power, but might possibly be brought to agree if pressed very hard and if their own counter-proposal (see below) is not accepted. They feel that the present high limitation makes the cost prohibitive for lesser nations, thus enhancing the relative power of the U.S.A. and the British Empire, and also that they have a good gun in the 16-inch gun. Further-more, it is understood that they have a large number of these guns in stock, which were made for the capital ships scrapped as a result of the Washington Treaty.Their counter-proposal will probably be to suspend further building in this category during the period of the present agreement, i.e., until the 31st December, 1936, on the ground that they are not yet satisfied that capital ships are a type to be perpetuated, in view of their cost and their possible vulnerability to air attack; Our objection to this proposal for suspension is that it leads to dislocation in the dock-yards and too long a life for some of our ships. We desire to spread replacement, commencing before 1936.Japan will probably agree to reduction in size, but is understood to favour reduction to a 14-inch gun rather than to a 12-inch gun. It might be possible to get agreement on a reduction to a 14-inch-gun ship, representing a compromise between ourselves and the U.S.A. and meeting Japan, but a bigger ship than that proposed by us will be required if it is to carry 14-inch guns.
&quot;Frorece--Under the provisions of the Washington Treaty, France and Italy were accorded the right of employing their capital ship tonnage allotment as they might consider advisable, subject solely to the limitations that the displacement of individual ships should not surpass 35,000 tons, and that the total tonnage should keep within the limits imposed by the treaty. Although it is very desirable that France and Italy should be bound by the same restrictions as the remaining Powers, it is not considered advisable to introduce this subject at-the Conference, as it would certainly cause friction. It is considered that the matter can best be adjusted when the subject again comes up at the Disarmament Conference.France and Italy were allotted the same total tonhage and one that bore a ratio of 1-67 to the 5 allotted to the British Empire and U.S.A. She may ask for an increased ratio of 5: 2.This should be opposed, as it is desired only to reduce the burden of replaee-ment by the adoption of lower displacement and gun calibre limits and longer lives, on the lines of our proposal, and not to recast the Treaty, such as would be required by any alteration of relative strengths. Relative strengths form the basis of the treaty and are bound up with the provision whereby the British Empire, U.S.A. and Japan agree to maintain the status quo in the Pacific with regard to fortifications and naval bases other than in the Home countries.Italy is in a similar position to France and will probably adopt a like attitude. In addition, she may propose a naval holiday, as she has no present intention of herself undertaking any capital ship construction......Aircraft Carriers.4. Reduction in the size of aircraft carriers from 27,000 to 25,000 tons individual displacement, and, consequently, a reduction in the maximum total tonnage to 125,000 tons.Extension of the life for new construction of aircraft carriers to 26 years.U.S.A. will probably suggest a reduction in maximum total tonnage to 120,000 tons, and will propose a higher minimum individual displacement to prevent aircraft carriers dropping into the cruiser category, and so upsetting the equilibrium in that category. Our figure of 125,000 tons best meets our own probable requirements.U.S.A. are themselves proposing to build an aircraft carrier of 13,800 tons. A proposal to raise the present minimum limit of 10,000 tons to, say, 13,000 tons Avould clash with the Japanese desire to build smaller aircraft carriers. This point is dealt with under the heading &quot;Auxiliary War Vessels &quot; (paragraph 5).Japan may agree, but will probably propose a new category for &quot; Aircraft Carriers under 10,000 tons.&quot;   This is remarked upon below.FItalye ) wiU PrQbably agree to our proposals.Division of Auxiliary War Vessels into Three Categories, and Transfer of Tonnagebetween Categories.5. Limitation of remaining types of war vessels in three categories, namely, cruisers, destroyers and submarines, making 5 categories in all. Vessels not falling within these categories to form the subject of special agreement.As a concession to the views of France and Italy, who do not favour division into categories, but prefer a single total (or global) tonnage for the fleet, we are prepared to accept the transfer of a percentage of category tonnage allotments being made between certain adjacent categories.In our view the transfer percentage should be limited to 10 per cent., and should be permitted only between submarines and destroyers, and between destroyers and the smaller class cruisers. Transfer to the 8-inch class of cruiser would upset the agreed equilibrium, and transfer to capital ships and aircraft carriers would not conform to the provisions of the Washington Treaty.The objection to a larger transfer percentage, or, in fact, to any transfer, is that it tends to upset the equilibrium effected by the treaty and thus raise doubts as to security.U.S.A. will agree. (&quot;202541 b 2
present they are aiming at 70 per cent, of the U.S.A. 8-inch cruiser tonnage and 70 per cent, in the total tonnage of auxiliary craft, and propose to balance, their large submarine tonnage demands by cutting down their 6-inch cruiser and destroyer -tonnages.They give as reasons for their claim the length of their coastline, the large number of their nationals abroad, the necessity for import of food and raw materials and low shipbuilding capacity. It is believed, however, that their real reasons are strategical, and that their aim is to render the U.S.A. unable to produce a superior fleet in Japanese waters.This question is also discussed in Part II of this memorandum.As regards France, she will probably, if persuaded to accept a cruiser category, demand freedom to build as she desires, as her present intentions are to construct only 10,000-ton 8-inch cruisers. Eventually it is possible that she may agree to -an 8-inch and a 6-inch allotment for the period up to the end of 1936, in view of her existing vessels of these types, that is, of course, if she can be induced to sign an agreement as to numbers at all. It is difficult to forecast her attitude as to the &apos;&apos; yardstick.&apos;&apos; On the one hand, it gives a certain increased measure of freedom; on the other hand, it probably will be objectionable as favouring Italy, who is building the smaller type; on the whole, it may be expected that France wall not favour the &quot;yardstick.&quot;She will probably demand an increased ratio on the Washington 5:1- 67, based on such factors as length of coastline and length of communication to her colonies. According to our view these are only two of several factors which include the vital nature of the communications, the volume of traffic on these routes and their geo-graphical relation to potential dangers. It is considered that a compromise figure -of 5 : 2 might be accepted as reasonable, and as this is more or less based on the &quot;status quo &quot; it may be possible to avoid any actual expression of cruiser ratios.Italy, if persuaded to agree to a cruiser category, will probably be more agreeable to our proposals than France will be, as she is herself building a 5,000-ton 6-inch gun type of cruiser and so will benefit by the &quot;yardstick.&quot; She will demand parity with France.Note. &quot;6-inch cruiser &quot; and &quot;6-inch allotment&quot; (and similar terms) are used in this memorandum for the sake of brevity to refer to the smaller type of cruiser, though the modern French and Japanese ships of this type are actually armed with 6-1-inch and 5-5-inch guns respectively.Destroyers.7. Limitation of the maximum total tonnage for the destroyer category at 200.000 tons, of which, only 16 per cent, may be utilised for destroyer leaders. This total tonnage will be reduced, if it is possible to obtain agreement on a low sub-marine total tonnage.Washington ratios to apply to the Five Powers in destroyer tonnage.Limitation of maximum individual displacement of destroyer leaders and destroyers at 1,850 and 1,500 tons respectively.Guns in the destroyer category to be limited to 5 inches.Fixing of the life of the destroyer category at 16 years.U.S.A. They are in general agreement with us, and difficulties are not anticipated:Japan also is likely to be in general agreement, as our proposals follow the lines of the provisional agreement of the Coolidge Conference.France is likely to raise objections to the proposed individual displacement limits, as she is building&apos; larger vessels herself, which would have to be included in the cruiser category if she accepted our figures. She will probably propose a maximum individual displacement of 3,000 tons, and may receive U.S.A. support, as this was the U.S.A. proposed figure at the Coolidge Conference. This would not suit us, as we can build the type we require on the lower figure, and, if forced to increase our size, would consequently be increasing instead of reducing our burden. France will also probably prove difficult over the gun, as she is at present installing 5-5-inch guns. She will, also, probably object to the sub-division into Destroyer Leaders and Destroyers, as she is not at present building according to this
relationship, the majority of her new vessels being of the larger type. Furthermore, she will maintain that this sub-division really introduces another category. It is possible that we may be able to arrange a compromise for future construction, on the ground of desirability for reduction of size of types, whilst accepting for the present figures high enough to include the French vessels.Italy. Her attitude may be expected&apos; to be somewhat similar to France as to size and sub-division, though accepting a lower figure for size. As regards guns, she will probably accept the 5-inch limit.As in the cruiser category, both France and Italy will probably press for a ratio greater than the Washington ratio.Submarines.8. Abolition of the submarine. We recognise, however, other Powers desire to retain this category. Failing abolition, we desire to fix the total tonnage at the lowest possible figure.Washington ratios to apply to the five Powers in submarines, but we would be prepared to agree to some modification of this ratio for Japan, France and Italy, if necessary, for agreement.Limitation of maximum individual displacement for submarines at 1,800 tons. Guns in the submarine category to be limited to 5 inches.Fixing of life of submarines at 13 years.U.S.A. will support our proposals.Japan will oppose abolition, and will demand 80,000 tons in this category. She may again raise the question of submarines under 600 tons being treated as coming within the exempt class.France will oppose abolition. She will probably require a figure of about 90,000 tons for this category.Italy will seek parity with France. She might agree to abolition by general consent of all nations.Transfer.9.   Transfer has been dealt with in paragraph 5.Exempt Vessels.10. It is not anticipated that there will be any serious difficulty in reaching agreement on the conditions for exempt vessels, though each power will try to obtain a formula suited to its own particular types. Agreement was reached in the Coolidge Conference. ^ There may, however, be some argument over the special treatment of certain existing vessels that do not fall conveniently within any category and cannot be treated as exempt class.
PART II.In this Section it is proposed to discuss more fully some of the principal obstacles which the Conference will have to overcome.Bridging of the Gap of 30,000 tons of 8-inch Cruiser Tonnage between the British Empire and the United States.The position reached in our negotiations with the United States is as follows : 2. We have informed the United States Government unofficially that we are prepared to accept a minimum of 339,000 tons as the tonnage at which our cruiser strength will stand on the 31st December, 1936, on the understanding that there shall be substantial reductions in the contemplated cruiser strength of other Powers and that there shall be a further conference before 1936 to decide upon the naval strengths to be maintained after that date.   This figure is made up of : British Empire- Tons.Fifteen 8-inch ships ... ... 146,800Fourteen new 6-inch ships   ... ... ...        90,720Twenty-one older 6-inch ships ... ... 101,4803. The United States, taking the above figures as a basis, consider that, in order to achieve parity with the British Empire, their cruiser fleet would have to be constituted by 1936 as follows : United States- Tons.Twenty-one 8-inch gun ships ... ... 210,000Ten Omahas          ...         ... ... ... 70,500Five 6,900-ton 6-inch gun ships ... ... 34,500making a total of 315,000 tons.4. We have indicated to the United States Government that we could not regard the above figures as constituting parity.  If the British and American figuresfiven above are reduced by a &quot; yardstick &apos;&apos; oasis, it will be found that the United tates only agree to a discount in our favour of 24,000 tons on a total American tonnage of 315,000 tons. Expressed differently, this means that one ton of 8-inch cruiser tonnage equals 1 - 38 tons of 6-inch cruiser tonnage, or one 10,000-ton 8-inch cruiser would be regarded as the equivalent of two 6,900-ton 6-inch cruisers. This is unacceptable as a basis of a parity agreement with the United States for it would give the United States a comfortable fighting superiority. Moreover, if the United States Government were to retain twenty-one 8-inch gun cruisers, the Japanese could clearly not rest content with their present programme of twelve 8-inch gun cruisers, totalling 108,400 tons, since this would give them only 51 per cent, of the American 8-inch gun cruiser tonnage. Japan demands a ratio of 70 per cent, of United States 8-inch cruiser tonnage, and to achieve this she would, if the United States retains twenty-one, require to build four more 9,650-ton 8-inch cruisers, thus acquiring sixteen 8-inch ships as against the projected fifteen for the British Empire. This is a position which public opinion in the British Empire in general, and in Australia in particular, would be most unlikely to accept. If, however, the United States could be induced to reduce the number of their 8-inch gun cruisers from twenty-one to eighteen, Japan, with her existing programme of Twelve, would have 67 per cent, of United States 8-inch cruiser strengthen numbers and 60 per cent, in tonnage. (For further observations on Japanese claim to 70 per cent, of cruiser tonnage, see separate section below.)5. From every point of view, therefore, we have an interest in inducing the United States Government to come down to eighteen 8-inch-gun cruisers.6. As a result of the conversations which took place during the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Washington, it is felt that there is no hope at all of inducing the United States Government to agree that parity with the minimum British Empire cruiser strength indicated above could be achieved by a programme of eighteen 8-inch gun 10,000-ton cruisers and fifteen 6-inch gun 7,000-ton cruisers. It was discovered however, that there was a possibility that the U.S.A. would agree to a figure oi 285,000 tons, consisting of eighteen 8-inch and fifteen 8-inch, pi
reduced our 6-inch tonnage so as to give us a total tonnage of 325,000 tons. The U.S. Navy Board would probably press for 15,000 additional tons of 6-inch, making the U.S.A. figure 300,000 tons, but Mr. Hoover is anxious to avoid the considerable amount of new construction represented by this figure, and it seems possible that his figure might prevail.It should be here explained that the number of fifty cruisers is considerably below the number estimated by the Admiralty as necessary to meet full requirements. It is regarded as an absolute minimum and acceptable for the purposes of this agree-ment only in view of the prevailing international conditions. Consequently, the only way of reducing our total cruiser tonnage below the figure of 339,000 tons, at which it now stands, would be either to reduce the number of replacement cruisers, keeping older and smaller cruisers in their place, or to reduce the size of a certain number of the replacement cruisers.The Foreign Office have reason to believe that, if, by a combination of these two methods, the figure of 339,000 tons could be reduced by 14,000 tons of 6-inch tonnage by (a) retaining two more of the older cruisers than at present contemplated, thus reducing the replacement programme from fourteen to twelve, and (b) constructing the twelve replacement cruisers with a lower average tonnage that at present contem-plated, i.e:, 5,700 instead of 6,500 tons, the U.S. Government would be able to reduce their programme of 8-inch construction from twenty-one to eighteen, without adding to their proposed number of fifteen 6-inch cruisers.7.   The process of calculation would be somewhat as follows :  The &apos;&apos; yardstick &quot; as it stands has been shown above to work out at 1 ton of 8-inch tonnage to 1-38 tons of 6-inch tonnage. On the basis of equivalent tonnage, a reduction of 14,000 tons of British 6-inch tonnage would permit a reduction of approximately 10,000 tons of American 8-inch tonnage, leaving 20,000 tons to be disposed of. To balance the very serious concession represented by our reduction of 14,000 tons of 6-inch tonnage below our minimum and the retention of two older ships, the United States would be expected to wipe out the remaining 20,000 tons of 8-inch tonnage by modifying their &quot; yardstick &quot; in our favour, so that 1 ton of 8-inch tonnage would equal 2 - 2 tons of 6-inch tonnage. The state of equilibrium between 8-inch and 6-inch tonnage would thus be placed at one 10,000-ton 8-inch cruiser being the equivalent of about three 7,000-ton 6-inch cruisers. The Foreign Office represent that any such increase in the &apos;&apos; yardstick &apos;&apos; ratio in our favour would constitute a serious concession on the part of the United States Government and one which that Government could only offer by overruling the Navy Board. Under this proposal the two cruiser fleets would stand in 1936 as follows : British 15 35	Empire  8-inch-gun 6-inch-gun	cruisers ... cruisers ...	Tons. 146,800 178,20050	cruisers		325,000United 18 15	States  8-inch-gun 6-inch-gun	cruisers ... cruisers ...	180,000 105,00033	cruisers		285,0008. The Admiralty view of the above is that even the new proposed yardstick ratio is too low, and, further, that we are not in a position to reduce the number of replacement cruisers, keeping older and smaller cruisers in their place. Under our proposals, we are scrapping four large and eighteen small cruisers in order to achieve the 1936 position. Of the eighteen, fifteen would have in any case to be scrapped, being at the end of their life, and, owing to their war-time work, they are worn out and there is no possibility of extending their life. The other three, though inefficient, might possibly be made to last until 1937 instead of being scrapped in 1936. If, however, we were to carry these over to 1937, it would mean that six of our war-time cruisers would have to be replaced in that year and six in the following-year. A heavy building programme would be necessary to maintain our numbers, and the very difficulty which it is sought now to avoid by including in our total cruiser strength, only the number of older cruisers which we have suggested, would occur then with greater emphasis.
17. There remains the question of the reduction of the average size of the replacement cruisers to 5,700 tons. This has the disadvantage, from our point of view, that the 5,700-ton type is considerably inferior in power to existing United States and French 6-inch cruisers and in general the tendency of these Powers is to build 6-inch-gun cruisers, of an average displacement of 6,500 to 7,000 tons. It is-for this reason that the Admiralty have provided the 6,500/7,000-ton ship as the replacement type. Already we must have nineteen of our cruisers of an average size of 4,500 tons, and we cannot have the remainder of our 6-inch cruisers of a type inferior to those of the other Powers.9. It should be borne in mind that under our present proposals our cruiser strength in 1936 will be : 15 8-inch, 14 new 6-inch, 2 E class,19 older 6-inch, averaging 4,500 tons each, that is to say, 38 per cent, of our number of cruisers are of 4,500 tons.10. This is as high a proportion of small ships as the Admiralty consider should be accepted. After 1936, if the same standard of strength prevails, we shall only be able to replace these ships ton for ton. A further reduction of total tonnage would mean their replacement by an even smaller type unsuitable to our requirements.11. We have learnt confidentially that the age factor in the American &quot;yardstick&quot; operates more potently in our favour than the factors of gun calibre and displacement. The Admiralty consider, however, that the use of an age factor is objectionable, and that it is most undesirable that undue emphasis should be placed on this factor, since this would in later years disturb the equilibrium established in 1936.13. Whereas an age factor might now operate in our favour and produce a parity which is acceptable, in later years the process would be reversed, and by the operation of the age factor we might be prevented from obtaining our numbers on the limited tonnage, while the U.S.A. would be able to increase theirs.The yardstick should depend mainly upon the essential characteristics which differentiate the types required by the two navies, namely, the small 6-inch and the large 8-inch gun types. An age factor does not do this; properly speaking, it allows a depreciation for age applicable equally to 6-inch and 8-inch-gun ships alike.14. The &quot; yardstick &quot; was originally designed, so we were given to understand at Geneva in April last, to take account of the different requirements of the two countries, thus reconciling the U.S.A. demand for &quot;parity&quot; and our special needs. The emphasis now laid upon the age factor by the United States of America represents a tendency to depart from that attitude.15. Acceptance of the proposal that we should include two more older cruisers in our 1936 strength would not necessarily involve introducing an actual age factor into the yardstick formula, and in the calculations which have been set out above no such factor has been included.16. If, therefore, it should prove necessary to take account of the age of certain of our ships in order to establish an equilibrium in cruiser strength in 1936, it is most desirable to secure agreement with the United States delegation that an actual age factor is not used in the yardstick formula, or at least that, if used, it should subsequently be discarded, and that, thereafter, replacements should be on the basis of ton for ton and type for type.20. The Foreign Office proposal outlined above would depend for its success on the United States Government being left in no doubt up to the last that the figure of 339,000 tons represents our minimum requirement for cruiser tonnage, and that any reduction below that level would represent a vital concession which could only be made in return for some similarly vital concession by the United States. The preliminary negotiation of a settlement with the Unitea States delegates on these
lines is a matter for treatment outside rather than inside the Conference, and at a very early stage of the proceedings. Its success would mean the elimination of a problem which, since the Geneva Conference of 1927, has been regarded as well-nigh insoluble.Japanese Claim to 70 per Cent. Ratio of Cruiser Tonnage.21. The circumstances connected with the claim put forward by the Japanese Government at the Washington Conference to a ratio of 10 : 10 : 7 in respect of capital ships and aircraft carriers and their eventual acceptance of a 10 : 10 : 6 ratio is given in Part III (page 16). History is repeating itself, for the Japanese are now putting forward a very strong claim to a 70 per cent, ratio in respect of the 8-inch-gun cruiser tonnage of the Power having the largest such tonnage. They are prepared to accept a lower ratio in 6-inch-gun cruiser tonnage, but as against this are stated in the press to demand parity with the United States and ourselves in submarines. In other words the Japanese demand is for a 70 per cent, ratio to cover cruisers, destroyers and submarines, the essential elements being 70 per cent, of the strongest navy in 8-inch tonnage and 100 per cent, of the strongest navy in submarines, the necessary adjustment to be made in 6-inch cruiser tonnage and destroyers tonnage to bring the whole auxiliary craft tonnage down to a 70 per cent, basis.22. This demand is embarrassing in a number of ways. Even if an agreement between the United States and ourselves were possible in which each side retained an equal number of 8-inch ships, neither we nor the United States would agree willingly to a position which would mean a definite accretion of naval strength to Japan, seeing that her present 8-inch cruiser strength is only 62 per cent, of ours and her strength in the whole cruiser category only 51 per cent, of ours. But it has been seen that an agreement with the United States can only be based on the acceptance of an unequal amount of 8-inch cruiser tonnage, the American preponderance in 8-inch tonnage being set off by a still higher British Empire preponderance in 6-inch tonnage. The Japanese claim to 70 per cent, of the strongest Power would, if granted, give Japan a virtual equality in this type of cruiser with the British Empire, and this would be unacceptable to us and particularly to Australia. If we succeed in our effort to reduce the American figure for 8-inch cruisers from 21 to 18, the situation would be eased considerably, but we should still be unable to grant the Japanese claim to 70 per cent, of U.S.A. in 8-inch-gun cruisers. If the United States 8-inch cruiser strength is fixed at 18 (180,000 tons) and ours at 15 (146,800 tons), the highest figure which we could accept in the case of Japan would be 12 (108,400 tons), i.e., the number of Japanese cruisers of this class built and building. This would give Japan 60 per cent of United States 8 inch tonnage and 67 per cent, of the number of United States 8-inch cruisers. Under the same arrangement Japan would have 80 per cent, of our numbers and 74 per cent, of our tonnage in 8-inch cruisers  a situation vis-a-vis the British Empire upon which Japan cannot reasonably expect to improve. We could perhaps agree to give Japan a somewhat higher ratio than 60 per cent, of the total British cruiser, destroyer and submarine tonnage combined, provided that she accepts a 60 per cent, ratio for the 3-inch type of ship. Such an offer will certainly not satisfy the Japanese in their present frame of mind, but they would probably accept it in the end if they can see no hope of getting anything better. If it is to be made, it might be wiser to make no mention of it at the present stage, but to hold it in reserve for the conference itself.23. The Japanese Ambassador here has stated that this 70 per cent, claim is based on the length of the Japanese coast-line, the large number of his countrymen living in China who have to be protected, the necessity under which Japan laboured to import food and raw material, and her low capacity for the rapid building of ships in case of urgent need.All these considerations (except the last) apply with equal force to this country, and yet we are preparing to accept less than parity with the United States in the 8-inch-gun cruiser in return for compensation elsewhere. Moreover, the fact remains that our acceptance at Washington of parity with the United States in capital ships was based on the assumption that Japan&apos;s ratio was to be 60 per cent. Our present acceptance of parity with the United States in auxiliary craft has been based on the same assumption.
24. If we do not now reject parity with the United States in cruiser and auxiliary craft, Japan can with less reason reject 60 per cent, of United States strength in the same tonnage. Both we and the United States are making sacrifices in order to secure agreement and reductions, and Japan may reasonably be invited to convert into other tonnage the 17,600 tons of additional 8-inch-cruiser tonnage which she says she must claim if the United States figure is to remain at 180,000 tons.25. The Japanese Government appear to believe that a solution of this particular difficulty should be sought in a reduction of the British Empire cruiser strength below the minimum at present proposed of 339,000 tons, and they have been urging the United States Government to put pressure on His Majesty&apos;s Government to bring this about. But this method offers no hope of a solution. Even if we and the United States were both to reduce by one 8-inch cruiser to 17 and 14 respectively, we should have to require the Japanese figure to be reduced to 11, and Japan would, therefore, be no nearer to achieving her 70 per cent, ratio than before. As regards 6-inch cruiser tonnage, it is clear that no reduction greater than the 14,000-ton reduction, which has already been discussed and to which the Admiralty have objection, could in any circumstances be contemplated.26. It follows from the above that it will be impossible for the Japanese claim to be granted in respect of 8-inch tonnage without (a) increasing Japan&apos;s existing naval strength relative to the British Empire and the United States, and (b) upsetting the whole structure of our proposed agreement with the United States.Franco-Italian Ratio.27. Under the Washington Treaty the ratios for capital ships were placed at 5 for the British Empire and the United States, 3 for Japan, 1-67 for France and Italy. France has never been satisfied with this ratio and will undoubtedly demand a higher one for cruisers. It is probable that some reasonable increase, say, up to 5.5.2 would be agreed to both by us and the United States. But we then come to a more serious difficulty; Avhat is to be the ratio for auxiliary craft as between France and Italy?28. France has always maintained that, while she reluctantly agreed at Washington to parity in capital ships with Italy, she can. on no account agree to parity in auxiliary surface craft and submarines. Italy has maintained with equal force and insistence that on no account will she enter into any agreement which gives her less than parity with France. With Italy it is largely a matter of prestige, since she has no present intention of building up to an equal naval strength with France, although it should be remembered that Italy is more dependent than France on sea-borne food and fuel. With France, considerations both of prestige and strategy enter into the question; she claims that she has always had a stronger navy than Italy, and sees no reason why she should now be bound to equality with Italy in cruiser strength; maintains that she has greater responsibilities than Italy in keeping open communications with her colonies, has to guard her Atlantic and channel ports; and, finally, that she has to keep watch on Germany. The strength of the German navy is limited to 8 battleships of 10,000 tons each, 8 light cruisers of 6,000 tons, 16 destroyers and 16 torpedo boats. But the Germans have evolved a new type of 10,000 battleship-cruiser, armed with 11-inch guns, which appears to have aroused considerable concern in French naval circles.29. It may here be remarked that these longer coast-lines have certain advantages over those of Italy, as they lie in the Atlantic as well as the enclosed Mediterranean. We do not agree with France&apos;s thesis of lines of communication joining her colonies to her. A far distant colony may be entirely unimportant to the nation, whereas a comparatively close-lying neutral country may supply vital necessities.30. It seems possible that a compromise may be reached under which France will place her requirements rather high, and Italy, while retaining the right to build up to France, will, in fact, be satisfied with a smaller number of auxiliary craft.31, Conversations have commenced between M. Briand and the Italian Ambassador at Paris with a view to the elimination of this difficulty.   M. Briand,
it is reported, is endeavouring to avoid questions of prestige and parity, and to have confined himself to informing the Ambassador of France&apos;s actual requirements in the matter of auxiliary craft.32. Meantime the idea of a &quot;Mediterranean Locarno &quot; has been mooted in the press, and appears to have been under serious consideration in Paris. The scheme is apparently not so much that Great Britain should guarantee France and Italy against attack as that all the Mediterranean Powers (including Great Britain) should enter into a treaty to come to each other&apos;s rescue against an aggressor State. Tt is apparently held that, if a political agreement of this character were to be concluded, the question of Franco-Italian &quot;parity&quot; in the Mediterranean could be more readily and amicably settled.33. The idea is one which is likely to make little appeal to this country  unless, of course, the Mediterranean Powers are content to guarantee each other against attack independently of any intervention by Great Britain. In Italy also the plan has been ill-received, and does not at present appear likely to materialise.Difficulty with France, and possibly with Italy, over the Division of Combatant Ships into Five Categories, and the Question of Transfer of Tonnage.34. France originally held out for what was termed &quot;global&quot; tonnage, i.e., that there should be no definite limitation of the tonnage which a State might allocate to the different categories of combatant ships, but that each Government should be at liberty to use its total allowance of tonnage as and how it thought fit. It will be seen from part III of this memorandum that the French Government have gradually receded from this position. Just recently we have learnt from a communication addressed by the United States Government to the French Ambassador at &quot;Washington that in the course of unofficial conversations between the French and American experts at Paris and Washington the final stage of the so-called &apos;&apos; modified French formula &quot; was as follows : &apos;35. Division of combatant ships into five categories, namely, capital ships, aircraft carriers, cruisers from 10,000 tons to 1,850 tons, destroyers from 1,850 tons to 600 tons, and submarines. We have unfortunately no evidence to show that the French Government intend to abide by the formula said to have been tentatively accepted by their officials, but, if they do, this particular difficulty will have been solved, since the above arrangement would be agreeable to ourselves, to the United States and probably also to Japan. Italy is unlikely to make difficulties about the category question if unsupported by France.36. There is, however, connected with this question of the division of combatant craft into categories, the question of the transfer of the percentage of tonnage from one category to clUO ther. At one time the French had pressed for unlimited authority for each State to transfer its tonnage from one category to another, but it now appears likely that France would be content with a percentage of transfer between categories. The difficulty, however, arises from the fact that, while the United States and ourselves could accept a transfer of not exceeding 10 per cent, between categories, France will probably ask for a higher percentage. We also do not wish to include battleships and aircraft carriers, which were dealt with separately under the Washington Treaty. Further, we hold that each State should declare definitely in treaty form the number of 8-inch-gun cruisers which it will have in existence in December 1936 and thereafter.French Refusal to A bolish the Submarine and Residtant Difficidty of Obtaining a Limitation of French, and possibly Japanese, Submarine Tonnage at a Figure Acceptable to Ourselves.37. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the United States Government are committed to propose to the Conference the abolition of the submarine. It is known, however, that the French Government are strongly opposed to such a step. While hitherto Italy has been strongly favourable to the retention of the submarine, she now holds that, on balance, Italian interests would best be served by its abolition, and it is understood that her delegation will be instructed accordingly. Japan will support France in her fight for the retention,. of the  submarine.    It  should  be  remembered  in  this  connexion
that even if it were possible, in face of so much opposition, to abolish the submarine, the effect on Japan could only be to lead to a more insistent demand than ever for a full 70 per cent, of 8-inch cruiser tonnage of the -strongest Power, thus rendering yet more difficult the settlement of our cruiser difficulty with the United States and Japan. It seems probable, therefore, that it will,, eventually be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the United States Government to agree to the retention of the submarine. As a matter of tactics, however, this concession should not be made until it is clear that Trance and Japan intend to adopt a reasonable attitude in regard to some of the other difficulties which will confront the Conference.38. Once it has been decided to retain the submarine, we shall immediately be faced with the serious problem presented by France&apos;s existing submarine tonnage of &quot;90,000 tons and her declared intention to build up to over 100,000 tons. If persisted in, this French programme will involve all round increases in destroyer and submarine tonnages, and the hopes of the Conference leading to any redtiction in the tonnages of auxiliary craft will prove illusory.The Japanese, also, are understood to contemplate a heavy submarine oonstruction programme; aiming at a total tonnage of 80,000 tons.The Form of Instrument which will emerge from the Naval Conference.39. If agreement is reached between the five Powers, the United States Govern-ment will undoubtedly press strongly for a form of five-Power treaty. From the American point of view and also from our point of view this is very important, because the decisions of the Conference are much more likely to pass successfully through the Senate if the treaty can be submitted to that body on emerging triumphantly from a Five-Power Conference, sponsored, if not actually convened, by the United States. If, however, it has to be announced in Washington that every-thing agreed upon in London must first be overhauled by the Preparatory Corn-mission and that the results of the London Conference cannot be expected to be reduced to treaty form until after the summoning of a General Disarmament Conference, there will be a great deal of discontent and criticism in the United States, and the difficulty of securing the assent of the Senate will be greatly enhanced. Moreover, from the point of view of our general relations with the United States, and of the threatened re-emergence of the belligerent rights question in particular, it is highly desirable that the naval question as between the United States and ourselves should be finally disposed of at the earliest possible moment. An indefinite prolongation at Geneva of the debates of the London Conference may have the effect of undoing much of the recent improvement in our relations with the United States.40. On the other hand, the French appear -to be quite determined not to sign a separate and final naval treaty, since they hold that land, air and naval disarmament should continue to be treated as a whole. They desire to make any concessions on the naval question dependent upon a satisfactory settlement from their point of view of problems connected with land armaments in general and the trained reserves in particular. They will be able to make a strong point in maintaining that when the Preparatory Commission adjourned it did so in order to permit of an understanding between the Powers principally concerned with the naval question, with the object of facilitating the resumption of the Commission^ deliberations. To sign a hard and fast treaty outside the Preparatory Commission and in anticipation of subsequent approval by the General Disarmament Conference would, they will maintain, be not only contrary to the understanding on which the Preparatory Commission adjourned, but derogatory to the influence and prestige of the League of Nations. It is probable, however, that France will not object to signing a Five-Power treaty limited to a revision of the Washington Treaty replacement figures; she may also be brought eventually to sign a Five-Power treaty relating to auxiliary craft, provided that ample provision is made for revision in the event of subsequent difficulties in\the Preparatory Commission.41. The alternative to the signature of a Five-Power treaty is the signature of a Three-Power treaty between the United States, Japan and ourselves, the treaty to contain a provision for the revision of its terms in the event of some fourth party embarking on a menacing programme of naval construction. But this course should only be followed as a last resort if agreement between the five Powers is, in  act, in sight, and all that divides them is the form which the instrument of agreement should
take. It is clear that the provisions of the Washington Treaty relating to the replacement of battleships can only be modified by the conclusion of an equally binding treaty between the original, signatories. A Five-Power naval treaty, to-which the minor European Naval Powers, such as Germany and Spain, might be invited to subscribe before the conference comes to an end, would definitely remove the Naval question from hazardous association with the land and air questions in the Preparatory Commission. On the other hand, the conclusion of a Three-Power treaty, desirable as this would be from the point of view of our relations with the United States, would produce an unfortunate impression of partial failure, would appear to mark a tendency to move away from the League, and would fling back the settlement of the naval question as between all other Powers into the maelstrom of the general disarmament discussions at Geneva.42. Every effort should, therefore, be made to bring the French to a more reasonable frame of mind on this question of the form of agreement.
PART III.HISTORICAL  SURVEY  OF  THE  NEGOTIATIONS  SINCE  THE  war FOR  THE  LIMITATION   OF  NAVAL  ARMAMENT.I. Washington Disarmament Conference, 1921-22.THE general movement for the pacific settlement of international disputes which followed the end of war, the formation of the League of Nations and the financial stringency experienced by the belligerent States all contributed to a desire to approach the problem of world disarmament.2. On the naval side of that problem, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, for example, declared in March 1920 that their policy was to maintain a &quot; One Power Standard,&quot; and a statement issued by Lord Lee of Fareham, the First Lord of the Admiralty, in March 1921 reasserted that policy and stated that it was hoped that it might be possible, as a result of frank and friendly discussion with the principal naval Powers, to avoid anything approaching competitive building either then or in the future. The same movement was seen in the United States. In December 1920 Senator Borah introduced into the Senate a resolution authorising the President to notify Great Britain and Japan of the readiness of the United States Government to take up the question of disarmament, whilst a second resolution by Senator Borah authorising the President to invite Great Britain and Japan to a conference for a naval holiday had passed both branches of the legislature by the end of June 1921. It was shortly after this that the United States President issued his invitations to a conference in Washington.3. The question of naval disarmament was affected, however, by the attitude of the United States towards the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the renewal of which was the subject of considerable discussion in the early part of 1921. There was a marked tension between the United States and Japan and it was made clear to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the renewal of the alliance or the establishment of any special relations between ourselves and Japanese would create an unfavourable impression not only in the mind of the American people but in that of the United States Government. Moreover, opinions in China and in at least one of the Dominions made it desirable to see whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could not, by some wider and even more satisfactory plan, ensure the peace in the Pacific and the development of the surrounding countries.4. It was in these circumstances that on the 10th July, 1921, the President of the United States issued to ourselves, France, Italy and Japan an invitation to take part in a conference to be held in Washington in November on the subject of limitation of armaments, in connexion with Avhich Pacific and Far Eastern problems would also be discussed. It was originally intended by His Majesty&apos;s Government that the disarmament discussion should be preceded by a conference in London concerning the Pacific, but the United States President came to the view that both questions were indispensable parts of the same whole and that both ought to be held concurrently at Washington.5. In outlining below the proceedings of the Washington Conference, particular attention is devoted to the question of the Japanese ratio, because the repetition at the present time of a Japanese claim to a 70 per cent, ratio is likely to form one of the main difficulties at the forthcoming conference in London.6. Before the conference met at Washington it appeared from information received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo that Japan, for financial and other reasons, would be Avilling to make reductions in her building programme provided that she were relieved of her apprehensions of possible United States aggression. The Japanese naval staff considered Guam, Manila and Hawaii as menaces to the safety of Japan, and if a guarantee could be obtained that the United States would not further develop the fortifications on their Pacific naval stations, the situation would be considerably relieved. This point became important during tire discussions s,t Washington.
7. At the first plenary session of the conference on the 12th November, 1921,. Mr. Hughes, the United States Secretary of State, made his proposal regarding the limitation of naval armaments. The proposal immediately concerned the British Empire, the United States and Japan, and contemplated that, after providing for the abandonment of capital ship building programmes and the scrapping of certain of the older ships, the replacement tonnage to be laid down after a period of ten. years should be on the following tonnage basis : United States ... ... ... ...      500,000Great Britain ... ... ... ...      500,000Japan ...... ... ...      300,000This constituted the 5:5:3 ratio and was based on the existing naval strength of those Powers.The tonnages proposed for auxiliary surface vessels and submarines were : Cruiseis and Destroyers.       Submarines.British Empire and U.S.A.      ... 450,000 90,000Japan ........ ... 270,000 54,000Lord Balfour, whilst accepting these ratios for vessels with the battlefleet,-pointed out that there might also be other vessels to be considered, such as cruisers; not connected with or required for fleet action.8. The secret of this proposal had been well kept by the United States Govern-ment and not a word had been allowed to leak out in regard to its character.Japanese Ratio Question.9. At the second plenary session, on the 15th November, 1921, Admiral Baron Kato, on behalf of Japan, accepted Mr. Hughes&apos;s proposal in principle, but indicated-that a few modifications would be proposed with regard to the tonnage basis for replacement of the various classes of vessels. He also stated that Japan had never claimed, nor had any intention of claiming, to have a naval establishment equal in strength to that of either the United States or the British Empire.10. The United States proposal was referred to a technical sub-committee, who were at an early stage confronted with a claim by the Japanese representatives that the existing strength of Japan in capital ships should be 70 per cent, and not 60 per cent, as proposed.11. In a conversation between Mr. (now Lord) Balfour, Lord Beatty and Mr. Hughes, the latter was of opinion that to yield to Japan&apos;s desire for an increased ratio would wreck the whole scheme, and that all efforts should be concentrated on. bringing Japan into line. They agreed, therefore, that, subject to the consent of Baron Kato, the question of the number of American, British and Japanese capital ships should be discussed forthwith between Mr. Hughes, Baron Kato and Lord Balfour.12. The Japanese claim for an increased ratio was discussed on the 19th November, 1921, by the heads of the three delegations. Mr. Hughes emphasised the fact that the United States plan was not based on any calculation of the respective requirements of the three countries but rather on the actual facts of their comparative strength, which seemed the only practicable method. On this basis Japan was, according to the United States experts, entitled to only 50 per cent, of the British Empire and United States strength, but 60 per cent, was chosen so as to give a generous margin. Lord Balfour stated that he was prepared, on practical grounds, to approach the matter from the point of view of Mr. Hughes, rather than argue about the relative needs of the three Powers, and he hoped that Japan would do the same. Baron Ka/to did not reject the principle of the American scheme, but desired to examine the figures with the experts.13. At the end of November the United States, British and Japanese naval experts reported that they had failed to reach agreement, the Japanese expert adhering to the 70 per cent, ratio. The question was, therefore, again referred to the heads of the three delegations.14. On the 1st December, 1921, Lord Balfour, after consultation with Mr. Hughes, first saw Baron Kato, who explained his difficulties very frankly. The reaction in Japan in the previous year in favour of reduction of armaments had
led Baron Kato to accept the United States proposals in principle. When the question was examined in detail, however, the Japanese Government and Parliament supported him in demanding 70 per cent, and his difficulty was how to justify to his people a concession apparently forced upon him by the United States Government.15. Lord Balfour pointed out what a disaster it would be to the world if the conference broke down over this difference and indicated that the United States, incensed against Japan, would outbid her, so that in five years&apos; time Japan&apos;s position would be incomparably worse off than under the 60 per cent, proposal, and, further, that Japan would lose the advantages of the highly promising negotiations in regard to the Pacific and China. Baron Kato conceded all this, but required more to justify his position. He would be able to satisfy Japanese opinion on the condition that the United States agreed to the status quo in regard to fortifications in the Pacific (Manila, Guam and Hawaii), Japan, in return, agreeing not to proceed with the fortifications in Formosa, Pescadores and Oshima. Provided that the offensive power of the United States against Japan was limited by the fact that the United States had no bases within striking distance, Baron Kato felt he might justify acceptance of a 60 per cent, ratio.16. Baron Kato developed his case on the above lines at a meeting with Mr. Hughes and Lord Balfour on the 3rd December, 1921, except that he added naval bases to his request for the statiis quo in regard to fortifications in the Pacific. Mr. Hughes gave the United States point of view. He made it clear that he could make no concessions as regards naval bases and fortifications except as part of a general settlement to be accepted by Japan, which must include, in addition, the proposed quadruple arrangement and naval scheme as a whole, based on the ten-ten-six proportion. Subject to this, Mr. Hughes indicated that the United States might agree to the maintenance of the status quo as regards fortifications and naval bases in the Pacific, and in particular not to increase the fortifications of Guam or Manila, or any island capable of use as a base for offensive purposes against Japan. But he expressly differentiated the case of Hawaii, which was too remote from Japan to be used for offensive purposes and possessed a purely defensive character.17. At the same meeting (the 3rd December, 1921), Lord Balfour stated that our delegation accepted and commended the ten-ten-six ratio on grounds of general policy, and that our technical advisers considered that, of the three countries concerned, Japan was the most secure under that arrangement when geographical and economic factors were taken into account. Lord Balfour emphasised, also, the reasonableness of Japan&apos;s proposal for a status qxio as regards fortifications in the Pacific, and pointed out that, with this safeguard and with the quadruple arrangement, the Japanese people could regard their future safety with equanimity.18. Baron Kato then communicated with his Government, and, on the 12th December, 1921, he announced, at a meeting with Mr. Hughes and Lord Balfour, that he was willing to accept the ten-ten-six ratio on the understanding that the United States would agree to the status quo as regards fortifications and naval bases in the Pacific. This was accepted on the understanding that Hawaii was excluded and that all the Powers members of the quadruple treaty, including Japan, accepted the status quo. Ports in Australia and New Zealand were excluded from the scheme, and Singapore, also, by the fixing of the eastern limit at the meridian of 110o East longitude.19. Some little difficulty was caused by the insistence of Japan on the retention of their newest ship, the &quot; Mutsu,&quot; but, in order to provide for this, a rearrangement of the maximum tonnage of capital ships, for the purpose of replacement, was arrived at without disturbing the relative strength on the basis of the agreed ratio.20. To sum up, it may be said that Japan was persuaded to agree to 60 per cent, of the British Empire and United States strength, instead of 70 per cent., in return for an assurance against the development of fortifications and naval bases in the Pacific at places which were considered to be within striking distance of Japan.Attitude of France and Italy.21. The agreement reached between the United States, the British Empire and Japan concerning capital ships was a provisional one, depending for its final and definite adoption  upon the  attitude of France and   Italy.    Accordingly,  a[20254] d
sub-committee of the conference proceeded to consider the question of capital ship tonnage with regard to France and Italy.22. Italy expressed the desire to maintain naval parity with France, and it was understood that France was content with parity with Italy. It was also recognised from the outset that these two countries could not fairly be asked to scrap their ships in the proportion in which the United States, the British Empire and Japan were to scrap their ships. In the case of the three latter Powers, the scrapping amounted to about 40 per cent, of the capital ship strength, and it was not thought, in view of the reduction of the navies of France and Italy, that those two Powers could be asked to. scrap in anything like that proportion, which would have meant, in the case of France, a reduction to about 102,000 tons. It was proposed, therefore, that France and Italy should retain the ships they then had, but that in replacing their old ships, they should keep their capital ships down to 175,000 tons. The French delegation at first pressed for freedom to build ten capital ships of 35,000 tons each. As it was clear that a programme of such a magnitude could only raise the greatest difficulties and could net form the basis of any agreement, the United States State Department addressed a strong appeal to M. Briand, pressing him to abandon the attitude adopted by the French delegation, under Admiral de Bon, at Washington. As a result of this appeal the French Government agreed to accept the limit of 175,000 tens for capital ships, that is to say, attacking ships, but reserved their decision so far as concerned what they termed defensive ships, that is to say, auxiliary vessels and submarines.23. Pending the receipt by the French delegation of instructions respecting the French requirements in auxiliary vessels, a general discussion ensued as regards the action to be taken by the Conference in respect of submarines. Our delegation put forward a very powerful plea for the total abolition of the submarine, but as France, Italy and Japan manifested an inability to agree, the adoption of the British proposal could not be proceeded with. As a compromise, however, Mr. Hughes, on behalf of the United States, suggested that the British Empire and the United States should each reduce the maximum limit of their submarine tonnage to 60,000 tons, and that France, Japan and Italy should each retain the tonnage they had (31,391, 31,452, 21,000 tons respectively). Our delegation were prepared to accept this proposal. Italy was prepared to accept 31,500 tons as a maximum, provided she were put on a parity with France, whilst Japan asked for 54,000 tens. All prospect of agreement, however, was destroyed by the attitude of France. On the 28th December, 1921, the French delegation were instructed by their Government that it was impossible to accept a limitation below that of 330,000 tens for auxiliary craft and 90,000 tons for submarines without imperilling the vital interests of France.24. Agreement on the limitation of submarines and light craft, including cruisers, being evidently impossible, in view of the French attitude, attention was then directed to the limitation of the size of auxiliary vessels, which Lord Lee of Fareham stated was really a corollary of the agreement to limit capital ships. An agreement was reached on this point and also as regards aircraft carriers.25. Finally, the &quot; Root &quot; resolutions, imposing certain limitations upon the use of armaments, were adopted with regard to the conduct of submarines in war and the use of poison gas, and were embodied in a treaty presented to the conference.Main Provisions of the Washington Treaty.26. A brief summary follows, giving the main provisions of the Naval Disarmament Treaty, the treaty embodying the &quot;Root&quot; resolutions and the Quadruple Pacific Treaty.27. The Naval Disarmament Treaty between the United States, British Empire, France, Italy and Japan, was signed on the 6th February, 1922. It is divided into Chapters I and II, the latter dealing with the rules for the execution of the treaty. Chapter I provides for the retention of capital ships, as specified in Chapter II; for the abandonment of capital ship building programmes; for a maximum capital ship replacement tonnage of 525,000 for the United States and the British Empire, 315,000 for Japan and 175,000 for France and Italy; for a
limitation of the size of the ships (35,000 tons); and for a limitation of their armament (guns not to exceed a calibre of 16 inches). No vessel of war other than a capital ship shall carry a gun with a calibre in excess of 8 inches. Aircraft carriers are also dealt with, provision being made for limitation of total tonnage, for an arrangement as to replacement and for a limitation of size and armament. Article 19 of the.treaty provides for the maintenance of the status quo in the Pacific Ocean, with regard to fortifications and naval bases.28. The same five Powers also signed a treaty which supplemented the Naval Armaments Treaty by imposing certain limitations on the use of armaments. It provided for the protection of the lives of neutrals and non-combatants at sea in time of war and for the prevention of the use in war of noxious gases and chemicals. This treaty never came into force, owing to France&apos;s refusal to ratify the clauses referring to the conduct of submarine warfare.29. The Quadruple Pacific Treaty between the United States, British Empire, France and Japan was signed on the 13th December, 1921, and ratifications were deposited on the 17th August, 1923. The treaty provided that, on the deposit of ratifications, the Anglo-Japanese alliance was to terminate. By the treaty, also, the contracting parties agree to respect their rights in relation to their insular possessions in the region of the Pacific Ocean; any controversies arising out of any Pacific question, not satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, to be submitted for con-sideration by a joint conference; the contracting parties to communicate with one another in the event of aggressive action by any other Power threatening the said rights; the treaty to be in force for ten years, to continue, thereafter, subject to twelve months&apos; notice by a contracting party.II. Steps taken by the League of Nations and by the Preparatory Commission on Disarmament constituted by the League Council.&quot;&quot; Article 8 of the Covenant of the League provides that &quot;the members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety&quot;; the Council was; instructed to formulate plans for such reduction, taking account of the geographical situation and circumstances of &quot;each State. In order to create the sense of security without which it would be impossible to give effect to this provision, a number of schemes of mutual assistance was propounded, including, finally, the Geneva Protocol of 1924, which was rejected at the Assembly of 1925. Following on this failure the Assembly asked the Council to constitute a Preparatory Commission with mandate to prepare the way for an ultimate General Disarmament Conference. This commission was duly formed, and consisted of representatives1 from League States, as well as from the United States and Russia. The first and second sessions of this commission, which were held in May and September 1926 respectively, were mainly devoted to the discussion of the work of various sub-committees appointed to report on technical questions. At the third session, in March 1927, the United Kingdom and French Governments each submitted a draft general disarmament convention. Both drafts dealt only with general principles, leaving actual figures to be filled in later by the Disarmament Conference. It was at once apparent that there was a wide divergence of principle between the two drafts on both the naval and military sides.French Draft Convention.On the naval side the French draft provided for limitation by total tonnage, viz., the aggregate of the individual tonnage of vessels of all classes employed (1) for home defence, (2) for the defence of overseas territory. Those divisions were further sub-divided into (a) tonnage essential for the purposes of security and the defence of national interests, and (b) tonnage to be completed before the expiry of the treaty. The only other restrictions were a maximum tonnage and a maximum calibre of gun for any individual vessel.As regards land forces, the French draft provided that the effectives to be limited &quot;shall be understood to mean effectives with the colours or in formations organised on a military basis which may be immediately employed without being mobilised.&quot; In other words, trained reservists would not be inducted for the purpose of reckoning the total strength of armies to be subjected to reduction.[20254]. d 2
United Kingdom Draft Convention.The United Kingdom draft provided that &quot; as to each of the classes of ships mentioned in Table II of Annex I, the tonnage of any one ship, the number and tonnage of all the ships in that class and the calibre of the guns mounted in such ship must not exceed the figures there set down.&quot;Table II showed the following categories : 1. Battleships and battle cruisers. 2. Coast defence battleships. 3. Cruisers. 4. Aircraft carriers.5. Destroyers (includes flotilla leaders).  Torpedo-boat destroyers.  Leaders. 6. Torpedo boats (includes coastal motor-boats). 7. Submarines, large and small. 8. Sloops, minesweepers, &amp;c. 9. River gunboats.(N.B- It should be noted that at that time there was no question of the division of the cruiser category into two classes.)As regards land forces the draft provided that &quot; the limitation of land armaments shall be effected by limiting the number of effectives, meaning thereby troops which could within .... of the outbreak of hostilities be available for despatch to the fighting line.&quot; This wording was intended to include reservists for the purpose of reckoning the strength of armies.Attitude of Other Governments.In regard to the limitation of land forces, our thesis received general support from the United States, Germany and one or two smaller countries. The continental conscriptionist countries, however, supported the French thesis so strongly that it was at once evident that if Great Britain rigidly maintained her attitude it would be impossible to reach agreement. Even at that early date Lord Cecil, in the Preparatory Commission, said: &apos;&apos; We still believe that some account ought to be taken of the trained reserves, or at any rate some portion of the trained reserves of different countries. We have felt, and I have stated it all along, that that is a matter which, however strongly we may feel about it as a matter of principle, does affect other countries very much more than ourselves, and that, if a limit can be arrived at which would not include any limitation of trained reserves amongst the other countries, then I do not think it would be at all likely that my Government would insist on its view with respect to that.&quot;On the question of naval armaments the position was more or less reversed. Our thesis was supported by the United States, Japan, the Argentine and Chile, whilst the only countries to support France were Italy and such insignificant naval Powers as Serbia, Roumania, Holland and Sweden.French Compromise Proposal.In an attempt to bridge the wide divergence between our thesis and that of the French, the French delegation subsequently put forward a compromise proposal, under which a third column was added. This third column provided for the sub-division under four classes of vessel of the total tonnage to be completed before the expiry of the treaty, with power to transfer tonnage between one category and another, subject to a year&apos;s notice to the secretariat of the League of Nations. The proposal is illustrated by the following table : 
Total Tonnage of Warships.1.	II.		nr.		Tonnage essential for the purposes of Security and the Defence of National Interests.	Tonnage to be completed before the expiry of the Convention.	Division  into  Total Tonnage   by   Groups of the Total Tonnage stated in Column II.										Total Tonnage of 							)00 tons.			Capital Ships.	Aircraft Carriers.	Vessels under 10,(	Submarines.		a.	b.	c.	d.					The above compromise amounted to very little for, while it recognised a sub-division into groups or categories, it provided for unlimited tonnage transfer between those categories.III. Geneva Naval Conference, June-August, 1927.In the meantime, the United States Government had issued the invitations to the Geneva Naval Conference, and Lord Cecil announced in the Preparatory Commission that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom felt it to be absolutely vital to agree to nothing which might interfere in any way with the results to be hoped for from that conference. He, however, made it plain.that the French compromise proposal was inacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government on the ground that it would fail to put an end to competitive building in that it imposed no maximum unit tonnage or armament for those categories of vessel not covered by the Washington Treaty, and allowed too much latitude as a result of the faculty of. transfer of tonnage from one class to another.The discussions throughout the conference were overshadowed by the vexed question of parity. When at the outset our proposals were criticised in the American press as an attempt on our part to perpetuate our mastery of the seas and to put America into a position of permanent inferiority, official pronouncements were made to the effect that we had no intention or wish to negotiate on any basis other than that of complete parity. This assurance was, however, somewhat modified by subsequent pronouncements in this country pointing out that strict numerical parity would mean inferiority for us in the light of our more extensive responsibilities.The Americans put forward proposals involving the division of those types of vessels not covered by the Washington Treaty into three categories : (1) cruisers (as to which Washington had done no more than fix a maximum unit tonnage and armament); (2) destroyers; and (3) submarines, with a specified total tonnage limitTable X.
in each category to be used by each Power in the manner which it might consider most consistent with its needs..    The tonnages proposed .were,:- ___________ ________________________.....Cruisers.     Destroyers.

Reduction of capital ships and aircraft carriers was also proposed. The reason for the introduction of a second and smaller class of cruiser was the desire to reduce the burden of cost by building as many of the cruisers as possible in the smaller class. It was hoped eventually to-eliminate the larger class. Later there was a further reason for having a smaller class, as it was only by this means that we could obtain the numbers we required on a tonnage low enough to be acceptable to the U.S.A. The Japanese proposals consisted, virtually, of a scheme for a naval holiday.It is unnecessary to trace all the various stages of the Geneva Conference, and it will suffice to give here in full the final proposal made by our delegation. On the 14th July the United States delegate had said that, if the British and Japanese could agree, he felt sure that it would be possible for the American delegation to make agreement complete. Our delegation accordingly consulted with their Japanese colleagues and on the 28th July made the following proposals to the Conference : Final British Proposals.&quot;1. The combined total tonnage of cruisers, destroyers and submarines, below the age limit for replacement, is not to exceed 1&quot; (a.) For British Empire and United States of America 590,000 &quot;(b.) For Japan  ... ... ... ... ...     385,000&quot;2. In addition, each Power may retain 25 per cent, of the total tonnages givenin paragraph 1 (a) and (b) in vessels over age. &quot;3. Age limits before Avhich replacement cannot take place: 10,000-ton cruisers        ... ... ... ...     18 years.Other cruisers &apos; Destroyers Submarines16 16 134. The following vessels over 6,000 tons to be retained in their respective fleets : &quot;British Empire: 4 &apos; Hawkins,&apos; /York,&apos; and 2 &apos; Emeralds.&apos; &quot;United States of America: 10 &apos;Omahas.* &apos;&apos; Japan : 4 &apos; Furutakas.&apos;5. All other cruisers to be divided into two classes : &quot; (a.) 10,000-ton cruisers.&quot; (&amp;.) Smaller cruisers of a maximum displacement of 6,000 tons and mounting a gun not exceeding 6 inches in calibre.1 6. 10,000-ton cruisers to be limited in number : &quot;For British Empire and United States of America    ... ...     12&quot;For Japan ..; ... ... ... ... ...      8&apos;7. Maximum standard displacement for flotilla leaders to be 1,850 tons and for destroyers 1,500 tons. Flotilla leaders and destroyers not to carry a gun above 5 inches calibre.1 8. Of the total tonnage in the destroyer class, 100 per cent, may be used for vessels of 1,500 tons and under, but not more than 16 per cent, of the totalmay be used for the flotilla-leader class, i.e., vessels above 1,500 tons andIV  uclimited to a maximum of 1,850 tons.
*&apos; 9. Submarines to be divided into two classes : &quot; Class A       ... ... ... ...     1,800 down to 1,000&quot;Class B       ... ... ... ...     Maximum 600*&quot; Submarines not to carry a gun in excess of 5 inches calibre. V 10. The maximum tonnage to be devoted to submarines of either class, of whatever age, to be as follows : &quot;(a.) British Empire and United States of America ... 90,000 &quot;(&amp;.) Japan ... ... .... ... ...     60,000of which total tonnage not more than two-thirds may be used for Class A submarines:&quot;11. Except for the restrictions imposed in paragraphs 6, 8 and 10, the total tonnage allocated to be used as each Power thinks best.&quot;On production of the above proposals the United States delegate enquired whether we were adamant in our view with respect to the abolition of the 8-inch gun for new construction other than the 10,000-ton cruisers and certain specified vessels. On being told that this was so, he stated that he would communicate with his Government, but that he could hold out no hope of agreement unless we could meet the United States Governments view that there should be full liberty in the design and armament of any smaller class of cruiser agreed to. Subsequently, he communicated the decision of his Government that, in view of the limitation of the 8-inch gun, they were unable to regard our proposal as offering any basis of agreement.It will thus be seen that the Conference had failed on account of disagreement on the cruiser question in general, and, in particular, as a result of the American refusal to accept any separate limitation of their 8-inch cruiser tonnage. The United States desired to put the whole of their tonnage quota into 8-inch cruisers, while we aimed at a strict limitation of that class in order to have sufficient tonnage left over to meet oar requirements in numbers. In the final stages His Majesty&apos;s Government refused to agree to any solution which did not impose a strict limitation on the 8-inch gun, because freedom to utilise the whole tonnage for 8-inch cruisers would prevent us from building the smaller class. The United States Government, who declined to accept any such limitation, refused, in turn, to agree to the total tonnage figure of 737,500 tons for cruisers, destroyers and submarines included in the British proposals put forward towards the end of the Conference. In these proposals the amount allowed for cruisers was 454,750 tons for 70 cruisers, and it was contemplated that the difference between this amount and the 468,000 tons required for the 12 10,000-ton 8-inch, and 58 6,000-ton 6-inch, cruisers would be made up by reductions in destroyer or submarine tonnage. That figure was the lowTest which could have permitted of the number of cruisers which we considered necessary. The Japanese, in all probability, would have agreed in the end to anything on which we and the Americans could have agreed.Agreement was provisionally reached on destroyers, submarines and exempt class, but the United States of America refused even to discuss capital ship and aircraft carrier reduction unless agreement was reached on all other points.IY. Aftermath of Geneva.In the following September the Assembly was faced with a deadlock consequent on the irreconcilable divergences in the Preparatory Commission and the break-down of the Geneva Conference. In order to avoid acknowledgment of failure, a sub-committee, called the Security Committee, was set up, the real, though unavowed, purpose of which was to put off the evil day. This Security Committee (which was practically identical with the Preparatory Commission) met in December 1927, and again in March 1928, and adopted a series of resolutions and model treaties which, whether useful or not, did nothing to assist the Preparatory Commission towards agreement on disarmament.Meanwhile every effort was being made in this country to find a solution of the naval question. In November 1927 Admiral Kelly had an interview with the Chief of the General Staff of the French navy, but found that the French Government were not disposed to make any material advance from their 1927 compromise proposal.
In February 1928 the Admiralty put forward, for consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Policy, three alternative schemes, of which one for limitation by the following categories was considered to be the most promising : 1. Capital ships. 2. Aircraft carriers.3. Cruisers between 10,000 and 7,000 tons.4. Surface vessels under 7,000 tons.5. Submarines, in two classes, if this could be arranged.6. Small vessels exempt from limitation.States would be allowed to transfer tonnage from a higher into a lower category in all classes, excluding 1 and 2, subject to a limit to the proportion of total tonnage which might be utilised for submarines.States with a total tonnage, including class 6, not exceeding 80,000 tons to be subject to no classification.A nglo-French Conversations.On the 9th March Sir Austen Chamberlain discussed the disarmament situation with M. Briand and told him of the latest Admiralty proposals, of which, at his request, he subsequently furnished him with a copy. M. Briand said that he would put them before the French naval authorities and would use all his influence to secure their acceptance. If, however, he was to be successful he would need our co-opera-tion. He had often told the French Admiralty that a naval war with Britain was out of the question, and he was quite prepared to meet the criticism he had encountered for agreeing at Washington to a very small battleship allotment. The real naval crux for France was Italy. At the Geneva Conference we had disagreed with the Americans over the basis of estimating cruiser requirements, and France was in much the same position vis-a-vis of Italy as was the British Empire in regard to America. In each case our oversea responsibilities and our sea communi-cations were much greater. It would be to our mutual advantage when the proper time came generally to press that those factors should form the basis of assessment of the cruiser strength which States could justifiably claim.Admiral Kelly&apos;s Conversations with Admiral Long.On the 13th and 14th March, Admiral Kelly had conversations with the American Admiral Long at Geneva. From the first of these it appeared that, if the United States Government would agree to the division of cruisers into two classes, they would put the maximum tonnage of the smaller class as high as 8,300 tons. Presumably this was to allow for the mounting of 8-inch guns. They would not agree to the division of submarines into two classes. From the second conversation it was clear that there had been Franco-American discussions in Paris, and that the Americans would be prepared to accept the French compromise proposal of April 1927 with the following modifications.   Classification to be : 1. Capital ships. 2. Aircraft carriers.3. Surface vessels between 10,000 and 3,000 tons. 4. Surface vessels below 3,000 tons. 5. Submarines.No tonnage to be transferred from categories 1 and 2 to other categories. Transfer between other categories to be permitted only to a limitedpercentage, say, 10 per cent. An exempt class to be provided for.The French decision in regard to these proposals was not then known, but on the 15th March the French admiral, who had just returned from Paris, told Admiral Kelly that, though the British Admiralty&apos;s proposal had not yet been completely studied, it was unlikely to be considered acceptable. The French admiral thought that there was little separating the French from the Americans, and that an agree-ment with the latter was quite possible. It seemed that the French might be prepared to extend the period of notice of transfer of tonnage from one year to eighteen months.Later the French Naval Representative, in a conversation at Geneva on the 27th June, stated that there had been no mention of a category for surface vessels of 3,000 tons and below in the conversations between the French and Admiral Long.
Adjournment of Sittings of Preparatory Commission.On the 15th March the Preparatory Commission met, and on the 24th March decided to adjourn on the ground that the private conversations which were proceeding and which were alluded to by various speakers might lead to some arrangement if time were allowed.Y. Anglo-French Compromise.Further Conversations with the French.At the beginning of June M. Briand, in conversation with Sir Austen Chamberlain at Geneva, referred to their discussion in March. The French Council of Ministers, he said, had been studying the question, and were unanimously of opinion that it was essential to reach agreement with this country. The basis which they proposed was agreement on a formula, similar to that which he had mooted to Sir Austen in March, for determining relative cruiser strength according to length of lines of communication. This plan did not commend itself to the Admiralty, who considered that length was only one of several factors, amongst which were the volume and the vital nature of the trade on these communications and their geographical relation to potential dangers. In a conversation with M. Paul Boncour a few days later, Sir Austen, after voicing his apprehensions that a continuance of the deadlock would lead Germany sooner or later to repudiate the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, reverted to the Admiralty proposals as handed to M. Briand in March. M. Paul Boncour had nothing definite to suggest and no instructions of any kind.   The conversation was accordingly not pursued.In the meantime Admiral Kelly, who had been in more or less constant touch. with the French Naval Staff, had a conversation with the French naval representative at Geneva on the 5th June, in which Admiral Violette, after expressing his own view that any attempt to find a line of communication formula could only lead to an impasse, put forward what he described as a purely personal idea which had recently occurred to him. It was to the following effect: It being impossible to limit vessels armed with guns of 6-inch calibre and less, owing to the faculty of arming merchantmen with guns up to that calibre, why not abandon the attempt to do so and be content with carrying the Washington Agreement one stage further by limiting only vessels of 10,000 tons or less mounting a gun in excess of 6-inch. In such vessels the British Empire could accept parity with the United States and France with Italy. Submarines would be limited in a separate category. The Admiralty were of the opinion that such a method, though falling short of the complete limitation desired, would constitute a valuable further step forward from the limitations already existing under the Washington Treaty. It was further considered that the freedom to build the 6-inch type cruiser of a size up to 10,000 tons would make the proposal more acceptable to the United States Government than our Coolidge Conference proposal for limitation to a smaller tonnage.On the 22nd June the Cabinet met to consider Admiral Violette&apos;s suggestion. They decided that the French Government should be informed that the scheme commended itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that if the French Government were willing to adopt it, we would not persist in our opposition to the French standpoint on trained reserves.Exchange of Notes with the French Government.On the 28th June His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris acted on his instructions to address a note to the French Government in the sense of the Cabinet decision.In a note of the 20th July the French Government replied to the effect that they regretted that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been unable to accept the compromise put forward in the Preparatory Commission by the French delegation in March 1927, but that for the sake of agreement they were prepared to agree to the plan proposed by Admiral Violette and accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. They proceeded to define more precisely than had previously been done the method by which they[20254] E
Correspondence ivith the United States, Italian and Japanese Governments.On the 30th July instructions were sent by telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s repre-sentatives in Washington, Rome and Tokyo, to communicate the terms of the compromise with the French to the Governments to which they are accredited, to explain that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government had agreed to a substantial modification of the positions which they held respectively at the meeting of the Preparatory Commission in March 1927, and had worked out these proposals which they were themselves now ready to accept, and which they hoped would serve to promote general agreement.   The agreement was set out as follows : &quot; Limitations which the Disarmament Conference will have to determine will deal with four classes of warships : &quot; (1.) Capital ships, i.e., ships of over 10,000 tons or with guns of morethan 8-inch calibre; &quot; (2.) Aircraft carriers of over 10,000 tons;&quot; (3.) Surface vessels of or below 10,000 tons; armed with guns of morethan 6-inch and up to 8-inch calibre; &quot; (4.) Ocean-going submarines, i.e., over 600 tons.&quot;Washington Treaty regulates limitations in classes (1) and (2) and the Disarmament Conference will only have to consider method of extending these limitations to Powers non-signatory to this treaty.&quot;As regards classes (3) and (4) the final Disarmament Conference will fix a maximum tonnage applicable to all Powers which no Power would be allowed to exceed for the total of vessels in each of these respective categories during the period covered by the convention. Within this maximum limit each Power will indicate at final conference for each of these categories the tonnage they propose to reach and which they undertake not to exceed during the period covered by the convention.&quot;The essence of the agreement almost immediately leaked out in Paris and was seized upon by the big navy party in the United States as a heaven-sent gift at a moment when the passage of the Naval Construction Bill was by no means definitely assured. There followed a violent campaign in the American press against what was held to be an ill-concealed attempt to trick the United States. The task of its authors was greatly facilitated by the absence of any authoritative statement regarding the exact terms and scope of the agreement. Stories of secret bargains of all kinds, made between ourselves and the French at the expense of others were put about and gained widespread credence. The State Department themselves were not free from these suspicions, and after receiving the explanations which they had asked for on the strictly technical side, the origin, scope and general implications of the arrangement were carefully explained to them. At an early stage they were informed of the undertaking given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to withdraw their opposition to the French thesis in the matter of trained reserves, and were subse-quently furnished with the text of the notes exchanged by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government. Lord Cushendun, during his attendance at the Assembly in Geneva, also gave out a statement for public consumption in terms similar to the explanations given to the United States Government through His Majesty&apos;s representative in Washington.These steps were not wholly successful in dissipating suspicion either abroad or at home, and matters were not improved by recurrent partial leakages in Paris.suggested the arrangement might be applied. They took note of our under-taking not to oppose the French standpoint in regard to land armaments, and concluded by expressing the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government would confirm their acceptance of the compromise, and that concerted action by the two Govern-ments would enable the support of the other naval Powers to be obtained.On the 24th July the Cabinet Committee on Policy recommended that we should confirm our acceptance of the compromise as set forth in the French note, and concert with the French Government in submitting it to the United States, Japanese and Italian Governments. A note in that sense was addressed to the French Government by Lord Crewe on the 28th July.
Replies of the Three Governments.The reply of the United States was received at the Foreign Office on the 28th September. It was moderate in tone but firm in its expression of the refusal of the United States Government to accept a plan which, it pointed out, would limit the only class of vessel suited to American needs while imposing no restriction on the type most suited to the requirements of others.The Japanese Government, in their reply, expressed their general concurrence in the agreement. They pointed out that it must be carefully and justly drawn up in order to be equitable as between countries whose circumstances are dissimilar.The Italian reply, after insisting on the Italian view that military, naval and air disarmament should all be discussed together and not in separate compartments and on their formula for the global limitation of tonnage, rejected the Anglo-French Compromise but made certain counter-proposals. The British naval attache at Rome had learnt that the Italian Government was on the point of accepting our proposals as a basis, when the United States refusal was published. They therefore restated their old views, as there appeared to be no object in weakening their position by acceptance.VI. The Sixth Meeting of the Preparatory Commission, April-May, 1929.After the failure of the Anglo-French compromise the question of re-opening negotiations with the United States Government was considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government. But there were many difficulties in the way : the American presidential election was to take place in November; Congress was to meet in December, and at any time thereafter the Senate might commence its debates on the Naval Construction Bill which had already been passed by the House; any naval discussions immediately before or during the debates upon the cruiser question in the United States Congress might be interpreted as an attempt to interfere with the passage of this legislation; a new American Administration was due to come into office in March, Mr. Coolidge having definitely declared his intention to resign; on the 11th November Mr. Coolidge delivered his famous Armistice Day speech which offered little encouragement to the opening of negotiations during his concluding term of office. Ever since the failure of the 1927 Conference Mr. Coolidge had displayed considerable bitterness over the naval question and was evidently in no mood to resume negotiations in a conciliatory spirit. It was accordingly decided by the Cabinet at the end of 1928 that no initiative should be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government until the new President assumed office and our own general election had taken place.On the 15th April, 1929, a further meeting of the Preparatory Commission took place at Geneva. So far as naval disarmament was concerned, the objective of the United Kingdom delegation was to prevent if possible any public discussions from taking place which might revive old controversies before there had been time for con-fidential discussions between ourselves and the American Government with a view to discovering a basis of agreement between the two principal naval Powers. The United Kingdom delegation remained in close touch with the American delegation throughout the proceedings of the conference and found ready co-operation from their American colleagues in pursuing this policy. On the 22nd April Mr. Gibson, the American delegate, made a general declaration explaining the American attitude on the naval question which scrupulously avoided touching on former controversies. The most important part of Mr. Gibson&apos;s speech is contained in the three following paragraphs: &quot;During the third session of the Preparatory Commission, the French delegation brought forward a method which was an attempt to combine its original total tonnage proposals with the method of tonnage by categories. Under this method, a total tonnage was assigned to each nation and this total divided among categories of ships by specified tonnages. If I am not mistaken, certain modifications were suggested in informal discussions so as to provide that the tonnage allocated to any given category might be increased by a certain percentage to be agreed upon, such increase to be transferred from any other category or categories not already fixed by existing treaty.&quot; In the hope of facilitating general agreement as to naval armaments, my Government is disposed to accept the French proposal as a basis of discussion It is, of course, the understanding of my Government that this involves an[20254] e 2
agreement upon the method alone and not upon any quantitative tonnages or the actual percentages to be transferred from one category to another. All quantitative proposals of any kind should properly be reserved for discussion by a final conference.&quot; My Government is disposed to give full and friendly consideration to any supplementary methods of limitation which may be calculated to make our proposals, the French thesis, or any other, acceptable to other Powers, and if such a course appears desirable, my Government will be prepared to give consideration to a method of estimating equivalent naval values which takes account of other factors than displacement tonnage alone. In order to arrive at a basis of comparison in the case of categories in which there are marked variation as to unit characteristics, it might be desirable in arriving at a formula for estimating equivalent tonnage to consider certain factors which produce these variations, such as age, unit displacement, and calibre of guns. My Government has given careful consideration to various methods of comparison and the American Delegation will be in a position to discuss the subject whenever it comes before the Commission.&quot;The French proposal to which Mr. Gibson referred has been described in paragraph above. It had been rejected by both the United Kingdom and the American delegations at the time it was first made in April 1927. That the United States Government were prepared to reconsider their rejection of this proposal we knew from their note of the 28th September, respecting the Anglo-French Compromise, but up to the time of Mr. Gibson&apos;s speech His Majesty&apos;s Government had not seen their way to modify their attitude in regard to it.Attention was, however, focussed upon the new American proposal for estimating equivalent naval values, which was generally regarded as constituting a most valuable contribution to the cause of naval disarmament. Lord Cushendun, who rose immediately Mr. Gibson sat down, was able to give the policy outlined in the speech a warm welcome, while reserving any comment on points of detail until he had been able to consult his Government.The commission finally adjourned without entering upon any detailed discussion either of the naval problem as a whole, i.e., limitation of personnel, material and expenditure, or of the new American proposals concerning material, thus leaving the field clear for preliminary negotiations between the principal naval Powers. The commission instructed its president to fix the date of its next meeting, and asked the Naval Powers concerned to inform him of the progress of their negotiations, so as to facilitate his task and enable him to convene the commission with a full knowledge of the facts.Considerable suspicion was noticeable amongst members of the French, Japanese and Italian delegations that any negotiations between the United States and ourselves might result in a fait accompli, which the other Powers would be bound to accept or reject; but, so far as it was possible to judge, both the United Kingdom and American delegations were successful in assuring their colleagues that nothing of this kind was in contemplation. It was impressed on the other delegations that, while conversations of some sort between the United States and ourselves would clearly be an essential element in the future negotiations, the other naval Powers need have no fear of a &quot; take it or leave it &quot; attitude being adopted by either.During the meetings of the commission private conversations took place between the United Kingdom and American delegations, from which it was clear that Mr. Hoover desired to take full account of the British need for a larger number of small cruisers and that his new proposals for estimating equivalent naval values had been made for this express purpose. Mr. Gibson gave it as his private opinion that the Presidents new &quot;yardstick,&quot; when it was produced, would be found to allow the British Empire a preponderance of &quot; from fifteen to thirty 6-inch-gun cruisers &quot; in return for an American preponderance of one or two 8-inch-gun cruisers. Mr. Hoover was, Mr. Gibson said, most anxious to work closely with us, and felt the conclusion of a naval agreement was the first prerequisite of such co-operation.This was the first occasion on which the United States Government had shown any sign of compromise on strict mathematical parity, though certain of the United States newspapers had begun to recognise that such a parity would not be true parity in strength. On this new basis it was felt that an agreement might be reached, more especially if Mr. Gibson&apos;s views truly represented the United States Governments ideas as to relative numbers, as this would enable us to obtain our numbers without entailing large United States construction.
YII. Informal Negotiations between the Prime Minister and General Dawes,June-October, 1929.General Dawes landed at Southampton on the 14th June, presented his credentials to His Majesty the King on the following day, and left London the same evening for Scotland. On the 16th June there took place at Lossiemouth the newly-appointed Ambassador^ first meeting with the Prime Minister, and it was a happy augury for subsequent events that his Excellency succeeded in establishing the most friendly personal relations with Mr. MacDonald.At this first interview the foundations were laid for the entirely frank and informal negotiations which were only completed just prior to the Prime Ministers departure for the United States and Canada on the 28th September. General Dawes at once fell in with the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion that, in view of the prime importance of a naval agreement, not only for the British Empire and the United States but for the whole world, this question should be dealt with first and foremost, all other matters outstanding between the two countries being left in abeyance for the1 moment, including the difficult problem of1 belligerent rights, which it was agreed should not enter into the discussions. General Dawes also made it clear that what the President had in mind as the ultimate objective was an international naval con-ference in which the five Powers primarily concerned would participate in the hope of arriving at a settlement of the naval question mutually satisfactory to all parties. At the same time it was fully appreciated at a very early stage that the attitude of France and Italy might well prejudice the possibility of a five-Power agreement, in which event it was tentatively suggested that the United States, Japan and ourselves should fall back upon a tripartite understanding.Space is not available in which adequately to summarise the course of the negotiations that followed between Mr. MacDonald and General Dawes during the months of July, August and September. It will suffice to say that many obstacles had to be surmounted and more than one difficult corner turned before the way was cleared for the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Washington which turned out so successfully. By frankness and goodwill on both sides, as well as by the mutual exercise of patience, however, the abyss, which earlier in the year had appeared to yawn between the United States and ourselves, had been narrowed down to 30,000 tons a relatively small figure when it is remembered that the total tonnage of each of the two navies exceeds 1 million tons. It was agreed that this small remaining difference should be left over for settlement at the London Naval Conference.One of the most difficult features of these negotiations was the attitude which the Americans adopted on the &quot;yardstick&quot; proposal. At Geneva the American delegation had held out hopes, privately and unofficially, of a &quot;yardstick,&quot; which would, in return for a preponderance of one or two 8-inch-gun cruisers, give the British navy preponderance of &quot; from fifteen to thirty &quot; 6-inch-gun cruisers. Early in the conversations with General Dawes, however, it became clear that the United States Government had shifted their ground, and that the new &quot;yardstick&quot; would not give that elasticity to the negotiations which had been anticipated. This is one of the reasons why the negotiations proved so difficult, and results could only be achieved after prolonged interchange of views lasting from June to October. The results of these negotiations in terms of ships and gun calibres are given in Part II (p. 7) of this memorandum, and need not be repeated here. It should, however, be mentioned that the United States Government have made two concessions to us of real importance -concessions which we know were only made after a severe struggle with their own Navy Department :  1. They agreed, to the principle of equivalent tonnage (i.e., the &quot; yardstick &quot;), which was a complete reversal of their attitude at Geneva in 1927. It is true that Mr. Hoover&apos;s first intentions, as expressed to our delegates orally at Geneva, did not materialise. It has since been ascertained that this was due to a serious protest by the Navy Board, leading to a revision of the original &quot;yardstick&quot; proposals. But even as thoy stand at presentthey represent a &quot; yardstick &quot; ratio of 1 ton of 8-inch tonnage as the equivalent of 1 - 38 tons of 6-inch tonnage, and there is reason to i hope that we can improve on this. The principle of the &quot; yardstick &quot; was not secured by President Hoover without a struggle with his Navy Board.
under article 21 of that treaty, as well as broaden its whole scope by the inclusion of the other categories of ships.&quot;The Italian answer raised no contentious points, but opportunity was taken to invite the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the well-known attitude of Italy on problems of general disarmament and naval disarmament in particular.The French reply was rather longer, and made the important point that the &quot; express object &quot; of the conference would be to facilitate the task of the Preparatory Commission and that of the future General Disarmament Conference.The Japanese Government replied in friendly and co-operative terms, but instructed their Ambassador in delivering it to state orally that the Japanese Government would demand a 70 per cent, ratio in auxiliary craft.IX.-The Prime Minister^ Yisit to the United States and his conversations with President Hoover.Mr. MacDonald sailed for New York on the 28th September and reached that port on the 4th October, proceeding on the same day to Washington. On the 5th October the Prime Minister, accompanied by Miss MacDonald, Sir R. Vansittart and Mr. Craigie, drove to Mr. Hoover&apos;s &quot; camp&quot; on the Rapidan River in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where they were received by the President and his staff, Mrs. Hoover and the Secretary of State, Colonel Stimson.Sunday, the 6th October, was devoted in its entirety to conversations between Mr. Hoover and Mr. MacDonald, Colonel Stimson, Sir R. Vansittart and Mr. Craigie being present throughout. Mr. Cotton, the Under-Secretary of State, was sent for in the morning and arrived after lunch. The discussions that took place were throughout friendly and informal but none the less comprehensive on that account, dealing with a variety of matters relating to Anglo-American relations; in this paper, however, it is intended only to mention, necessarily briefly, what occurred in connexion with the naval problem.The whole field of this question was covered in the endeavour to eliminate all points likely to divide the United States and ourselves at the London Naval Conference, and in this connexion mention was made of (1) battleships, (2) cruisers, (3) aircraft carriers, (4) destroyers and (5) submarines.As regards (1) Mr. Hoover emphasised that the United States did not desire to build any more capital ships before 1936, which amounted to a suggestion for a &quot;building holiday&quot; up to that year. The objection to this was that it would result in the dislocation of shipbuilding yards in this country, to a spurt in construction after 1936, and the retention in our navy of vessels of more than thirty years in age. Our proposals, calling for the reduction of displacement tonnages from 35,000 to 25,000, the decrease of gun calibre from 16 to 12 inches, and the prolongation of life from twenty to twenty-six years, would meet the Admiralty view that there should be no reduction in the number of capital ships, and at the same time (by the extension of the age limit) ipso facto reduce replacements before 1936. It was subsequently ascertained in the course of discussions at the State Department that the United States Government might be induced to accept our proposals provided that they were allowed to build one 35,000-ton ship to compensate for His Majesty&apos;s ships&quot; &quot;Hood&quot; (41,000 tons), &quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; (35,000 tons each).*When the cruiser situation was reviewed, a new point of some importance emerged : the President had found that the General Board of the United States Navy were more disposed to extend the &quot; Yardstick &quot; in our favour by the use of the age factor than by any other means. For every 6-inch cruiser of twenty years&apos; service and over we should be granted a very considerable discount, as much as 50 per cent, being mentioned. While the President appeared genuinely anxious to reduce the United States maximum of 8-inch cruisers to eighteen, he saw no way of achieving this result so long as we insisted on a cruiser tonnage of 339,000 and a replacement programme of fourteen vessels. Mr. Hoover seemed prepared to meet us half-way if we could devise any method of eliminating the difference of 30,000 tons referred to in Part II of this paper. It was decided at Rapidan that both sides should continue to examine ways and means by which this gap might be bridged.Aircraft carriers, destroyers and submarines gave rise to no difficulty. It was suggested, on the American side, that the total tonnage for the first type of vessel* not, In regard to this it should be noted that &quot; Hood&quot; has&apos; only 15-inch guns, and that the United States of America have three modem battleships with 16-inch guns, comparable to &quot; Nelson &quot; and &quot; Rodney.&quot;
be reduced from 135,000, as at present, to 120,000, and that a higher minimum unit displacement should be fixed to prevent aircraft carriers from dropping down into the cruiser class.One hundred and fifty thousand tons was tentatively agreed as a total tonnage figure for destroyers with the proviso that if France insisted upon the maintenance of 90,000 tons in submarines we would have to increase this figure to 200,000 tons.In submarines, the United States would be willing to reduce to our level of 50,000 tons. Moreover, they would have no objection to Japan retaining 70,000 tons of these units.   (We could not agree to such a proportion for Japan.)It also transpired that the United States would be quite agreeable to a 10 per cent, transfer between categories, though it was appreciated that France would probably hold out for a greater percentage than this.Two other questions intimately connected with the naval problem were discussed, namely, rights and immunities at sea in time of war and naval bases. As regards the former, the President drew attention to the view widely held in the United States that good relations with Great Britain could never be fully established until the issue had been squarely faced. Senator Borah held the opinion that the &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; should be dealt with before any naval disarmament agreement was attempted. The President also developed at some length his scheme that ships loaded exclusively with food supplies should be accorded the same treatment as hospital ships. He felt that in the light of Great Britain&apos;s dependence upon imported food supplies, this should be of great benefit to this country. Finally, he emphasised the point that it was extremely unlikely the world would ever agree to another food blockade.Seeing that the United States Government were convinced that the &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; must be raised in one form or another, the Prime Minister undertook to go into the matter carefully, and obtained the concurrence of the President in two suggestions of importance : (1) That the right method with which to prepare for the international discussion of this question would be the initiation of preliminary and informal discussions between the United States and ourselves on the lines of his negotiations with General Dawes; and (2) that even these discussions should be postponed until after the Five-Power Conference.As regards naval stations, the President confirmed that the existence of our fortifications in close proximity to the United States had provided elements opposed to a naval agreement with a useful pretext for unfriendly propaganda. The Prime Minister explained the purely defensive nature of the fortifications at Bermuda and Jamaica, and intimated that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no intention of modifying these defences or establishments so as to turn them into a menace to the United States. It was decided that this question also should be further examined on the Prime Minister^ return to London.X.-Events since the Prime Minister&apos;s Return.Mr. MacDonald and his staff returned from the United States and Canada in the first week of November, and a start was immediately made in the preparations for the conference. Within a few days of his return the Prime Minister had received the French, Italian and Japanese Ambassadors, and had discussed with them a variety of points connected with the naval negotiations. Latterly, interviews have also taken place at the Foreign Office with the counsellors of the French, Italian and Japanese Embassies, to whom the fullest possible information in regard to our proposals has been furnished.Perhaps the most important question dealt with in these conversations has been the Japanese demand for a 70 per cent, ratio in auxiliary vessels, which, it will be remembered, was first put forward officially, by the Japanese Ambassador on the 16th October. Since the Prime Ministers return from the United States, M. Matsudaira in London and M. Debuchi in Washington have spared no effort to press this demand, although in neither capital have the Japanese representatives met so far with any success. Mr. MacDonald has made it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not consent to Japan maintaining a 70 per cent, ratio of the United States strength in 8-inch cruisers, as this would entail practical equality in this type of ship between Japan and the British Empire, pointing out in doing so that as matters stand to-day Japan already has 74 per cent, of the British Empire cruiser tonnage. In Washington Colonel Stimson has informed M. Debuchi that an increase in the Japanese auxiliary ratio from 60 to 70 per cent, would undermine the
status quo in the Pacific, suggesting that this was agreed to on the basis of the 5:5:3 ratio. The whole question is understood to have been further discussed in Washington during the recent brief visit paid to that city by the Japanese delegation en route to London. Notwithstanding the unfavourable reception accorded to their proposals, there is no indication that the Japanese Government are weakening in any respect in their claim to have a 70 per cent, ratio.Conversations have also been taking place between France and Italy in the hope that they might find it possible to arrive at an agreement before the meeting of the conference on naval policies. Italy demands the right of parity with France, who, however, is not disposed to agree on the ground that, in addition to being a Mediterranean Power, she has extensive coastlines and trade routes to protect west and north of Gibraltar. In this connexion, the French Government are not unmindful of the new German &apos;&apos; pocket battleships &apos;&apos; which outclass the &quot;Washington Treaty&quot; cruisers, or of Spanish naval ambitions. No result has yet been achieved by these Franco-Italian conversations, which have led, however, to (1) a shrewd bid on the part of Italy for the support of the United States and ourselves through her sudden decision to advocate the abolition of the submarine, and (2) a suggestion by France that all the Mediterranean Powers, including Spain and the others not to be represented at the Five J?ower Conference, should participate in a treaty of mutual guarantee and non-aggression. This proposal is not viewed favourably by His Majesty&apos;s Government.[20254]F
