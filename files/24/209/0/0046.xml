R.B T.47  (30)CABINET,2*iADVERTISEMENTS REGULATION ACTS  (AMENDMENT) BILL. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.This Bill proposes to make far reaching amendments in the byelaw making powers conferred on local authorities by the Advertisements Regulation Acts,  1907 and 1925.    As the Home Office is the Department responsible for confirming byelaws under these Acts and would likewise be responsible in respect of byelaws made under this Bill,  I have a direct interest in the provisions of this Bill.In so far as the Bill is designed to extend the range of protection against unsightly advertisements now given by the existing Acts,  I have every sympathy with it, but in my opinion the experience gained by the Home Office from the administration of these Acts, which covers in all a period of more than 20 years, has shown conclusively that the byelaw system-which this Bill seeks to enlarge is not well adapted for dealing with this class of nuisance and if the Bill passes it will inevitably place a burden on the administrative machine which the machine is neither equipped for nor capable of undertaking.Under the Advertisements Regulation Acts,  1907 and 1925, County Councils, Borough Councils,  and Urban District Councils (having a population of over 10,000)  can make byelaws for protecting the amenities of a public park or pleasure promenade, the natural beauty of a landscape, rural scenery,  a village in a rural district,  or the amenities of any historic or public building or monument or of any place frequented by the public solely or chiefly on account of its beauty or historic interest,.This Bill will have a twofold effect:(l)    By removing the population bar of 10,000 to make all Urban District Councils byelaw making authorities.document is the..property of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government).
(2)    To enable byelaws to be made for protecting the appearance or amenities of any district.    In other words it will remove the limitation on the classes of places whioh may be protected under the existing Acts and give a complete discretion to a looal authority to protect by byelaw any part of its area which it thinks fit.As regards  (l) I would remind my colleagues that the Royal Commission on Local Government considered the position of the smaller Urban Districts in the matter of these byelaws and recommended that no alteration should be made in the present arrangement by which County Councils make byelaws for them. I do not however propose to stress this point, because it is of small importance compared with the main objection which I have to the Bill as it stands,  and I consider that there is another method by whioh the smaller Urban Districts could obtain the power which they are seeking.My objection to the Bill is an objection to the.extension of the byelaw procedure.    It is obvious that the result of its provisions would be to enlarge enormously the number of byelaw codes which would be submitted to the Home Office for approval. Hot only will there be a substantial increase in the number of byelaw making authorities but owing to the proposed wide extension of the byelaw powers to cover urban areas a whole multitude of looal authorities who have not used their present powers will use the extended power to protect their amenities.Having regard to previous experience the Department would be most reluctant to undertake this extra work.    The essence of the byelaw system is to frame local laws, within the limits laid down by the enabling statute, to meet special local condition and byelaws ought to contain definite provisions which are readily comprehended and easily applicable in any particular case. Byelaws couched in vague and uncertain terms have repeatedly been declared by the Courts to be bad.    When however County
Councils came to make byelaws under the existing Acts for their -areas,  they maintained that they could not make a detailed code nor could they make a selection of the places which should be protected.    On the contrary they insisted on making a vague general byelaw which (subject to an exemption for advertisements displayed on trade and other premises) repeated verbatim the words of the Act and they insisted on applying this to the whole of their jurisdiction.    My predecessors and I have been compelled to assent to this course, because no other course was declared to be practical.This byelaw has indeed been upheld by a decision of the High Court  (United Bill Posting Company Limited v. The Somerset County Council, 42 T.L.R.557),  the Court taking the  view that the element of uncertainty lay rather in the subject matter than in the phraseology of the byelaw.    But this decision instead of providing arguments for supporting the byelaw system has shown that the question whether a particular advertisement disfigures a view cannot be prejudged by a byelaw but can only be determined on the spot by a knowledge of the particular circumstances of a particular case,    In other words each case must be judged on its merits and it is quite impracticable for a byelaw to prescribe canons of taste or to circumscribe areas for protection.The Byelaw system was never intended to be used for merely repeating the words of a statute,  and a Minister who confirms the same general byelaw for every area in the Kingdom is serving no useful purpose.    The position is also mischievous because while he would in fact be compelled to act automatically he would give to Parliament and the country the mistaken impression that he was acting judicially.If the present Bill passes I shall be pressed to allow     v similar vague byelaws based on its phraseology for every rural and urban area in the country and in view of the Somerset decision it would be exceedingly difficult for me to refuse. On the other hand I might find myself urged by commercial and
advertising interests to insist that byelaws should be confined to certain well defined areas and if I were to take the view that this was the proper course I would then be confronted with the almost impossible task of deciding which areas should be protected and which should be left out.    This could only be achieved with the aid of an army of inspectors and at a needless waste of public money.In my view if the principle of controlling advertisements generally in urban areas is accepted by Parliament there is only one practicable form of machinery and that is to give to local authorities a general power to object to any advertisement whioh disfigures such amenities as may be selected by the Act for protection and in the event of the person responsible refusing to remove it to have the matter determined by a summary court, subject if necessary to an appeal to Quarter Sessions.    A private member&apos;s Bill framed on those lines after consultation with the Home Office was introduced in 1921 and rejected on second reading in the House of Lords on the ground that it -would damage trade. On the other hand public resentment against unsightly advertisements has increased considerably during the last nine years and it is now the practice of tho Ministry of Health to insert-in Town Planning Schemes provisions on these lines for the protection of residential areas and public and private open spaces.    A copy of the Town Planning provision is attached.As there is a second reading opposition to the Bill,  it is likely that it may be challenged by advertising and commercial interests.    In my opinion the proper course for the Government is to express sympathy with the objects of the promoters but to point out the inherent defects of the byelaw system and to say that if Parliament is prepared to give a second reading to the Bill, the Government must take steps to see that the byolaw machinery is dropped and a more simple and direct method sub-stituted on the lines of the Town Planning provision.    In
15th February,  1930.particular emphaais should be laid on the point that the control of advertisements Is essentially a local matter to be determined by the responsible persons of the locality and the use of a Central Department as a tribunal is not called for,  Is not justified, and would not indeed be effective.I shall be glad to have the approval of my colleagues to my taking this line during the second reading debate.J.
