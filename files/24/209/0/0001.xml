 this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAMTIC majesty1 s government).CABINET.Secret. Copy No,oVp.k 30).road traffic bill.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.The Road Traffic Bill has passed through its Committee Stage in the House of Lords with little material alteration except in one respect.     After a short debate, Part V, which enables those local authorities who are already authorised by Parliament to conduct transport services to establish and extend omnibus services without further recourse to Parliament, was struck out.The proposal of the Bill was briefly to empower such local authorities(a) to run public services vehicles on any roadwithin their own district, and(b) subject to the consent of the Traffic Commissioners,to run such services on any other roadc In arriving at their decision, the Commissioners are to have regard to the extent to which the requirements of the authority&apos;s district&apos; will be served.      The Bill also conferred the necessary consequential powers of purchasing land and erecting buildings, of borrowing for the purposes authorised and of entering into working and other agreements with other local authorities and companies.The opposition was based upon the general argument that the provisions of the Bill would extend municipal trading and there is reason to believe that the opposition was backed by the
railway companies and private road transport undertakings.Like the local authorities themselves, I attach great importance to this Fart of the Bill and i regard it as closely connected with the preceding Part IV, under which the local authorities in question will lose their licensing jurisdiction. It may &quot;be said that thay had no right to exercise that jurisdiction in favour of themselves as operators of road transport;  at the same time it enabled them to have legitimate regard to the economic requirements of their district and to refuse permission to an unnecessary and unwise flooding of the roads with rival services.      But whatever advantage they may then have had, they will now lose any control over their local transport.    It is, therefore, in my opinion both opportune and necessary that they should be put on an equality with private enterprise in the matter of reasonable extensions of their existing services.   Road Transport Companies do not require special Parliamentary powers and it is unreasonable that local authorities should any longer be forced to the great expense and delays involved in Parliamentary procedure.      The situation in which the municipalities find themselves is, indeed, unfair. If they apply for- parliamentary powers in advance of requirements, they have a difficult case to make out, while if they wait until the requirements are obvious it is difficult to prevent the private operator getting in, especially as he is usually aware of the local authority&apos;s intention.,I ought perhaps to point out that statutory Tramway Companies are under a similar disability in that they require special Parliamentary powers to run omnibus services and if the point is raised It may be necessary to consider whether it should not be met.
(Intd.)   H.M.^    .,, ^ ...............   .Lord Russell, whose skilful handling of the Bill has carried it through its first stage with so little alteration, informs me that in his view it would he a mistake to ask the House of Lords to re-insert Part v upon Report.      I should, however, propose to make it clear in my speech on Second Reading in the House of Commons that it is the Government&apos;s intention to move the necessary amendments in the Committee of that House, and I should he glad to have the authority of the Cabinet for this procedure.      It is also for consideration whether some general intimation of the Government&apos;s intention should not he given before the Bill finally leaves the House of Lords, and in that event whether the statement should be made upon Report or upon Third Reading.I take this opportunity of asking that a day may be reserved for the Second Reading of -the Bill in the House of Commons early in February.        On this matter I have already written to the Chief Whip.
