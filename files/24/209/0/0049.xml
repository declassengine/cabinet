S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 SETCopy No,.50(30)C A B I NETCANAL   BOATS   bill memorandum BY THE MINISTER OP HEALTH.I understand that there Is now a probability of the Canal Boats Bill coming before a standing Committee in the very near future, and it is therefore necessary to decide what action we should take with regard to it.As my colleagues are aware, the main object of the Bill is to prohibit children under 15 living in, or travelling on a canal boat.     There is considerable opposition to the Bill as It stands, and unless either the Government take up the Bill, whioh, in present circumstances is obviously impracticable, or some compromise is achieved, it seems clear that the Bill cannot become law.But during the Debate a general feeling manifested itself in favour of the two main objects underlying the Bill, namely, the elimination of child labour and provision of complete educational facilities for the children, and the parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Health speaking during the Debate, said that she was authorised by the Promoters to say that they were willing to discuss means of attaining these ends.The most promising line of approach seems to be a compromise based on the recommendations of what is known as the Chamberlain Report, i.e. the Report of the Committee on Canal Boats which was appointed In 1920 under the chairmanship of Mr. Chamberlain.     The main recommendation of this Committee was that children of school age should be prohibited from living in canal boats during the term times of the schools which they are attending.
14th February, 1930With regard to the question of Child Labour, I am advised that the position Is already safeguarded by existing legislation.But if the Promoters of the Bill accept this compromise and can bh this basis secure the withdrawal of opposition to the Bill, I think they will not unreasonably ask that the Government should facilitate the passage of the Bill, and I submit that I should be authorised to Inform them that If they can reach such a compromise, the Government will do their best to find time for the later stages of the Bill.I should add there is one point not covered by the Chamberlain Report, on which there is strong feeling that some action should be taken; and that is the prohibition Of children living at all on barges carrying refuse.     This is a very limited problem which I am looking into at the moment and I do not anticipate that there would be any opposition to the steps required to stop the practice -indeed I observe that the Opposition have already put an amendment on the paper to achieve this very object,(Intd)   A.G.inistry of Health, Whitehall, S.W.I.
