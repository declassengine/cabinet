(29) 22.CAB I N E T.COMMITTEE ON THE FIGHTINGSERVICES.NAVAL    CONSTRUCTION    PROGRAMME1929.The Cabinet Committee on the Fighting Services have had under consideration the question of the Naval Construction Programme for 1929 In relation to the forthcoming London Naval Conference on Limitation and Reduction of Armaments. They have had before them a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequor on the financial aopect of the Naval Conference (F.S.  (29) 18), a commentary theroon by the First Lord of the Admiralty (F,S,  (29) 19), and a joint report by the Treasury and Admiralty on Navy Estimates 1930, 2,      The Fighting Services Committee is unable to make any recommendation as yet in regard to a long range programme, and this will probably have to be postponed until after the Naval Conference.3,      The present report only deals with the Construction Programme for 1929 and the recommendations of the Committee are as follows:-The following ships should be laid down for the 1929Programme: -1 cruiser of 6,500 tons;1 destroyer leader;4 destroyers;4 sloops;
3 submarines;   but these will be suspended pending the result of the London Naval Conference; that is to say,  they will not be included in the original Estimates for 1930, and if they have to be laid down after the Conference, a supplementary Vote will be necessary,4.     The reduction, as compared with the original programme for 1929,  is as follows:-Total cost,  1 Cruiser of 6500 tons 1,600,0004 Destroyers 1,303,0002 Sloops 280,0001 Depot Ship 950,0001 Net Layer 250,0003 Submarines. 920,0005,. 505, 000&apos; The saving involved on the ost.lrnc.ted liability in 1930 amounts to  1,418,932;&quot;or,  if the three suspended submarines are not built,  3,710,244,5.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer only consented to the above programme on the condition that cortain reductions are made on other items of the Navy Estimates in addition to a reduction of over  2,025,000 already secured by the Admiralty. These further savings are estimated to amount to a sum-of  750,000 dorived from the follo?;ing sources(a) No oil fuel reserve will be laid down.(b) The proposed increases will not be made in the Fleet Air Arm,(c) Cordite and torpedoes.(d) Stores generally.-2-
The First Lord pointed out that this would imvolve serious considerations in regard to certain items, hut undertook to do his best to secure as substantial reductions in these or other directions as possible. 6.     The above programme is the minimum construction necessary to avoid heavy discharges in Dockyard labour. If the whole of the new constructionmprograimue for 1929 had been scrapped, no less than 2,000 men would have to be discharged.    In our proposals the discharges will be reduced it is hoped to some 600 men,  spread over a period of-twelve months.7.      It is only fair to the Sea Lords of the Admiralty that we should place on record, for the information of the Cabinet, that they are not satisfied that this programme provides the minimum amount of naval construction essential for national security.(Initialled)    J.R.M.31/12
