NAVY ESTTiviATBS 1930.Joint Report by the Admiralty and Treasury on Navy Estimates1930.1. In accordance with the decision of the Fighting services committee at their 6th Meeting, held on the 14th November, 1929, we have examined the Naval Construction Programme for 1929 and the Sketch Navy Estimates for 1930 with a view to se e ing whe th er the desire of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for a reduction of  5,000,000 on the 1929 Navy Estimates could be fulfilled, and if so how.2. The draft Estimates in their present sketch form showa net total of  53,840,000, a reduction of  2,025,000 on the 1929 total of  55,865,000.       This is on the assumption that a shadow cut of  2m, will be applied, instead of  2,400,000 as in 1929.       We are satisfied that a higher figure than  2 a,would not be justifiable.        In additionvthe Admiralty have offered in the course of our disoussion, to affect further savings amounting to  55,000 on production of Torpedoes and Cordite. 3. The greater part of the reduction of  2m is due to thelower provision for New Construction ( 7,214,000 compared with  8,621,000 in 1929, a saving of  1,400,000) and to the average numbers for Yote A being about 4,000 less in 1930 (94,000 instead of 98,000), with a consequent saving of about  400,000. If the future construction programme is carried out as proposed by the Admiralty, the provision for Now Construction v/ill rise to about  10,000,000 in 1932, when the effeot of the reduction of the 1928 Programme disappears.      The Vote A numbers also will rise gradually after 1930, as although partly due to administra-tive economics, they are partly the result of the smaller 1928
*Programme.The &quot;stabilised&quot; Navy Estimates,  if the future Construction Programme is carried out to its full extent, are expected to amount to  57/58 millions, with a figure of 97,000 for Vote&apos; A.4. We are agreed that the only possibility of achiovingthe full x-eduction of  5,000,000 in the 1930 Estimates would be by the elimination of the whole 19 9 Programme except the two Sloops already begun.       There are, it is true,  questions of policy outside the New Construction Programme which are already under discussion, notably whether any addition to the war reserve of oil fuel and to the flights of the Pleet Air Arm should be made in 1930, which if decided against the Admiralty views would reduce the Estimates by over  400,000.    The Treasury have also indicated other expenditure which will be matter for further discussion when the Sketch Estimates are considered in detail.5.       In all, however, the utmost possible reductions outside the New Construction Programme cannot exceed.  750,000, so that the minimum sum remaining to be found out of the provision for New Construction would be  2,170,000.6. Proyision in the Sketch Estimates for the 1929 programme is  2,841,000, before applying the shadow cut, made up of - 2 Cruisers ............. 681,0809 Destroyers ..........- 970,0006 Submarines ........... 523,625* 2 of which have            *6 Sloops -............... 426,590already been                   1 Submarine Depot Ship.. 141,480started with                  1 Net layer............. 9^&apos;?n^Treasury approval.         Steam and Motor Boats... 3,100 2,841,375The shadow out is expected to. amount to about  400,OOO, reducing the total provision to about  2,400,000. 7. It is obvious therefore that, if no more than 2,830,000 can be saved outside of New Construction, the only way in which the full saving of  5 million can be reached is by
suspending the whole of the 1929 Programme with the exception of the 2 Sloops already begun,   (for which provision of about  150,000 is included in the above total).8. If the Government are not prepared to go as&amp;r as this, but still require that a substantial cut should be made in the cost of the New Construction Programme,  it would appear necessary that the Admiralty should, assign an order of priority to the various items of this Programme, showing which they would prefer to sacrifice, on the assumption that savings of a given amount must be achieved.9. On this question the Admiralty view is that apart from financial difficulties, there is an unanswerable case for each item in the Programme * They maintain that unless the two cruisers are laid down, we shall Inevitably fall short of the Cruiser policy contemplated by the American conversations and now to be laid before the Conference.        In the Admiralty view, the Destroyers, Submarines and Sloops are to replace vessels going oat of service, and only the Submarines can be considered capable of being affected by any decision of the Conference.       The omission or suspension of any part of the Programme now will in their opinion mean either that our strength will be reduced out of proportion to other Powers, or that v/e oust increase our rate of building, and therewith the amount of our Estimates, later on, in order to overtake arrears.       An irregular rate of building is administratively most unsatisfactory, and causes the maximum disturbances of employment.       Subject, however, to its being understood that this is their opinion, the Admiralty consider that the items of the Programme can be placed in the order of import-ance shown in Appendix A.10. The Treasury do not for the present seek to dispute theAdmiralty conclusions, because they are unable to accept the premises from which these conclusions are drawn   namely, that the Pleet must consist of a given number of ships of a given size to be decided at the present juncture.       They are not without hope
that the Oonference &quot;may pave the way for an all-round reduction of armament a on a greater scale than the Admiralty anticipate; and they consider that it would he wrong to authorise any further building until the results of the Conference are known. 11. Ih particular, any decision taken now in regard toSubmarines appears to the Treasury to be inconsistent with the policy of abolition of that class, which, it is understood, H.M. Government Intend to put forward at the Conference.      The Admiralty recogrd.se that it may be desirable on grounds cf policy to suspend any fresh Submarine building pending the Conference, and they have accordingly plaoed these vessels at the bottom of the order of priority.12. further,  it appears to the Treasury that, although the1929 Programme may be regarded as technically part of the 5 year Programme authorised by the Conservative Government in 1925, it is in reality the first instalment of a new Programme based on a new policy, to be sanctioned by a new Government, and submitted for approval to a new Parliament. It would bo necessary, in theopinion of the Treasury, to make a formal announcement of the new policy in the form cf a White Paper before Parliament is asked, to debate the Navy Estimates.       But as the Conference is likely to sit until nearly the end of March, and the Navy Estimates must be presented before February 20th at latest,  it might well prove impossible to make any such announcement without prejudicing the discussions at the Conference.13. The Treasury recommend therefore that considerations ofthis question be postponed until after the Conference, and that meanwhile Navy Estimates be fixed provisionally at a total, of  50,865,000,  i.e.,  5m. less than the present figure.      Such amount, if any, as may hereafter be sanctioned for the 1929 New Programme would be left to be provided in a Supplementary Estimate as early as possible in-the new financial year. This was in faot the policy followed by the Conservative Government in 1925. -    The
Treasury realise that the uncertainty arising from this delay may be inconvenient hut it appears to them that any ether decision at this stage would he a grave mistake.14.       On the assumption that the Conference will have finished its work by March 21st, 1930, it should still be possible to commence any new work that may be sanctioned early in the financial year 1930. 15. As regards this proposal, the Admiralty desire to say that from the point of view of the Dockyards and shipbuilding generally, the position now is entirely different from what it was when a decision on the Programme was delayed at the beginning of 1925.    At that time the five Cruisers laid down by the Labour Government, the &quot;NELSON&quot; and &quot;RODNEY&quot;, and other vessels were building,  and with this old programme, of well over  7,000,000 and a Reconstruction Programme of  1,OuO, 000 in hand, the Dockyards and industrial centres were not seriously affected by a delay of a few months in the settlement of the new programme.       But if a similar course be now adopted,  it will &quot;bo necessary to provide in the Estimates for a reduction of a further 2,000 men from the-Dockyards, and the discharges must actually start on or before the 1st April next. The Admiralty feel that the procedure will, in fact, cause disturb-ance, hardship and the maximum of anxiety in the Dockyard towns, the Clyde, the Tyne, at Barrow and elsewhere.16. As regards the specific questions put to us, concerning thepossibility of extending the life of the present Cruisers and of substituting a smaller vessel of say 4,500 tons for that proposed, we report as follows:-The existing life of a Cruiser is put at 20 years.     She first becomes due for major repairs after 8 or 9 years&apos;  service, and this has to be repeated after a further period of say 8 years.    The second repair is 50y0 more expensive than the first, and after that the maintenance in a seaworthy condition becomes increasingly expensive.       In the case of our war-time Cruisers, with comparatively
thin plating, whic h-suffered from exceptionally hax*d usage In their early years, the admiralty are definitely of opinion that to attempt to prolong their lives for more than 2 0 years would &quot;be useless;      the ships at that age would not he fit for service, and the expense of keeping them merely seaworthy would be out of all proportion to their efficiency as active units of the Fleet. 17. The Treasury realise that the war-time Cruisers constitute a peculiar difficulty;     moreover, even if their lives were prolonged for 4 years,  the critical period of exceptional &quot;run-out&quot; would not be evaded, but only deferred for 4 years.      In spite of this, however, they think that the question should he left open for consideration at the Naval Conference, at which it may have an important bearing.IB. As regards size, a 6,,5uO ton Cruiser costs about 1,600,000;      one of 5,500 tons about  1,300,000:;      one of 4,000 about  1,000,000. It would be possible therefore to build 3small Cruisers for less than the cost of two large.       The cost of maintenance is estimated at  170,000 per annum for one 6,500 ton Oruiser and  126,000 per annum for one 4,000 ton Cruiser. 19. The Admiralty, however, oonsider that nothing less than6,500 tons will meet their requirements.        The 4,000 or 4,500 ton Oruiser would be unfit in respect both of speed, armament and range of action for independent work as a Cx*uiser, being always liable to be put out of action by the bigger ships which other countries are building.       She co uld therefore only be used under cover of the battle fleet or of 8&quot; gun Cruisers.       But the Admiralty no?/ have 19 ships of 4,000 tons or thereabouts, which are an undue proportion for these duties of the total of 50 Cruisers referred to in the Jlcierioasi conversations?       An increase in that number would there-If ore give, them more than the number needed for duty with tie  Fleet land less than their requirements lor protecting trade and lines of froomunicat ion.       The admiralty point out that nothing is more Wasteful than the construction of ships that cannot carry out the-
duty assigned to them.20. The Treasury recognise the force of these arguments,but nevertheless think that the question is one of such importance in its bearing on the future cost of construction and maintenance of Cruisers, that it ought to be further examined by the Government before the Naval Conference.(Signed)   W.W.
