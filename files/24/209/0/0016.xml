ATTITUDE OP THE NEW ZEALABD PRESS.Extract iron letter from Mr. P. Nichols of the Staff of the Prime Minister of New Zealand to Mr. Dixon dated 28th November, 1S29TCirculated to the Cabinet for information by direction&apos; of the Prime Minister.3 SI S 2EIn the main, newspaper comment fastens upon the following points:    (l) the security of the Empire and (2) the need to consult and not to inform1 the Dominions. In the case of Singapore nearly all the leader writers emphasize the importance of the question from the purely New Zealand standpoint, which is unusual, as when discussing foreign or imperial affairs these writers are generally content to examine the matter in hand from the point of view of the Empire as a whole.Thus the &quot;Dominion&quot;, after summarising the recent history of the Base and giving a list of the contributors to the cost of the undertaking, proceeds:    &quot;The MacDonald Government has done enough to excite alarm and uneasiness in the Dominions bordering on the Pacific.    It may claim that slowing down does not necessarily mean stoppage. The fact remains that slowing down the operations means the
postponement of their completion,  of the time when the Base would represent established security and protection for the Dominions concerned.    The substantial tax the contributory States have placed upon themselves shows that the desire for security is very real, and should not be trifled with. Viscount Jellicoe rs reported comment indicates that he has fully appreciated the strength and direction of overseas opinion.    rI have my doubts how they will take the decision1 he says.It is evident that the MacDonald Government expects from the impending Five Power Conference a dis-armament programme very much in advance of what public opinion anticipates.     Either that, or it considers that the slowing down of the work at the Base may   possibly influence the Conference in a favourable direction.      In either case  informing1 the Dominions of its decision instead of consulting them about it seems to fall con-siderably short of its obligations in the matter.&quot;The &quot;Evening Post&quot; in a leading&apos;article entitled &quot;A Gesture - To Whom?&quot; examines the motives which may,  in the opinion of the writer, have inspired the Labour Party in Great Britain to decide to retard construction at the Base.        There is nov; no need for a moral gesture for peace such as underlay the decision to abandon the Base in 1-924. ITow is a gesture needed to America:    we have already reduced our cruiser construction and America has made a suitable reply.     Surely, however, the Base is required to render possible our acceptance of a smaller number of
cruisers of a less powerful type 0       Neither America nor Japan have received, the Singapore plan with suspicion and Mr. Tokugawa, on presenting his credentials as the first Japanese Minister to Canada, actually made a statement at the time to the effect that the Japanese Government never from the first had any fears concerning the Base.     The writer then goes on to summarise the New Zealand point of view as expressed publicly by Sir Joseph Ward and to point out that Australia under Mr. Bruce was equally emphatic; the article ends as follows:-   &quot;But an Australian Labour Government is now in power.    Has this any bearing upon the time chosen for retarding the work?      Labour has already decided to abolish compulsory military training,  and it would not be surprising if it were also to support the Singapore abandonment.      With less opposition to be encountered in the Pacific,  the British Labour Government may think that the time has arrived for another gesture - not to the Powers summoned to the London Conference, but to the left wing of its own party.&quot;The ,TEvening Post&quot; returned to the charge next day in a sub-editorial strongly urging that, so far as New Zealand was concerned, the decision should not be allowed to stand without protest.       &quot;At present abandonment is not mentioned, but the First Lord&apos;s statement may be viewed in two ways.      It may be considered a preparation for abandonment, or an indication that Britain, while proceeding with the work, is anxious not to give offence by its action, and
therefore has chosen to hasten slowly.      Whatever may be the motive, the Hew Zealand viewpoint should again he emphasized.      B&apos;ow Zealand menaces nobody, though some of our ardent pacifists talk as if our defence measures were blocking.- disarmament;    but we are vitally concerned in the safety of our trade routes.      .e cannot view complacently the possibility of a bargain destroying that security&quot;.The &quot;Christchurch Star&quot; writes:    &quot;From the point of view of most of the overseas dominions only one thing can justify the British labour Governments latest decision in regard to Singapore,  and that is the hope of a fairly sweeping agreement on disarmament at the coming Five Power Conference.&quot;       The &quot;Morning Post&quot; is quoted as stating that Singapore is being treated as a bargaining counter and that the Government is ready to promise to remain defenceless in thP East if certain other Powers consent to modify their building programme. This attitude,  the writer continues, appears to take a good deal for granted.     Hot only does it treat with contempt the heavy contributions already made, but it flouts &quot;what is generally accepted as orthodox, naval opinion on the subject;      and the writer then summarises the advantages and objections to Singapore as a naval base.       &quot;It is only natural to assume however that these objections were carefully weighed by previous Governments and that the decision come to was that    : the Singapore Base was essential to the security of the
Empire.       Mr. Sumsay MacDonaldrs administration, according to a cablegram to-day, has now stopped what work it can and slowed down the rest, solely on the ground that a gesture of good faith is needed in connection with naval disarmament.       Pacifists may feel elated at this inspiring news, but most people will prefer to postpone their cheers until other nations follow suit with similar gestures of good faith.&quot;The &quot;Auckland Star&quot; after giving some account of the history of the Base and of the various contributions made towards its cost quotes with approval Mr. V/inston ChurchillTs utterances in Canada in support of Singapore.       The article ends with these words: &quot;It may be noted that Mr. Alexander told the House of Commons that the Dominions had been &apos;informed1 of the Governments decision.       But this is very different from being consulted, and surely under the circumstances the Imperial authorities ought to take,the Dominions completely Into their confidence before finally resolving on a step that so vitally concerns their safety and the interests of the whole Empire&quot;.The &quot;Hew Zealand Herald&quot; in an outspoken article which first urges that Hew Zealand should convey a protest, as Mr. Bruce conveyed a warning in July last on behalf of Australia, to the British Government, lest an impression should gain currency in Britain that New Zealand is unconcerned, goes on to say &quot;It is all very well for Mr. MacD nald Ts Government in a laudable
I&quot;    116eagerness to show the world that Britain desires enduring peace,  to multiply gestures of universal friendliness;      but it is going altogether too far to do this at the cost of national security.     Touching the reduction of naval armaments, Lord Jellieoe has affirmed that the British Uuvy has never been the cause of war - a thesis that is abundantly proved by a searching appeal to facts.     i^is declaration applies to the Singapore B-.se.       No aggressive intent is involved in its construction.&quot;       The writer then developes this thesis pointing out that Mr. Asquith exposed the falsity of the charge that the development of the base was an infringement of the Washington lVeaty.      The Japanese, the Chinese and the Batch &quot;have nothing to say against the Base.       These considerations suggest that &quot;something more than national security is to be attained,  in part, by making the Bcse fully serviceable. It will add to international security and promote international peace.       Has the British Government forgotten the lesson learned in recent years at Geneva, that security is a principle vital to peace?       Singapore has its own valuable contribution to make to a needed policing of a long stretch of the world&apos;s waterways. When the need is narrowed down to our own Empire, this Base is rightly valued as an essential link in the maritime defences requisite for the safe passage of our commerce. To use it as a counter,  in a bargain to be struck with other Powers less ready than Britain to reduce theirHan
floating armaments, is &apos;to gamble with the people&apos;s food in a way more perfidious than the phrase has ever otherwise been employed to mean&quot;.      The article then takes the Government to task for inconsistency.      &quot;Mr. Thomas has rightly pointed out that the solution of the Empires economic problem depends largely on the development of trade within the Imperial &quot;border.      On his visit to Canada he actually carried samples and took orders.      It was well done.      The more of tnat    sort of thing the better.     But of what use is it for him to try to build up business across wide spaces when other members ox his Government are bent on making those spaoes unsafe to traverse with goods?      So far as carrying coals to Canada is concerned, this particular base matters not at all;    but the principle at stake is clear.      More trade within the Empire,  as a means of decreasing unemployment and promoting economic safety, says the Government in ono breath, and in the next it Issues a fiat making that trade insecure over vital lanes of transport.      Could inconsistency go. further?     This is not statesmanship;    it is unpractical opportunism, a readiness to sacrifice the Empire for the sake of a vain idea.      They are not friends of the nation who so lightly play with what is vital to Its oxistence.      To the protests uttered in Britain there should be added the emphatic demur of every Dominion.&quot;The &quot;Qtago Daily Times&quot; makes a point which other papers also emphasize, viz. that the Home Government,  if employing as justification for its decision the argument that the results of the Naval Conference may affect the use of the Base, appears to look unnecessarily far ahead. &quot;The decisions of the Naval Conference cannot be safely anticipated, and, as the &quot;Morning post&quot; suggests, if the
Government thinks of making Singapore a means for bargaining with ether powers the method of procedure it contemplates is open to strong criticism.     Earl jellicoe has offered the timely reminder that the Dominions have contributed towards the oost of the Singapore Base in the belief that it is essential to their security.......... The circumstances havenot altered in the meantime.      The Empire is still dependent for protection upon the navy.     With tire concurrence of the Dominions Singapore has been singled cut as a highly important link of the Empire, and the Washington Treaty was drawn up explicitly to allow for the establishment of the naval base there.      The Labour Government at Home is acting peculiarly, to say the least of it,  in seeking pretexts for the discontinuance of an undertaking in which the Empire is deeply interested.&quot;On November 19th a cable message was published here reporting tho assurance given by the.Prime Minister in the House of Commons that the Dominions would be fully consulted before any decisions were taken affecting the Singapore scheme as a whole:    bhe same day the &quot;Evening Post&quot; had a leading article based on this message entitled &quot;Consult or Inform&quot; which gives a very fair account of the average New Zealand interpretation of the methods of consultation and negotiation employed both in regard to Singapore and to the Optional Clause.      As I think this article is, worth reading as a whole I enclose copies for your information.On November 23rd the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; also returned to the subject of Singapore, basing its article unon the cable messasre to which, reference Is made above.-.-The writer considers that Mr. MacDonald&apos;s expectations of the results of the Five Power Conference are probably
excessive.      &quot;The utmost to he hoped from the Five powers Conference is an agreement on a formula covering naval disarmament, this formula to be furnished to the League&apos;s preparatory commission as a part of necessary data for the completion of its initial task.     Thereafter its findings will become the basis of consideration by individual Governments, and time will have to be allowed for their examination of the proposals, the submission of their decisions in some detail to parliaments, and the giving of Instructions to delegations sent to the League conference. To hold up work at Singapore until all these steps have been taken would be a very serious thing, and protests from the contributing Dominions and colonies are therefore now in order.&quot;     The writer then proceeds to examine the genesis and history of the Base and draws the conclusion that the Dominions and Colonies have shown so much interest and have contributed so much money that &quot;The case for their being consulted before there ia any change of policy is consequently so strong as to call for little argument&quot;. The writer sums up the main arguments in favour of the Base as follows:    &quot;On the main aspect of the question also, little more needs to be said.      It was effectivoly uttered in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s declaration that certain bases abroad needed modernising and in some oases extending, including those of the pacific.      Those who regard cessation of the development of the base, beyond the privately-owned docks in the south of the island of Singapore, as an impressive gesture of peace, are in error.      The considered judgment of the Washington Conference of 1921-22, the favouring declaration of Japan, and the gratification of Holland at a decision making secure from molestation her valuable possessions in the Bast Indies, all emphasize the peaceful intent represented in the plan of developing the base.
With such, foreign agreement about that intent,  it is straining facts beyond reason to speak of cessation of work at Singapore as a gesture of peace.      It is admittedly giving up nothing of any seriously potential aggressive nature. The gesture is empty of real meaning.      In reality the Empire is dependent, and is likely to be dependent for many a day, on the mobility of its fleet, and for this mobility, in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and in the China Sea, adequate provision is required at Singapore.     When there is no longer any possibility of war, and the neeo for keeping Inviolate the sea highways that are the Empire&apos;s necessary avenues of inter-communication has vanished, the policy of adequately maintaining this base may be relinquished. Has that time arrived?     We must guard against a merely sentimental thought fathered by a wish.      Two ways only of enjoying vital Imperial security can be conceived;    either universal peace must be so fixedly established as to give security, or thore must bo sufficient means of defending the sea-roads.      whichever way is taken, the security must be complete.      Common sense dictates that adequate defence of the vitally necessary sea-roads must be maintained until all menace cf their safety has been removed by fully offeative international abandonment of war.      A security that rests on a peradventure is no security at all, and those who would complacently place it there are no true friends of peace&quot;.There have of course been other articles in minor newspapers from which I have forborne to quote:    the extracts given above will I think give a fair idea of the trend of thought among the more responsible papers, amongst which the &quot;Evening Post&quot; and the rti*cw Zealand Herald&quot; are the most important.X X X 3E
E H 0 L 0 SURE.EXTRACT FROM &quot;BVjSHIHG POST&quot;  (KEW ZEALAND) DATED OCTOBER 19th,-&apos;-1-&apos; -clause:-&quot;--CONSULT OR INFOR3S *-*-According to a cable message received to-day, an assurance has been given in the House of Cosmcns by Mr. MacDonald that the Dominions will be consulted before any decision ia taken affecting the Singapore Base as a whole. This Is more satisfactory than the earlier statement by the First Lord of the Admiralty that the Dominions had been informed of the decision to slacken work on the Base.      It may be accepted as an undertaking that Dominion Interest in the Base will be fully recognised and that Singapore will net be used as a bargaining counter unless the Dominions have their part in negotiating the bargain.- .  It would have been better still, however, If the decision to retard the work had also been reached after consultation.     The effect of that decision may not be far-reaching.     Three months&apos; slackening, or even cessation, of construction Is not of suoh great importance.     What is of importance is the impression that the British Government is inclined to take a separate course. No one will deny that Great Britain, as the senior partner and the one that bears the main burden of naval defence, must have a majority vote on this issue.     Even though the over-seas parts of the Empire have become contributors, and, In respect of Singapore, have contributed handsomely, they have not yet become equal partners in finance, and they cannot demand full equality in determining policy.Britain, in her generosity and wisdom, however, has voluntarily granted a voice in policy, hoping that the Dominions would ultimately recognise the responsibility as well as the privilege of partnership.     There has been some recognition, and it would be regrettable if the growing disposition to share the burdens of naval defence were checked by Britain&apos;s resumption of full authority.     There is probably no intentional disregard of Dominion opinion, but Mr. MacDonald&apos;s pursuit of peace and disarmament may set a pace which the outposts of the Empire cannot maintain.     War experiences are fresh in our minds, and we hesitate to exchange the substance of trade route security for something which appears to us rather less substantial.     Our misgivings hinder us from keeping abreast with Mr. MacDonald.     Full consultation is the only method of allaying such doubts. Without consultation the impression may bo deepened that the Labour Government policy centres on the United Kingdom, and that the Empire which Mr. J, H. Thomas discovered in 1924 is yet unknown to some of his colleagues.If the Singapore incident stood alone, it might give less reason for apprehension, but there was reason for disquiet also in the Optional Clause policy pursued at Geneva.      The subject of compulsory arbitration in inter-national disputes, and particularly adherenoe to the Optional Clause, was considered at the 1926 Imperial Conference. Lord balfour&apos;s Committee then reported that &quot;whilst the members of the Committee were unanimous in favouring the widest possible extension of the method of arbitration for the settlement of international disputes,  tho feeling was that it was at present premature to accept the obligations
under the Article in question&quot;.      The report added:A general understanding was reached that none of the Governments represented at the Imperial Conference would take any action in the direction of the acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court without bringing up the matter for further discussion.In some quarters that understanding was interpreted as an agreement to leave the question in abeyance until the next Imperial Conference, and consultation by cable and dispatches was not considered a sufficient substitute.      For example, &quot;Augur,&quot; writing in the &quot;Fortnightly Keview&quot;, considered Mr, MacDonald&apos;s action inconsistent with the reoognised need to strengthen the Imperial bend between the Mother Country and the Dominions.For reasons of party politics, or because he simply had not read the promise of 1926, Mr. MacDonald made his declaration at Geneva, thus bitterly offending the two most faithful Dominions, Australia and Hew Zealand, but supported by Ireland and South Africa, that is,  the two which have least interest in preserving the Empire.This is an exaggerated statement.      There was no &quot;bitter offence&quot;, but somo misgiving as to methods and some concern as to the apparent weakening of unity which resulted.The risks incurred in adherence to the Optional Clause -for example, the possibility of Ireland raising inter-Empire issues - have been overstated.     Nevertheless, there are objections to the course taken.      These were stated soberly and without exaggeration by &quot;The Times&quot;, which referred to &quot;the vagueness and uncertainty of the laws this Court is called upon to administer, and, in administering, to make&quot;. A Hague Conference for the codification of the law is to be held next year, but in the meantime there are &quot;notoriously wide and deep&quot; differences of opinion on many serious questions.     On one side is the Anglo-American tradition and on the other the Continental tradition.      &quot;The Times&quot; suggested it would have been prudent to await the result of c odif modifications ion.Let us know the law that is to govern our international relations before we undertake to acoept the inter-interpretations placed upon it by a Court where, so far as foresight is possible,  the general tone and current of thought will not bo those of our law,  our history, or our habits.So far as Hew Zealand is concerned, however, there is little reason for fear of the consequences of actual resort to the Court.     More disturbing is the suggestion that in the decision of this question there was less regard for Dominion opinion than there had been hitherto.      &quot;Augur&quot;remarked:From behind the scenes at Geneva, accounts reach us of Mr. MacDonald&apos;s &quot;superior&quot; attitude towards the Dominion representatives, which was resented by them, and which brought a stinging rebuke from Mr. M&apos;Gilligan, the representative of the Irish Free State.
Talk of Imperial unity may be overdone, until the term becomes a nauseating platitude;    but the method pursued by the Empire delegation at the Washington Conference is still infinitely preferable to that which has at times been in evidence at Geneva.     We do not suggest that Mr. MacDonald has departed deliberately from the Washington method.     By arranging for Dominion representation at the London Conference he has evinced his desire to maintain unity in consultation; but his eagerness for disarmament, what &quot;Augurn terms &quot;his messianic turn of mind and a lifelong connection with international socialism&quot; may make him impatient with Dominions that do not move so fast.      The earnest desire for a great immediate achievement may cause him to weaken the instrument -a united Empire - which in patient hands can yet exert the most powerful, though perhaps slow-working, force for peace.TJhitehall Gardens, SvW.1, 14th January, 1930.
