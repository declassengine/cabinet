This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;b Government,]279Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   December 1929.SECRET.Copy No.339-C.(Also Paper No. CCS. 214.)COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.PALESTINE SITUATION IN.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.1. AT their meeting on the 11th December, 1929, the Cabinet^ considered a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated the 28th November, 1929 (Appendix), covering a summary, compiled in the Colonial Office, of the material available in regard to warnings received, both from the Palestine Govern-ment and from other sources, in connection with the possible renewal of disorder in the near future, and it was agreed &quot; (a) that the situation in Palestine (including the Intelligence System)should be considered in the first instance by the Committee of Chiefs of Staff,who should then report on the subject to the Committee of Imperial Defence; &quot; (b) that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should communicate all necessary information to the Committee of Chiefs of Staff.&quot;2. In accordance with the above conclusion, we have discussed the present situation in Palestine, and to assist us the Colonial Office have placed a mass of information at our disposal under cover of a memorandum dated the 12th instant. We have not thought it necessary to attach this memorandum, with its many enclosures.The Possibility of Future Trouble.3. In the first place we would invite attention to the fact that none of the official warnings contained in the attached Colonial Office memorandum date from less than five weeks back, and the majority from 6 to 10 weeks. Some of the Police reports and most of the non-official reports consist of rumours, local press extracts, or highly-coloured opinions of Arab extremists. Such opinions must, we suggest, be largely discounted, and in forming conclusions as to the possibility of trouble on a large scale recurring in Palestine we feel that little of the information which has been supplied to us, apart from that emanating from the High Commissioner and the Air Officer Commanding, merits serious consideration.4. The element of &quot; danger &quot; to which the Secretary of State for the Colonies refers at the end of his memorandum is largely conditioned by our ability to prevent disturbances or to suppress them in their incipient stage, and we would particularly emphasise that in order to effect this it is of the utmost importance in the first place to have an efficient intelligence organization in order that timely warning of possible disturbances may be received, and, in the second place, to have an efficient and reliable police force to deal with minor incidents. We revert to these two desiderata m more detail later in the report. We might go so far as to say that the disorders which broke out in August might have been prevented had the police force and an adequate intelligence organization been more efficient.* Cabinet 52 (29), Conclusion 9.[20327]b
5. Our conclusions, then, with regard to the possibility of further outbreaks in Palestine, are as follows : (a.). Incidents between Jews and Arabs are bound to continue.(b.) Tt should be possible to eliminate such incidents to a large extent, providedthat an adequate intelligence organization is set up in the country, (c.) Such incidents should not, normally, lead to widespread disturbance, solong as adequate forces are available in the country to deal with them.Present Military Forces.6. The outbreak last August reached dangerous proportions, because the only military force available in Palestine to deal with it during the earlier stages was one section of armoured cars at RamlefT, 25 miles from Jerusalem. In Trans-Jordan there were other forces, namely, the Frontier Force, aeroplanes and more armoured cars, but these (see paragraph 9 below) have their own particular problems to solve on the desert frontiers.7. To-day, there are in Palestine ,2 battalions of infantry, with a total approximate strength of i,450, 12 aeroplanes, and 7 armoured cars, disposed as follows : NazarethAfuleSafadMet all aRoshpinaTiberiasHaifaAcreZichronNablusJaffaRamlehJerusalemHebron3 platoons, 1 section Armoured Cars.i platoon.3 platoons.1 platoon.1 platoon.i platoon.5 platoons, 1 section Armoured Cars.\ platoon.\ platoon.2 platoons.1 company.1 Squadron R. A.F.2 companies.2 platoonsTotal   ... ... ...      2 battalions Infantry.2 Sections Armoured Cars. 1 Squadron R.A.F.8. The force in Trans-Jordan consists of the Frontier Force, 12 aeroplanes, and 8 armoured cars. The force is primarily intended to prevent incursions of Arabs from Trans-Jordan into Palestine, and to deal with the problem of raids and counter-raids by the Bedouin tribes on the eastern frontier. In present circumstances this is a difficult task, since the large tract of country between the Hejas railway and the frontier is neither administered nor policed, with the consequence that lawlessness has to be tackled in the first instance by military forces instead of being dealt with in the incipient stage by police.9. Our conclusion with regard to the existing garrison in Palestine is that it is adequate to deal with any disorder normally likely to break out. At the same time we attach importance to plans being concerted for the despatch of reinforcements in the event of an abnormal emergency beyond the capacity of the existing garrison. Arrangements already exist for the despatch of reinforcements. Oil the request of the High Commissioner, supported by the Air Officer Commanding, the Air Ministry may ask the Admiralty for naval support or the War Office for reinforcements from Malta as may be deemed necessary. In a sudden emergency the High Commissioner can telegraph direct to the naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean or to the General Officer Commanding in Egypt.The Police Organisation.10. We have already emphasised that the prevention of disorder is primarily a police function, and we are convinced that no additions to the military forces in Palestine would ever have the same preventive effect as a well-organized and efficient police force backed by an adequate intelligence department.   Available reports leave
Intelligence Service.11. Time is of the utmost importance in dealing with matters of internal security, and unless adequate intelligence is available it is impossible to set the security force in motion early enough. We observe from the Appendix that no warning was received by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the imminence of the outbreak in Palestine, and it seems unlikely that the local Government itself was aware of the true situation.12. The only intelligence organization now in existence in Palestine is that under the control of the Police, and we are informed that little information is forthcoming from it. For example, oh 27 out of 33 days during September and October the Police had no information at all to publish in their daily situation report.Not only must the police owing to the nature of their present organization rely largely on rumour for their information, but it has been reported that since the August outbreak the Palestinian personnel of the junior ranks of the police have shown a tendency to withhold information regarding events in their districts from their senior officers.13. We are strongly of opinion that an adequate Intelligence Department should be organised in Palestine, the details of which are a matter for consideration between the Colonial Office and Air Ministry.Conclusions.14.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (a.) The disorders in x\ugust were  largely due to the lack of adequatepreventative forces in Palestine. (b.) The forces now available in the country are the minimum which should be maintained and, backed by the naval forces which now visit Palestine regularly, are, we consider, sufficient to deal with all disturbances likely to occur in normal circumstances, (c.) In the event of widespread trouble, reinforcements would be necessary; and to meet such abnormal circumstances the arrangements referred to in paragraph 9 have been concerted between the Departments concerned. (d) We attach the highest importance to the existence of an efficient police organisation, Avhich alone can be in the position generally to prevent trouble.   We strongly recommend that an independent and experienced police official (for example a high officer of the Indian Police) should be nominated to investigate the situation, (e.) We consider it of the utmost importance that an efficient intelligence depart-ment should be set up in Palestine, since early and accurate information of pending trouble is essential, if the spread of disturbances is to be prevented.H. TRENCHARD. CHARLES E. MADDEN. G. F. MILNE.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, December 20, 1929.[20327]little doubt that, apart from a few individuals, both the Arab and Jewish members of the police were valueless during the racial disturbances in August.While it is perhaps hardly for us to criticise the present organisation or employment of the police, we venture to express our strong conviction that the reorganisation required must amount to considerably more than merely an increase in the British section of the police force, which is now under consideration. We feel most strongly that the whole Police force requires reorganisation, and that in particular arrangements should be made to instil British influence, mentality and methods into the native force. We venture to recommend that an experienced and independent police official, such as an officer of high standing in the Indian Police, should be invited to proceed to Palestine and report on the police organisation, and should be appointed to supervise the process of reorganisation when approved.
SECRET.APPENDIX.\Papers Nos. C.lJ. ZA?t (29) . and COS. Ji 10.]CABINET.SITUATION IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Mr. LUNN informed the House of Commons on the 4th November that His Majesty&apos;s Government received no warning from the Palestine Government as to the imminence of the recent outbreak. If there should be a renewal of disorder in the near future, it Avould not be possible to make a similar statement. A series of warnings has been received both from the Palestine Government and from other sources, and I think that the time has come for me to bring the matter to the notice of my colleagues. A memorandum compiled in the Colonial Office and summarising the material available is circulated with this note.The most authoritative of the warnings are those contained in telegrams from the High Commissioner, copies of which were circulated to the Cabinet at the time of their receipt. It is not easy to estimate their precise weight. It is perhaps not unfair to remark that the telegrams dealt primarily with the rather controversial question of the reduction of the emergency garrison, and that the High Com-missioner&apos;s opinion as to the general situation may possibly have been somewhat coloured by his anxiety to resist the pressure which was being put upon him to accept the withdrawal of certain forces.It should also be noted that some, at any rate, of the information received has the appearance, in the absence of exact knowledge as to the reliability of the informants, of being little better than &quot;bazaar rumour,&quot; and further that both Jews and Arabs (especially Arabs) have shown a tendency to exploit alarmist reports as levers for forcing the Government to make concessions to their demands.It is also worth recording that anticipations of trouble on certain critical dates, such as the Day of Atonement on the 14th October and the anniversary of the &apos;&apos; Balfour Declaration &apos;&apos; on the 2nd November, were not in the event fulfilled.Nevertheless, after making all allowances, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the situation is one of great delicacy and not without some danger.Smmm+l.^-.cv&apos;:. - r&apos;:.-.:..;&quot;;/ / - p.November 28, 1929.Memorandum.The warnings of further disturbances which have been received may be classified according to their source under the following heads: A. The High Commissioner personally.B.-Official Reports received through the High Commissioner. C - Other reports as to Arab activities. D. Secret Intelligence Reports. E. Local Press.In addition, it is possible to quote F. Instance of a warning falsified by the event.
281A.(1.) High Commissioner&apos;s Telegram No. 189 of September ltf.&quot;Secret. The following is an Arab, point of view, not without interest and importance, regarding the recent disturbances. No disappointment is felt at circumstance that disturbances were promptly suppressed, and the explosion has in no sense assuaged anti-Jewish feeling which inspired them.Disturbances, on the contrary, are regarded as having been a trial of strength, the results of which have been most satisf3dng to the Arab extremists in that they learned from them two things, firstly, that Arabs in practically all other parts of Palestine where it was possible followed Jerusalem&apos;s example very rapidly; secondly, that Arabs in Trans-Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Iraq gave sympathetic response which was from their point of view prompt, adequate, gratifying and full of promise for the future. This view of situation is confirmed by much other evidence.&quot;(2.) High Commissioner&apos;s Telegram No. 204 of September 19.&quot;Following factors have to be taken into consideration in estimating the size of future garrison :  &quot;First, the latent deep-seated hatred of the Arabs for the Jews has now come to the surface in all parts of the country. Threats of renewed attacks upon the Jews are being. freely made and are only being prevented by visible presence of considerable military force. Recent events have united all Moslem factions in Palestine in hostility to Jews and in lesser degree to the Government, while Christian Arabs, partly through dislike of Jews and partly through fear of Moslems, are associating themselves with the latter in this attitude. I am informed that fraternising of Moslems and Christians in opposition to Jews has extended to Syria. Secondly, there are still in the new quarters of Jerusalem and in Telaviv consider-able numbers of Jewish refugees from the old city of Jerusalem, Hebron and the smaller Jewish settlements who dare not return to their homes until assured of adequate protection from attack. Such protection can at present only be afforded by the presence in those places of guards of British troops or British police. Thirdly, it has yet to be seen how Jewish Feast in October will pass off and what will be the effect on public opinion of infliction of punishment for offences committed during the disturbances. Fourthly, recent outbreak in Palestine had serious repercussions in Syria and the French were genuinely apprehensive of Moslem rising in Syria in support of Palestine co-religionists. Propaganda against immigration of Jews into Palestine has recently been conducted amongst Arabs in neighbouring countries on an extensive scale, and if there is a recrudescence of the disturbances in Palestine it is doubtful if incursions into Palestine by Arabs from beyond the frontier could again be prevented. From information that has reached me I believe it is not improbable that if, in their opinion, the British Forces in Palestine are reduced to such an extent as to endanger the peace of Syria, the French Government will make representations to His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject.Finally, in view of obligations undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Mandate and of world-wide criticism to which Mandate and the Government of Palestine have been exposed by recent events, I regard it as essential that no risk should be incurred of a repetition of disorder, and I submit that no considera-tions of economy should be allowed to stand in the way of providing the Government of Palestine with siimcient force to enable it to assure maintenance of order and safety of life and property of the Jewish population. Taking all these circumstances into consideration I am of the opinion, in which my civil advisers concur, that no reduction of infantry force now in Palestine can. safely be made until after the Day of Atonement and until after infliction of punishment for offences committed during the disturbances. By the time that those events are past it.is possible that the situation may have so improved as to permit of the withdrawal of one battalion; but even that reduction would probably have to be conditional on my being able to count upon receiving reinforcements &quot;from Egypt next April during Nebi Musa week which in view of the recent trouble is likely to be a critical time.&quot;
(3.) High Commissioners Telegram No. 245 of October 12.&quot; The situation continues highly unsatisfactory. The feeling of the Arabs against the JeAvs is still bitter. Boycott is being enforced and instigators are working clandestinely and avoiding detection. There is amongst the Arabs a growing feeling of hostility to the Government, which is being fomented by skilful propaganda conducted by Arab leaders. I am informed that this feeling is not as previously confined to political circles, but has now extended to lower classes of the population and to villagers. Apart from continued protests against injustice of Balfour Declaration the Arabs have recently submitted to me numerous complaints of injustice such as retention of Mr. Bentwich in the office of Attorney-General, harsh treatment they are receiving in being denied bail and heavy sentences awarded to them as compared with sentences on Jews convicted of similar offences. The issue of instructions to regulate proceedings at the Wailing Wall has been used to excite religious fanaticism of the Moslems. It is represented that these Regulations constitute a violation of the status quo in favour of the Jews and an encroachment on Holy Places of the Moslems. A full meeting of the Arab Executive has been summoned for the 12th October to consider the question of calling a general strike as a protest against the Regulations and other alleged acts of partiality and injustice. Younger Moslems declare that strike will be held whether the Executive approve it or not. The Chief Justice has informed me that a general policy of obstructing work of Assize Courts has been adopted by Arab members of the Bar. In cross-examining witnesses Counsel Avaste time on trivial and reiterated questions and when checked by the Court for wasting time they withdreAV from the case leaving the prisoner Avithout defence. The Chief Justice Avho has discussed the position with me has decided to proceed Avith trials even if prisoners are undefended. This will probably lead to complants that they have been denied justice and will be a further cause of excitement.Unrest will be further increased when collective punishments are inflicted on villages found guilty of looting. It is reported that passive resistance will be offered to sentences, so that fines may have to be collected by force. There is also probability of disturbance on the 2nd November, anniversary of Balfour Declaration. In conclusion, I would point out that if there is another outbreak it would be more formidable than the last, for the Arabs have recently obtained a considerable number of arms from Trans-Jordan and Hedjaz, and support from Arabs across the border would almost certainly be forthcoming. Taking all these circumstances into considera-tion I and my civil advisers are of the opinion that troops in Palestine cannot at present prudently be reduced below three battalions. I have discussed the position with the Air Vice-Marshal; he has suggested, in order to meet the wishes of the War Office, that the Green HoAvards should return to Egypt and a battalion should be brought from Malta as soon as possible to relieve them. As I see no likelihood even after present crisis of it being possible to reduce British troops below two battalions, this arrangement should not involve heavy expenditure, because as soon as situation admits of reduction to two battalions the South Wales Borderers could return to Egypt.&quot;(4.) High Commissioners Telegram No. 264 of October 19.&quot; In opinion of competent observers, situation in Palestine is for the first time since outbreaks were suppressed definitely dangerous. The Moslem population appear to be approaching a state of desperation on account of Governments failure to meet their wishes in any Avay. This feeling is not confined to the leaders only, but has spread to the lower classes and to the rural population.It requires only the smallest incident to provoke, an outbreak on the part of the Arab population, and if such an outbreak should occur it Aviil probably not be confined to Palestine itself, but will spread to neighbouring countries. I have just been informed by French Consul-General that there were disturbances in connection with Wailing Wall regulations in Beirut and Damascus yesterday.One of the chief factors enabling the ill-disposed to keep public opinion inflamed and causing perturbation among the. ignorant Arab masses is delay in settling the Wailing Wall question.&quot;
282B.(1.) M. Ballereau, an official of the French Foreign Office and late French Consul at Jerusalem, in conversation with the High Commissioner on the 13th September, expressed the opinion that only the presence of British troops ill considerable force had prevented the renewal of outbreaks, and expressed the earnest hope that there would be no reduction of the force theii available.(2.) High Commissioner&apos;s Despatch Secret (a) of October 24, 1929.Report of conversation with M. Ponsot, French High Commissioner for Syria. Extract from summary of what M. Ponsot said : &quot;When the Commission of Enquiry issued their report, His Majesty&apos;s Government must make a declaration of policy that was less unyielding to the Arab demands than they had hitherto done, otherwise further outbreaks were inevitable; but that would not be easy because the Jews were very powerful and could bring influence to bear on many questions.&quot;(3.)

The Grand Mufti reported to have considered this unnecessarv t present.(5.)

In the course of the debate some members spoke openly in favour of revolution : That a general rising is the only means to save the country is common talk among all classes of the population; also that the people have become desperate and unmindful of risks; further, villages are stated to have become affected by political propaganda and by the economic depression, influenced by purchase of lands by Jews and resultant ejection of Arab farmers.&quot;(5.) High Commissioners Telegram No. 265 of October 19.&quot; In view of information given in my telegram No. 264, 19th October, I must deprecate in the strongest manner the withdrawal of the third battalion. Open weakening of the garrison is sure to encourage the ill-disposed, and at the present time ia imprudent to the highest degree.&quot;(6.) Extract from Demi-Official Letter from High Commissioner to Sir J. Shuckburqhof October 18.&quot; I hope that the Arabs will remain quiet during the inquiry; but I am quite certain of this, that unless, as the result of the inquiry of the Commission, they obtain some concessions and the ambitions of the Zionists are curbed, there will be a rebellion.That is the opinion of the people who know the country best.&quot;
(6.) Police Report for Week Ending October 19.&quot;It is rumoured in Safad that 400 men selected to form an armed force-money being collected for purchase of arms by the ex-Mayor of Safad, 350 said to have been already enrolled : object reprisals against Jews in the event of death sentences or long terms of imprisonment.&quot;(Note. Situation report, 15th November, reports sniping at Safad.)(7.) Police Report for Week Ending October 26.In connection with Safad sentences. Gangs of criminals to attack Jews and British officials have been formed and will first function in areas at Haifa and Nablus. Rumours are current in Nablus that a band of over 150 robbers from Safad and Syria and Jebel Druse are concentrating near Syria Frontier to attack Jews. There are other rumours that the Arab Executive is arranging to form gangs in each town and village, and that Sultan El Atrash will attack Safad.(8.) Secret memorandum from O.C., Arab Legion (Trans-Jordan), to British Resident at Amman (Trans-Jordan), the 28th September, reporting a recent meeting of Sheikhs, who appear to have (a) discussed the possibility of marching armed force into Palestine : not agreedto but arranged that in event of another outbreak Trans-Jordan Arabs should join en masse.(b) decided to postpone question of forming bands of brigands to enterPalestine until advice of Syria and Palestine had been taken.(c) unanimously decided to raise money to buy arms and ammunition forPalestine.Lieutenant-Colonel Peake&apos;s conclusion is that no overt act of large scale aggres-sion against Palestine is to be expected unless disorders break out again. Outbreak of armed brigandage is to be expected.(9.) Intelligence summary of the 10th October from Trans-Jordan Frontier Force: 1. It is reported that approximately 50 rifles and a quantity of ammunition were taken into Safad from Kuneitra during the previous week, and that officials of the Syrian Government were paid to assist in safeguarding the transhipment of the consignment.This is the second occasion in the last four weeks that arms have been imported into Safad.2. It is further reported that about 18 camel loads of tombac, arrak, arms and ammunition entered Palestine from the Jericho area, and that the smugglers were 12 men of Abu Diss Village, assisted by two of the Customs Officials at the Allenby Bridge, with 18 Bedu or the Adwans with some Syrians.According to reports, the camels proceeded to a point in the hills 7 miles from Jericho, where the arms, &amp;e, were hidden for three days in a cave.The Arrak, with some tombac was then sent to Ramallah and Tulkarem Areas.The arms, ammunition and the rest of the tombac was sent to Hebron and Beersheba Areas by way of the Nebi Musa Mosque-Khadr-and Beit Sahor to Hebron.This consignment was hidden in the vineyards and afterwards part of it was unloaded in Hebron, the remainder being sent to Beersheba District.3. A band of well-armed men was formed in Safad last week, and took to the country with the object of attacking Jews.It is stated that this is one of many similar bands which will be formed in the near future for the same purpose.It is thought that larger bands will be formed in the Beersheba Area.
Experienced bandits are being consulted as to the best means of carrying out guerilla warfare, which may commence after the Corn-mission from London arrives and completes its report.Committees are being formed in many parts of Palestine for the purpose of helping these bands.4. It is understood that arms are not at present being sent from Amman and Es Salt, the areas operated being Hule and Tiberias in the North and to Wadi Muso in the South.5. The tribes of Bashanti and Sukhr have formed an alliance for participation in action when it takes place.The tribes of Hanadi have not joined them, and insist on remaining neutral.   The Arabs are in Beisan-Ajluh Areas.6. It is believed that whilst Arabs are active in persuading the public to remain quiet throughout the country until the decision of the British Govern-ment is known, preparations are being made all over Palestine for a general uprising, well-armed and organised for action, against the Jews if the Jews commit further actions against the Arabs.7. It is understood that in the event of any action by the Jews for which they can be regarded as legally responsible, the Arab Communities will not hesitate to attack them by all means at their disposal, and at whatever cost.(10.) Report by Commandant of Police of General Assembly of Arab Congress at Jerusalem the 27th October, called by the Executive, at which delegates, including. Bedouin Sheikhs from all parts of Palestine were present, and some representatives, from Trans-Jordan, but no tribal Sheikhs. Great enthusiasm and determination to &quot; save the country,&quot; even at the cost of their lives, was manifested. Judging from the attitude of the Assembly, it was apparent that the people were in a state of extreme excitement that approximated to a revolutionary disposition. It is said that the Arabs now await the &quot;decision&quot; of the Commission, and if these are unsatisfactory the only course open to them -is a- general uprising. They are in a state of despair, and openly accuse the Government and state that life is becoming unbearable. It is felt that any further step taken by the Jews or the Government which is likely to give offence to the Arabs would lead to an outbreak. The leasts spark is sufficient to set the country in flames. It should, however, be added that reference is made in the report to the presence of moderating influences.(11.) Report of British Resident, Trans-Jordan, on the political situation.The people have been persuaded to believe ill of the English during the recent election campaign when the question of religion was not made use of, and it is obvious that this incipient distrust can easily be turned into hatred if the people are told that the British are arranging that their Holy Places be given to the Jews.A definite step in this direction was taken by the Arab Executive in their recent telegram regarding the Wailing Wall when they declared that the Government had turned it into a synagogue.The Arab Executive appears to have aroused the sympathy of the Moslem World and will, I imagine, do their utmost to the end that this opportunity of ridding Palestine of the Balfour Declaration shall not escape them.Trans-Jordan was kept out of the riots in August because the Palestine problem was not to the fore in the minds of the people and because a plan of action had not been prepared. Should a further outburst against the Jews be arranged, I fear the country might not behave so well.C.Other Reports as to Arab Activities.(1.) Mr. Ketchum&apos;s report in &quot;Daily Express&quot; of the 2nd September. This was referred to the High Commissioner in the following telegram : &quot; &apos; Daily Express &apos; to-day contains report of alleged statement by Grand Mufti to special correspondent Ketchum, from which following are extracts :-&apos; This is a serious national revolution, the reverberations of which may soon be heard in every corner of Moslem Arabia.  We are faced at this moment[20327] c
with, a grave national rebellion, in which we have the sympathy, and, if need be, should &quot;have the support, not only of the Moslem Arabs of Syria and Egypt and North Africa, but of the whole of Arabia with its sixty millions of people &apos;;and&apos; Ultimate peace in Palestine and Arabia will never be made while Great Britain continues to pursue the policy of the Balfour declaration.&apos; &quot;On enquiry being made, the Grand Mufti denied the authenticity of the account; but Mr. Ketchum persisted, confirming his statement with some written evidence of its accuracy.(2.) Intercepted letters between Haj Amin (the Grand Mufti) and Central Khalifat Committee, Bombay; and also a report from a reasonably reliable source that the Grand Mufti offered his services to the King of Egypt in furtherance of the latter&apos;s ambitions in respect of Khalifat, saying that Palestine was the one place under British rule where Moslems could without difficulty carry out anti-British agitation.(3.) An eminent Jewish source has mentioned Ahmad Zeki Pasha (of Egypt) as intriguing Avith the Grand Mufti. No confirmation has been received, but it appears that he been associated with various intrigues and had dealings Avith the Riffi and Avith Gordon Canning, whom the High Commissioner wished to exclude from Palestine, but subsequently admitted on his giving &quot;satisfactory&apos;&apos; explanations, but who has been very active since his arrival, and whose presence is regarded with suspicion by the French. It may be mentioned here that in a recent telegram to the Prime Minister, Canning said : &quot; Hope can keep peace a Avhile; after that only force of arms.&quot;(4.) Report of Confidential Interview on September 29 between Mr. Luke and Mum Kazim Pasha (President of the Arab Executive in Palestine).Musa Kazim said that if the report of the Commission did not result directly or indirectly in restatement of Jewish National Home policy giving relief to Arab anxiety there would be an armed rising, which in his opinion and that of the Arabs generally would involve participation of Moslems from Syria, Trans-Jordan and perhaps Iraq. He also said that any executions of Arabs Avould be deeply resented.(5.) Several messages received from His Majesty&apos;s representative in Mexico as to a shipment of arms from and collection of funds in Mexico for use by Arabs in Palestine. It is stated that depots for storage of arms exist at three centres (one of which, Kuneitra, is mentioned independently at B 9). Nablus is also referred to.  Other details as to supposed preparations are given.(6.) In an official letter of the 5th November from the Zionist Organisation to the Colonial Office, pressing for re-establishment of sealed armouries for jewish Colonies, the Zionist Organisation emphasised the urgency of the matter on the ground that during the rainy season Colonies would be much less accessible to troops, while the tension between the Jewish and Arab population continues and is not likely to abate as long as the trials and the Avork of the Enquiry Commission are in progress.D.Secret Intelligence Reports.(1.) A secret intelligence report dated the 13th November from a source in close touch with Palestinian Arab nationalists, which has proved reliable in the past, states that a secret Committee called the Boycott Committee has been formed for terrorist purposes with a view to the assassination of persons considered to be acting against Arab nationalist interests. After one warning, anyone who continues his activities to be killed by members selected by the Committee. Said to have been formed with knowledge and consent of Supreme Moslem Council and Arab Executive who have subscribed to expense. One man accused of making Arabs sign petitions in favour of Jews was assassinated 21st October. After meeting of the 17th October, warning was sent to Judge Litt and other Avarnings decided upon at Committee
284E.The Arab press continues to be very inflammatory, in particular a paper which is now for the first time published in English. There is pressure for an extension of the terms of reference of the Commission of Enquiry so as to enable it to investigate the &quot;true&quot; cause of previous and recent outbreaks as well as the &quot;immediate&quot; causes.   Otherwise, it is argued, further disturbances are inevitable.F.As an instance of a warning falsified by the event, it may be worth mentioning that a Jewish settler in Palestine named Mr. Kurt Levy called at the Colonial Office on the eve of the 2nd November (Balfour Declaration Day) urging that an immediate announcement should be issued calling a joint conference of Arabs and Jews in conciliatory terms on the express condition that the Arabs kept quiet on the 2nd November. Mr. Levy said that he was convinced that unless some such step was taken a further general disturbance was certain to occur. As a matter of fact, beyond a strike and general closing of shops, this critical day passed off quietly.Colonial Office, November 1929.meeting 19th October. A later report, also from a secret intelligence source, gives further details concerning the &quot;Boycott Committee.&quot; It consists of 24 persons, eleven of whom are stated to be members of the Palestinian Communist Party. It appears to have organised its murder campaign quite effectively. In this connexion it may be mentioned that, in a recent demi-official letter, Sir J. Chancellor reported as a disquieting feature of the situation, that the (Arab) sources of information hitherto available to the police in Palestine had almost completely &quot;dried up&quot; This may be an indication that the terrorist policy of the &quot; Boycott Committee &quot; is meeting with some success.(2.) Another report of same date indicates that the Wafd in Egypt has been in correspondence through Mustapha Nahas with the Grand Mufti and the President of the Arab Executive, encouraging their resistance to the British Government and promising moral and financial assistance. Similar support has been promised by other members of Wafd. Nahas has been urged by the Indian Khalifat Committee to help the Palestine Arabs in their struggle against British Imperialism He replied on the 24th October that Wafd were doing all they could to assist Palestinians but would be m a better position to help after they had assumed power.
