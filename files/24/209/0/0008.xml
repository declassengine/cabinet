THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1930.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.     35CP. 8 (30).ANGLO-PERSIAN  NEGOTIATIONS.[E 36/36/34]Suggested Sale to Persia by Great Britain of Patrol Vessels for Anti-Contraband Work in the Persian Gulf and proposed British Naval Mission for Persia.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum on the above question, which has arisen in the course of the negotiations at present proceeding with the Persian Government.This document embodies the result of full discussion by the various Government Offices concerned, and I trust that the general views and course of action suggested therein will meet with the approval of my colleagues.A. H.Foreign Office, January 8, 1930.Memorandum.NEGOTIATIONS have for some months been in progress for a general treaty settlement with Persia, as it is desirable that our relations with that country should be established on a satisfactory and permanent basis by the settlement as soon as possible of various difficult questions.2. The present moment is a favourable one for such a settlement. Teymourtache, the Persian Minister of Court, is at present a powerful factor in the sphere of foreign relations, and possessing more experience of the outside world than most Persian statesmen, he is for that very reason a more astute negotiator. But he is also prepared to accept greater responsibility, and exercises greater personal influence with the Shah, than is likely to be the case with any successor.3. As a part of the proposed settlement, we are asking Persia for facilities for our ships&apos; companies to land for recreation at Henjarn. We are asking her to renounce her claims (which we regard as without foundation) to certain Arabian islands in the Persian Gulf, and to repay the capital of her pre-war debt, on which she has hitherto paid only interest. These British requirements are reasonable, but, on paper, they mean a series of apparent concessions by Persia. In return for them we are prepared to offer certain important financial concessions (see para-graph 12 below); but the negotiations may none the less be not easy, and any further concession, real or even apparent, which we can make on our side, would enable the Persian Government to save face an important factor in all negotiations with an Eastern Power.4. On the 20th August the Persian Minister of Court made an important suggestion to Sir R. Clive, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tehran. He explained that Persia desired to develop her own control over the contraband trade, &amp;c, in the Persian Gulf, and wished to appeal to Great- Britain for assistance in the form of a small fleet of armed patrol vessels (four of 1,000 and six of 200 tons). He added that what he, personally, would like would be for British naval officers to command these vessels, and for His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept a number of Persian cadets for training in England. Persia had been negotiating for the supply of such ships from Italy, and had, in fact, already sent twenty young Persians for training in an Italian naval school at Leghorn; but she would much prefer to obtain the assistance she needed from Great Britain, who alone, he explained, &quot;with her5189   [20393]
outstanding knowledge of. the Persian Gulf, and the finest naval service in the world,&quot; could effectively help Persia to put down the contraband trade in this area.5. In putting forward this proposal, Teymourtache attempted to link it on to the entirely separate question of Bahrein. Persia recently revived an ancient claim to the ownership of the Arab islands of Bahrein, off the Arabian coast of the Gulf, with the independent rulers, of which His Majesty&apos;s Government have been in special treaty relations for more than a century. Teymourtache has provisionally agreed to abandon this claim in the general treaty now under negotiation, but still maintains that Persia is entitled to demand compensation for doing so. He has suggested that the ships referred to above should be supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Government as a free gift, as a part of the return to be made for the abandonment of the claim to Bahrein. This cannot, of course, be entertained, as Sir R. Clive at once pointed out. There could not well be any question of our making a particular concession to Persia as a specific return for her abandonment of her Bahrein claim, or of our supplying the ships as a free gift.6.   Two separate questions present themselves for consideration : (a.) Is it desirable, on general political grounds, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make an effort to assist the Persian Government to obtain the patrol vessels from British sources, lend the officers, &amp;c. ?(&amp;.) If so, can the financial difficulties, arising from the fact that a free gift of these vessels to Persia is out of the question, be in any way surmounted %7. There are strong reasons for considering it desirable that, if the Persian Government really mean in some way or another to acquire these patrol vessels, they should be encouraged to obtain them from British sources. These reasons may be summarised as follows : (a.) By meeting Teymourtache half-way in his present proposals, our position in the general negotiations will be strengthened, whereas a refusal to consider his proposals would be likely to render these negotiations even more difficult than they are at present. ... (b.) We should show that we were ready to co-operate with the Persians in their legitimate object of attempting themselves to police their waters, to control smuggling, and to fulfil their international responsibilities in connexion with the suppression of the arms traffic and the slave trade in the Persian Gulf, (c.) We should help the British shipbuilding trade.(d.) If Persia obtains her ships from other sources, she will probably obtain from those same sources the officers to command the ships. If, on the other hand, she obtains her ships from British sources, it is likely (as is shown by Teymourtache&apos;s personal suggestion mentioned in paragraph 4 above) that the ships will be commanded by British officers; and if the ships were commanded by British officers : (1.) The Persian preventive service would be better managed than if we did not co-operate in its development. Moreover, the ships, by enabling Persia to make some positive contribution to the control of the slave trade and the arms traffic, might to some extent relieve His Majesty&apos;s ships of the liabilities which they at present discharge in those matters, owing to Persian inability to do so.(2.) From a different standpoint, the presence of British personnel should go far to reduce the danger of the employment of the Persian naval force, as might otherwise be the case, to harass the Arab chiefs on the Arabian coast of the Gulf, with Avhom His Majesty&apos;s Government are in close treaty relations, or of its being allowed to act in an arbitrary or unjust manner.(3.) We should avoid risk of other European PoAvers obtaining a footing in the Gulf astride our air and sea communications with the East.8. The local British authorities in the Gulf are strongly of opinion that it is preferable for Persia to acquire her naval patrol service under British auspices as a British training should give the Persian personnel a British outlook, and this tendency would be accentuated by the presence in the Gulf of His Majesty&apos;s ships, which will act as a model.   Such experience amongst the Persian personnel should
44go far to establish &apos; really good Anglo-Persian relations locally, whereas if the personnel were trained under Italian or other auspices, it is to be feared that not only the relations between Persians and British, but between Persians and Arabs, and even between British and Arabs would inevitably be exacerbated.9. The Government of India are similarly in favour of the proposal. They consider it desirable to keep Italy and other Powers out of the Gulf; and if this can only be done by our providing ships and personnel, they think that we should do so. They suggest, however, that the Persian naval forces be kept as small as possible.10. The Admiralty would be prepared to assist in finding British personnel, provided that the Persian Government offer suitable terms.11. The second question is whether it is possible to overcome the financial difficulties arising from the fact that a free gift of these vessels to Persia is out of the question. But Sir P. Clive has suggested that this might be done by linking this question on to that of the possible remission of part of the Persian debt to this country.12. The total capital debt of Persia to this country and India amounts approximately to  3-g million; and, with accumulated interest, the amount would be in the neighbourhood of  5 million. As a result of negotiations with a former Persian Prime Minister, however, we offered in the year 1925 to reduce the total of the debt to the round sum of  2 million, to be paid off by means of a twenty-five years&apos; annuity, to start in 1926. This offer was accepted by the Persian Government subject to approval by the Majlis, but in fact has never been submitted to that body for ratification. Of the total  2 million a sum of  490,000 represents the Persian pre-war debt, on which interest has always been paid, and the remainder represents debt contracted during and since the war. As regards this latter part of the debt, the Persians are understood to contend that no obligation rests on them to repay any part of the debt contracted during and after the war at a time when British troops were occupying their country. They argue that the debts were illegally incurred without the sanction of the Persian Parliament, and that the money was spent primarily for the benefit of the Allies, and ought to be regarded as British war expenditure. This is a point of view which could not possibly be accepted by &apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government; but as a matter of practical politics it is probable that no treaty settlement with this country would be accepted or ratified by Persia which provided for the repayment of the war or post-war debt. It was accordingly agreed in December 1928 that His Majesty&apos;s Government would, if necessary, be prepared to waive this part of the debt in return for a satisfactory general settlement of other outstanding questions, and on the understanding that suitable arrangements would be made for the repayment of the capital of the pre-war debt, on which interest only has been paid till now.  Nothing has as yet been said to the Persians on the subject.13. The cost of the ships indicated by Teymourtache (four of 1,000 and six of 200 tons) would differ widely according to the type selected, but may provisionally be put in the neighbourhood of  500,000. With a view to giving effect to the wish of the Government of India that the Persian naval forces should be on the smallest possible scale, the senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf has submitted that two sloops of 600-700 tons and four motor:launches of 150-200&apos; tons would be sufficient, with the existing customs motor dhows, to deal with the contraband trade. The capital cost of this proposal he estimates at roughly  140,000.14. It has been suggested that Sir R. Clive should begin by offering the Persians the remission of  1 million only of the war and post-war debt, insisting on the repayment of the balance of  510,000. In the last resort, however, and in order to meet the difficulty, alluded to above, of obtaining Persian ratifications of any settlement providing for the repayment of any part of this debt, Sir R. Clive might be authorised to waive the last  510,000 of the war and post-war debt, on condition that Persia undertakes to purchase her naval requirements in British shipyards, and to sign an agreement for the supply of the ships which she desires from this country. This is, however, only a tentative suggestion which may prove impracticable, and some other means of overcoming the financial difficulty may have to be devised.15. To sum up, it seems clearly desirable on general political grounds that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make an effort to meet the request which has
recently been put forward by the&apos; Persian Minister of Court for British assist 11 -rfi.formatl(?n of a sma11 fleet of Persian patrol vessels. It is realised, however that there can be no question of making any further financial concessions to Persia&apos; that the pre-requisite of any arrangement regarding the ships must be the settlement of the pre-war debt; and that it can therefore only be by some such arrangement as that suggested in the preceding paragraph, by which the ships should be actually paid tor by Persia, that the Persian proposal could be met. It is therefore proposed to send to bir .R. Clive general instructions on these lines, and to authorise him to proceed as suggested in the preceding paragraph.o
