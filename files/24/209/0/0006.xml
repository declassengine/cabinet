THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   January 193U.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.       34cp. 6 (30).CABINET.MEMORANDUM ON CHINA.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues an exhaustive and admirable statement, both of the present position in China and of the policy we are pursuing to meet the requirements of the situation there.2. It will be seen that our policy is one of gradual and progressive revision of treaties by friendly negotiation with the Chinese, and after consultation in matters of joint interest with other Powers concerned; and that it is based on the memorandum of the 18th December, 1926, and the treaty revision offer of the following January, which were made when our predecessors were in office and which received on several occasions (see, for instance, Mr. MacDonald&apos;s support of the relevant paragraphs in the King&apos;s Speech on the 7th February, 1928) the approval of the Labour party.3. It will be seen that -considerable progress has been made along the lines of the policy then declared, notably in the following matters : (1.) Return to Chinese administration of the British concessions at Hankow,Kiukiang and Chinkiang. (2.) Reform of the constitution of the British concession at Tientsin, placingBritish and Chinese upon an  absolutely&quot; equal footing as regardsfranchise and representation on the council. (3.) Admission  of  greater  Chinese representation on the council of theInternational Settlement at Shanghai. . (4.) Freeing the customs revenue from foreign control and restoring the CustomsAdministration to its former position as the servant instead of the master of the Chinese Government. (5.) Recognition of China&apos;s right to tariff autonomv in the treaty of the20th December, 1928. (6.) Recognition of modern Chinese law courts as the competent courts for casesbrought by British plaintiffs or complainants without attendance of aBritish representative. (7.) Modification of special treaty privileges possessed by British missionaries. (8.) Considerable reduction of the Shanghai Defence Force.4.   Questions still outstanding are the following :  (1.) Extra-territoriality.(2.) Final withdrawal of the Shanghai Defence Force.(3.) Negotiation of a new commercial treaty.(4.) Rendition of Weihaiwei.(5.) Settlement of Boxer indemnity question.(6.) Recognition of a reasonable Chinese Nationality Law.(7.) Settlement of the question of the payment of regular and legal Chinesetaxation by British subjects.&apos; (8.) Future of the two small British concessions at Canton and Amoy. (9.) Future government of the International Settlement at Shanghai, as regardswhich the most immediate problem is that of the status, powers, andcontrol of the Provisional Court.&apos;5. As regards the first two of these still unsettled questions, viz., extra-territoriality and the final withdrawal of the Shanghai Defence Force, I ask for the special consideration of my colleagues. I am prepared to go a considerable way in the surrender of extra-territorial rights in civil matters in return for certain safeguards, probably in the employment of foreign judges in the Chinese courts, but5157 * [20324] b
i am not prepared as yet to surrender our extra-territorial rights in criminal cases, except perhaps in regard to such minor matters as breaches of municipal regulations and police offences. The mandate issued by the Chinese Government on the 28th December, providing for the observance of Chinese laws by all foreign nationals as from the 1st January, was so worded as to leave the door open for negotiations and for the continuance of extra-territorial privileges for the present, and the Chinese Minister has expressly confirmed the fact that this is the intention. i have therefore decided that it is unnecessary to protest against it or to refuse to negotiate, and negotiations are accordingly now being started. As regards the withdrawal of our troops from Shanghai, I share the view expressed in the memorandum that such action would for the moment be untimely, having regard to the general political situation in China and the fact that our extra-territoriality negotiations are not yet concluded. There is much to support the view that withdrawal now would almost inevitably be interpreted by the Chinese as a sign of weakness with the result that they would be disposed to yet further increase their demands.6. As regards Weihaiwei, I am proposing that the Chinese Government, if they are intent on eliminating all British interests in the territory, should provide His Majesty&apos;s Admiralty with the facilities they require at some other port, and that they should buy out the foreign property owners. The Boxer indemnity question can, I trust, be settled by the Chinese Government investing the whole or greater part of the funds in the purchase of railway material in this country; this would, at the same time, assist China in the rehabilitation of her railways and also help to deal with the unemployment question in this country; the investment would eventually form an endowment for educational purposes; it is on this line that I have just issued instructions to Sir M. Lampson. The question of the Chinese Nationality Law principally concerns those Anglo-Chinese who have a title or claim to British nationality and protection through the accident of their birth in Hong Kong or British Malaya; they have thus a dual nationality and are both British and Chinese; Sir M. Lampson has been instructed at length on this long-standing question; our solution is, roughly, that such persons shall not be entitled to British protection when in China. A formal settlement of the question of payment of taxation will probably have to await the negotiation of a commercial treaty. Until then the enforcement of such taxation will not be regularised through the British courts in China, but British merchants are being advised that it is in their own interest to pay such taxes under protest so long as they are not discriminatory or unreasonably oppressive. Our two concessions at Canton and Amoy can be returned to the Chinese as soon as they desire on similar terms to those of the rendition of Kiukiang and Chinkiang; but so far the Chinese have shown no interest in this matter. The question of the Provisional Court at Shanghai is now under negotiation with the Chinese, and a commission, including representatives of China and of the foreign Powers interested, is now sitting to examine the question. This is the most urgent question as regards Shanghai, and it is a difficult problem. There are others, such as increased Chinese representation on the Municipal Council, control and policing of extra-settlement roads, &amp;c, which it will be better to deal with point by point as they arise. Any wholesale academic scheme for dealing with the future of Shanghai is likely to prove impracticable.7. In view of the great importance of the British interests involved in the China problem and of the fact that I have not since my accession to office circulated any statement on the position to my colleagues, I have deemed it advisable to cause the attached memorandum to be prepared. Perhaps I may point out that the policy which I am pursuing is in accordance with the declaration of December 1926, which was endorsed at the time by the Prime Minister. The main objective which I have in view is the liquidation of those obligations which are now out of date and which have become a burden rather than an advantage to us, but progress must necessarily be gradual and can only be made pari passu with the efforts of the Chinese to raise the standards of government and administration in their country to a level more nearly comparable with our own. The volume and intricacy of our trade relations with China are such that any sudden change would be liable to create disorder both in the political and economic sphere.A. H.Foreign Office, January 8, 1930.
CONFIDENTIAL.BRITISH POLICY IN  CHINA.january 1930.Historical Survey.IT is important to bear in mind from the outset that our position in China was originally built up on force. It was maintained up to the Great War on prestige, but the Chinese have now come to realise that unless there is force behind it mere prestige is another word for bluff.For forty years up to 1900 there was much ill-suppressed hatred and suspicion of foreigners, occasionally flaring up into outbreaks of violence. After the war of 1895, when China was decisively defeated by Japan, there was a general belief that China was about to break up, and the Powers, after the manner of those days, made ready to scramble for the pieces, and, as a preliminary step, attempted to divide up the country into spheres of influence. From 1895 to 1900 is the period of spheres of influence and the battle of the concessions, ending in the Boxer outbreak of 1900, when China made a desperate attempt to drive the hatred foreigner from her shores. For this she was severely punished, but after 1900 we enter upon a new era. China accepted the foreigner as inevitable, and, instead of trying to drive him out, set herself to learn from him and discover the secret of his strength. Her immemorial system of State examinations in the Confucian classics was abolished, and a new system of State education on Western lines was instituted- a break with the past, the significance of which it is difficult to exaggerate.The main feature of this new era was that the old blind hatred of the foreigner began to vanish completely, and gave place to a spirit of nationalism which combined great personal friendliness for the foreigner and eagerness to profit by intercourse with him, with a growing feeling of resentment (which surer knowledge only made more bitter) at the injustice of the privileges enjoyed by foreigners and of the restraints imposed on Chinese sovereignty.If we look back into the history of China we shall find that she has passed through many political convulsions, especially when changes of dynasty have taken place, which have threatened her with disintegration. In the end, however, the centripetal forces have prevailed over those of disruption, so that she has always succeeded in reuniting herself. The revolution of 1911 is, however, a greater epoch-making event than any of its predecessors, in that it marks a far more abrupt and complete break with the traditions of the past. From being the oldest absolute monarchy in the world, China suddenly transformed herself into a modern and up-to-date republic, at any rate in theory. This transition was far too abrupt and far too drastic for a people who, by tradition, temperament and political education are so little capable of adapting themselves readily to a new order of things. Of all Constitutions, that of a modern republic presupposes a level of political education among the masses far higher than China yet possesses.For the first five years of the republic its destinies were bound up in the dominating personality of Yuan Shih-kai. So long as the reins of government were in the hands of this sagacious statesman the spirit of the old dispensation was maintained while adhering to the forms of the new, and it seemed as if China might weather the storm. The most significant change was that, in the provinces power insensibly passed from the Civil Governors (the successors of the Viceroys of Manchu days) into the hands of military leaders known as Tuchuns. So long as Yuan Shih-kai lived, he was able to keep the Tuchuns in check; indeed, they were his personal satellites; but with his death in 1916 the keystone of the political arch disappeared, and rivalry at once broke out among them. With it began the struggle for the supreme power in the State, which has lasted ever since, and has plunged the country into a state of almost incessant civil war.The Tuchuns maintained vast armies it is estimated that even now there are at least 1,500,000 men under arms the upkeep of which has tended to absorb every[20324] b 2
available item of revenue, leaving insufficient either for essential provincial services or for the maintenance of the Central Government. China was torn by internecine strife and overrun by brigands. There were said to be about 1 million brigands, and the distinction between brigand and soldier is frequently apt to disappear. Since the death of Yuan Shih-kai, Government succeeded Government at Peking, and their authority often hardly extended beyond the walls of the capital. One and all were impotent, utterly discredited and always on the verge of bankruptcy. One and all were nothing more than a faction in office, a mere shadow, quite unrepresentative of China as a whole. It is a curious fact, however, that the normal life of China should go on unperturbed in spite of all this political turmoil, which only resembles a ripple on the ocean. In many directions China has made solid and substantial progress, and the latest customs returns are a record of continual and steady increase in both revenue and trade.The dominant factor in the present situation has been the success of the Nationalist movement. This owes its success to the new educational impetus which began after 1900, and to the influence of Chinese students educated in Europe and America. The principal leader of this movement was Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who died in 1925, and is now venerated with quasi-divine honours by the party which is in power at Nanking. That party has been known since 1911 as the Kuomintang&apos;. It formed the largest and most vociferous group in the first Chinese Parliament, which was dissolved by Yuan Shi-kai in 1914. After Yuan&apos;s death it continued the feud with the Tuchuns, who were his successors, and from the 1st January, 1918, started a Secessionist Republican Government at Canton, which, although barely in command of the city area, claimed to be the Government of the whole of China. The period of the two Governments (Peking and Canton) lasted from 1918 to 1928. As the Diplomatic Body at Peking recognised the Northern Government only, and as the foreign Powers, notably Great Britain, intervened on several occasions to compel Canton to remit customs revenue to the Peking authorities, the Kuomintang came to regard the foreign Powers, and especially Great Britain, as its enemies, and in 1923 Dr. Sun Yat-sen, after a series of interviews at Shanghai with Dr. Joffe, agreed to accept Russian advisers and assistance for the Kuomintang party and the Canton Government. This alliance further envenomed the Kuomintang against Great Britain, especially after the Shanghai and Shakee &quot; incidents &quot;of 1925. In 1926 the northern expedition of the Cantonese armies began. It was unexpectedly successful. It reached Hankow in September and Shanghai in the following March. Party dissensions (over the Russian and Communist question) then delayed immediate advance, but on the 8th June, 1928, Peking was taken not by the original Cantonese army, but by troops of Yen Hsi-shan, Tuchun of Shansi, who had declared for the Kuomintang side. On the 3rd October the Government Organisation Law was promulgated, and on the 10th October the new National Government was formed at Nanking. By the end of the year Manchuria had declared its adherence to Nanking.   China was nominally united.Nominally because in fact the new Government at Nanking only controls the two or three provinces around the new capital. Elsewhere, local military leaders, though they no longer call themselves Tuchuns, are, in fact, a law to themselves; and Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the National Government of the Republic of China, is himself a Tuchun, watching his brother Tuchuns with a suspicious and malevolent eye.After a year m.office the new Government has not yet found means to reduce the numbers of men under arms or to cope with the menace of brigandage. This, in turn, has made impossible anv rehabilitation of the country&apos;s finances, which continue in a state of disreputable chaos. The new customs tariff has opened up fresh sources of revenue, but the only use to which these have been put is to provide security for the piling up of fresh mountains of debt. The Nationalists have raised more, money by. domestic loans in, two years than the Peking Government did in the previous fourteen, and they display the same tendency to take care of the domestic creditor while . completely ignoring foreign obligations. This, and the recent recrudescence of civil war-though so far it is a war of intrigue rather than actual fighting-are the most disquieting features of the situation. Yet it would be unfair and misleading to assert that the advent of the Nationalists has made no difference to China. It has made a very great difference. In foreign affairs it has enabled China to speak with a tone of authority and to obtain concrete results from powerful and reluctant countries. In internal affairs it has planted the first and microscopic seedof the. science of government according to Western standards.
British Policy Compared ivith that of other Powers.As regards the principles of British policy in China, these can be stated in a very few words. We have no territorial or imperialistic aims. Our first concern is to maintain our position in the trade of China, which is largely bound up with the prosperity of Hong Kong and the fortunes of the Maritime Customs Administration, and to secure adequate protection for British&apos; lives, property and business enter-prises. Our second concern is to maintain the principle of the &quot; open door &quot; and equal opportunity for all and to see that China does not fall under the tutelage of any single Power. For these reasons we desire to see a united, well-ordered, prosperous and peaceful China, and it is our policy to endeavour to co-operate to that end with the other Great Powers concerned. These are the root principles underlying all our efforts in China.We have made some progress away from the days of spheres of influence and the battle of the concessions which preceded the Boxer outbreak, and it is now recognised, at any rate in theory, that co-operation rather than competition should be the guiding principle of the Powers in their dealings with China. The institution of the bankers&apos; consortium in 1913 (for the financing of China&apos;s future foreign loans) was the first step in that direction; its renewal in 1920 and the 1922 Nine-Power Pact of Washington represent further extensions of the principle of international co-operation in China.But notwithstanding the outward show of harmony among the Powers in their relations with China, it has been impossible to ignore the underlying divergence of interests which renders co-operation in practice so difficult. The chief disturbing element in this respect is Japan. There is no gainsaying the fact that Japan, though she may not like chaos in China, does not, for very obvious reasons, want a strong and united China; while, unfortunately. Great Britain and America, though in essentials pursuing the same ends, often do not act in complete harmony owing to a fundamental difference of political outlook. France has considerably less interest in the East than any of the other Great Powers concerned. Her co-operation is&quot; unreliable, and she is prone to use her position to seek her own ends rather than pursue an enlightened policy. A striking and disastrous instance of this was her action in delaying ratification of the Washington Customs Treaty for three years in order to force a settlement of the gold franc controversy a delay which w7as largely responsible for the general deterioration which occurred in the &quot;interval.China and the Powers: The Paris Peace Conference.When China was prevailed upon to declare war against the Central Powers she was promised that the Allied Governments would do all that rested with them to ensure that China should enjoy, in international relations, the position and regard due to a great country. Her delegates at Versailles accordingly pressed upon the Peace Conference the abolition of extra-territoriality and complete tariff autonomy. The situation in China in 1919 was held not to justify these demands, and they were accordingly rejected. This, and her treatment over the Shantung question served greatly to exacerbate Chinese anti-foreign feeling. The Chinese came away from Paris feeling very bitterly that they had been betrayed.A golden opportunity -was thus lost of doing with a good grace and in a serener atmosphere what has since been wrung from us by the force of circumstances, with considerable loss of prestige. From that moment onwards our policy, instead of being one of spontaneous relinquishment of our privileged position, became an enforced retreat, necessitating endless rearguard actions, and in which our main effort is directed towards preventing it from being turned into a rout. The present position of the extra-territoriality question showTs this very clearly.The Washington Conference.The Washington Conference of 1921-22 aimed at remedying many of the grievances which the Powers had by then come to recognise as just. China again pressed for the surrender of extra-territoriality and for tariff autonomy, but although these were not granted, the conference resulted in a very large measure of capitulation to Chinese aspirations. Many of the concessions were no doubt fully justified and overdue.  Nevertheless, the Washington Conference taught the Chinese
how easy it is to manoeuvre the Powers at an international conference into compliance with their demands. Washington produced four international instruments which definitely circumscribe and determine the policy of the Powers in the Far East generally.   They are : 1. The Four-Power Treaty (British Empire, United States of America, Japan and France).By this treaty the contracting parties agreed to respect their rights in relation to their insular possessions and insular dominions in the region of the Pacific Ocean. Any controversies arising out of any specific question not satisfactorily settled by diplomacy are to be submitted for consideration to a joint conference; the contracting Powers are to communicate with one another in the event of aggressive action by any other Power threatening the said rights; the treaty is to be in force for ten years, and thereafter to continue in force, subject to twelve months&apos; notice by any contracting party; upon ratification of the treaty (i.e., the 17th August, 1923) the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Agreement had to terminate. A subsequent treaty (the 6th February, 1922) defined the term &quot; insular possessions and insular dominions&quot; in its application to Japan so as not to include the main islands of Japan.2. The Nine-power  Treaty (British Empire, United States of America, Japan, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal and China).The contracting Powers other than China agreed (1) to respect the sovereignty, the independence and the territorial and administrative integrity of China; (2) to provide the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to China to develop and maintain for herself an effective and stable government; (3) to use then influence ,.for the purpose of effectually establishing and maintaining the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations throughout the territory of China; (4) to refrain from taking advantage of conditions in China in order to seek special rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjects or citizens of friendly States and from countenancing action inimical to the security of such States.They further agreed not to enter into any treaty or agreement contrary to these principles, and that in deference to the principle of the &quot; open door,&quot; or equality of opportunity in China, they would not seek nor support their nationals in seeking : (a) any arrangement which might purport to establish in favour their interests, any general superiority of rights with respect to commercial or economic development in any designated region of China; (&amp;) any such monopoly or preference as would deprive nationals of any other Power of the right of undertaking any legitimate trade or industry in China, or of participating with the Chinese Government or with any local authority in any category of public enterprise which, by reason of its scope, duration or geographical extent, is calculated to frustrate the practical application of the principle of equal opportunity.Other articles of the treaty stipulate : (i) That there will be no attempt by the Powers concerned to create spheres of influence; (ii) that there will be no unfair discrimination on Chinese railways; (iii) that Chinese neutrality in future wars will be respected; (iv) that the Powers concerned will communicate frankly and freely between themselves in any future situation affecting the treaty; (v) that other Powers, having treaty relations with China, shall be invited to adhere to the treaty: (vi) that the treaty shall come into force on the deposit of ratifications (i.e., the 5th August, 1925).   No definite date is fixed for the duration of the treaty.3. The China Customs Treaty (same signatories as No. 2).This treaty promised China an additional 1\ per cent, increase on her tariff, conditionally, and it provided that a special conference should meet to determine on what conditions the increase should be granted.4. A Resolution Respecting Extra-territoriality.This provided that a commission should be established to enquire into the whole question of extra-territorial jurisdiction with a view to its ultimate surrender.
The Extra-territoriality Commission.The commission which was convened in accordance with the Washington Conference resolution, referred to above, was to have met at Peking on. the 18th December, 1925, but, owing to the outbreak of civil war, the first meeting did not take place until the 12th January, 1926. Its report was signed on the 16th September of the same year. It made certain recommendations, and advised that when these recommendations had been reasonably complied with, the Powers would be warranted in relinquishing their extra-territorial rights, in return for freedom of residence and trade and civil rights in all parts of China. The recommendations included the following points : (1.) That the courts be protected against unwarranted interference, civil or military.(2.) That judicial codes, &amp;c, be completed and put into force.(3.) That laws be enacted,&quot; &amp;c, under a uniform system.(4.) That the system of modern courts, prisons, &amp;c, be extended.(5.) That adequate financial provision be made for courts, prisons, &amp;c.(6.) That prior to compliance with the above recommendations, but after the principal items had been carried out, some progressive scheme for abolition of extra-territoriality be considered.(7.) That the extra-territorial powers should make certain modifications in the existing system, e.g. by applying Chinese laws in consular courts, by permitting the trial of cases with foreign plaintiffs before the modern Chinese courts without the presence of a foreign assessor, by checking abuses in extending foreign protection to Chinese persons and companies, by arranging for judicial assistance between the Chinese authorities and the authorities of the extra-territorial Powers, and for prompt execution of judgments, summonses, &amp;c, by insisting that their nationals should pay taxes duly levied by the competent Chinese authorities.The Chinese Commissioner, Dr. Wang Chung-hui, signed the report, but dissociated himself from some of the statements of fact contained therein.The Tariff Conference.The Tariff Conference met at Peking on the 26th October, 1925. Its primary object was to grant to China the promised tariff increases known as the Washington surtaxes, and, if possible, to come to some agreement as to the expenditure of this increased revenue. From the opening of the conference, however, the Chinese delegation (led by Dr. C. T. Wang, who is now Foreign Minister of the National Government at Nanking) concentrated on the question of tariff autonomy, and within three weeks obtained from the foreign delegations their assent to a resolution promising tariff autonomy for China on the 1st January, 1929. This unforeseen development was the only effective outcome of the conference, which continued to meet intermittently until July 1926. Its time was taken up by discussions among the Powers as to the conditions under which the Washington surtaxes might be granted ; discussions which showed little insight into the realities of the situation. Meanwhile, the Peking Government was crumbling, the Nationalist movement from Canton was in full swing, and an intensive boycott was being directed by Canton against Great Britain. As our colleagues at the Peking Conference were inclined to ascribe to us. the responsibility for failure, His Majesty&apos;s Government decided to clear the air by addressing a note to the United States Government (who had pointedly enquired as to our attitude towards the conference), in which we suggested that the Washington surtaxes should be granted unconditionally, and that no attempt should be made to impose, control, or exact guarantees as regards these revenues. In short, the Tariff Conference came to its inconclusive end (1) because of the attitude of certain Powers, notably Japan and the United States, who, in their eagerness to obtain payment of their unsecured debts, were determined to perpetuate as regards the additional revenues the vicious system described at page 17 of this memorandum, by which the customs revenues were impounded under the control of the Inspector-General of Customs for the service of the foreign obligations; and (2) because the course of the civil war made it impossible for the Chinese to present anything like a representative delegation.
Canton Government Levy the Washington Surtaxes.On the 10th October the Nationalist Government at Canton imposed certain consumption duties on imports and exports at rates corresponding in the case of the former to those of the Washington surtaxes. His Majesty&apos;s Government joined in a pro forma protest with the other treaty Powers, but, in view of the fact that we were by now convinced that these surtaxes should be granted unconditionally, we took no further action, and British merchants paid the surtaxes under protest.Being now in possession of a revenue accruing from foreign trade, the Canton Government found that their boycott of Hong Kong was doing them more harm than good. Accordingly, it was called off, and within a few months the activities of the Boycott Committee had virtually ceased. At the same time, the Nationalist armies, assisted by Russian munitions and advice, had advanced in triumph to the Yangtze, and the Nationalist Government removed its seat from Canton to Wuchang (opposite Hankow) in December 1926.The December Memorandum.Faced by tentative proposals for a renewal of the Tariff Conference, His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the 18th December, 1926, communicated their now famous memorandum to the representatives (at Peking) of all the Washington Treaty Powers. This memorandum renews the proposal to grant the Washington surtaxes unconditionally and to free the revenues from all forms of foreign control, but, in view of the success of the Nationalist cause, and also of the fact that the Extra-territoriality Commission had just reported, we went a step forward, and suggested that the commission^ recommendations should be carried into effect, and that &quot; the Powers should make it clear that in their constructive policy they desired to go as far as possible towards meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Chinese nation.&quot;The Offer of January 1927.This memorandum, which is now a landmark in the history of Anglo-Chinese relations, was followed by an offer of measures for treaty modification which His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to take if the Chinese authorities in North or South desired them to do so. This offer was presented to Dr. Wellington Koo and Dr. Eugene Chen respectively on the 27th and 28th January; it deals with the recognition of the Chinese law courts, of a reasonable Chinese Nationality Law, of the application of Chinese law in British courts, of the payment of Chinese taxation by British subjects, consideration of the application of the revised Chinese Penal Code, modification of the municipal administration of British concessions and the rights of British missionaries and their converts. The publication of this offer, which at the time the Chinese affected to disparage, has had an increasing influence in promoting a more friendly attitude towards Great Britain. It has taken the sting-out of the attack on Great Britain as protagonist of the old treaty position; and it has placed the Chinese in a quandary, since, when they come to work out the details for modification, they find that practical difficulties are very great, and that there is more to&apos; be said in favour of the old arrangements than they could ever be brought to admit.Russian Influence in China.The violently anti-British attitude of the revolutionary Government in Canton in its early stages was largely due to the fact that they were dependent for their success upon arms and advice supplied to them with lavish hand by Soviet Russia. The alliance between Moscow and the Canton Kuomintang dates from the conversa-tions between M. Joffe and Dr. Sun Yat-sen in January 1923; it was confirmed by the admission of Communists into the Kuomintang at the party congress in January 1924; but the Russians did not get a chance of asserting themselves until after the Shanghai, Shakee and other incidents in the summer of 1925. The capture of Hankow by the Nationalist forces marked the zenith of the Russian influence, and this influence did its best to provoke another incident by the mob attack on the British concession at Hankow in January 1927. This incident never took place owing to the self-control of the British authorities and armed forces on the spot. From that date onwards the rift between Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist military
leader, and the Russians became more and more apparent, until it culminated in the outrages against foreigners at Nanking on the 24th March, 1927, which was an attempt by the extreme party to embroil Chiang Kai-shek with the foreign Powers. From that date onwards Chiang Kai-shek, took the most rigorous measures against all Communists in those parts of the country which were under his control; and eventually, after agreement between him and Feng Yu-hsiang on the subject, Borodin and the remaining Russian advisers at Hankow had to flee from the country in July 1927. Russian agents having attempted to bring about a Communist rising in Canton in December of the same year, vigorous measures of repression were taken against them; the Soviet vice-consul and other Russians were shot, and the Nationalist Government ejected Soviet officials throughout Central and Southern China. Since that date Russian influence in China has been practically dead. Since this spectacular intervention of Russia in Chinese affairs may be regarded on its political side as a very dangerous attack on the position of the British Empire in Asia, its signal and humiliating defeat may be considered a striking success for British diplomacy.Shanghai Defence Force,The danger, however, was so evident and so serious that, after the events at Hankow, a British force, which at one time numbered some 20,000 officers and men, was sent to Shanghai. From the middle of the year onward, however, more peaceful conditions prevailed and the Russian influence was on the wane, so it was possible to reduce the Defence Force, and there are now only some 2,000 to 3,000 British troops in Shanghai.The Chen-0&apos;Malley Agreement.The strengthening of our naval and military forces in China was not the only step taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to liquidate the very difficult situation which had arisen. Our policy was, in fact, a double one :. (a) to protect British life and property; and (b) to continue our efforts to reach an understanding on the basis of the December memorandum and the January offer with any Chinese Government that was prepared to be reasonable. In order t.o give unmistakable proof of the sincerity of the latter part of our policy we refrained from using our military strength to restore our former position at Hankow, and we proceeded to negotiate with the Nationalist Government for a transfer of the administrative powers in the former British concession. The agreement embodying this transfer (together with another agreement dealing with the small Kiukiang concession) was signed by Mr. OMalley and Dr. Eugene Chen on the 19th February, 1927. By this agreement the former concession was made into a special administrative district under a Sino-British Bureau with a Chinese director. This agreement, which was very adversely criticised at the time by British residents in the Far East, has, after an unsteady beginning, worked satisfactorily during the last two years. The attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the question of the Hankow concession was a most important factor in inspiring the Chinese Nationalists with a sense of confidence in our sincerity.Settlement of the Nanking Incident.After the final rout of Russian influence from China at the end of 1927, relations between Great Britain and the National Government now established at Nanking rapidly improved, but could not be definitely placed on a satisfactory footing until that Government had accepted responsibility for the Nanking outrages of the 24th March, 1927, and had made reparation therefor. As this step involved the &quot; face&quot; of the new Government, much difficulty and delay attended this settlement, but it was at last effected by an exchange of notes, dated the 9th August, 1928. In these notes the. National Government expressed their profound regret, reported punishment of guilty persons, and proposed that a Sino-British Commission be instituted to assess the damages with a view to compensation. In a note signed simultaneously the British Government explained the reasons which necessitated the measures taken by H.M.S &quot;Emerald&quot; to protect British lives on that occasion, and in a further note we stated that we would not allow the Nanking incident to alter our sympathetic attitude towards China on the subject of treaty revision. .-[20324] c
- Tariff Autonomy.The settlement of the Nanking incident cleared the way for a settlement of the tariff autonomy question. The demand for tariff autonomy had been in the fore-front of Chinese claims ever since the time of the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. It was an obviously reasonable one, the only dangers in granting this demand being the unreliability of the Chinese administration, its unsound finance and economics, and the fact that for some years there had been rival Governments in the country and therefore internal difficulties over the control of Customs revenues. The establish-ment of the National Government at Nanking, however, removed some of these objections, and on the 25th July, 1928, the United States Government took the lead by signing a treaty recognising complete national tariff autonomy for China to come into force on the 1st January, 1929, subject to most-favoured-nation treatment. This condition, of course, passed the responsibility for further steps to the other Powers, and by the end of the year treaties embodying similar provisions had been signed by China with Germany, Norway, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Portugal, Netherlands, Great Britain, Sweden, France and Spain. The date of the signing of the British treaty was the 20th December, 1928. No such treaty was signed with Japan, but an arrangement was reached by which Japan placed no obstacle in the way of the Chinese Government, and a new and higher tariff schedule was accordingly put into force on the 1st February, 1929. The British treaty obtains most-favoured-nation treatment for British goods and for tonnage dues on British ships, and also national treatment as regards goods imported or exported by British subjects. With the signature of these treaties and the coming into force of the new schedule the tariff question, which played so large a part in the Washington Conference of 192.1-22 and the Peking Conference of 1925-26, may be considered as liquidated. So long, however, as Japan withholds her consent, the Chinese Government cannot absolutely establish their right to tariff autonomy. This, of course, is being held up by Japan not so much as a practical measure, but as a bargaining counter in the general treaty negotiations which are now in progress.Treaty Revision.TJ It is now generally accepted, and it is definitely laid down in our December memorandum, that, however disorderly internal conditions in China may continue to be, the time has come to place the relations of the Powers with China upon a more modern basis than that provided by the old treaties of the period 1842-76. The question of tariff autonomy has now been settled. There remains the question of that heterogeneous collection of &quot;servitudes,&quot; which is loosely known as extra-territoriality; but before discussing this question in its present aspect, it may be useful to outline the progress that has been made in carrying out the British offer of January 1927, as follows :-(1.) Recognition of modern Chinese law courts as the competent courts for cases brought by British plaintiffs or complainants without attendance of a British representative. This is now in force.(2.) Recognition of a reasonable Chinese Nationality Law. A carefully studied solution for this complicated question which vitally affects the &quot;Anglo-Chinese&quot; of Hong Kong and Malaya has now been evolved, and is the subject of negotiations with the Chinese Government; a working arrangement is actually in force in South China.(3.) Application in British courts in China of the modern Chinese civil and commercial codes, &amp;c. No progress has been made, since when these codes, &amp;c, came to be examined they were found to be incomplete and unsuitable for application in the British courts, with the single exception of the trade-mark law.(4.) Payment of regular and legal Chinese taxation by British subjects. As a matter of fact British firms pay most, if not all, of the various consumption taxes, stamp taxes, &amp;c, which are now being levied in a haphazard fashion on Chinese and foreign goods alike. We have not, however, made this taxation legally enforceable in the British courts by means of King&apos;s Regulations, since these taxes are too disorderly to justify any such recognition; British firms, have, however, been advised that it is wisest to pay the taxation under protest. In the case of the ex-British concession at Kiukiang, municipal taxation has recently been made enforceable through the British court.    .
(5.) Application-in British courts of the Chinese Penal Code. The Provisional CriminalCode of 1912 lias only recently been replaced by a new code, which came into force on the 1st September, 1928. The application of the new code in British courts will probably be considered during the forthcoming negotiations On the general question of extra-territoriality.(6.) Modification of municipal administrations of British concessions : &apos;&quot;(a.) Hankow. Restored to Chinese control under the Chen-CMalley Agree-meht of 1927, which is now working satisfactorily.(b.) Kiukiang. Restored to Chinese control by the Chen-CMalley Agreement of 1927.(c.) Chinkiang.--Has been restored to Chinese control under similar arrange-ment as at Kiukiang. Chinese are granting perpetual leases to former tenants of His Majesty&apos;s Government..(d.) Amoy. No change.(e.) Canton, i.e., Shameen. No change.(f.) Tientsin. Constitution of the British concession has been modified so as to allow Chinese to vote on equal terms with foreigners, and to provide for increase of Chinese representation on the municipal Council; these arrangements are working satisfactorily. . -It will be remembered in this connexion that there is no British concession at Shanghai, but that the International Settlement there is, technically at any rate, international.(7.) Special treaty privileges possessed by British missionaries. These have been, or are in course of being, surrendered.The Chinese have approached the question of treaty revision in a characteristically ingenious manner. The old treaties of the 1842-76 period contained no clauses to admit of their abrogation or amendment except as regards the commercial or tariff clauses, which in some, but not in all, cases might at the end of each decennial period be revised. On the 26th November, 1926, the end of a decennial period was reached in the case of the Sino-Belgian Treaty of 1865. The Chinese Government (Peking) assumed to itself the right of denunciation, not merely of the commercial clauses but of the whole treaty. Belgium, a weak Power, first appealed to the other Powers for assistance, and then applied to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague for redress, but eventually gave way, and on the 1st April, 1927, accepted Chinese regulations governing the status of Belgian nationals in China pending the conclusion of a new treaty. Similar methods were applied to Spain, and to Italy, and (on the 19th July, 1928) to Japan; more recently to Denmark, Portugal and Sweden. The National Government on the 13th July, 1928, issued provisional regulations to apply to the nationals of such countries, whose treaties had been &quot; terminated,&quot; dealing with them as though they had completely lost their extra-territoriality; however, the notes attached to the tariff treaties signed with Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Portugal and Spain leave it to be inferred that the nationals of those countries retain their extra-territorial rights, since their respective Governments agree to surrender such rights when the Washington Powers shall have agreed to such surrender. Japan has refused throughout to admit the Chinese contentions, and absolutely denies China&apos;s right to &quot; denounce &quot; her treaty. The principal AngloTChinese treaty ( hat of 1858) will be due for &quot;denunciation&quot; (as regards its tariff and commercial clauses) on the 30th October, 1930.Extra-territoriality.The whole effort of the Chinese Government is now centred in obtaining ostensibly the abolition, though perhaps in fact the modification, of the extra-Lerritorial system. They have already obtained from the Governments of Italy, Denmark, Portugal and Spain an assurance that extra-territoriaiity will be surrendered by them when all the Powers signatory to the Washington treaties have come to a similar agreement. Belgium has promised to surrender extra-territoriality as soon as the majority of the Powers now possessing such privileges have agreed to relinquish them. At the end of April 1929 the Chinese Government addressed to the Governments of Great Britain, the United States, Netherlands. Prance, Norway and Brazil &apos;a note expressing &apos;&apos; their strong desire for a removal of the limitations of Chinese jurisdictional sovereignty imposed upon her by the old treaties concluded[20324] c 2
between China and the foreign Powers.&quot; The Powers were invited to relinquish their extra-territorial privileges. To this note His Majesty&apos;s Government replied pointing out that China cannot yet be opened up as a Western country can, and that therefore some kind of treaty port system must continue for the present, and with the treaty port system some modified degree of extra-territoriality.The Chinese Government were invited to suggest ways and means by which that interim period could be tided over. The Chinese Government replied with another note, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government sent a further reply reiterating their willingness to enter into negotiations and again inviting the Chinese Government to make suggestions. The Chinese, however, are publicly committed to complete abolition on the 1st January, 1930, and they can hardly compromise their position by coming forward with suggestions for modification. There are many indications, however, that in fact they are prepared to compromise. In order, therefore, to forestall the dangerous situation which might arise if &apos;an edict of abolition were published in the teeth of the Powers&apos; refusal, general instructions were telegraphed to Sir Miles Lampson on the 2nd November. He is instructed to concentrate on the method of transfer of jurisdiction in the genera.! order: (1) civil cases, (2) criminal cases, and (3) personal status matters. We stated that it is only under heading (1) that progress is practicable in the near future and that we should firmly resist any attempt to obtain transfer of criminal jurisdiction until the experience gained of administration of civil jurisdiction by the Chinese courts demonstrates that they can be entrusted with criminal jurisdiction without excessive prejudice to the interests of British subjects. As regards civil jurisdiction, the Chinese codes must first be carefully examined in collaboration with Chinese delegates; and to provide safeguards it is desirable that the Chinese should employ foreign judges, one of whom would sit with the Chinese j udges in the modern court when a foreigner is the defendant. Suits between British subjects are to continue to be heard in the British court, but suits between foreigners of different nationality should be heard in the Chinese court. Even as regards criminal jurisdiction a beginning might be made with minor matters, such as breaches of municipal regulations and police offences. As regards civil jurisdiction, the position of British shipping and the enforcement of Chinese taxation will require special consideration. These instructions were drafted after careful consideration of alternative proposals put forward by some of the Foreign Ministers in Peking to the effect that the matter should be approached from a geographical standpoint, i.e., that extra-territoriality should first be abandoned in the interior, retaining the present system as regards the principal treaty ports. The surrender of extra-territoriality in remote places where few foreigners live would make no visible difference in the existing system and seems hardly a proposition that would appeal to the Chinese. We see considerable difficulties in allowing a distinction to be made between British subject A who lives in the interior and British subject B who lives in a treaty port, all the more as British subject A would probably have to be brought down to the treaty port in order to be tried in the nearest modern court. We also think that wholesale abandonment of extra-territorial rights in the interior would undermine our contention that the state of administration of justice in China does not permit of foreigners generally being made amenable to the jurisdiction of the Chinese courts. Our proposals have been communicated to the interested Powers and have received a considerable measure of support. There seems a fair prospect that all will pursue a common line in the forthcoming negotiations.In short, we wish to make progress in this question which the Chinese have so much at heart, but it seems to us essential that this progress should be slow; that during the transition period there should be adequate&quot; safeguards provided for foreigners; and that we should endeavour to preserve unity with the other foreign Powers concerned.The Chinese, on the other hand, are anxious to force the pace. It was no doubt with that object that they let it be known that they intended to abolish extra-territorial privileges on the 1st January, 1930. The Chinese Minister stated officially on the 29th November that this had been decided. At the same time, it was apparent that the Chinese contemplated negotiations on the subject, which could not in the nature of things be terminated by the end of the year. It would have been possible to treat the decision as an arbitrary and illegal act and to refuse to negotiate unless it was reconsidered. This, however, would merely have led to a deadlock and we should eventually have been forced to negotiate in humiliating circumstances.   It therefore appeared to be the wisest policy to endeavour to ensure
that the declaration abolishing extra-territoriality should be worded in as harmless a form as possible,  i.e.,  more as a  statement of  principle than a  definite announcement of abolition.  A start with negotiations would probably have had this effect, but a recrudescence of civil war in December prevented any such step. A memorandum was therefore communicated to the Chinese Government on the 20th December stating that His Majesty&apos;s Government were willing to agree that the 1st January, 1930, should be treated as the date from which the process of the gradual abolition of extra-territoriality should be regarded as having commenced in principle, and would have no objection to any declaration conformable with that attitude which the Chinese Government might think it desirable to issue.   His Majesty&apos;s Government were ready to enter into detailed negotiations as soon as political conditions in China rendered it possible to do so, with a view to agreeing on a method and a programme for carrying abolition of extra-territoriality into effect by gradual and progressive stages to the mutual satisfaction of both Governments.   The Chinese Government returned an appreciative answer, and on the 28th December issued a skilfully-worded mandate to the effect that, as from the 1st January, all foreign nationals in China should abide by Chinese law and that the competent authorities were to prepare, for examination and deliberation, a plan for the execution of this mandate.    Since the mandate did not provide that foreigners should be brought before Chinese courts, and left the way open for negotiations, it was possible, and it was judged wisest, not to allow it to deflect us from our course, but to take the line of assuming that it was intended to be a declaration of the kind which we had indicated would be acceptable; that line was accordingly taken in a further memorandum communicated to the Chinese Minister on the 1st January, which, further, pointed out the importance of the impending negotiations not being jeopardised by untoward incidents, and stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, fully expected that the Chinese Government would issue strict instructions to all provincial and local officials that the treaties affecting British subjects were to be regarded as continuing in full vigour and effect until modified by agreement.Sir Miles Lampson left Peking for Nanking on the 2nd January to open negotiations on the basis of the instructions outlined above.Our attitude on the subjject of judicial extra-territoriality (both as regards civil and criminal matters) has been indicated above; there remains the administrative side of extra-territoriality, which involves the method of government of foreign concessions, the taxation of foreign persons and companies in China and the immunity of foreign shipping. These are all questions of importance. The conces-sions in which His Majesty&apos;s Government are still interested are the British concessions at Tientsin, Amoy and Canton (Shameen), and also our preponderant share in the administration of the International Settlement at Shanghai. This last will be discussed under a separate heading. The concessions at Amoy and Canton are of little importance ; the government of the British concession at Tientsin is at present working smoothly under a municipality in which the Chinese have a considerable share. As regards taxation, the legal position is that British subjects and companies are immune from all taxation, except such as is sanctioned in existing treaties [i.e., the maritime customs duties). As a matter of fact, they have to pay, especially on the transport of goods, a large number of illegal taxes. It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to advise merchants in their own interest to pay these taxes under protest so long as there is no discrimination as between foreign and Chinese goods.Foreign shipping is at present immune from any interference by the Chinese authorities, and from any taxation, except tonnage dues, as regards which we have most-favoured-nation treatment. Foreign ships have the right to visit any treaty ports on Chinese inland waterways that they are able to reaclf; and they practise the right (though the treaties with Italy and some other minor Powers from which the right derives are probably no longer operative) to engage in Chinese coastwise traffic between treaty ports. These are rights of the greatest importance to British shipping. It is clear that China will wish to reserve her coastwise and river trade to Chinese vessels and also to extend her authority over British vessels; but it is also clear that the Chinese mercantile marine is not yet sufficiently developed to deal with so huge a volume of trade, and that for an interim period at least the Chinese will have to come to some compromise with the foreign shipping companies (principally British and Japanese). Such compromises have been tentatively under discussion, but the question has not yet become a live issue.
Commercial Treaty.In an attempt to provide a basis for discussions with the Chinese, a draft commercial treaty, framed on the usual pattern, but avoiding any issue that might bring up the question of extra-territoriality, was submitted by Sir M. Lampson to the Chinese authorities in June 1929. The Chinese replied with a counter-draft, which raised several contentious issues, and the matter was referred to examination by experts. But no progress was made along these lines, since the Chinese clearly preferred that the extra-territorial issue should first be settled. The draft commercial treaty deals, among others, with such questions as taxation and shipping.Shanghai.   *The future of Shanghai is perhaps for foreigners the most important of all Chinese questions. This great city, which already has a population of some 2 millions, is likely to expand into the most populous city area in the world. This city is at present divided into five administrative areas: (1) the International Settlement, in which nearly 1 million Chinese are resident; (2) the French concession; and (3), (4) and (5) the areas under purely Chinese administration, known in the aggregate as Greater Shanghai. At present, attention is concentrated on the International Settlement, which is the business centre of the city. It is governed by a municipal council, consisting, up to 1928, of nine foreigners (five British); last year three Chinese members were added. The administration of the city is on British lines, and is largely staffed with British personnel. The Chinese naturally contend that China should have complete control of the principal city of China. The reply is (and many Chinese realise, though they will not admit, this) that no Chinese Government is as yet fit to control the destinies of a city which, for complexity and importance, compares with London and New York. There is no practicable cut and dried solution for the problem of the future government of Shanghai. Each point in a difficult situation must be dealt with as it arises, always bearing in mind that the eventual destiny of Shanghai is to be a city under purely Chinese control. Unfortunately, the municipal council appear to have lost faith in themselves, and to believe that the remedy is to be found, not in their own patience and understanding of the situation, but in some Government action or other. An under-current of panic has become noticeable which may provoke the very crisis which Shanghai is most anxious to avoid.The question of Chinese representation on the municipality having been settled, the outstanding problem is that of the Provisional Court.This court is a Chinese court established for the purpose of administering justice to the million Chinese residents in the International Settlement. From its inception in 1864 a certain amount of foreign control has been exercised with the consent of the Chinese authorities with a view to maintaining municipal authority and ensuring that the administration of justice shall approximate to Western standards. The revolution of 1911 and the resulting chaos placed the court of necessity almost completely under foreign consular and municipal control. In January 1927 a provisional agreement was reached with the local Government restoring the court to the control of the Chinese Government, but retaining certain safeguards, such as the presence of consular deputies at the trial of certain classes of cases. This agreement has worked badly, and has caused serious friction. It is now due for revision, and the Chinese will probably wish greatly to diminish the foreign element in the court. All sides are agreed that the court as at present constituted is highly unsatisfactory. The court is no longer under the preponderating influence of the British consulate-general and the foreign deputies, who are now, under the Rendition Agreement, drawn from many different consulates, have in practice proved a source of irritation rather than a safeguard. In the negotiations which are about to commence we hope to be able to go a long way to meet the wishes of the Chinese and thus set up a new court which will prove satisfactory to both sides. As the court derives its authority solely from the Chinese Government, and as the police which carry out its decisions derive their authority from the municipal council, there is an inevitable conflict between executive and judiciary which is bound to exist so long as there is a foreign Government in the International Settlement. These conflicts cannot be composed by reference to higher authority, and, therefore, harmony between the executive and judiciary Without which the government of the settlement cannot be carried oh can only be obtained
by the exercise of tact and discretion and by goodwill on both sides. Machinery for settling conflicts is one of the matters being considered in the negotiations now in progress.One other point must be remembered as regards Shanghai, and that is, whenever real danger threatens, the city (as it did in 1927) British interests, both economic and political, are so great that British troops must be sent to protect the settlement, just as though it were a British possession. The Defence Force has now been reduced to some 2,000 to 3,000 troops. As regards the immediate safety of foreigners in Shanghai, it seemed until quite lately that this force might be withdrawn; but the recent recrudescence of civil war which appeared at one moment to threaten the existence of the Nanking Government and to portend an enforced retreat of their forces to the coast shows that it would be risky to regard the danger to Shanghai from the civil war as over. At the present crisis of the extra-territoriality negotia-tions, moreover, such a withdrawal would almost inevitably be interpreted by the Chinese as a sign of weakness, and they would probably increase their demands. The troops, therefore, should remain at Shanghai for the present. As soon as our negotiations are satisfactorily concluded they should, if the situation otherwise permits, be withdrawn as a gesture in celebration of the settlement. In practice, their presence is not resented by the Chinese, and there have not been even any official protests against them since the early days of 1927.The question of securing some contribution from the British community at Shanghai for the special military protection which has been afforded to them for nearly two years presents certain practical difficulties, and would appear to be a matter for further consideration. The municipal council charged no rent for their land and buildings occupied by the Shanghai Defence Force, and similar generosity has been displayed by individual residents. Any direct contribution, however, from an international body like the municipal council would, of course, be impossible, while suggestions for the levy of an income tax on British subjects abroad have hitherto not been pursued, in view of the difficult constitutional issues involved.Weihaiwei and Boxer Indemnity.These two outstanding questions may be coupled together, inasmuch as they both date in their present form from 1922, both arise from a desire on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to be conspicuously generous to China, and in both cases we have been left in the lamentable position of running about for seven years with a gift in each hand, which we have been unable to deliver.(a.) Weihaiwei.At the Washington Conference in 1922, as a contribution to the settlement of the Shantung question, we announced that we would hand the lease of Weihaiwei back to China m return for arrangements which would permit His Majesty&apos;s ships to use the island and anchorage for hospital purposes and for a summer station, also in return for due consideration being given to the foreign interests which had grown up at the port. As the Chinese were not really interested, considerable delay took place in the subsequent negotiations, but in the summer of 1924 a joint agreement was reached which His Majesty&apos;s Minister was instructed to sign, but at that psychological moment a revolutionary coup d&apos;Etat took place, with the result that the recognised Chinese Government disappeared and a provisional Government was established which was not formally recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government until more than a year later. By that date the growth of the rival Southern Government showed that China was in full disruption, and it was considered inadvisable to take any steps for the rendition of Weihaiwei to a Government in so precarious a plight as was the Northern Government at Peking. The question was resumed in 1929 with the National Government at Nanking, and it appeared at first that agreement would be reached more or less on the basis of the 1924 draft. But during the negotia-tions the Chinese attitude changed and a demand was put forward that, since it was desired to convert Weihaiwei into a Chinese naval base, facilities for His Majesty&apos;s ships should be discontinued after a term of three years, that the place should be closed as a commercial port and no facilities be given for foreign residents or trade. This volte face would have justified His Majesty&apos;s Government in with-drawing the 1922 offer and reverting to the position before it was made.   But it
lbis doubtful whether Weihaiwei is worth so extreme a step. Sir M. Lampson has been instructed that, when a suitable occasion arises, he should propose to the Chinese : (a) That they should provide the facilities conceded by the 1924 agreement at some other suitable place; (b) that the cost of providing such facilities should be borne by the Chinese Government in return for the free cession of the British naval property on the island; (c) that the British naval property on the island should be surrendered when these alternative facilities are ready; and (d) that foreign property owners should be bought out by the Chinese Government.Here the matter rests for the present. Sir M. Lampson has not yet submitted these proposals to the Chinese. If they accept them, well and good; if they refuse, it will be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to choose between the alternative evils of further retreat or further delay.(b.) Boxer Indemnity.At the end of 1922 His Majesty&apos;s Government notified to China that they had decided in principle to devote the proceeds of the British share of the Boxer Indemnity to projects mutually beneficial to China and Great Britain. These payments amounted in all to some  11 million, payment being spread over the years 1922 to 1945. In order to divert these funds parliamentary action was necessary, and this involved delay from the outset. However, the China Indemnity (Application) Act of 1925 was finally placed on the Statute Book on the 30th June, 1925, exactly one month after the Shanghai incident, and when China was ablaze from end to end with anti-British agitation. The whole circumstances of the situation in fact had changed since 1922. A delegation under the chairmanship of Lord Willingdon was sent to China to see what could be done. It submitted a report with numerous proposals which was published at the end of 1926 (Command Paper 2766 : &apos;&apos; China,&quot; No. 2, 1926). Within a month after that publication anti-British influences had brought about the mob attack on the Hankow and Kiukiang concessions, and His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to send the defence force to Shanghai. Once again the moment was unpropitious for a gift of the character which we had intended. The question was, however, resumed with a united and friendly Chinese Government in the spring of 1929 on the basis of a proposal to hand over the adminis-tration of the funds to the control of the Chinese Government in return for an under-taking that they would carry out the general lines of the educational programme recommended in the published report, and also that a considerable portion of the funds would be used in the first instance for purchasing railway materials in Great Britain, thus providing China with goods urgently required for the rehabilitation of railways and at the same time helping to deal with the vital unemployment question in this country. An agreement on these lines was on the point of being reached when the Chinese Minister of Communications intervened with suggested modifications which would have nullified the stipulation that orders for railway material should be placed in this country, while at the same time it became known that the Chinese Government desired to use the Avhole or greater part of the funds for completing the Canton-Hankow Railway. This project is, however, subject to a pre-existing agreement, viz., the Hukuang Railway Loan Agreement of 1911, and the effect of this agreement and of subsidiary agreements between the parties interested (other than China) is that orders for materials for the completion of the line if placed abroad would have to be put up to open tender. At present prices this is tantamount to saying that such orders would not go to Great Britain. A deadlock has therefore arisen, and, in order that progress may be made, the following contradictory principles have somehow to be reconciled :  (a.) The desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government that their part in the mutual benefit shall take the form of orders for railway materials placed in this country.(&amp;.) The desire of the Chinese that the funds shall be devoted first and foremost to the completion of the Canton-Hankow Railway.A possible way out of the difficulty has been evolved by the Foreign Office and concurred in by other departments concerned, by Sir Miles Lampson and by the Advisory Committee set up under the Act of 1925. Detailed instructions for revised proposals to the Chinese Government have accordingly been drafted and sent to Sir Miles Lampson. -
Maritime Customs Administration.The Maritime Customs Administration first came into existence in the year 1842 when five ports were opened to foreign trade, and it became necessary to collect import and export duties on this trade. It is a purely Chinese administration in the sense that it is based on no foreign treaty rights. The employment of foreigners in the administration dates from the year 1855. The native officials of those days experienced considerable difficulties in collecting duties from foreign merchants, and these difficulties were greatly enhanced by the Taiping rebellion then raging. Foreign &quot; inspectors &quot; were first employed at Shanghai, and the system was so successful that it was quickly extended to other ports. Mr. (afterwards Sir Robert) Hart became Inspector-General in 1865, and was succeeded on his death in 1911 by Sir Francis Aglen. The administration collects the import and export duties, the coast trade duties, transit duties, tonnage dues on foreign shipping, and is also charged with the lighting and buoying of China&apos;s coast, harbours and navigable rivers. It is an international service, but about half the staff are British. It has been pre-eminently a British institution; English is the official language and the administration is moulded on British lines.The maintenance of the Maritime Customs Administration intact has in the past been regarded as a vital British interest. The administration was built up by the genius of a great Englishman the late Sir Robert Hart who controlled its destinies for over forty years and saw it grow from small beginnings to a great service employing some 1,400 foreigners and over 6,000 Chinese. It has conferred immense benefits both upon China and upon the foreign merchants who trade with her, and both Chinese and foreigners of all nationalities have been unstinted in their praise and admiration. The value to our prestige of this great monument to British probity and British efficiency is an important asset to our position in China.To the British merchant it is also vital that the Customs Administration should continue to be run on the lines which have hitherto guided it, thus ensuring him fair and impartial treatment, not merely in the levy of duties, but in the application of the complicated rules governing trade in China.The efficient collection of her customs revenues has up to now been the mainstay of China&apos;s credit and the principal security of the foreign bondholder. The foreign loans secured upon the customs amount to  224 million. The original British share cf these loans was  31 million, of which nearly  20 million is still outstanding. The first loans secured upon customs revenues were contracted between 1894 and 1898 in consequence of the J apanese war. The foreign debt was greatly increased by the Boxer Indemnity imposed upon China in 1900. Up to 1894 only four-tenths of the customs revenues had been remitted to Peking, the remaining six-tenths being retained by the provinces, but by the end of the Manchu regime in 1911 the whole customs revenues, were absorbed by the service of the debt. Owing to increase in trade, and the remission of the Boxer indemnity in 1917, considerable surpluses resulted from the introduction of the Washington surtaxes and of the new tariff schedule; but these new revenues were at once mortgaged by the National Govern-ment to the extent of some  20 million, raised by means of internal short-term loans.The year 1911 marks a crucial epoch in the history of the Customs Administra-tion. Up to 1911 the foreign Inspector-General of Customs merely controlled tiie machinery which collected the revenues, but did not actually handle any money. The duties were paid direct to the Chinese superintendent at each port, and the Chinese authorities made their own arrangements for remitting the revenues to the Central Government, for the custody of the funds, and for the service of the loans secured upon those revenues. It is worthy of note that China never defaulted on her obligations, and her credit always stood deservedly high.When the revolution broke out in 1911 there was not unnaturally a period of considerable confusion. Some officials remained loyal to the Manchus, some turned over to the revolutionaries, and some ran away. The system of government broke down, and for the first time default actually occurred.In order to save the customs revenues from falling into the hands of revolu-tionaries, and perhaps diverted from the service of the foreign debt, Sir John Jordan effected an arrangement by which the customs duties at each port were paid to the foreign Commissioner of Customs, and by him remitted to the account- of the Inspector-General in certain foreign banks in Shanghai. This arrangement was embodied in the Custodian Bank Agreement of the 30th January, 1912.[20324] n
is this agreement constituted the Diplomatic Body the trustees of the whole customs revenues to see that all foreign obligations secured thereon up to that time were duly met. Later, when the revenues began to show a surplus this was interpreted as covering foreign control over the surplus customs revenues, which could not be released by the Inspector-General to the Peking Government without the consent of the Diplomatic Body. The agreement -further effected a fundamental change in the character of the Customs Administration, which henceforth combined the dual functions of (1) an organ of the Chinese Government, and (2) the instrument through which the Diplomatic Body executed its trust and maintained its control over the whole customs revenue.The Customs Administration (under Sir Francis Aglen) supported by the Diplomatic Body, thus became for a time the paymaster and to some extent the master of the Chinese Government (at Peking). Being exclusively identified with the Northern Government, it became an object of attack by the Nationalist Government at Canton, who publicly proclaimed their hatred of it as an instrument of foreign oppression and their determination to abolish it altogether. During 1926-27 the position of Sir F. Aglen became more and more invidious; his administration had to serve two Governments at war with one another; and had to make arrangements for the collection of tariff duties (the Washington surtaxes) which, owing to the opposition of Japan, it was not, by treaty, permitted to collect. Finally, for refusing to collect these surtaxes and for daring to initiate personal relations with the Southern Government, Sir Francis Aglen was dismissed by the Northern Government on the 31st January, 1927. That Government thereupon appointed Mr. Edwardes to be Acting Inspector-General; the National Government at Nanking, however, relied upon Mr. Maze, Commissioner of Customs at Shanghai, as their principal adviser in customs matters. This undignified and dangerous schism continued for nearly two years, and was terminated by the voluntary resignation of Mr. Edwardes on the 1st January, 1929, and the appoint-ment of Mr. Maze as full Inspector-General. Since the issue of the memorandum of December 192&apos;6, the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been to reverse the policy of foreign control of Chinas customs revenues and to restore the Customs Administration to the position which it occupied before the revolution in the time of Sir Robert Hart, namely, that of a trusted and efficient servant of the Chinese Government and not their master. It was felt that this was the only means of saving the Administration from destruction. As a result of the steady pressure we have brought to bear since 1926, and also largely in consequence of the appointment of Mr. Maze, this object has now in great measure been achieved.Mr. Maze has shown intelligence and understanding in dealing with his difficult task. He has pulled the administration together and re-established its position in the eyes of the Chinese. But already it is clear that it will become increasingly a Chinese service, and that the days of a Chinese Inspector-General are not far distant. So far as the personnel are concerned, the Customs Administration is therefore much less important a British interest than it was even as late as 1925; but as regards its functions as mediator between Chinese Government and foreign merchant, its importance is as great as ever, and every effort should be made to see that, however much the Chinese share in it may be increased, the old spirit of Sir R. Harfs creation should be, so far as possible, maintained.. -Relations with Japan and other Powers.It is an axiom of British policy in China that co-operation should, so far as possible, be maintained with other Foreign Powers with interests in that country. The usual medium for such co-operation is to be found in the meetings of the Diplomatic Body at Peking. There, questions of common interest are discussed and policies are formulated in joint consultation by the respective Ministers for reference to their home Governments. Before the European War the prestige and authority of the Diplomatic Body were powerful factors in dealing with Chinese evasion and obstruction. The result of the War was to shatter this prestige and to weaken the position of the Powers both jointly and separately. Close co-operation, however, was supposed to exist between Great Britain and Japan in virtue of the Alliance Agreement. This, however, had been misused by Japan to further her own interests with little or no regard to those of her partner. The most flagrant instance is to be found in the circumstances of the presentation of the Japanese ultimatum to China in 1915, which is usually called the incident of the twenty-one demands.   This led
directly to the termination of the alliance, or rather to the substitution in its place of the Washington treaties, which seemed to prepare the way for a revival of the work of the Diplomatic Body by co-operation between the eight Powers (other than China) who took part in the Conference. This new form of co-operation did not work well, as is proved by the breakdown of the Tariff Conference and by the fact that, when in 1925 Great Britain was singled out for attack by the Chinese, the other PoAvers, so far from assisting us, seemed to rejoice in our discomfiture. The events of 1927, however, brought them together again, and when the Japanese became seriously involved through the fighting round Tsinanf u in May 1928, they approached His Majesty&apos;s Government with vague suggestions for some closer form of co-operation. Count Uchida, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, was sent to England in the following September in order to explain the aims and objects of his country&apos;s policy in China and to discuss ways and means for co-operation. This tentative project did not lead to any very practical result. The Ministers of the two countries in Peking were, however, instructed to keep in particularly close touch with one another, especially in the discussion of all questions of common interest, so that the Governments concerned might either agree to differ or else concur and concert such joint measures as might be taken as and when circumstances appeared to require. Such, has been the basis of British and Japanese policy in China since that date, and it has worked to the satisfaction and advantage of both parties.As a matter of fact, Japan&apos;s interests in China are so different from those of Great Britain that her policy is bound to take a somewhat different turn from our own. For instance, Japan is not nearly so concerned as we are in the maintenance of extra-territoriality. She is prepared to utilise the surrender of extra-territoriality in reaching a bargain with the Chinese for the protection of her special interests, especially in Manchuria. It is on these lines that the Japanese Minister is preparing to negotiate with China for a general settlement of treaty questions. In these circumstances we can never count upon the support of Japan, though it may sometimes suit her convenience to work with us.Consortium.Besides the political basis of co-operation between the various foreign Powers, a financial and economic basis exists in the form of the Consortium Agreement of 1920. This agreement has its roots in the history of the scramble for concessions in China which followed the Sino-Japanese war in 1895. Both the Governments and the business interests concerned had come to realise that co-operation was more satisfactory than unbridled competition. In post-war conditions this led to the formation of the present Four-Power Consortium, a project originally sponsored by the United States Government and warmly supported by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Consortium Agreement provided for equal participation on an absolutely equal basis between powerful and representative financial groups in Great Britain, the United States of America, Japan and France in all future public loans to the Chinese Government or Chinese Government Departments or to provinces of China, and it covers both loans for administrative purposes and loans for industrial undertakings (e.g., railways). This agreement was supported by the Governments concerned, each Government undertaking to give its complete support to its respective national group members of the consortium. The effect of the consortium since its establishment has been purely negative. It claims to have prevented loans being contracted by irresponsible and self-seeking politicians on improvident terms. As a matter of fact, during the last nine years the credit of China has been at so low an ebb that it is doubtful whether the inability to raise loans in foreign markets is to be ascribed to the consortium so much as to the actual circumstances of the case. In any case the whole idea of the consortium has been anathema to the Chinese, who regard it as an attempt by the Powers to get a financial stranglehold over their country. As their credit improves (and in present circumstances it ought to do so) they will certainly apply to extra-consortium bankers and to non-consortium countries for financial help rather than to the consortium itself. It is doubtful, therefore, whether the continuance of the consortium will be beneficial either to China or to the Powers concerned. Especially is this the case with regard to industrial loans, for if, for instance, the Chinese could put up a reasonable proposition for constructing a railway, no British firm within the scope of the consortium could touch it without bringing in its consortium partners; this would exasperate the Chinese and the proposition would be submitted elsewhere.  On the other hand, Flis Majesty&apos;s Govern-
ment could give no assistance to any extra-consortium British firm which might tender for the business. In dealing with our Boxer indemnity policy with reference to the construction of the Canton-Hankow Railway, we are beginning to feel in a very forcible manner how obstructive the obligations of the Consortium can be When a practical proposition is involved. These difficulties have now been submitted to Sir M. Lampson for his observations, which We are at present awaiting. It has been suggested to him that as regards the normal progress of economic development of China (i.e., railway and other industrial loans) it seems probable that no machinery Of international co-operation could be devised which would in fact prevent competition. The existence of any such machinery would probably tie the hands of British industrialists, but not those of their international competitors. It would therefore be better to revert to a regime of free and open competition.o
