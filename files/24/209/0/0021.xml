(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S &apos; GOVERNMENT.)SECRET. CP. 22 (30).CABINET.Reaction of the Indian Political Situation on Indian Government Securities.copy No . memorandum Toy the Secretary of State for India.For the past few months, Indian Government stocks have been in a depressed condition, reaching their nadir immediately after the Congress at Lahore which, inter alia, passed a Resolution forecasting repudiation of India&apos;s debt.   The question naturally arises whether anything can be done to promote confidence on the part of the British investor.   The alarm on the part of some British investors is illustrated by the letter from a Mr. Hollo way, of which I attach a copy. With my colleagues&apos; concurrence, I should wish to answer it in the terms of the letter of which I attach the draft I think that it would be helpful that this reply should be published.   Probably Mr&apos;.. Holloway would see to that in any case; but, if my colleagues concur in the draft, I could take steps to ensure that it is published.W.B.21st January, 1930.
Gooy of letter from Mr. H.W. Holloway, dated 13thJanuary, 1930, to tho Secretary of Stato for India.Dear Sir,Rocont ovonts and pronouncements in India have had a disastrous effect on investments in India stocks with consequent very considerable losses to investors in those stocks, some of iihich (such as the 4-g% 1958-68 Loan) are designated as &quot;Trustee&quot; stocks for which security is desired and expected.It scoins to mo a very bad thing for this country that confidence in such securities should be shaken thus, and it is humiliating and derogatory to tho country&apos;s credit generally.As you are no doubt aware the Indian extremists have announced their intention - if and whon they have tho power to do so - of repudiating any loans or obligations vhich they do not like.   It is reasonable to suppose that tho abovo-montionod Loan (or stock) might fall within this category and that the interost thereon etc. would duly be repudiated.Inasmuch as you are a member of the English Cabinet and that tho above-mentioned stock was guaranteed by either yourself or your predecessor in tho Office of Secretary of Stato for India I ask you for a definite pronouncement as to ibs safety.In case of repudiation by any Indian Government would the English. Government make good any loss to investors who have been asked to consider this a suitable investment for trust monies?Alternatively, in the event of India attaining self-government, would thoro bo somo sort of safeguard in tho moasuro granting such self-government whereby it would be laid down expressly that a nocessary condition thereof would bo tho full recognition and honouring of existing loans and obligations?As/
As a prospective- investor in the before-mentioned stock, on behalf of a trust perhaps you will give me some assurance on this extremely important matter.    If the credit of tho English Government is worth anything, and if it is to bo maintained in the eyes of the world at large, some such assurance is badly needed.I thank you for a reply in due course. Yours truly,(Sgd.) H.W. Holloway.
Dear Sir,The Secretary of State desires me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter on the subject of India sterling securities.In so far as your questions relate to hypothetical contingencies you will doubtless not expect the Secretary of State to attompt a reply which, from the nature of the case, could only represent a personal view.   But though the securities to which you refer are charged on the revenues of India alone they have been issued by the Secretary of State under the authority of Acts of Parliament and Mr. Secretary Bonn cannot conceive that in formulating any scheme of constitutional change in India, Parliament could fail to take into account the conditions under which these Loans were issued.In the meantime His Majesty&apos;s present Government have no intention of allowing a stato of things to arise in India in which repudiation of debt could become a practical possibility.I am, otc. ,Draft reply to Mr. Holloway.
