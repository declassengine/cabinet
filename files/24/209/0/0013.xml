I might mention the following instances: -The detailed proposals for the reduction of the 1928 Programme (in which connection may be mentioned also the successful prevention of Dockyard discharges in spite of the loss of new construction) which will in the next financial year show a saving of approximately  2,000,000;The anticipation of all possible economies onthe Singapore Scheme as stated in F.S.(29) 17;  andIn the matter actually under consideration, the acceptance of 50 cruisers as a basis for the Dawos conversations, as well as the continued advocacy of large savings on battleship replacement by reducing size and extending age;  also the abolition of submarines, with consequent reduction in destroyer tonnage.    Those proposals already in our programme will, if accomplished, produce results from a financial point of view of a highly satisfactory nature.These are matters which are, I imagine, alreadywithin the knowledge of my colleagues, but I would add that in preparing the Sketch Estimates for 1930 a largs number ofadditional economies have been  effected, including a reduction on Vote a of over 4,000 men.
The proposal of the Treasury to suspend all construction for another year and cruiser construction for two years, must mean the commencement before April next of heavy discharges from the Dockyards amounting in twelve months to&quot; several thousands.      It would also Involve a similar process in the case of the contract firms.    There would be great difficulty in   recollecting the skilled labour which would have been dispersed both from the Dockyards and the private firms when required to continue construction.    In the meantime we should have incurred very heavy and uneconomic charges for the maintenance of armament plant.The Treasury memorandum ignores entirely the importance of stabilir. ation, but that reductions should go hand in hand with stabilisation is the keynote of our policy. The Treasury memorandum clearly conteaplates the possibility of having &quot;to maintain the levels as then (1936) existing by a somewhat higher rate of replacement&quot;.    With that possibility in view I regard it as disastrous to dislocate our whole machinery for securing such replacement and as being quite contrary to our avowed policy of dealing with any Naval construction on a through policy instead of by fits and starts.To conclude,  a perusal of the Treasury and Admiralty Memoranda shows the real issue to be whether this country is now prepared to take a definitely inferior position in the world.     In spite of its commitments in British territory covering one-third of the globe,  in addition to those undertaken on behalf of the League of Nations, I would remind my colleagues that our land and air forces are very much below those of many nations having smaller commitments and that the main arm of defence of the British Commonwealth of Nations is the Navy.(Intd.)    a. V. a.IKIRALTY, S.W.I.20th December 1989.
THE TREASURY ^mORANDUM Oil Tim FIVIil-POV/ER OOHgSRiaiCE.Admiralty Note.I.    INTRODUCTION-Within five weeks of the assembly of a naval conference of the Powers at the invitation of H.1.1.Government the Treasury have put forward a memorandum suggesting that the British proposals should be re-cast.They recommend that the figures accepted as a basis for the conversations of the Prime llinister in Y.&apos;aahington should be rejected, and that we should enter the conference with fresh proposals, necessitating retraversing the ground covered by the Prime llinister in his conversations between July and October.      The fresh proposals \.ould require the complete reconsideration of the &quot;parity&quot; basis as between the U.S.A. and ourselves, and the scrapping of four months endeavour.If the basis of our proposals had been decided upon without full consideration of all the circumstances it might be desirable even at this stage to reconsider the matter. Actually, every argument In the Treasury memorandum has received the closest attention.      The question of the battleship holiday, the question of reduced cruiser replacement, the question of a smaller cruiser, the question of reduced destroyer and submarine tonnage, the age limit of ships, all have been dealt with in the course of the preliminary conversations and decisions have been taken, as a reference to the Prime Minister^ despatches will confirm.:As regards the financial implications the proposals have aimed at ensuring an overall reduction on present commitments.      \vhilst minor adjustments on our proposals nay be possible in order to obtain agreement, we have framed these proposals on the understanding with the
Dominions that whilst representing reductions they do give us a minimum naval strength adequate for cur purposes to-day after giving due weight to the present peaceful conditions and the recent signing of the Pact of Paris. .   .These proposals, it is considered, must stand as the proposals with which we enter the conference. If H.M. Government in the future feel that the financial conditions do nob permit of our implementing those proposals when it comes  to  the point, it will he necessary to face the situation thi:.n created.      lieanwhile, we cannot do less than base our future naval strength on a standard which conforms to the requirement of Article 8 of the Covenant of the League of Hat ions and bears some relation to the naval strength deemed necessary by other Powers, after making due allowance for practical reductions in the projected programmes of these Powers.
II.    SECURITY .u!D REDUCTION.In his covering note the Chancellor of the Exchequer states that the memorandum is not &quot;put forward on any&quot;&quot;acadenic view of the functions of various departments&quot; The Admiralty, however, feel bound to state that they are quite &quot;unable to agree that the memorandum contains nothing that is outside the province of the Treasury.      Ilor can the Admiraltj^ admit the accuracy of    the statement that &quot;only Treasuries want reductions&quot;.If the Treasury are able to discuss and put forward suggestions on strategical questions, such as the numbers and types of ships we require, the Admiralty, for their part, are equally capable of appreciating the necessity for reducing the expenditure of armaments.      The difference between the two Departments is briefly this, that while the Admiralty are desirous of reducing expenditure on armaments to the minimum compatible with security$ the Treasury desire reduotion for the sake of reduction, quite regardless of the effect on security.It is true that there is a reference in the Treasury i-Memorandum to the fact that &quot;our security in an emergency depends in the last resort on the superiority of our naval forces&quot;, but the Admiralty are unable to discover that any weight has been given to this consideration in reaching the conclusions and proposals set forth by the Treasury.The memorandum in fact does no more than set out suggested number of ships and other figures by which a reduction in naval estimates might be made.      Anyone with say a copy of &quot;Fleets&quot;  in front of him could do the seme, and the result would be equally useless unless such numbers and figures had-some regard to our commitments, the
preparations of other nations and world conditions generally, matters which receive scant attention in the Treaeury memorandum.The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his covering note also points out that TTthe public confidently expect that the policy of disarmament will lead to substantial reductions in the present rate of expenditure&quot; , but th.6 Admiralty firmly believe that the public are at the same time most jealous of the safety and free trading conditions necessary for the life of the Commonwealth.It seems necessary therefore to the Admiralty to re-state the position in regard to the number of cruisers considered necessary for security.
III .    CRUISERS KECESSARY FOR SECURITY.Repeated investigations carried out and laid before successive governments and Imperial Conferences have established the number of 70 cruisers as necessary for our full defensive requirements.    This number 70 is based on the necessity for defending our vital sea-communications in all parts of the world, the United States of America not being taken into account as a possible enemy.In general, this number 70 for security in theEast provides -25 cruisers for work with the battlefleet, which isconsidered by the Admiralty a minimum for the necessary strategical and tactical functions;25 cruisers are required on the vital lines of communi-cation stretching across the Indian Ocean and including the Persian Gulf and Western Pacific.    The lessons of the late war show our vulnerability in this area even from a power so badly situated geographically as German3r;10 cruisers are allotted to prevent our Home and mediterranean waters being entirely denuded;10 cruisers remain to cover Australia, S.Africa, Hew Zealand, Canada and the S.Atlantic and Eastern Pacific.For security in the west, the distribution above has, of course, to be modified.    When it is realised that the protection of our food supplies along the Atlantic routes, on the flank of a possible enemy, may involve on any one day over 30 convoys being at sea, not including arrangements for the Mediterranean and Eorth Sea, the number 70, after provision has been made for the battlefleet requirements, cannot be considered anything but a minimum figure.
The Treasury suggest that the figures of 70 ships and   450,000 tons have never existed save on paper and they give, tables showing numbers and cruiser tonnages from 1921 onwards.      Ho mention is made, however, of our enormous scrapping   programme in the previous years of ships worn out during the war and the decision taken by ii.11.Government gradually to rebuild our cruiser fleet to our requirements. If the position was to be shown in its proper perspective the Treasury memorandum should have stated that from 1910 to 1980 our number of cruisers exceeded 70 and a tonnage figure of over 500,000 tons, and in the years immediately before the war we never had less.than 100 cruisers of over 700,000 tons.The Admiralty has never receded from the position that 70 cruisers represent our full defence requirements. Und; the international conditions to-day for a strictly limited period of time the Admiralty accept a number of 50 cruisers provided adequate limitation of projected building programmes are made by other Powers and provided that in our number there is a proper proportion of new construction suitable for extended operations.      II. 1,-.Governments in the Dominions have be*an informed accordingly.The Treasury Memorandum   makes reference to a tentative remark attributed to Lord Beatty that 50 cruisers would meet our requirements (C.I.D.815-B).Lord BeattyTs own views to-day as opposed to a telegraphic report of what he said in 1921 can be obtained
at any time by H.i.I. Government, and if there is any doubt that Lord Beatty considers that our full requirements can be met with a number of cruisers less than 70 it is recommended that this should be done.The considered opinion of Lord Beatty is clearer shown in C.I.D.264-C, Appendix ITo.1 &quot;Empire Naval Strength&quot;, prepared by the Naval Staff under his direction for presentation to the Imperial Conference of 1926.The number of 70 cruisers is here given together with a footnote stating:-*&apos; quality with Japan so far as her programme is known with in addition 45 for Defence Of Trade Routes.    This number may have to be increased in the event of an increase in Japanese Cruiser Strength.&quot;The Strengths stated as required in other classes are also worth noting.This C-I.D. paper was presented to and approved by the Imperial Conference of 1926 with the consent of H.I-1. Government.Later in July, 1927, during the 3-Power Conference at Geneva, Lord Beatty again stressed the point that 70 cruisers was our minimum (C.I.D. 818-B).    At the Cabinet Committee of 1925 which investigated the Admiralty proposals for a 10 year building programme, Lord Beatty always upheld the number of 70 , and has re-affirmed this opinion in the House of Lords as recently as December 18th.-................-.....-............. ...........   .. .. .1&apos;... rv-- .E .1&apos;.*.:. -..:.....&apos;;      __........:   - .. ,   ............   :   .
IV*    POSITION Off 0TH5R PQV-SHg. uThe British Empire will approach the London Confer-ence in a frame of mind very different from those of the other Powerso    The U.3.A. for instance, is in no degree de-pendent for ^security on her Navy.    Prance is slightly more dependent than the U.S.A. hut relies chiefly on a vast Army. Italy is more dependent than France on the sea hut, for geographical reasons,  is unable to ensure security through maritime power.    Japan, next to ourselves,  is most dependent on naval force, but is so remote from any possible enemy that her position is one of security.    These countries can come with comparatively light hearts to a Conference for Naval Reduction, whereas we shall be treating with an element on which the continued existence of the Empire depends.The Admiralty is in agreement with the Chancellor that we should do all we can to encourage reductions by other Powers.    When we look at the new construction programmes of the U.3.A., Prance and Japan, we find that in cost they exceed or equal, our own to-day.    It is to be rioted that the last ten years have been marked by a determination on the part of other Powers to build up a modern fleet of the special types required , Whilst our programmes have been restricted, &quot;e have now to face:-(a) inferiority to the United Ptates in 8&quot; ships,(b) a ratio less than 5 to 3 with Japan in 8&quot; ships,(c) inferiority to Prance, J^pan and Italy in Flotilla Leaders,(d) inferiority to Japan and Prance in submarines, whilst as regards our 6-inch cruisers, though numerically superior to any other Power, as we must be, the large majority of them are war-time construction, of small size and gun-power, inferior speed, low radius of action and generally obsolescent.    In the last ten years the U.2.A. have built10 6-inch cruisers, J pan 14, 5.5-inch cruisers and this country 7 6-inch,    None of these seven was   laid down after
v/    PROPOSALS for THZ OOlJPSHSITCE.The Admiralty in putting forward their proposals for the Conference, have had to hear continuously in mind the foregoing considerations of security and the position of other Powers.The Treasury argument is that these proposals repre-sent an increase, not a decrease,  in the burden of our naval armaments, and in a table of estimates they endeavour to substantiate this.      A completely misleading impression is given by the table as it stands.    For one thing, in the last few years we have been anticipating only to a minor extent the replacement of our war-built fleet.    ^he time is now arriving when the war-built fleet will disappear rapidly, and a consequent increase in replacement is inevitable.    The Admiralty proposals are made with a view to reducing the burden. They represent a large decrease on what would be necessary under the provisions of the Washington Treaty for capital Ships and for other vessels if no agreement is reached.For example, no reference is made in the Treasury Memorandum to our commitment in regard to capital ships, namely, the laying down of:2 in 1931. 2 in 1932. 1 ill 19 33. 2 in 1934. 1 in 1935 2 in 193C.now is any acknowledgment made that the proposals suggested &quot;de novo&quot; by the Admiralty are designed to reduce this to 3 or 4 ships of a type SO/S less powerful and less.-.&apos; expensive.The Admiralty proposals,   if examined carefully, will be found to effect reductions in every category, namely,  small-er battleships,  smaller aircraft carriers,  smaller cruisers, fewer destroyers and fewer submarines.
The main-feature of the proposals of the Treasury is a suspension of all cruiser &quot;building programmes until 1932 and then to restart.Tli:- effect of such a proposal can hardly have been fully considered.      T&quot;e are invited still further to prejudice the labour situation i^1 our dockyards, to discharge large numbers of workmen, to lose many of our highly skilled employees, to increase our subsidies to armament firms and costs generally over the next two or three years, and then to restart construction.Steady programmes on the other hand,  as prepared by the Admiralty, will ensure economy with administrative efficiency.
VI.    THE TREASURY PROPOSALS.Turning to certain details in the Treasury proposals it is suggested that in regard to cruisers we should post-&apos; pone commencement of construction until 1932, that we should lay down 6 cruisers between 1932 and the end of 1936 and scrap 12 cruisers during that period.      This means that if we are to have 50 cruisers under 20 years of age built in 1939/40 we should have to lay down 20 cruisers in 1937.The further suggestion is made that the cruisers to be built should not exceed 4,500 tons standard dis-placement.     This question was very fully considered in the preliminary conversations with the Prime Minister.    We already have under our proposals no less than 19 of this type.    We are not in a position to build further a type which does not meet ocean requirements and is a smaller type than that which we know there is any possibility of the U.S.A., Japan and Prance agreeing to build.As regards destroyers the suggestion is made that starting in 1931 we should lay down 30 before 1936.      We should then have only 60 under 16 years of age, whilst Japan, if she built no more at all, would have 72.Turning to the purely technical question of raising the ages of all vessels the treasuryTs propasals cannot be entertained.      The Admiralty have gone to the limit in this respect, and as it is they have gone beyond the age limit which is acceptable to such Powers as Japan and Prance.    It is true that we did propose a possible age limit of 24 years for the newly constructed cruisers.    This was not. however, acceptable to others at the Geneva Conference in 1927 and we know that it is not acceptable to them now.
une other point deserves attention.    The Treasury refer to the building of 10,000 ton cruisers and seem to suggest that such building should never have commenced and should certainly not continue.    The Admiralty are inclined to agree but unfortunately this suggestion of the Treasury ignores realities.    Firstly, if the history of this matter is enquired Into it will be found that it was not the British Empire who started the 8&quot; cruiser competition but that Japan, U.S.A. and Italy were first in the field.        It v?as the duty of H.VI,Government and the Admiralty in view of the 3uilding Programmes of those Powers to take proper action to secure the position in regard to these ships.    It should also be rememberedthat the definite object of the British Delegates at the Geneva Conference in 1927 was to stop further building of 10,000 cruisers and to agree in regard to U.S.A. ourselves and Japan that we should be content with our numbers of 12,12 and 8.     Unfortunately, this did not command itself to the others.    The Japanese -Building Programme was continued with the object of reaching the figure 12 by 1932, the U.S.A. launched their proposals for a building programme of nothing but 10,000 ton cruisers;    we dropped/certain of our 10,000 ton cruisers from the programmes of 1927 and 1928 with the object of showing the others that even after the failure of the Conference we were really in earnest on this matter.    This had no effect, their programmes continued and subsequent efforts have simply been directed to ensure that we shall not get into a dangerous position in regard to Japan.
vii.   cohciusioIi.In pursuing these negotiations the general line taken by the Admiralty is that the- have taken note of the existing naval strength of the great Powers. They have estimated as far as they have been able the nature and amount of the reductions that they might agree to make.    They have set the example of declaring what reductions they are prepared to make now, and they have suggested that these reductions and those that other Powers may be- ready to effect shall be completed by the end of 1936.[Whilst hoping for substantial reductions in the strengths of other Powers it the London Conference, the Admiralty are of opinion that the cause of peace and economy will be more surely served if the proper assessment of maritime strengths is first made.    It will be all to the good of course that .these assessments should be on the lowest possible basis, and the British proposals are framed with that object.The proposals of the Treasury, if carried out, would undermine the naval position of the British Empire, and would make it impossible for the Admiralty to be responsible to H.LI.Government for the security of the sea communications or of the defence of our Dominions and Colonies against oversea attack.
