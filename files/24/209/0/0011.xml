THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1930.Copy No.    1CABINET.NEW HEBRIDES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.General.1. THE New Hebrides lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. They form an incomplete double chain of about 80 islands stretching in a north-north-west direction for a length of 550 miles.2. By a Convention of 1906, as superseded by a Convention of 1914, the New Hebrides are constituted a Condominium under the joint control of the British and French Governments. The Government consists for some purposes (e.g., customs, postal service, public health services) of a Condominium Service under the joint control of the British and French Resident Commissioners; for other purposes (e.g., police, district administration) of independent national services under the separate control of the respective Resident Commissioners.3. Corresponding to the different services in the New Hebrides exist different financial systems, viz. : (a.) The Condominium financial system, under which expenditure on the Joint Services is met by revenue raised from local taxation. In the event of an adverse balance, the British and French Governments are each responsible for one-half of the deficit.(&amp;.) Annual expenditure on the British Services in the New Hebrides met entirely from United Kingdom funds, the estimates for which are included annually in the vote for Colonial and Middle Eastern Services. The estimated expenditure for 1929-30 was  11,255; the estimated expenditure for 1930-31 is  11,323 (exclusive of provision for the proposals under discussion in this memorandum).(c.) Expenditure on French Services, which in 1927 was estimated at 2,274,000 fr. (about  18,350) and for 1928 at 5,140,000 fr. (approximately  40,000). The figures for 1929 or 1930 are not available in the Colonial Office.Political.4. The administration of the Group under the system of dual control has proved exceedingly difficult, and from time to time the question of ending the Condominium, either by (a) partition or (&amp;) exchange for territory elsewhere, has been examined. During 1926, following discussions at an Imperial Conference, the French Government were approached officially with a view to partition and rejected the proposal.5. It is true that up to the present serious friction between the two Govern-ments over New Hebrides affairs has been avoided, but it is equally true that the Condominium system gives rise to astounding complications, and is a severe trial of patience. Many of the affairs of the Group have to be discussed between London and Paris, which occasions irritating delays, and often leads to unsatisfactory decisions owing to the need for compromise between two conflicting views. Upon some matters of policy there is no accord between the two Governments, and it is to[20401] bSECRET. CP. 11 (30).
one such matter can be traced the recent important rise in French influence in the Group and the corresponding decline in British influence.6. The local labour supply being inadequate for the development of the Group, the settlers pleaded strongly for imported labour. The French Government decided to assist the French settlers by the introduction of large numbers of Tonkinese labourers, but His Majesty&apos;s Government have persistently rejected the appeals of the British settlers for Asiatic labour. The British settlers have thus been at a serious disadvantage as compared with their French competitors, with the result that there has been a rapid rise in French trade and influence in t,he Group and an equally rapid fall in British trade and influence.7. In April 1927, in view of the increasingly serious position of British settlers in the Group, a Commission of Enquiry, composed of representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand, visited the New Hebrides, with terms of reference as follows : &quot; To report upon the position of British settlers in the New Hebrides, with special reference to any disadvantage under which they may be working in comparison with French settlers, and, in particular, to consider (1) the provision of an adequate supply of labour for British settlers; (2) any further measures to assist British settlers in the production and marketing of their crops and to indicate what financial assistance, if any, would be required from the Government, whether by loan or otherwise, for carrying into effect any recommendation which the Commission may make.&quot;8. The Commission recommended the provision of an adequate supply at regular intervals of labourers from outside the Group, which they assumed would be effected by the introduction of Chinese labourers under contract.9. His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth and New Zealand intimated that they were prepared to support such a policy should His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom consider it necessary, but His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom decided (in June 1927) that they could not acquiesce in the introduction of Chinese labourers into the New Hebrides.10. Thereafter, the Commonwealth Government were consulted as to -whether they would be willing to assume responsibility for British interests in the New Hebrides. The Commonwealth Government replied that they did not see that the assumption by them of additional obligations in connection with the administration of the New Hebrides would assist in a solution of the difficulties and that, in their view, having regard to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards the labour question, renewed consideration should be given to the question of control of the Group, fresh negotiations being instituted with the French.11. In reply, the Commonwealth Government were informed that the difficulties inherent in the present system of dual control of the Group were fully realised, that the partition idea was proposed to and rejected by the French in * November 1926, and that there was no- reason to suppose that they would then (September 1927) view it with any greater favour. It was further stated that the only alternative to partition as a means of terminating the present system of dual control appeared to be an arrangement under which the British share in the control of the Group would be surrendered, subject to guarantees for the reasonable treat-ment of British settlers, traders and missionaries, in return for some territorial compensation elsewhere in the Pacific.12. The New Zealand and Commonwealth Governments and the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific were willing tbat the matter should ,be examined on this basis, subject in the case of the Commonwealth Government to a stipulation that negotiations should first be reopened &quot;with the French for a partition. There the matter has rested, with the British standing in the Group &quot;becoming steadily worse.13. The suggestion that the French Government should be again approached with a proposal for partition was not acted upon, as the then Secretary of fetate for Foreign Affairs (Sir Austen Chamberlain) did not consider the time for such a step to be opportune, dictated, as it was, by a state of affairs which was seemingly less
embarrassing to the French than to us. In his opinion, the step would court a certain second refusal and possibly also a snub. As to the alternative of an exchange, Sir Austen doubted whether the French Government would entertain even this, since, as they appeared already to have the matter in their own hands, His Majesty&apos;s Government would only be offering to sell to them what is to all practical purposes already theirs or is m process of becoming theirs. In this latter connection, Sir Austen presumably had in mind the consideration that many British settlers, unable to work their, plantations successfully without labour, were selling their holdings to French concerns.14. It is not my present intention to reopen the question of assisting the few remaining British plantations in the Group to obtain Asiatic labourers, nor to advise another approach to the French Government with a proposal for partition or exchange, but if both these matters be set aside, it is necessary to decide between the remaining alternatives of (a) British withdrawal from the Group, or (&amp;) continuance of the Condominium.15. Of these two alternatives I dismiss (a) on account of the deplorable loss of prestige which it would entail, even if fully satisfactory guarantees were secured for the reasonable treatment of the British settlers, traders and missionaries. It would not be safe to count upon a French readiness to offer anything acceptable in exchange, and the loss of prestige would, in my view, be out of all proportion to the savings to the Exchequer that might eventuate. Moreover, withdrawal from the Group could not be decided upon without the consent of Australia and New Zealand, and there is no ground for assuming that such a policy would be acceptable to either of them.16. If, then, the Condominium is to be continued, it is, in my view, important that the British side of the Administration shall be provided with the funds necessary to enable it to take a fitting share in the administration of the Group, and incidentally to make it plain (to the disheartened Britishers that have held on in the Group, to the natives, and to others) that His Maiesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom do not regard their interest in the Group as in any sense a diminishing one.17. There are two schemes for which I now desire to invite the support of my colleagues :  (a.) The provision of a vessel for the British Resident Commissioner. (&amp;.) The education of the natives.Vessel for Resident Commissioner.18. Up till 1928 the &quot; Euphrosyne,&quot; a steam yacht of about 170 tons, measuring 125 feet by 20 feet by 12 feet, had been available, but that vessel (built in 1889) was finally condemned as unseaworthy and disposed of. It was used by the Resident Commissioner to make tours of the Group necessary for the proper discharge of his duties and also to transport, as required, detachments of the British Constabulary in the New Hebrides. During the last 5 years of its use the average annual mileage of the yacht was 8,000. Expenditure in connection with the vessel was, of course, a charge on British funds. The cost of a new vessel (delivered in Vila) similar to the &apos;&apos; Eupnrosyne &apos;&apos; and in accordance with the specifications of the High Commissioner and the Resident Commissioner is estimated at  31,000, arrived at as follows : - Vessel delivered this country        ... ... ...      25,000Navigation to Vila (including insurance), say ...        4,000Incidental expenses, say ... ... ... ...        2,000..... ....... . r\ **   r\r\ s\.,.-!&apos;,.. . ..&apos;     .     .... HX,W\J19. The peculiar conditions obtaining in the New Hebrides require that transport facilities for the British Administration should fulfil the following conditions to be of value : (a.) They should enable the British Resident Commissioner or his deputy to proceed with despatch to places in the Group where his prerogative is required to investigate complaints.[20401] b 2
(b.) They should enable him to keep in touch with British residents and natives.(c.) They should enable him to co-ordinate the administrative work of dual control, a matter in which the British Resident Commissioner asserts that the French show little interest, and to keep himself well informed of the situation in the Group generally. It is essential, also, that he should have at immediate call a vessel which, in case of need, can be ordered to proceed without delay to any part of the Group with a detachment of the British police force. It follows that the vessel should be of such a size and strength as would permit use in any but the most severe weather experienced in the Group.20. The estimate of  25,000 is for a vessel providing, in addition to quarters for the officers and crew, accommodation for (a) the Resident Commissioner;(b) two other officials (say, the Commandant of Constabulary and a district Officer);(c) 20 native police;(d) 6 native prisoners.21. Communication between some of the islands is maintained by four steamers of 300 to 400 tons, which usually make monthly or 5-weekly tours, and have accommodation for a few passengers. These steamers, however, do not visit all the islands in the Group, and only one of them is run by a British Company Messrs. Burns, Philp and Co.22. It is obviously undesirable that the British Resident Commissioner should tour the Group in a French vessel If a Government vessel is not provided, the means of sea transport available for him would, therefore, be practically limited to the interinsular steamer of Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company. This would have very serious disadvantages. The visits of the Resident Commissioner would be substantially limited to the ports of call of that steamer and many of the outlying districts of the Group could not be visited. The times of his inspection of any district would be governed by the intervals of the visit of the steamer, his length of stay at any place by the length of sojourn of that ship, and, in short, all the circumstances of his tours of the Group would be dictated, not by administrative considerations, but by the commercial considerations of the Managers of the vessel.23. Enquiry has been made whether it would be possible by means of a subsidy to secure an augmented service of British inter-island steamers which would meet the requirements of the Resident Commissioner. In reply the Resident Commissioner pointed out that the inter-island vessels have no fixed itinerary and touch at places sufficiently long to transact business only. In consequence, residents have no opportunity to discuss matters with the Resident Commissioner, nor is there sufficient time to investigate complaints. Such Voyages, moreover, take a month, which is too long for the Resident Commissioner to be absent from Headquarters (having regard to the fact that little useful purpose would be served in the circumstances). Any sufficient augmentation of the services of the one British vessel would, he considered, hardly be possible; and even were it possible to arrange for the necessary adjustments in the service, tbe cost of such an arrangement would be out of all proportion to the services rendered.24. Representations are continually being made with regard to illicit traffic in liquor in the New Hebrides. Offenders are prosecuted whenever sufficient evidence can be obtained, but, owing to the isolated nature of the places in which many of these offences are alleged to take place, it is frequently difficult or impossible to secure such evidence. In connection with one recent complaint, it was pointed out that no British official had visited the island in question for about 2 years, when the late Resident Commissioner made a raid on one of the most notorious offenders and destroyed his stock of contraband grog.25. I am satisfied that on administrative grounds alone the case for the provision of a vessel for the British Resident Commissioner is clear, and that the delay in providing a vessel is diminishing the prestige, power and influence of the British Resident Commissioner and stultifying his administrative efforts.
26. I ask my colleagues, then, to endorse the policy of maintaining the British share in the conduct of the affairs of the New Hebrides Condominium, and, as a measure necessary in pursuance of that policy, to sanction the provision of a new vessel for the British Resident Commissioner.Native Education.27. There is at present also under consideration a scheme of Native Education. Briefly, the scheme takes the form of an annual subsidy of about  1,000 in aid of selected Mission Education Institutions in the New Hebrides and the establishment in or near Vila, at an annual cost of about  4,000 and an initial cost of about  10,000, of a British Government Training School, which would give to selected native pupils recruited from throughout the Group a course of training in general education and the manual crafts. The instruction it is contemplated would be carried out in English.28. At present, while the French Administration in the New Hebrides own and control a school in Vila open to children of all colours and nationalities, no educational work whatever is done by the British Administration in the New Hebrides. Such a situation, I consider, ill accords with the policy dictated by a sense of trusteeship and welfare of natives which is being pursued elsewhere in the territories under the control of this Government, and cannot fail to be a matter for reproach with those who have at heart the advancement of the natives.29. Apart from the question of native welfare, I feel that the present position of the British Administration in the matter, comparing as it does unfavourably with the work done by the French Administration, who maintain at least one school, might be interpreted by them, in the light of their knowledge of what is done elsewhere in the British Empire, as indicating only a passing interest in the New Hebrides by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Such an impression would be detrimental to the general policy which I wish to pursue. A scheme such as that under con-sideration would not only have the advantage of removing such a danger, but, by presenting in the Group an example of enlightened and beneficent administration, and by bringing into contact therewith natives who would be in a position to spread their impressions throughout the Group, would do much to enhance British influence there.30. It is estimated that a vote of  12,000 will be required to meet the cost during the financial year 1930-31 of this scheme, and I ask my colleagues to approve this expenditure also.P.Colonial Office, Downing Street, January 9, 1930/o
