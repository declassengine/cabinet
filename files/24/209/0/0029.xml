&quot;    211THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE&amp;TY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1930.SECRET. Copy No.     ^6CP. 30 (30).CABINET.AMERICAN CONTROL OF BRITISH INDUSTRIES.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Board ofTrade and the Minister of Transport.THERE have been a good many instances in recent years of the purchase of shares of British Companies by American interests for the purpose of securing control of the undertaking. Americans have a liking for foreign public utilities, and thus a good many examples are found in the electrical manufacturing industry, and especially in concerns managing electrical distribution. So far, the cases have been sporadic, and they bear witness to American prosperity and its surplus of capital for foreign investment, rather than to any consistent policy of capturing the management of British trade. The process differs, of course, from that by which we have in the past built up our external commercial power. British-owned foreign enterprises have in the main started in virgin territories, and have developed industries there by the use of capital raised from the. general investor. The American procedure, on the other hand, is that of group buying and group control of established British businesses conducted here or elsewhere. But this difference is sufficiently accounted for by the different commercial conditions in which the power of America has developed.We do not think that the process, so far as it has gone, has been injurious; in some instances it may have been very salutary. At the same time, with the increasing wealth of America, it may well be. that American investment aiming at the control of British businesses may become much more general, and it might suddenly raise an issue of great public importance, calling for immediate decision and action.We think that the question in all its aspects should be referred to the Economic Advisory Council.A memorandum dealing with the question in rather greater detail is attached.P. S. W. G. H.  M.January 30, 1930.Memorandum.1. THE late Government made some inquiry into this question so far as it affected the electrical industry. A Report upon it was furnished by the Committee of Civil Research. The main conclusions were that no objection could be taken on public grounds to purchases of British electrical shares by Americans for investment purposes, and, further, that no objection need be taken to American purchases on
their present scale for the purpose of obtaining control; but the Minister of Transport was directed to keep the matter under periodical review. The Terms of Reference, and the conclusions of the Committee, are set out in Appendix I.2. In conformity with these conclusions the Minister of Transport has had a memorandum prepared upon the subject, and this is printed in Appendix II.3. The following are instances of cases in which the control or the assets of British Companies have been purchased by American interests in recent times : The control of the Greater London and Counties Trust was acquired in February 1929 by the American Utilities Power and Light Corporation.An American Company has a substantial holding in the Mefropolitan-Vickers and British Thomson-Houston fusion.Whitehall Electric Investments, with a capital of  7^ million, sold its assets (situated in Chile and Mexico) to American interests in October 1928.A partial American financial interest in Graesser and Company, an important chemical undertaking in this country, has been converted into a hundred per cent, ownership by the Monsanto Chemical Works of St. Louis, U.S.A.4. So far as concerns British undertakings in South America and elsewhere abroad there can be little doubt that the advantage lies in retaining these interests if we are able to do so. Speaking generally, they provide a market for exports which would otherwise be lost. There is reason to believe, too, that the secret wishes of the South American States generally accord with our interests.5. As regards purchases of businesses operating in this country it is well to remember that the American interests usually pay a good price and that the large capital sums thus received by British shareholders are immediately available for investment in other enterprises here. There is every reason to think also that the introduction of American methods of management into industry in this country may in some instances be extremely salutary.6.   The main opposing considerations are as follows :  (a.) Export business might be diverted to the United States.(&amp;.) A business here controlled by a similar business in America might be starvedof work in order to provide more employment in America in the event ofa serious depression there, (c.) Research departments in this country might be closed down, and thiscountry to that extent denuded of an efficient research service. (d.) American technicians might come to be introduced in considerable numbersinto British businesses. (e.) If the concerns acquired are really important factors in national productionand therefore impossible to ignore in the preparation of plans for national defence in the event of war, the information as to such plans which reaches the managements would be passed on to Americanprincipals.7. But while these dangers can be visualised they have not so far been experienced.8. Real difficulty would be much more likely to arise if American interests sought to purchase the control of some vital industry, for instance, the great Banks, the great shipping firms, or the great armament firms. Public opinion would be likely to be stirred and some definite expression of policy from the Government would be demanded.9. Apart from the general question of public ownership, at least six methods of preventing the foreign control of a British Company have been canvassed : (a.) Restricting the right of persons other than British subjects to hold shares. (p.) Disfranchising shareholders who are not British subjects.
(c.) Giving the Directors of a Company the power to approve or disallow transfers.(d.) Limiting the number of votes that may be exercised by a single shareholder,including his nominees. (e.) Creating a voting trust.(/.) Limiting the Board of Directors to British subjects.There are various War precedents for the prohibition of the acquisition of certain kinds of property, and of the conducting of certain kinds of business, by foreign controlled companies. These provisions were the product of War conditions. If it were proposed that statutory restrictions should be imposed with this object in time of peace they would apparently have to be of much the same nature and it is unlikely that they would easily gain public assent. Whether it is necessary to have such powers in reserve and whether there are alternative means of avoiding such danger as there may be to essential British interests are matters which it is suggested require careful review.
APPENDIX I.THE terms of reference of the Civil Research Committee on Electrical Develop-ment and American Capital, set up in pursuance of a Cabinet decision of the 13th March, 1928, were as follows :  &quot;To examine the facts with regard to the, influx of American capital and control into electrical companies in this country, and to advise whether any undesirable consequences are to be expected especially in the form of orders for equipment being given abroad and whether any preventive measures can or should be adopted.&quot;The following is the Committee&apos;s summary of Conclusions and Recommenda-tions : s&quot; (i.) The influx of American capital into the British Electrical industry, either (a) for investment purposes or (b) for the purpose of acquiring control, does not appear at present to be large.(ii.) No objection can be taken on public grounds to purchases of British shares by Americans for investment purposes.(iii.) As regards the introduction of American capital for the purpose of obtaining control, no objection need be taken to American purchases on their present scale. It is unlikely that American control will result in orders for equipment being given in the United States by American-controlled companies, or that American engineers will be introduced by American-controlled companies. Further, the present difficulties in regard to electrical prices are not likely to be increased by the introduction of American control, as the trend of American policy is to aim at a small profit on a large turnover.In view, however, of possible developments, we recommend That arrangements should be made by the Minister of Transport to keep under periodical review (a.) The general question of the investment of American Capital in British Electrical Companies for the purpose of obtaining control.(b.) The particular question of the extent of the employment of American engineers, particularly in key positions, which might have an important bearing in the case of a national emergency.&quot;APPENDIX II.Memorandum by Sir Harry Haward on the Organisation and Structure of the Electricity Supply Industry, with particular reference to Company Undertakings and the Penetration of American Capital.Organisation of Supply.1. THE public supply of electricity in Great Britain, according to the latest published statistics (1927-28), is in the hands of 380 Local Authorities (including 4 Joint Boards representative of Local Authorities), 2 Joint Electricity Authorities and 254 Companies (including persons), making a total of 637, inclusive of the Central Electricity Board, all operating under Provisional Orders (now Special Orders) made by the Board of Trade (now the Electricity Commissioners) and confirmed or approved by Parliament, or under Special Acts. These supply authorities are termed &quot; Authorised Undertakers.&quot; The division of the supply business between Local Authorities and Companies is indicated in Annex A.2. These figures show that Local Authorities are responsible for the generation and sale of about two-thirds of the.whole Electricity Supply in Great Britain, and that the Companies undertake only about one-third of the total. These proportions have obtained for some years. For the purposes of this Memorandum the undertakings of Local Authorities need not be considered, as the cases of transfer of undertakings from public to private ownership have hitherto been few and unimportant, although the possibility of such transfers in the future cannot&quot; perhaps be altogether ignored. The aggregate capital expenditure of the Companies at the end of 1927 was  99,615,409.3. The Companies comprise (a) Distribution Companies (225), authorised to supply electricity for all public and private purposes within specified areas; (b) Power Companies (including the Central Company with bulk supply powers only) (29), which have been incorporated by Special Acts, and are
ISTotal       ... ... ...       86,156,896      100-0 per cent.The total capital raised by the end of 1929 has probably reached upwards of  95,000,000.11.   The average rate of dividend in 1927 was:  Preference ...... - ...     :    ... ...      5;72 per cent.Ordinary .....       ......      i   ....&quot;.     ... ... &quot;       .;.       7-52 per cent.Annex B gives an analysis of the rates of dividend on Ordinary share capital declared by individual Companies for 1927, together with a broad indication of the position in the case of Companies supplying electricity in that year whose returns did not show a dividend on Ordinary capital.In the majority of cases where dividends on Ordinary capital were declared the rates ranged -between 5 per cent, and 15 per cent.authorised under suoh Acts to supply electricity over large areas in bulk to authorised undertakers -and for power purposes, and for lighting where a: power j supply is given. They include certain hybrid Companies (i.e., the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire Electricity Company, the Bast Anglian Electric Supply Company, Limited, and the Wessex Electricity Company), who have recently&apos;obtained by Special Acts powers to supply over large areas similar to those of Power Companies, and who, in addition, are authorised to supply electricity for all public and private purposes in unoccupied areas, i.c, areas in respect of which there are no other authorised undertakers.4. The Distribution Companies&apos; areas of supply include the important areas of the two groups of London Companies and also a few large areas in the provinces, but,otherwise are relatively small. The Power and Hybrid Companies have wide areas &quot;of supply.5. The powers granted to the Distribution Companies by. their Orders may be. revoked in cases of default, but otherwise are granted in perpetuity, subject to an option to the Local Authority to purchase the undertaking at the end of 42 years and at recurring&quot; periods of 10 years on the terms laid down in the Electric Lighting Act, 1888, or in certain cases at earlier dates on terms prescribed by the Order. The undertakings of the Power Companies under their Special Acts are, however, not purchasable, but those of the Hybrid Companies referred to are purchasable at the end of 50 years on the basis of capital expenditure less depreciation.6. The public supply of electricity has become virtually, although not legally, a monopoly, as, generally speaking, it is not the practice to grant competing powers to authorised undertakers in the same area, although there are a few instances of overlapping powers. A certain amount of Government control is exercised over the undertakings in the interests of the public, as provided by the general Acts and the Orders under which the authorised undertakers operate. The control affecting the finances of undertakers relates to such matters as maximum prices chargeable, forms of account and official audit; the last named applies to Company undertakings only.7. The dividends of the Distribution Companies are not regulated or limited except (i) those of the London Companies as to their London areas which are controlled by the legislation and arrangements of 1925: and (ii) certain Companies with large areas of supply which have. recently obtained Special Orders under Section 39 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926. But under Section 32 of this Act it will be possible to place Distribution Companies, other than the Power Companies and the London Companies, under a Sliding Scale of Price and Dividend as soon as they commence to take a supply directly or indirectly from the Central Electricity Board, &quot;if, having regard to any -change in the cost of electricity, to the Company attributable to this Act,&apos;&apos; the Electricity Commissioners think it expedient; this will be done by Special Orders.8. The dividends of the Power Companies, although limited to standard rates plus sliding scale additions dependent on price reductions, are practically unlimited, owing to the large amounts still payable to make up deficiencies of past years in the standard rates of dividends allowed, although the Commissioners will be able by Special Order under Section 31 (2) of the Act of 1926 to repeal or limit the provisions for the payment of such back dividends when a Power Company commences to receive a supply from the Central Board.9. There is no control over the amount or mode of issue of capital in the case of the Distribution Companies other than the London Companies. In the recent settlement with the London Companies it was provided that those Companies should issue all new capital in the most advantageous form and on the best terms obtainable at the time of issue, such terms and form to be approved by the Commissioners, it being recognised that under the sliding scale arrangements, which form an integral part of the London scheme, the consumers have a direct interest in capital being raised as cheaply as possible. The amount of capital in the case of Power Companies incorporated by Act of Parliament is limited by their respective Acts. The raising of capital by both classes of Companies is not subject to the auction clauses which form such a familiar feature of Gas Company legislation.Companies&apos; Capital and Dividends. 10.   The capital raised by Companies at the end of 1927 stood as follows:  Loan (Debenture Stock, &amp;c.)    ... ...       32,011,012, or 37-2 per cent, of total.Preference      ... ... ... ... 17,472,435, or 20-3 per cent, of total.Ordinary        ....... ... 36,673,449, or 42-5 per cent, of total.
fciAssociation of Undertakings.12. Most of the Distribution Companies hold more than one Order, and some of them upwards of a score. The Companies have to fill up a separate statement of account in the prescribed form for each Order, but some latitude is allowed as regards certain details where the various undertakings are operated as one. There is a tendency in such cases to seek relief from the obligation to keep separate accounts.13. The tendency among electricity supply Companies to combine in some way or other has become more marked in recent years. Co-operation between authorised undertakers takes various forms.14. The most important forms of combination take place (i) through the medium of a finance or holding Company acquiring a control of authorised undertakings through the purchase of a majority of the Ordinary shares of the Companies; and (ii) by an authorised undertaker acquiring the shares of another authorised undertaking. It was not the practice of the Board of Trade, nor has it been the practice of the Electricity Commissioners, to concern themselves with the Companies, bodies or persons by whom the shares of an Electricity Company were subscribed or are held from time to time. The Commissioners have no official cognisance of any finance or holding Company. Broadly, it may be said that such Companies are not officially recognised; all official dealings and correspondence take place with the Companies to whom the Orders were granted, or who were incorporated by Special Acts, and who are responsible for carrying out the obligations contained in their Orders and Acts.15. The practical effect, of the more or less formal combinations or associations brought about in divers ways through the instrumentality of financial companies or otherwise is that a large number of the Company undertakings fall into various groups. In considering the possibility of a Trust Company, whether American or British, obtaining control over a number of supply undertakings, this grouping must obviously be considered.. Extent of Association between Com-pa-ny Undertakings.f 16. Annex C shows the grouping of the Company authorised undertakers at the present time, compiled from information contained in Burdetfs Stock Exchange Official Intelligence for 1929 and particulars obtained from Somerset House. The statistics as to capital raised and expended are as at the 31st December, 1927. This statement gives a complete picture of the extent of association between the Supply Companies and of control by Holding Companies, so far as known, but the position changes from month to month as further developments take place, either by the acquisition of share holdings or otherwise.17. Dealing first with the position in its broader aspects, it appears that out of 254 company undertakings, 81, with an aggregate capital expenditure of  10,599,000 (or 10-65 per cent, of the total), or, if the West End Group of London Companies be added, 92, with a total capital expenditure of  29,184,000 (29-30 per cent.), are operating independently.The principal groups showing a tendency to extend their operations are:  Capital PercentageExpenditure. of Total. Greater London and Counties Trust (including North             Metropolitan Electric Supply Company)            ...       11,410,064 11-45British Power and Light Corporation (1929), Ltd.     ...        2,785,649 2-80County of London Electric Supply Co., Ltd. ...          ...      14,957,899 15-01Midland Counties Electric Supply Co., Ltd. ...          ...        3,993,646 4-01Newcastle-on-Tyne Electric Supply Co., Ltd.           ...      11,985,300 1203iClyde Valley Electric Power Co.    ...          ...          ...        3,993,461 4-01Scottish Power Co., Ltd. ...          ...          ...          ...        2,231,397 2-2451-55American Capital.18. In considering the question of the extent to which American capital is now participating in the supply of electricity in Great Britain, and what further developments are possible or probable in this direction, The Greater London and Counties Trust, Limited, claims attention. This Company is financed by the Utilities Power and Light Corporation of Chicago. The- Trust Company was registered on the 27th July, 1925, under the name of The Greater London Trust, Limited, the title being changed in July 1926.19. This Holding Company is undoubtedly the most active in- extending its operations of control. It first acquired control of Edmundsoh&apos;s Electric Supply Corporation, itself largely a Holding Company controlling many supply undertakings, some of which in their turn control others. This was followed by other acquisitions. It has recently secured a substantial interest.of the Clyde Valley Power Company by the purchase of blocks of shares to the extent of 800,000 out of the 2,000,000 Ordinary shares of that Company. The significance of this investment is not apparent, as the Scottish Company is remote from the major sphere of the Trust&apos;s operations. During 1929 the important undertaking of the Shropshire, Worcestershire and Staffordshire Power Company, with its group of subsidiaries, has been brought under the control of the Trust. This Power Company has recently come to an agreement with the Hereford Corporation to purchase the Municipal Electricity Undertaking which comprises the Borough of Hereford and a large Rural area surrounding it. This Power Company is active in prospective developments westwards. Close relations are believed to exist between it and the West Gloucester Power Company.Rumours were current at one time as to the acquisition by the Trust of interests in other important Power Companies, as well as in other undertakings.
20. A study of the map oi the controlled Companies&apos; areas of supply shows that the Trust&apos;s principal field of&apos; operations now consists of two solid blocks of territory (i) extending on the south from the Isle of Wight to the western confines of Dorset, and runningalmost due north to the borders of Worcestershire with an important stretch of country in Gloucestershire and to the north-west including Herefordshire; and(ii) the Counties of Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, the greater part of Suffolk and part ofNorfolk.Forming a wedge between these two regions is the area of the Northamptonshire Electric Supply Company, with its subsidiary concerns. It lias been rumoured that there have been negotiations for the acquisition b3&apos; the Trust of this concern. The advantages to the Trust of securing this intervening territory are obvious. There is also a proposal made by one of the Trusfs Companies to the Corporation of Peterborough to purchase their undertaking outright. The acquisition of this key station by the Trust would tend further to consolidate their position in the district, but nothing is known of the result of the negotiations.21. The Trust now controls 53 Companies, and has some arrangement for a term of years with the North Metropolitan Power Company. Particulars of these Companies, showing how they are controlled by the Trust, are given in Annex D.22. In considering the financial possibilities of developments by the Trust through these Companies, it must be borne in mind that the areas comprised in the Power Company undertakings, directly or indirectly controlled, although extensive, are mostly rural in character, and, in the absence -of industrial developments, may be regarded as &quot; thin &quot; from the financial point of view. Several of the distribution undertakings are of considerable magnitude, but two of them (Twickenham and Oxford) will be purchased by the Local Authority under notices recently given; many of them are quite small and isolated. The Annual Eeport of the Utilities Power and Light Corporation (year 1928) indicates to the American public the view the Company take of their prospects and potentialities (see extract in Annex F).Outside the possibility of constructing a generating station, any extension of the Trusfs activities beyond the development of the undertakings already acquired can only take place as the result of acquiring further undertakings.23. None of the Companies controlled by the Trust at present possesses a large generating station likely to become a selected station under a scheme adopted by the Central Electricity Board. When the National Grid has been established, all the concerns in question will take their energy in bulk from the Board&apos;s system. It will be open to any authorised undertaker controlled by the Trust to apply to the Commissioners under Section 11 of the Act of 1919 for consent to erect a large generating statien, but, if such a station is to be a selected station, it must have been included in a scheme adopted by the Central Electricity Board, and be provided by an authorised undertaker 5n whose area of supply, or in the neighbourhood of whose area of supply, any new generating station required by a scheme is to be situated.24. A proposal has been put forward tentatively on behalf of the Trust for the erection of a super-power station &quot; by or through the medium of an authorised undertaker on a site on Southampton Water. The consent of the Commissioners would have to be obtained under Section 11 before such a station could be erected, and, what is more important, the station would have to be included as a selected station in a scheme adopted by the Central Electricity Board. In the scheme for South-West England and South Wales, transmitted on the 30th December last by the Electricity Commissioners to the Central Board, there is provision for a new selected station on Hampton Water or other waterside side in the south-eastern part of the area for operation by the winter of 1938-39. If and when the scheme is adopted by the Board, the latter body could tu--.u, under Section 6 of the Act, make arrangements with an authorised undertaker (e.g., the Wessex Company), not with the Trust, for the provision of the station. It is obvious, therefore, that the Commissioners and the Central Electricity Board have complete control over the erection ci such a station by whomsoever proposed.25. The owners of selected stations are under statutory obligations to operate them in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1926, and to sell to the Central Electricity Board all the electricity generated thereat at virtually cost price, which includes remuneration of capital at the average rate of dividends and interest paid by the Company during the preceding year, but not less than 5 per cent, or more than 6-i per cent.26. The Trusfs Balance Sheet as at the 30th September, 1929, will be found in Annex E. It shows that the Trust has an authorised share capital of  1,750,000, of which  1,200,000 has been issued in  1 shares. Of these shares, 1,196,496 are held by Sir Philip Dawson, M.P., Mr. William May and Mr. Massingberd Rogers jointly (presumably as nominees of the Utilities Power and Light Corporation of America), in addition to 500 separately held by them as qualifying shares. The other shareholders are Lord Birkenhead, Sir Austen Chamberlain, Lord Meston and Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, each holding 500 qxialifying shares, and 4 holders of one shai-e each. The assets of the Company consist mostly of investments, namely:  .,Shares in subsidiary companies at cost ... ... ...       5,969,220andSundry investments at cost     ... ... ... ...  458,216which have been provided by the issue of 1,200,000 Ordinary  1 shares, and the balance by loans. Under its Memorandum and Articles of Association the Trust can borrow up to five times the nominal amount of its issued share capital. This method of finance enables the Trust to provide itself with large funds at a moderate average cost in interest and dividend, and to obtain control over a number of important undertakings by the issue of a comparatively small amount of share capital.
27. The operations of the Company as shown by the Profit and Loss Account have resulted in a profit up to date of  13,672 (profit for 1928-29,  38,188, less loss for 1927-28,  24,516). The Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with Section 129 of the Companies Act, 1929 (see-certificate dated the 26th November at foot of the balance sheet), but it will be noted that it does not disclose any details with regard to the operations of the subsidiary companies.Effect of Employment of American Capital.28.   A short reference may be made to the participation of American capital in the construction of the Tube Railways of London started in December 1900.Prior to 1900 certain statutory Companies had obtained powers from Parliament for the construction of underground railways, but had experienced great difficulty in raising capital for these novel and expensive undertakings, particularly at a time when the money markets in this and other-countries were suffering from the effects of the Boer War.Mr. Yerkes approached Messrs. Speyer Bros., and the Underground Electric Railways Company,. Limited, was formed in 1902 with a capital of  5,000,000. This was raised in three financial centres, namely, Speyer Bros, of London, Speyer and Company of New York, and the Old Colony Trust Company of Boston. These firms were to nominate a majority of the Board of Directors for a period of not less than ten years, and for some years half of the Directorate hailed from the United States. These firms and their associates raised all the capital required for the construction of the Tube-Railways. A notable instance was the issue of  7,000,000 of Profit-Sharing Notes subsequently converted into 6 per Cent. Income Bonds. In more recent years the operations of the controlling limited company have greatly extended. The directorate has completely changed and no longer contains United States members.29. The whole position as it then stood was the subject of evidence before the Royal Commission on London Traffic (1903-05), who reported (paragraph 151):  &quot; We believe that amalgamation can be carried out in such a way as to be profitable to the shareholders, and advantageous to the public, but we think that it should only be sanctioned on terms and conditions ivhich fully secure the interests of the public.&quot;The two main grounds on which the London Traffic Combine was justified were (1) the necessity for a unified management of the railways in the metropolitan area, and (2) the difficulties experienced by the statutory companies in raising capital.30. In that case there was the greatest difficulty in obtaining capital in this country for these enterprises, and there is no doubt whatever that the employment of American capital facilitated the construction of the Tube Railways in London, and it is a question whether in the result any national interest was prejudiced; certain American engineers were brought over at the time to assist in the construction of those railways, and it may be that some American engineers are still employed in their operation.It cannot be said that in regard to Electrical enterprises in this Country there is any difficulty in obtaining British capital. The main argument advanced by the Trust for American capital is that it is cheaper.31.   Apart from any genera1 observations applying equally to British as to American controlled Trusts in the electricity supply industry, the following appear to be the directions in which it suggested that American control may operate disadvantageously in the national interest:  (1.) The supply of American plant and apparatus. The Commissioners have no knowledge of any heavy generating plant having been supplied by the United States to authorised undertakers in this country, nor do they think it probable that such plant will be supplied in future, unless conditions radically alter, owing to the high wage standard in the States, and to-the United States frequencies being 60 and 25 as against our standard 50. It is believed that the supply of American apparatus is confined to domestic apparatus in the shape of irons, ovens, fittings and small articles.(2.) The employment of American engineers or other staff. The Commissioners have no knowledge of any American Engineers having been employed by authorised undertakers (municipal or company) in this Country.32. The following is an extract from a statement made by Lord Birkenhead, on behalf of the Trust, which appeared in the &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; of the 15th February, 1929:  &quot; The organisation with which I have decided to associate myself is British, although it is associated with the Clarke interests in the United States. Its Board of Directors is, and will remain, British, and it is not tied to any manufacturing organisation. It is not interested in any respect in the purchase of American or other foreign materials or machinery, and its purchase will result in the employment of British material and labour, and its entire staff is, and will remain, British.&quot;33. It may be added that if the participation of American capital leads to more enterprising methods in the development of electricity supply in this country, such a result must obviously be an advantage. Although there does not seem to be any difficulty nowadays in obtaining British capital for sound electrical enterprises, it may be doubted whether the Boards of certain Companies have not hitherto adopted a too conservative policy in regard to developments. In the interests of the National Grid Scheme and of the community generally, it is most desirable that an energetic and progressive policy should be adopted by all undertakers, particularly those who are responsible for rural areas. .
Summary.34.   The principal points in this Memorandum may be summarised as follows:  (1.) Two-thirds of the whole of the electricity supply in Great Britain is undertaken by&quot; local authorities and one-third by Companies.(2.) The Companies (254 in number) comprise Distribution Companies, Power Companies and certain Hybrid Companies, and, like the local authorities, have a practical, though not legal, monopoly of supply in their respective areas; their finances are subject to Government control in the matter of maximum prices, forms of account and audit, but not, generally speaking, as regards the amount of their dividends or capital arrangements.(3.) The total capital raised by the Companies at.the end. of ,1927, stood at  86,156,896 (capital expenditure  99,615,409); ;.the average dividends paid were 5:72.per cent, on the Preference shares and 7-52-per cent, on the Ordinary shares.(4.) The Companies have tended, especially, in recent years, to combine or associate through the medium of a Finance or Holding company or otherwise, with the result that out of the 254 Companies only 92, with a capital expenditure of  29,184,000, or 29-3 per cent, of the total, are operating independently..(5.) The Holding Company most active in extending its controUing operations is the Greater London and Counties Trust, Limited, financed by the Utilities Power and Light Company of Chicago. It controls 53 companies, with an aggregate capital expenditure of  7,714,413, or 7-74 per cent, of the total. The Trust&apos;s Balance-Sheet at the 30th September, 1929, showed an issued share capital of  1,200,000 with a loan indebtedness of nearly four and a half times that amount; up to that date the profit shown was  13,672; it has been publicly stated that the Trusfs Board of Directors will remain British; that it is not tied to any manufacturing concern; and that its entire staff is, and will remain, British.(6.) The introduction of American capital in the Supply Industry is not, so far as the Electricity Commissioners can judge, likely to lead to placing by authorised undertakers of Orders for heavy generating plant in the United States, unless conditions radically alter; the supply of American apparatus is mostly confined to domestic articles.(7.) If the participation of American capital leads to more enterprising methods in the develop-ment of electricity supply in this Country, it must obviously be an advantage, as, in the interests of the National Grid Scheme and of the community generally, it is most desirable that an energetic and progressive policy should be adopted by all undertakers, particularly those responsible for rural areas.H.

Annex F.Utilities Power and Light Corporation and Subsidiary Companies.Extract from Annual Report for Year ended December 31, 1928.FOE a number of years your Company has been interested in the development of the electric light and power industrial-y in Great Britain. It now announces its ownership of The Greater London and Counties Trust, Limited, which owns the entire capital stock (except directors&apos; qualifying shares) of several electric companies in Great Britain and a substantial interest in others. The Earl of Birkenhead, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1919 to 1922, and Secretary for. India from 1924 to 1928, is Chairman of the Board of The Greater London and Counties Trust, Limited. Under authority of Acts of Parliament, the subsidiaries of The Greater London and Counties Trust, Limited, furnish electricity in three large &quot;areas&quot; adjoining the City of London and extending east, west, south and north. The line extensions and developments necessary to supply electrical energy in these areas will require in the next five years a minimum expenditure of  10,000,000, or approximately 50,000,000 dollars. The British Companies and their subsidiaries serve exclusively 95 cities and towns in England and Scotland with electricity. The territory served includes large manufacturing centres, being largely within a 100 mile radius of the City of London, and the use of electric energy in these cities is increasing at twice the rate of its increase in corresponding American communities. The areas controlled include approximately 9,300 square miles with a population in excess of 2,000,000. The Greater London and Counties Trust, Limited, is co-operating with several governmental bodies and industrial associations in furthering the employment of labour and the electrification of industry.The Greater London and Counties Trust, Limited, owns a substantial interest in one of the largest statutory companies supplying electricity in the metropolitan and suburban area of London. Among the subsidiaries of The Greater London and Counties Trust, Limited, are the following companies:  Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire Electricity Company, which was incorporated in December 1925, by an Act of Parliament which authorises the Company to provide, without competition, a supply of electricity for all purposes in an area of about 1,200 square miles situated in the Counties of Cambridge, Huntingdon, Bedford and the Isle of Ely, for a period of fifty years, which under certain conditions may be extended for additional periods of fifty years each. This Company is also authorised to supply electricity wholesale to any local authority, company or person supplying electricity within any area adjoining the area of supply. The Company obtains its supply of electricity from the North Metropolitan Electric Power Supply Company and from the Bedford Corporation. The Greater London and Counties Trust, Limited, owns a substantial interest in the North Metropolitan Electric Power Supply Company. In December 1927, by a Special Order, the Company was authorised to construct a generating station at Little Barford in Bedfordshire. This station has been designated as a &quot; selected station &quot; under the Electricity Supply Act, 1926, for the :South-East England Electricity Scheme by the Central Electricity Board.Cookham and District Electricity Comporation, Limited, which is a private company operating under Special Orders which give it the right to supply electricity in the parishes of Woburn, Little Marlow and Hedsor in the. rural district of Wycombe and the urban district of Marlow, all in the County of Buckingham, and parts of the parishes of Cookham and Bisham in the rural district of Cookham in the County of Berks. The towns in the area are suburbs of the City of London. The Company operates its own generating plant and also receives current wholesale from the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited.The East Anglian Electric Supply Company, which operates under an Act of Parliament dated the 29th -July, 1927, that gives it the right to supply electricity for all public and private purposes and authority to supply electricity wholesale to any authorised distribution companies, in a large area in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. An important scheme of development in these counties based upon the wholesale supply of electricity from the Central Electricity Board under the Electricity Supply Act, 1926, has been prepared and submitted to the Electricity Commissioners for approval. The area controlled by this Company contains manufacturing towns, agricultural districts and pleasure resorts.Edmundsons&apos; Electricity Corporation, Limited, which was registered the 7th April, 1897. This Corporation, through subsidiaries, has acquired concessions for central station lighting in forty-five cities and towns. The Corporation does the electric light and power business in the Isle of Wight and the Isls of Guernsey. It also contracts for electrical installations. The Corporation generates a supply of electricity in twenty-two steam-driven plants. One of the principal steam plants supplies electricity wholesale to a group of large tin mines in the famous Cornwall District and also to several tin-plate mills. Subsidiaries of this Corporation furnish electricity for manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and for large private estates and summer and winter resorts. This Corporation also holds a controlling interest through ownership of ordinary shares in the Cambridge Electric Supply Company, Limited, operating at the seat of Cambridge University   .Oxford Electric Company, Limited, which was registered on the 24th August, 1891, receives its power under various electric lighting orders which authorise a supply of electricity in the City of Oxford, the seat of Oxford University, and a number of parishes in &quot;the rural districts of Culliam, Heddington and Woodstock. The Company owns a modern steam generating plant situated in the heart of the city and a comprehensive distribution system. The Company has entered into an agreement to furnish electricity wholesale to the Wessex Electricity Company.Wessex Electricity Company, which was incorporated by an Act of Parliament er .dd on the 29th July, 1927, and received further powers by an Act of Parliament of the 3rd August, 1928,
authorising the Company to generate and supply electricity within denned areas in the Counties of Oxford, Bucks, Berks, Southampton, Wilts and Gloucester and in certain cases beyond those areas -and to supply tramways, &amp;c, and to sell electricity wholesale to other authorised distribution companies. The territory in which the Company has the right to operate borders on suburban London to the west and south extending nearly to the Severn River on the west and to the English Channel on the south, and includes many manufacturing towns and an extensive agricultural district. The growth of London, particularly from a manufacturing standpoint, is largely to the west and into this area. The Company has contracted to take a supply of electricity wholesale from Oxford Electric Company, Limited.Western Electricity Supply Company, Limited, which was registered as a private company the 5th November 1903, as Western Electric Distributing Corporation, and converted to a public company in January 1923, at which time the title was changed as above. The Company owns or controls electric lighting companies operating in sixteen cities and towns in the Counties of Oxford Berks Wilts and Gloucester, and also through West Wilts. The Company owns its own generating&apos;stations in various towns. &quot;
