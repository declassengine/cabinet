THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.I attach a memorandum by the Attorney-General whioh sets out very clearly certain points relating particularly to overtime and the position of the railways, on whioh a decision by the Cabinet ia necessary before further progress can be made.     She Secretary of State for the Dominions, the President of the Board of Trade and I concur in the terms and proposals of the memorandum.I ask the Cabinet to approve these proposals and to authorise me to consult the Trades Union Congress General Council privately on the railway question, with a view to their obtaining the agreement of the railway unions to the proposal about railways, in order to enable the Government to proceed on lines compatible with ratification of the Washington Hours Convention.At a later stage it will be necessary, before the Bill can be introduced, to consult the Trades Union Congress and &quot;uhe Employers&apos; Confederation on the Bill as a whole.It will not therefore be possible to introduce the Bill on the 25th February, the date previously fixed by the Cabinet, but, if I can be authorised now to proceed on the lines now proposed, the Bill should be ready for introduction in March.CP.26(30),SECRETHOURS OF IjJiXISSBIAX employment BILL.CABINET.(Intd. ) M.

(objectTHISfPATIPICATION lOF THE PASHIKGTOW JQ1TCENEM.JOKSTIiEUTES JIKLCATION,HOURS OF INDUSTRIAL EMPIrOMEMT BILL. Memorandum by the Attorney General.I have been asked from time to time to take part in the discussions which have arisen in connection with the Hours of Employment Bill,,   and I have been the meditan throtigh which instructions have been passed on to the Parliamentary 33raftsman in charge of the Bill;   but a point has now arisen with regard to which I must have definite instructions which I can pass on to the Draftsman to make it possible for him to prepare a Bill.       I have therefore prepared this memorandum at the request of the Minister of Labour.     It is, I fear, lengthy and somplicated.     The point is one of great importance, and the time has come when definite instructions must be given.It will be remembered that the Government is committed to ratifioation of the Washington Convention.A good deal of misconception exists as to what constitutes ratification.     Ratification is an execu-tive act which in itself requires no legislation at all. Indeed, an absolute monarch would require no legislation. A Government such as ours, whish is within the law and controlled by Parliament, must however seek legislative powers to enable it to make its ratification effective.I would point out that it is quite unnecessary for all the legislative powers to be contained in one Bill.     If, for instance, miners2 hours are regulated by the Goal Bill, miners can be omitted from the Hours of Employment Bill.
SUBJKCi Of thi 8commercial ovj&amp;time the D,&apos;I?ort.jlntQuestion.EXPLMATIOII01 !i!HB ivERM &quot;COMMERCIAL OV .-iffii:lME&quot;.It will be necessary to consider the terms of the Washington Convention, the eircumstances under which it was passed, and the construction which would be put upon the Convention if legislation in identical terms were passed in this country, and to consider whether a similar construction will be placed on such legislation in foreign countries.The fundamental question on which instructions must be obtained is as to whether or not commercial overtime is to be allowed to any, and, if so, to what extent.The Employers in a memorandum they have presented explain what they mean by the phrase &quot;commercial overtime&quot; as follows:-&quot;Commercial overtime is a normal incident in the industrial life of any country and may arise from a variety of causes.-    There are the ordinary oaseo to meet pressure of orders resulting either from arbitrary or seasonal causes;    the meeting a contract date,  so often vital in foreign competition; coping with conditions of weather and tides and other natural forces;    keeping one department going a little longer in order to prevent the other departments in the next process from having to wait on its materials, i.e., balancing the general production in the works;    carrying through to oomple-tion processes whose duration cannot be accurately determined in advance;    working on to complete a course of treatment where the materials are subject to rapid deterioration etc.,    etc., apart altogether from the necessity of carrying on in the temporary abuence of staff owing to
1)1 LEMMA 201ERCIAL SEME.NOS I OHA .7AGE3 i MJ) AH&apos; &quot;3 BILL.&quot;Occasional siokneas, and meeting the case of some members of an oncoming shift;-being late and members of the previous shift having to carry on until they are relieved etc.&quot;The employers add:    &quot;It is sometimes argued that commercial overtime is unnecessary in that the work can be met by taking on more staff, but we feel you will appreciate that we cannot, as a business proposition, go out into the market and find understudies to complete the week&apos;s work : whenever we happen to need them, or, alternatively, maintain a casual staff of understudies as against the need for them arising.&quot;One has only to contemplate workshop practice, as it exists, to realise how impracticable it is in many industries to release the man or squad of men which is completing a certain job and replace them by a new squad of men&quot;.On the one hand, if commercial overtime is prohibited by law, if the only circumstances under which industry may exceed the normal period of 48 hours are such oases as accident or force majeure, it will be said that we are putting industry into a strait waistcoat, seriously impeding the recovery of our export trade, and placing our manufacturers under a grave handicap in competing for foreign orders.     On the other hand, it will be said - and I propose to examine the truth of the allegation - that if we allow commercial overt-ime we are failing to honour the Washington Convention, but are bringing in legislation which conflicts with it.In considering the V/ashington Convention it is essential, in the firot instance, to bear in
mind the distinction between a Bill to fix hours and a Bill to fix wages.     A Bill whioh says that, after working 48 hours a week, a man shall be entitled to receive overtime rates for any additional work he does, without placing any limit on the extent to which he may work, would be a Vfeges Bill.     An Hours Bill, on the other hand, is a Bill whioh fixes a maximum number of hours beyond which a man may^work, quite regardless of the rate of pay which he may receive.     This distinction is of course, obvious.     Bat between these two extremes there may be Bills whioh start by being Hours or Wages, as the case may be, but become so whittled down by exceptionsthat it is difficult in the end to tell into whioh of the-two classes such Bill falls.HH&amp;1I3H Foreign courts in oonstruing the Convention wouldANON 3 03?0KSTRUC2ION   have regard not only to the words of the Convention itself,IIFSER Hi CMuKEIGN but also to all the discussions that took place, in ordergaONS OPiONSTRUCTION. that they might ascertain the sense in which the words were used.An English oourt in construing the Convention, or in construing a statute drawn in synonymous terms, would have regard merely to the language of the Convention or statute, and disregard all other considerations, even although it was plain that the words were intended to be used in some sense other than that whioh they bear.It will therefore be necessary, in considering the construction whioh would be placed upon the Washington Convention by a -foreign court, to consider not only the terms of the Convention but also the oiroumetanoes under whioh the Convention came to be accepted.
The Washington Convention is in part an Hours Bill and in part a Sages Bill.      By Article 2 there is imposed a daily limit of 8 hours and a weekly limit of 48 hours; but at the same time over-time is provided for in certain events, and the rate of pay for overtime is fixed at If times the regular rate.The cases in which these specified limits may be exceeded under the Washington Convention are as follows:-(1) By agreement between employers&apos;  and workers organisations or representatives        in accordance with custom the daily limit of 8 hours may be moved up to 9 hours so long as the weekly limit remains unaltered. If, therefore a worker works 9 hours for 5 days in the week and 3 hours on Saturday the employer of such worker  -would be,within the Convention. &apos;(2) The Limit of hours, whether weekly or daily, may be exceeded in cases of accident or urgent work to be done to machinery or p^ant.(3) The  limits are increased up to 56 hours a week on the average in processes to be carried on continuously by a succession of shifts.(4) In exceptional cases, particularly seasonal trades-, a longer limit daily and weekly may by agreement between employers&apos;  and workers&apos;  organisations be worked during one period of the year if compensated for by a shorter limit during another period so that the weekly average over both periods does not&apos; exceed 48.(5) Finally, there comes the all-important qualifications comprised in Article 6 of the   Vashington Convention, which contemplates that regulations may be made to determine  (a) the permanent exceptions that may be allowed in preparatory or complementary work, and  (b) the temporary exceptions that may be allowed so that establishments may deal with exceptional cases of/pressure
pressure of work.     Those regulations are to fix the maximum of additional hours in each instance.My predecessors in this office and many distinguished lawyers have advised that an English Court would hold that commercial overtime was not within Article 6 and was, therefore, prohibited.      I am not prepared to dissent from this view, though I would point out that the Article is drafted in such an ambiguous way that I do not believe it possible to assert positively what view a court would take of it.The Article (which in both its French and English texts is set out in Annexe 1 to this memorandum) contemplates 1 two classes of exceptions to the rigidity of the 48 hours rule (a) permanent exceptions and (b) temporary exceptions.      It contemplates that regulations shall be made to fix the maximum of additional hours &quot;in each instance&apos;1.      It is impossible to say whether this means In each of the two cases or in every single case in which any establishment or industry avails itself of the right to work overtime.The clause as to temporary exceptions relates to exceptional cases of pressure of work.     The corresponding French text could be as accurately rendered by the phrase &quot;Iw^aaaa&amp;as of work beyond the normal&quot;. It is obvious that this phrase might lead to a very different result.      Both texts are equally authoritative.There are some other respects in which it is clear that the English text does not correspond with the French text;   and one of these differences, namely, the use of the words &quot;exceptional cases of pressure of work&quot; instead of the words &quot;cases of exceptional
pressure of work&quot; has been pointed out by the Employers. OF The Convention was settled at the first meeting ofNGTON the International Labour Conference which took place between&quot;ition.the 29th October and 29th November, 1919.   No  English lawyer was present to assist or advise as to the drafting. The Organising Committee presented a Report for the consideration of the Conference.      This draft provided that overtime  (which would include commercial overtime) might be worked for 15 0 hour in the year so long as the rate of pay for such overtime was 25% more than the normal.      The Report of the Organising Committee provided that in certain industries the permissible overtime should -after 5 years be reduced to 100 hours per year in place of the 150 hourso      This Report came up for consideration at the - 6th session.     Mr. Barnes moved that this draft Convention be adopted    by the Conference as the basis for discussion.      In the course of his speech dealing with this particular matter he said; &quot;There are those I know who regard this Convention that has been framed for us as not sufficiently elastic and who feel that it must be improved by making provision for larger amount of overtime or by provision for large discretion being left to the national body.    Those views must somehow or other be brought together and that is a matter for friendly discussion afterwards&quot;.   Mr.Marjoribanks    (British Employers) desired that alternative    proposals should be considered at the same time as the draft Convent ion.His proposals were to define the working-day as a period of actual work and to allow overtime up to 300 hours a year. The workers, on the other hand, moved in effect that no commercial overtime  (apart from an allowance for seasonal trades) should be allowed at all.
Finally the draft Convention and the proposed amendments submitted by the Employers and the Workers were referred to a Commission to be appointed, for consideration and report.     Such Commission was then constituted and included Mr, 3arnes  (representing the Government). Mr.Marjoribanks (representing the I*!mployer3 ) and Mr, Shaw (representing the Workers&quot;).    So far as I know no Report of its deliberations exists.      Finally, however, it presented to the Conference a Convention of which Article 6 was accepted without further amendment, and which, after slight alteration in form by the drafting committee, became the final Convention.     In theReport of the Commission dealing with Article 6 it is stated that:    &quot;in the same spirit the same Sub-Committee drew up a compromise text relating to hours of work,etc.&quot;Under these circumstances, it seems to me quite plain that no foreign court would construe Article 6 asprohibiting commercial overtime.     An argument upon the following lines would be to such a court absolutely conclusive;.  &quot;The Organising Committee put forward a proposal allowing commercial overtime to the extent of 150 hours a year.      The workers demanded no commercial overtime and the employers demanded 500 hours.      The matter was referred to the Commission and a compromise text was agreed upon.      It would, therefore, be manifestly wrong to construe this clause so as to prohibit commercial overtime altogether&quot;.
QXD THE ALLOW- If It is decided to allow commercial overtimelC3 OF COMMERCIAL33TIME CONFLICT   and If we are, as a result, attacked upon the groundItf THE ipVSNTION? that we have thereby departed from the Convention,we shall therefore be able to 3ay;(1) The letter of the Convention is ambiguous and it Is doubtful whether we are carrying that out or not j   but(2) We are clearly honouring the spirit of the Convention and reproducing it In our own domestic legislation In the sense in which it would be understood by foreign countries;   and(3) That the International Labour Office take the view that legislation so drafted would carry out the provisions of the Convention;    and(4) That the London Conference, 1926, agreed that the maximum limit to the number of additional hours that might be worked under Article VI (6) was to be within the competence of national law.     This seems to contemplate the existence of commercial overtime regulated in the case of each particular country by its own Government,      It must, of course, be admitted that the conclusions of the London Conference do not vary the Washington Convention;   but it will be difficult for a Conservative opposition to criticise an Interpretation sanctioned by their own Minister of Labour.IBLE SOLUTIONS One solution which has been suggested is thatHIS PROBLEM,commercial overtime be allowed, but that the Minister be given power to cut down such overtime if it appears that its extent is unreasonable.I understand that the International Labour Office feels considerable doubt as to whether this would be in
aooord with any possible construction that could be given to Article 6, since this Article provides in terms that regulations are to fix a maximum of additional hours in each instance.     Moreover, a Bill drafted on these lines would defeat our main object, whioh is that other countries in the light of our example may introduce legisla-tion to improve the conditions under which their work is carried on.Under legislation so drawn everything would depend upon administration, and a backward country could readily pass suoh legislation and yet, by failing to take any administrative action, ooiild render it wholly nugatory.Personally, if commercial overtime is to be allowed, I should prefer legislation which placed a limit on the amount of suoh overtime (say 30 hours in four weeks) and provided that if necessary the Minister might by regula-tions applying to classes of industry authorise a limitation ?r extension in accordance with agreements which may be concluded between workers1 and employers&apos; representatives,I understand that the International Labour Offioe would be prepared to express the view (and to allow us to quote it in the debates) that legislation so drawn will enable us to make our ratification effective and to make it aooord with the spirit of the Washington Convention,Even if legislation were drafted on these lines there are certain special faotors to be taken into consideration.     The Railway Unions strongly cppase being brought within the Bill under any circumstances.
I suggest that they should be satisfied by the following arrangement.      They should not be excluded from the scope of the Bill, but they should be given to understand that the Minister will exercise the power to regulate by order the amount of overtime in such a way as to prevent any interference with the present agreements This assumes that the regular Sunday overtime can be -  regarded as a &quot;temporary exception&quot; within Article 6 (b). NSPOHT If, however, this provision is made with respectto the railwaymen there may be grave difficulties with regard to transport workers.     An illustration will make this clear.In the summer-time it is common for drivers of charabancs to drive parties of school-children down to the seaside. He starts early, in the morning,  he returns lat at night.    He is,  technically at any rate,  at work all the day;    though he may in fact, and probably is,  doing nothing except amuse himself.        If such a man  (this,  I am.   told, frequentljr happens) is so engaged during 6, er even 7 da.jQ a week,  it will appear that he is working a number of hours which shocks one 1s conscience.    At the same time,  stich a man might not favour legislation which would have the effect of preventing him doing this work if he so desires.11.
The question of the transport workers is particularly difficult inasmuch as they are not congregated in any specific  union .        The Railway Unions would &quot;be involved here also,  since by the powers recently granted to the Railway Companies many of their members are employed in transport work.      I would suggest that the whole matter both   as to the Railway and Road Transport conditions should be disoussed with the T.U.C. which oould,  in consultation with the appropriate unions, formulate the views of the workers on this point.My own conclusions as (to the drafting t*f the Bill are as follows:-Id        That commercial overtime must be allowed, and that the words &quot;exceptional oases of pressure of work&quot; must, therefore, be so expanded to make them bear in the courts of our country the sense which they already bear without expansion in the courts of other countries. 2.- Although, as a general principle, I think it desirableto work towards   - a definite limit and to discourage overtime, I should not myself feel disposed to take the responsibility of selecting the present time of no x:.ttle difficulty to impose upon industry a far-reaching change.    I do believe, however, the extent to which this commercial overtime may be worked should be limited to some definite period:    and in this connection I call attention to the fact that in a Bill introduced in the House of Commons on the 21st January, 1924, and backed by Mr. Ben Turner and Messrs Maokinder, Hudson and Tout,  this scheme was adopted, and the limit was placed at 8 hours per week.-1- fj o
3. I should myself prefer a monthly to a weekly limit as it permits of greater flexibility.. The agreement now in force governing the engineering trade serves as an excellent working model.    It provides for 30 hours overtime in any 4 weeks for commercial overtime and other ^yss^nr provisions in the case of emergency,  such as breakdown.It would probably be desirable,  in order to secure even greater elasticity, to give the Minister power by appropriate regulations to fix different limits in the event of agreements to that effect being concluded between representatives of workers and employers in any industry.      I suggest that we obtain the approval of the T.U.C. and the I.L.O. to this course so that in introducing the Bill we can state these facts.There are many minor difficulties   .aich would arise on this Bill; but once we have obtained the decision on the broad question as to whether commercial overtime is to be allowed we shall, I think, be able to surmount the other difficulties.25th January, 1930.
