This document is the property of His Britannic majesty&apos;s Government.277Printed for the Cabinet, February, 1930.SECRET.&apos; .-&apos; Corr No.CP. 35 (30)THE CABINET.REDUCTIONS AT THE ORDNANCE FACTORIES AND SIMILAR GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS.MEMORANDUM  BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR   WAR.1. The reductions which we are now, on grounds of high policy, seeking to make in      70 the expenditure on the Defence Services raise at once the question of reductions in the   General strength of the Ordnance Factories and I believe also in that of the Admiralty Dockyards.     7219 This  question is important  both  politically,   because  compulsory  discharges   from Government establishments are always unpopular, and, so far as the Factories are concerned, have for the last few years been entirely avoided; and departmentally, because the Factories are in danger of  being  reduced  below  their  minimum  or nucleus establishments, that is to say, below the strengths which are regarded as necessary if they are to expand effectively in emergency.   I presume that the Dockyards are, generally speaking, in the same case, and the purposes of this memorandum are : (1) To invite my colleagues in charge of the Service Departments to join with me in adopting a common policy in the matter of making compulsory discharges when necessary, and preventing all such discharges as, by any means, we can render unnecessary.(2) To invite all my colleagues, including those responsible for supplies to the Crown Colonies and India, to consider whether, in fulfilling their requirements for stores of any kind, they cannot place their orders either with the Dockyards or with the Ordnance Factories, and thereby, assist in keeping the staffs of these Service manufacturing establishments together.2. I am aware that consideration of these questions has already been initiated through the medium of the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee, but, whilst recognizing the value of the work already done and now proceeding, I think a further conference will facilitate a mutual understanding between those concerned, and I suggest accordingly that such a conference should be held without delay and should be attended by Ministers and their advisers, representing each Service Department concerned, and by representatives, ministerial or other, of the Civil Departments from whom I hope that additional kinds of work may be obtained.3. In the meantime I offer the following observations : (i) As to the former of the two questions raised above, so far as the OrdnanceFactories are concerned, it may be necessary to discharge gradually down to the nucleus establishments above mentioned, and at one factory Enfield  down to a new nucleus establishment to be fixed. I am exploring the possibility of short time and of the substitution of day work for piece woz-k, and if a suitable scheme is found it may be possible to avoid discharges. Otherwise, the number of discharges may be serious.(ii) As to the question of obtaining additional work for the Factories and Dockyardsfrom the Civil Departments my suggestions are as follows : (a) Without full consideration of all the implications it may not be desirable that any Government manufacturing establishment should undertake, in competition with the Trade, orders from private customers, or should manufacture for stock with a view to sale to private customers to be found later. When such a policy has been followed in the past, it appears to have had unfortunate results.(b30/17)   65   2/30   W.0.P,   i860
(-&amp;-) It is not desirable that the &quot;Service Departments, in supplying any goods to the Civil Departments, should do so at prices appreciably higher ,than those Civil Departments would have to pay to the Trade. I understand in this connection that means can probably be found for enabling the Factories and Dockyards to quote to the Civil Departments, for the new classes of work which we desire them to secure, firm prices which need not be loaded with the whole of the overhead expenses which on a strict cost.accounting basis might be chargeable on such orders. If Government factories undertake work to which they have not been accustomed, it must be assumed that a reasonable time must be accorded them to adapt themselves.(c) Provided that Service manufacturing establishments can quote firm prices in the above manner, it is desirable that they should do so on the footing of competing among themselves for any available orders, or settling among themselves by mutual agreement which orders any of-them will or will not execute. In other words, I do not propose that any one Service manufacturing establishment should be favoured at the expense of a,nother in obtaining new kinds of work from the Civil Departments.(d) There is however, I suggest, no objection to the Service manu-facturing establishments, as a whole, being informed of Trade quotations and invited to manufacture the goods required at the .same or .a lower price.,(e?) Subject to Treasury sanction, I /should have no objection,.so far as the Ordnance Factories are concerned, to the Service manufacturing estab-lishments being made liable, if necessary, to the usual commercial risks in cases r of default.4. The giving of executive effect to the :above matters will no doubt require consideration in some detail and I suggest that an Interdepartmental Committee ^should be set upon this subject under the .auspices of the Treasury. Such a Committee ^should, I think, include irepresentatives of the Treasury, Admiralty, War Office, and probably one or more of the non-service customer Departments.I hope that my colleagues may be able, to accept the above suggestions in principle, and in nominating their representatives to -attend the conference which I propose, may see their way to instruct them to proceed on the lines which I suggest and to endeavour to find for the Government establishments concerned as much new work as possible.T.
