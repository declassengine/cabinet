[This Document, is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for tlie Cabinet.   January 1930.CABINET.Political Situation in India and the Policy to be pursued in relation to the Situation created by the All-India National Congress Meeting at Liahore._____MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Cabinet at its meetings on the 15tli aud 16th January, I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of a telegram from the Government of India, summarising the political situation which results from the meeting of the All-India National Congress held at Lahore at the end of December, and outlining the policy which they recommend should be pursued to deal with the violent movements, revolutionary activities and campaign of civil disobedience which they apprehend may result ; also a copy of the reply which, after consulting the Lord Chancellor and the President of the Board of Education, and obtaining the approval of the Prime Minister, I - despatched to the Government of India on the 17th January. Accompanying this official telegram, a private telegram from myself to Lord Irwin and another conveying a personal.message to him from the Prime Minister were despatched on the same date.   Copies of these are also attached.W. B.18th January 1930.I.From Government of India, Rome Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 10th January 1930.&apos;72 S.   Recent meeting of Congress at Lahore had had striking effect upon the political situation.   We would invite attention to our telegram No. 255 S. of the 19th January 1929,* in which we summarised the position arising from the Calcutta Congress meeting, and gave our anticipations of the future course of events^ which have been very closely fulfilled.   The immediate reaction of Gandhi and Motilal Nehru to the Viceroy&apos;s announcement was mere favourable than might perhaps have been anticipated, and they were able to persuade Jawahar Lai Nehru, though much against his will, to sign Delhi declaration.   It soon became apparent, however, that the younger elements in the Congress, who were followers of Jawahar Lai and Subhas Bose, were not prepared to agree to the constitutional action contemplated by Motilal and Gandhi, aud it seemed clear that Congress would be the scene of a serious struggle between the two schools of thought, such as had been in part glossed over and postponed by decisions of the Calcutta Congress.   It was thought improbable that the younger party would  be prepared,  on   this occasion, to agree to any compromise.    On  the other hand, it was anticipated  that Gandhi  and Motilal would be most reluctant to capitulate to younger men, and that, if all efforts at a compromise failed, it was not impossible that there might be a split in the Congress. The fact that Gandhi and Motilal had been willing, at suggestion of a new party, to meet Viceroy just before opening of Congress Session strengthened impression that their influence would be cast on the side of moderation.   At the interview, however, it became plain that they had no real intention of participating in the Round-Table Conference, and it was no surprise when a few days later it was found that they had decided to throw in their lot with the younger and revolutionary party in Congress. As a result of this alliance, the main resolution passed by the Congress defined their objective as complete independence, and urged the Congressmen to devote their exclusive attention to attainment of this goal.As a preliminary step towards organising a campaign for independence, the Congress resolved upon the complete bombs^cott of the Central and Provincial Legislatures, and directed the Congress members of the Legislatures to resign their seats. Finally it authorised the All-India Congress Committee, whenever it deems fit, to launch upon a programme of civil disobedience, including the non-payment of taxes,* Not printed.4251      75   1.30SECRET.C.

whether in selected areas or otherwise, and.under such safeguards as it may consider necessary. Even this programme is not considered sufficiently advanced by Subhas Bose and his followers, who have setup a separate organisation, within the Congress with the ostensible object of pursuing a more thorough programme, though in point of fact secession is based almost entirely on personal hostility between Bose and the Nehrus.2. The Congress has thus declared itself to be a body which intends to pursue an illegitimate aim by unlawful and unconstitutional means. This decision is very unwelcome to the right wing, comprising for the most part the. older Congressmen. It is likely that a number of present Congress members of the Legislatures will decline to obey direction to resign their seats, and will thus come into direct conflict with Congress mandate. Whether formally or not, they will, in effect, cease to be members of Congress, and may tend to amalgamate with other Hindu Nationalist elements that already stand outside Congress, adding strength to these. The Liberals have already, in their meeting at Madras, taken a strong stand in favour of Round-Table Conference, and have not hesitated to condemn in the plainest way the goal of independence and immediate programme of Congress.Efforts are being made to organise more closely the Hindu Nationalists of all parties who believe in constitutional methods, and it seems probable that their consciousness of strong position they will hold at Round-Table Conference will suffice to keep them firm in their opposition to the Congress, particularly if the methods of the latter are seen to be failing and merely to be leading the country into disorder. On the other hand, the followers of the Congress doctrine will find themselves driven more and more rapidly to the extreme course. The ^driving force is provided by young men who are in fact revolutionaries, and they will not allow themselves to be restrained. It should be plainly recognised that the left wing, which is now in control of the Congress, must be regarded as irreconcilable, and that so long as the present attitude is maintained we must reckon with its determined hostility throughout the discussions about the new constitution and after its introduction. On the other hand, if the activities of the extremists are met resolutely, there seems every likelihood that their power and influence will steadity-diminish. .   .3. We are anxious to address Local Governments at the earliest possible moment, putting them in possession of our general estimtite of the situation and its probable developments, and indicating the methods which-should be followed in meeting it and making the following points : (a) Question of amnesty must be regarded as being completely in abeyance, for it was made plain, when we addressed Local Governments in December, that only conditions in which we could contemplate review of cases would: be creation of new situation consequent on cessation of campaign for independence, and abandonment of threats of civil disobedience. So far from this being the case, these movements are being intensified by ideas, which, in other circumstances, might have been considered tolerable but are in present circumstances out, of place.(b) Fenner Brockway&apos;s resolution and- discussion in Parliament have, we believe, left in minds of Local Governments some uncertainty as to whether our previous policy in regard to prosecution for, sedition has been modified. We had also suggested to them, while, there seemed to be some prospect of a change of heart on the side of extremists, that it was desirable to go slow with prosecutions that would otherwise have been instituted. We &quot;feel that it is necessary now to reaffirm, clearly the policy laid down in our letter D. 312* of 21st February 1929, addressed to the Local Governments, and in particular to make it plain, in view of criticism of Fenner-Brockway and &quot;others, that we do not feel justified in limiting discretion of Local Governments in initiating prosecutions to definite incitement to violence, but that they are free, as at present, to prosecute whenever&apos; in their judgment it is necessary to do so in order to check movements which are leading towards revolutionary action.(c) We anticipate that Congress will at first direct their activities to demonstrations and propaganda in favour of independence, combined with spreading of hatred of Government and racial hatred, and glorification of revolution and revolutionaiy criminals. Efforts will also be made to strengthen organisations of volunteers and youth movements. In the first place these activities should be dealt with, as they have been during the last year, by action under ordinary law. involving carefully selected prosecutions, but if these are not effective to keep situation -under control, it. &apos; &apos;- * Not printed. - .
-will be necessary to use the Seditious Meetings Act, and Part II of Grim in a I Liusr &apos; Amendment Act. (cl) When-Congress leaders judge that preliminary preparation: by. means of propaganda, &amp;c, has been sufficient, they Avill presumably initiate movement that will bring them.actively into conflict with law such as boycotts of foreign cloth or. liquor involving intimidation and picketing, or movements for non-payment of taxes. These should be met at once with firm executive action supplemented by use of Part II of Criminal Law Amendment Act, and if in our judgment taking of fresh powers is found necessary for dealing with such movements promptly and effectively, we should not hesitate to propose this, and are confident that we could rely on your support. For. instance, if a movement for non-payment of land revenue or other Government dues were started, it might be found that most effective way to deal with it would be to issue an Ordinance making it an offence to instigate people not to pay Government dues, (e) If, again, as is not improbable. Congress leaders endeavour in furtherance of their ends to promote strike of industrial workers, it might be necessary to take some special powers in order to deal with such a situation promptly.4. In general our policy is to avoid, for the present, any dramatic departure from existing methods. We desire to continue policy of conciliation of all who show themselves capable of being conciliated. &quot; The movement for independence may in some parts of the country at any rate fall quite flat. It is believed that Congress are not in possession of any large funds, and without these they must rely to a great extent on voluntary efforts of members of Youth League and similar organisations. Consequently, save - where these have effectively developed, it may be difficult to attempt anything on a large scale. Government action must be carefully adjusted to local conditions. We do not want restraining action of Government to exceed immediate requirements, and we shall impress on Local Governments disadvantages of passing small numbers, in early stage in agitation, of general prohibitory: orders which would give extremists what they are looking for, namely, an easy method . of-&apos; defying Government on a large scale. On the other hand, it must be clearly realised that, in a struggle of this nature, moral and psychological factors are of great importance. It is essential for Government to maintain a moral superiority over forces of disorder, and action, must not be delayed until that moral superiority has been lost.It is an elementary factor in the situation that, if Government is not prepared to-fight its own battles, it cannot expect that anyone else will be prepared to do so. The best way, therefore, to retain the support of the bulk of the population is to show&apos;;-: if; necessary by action, that Government has no intention of letting the extremists get&apos;&quot; the upper hand even temporarily. In this connection it is probable that a great deal can be done by judicious propaganda in districts to keep the mass of the population steady. But this must evidently be accompanied by convincing proof that Government are not only asserting their intention to enforce the law, but are actually enforcing it. It is not to be expected that the situation will develop uniformly in all provinces. Present indications suggest that most serious developments are likely to be in Bengal and the Punjab. The Punjab Government view the situation with considerable anxiety, and they will require to act firmly and promptly. The first line of defence must be the ordinary law ; the second, the exceptional powers which we already possess ; the third, the new powers which may have to be taken. The importance of the policy laid clown in our letter dated February .1929 is that it emphasises the need of the full utilisation of the first line of defence. Any neglect of the powers conferred by the ordinary law will merely hasten and make inevitable the time when more drastic powers have to be employed.5. In conclusion it is necessary to refer briefly to violence movement. This is not an ostensible part of the Congress programme. Nevertheless, the voting on the resolution about attempted outrage on the Viceroy shows that nearly half of the delegates.&quot; are at least in sympathy with those who follow methods of violence. The driving force of the Congress consists largely in those who are convinced believers in violence. Even Jawahar Lai, in his presidential speech, made it plain that his objection to violence was not on principle but merely because it promised no substantial results. The advocates of violence may well believe that that is an objection which can easily he overcome. Motilal Nehru, shortly before Congress met, visited Bhagat Singh in Magistrate^ Court at Lahore. In times when creed of non-violence had some vitality-it was found that a mass movement could not be conducted without violence. Now, when few active workers have any convinced belief in non-violence, it may be taken
as certain that danger of violence accompanying mass movements is greatly aggravated. This emphasises once more the necessity of dealing with these movements firmly at the beginning.6. Finally there are the terrorist organisations which definitely exist for perpetrating violent crimes. The whole atmosphere of the Congress has acted as a strong stimulus to these. Revolutionaries from all parts of India have been collected in the Congress camp and have been, it is believed, consulting and laying plans, ft is already known that Bengal revolutionaries are becoming very active, and within the last few weeks important arrests have been made, resulting in recovery of loaded bombs and inflammatory leaflets-see our telegram No. 3751 S.* of 31st December. The outrage on the Viceroy&apos;s train is another symptom. We have no desire to paint the picture in too high a colour, but prudence suggests that we must be prepared for a recrudesceuce of revolutionary crimes.7. We should be glad to have a very early reply as to whether you agree with the general lines of our policy as it is important to address the Local Governments at the-earliest possible moment.ii.From Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 31st December 1929.3751 S. On 19th December, police searched a room in No. 22/3, Machua Bazar Street, Calcutta, which was known to be a rendezvous for revolutionaries. This search, together with others which followed in Calcutta and other parts of Bengal, resulted in the seizure of a quantity of violently seditious and inflammatory literature and of bombs of a known and very efficient type. Some of the literature seized, which was in the form&apos; of leaflets advocating violence, was apparently just about to be disseminated, while the documents related to revolutionary organisation, and to acquisition of information regarding the strength of and arms available to staffs at the police stations and jails, and the nature of protection afforded to district officers, police officers and suspected police agents. The documents seized are indicative of the existence of plot to organise attack upon Government servants in one or more districts in Bengal. Seven arrests have been made.III.From Secretary of Stale to Government of India, Home Department, dated 17th January 1930.Your telegram dated 10th January, No. 72 S. I am obliged to you for the full and informative summary of situation and agree with your conclusions and with the policy which you propose to indicate to Local Governments. Home Department letter, No. D. 342, of 21st February 1929, lays down the right lines for the application of the ordinary law firmly against selected offenders of consequence.Firm executive action will, of course, evoke criticism in some quarters with which I am prepared to deal. But for this purpose and in order to keep my colleagues fully informed of developments I hope you will keep me as fully and promptly supplied as possible with information as to measures actually taken and their effects. I hope by means of these reports to learn in advance of any intention of your Government to use existing extraordinary powers ; though, if you think it necessary, you will act first and inform me after. In such event Your Excellency&apos;s Government may vts]y on my full support.In case events necessitate taking fresh powers I should expect to be consulted beforehand, and no doubt you contemplate this.I should like to suggest that you should, so far as possible, carry moderate opinion with you in enforcing the law. Now that Congressmen are absent from the Assembli7-this desirable course may be also possible;* DoCjiineiit ii.
4261BFrom Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 17th January 1930.Private and personal. Please refer to official telegram issuing in reply to Home Department telegram of 10th January, No. 72 S. Suggestion as to endeavouring to carry moderate opinion with you is that which I outlined in my private letters to you of 24th December and 2nd January.55If, as we both hope may not prove to be the case, you find it necessary to make use of extraordinary powers, I need not tell you that I have every confidence in your judgment and will support you fully.* The substance of the passages in question was to ask Lord Irwin whether it would he possible, by following the precedent established some nine years ago, when a Committee, consisting largely of Indian Members of the Legislature, was appointed to consider the necessity for the repressive measures on the Indian Statute book, to.get Indians to shai*e to some degree responsibility for such enactments.V.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 17th January 1930.Private and personal. My private and personal telegram of 17th January, No. 201. Prime Minister asks me to send you following personal message from himself: &quot; You might like to know that I associate myself with the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram and renew to you the promise of loyal support for your present policy. Try and avoid action which will force 37ou to deal with masses, but rather pick the responsible leaders and deal with them, whoever and whatever they are. Keep up moral authority of the Government and rally round it those who respect law and order, and whose political instincts will defend India from revolutionary movements, whilst pursuing evolutionary politics. Maintain policy of reform whilst handling with firm determination revolutionary leaders. Keep in close contact with us and go ahead with calm assurance.   I add my sympathies to my pledge of confidence.&apos;&apos;
