THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.P&apos;printed for the Cabinet.   February 1930.SECRET.Copy No.   38CP. 45 (30).CABINET.NEW TREATY WITH IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN conformity with the conclusions reached by the Cabinet at their meeting of the 9th September last, I have caused to be prepared, and now circulate for the consideration of my colleagues, a memorandum, with annexures, formulating detailed proposals for a new Treaty to regulate the relations between this country and Iraq when the latter enters the League of Nations. These proposals have been drawn up in consultation with the other interested. Departments. I concur generally in the recommendations now submitted and in the terms of the draft despatch of instructions, which it is proposed to address to the High Commissioner for Iraq.2. The accompanying documents have necessarily taken some considerable time to prepare. Many important and delicate questions were involved, demanding close and careful examination, and the present measure of agreement was only reached after prolonged interdepartmental discussion. As a result, some five months have elapsed since His Majesty&apos;s Government announced their intention o  concluding a new treaty with the Iraq Government. In the meantime, public opinion in Iraq has grown restive at the delay and not a little suspicious of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Iraq Government have frequently been questioned on the subject in the local Parliament, and have found it increasingly difficult to satisfy their supporters that the delay in opening negotiations does not imply any change of policy on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Furthermore, the High Commissioner for Iraq has recently represented that certain matters of urgency and importance, indirectly connected with the negotiation of the new Treaty, are pending, and that, in the absence of any indication of the treaty policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, no progress towards a settlement of these is possible.   He presses for early instructions.It seems clear that the good impression created by the announcement of September last is beginning to wear rather thin, and that if negotiations are delayed much longer they will be carried out in an unfavourable atmosphere, which may seriously prejudice the outcome. Consequently, it is important that the High Commissioner should, as soon as possible, be placed in a position to open negotiations with the Iraq Government. I trust, therefore, that the Cabinet will give this matter their urgent consideration in order that full instructions may be issued to the High Commissioner at the earliest possible date.P.February 10, 1930.[205761b
NEW TREATY WITH IRAQ.On the 9th September the Cabinet decided that the draft of a Treaty to be concluded with the Iraq Government prior to Iraq&apos;s admission to the League should be prepared in consultation between the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office, and that the draft Treaty should then be submitted to the Cabinet for examination in its political aspects. Subsequently the Cabinet decided that the Treasury and the Air Ministry should also be consulted in the preparation of the draft Treaty.2. The accompanying Memorandum of Proposals, with appendices (Annexure 2), has accordingly been drawn up as a result of discussions between the four Departments concerned. It was originally prepared, in accordance with instructions of the Cabinet, in the form of a draft Treaty; but the amended form, as now submitted, was subsequently adopted as the result of a suggestion made by the Air Ministry. It was thought desirable at the same time to frame a draft despatch of instructions to the Pligh Commissioner for Iraq; this draft despatch is also submitted (Annexure 1). Appended to the draft despatch will be found a draft memorandum (Annexure 3) setting out the assurances which it is suggested the Iraq Government should be prepared to give when applying for admission to the League of Nations.The draft despatch contains a fairly full explanation of the origin and purpose of the present proposals. There are, however, one or two questions of principle, not expressly dealt with in the draft despatch, which call for special mention.3. In the first place, it will be seen that provision has been made for the continued presence of British Forces in Iraq after Iraq enters the League of Nations.* On this point the Departments were without any clear guidance from the Cabinet; but as His Majesty&apos;s Government had announced that it was their intention that the proposed new Treaty with Iraq should be on the general lines of the recent proposals for an Anglo-Egyptian settlement (Cmd. 3376), and as those proposals contemplated the retention of a British garrison in Egypt, the Depart-nients have proceeded on the assumption that it was the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government that British Forces should similarly be retained under the new Treaty in Iraq. There are, moreover, the most cogent reasons of Defence Policy for the retention of British Air Forces in Iraq. In our Imperial Air Defence Policy as in the sphere of commercial aviation Iraq occupies a key position similar in practically every respect to that held by the Suez Canal in our maritime policy. The Air Ministry have represented that the severance of the vital link in the chain of air routes to the East, so far from diminishing the forces necessary for Imperial Defence overseas, would mean that the standard of air strength to be maintained both East and West of Iraq would have to be correspondingly increased, since the system of inter-reinforcement upon which the security of those regions is now based would become impossible. Iraq at present affords an ideal training station, contains permanent accommodation constructed at considerable cost to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and represents the only possible place oVarmes for the location of the central reserve upon which is based the strength and disposition of our Air Forces overseas.&apos; Apart from its strategical value, the air route through Iraq is the main trunk road over which must pass the commercial air traffic and mails to India, Australia and the Far East, and we must be in a position to safeguard that route.Moreover, the presence of a strong British air force in Iraq affords an important measure of security to the great industrial enterprises in the South Persian oilfields and in the Persian Gulf, and acts as a deterrent to the several possibilities of action hostile to the British Empire in Persia and Arabia generally, and as a check to any threat to India from Central Asia.4. Provision is made (proposal 2) for an exchange of Ministers (not Ambassadors) with Iraq. The disadvantages inherent in such an arrangement, together with the objections which would attach to the alternative of an exchange of Ambassadors, are briefly mentioned in the draft despatch to the High Commis-sioner. But it should be explained that it was with some reluctance that the Colonial Office finally deferred to the view of the Foreign Office that an exchange of Ambassadors could not be contemplated without the risk of great difficulties. The nature of such difficulties will be readily understood; it might, for example, have unfortunate effects were the Ambassadors of great Powers, such as the United States* The excess cost of the British garrison in Iraq and of the subsidy paid to the Iraq Army amounts at the present time to approximately  472,000 per annum.
of America or France, called upon to yield precedence to an Iraqi Ambassador because of his earlier arrival in London. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the proposal to exchange Ambassadors with Egypt has been published to the world. That being so, it is unlikely that the Iraq Government, who regard their country as no less advanced than Egypt, will be content to exchange Ministers only. Indeed, the vernacular press in Iraq is already demanding the appointment of a British Ambassador. The reasons which prompted the proposal that we should exchange Ambassadors with Egypt, viz., the necessity for ensuring the predominance of British influence and for guarding against undue foreign penetration or interference, apply equally to the case of Iraq. On the other hand, the population of Egypt is 14 millions, and that of Iraq 3 millions; as regards trade, Egypt&apos;s imports from the United Kingdom are 21 - 8 per cent, out of a total of 53 millions sterling, and her exports to the United Kingdom 38-3 per cent, out of a total of 57 millions sterling, whilst Iraq&apos;s imports from this country are 34-4 per cent, out of a total of 7-3 millions sterling, and her exports to this country 26 - 6 per cent, out of a total of 4-2 millions sterling. Sir Francis Humphrys, with whom this question was discussed before he left to take up his appointment in Iraq, strongly favoured the proposal that this country should be represented by an Ambassador at Baghdad, not by a Minister only. The former has, and the latter has not, the right to claim a personal interview with the Sovereign to whom he is accredited. Our High Commissioner at present enjoys a similar right in Iraq. If he is succeeded by an Ambassador this right will be preserved; if not, it will apparently be forfeited. It is understood, however, that the Foreign Office do not attach much importance to this formal right of audience, since His Majesty&apos;s Government would in any case insist on their Representative being treated with proper consideration in this respect.There is a further point to which even greater importance is attached. It is always possible that other countries, e.g., Turkey and Persia, may appoint Ambassadors at Baghdad. In that event, it would be impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to insist, as is contemplated in the case of Egypt, that the British repre-sentative should enjoy the permanent status of doyen of the local Diplomatic Body, and in the absence of some such arrangement&apos; he will eventually have to take second place to the representative of some other foreign Power.On the other hand, the considered view of the Foreign Office is that the appointment of an Iraqi Ambassador at the Court of St. James would, in practice, render it impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to refuse to receive Ambassadors from any other independent State in friendly relations with this country, with the ultimate result that the British Legations abroad would, in almost every case, have to be raised to the status of Embassies, and apart from the obvious diplomatic objections to such a development, the annual extra cost would be considerable. If this is so, an exchange of Ambassadors with Iraq must be regarded as impracticable. It might be possible to argue that, on the grounds of intimacy of relations and identity of interests, Iraq stands in a special position towards this country and is entitled to exceptional treatment; but this is not a line of argument that the Foreign Office think that it would be practicable to adopt towards other Powers.In any case, it is considered that the arguments for and against the proposal should be placed before the Cabinet.5. The memorandum of proposals, in its present form, contains no admission on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government that full responsibility for the maintenance of internal order in Iraq will, in the future, rest with the Iraq Government. The late Sir Gilbert Clayton, in his despatch of the 22nd July last (a copy of which accompanied the memorandum circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 3rd September, 1929 (CP. 239 (29)), explained that this question of responsibility was one of the main points at issue with the Iraq Government; and it is clear from the attitude which they adopted when the amendment of the Military Agreement of 1924 was under consideration that the Iraq Government attach a quite disproportionate importance to obtaining a formal admission from His Majesty&apos;s Government that the era, of divided responsibility has definitely ended. Such an admission might seem unnecessary, having regard to the fact that the proposed new Treaty will be concluded with a State which, ostensibly at least, will by then have attained to complete and sovereign independence; but the Iraq Government obviously attach such great importance to this question that it is possible that they may ask that an acknowledgment in terms of their responsibility should be included in the proposed new Treaty.   In that[205761 * b 2
event, it would be difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to oppose the Iraq Governments request. The Air Ministry, however, are opposed to the insertion of any such provision if it can possibly be avoided. They hold the view that it might, in future, prove a source of embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and would, moreover, imply that the Government of Iraq are, in fact, capable of guaranteeing the internal security of the country without assistance from British forces, an implication which, in the decided view of the Air Staff, has no warrant in fact. In their opinion, circumstances may well render it essential for British forces in Iraq to intervene to quell civil disturbances, not only for their own immediate security, but in order to prevent the machinery of Government being entirely dislocated, with consequent danger to the security of the essential air communications and other British interests in the country. They are, therefore, most averse from the inclusion in the proposed Treaty of any article which would definitely preclude the intervention of British forces except at the express request of the Iraq Government, since they feel that the effect of the inclusion of such an Article would be to prevent the inter-vention o&apos;f British forces in the incipient stages of trouble, with the result that the situation would be likely to get completely out of control and beyond hope of suppression without the help of considerable reinforcements.The other Departments feel, however, that if Iraq is to be set up as an independent State, responsibility for the preservation of order throughout the country must, at least theoretically, rest with the Iraq Government, and that any intervention by British Forces (other than in self-defence) in the internal affairs of Iraq, except at the express request of the Iraq Government, would be incompatible with her position as an independent State.Moreover, the inclusion in the Treaty of a formal acknowledgment of the Iraq Government&apos;s responsibility for maintaining internal security would serve other uses than that of satisfying Iraqi amour-propre. It would, to some extent, disarm the critics in this country, who are always clamouring for the liquidation of British -commitments in the Middle East and it might, in some measure, serve to dispel the suspicion prevalent at Geneva that Iraq cannot yet stand on her own feet and that, whatever may be their public professions, His Majesty&apos;s Government really intend to maintain a veiled protectorate over the country.In all the circumstances, it is thought best to furnish Sir F. Humphrys with a full explanation of the apprehensions felt by the Air Staff and to inform him that His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer that the proposed new Treaty should not contain an express admission of the Iraq Governments responsibility, Avhile at the same time giving him discretion to insert such an admission in the treaty should the Iraq Government press for it and should he consider it unwise or impracticable to oppose their wishes.6. There is another point which should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet. In paragraph 13 of the Departmental Memorandum circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 3rd September (CP. 239 (29)) it was suggested that the Iraq Government might object to the presence of a foreign garrison so close to the capital of Iraq as the Hinaidi Aerodrome. It was further suggested that, if the a withdrawal of the British Forces to a greater distance from Baghdad were regarded as practicable, it might be better tactics to make a spontaneous offer of such withdrawal to the Iraq Government. Since that suggestion was made the Air Staff have explained that they attach the greatest possible importance to the retention of the Hinaidi Aerodrome, without which they are convinced that it would be impossible on military grounds to secure the purposes for which the British garrison is provided. They even consider it doubtful whether a British garrison could be safely retained in Iraq at all if that aerodrome had to be relinquished. In deference to these views, Hinaidi has been mentioned in Clause A of the military proposals (first appendix to Annexure 2) as one of the stations where His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to retain forces in Iraq. It is, however, necessary to point out that, if the Iraq Government pressed for the evacuation of Hinaidi, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to be prepared to meet the charge of inconsistency based on the contrast which would be drawn between their policy in. Egypt and their policy in Iraq in regard to the retention of troops near to the respective capitals of the two countries. But up to the present time there has been no evidence to indicate that the Iraq Government propose to press for the removal of British forces from the Aerodrome at Hinaidi.Middle East Department,Colonial Office, February, 1930.
ANNEXTJRE I.Draft Despatch to the High Commissioner for Iraq.Sir,ON the 14th September, with the full authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government conveyed in my telegram No. 264 of the 11th September, the Iraq Government were informed, without proviso or qualification, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to support the candidature of Iraq for admission to the League of Nations in 1932, and that at the next Session His Majesty&apos;s Government would inform the Council of the League of Nations that they had decided not to proceed with the unratified Treaty of 1927, but that they proposed, in accordance with Article 3 (1) of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1926, to recommend Iraq for admission to the League of Nations in 1932.The Iraq Government were also informed on the same occasion that, as it would be necessary to conclude a Treaty before 1932 in order to regulate the relations between the United Kingdom and Iraq after the latter&apos;s: admission to the League, the necessary steps would be taken to prepare a Draft Treaty for that purpose, which would be based generally upon the recent proposals for an Anglo-Egyptian settlement.2. This despatch is not primarily concerned with the first part of that message. As you were informed in my telegram No. 351 of the 8th of November, formal notification has already been made to the League Council of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention to recommend Iraq for admission to the League of Nations in 1932, and the time is not yet ripe to translate into performance the first part of the undertaking given to the Iraq Government. It is sufficient to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to add nothing to, and to withdraw nothing from, that undertaking. It was intentionally framed in unambiguous terms, and it needs no gloss.3. It is rather with the second part of the communication to the Iraq Government, namely, the proposed new Treaty to govern the relations between this country and Iraq after Iraq enters the League, that the present despatch will deal. Before referring to the main objects which His Majesty&apos;s Government hope to secure in the new Treaty, it would be well to point to one essential difference between the new Treaty and those which have preceded it. Hitherto, our Treaties with Iraq have had a double purpose. They have been intended both to preserve essential Imperial interests in Iraq and to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government effectively to discharge the international obligations which they have assumed in respect of Iraq. The latter object has hitherto been predominant in the instruments regulating the relations between the two countries. It will find no place in the new Treaty. Whatever engagements Iraq may be called upon to assume on becoming- a member of the League of Nations, those engagements must in future be assumed towards the League. His Majesty&apos;s Government can assume no responsibility whatever for the discharge of Iraq&apos;s international obligations after her entry into the League. Consequently, in framing the settlement between this country and Iraq, His -Majesty&apos;s&apos;s Government propose to confine themselves to safeguarding Imperial interests and to avoid all direct or indirect responsibility for the protection of foreign interests (other than British) in Iraq.4. The main objects to be secured in the new Treaty, and the general principles I which should govern the future relationship between the two countries, have already I been suggested in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the late Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s despatch, I Secret B., of the 22nd July. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in full accord with the I views there expressed, and they have now given careful consideration to the best I means of attaining those objects and of translating those principles into Treaty I provisions. As a result, the Memorandum of Proposals, with appendices, I accompanying this despatch has been prepared as a basis for negotiation. You will 1 observe that these documents are to a large extent based upon the print containing I the recent proposals for an. Anglo-Egyptian settlement (Cmd. 3376), copies of which I have already been communicated to you. Where possible, the actual terminology I employed iii the notes exchanged with the Egyptian Prime Minister has mutatis I mutandis been employed.
5. The reasons underlying the provisions of the accompanying proposals may not in every case be readily apparent, and it is hoped that the following commentary may serve to make the origin and purpose of each article clear.Principal Memorandum.Proposal 1 calls for no special comment. As you will see, it follows closely the wording of paragraph 2 of the Egyptian proposals. The first sentence, which does not appear in the Egyptian model,&quot; is taken from Article 2 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1927.Proposal 2.Provision is made for the establishment of diplomatic relations by the exchange of Ministers; not, as in the Egyptian proposals, by the exchange of representatives of the rank of Ambassador. His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate that the arrange-ment contemplated is open to important disadvantages. A British Minister may find himself required to take second place to the representative in Iraq of some foreign Power holding the rank of Ambassador, or to some foreign Minister whose appointment is of anterior date to his own. A British Minister would not, moreover, as would an Ambassador, have the absolute right in virtue of his appointment to claim audience of the King of Iraq. Furthermore, it is possible that the Iraq Government may resent the fact that, whereas an exchange of Ambassadors is contemplated in the case of Egypt, an exchange of Ministers only is proposed in the case of Iraq.Nevertheless, while fully realising the objections to the proposed proposal, His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable at present to contemplate the appointment of an Iraqi Ambassador in London. Such an appointment would seriously complicate the diplomatic situation at the Court of St. James&apos;s, and would place His Majesty&apos;s Government in a most embarrassing position vis-a-vis those Powers in whose capitals His Majesty&apos;s Government have not hitherto established Embassies. I am advised that if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to accept an Ambassador from King Faisal it would in practice be impossible to deny the privilege of establishing an Embassy in London to any other independent Power.An alternative proposal, which would not be open to any of the foregoing objections, has been advanced. It has been suggested that, on the analogy of the arrangement between France and Switzerland, His Majesty&apos;s Government should be represented in Baghdad by an Ambassador and the Iraq Government in London by a Minister. If this arrangement were adopted, it would still be necessary, in order to safeguard the position of the British Ambassador as permanent doyen of the diplomatic body at Baghdad, to call upon the Iraq Government to undertake not to receive any other diplomatic representative of a higher rank than that of Minister. I imagine that such an arrangement would be regarded as derogatory, and would be unacceptable to public opinion in Iraq, but, if you consider that there is any prospect of its acceptance, you are authorised to put the proposal before the Iraq Government.Proposals 3 and 4.These proposals closely follow the Egyptian model and call for no comment. Proposal 5.This proposal is in almost identical terms with paragraph 7 of the Egyptian proposals.It is clear from the attitude which the Iraq Government adopted when the amendment of the Military Agreement of 1924 was under consideration, and also from paragraph 17 of Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s despatch of the 22nd of July last, that the Iraq Government have hitherto attached a quite disproportionate importance to the question of the responsibility for the maintenance of internal security in Iraq and the defence of Iraq from external aggression. His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore given careful consideration to the question of including in the Treaty which is to govern the future relations between this country and Iraq a definite admission on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government that full responsibility for the maintenance
of internal order in Iraq will in future rest with theTTraq Government, and that the era of divided responsibility has definitely ended. Such an admission might seem unnecessary, having regard to the fact&apos; that the proposed new Treaty will be concluded with a State which, on the entry into force of the Treaty, will have attained, ostensibly at least, to complete and sovereign independence. But, as the Iraq Government obviously attach great importance to the question, it is possible that they may ask that an acknowledgment in terms of their responsibility in the matter may be included in the proposed new Treaty. In that event it might be difficult to refuse their request.On the other hand, such an admission might prove a source of embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the future, and would, moreover, imply that the Iraq Government are, in fact, capable of guaranteeing the internal security of the country without the assistance of British forces. I am advised that this implication is not one that can be accepted, and that the forces at present at the disposal of the Iraq Government are not adequate for the purpose in view. It is possible, therefore, that circumstances might arise which would render it essential for British forces in Iraq (the question of the presence of British forces in Iraq is dealt with in connection with Proposal 7 below) to intervene to quell civil disturbances, not only for their own immediate security, but in order to prevent the machinery of Government being entirely dislocated, with consequent danger to the security of essential air com-munications and to other British interests in Iraq. From this point of view, therefore, it is preferable that the proposed new Treaty should contain nothing which would definitely preclude the intervention of British forces except at the express request of the Iraq Government, since the effect of such a provision might be to prevent the intervention of British forces in the incipient stages of disorder, with the result that the situation might pass completely out of control and beyond hope of suppression without the help of considerable reinforcements.It might be held, on the other hand, that if Iraq is to be set up as an independent State, at least nominal responsibility for the preservation of order throughout the country must rest with the Iraq Government, and that any intervention by British Forces (other than in self-defence) in the internal affairs of Iraq, except at the express request of the Iraq Government, would be. incompatible with her status as an independent State.I have thought it well to invite your attention to the various considerations affecting the question which His Majesty&apos;s Government have had in mind in-reaching a decision. They have decided that, in all the circumstances, it is preferable that the proposed new Treaty should not contain an express admission of the Iraq Government&apos;s responsibility in the matter. At the same time, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to leave you discretion to agree to the insertion of such a provision in the Treaty if the Iraq Government press for it and you consider that no other course is practicable.If such a provision should prove to be necessary, His Majesty&apos;s Government would suggest that it should appear as an additional paragraph of Proposal 5, and that it should be worded on the following lines :-&quot; Nevertheless, it is understood between the High Contracting Parties that full responsibility for the maintenance of internal order in Iraq and, subject to the provisions of the present clause, for the defence of Iraq from external aggression, rests with His Majesty the King of Iraq.&quot;Proposal 6.This proposal is based upon paragraph 8 of the Egyptian proposals and sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) of the British Note on the subject of the Army.proposal 7.As you will see, this proposal, which is based upon paragraph 9 of the Egyptian proposals, provides for the retention in Iraq of a British Garrison after Iraq enters he League. It is to be hoped that the Iraq Government, as much in their own nterests as those of His Majesty&apos;s Government, will be prepared to accept at least he principle of this provision, and the conversation between King Faisal and lajor Young, reported in. the latter&apos;s Secret despatch of the 14th October last, would ertainly seem to justify some&apos; degree of confidence on this score.&apos; If, however, this ope proves to be unfounded and the Iraq Government definitely decline to con-
template the idea of British Forces remaining in Iraq after 1932, then a serious situation will arise, and you should report to His Majesty&apos;s Government for further instructions.There is one further point in connection with this proposal which demands mention. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in full agreement with the view expressed an paragraph 6 of Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s despatch of the 22nd July, that any ground troops necessary for the protection of the Royal Air Force units remaining in Iraq, should not be provided by the Iraq Army but should be entirely under British control. For this purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to retain under the same degree of British control as exists at present, the two remaining Battalions of Levies. If the Iraq Government are prepared to agree to this, the proposed Treaty settlement will presumably have to contain provision to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to continue to recruit Iraqi subjects for service with the Levies. The Iraq Government have on occasion shown themselves dissatisfied with the present arrangement whereby persons of Iraqi nationality are serving in what are tantamount to British Units, and they may well oppose the retention of these Levy Battalions by His Majesty&apos;s Government. If this proves to be the case, and the political obstacles to the continuance of the present arrangement are found to be insuperable, then it may be necessary to introduce into Iraq an equivalent number of Indian troops to replace the Levy Battalions. His Majesty&apos;s Government would, however, be most reluctant to do this on account of the expense* and inconvenience involved, and you should do your utmost to induce the Iraq Government to allow the existing Levy Battalions to be retained on British charge. If your efforts are unsuccessful, before acquiescing in any other arrangement you should report the situation to His Majesty&apos;s Government and await instructions.Proposal 8.This is based on paragraph 10 of the Egyptian proposals. The second sentence, which is suggested by the Egyptian Note on Advisers, is intended to secure to His Majesty&apos;s Government some control over the selection of British officials appointed to serve under the Iraq Government. This is considered essential. As the number of British officials in Iraq decreases and the Iraq Government become more independent of external advice, the choice of officials to fill the few remaining posts in the Iraq Government Service open to foreigners will acquire even a greater importance than is now the case.In view of the impatience of foreign control lately shown by the Iraq Govem-ment (as reflected in the confidential programme of the present Cabinet) and of the recent Press campaign in favour of a sweeping reduction of British officials, it was felt that it would be fruitless to attempt to secure an undertaking from the Iraq Government to employ any given number of British officials. The present agitation probably derives much of its support from the fact that the Iraq Govern-ment are at present compelled by Treaty to employ British officials. Once the element of compulsion is removed and the Iraq Government find that they are free to employ as many or as few British officials as they like, it is to be hoped that the present artificial agitation will subside, wiser counsels will prevail and the Iraq Government will of their own free will turn once again to this country for military and civil advisers in adequate numbers.In the intervening period your influence with the Iraq Government should be used to restrain within reasonable limits any tendency towards a wholesale dismissal of British officials.Proposal 9.You will observe that although mention is made of a second appendix dealing with financial matters, no such appendix actually accompanies this despatch. Of the important questions still at issue with the Iraq Government two only relate to finance, namely, the disposal of the Iraq Railways and of the Port of Basra. It is to be hoped that both of these questions will be satisfactorily settled before the proposed new treaty enters into force. If this hope is realised no special financial provisions will be required and proposal 9 can be omitted; if not, it will be necessary to negotiate some instrument to provide a means of fixture settlement. But at the present stage it would clearly be useless to attempt to forecast what such instrument should contain.* It is estimated that the additional expenditure involved would amount to some  30,000 per annum.
Proposals 10, 11 and 12.These call for no special comment.Proposal 13.This provides that the proposed Treaty shall not enter into force until Iraq has become a member of the League of Nations. It is possible that this provision will be unwelcome to the Iraq Government, who apparently contemplate an earlier date for the entry into force of the new Treaty and for the complete emancipation of Iraq. But it is, I think, obvious that, until His Majesty&apos;s Government are formally relieved of their responsibilities towards the League of Nations by the admission of Iraq to membership of that body, they must retain the necessary Treaty powers to enable them to discharge those responsibilities. The new treaty now contemplated clearly would not provide them with adequate powers for that purpose, and any treaty which could be concluded and brought into force now would, like the abortive Treaty of 1927, necessarily be of a quasi-mandatory character, and thus unacceptable to public opinion in Iraq.As in the Egyptian model, revision of the terms of the treaty by agreement at the end of 25 years is contemplated.Proposal 14 is purely formal and requires no explanation.6. Before passing to the first appendix (military proposals) there is one apparent omission from the principal memorandum to which I would call attention. It contains no provision on the subject of commercial relations between this country and Iraq. This omission is intentional. It was considered that the most convenient method of regulating questions of commerce between the two countries, and one least likely to excite in foreign circles suspicion that His Majesty&apos;s Government were seeking to secure a privileged position for British trade in Iraq, would be to conclude with the Iraq Government a separate agreement on the lines of the commercial treaties existing between this country and the majority of other foreign States. This would, inter alia, provide for the reciprocal grant of most-favoured-nation treatment. A copy of the Model Treaty is enclosed for your information and guidance. *First Appendix: Clause A.7. You will see that His Majesty s Government wish to retain British forces (actually, in each case, Air Force units with protective ground troops) at or in the vicinity of Mosul, Hinaidi and Basra. (The object of the words &quot; in the vicinity of,&quot; and of the mention of Basra rather than Shuaiba, is to provide for the retention in their present locations of the land aerodrome at Shuaiba and the seaplane station at Basra.) The Air Staff attach the greatest importance to the retention of Air Force units at each of these three stations, and you should, therefore, use your utmost endeavours to persuade the Iraq Government to accept such an arrangement. The third paragraph of this clause is intended to secure, without undue emphasis, the retention by the British Forces remaining in Iraq of the judicial and fiscal privileges which they at present enjoy under Articles 10 and 11 of the Military Agreement of 1924 and under Articles 14 and 15 of the Financial Agreement. I understand that the Air Ministry have not yet had time to examine fully whether this paragraph adequately covers the requirements of the garrison, and I will communicate with you further on the subject as soon as possible.Clause B.The first paragraph is based upon Article 13 of the Military Agreement of 1924. The words &apos;&apos; of all arms &apos;&apos; have been inserted in order to ensure without possibility of doubt that the provision applies to His Majesty&apos;s Naval as well as Military Forces. In this connection I would invite reference to Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s Confidential despatch of the 2nd September on the subject of facilities for the free movement of His Majesty&apos;s ships in the ports and waterways of Iraq.* Not printed.[20576] c
Clause C.This closely follows Article 2 of the Military Agreement of 1924. Clause D.This is based upon the Egyptian proposals (paragraph (2) of the British Note on the subject of the Army). The question of the strength and composition of the British Military Mission mentioned in this clause is clearly a matter for discussion with the Iraq Government. Although His Majesty&apos;s Government have no desire to interfere unduly with the Iraq Governments discretion in the matter of the corn-position of this mission, they wish you to direct your efforts to securing the acceptance by the Iraq Government of a British Military Mission of a strength sufficient to exert a real and enduring influence within the Iraq Army.8. In paragraph 3 of this despatch it is pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose in their settlement with Iraq to enter into any vicarious engagements to protect the interests of other foreign Powers or their nationals. This does not mean, however, that the League of Nations will be content to admit Iraq to membership without ensuring that the interests of other States members of the League are adequately safeguarded. On certain points undertakings will undoubtedly be demanded, and will have to be given before Iraq is admitted to membership; but these undertakings will not, as hitherto, be entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government on behalf of Iraq; they will be obligations which Iraq will have to assume on her own behalf, and at first hand. Much consideration has been given to the question of what assurances, apart from those expressly mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 1 of the Covenant, Iraq may reasonably be expected to give, and in the light of past applications for admission to the League and of the -advice which His MajestyS Government have received as to League practice, a memorandum, a copy of which is enclosed for your information and guidance, has been prepared setting out such assurances, as, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Iraq Government would be well advised to give, if invited to do so. A copy of this memorandum should be communicated to the Iraq Government with the necessary explanations at some suitable stage of the negotiations.9. I am advised that when applications for admission to membership of the League are received they are referred to a Committee of the Assembly. This Committee then proceeds to examine the question whether the applicant State satisfies the conditions prescribed in paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the Covenant, and to invite the representative of that State to furnish further information or give specific assurances upon such points as the Committee deems necessary. When its investigations are completed the Committee reports to the Assembly of the League, who then put the question to the vote. I understand that if the Committee&apos;s report is favourable, there is little or no likelihood of the application being rejected by the Assembly. It is thus of the utmost importance that the Iraq Government, when applying for admission to the League, should be in a position to furnish the Committee with such information and such assurances as will ensure that the Committee&apos;s report is favourable. It is not suggested that the assurances set out in the accompanying memorandum should necessarily be volunteered by the Iraq Government; merely that their representative at Geneva should be armed with authority to give such assurances should the. necessity arise. It should also be noted that the list of assurances in the memorandum is not necessarily exhaustive, and that Iraq might be asked to add others.10.   I will now examine the assurances paragraph by paragraph : Paragraph 1 calls for little comment. It follows closely the wording of the assurance given by the Abyssinian Government when making application for admission.Paragraph 2.With regard to the first part of this assurance, I should explain that His Majesty&apos;s Government have given consideration to the question whether the Iraq Government could reasonably be expected to undertake in advance to accede to all or any of the international conventions and agreements referred to in Articles 6 and 7 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1927.   A certain number of those conventions have
already been acceded to either by or on behalf of Iraq, and in the case of tne remaining conventions there seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government little justification for requiring Iraq to forgo the discretionary right, which she should enjoy in common with other free nations of deciding in which of the various International Agreements, &amp;c, negotiated under the auspices of the League she should participate.The Arms Traffic Convention, however, stands in a somewhat different category. Article 1 of the Covenant contemplates the imposition of regulations in regard to the armaments of a State applying for membership. In the case of Abyssinia an assurance somewhat similar to that now suggested in the case of Iraq was demanded and obtained. Iraq, like Abyssinia, is a territory originally situated within one of the &quot;special zones&quot; prescribed by the Arms Traffic Convention, and it seems almost inevitable that the Iraq Government will have to enter into an engagement to accede to this Convention so soon as it becomes operative, and, at the same time, to assume the undertakings contemplated in Article 28 of the Convention. As you are aware, the Iraq Government in 1925 agreed to adhere to this Convention on its entry into force, and it is therefore unlikely that they will take exception to the assurance now proposed.The second part of this assurance also needs explanation. It was thought probable that the League might seek to continue in some form the non-discriminatory provisions of Article 11 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, and might attempt to obtain from the Iraq Government an assurance in terms similar to those employed in that Article. The effect of this would be to limit to some extent the freedom of action of the Iraq Government in negotiating future commercial agreements and in developing the natural resources of the country. It has been suggested to His Majesty&apos;s Government that, if the Iraq Government were to undertake to accede to the Convention relating to the treatment of foreigners which has recently been under discussion at Paris, members of the League would find it very difficult to justify a demand for any further assurances. If that Convention, when it is concluded, is generally accepted as providing adequate protection for foreign nationals in all other States of the League, it clearly would be both unreasonable and derogatory to regard it as inadequate in the case of Iraq. A preliminary draft of the Convention is enclosed for your information and that of the Iraq Government.Paragraph 3.Something on the lines of this assurance will almost certainly be required from Iraq and, as the Iraq Government presumably have no intention of repudiating international engagements regularly assumed, they are unlikely to take exception to this paragraph.Paragraph 4.Various organs of the League of Nations have shown themselves extremely solicitous of the welfare of racial and religious minorities in the Near and Middle East,, and in their report to the Council on the Iraq Report for 1928 the Permanent Mandates Commission suggested that, as a condition precedent to the admission of Iraq to the League, adequate safeguards on the subject of minorities should be obtained. The Iraq Government will almost certainly be required to give an assurance in terms similar to that suggested in the memorandum.Paragraph 5.The new judicial system which it is proposed to introduce in Iraq on the abolition of the Judicial Agreement of 1924 is unlikely to enter into force until shortly before the date proposed for the admission of Iraq. There will thus not be a sufficient interval to enable foreign States to satisfy themselves that the new system, has been established on a satisfactory and enduring basis. It seems certain that the League will require&apos; an assurance from Iraq that the system will be retained in force for a sufficient period (say, 10 or 15 years) to ensure that the administration of justice in Iraq is likely to be maintained at a satisfactory level of efficiency.11. It is not the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government unduly to limit your discretion in the matter of the wording of the proposed new treaty and subsidiary instruments. The accompanying; proposals are intended in the main to be for your information and guidance.   It is quite possible that in the give and take of[20576]     ... &apos;   &apos; c 2 &apos;&quot;
negotiation you will find alternative wording which would be more acceptable to the Iraq Government and would equally well safeguard the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It has often been found in the past that a comparatively unimportant alteration of wording or a slight rearrangement of ideas has been sufficient to overcome strongly pressed objections on the part of the Iraq Government. It is not improbable that similar circumstances will arise in your forthcoming negotiations capable of being handled in the same fashion. The new Treaty will, however, come under close and most critical scrutiny at Geneva and elsewhere; consequently, the wording calls for a greater degree of caution and assumes a greater importance than would normally be the case. It would be well, therefore, that before definitely accepting any important departure from the terms of the accompanying proposals you should report to London for the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government.12. His Majesty&apos;s Government are quite content to leave the question of the best method of negotiating the proposed new Treaty to your unfettered discretion. They are, however, much impressed by the view taken in Major Young&apos;s Secret despatch of the 14th of October as to the desirability of arranging that the Iraq Government should themselves take the initiative in making proposals. There are obvious advantages in this method. It is possible that by this means the Iraq Government might, as Major Young-apparently contemplates, be induced to offer spontaneously concessions which, if first asked for by His Majesty&apos;s Government, might only be drawn from them with great difficulty and in return for compensating advantages. It would, moreover, go some way to meet the criticism, frequently ventilated in the local Parliament and in the vernacular press, that hitherto the part played by the Iraq Government in the negotiation of treaties with this country has been negligible, and that the treaties have in practice been imposed ready-made on Iraq by His Majesty&apos;s Government.13. His Majesty&apos;s Government doubt, however, the advisability of proceeding in quite so formal a manner as is suggested in the last paragraph of Major Young&apos;s despatch. They are apprehensive lest a formal request to the Iraq Government to state their desiderata might draw forth a document the effect of which would be to commit that Government too definitely to certain proposals at an early stage of the negotiations, a document, moreover, which might subsequently acquire something of the character of a &quot; National Pact.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are inclined to think that it might be wiser to proceed in the first instance more informally, and to draw from the Iraqi representatives in the course of preliminary conversations some rough indication of the provisions which they would wish to see included in the new treaty, and, while not disclosing the British proposals in the early stages, to bring those proposals forward piecemeal in the course of negotiation. While I have thought it well to mention this doubt and this suggestion, I wish to emphasise that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no wish whatever&quot;to interfere with your discretion at any stage in regard to the conduct of the negotiations. You &quot;alone are in a position to judge both the opportunity and the method of approach, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have the fullest confidence in your judgment.ANNEXURE 2,Memorandum of Proposals for an Anglo-Iraq Settlement.Proposal 1.There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of Iraq.There shall be established between the High Contracting Parties a close alliance in consecration of their friendship, their cordial understanding and their good relations.Proposal 2.Each High Contracting Party will be represented at the Court of the other High Contracting Party by an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, duly accredited.
