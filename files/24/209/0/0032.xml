hi \J i)(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HI:s Britannic  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVS^MBNT)SjjR E T . n.P. 35  (30)-COPY NO./j.!&amp;CABINET,UNEMPLOYMSNT POLICY.Copy of letter from Mr. Thomas Johnston to the Prime ivilnlster.SCOTTISH OFFICE,Mhitehall, s.TI.1.Dear Prime Minister, 24th January,  1930.Tho Chancellor of the Duchy has been good enough to let me have a copy of the memorandum on Unemployment which he has forwarded you and. the Lord Privy Seal.I think it is my duty to say that I fully endorse the Chancellor of the Duchy&apos;s critical examination of the present method of dealing with relief work schemes.The honorary advisory committee of Ministers -as the Chancellor of the Duchy describes the three&apos; of us  -Lansbury,  Mosley and myself have only been summoned to a meeting,   I think,  on two occasions during the past six months. The belief that such a Committee sits regularly with either deliberative or executive powers is liable to give rise to misunderstanding among the members of the Government, the Party,  and. the Public, and it Is likely to place the  three Ministers in undeserved difficulties in the future,  as they may be held partly responsible for decisions which are not theirs and. about which they were in fact never consulted.In my judgment,  therefore,  the advisory Committee should be formally, as It is in fact,  dissolved,  and some new and
more effective -machinery for dealing with unemployment relief schemes substituted.Personally,  I could never see any reason why we should not have an all Party Committee of the House of Commons sitting regularly examining specific relief projects. &quot;&quot;hether a road, or bridge should be built here,  or a canal cut there,  would seem to me  to be as fltt mi subjects for an all party House of Commons consideration as are Public Accounts or the Bills submitted to the Provisional Orders Committees.      The execution of public works are of course for the responsible ministers or local authorities,   and the fixation of the limit of expenditure is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer,   the Cabinet and: the House of Commons to determine.      But the old. administrative objection that an all party Committee sitting in. continuous session considering specific schemes, hearing evidence and making recommendations, would in any warn hamper or embarrass the responsible Ministers, would seem to have loss validity than ever after our experience of the working of Unemployment Grants Committee.From a hurried examination of Sir Oswald :/ToVsleyrs proposals it would, not seem difficult to Incorporate an all party standing Committee on Relief Schemes.And in any case the great political advantage  to a Minority Government of engaging representatives of  the opposition parties in. the day to day consideration of such schemes is so obvious that I need not stress it.Yours very sincerely,(Signed^ TUO.V.S JOHNSTON.
