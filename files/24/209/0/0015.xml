Copy No.    104338-C.(Also Paper No. CCS. 207.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.NAVAL STATIONS IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND WEST INDIES.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.Introduction.1.   AT their meeting on the 6th November, 1929, the Cabinet agreed &quot; That the questions raised in the course of the Prime Ministers conver-sations with President Hoover, relating to naval stations in the North Atlantic and West Indies, should be considered in the first instance by the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, on the basis of an extract from the Prime Minister&apos;s Report of his conversations to be circulated shortly, and of a highly confidential declaration made by the American Navy Department.&apos;&apos;The extract from the Prime Minister&apos;s report, referred to above, is attached as Enclosure No. 1, and part of a report by the Prime Minister on conversations with Mr. Mackenzie King with regard to &quot; Naval Stations in the Western Hemisphere &quot; is reproduced as Enclosure No. 2.2. It will be recalled that the genesis of this question was a statement made by President Hoover in the course of his conversations with the Prime Minister to the effect that, although no responsible authority in the United States regarded the British Naval Stations at Bermuda and Jamaica as a real menace to the United States, there was a good deal of misapprehension on the subject in the popular mind, and that the chances of a satisfactory agreement on the naval question would undoubtedly be improved if the controversy surrounding these naval stations could be stilled once for all.3. A declaration to achieve this object was consequently drafted in the following terms : *&quot; Naval Stations.&quot; With a further view to reducing fear and the friction that comes from fear, we have obtained of our general Board of the Navy that the existing military and naval stations of Great Britain in the Western Hemisphere are not in a condition to be a menace to the United States. Great Britain will not hereafter establish any military or naval stations in her possessions in the Western Hemisphere, nor alter any such existing stations in such a way as in either case to become a menace to the United States.* Telegrams from Sir E. Howard to Mr. A. Henderson, Nos. 493 and 494, dated 6th October, 1929.[20239] B
Reciprocally, United States makes the same agreement as to the Eastern Hemisphere. It is understood, however, by both parties that the above declaration does not alter or supersede the provisions of article 19 of the Washington Treaty of 1922 for the limitation of naval armament.Such Western Hemisphere is to be defined as that portion of the globe lying west of 30 meridian and east of the 170 meridian, and Eastern Hemisphere as remainder of the globe.&quot; - 14. This declaration was considered by us at short notice on the 8th October, and, as stated in Mr. Henderson&apos;s telegram to Sir E. Howard on the same day (No. 5 in Appendix &quot; A &quot; to enclosure No. 1), we advised most strongly against any mention being included in the proposed public statement of the results of the Prime Minister&apos;s conversations which could be construed as implying our readiness to enter into an agreement that would potentially restrict our freedom of action whilst Imposing no parallel obligation on the United States. We pointed out that any undertaking which might preclude our bringing the garrisons of Jamaica and Bermuda up to their proper strengths again, if and when we desired to do so, would be a dangerous precedent. We also suggested that it was essential that if the world situation changed we should be free to&apos;re-establish the garrisons, which for financial reasons are now reduced to a nucleus, and to bring the defences up to date.5. In the present paper we submit in more detail the reasons underlying this advice.PART I.Can otjr Naval Stations at Bermuda and Jamaica be held to constitute a menace to the United States \History of Jamaica and Bermuda.6. From the year 1626, when the first British colony in the West Indies was established in Barbadoes, until the end of the 19th century, the history of the islands has been a reflex of the relative importance of the great colonising powers of Europe. As the wars raged back and forth in Europe, many of the national colonies and possessions in the Caribbean Sea changed hands between the Dutch, Spaniards, French and British, Barbadoes being the only British island in the West Indies over which no foreign flag has ever flown. &apos;7. The wars with France at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries represent the most critical period for the British West India possessions; in 1782 nearly every colony, with the exception of Jamaica and Barbadoes, was lost.The war of American Independence was concluded by the signature of the treaty of peace between Great Britain, the United States, France and Spain in 1783. Though a small American naval force had been instituted previously, it was not until the war of 1812-15 that the large and fast frigates of the United States navy became a factor of historical importance.8. It is evident, therefore, that the development of the West Indian possessions of the British Empire took place, and that the necessity for their protection and that of British trade by naval bases existed, before ever the United States of America became a nation; and, furthermore, that Jamaica and the Bermudas were used as bases against other colonising Powers, notably France, many years before the United States possessed a navy which was an international factor.9. In 1882, when the &quot;Carnarvon Commission&quot; reported on the &quot;defence of British Possessions and Commerce Abroad,&quot; war between Great Britain and the United States of America was a factor taken into consideration in the distribution of the British Naval Forces.The Report states that: &quot; 96. The United States would have immense facilities for interrunting our trade with the Dominion of Canada both by land and sea. In the event of war with any other maritime Power, the evidence points to the conclusion that merchant ships would require protection ,only near the coasts at either end, trusting to their own speed for the intermediate portion of the voyage.
97. War between Great Britain and the United States would mainly depend upon naval operations, in which case the fortified ports of Halifax and Bermuda would be of the first importance to your Majesty&apos;s navy as coaling-stations, and to merchant ships as harbours of refuge. Without ports in which to coal, your Majesty&apos;s ships could neither protect British trade&apos;in the western waters of the Atlantic nor act against the trade of the United States.&quot;Later, in regard to Jamaica, it is stated that &quot; the existing works are insufficient for its security .... the defences necessary to constitute it a safe harbour of refuge and to secure the town of Kingston against bombardment would cost  418,241 and require a garrison of 2,250 men.&quot;10. Twenty years afterwards, however, as shown below, our defensive arrange-ments in the Western Atlantic ceased to bear any relation to the possibility of war with the United States. In 1904 the Admiralty decided on a redistribution of the fleet, involving an increased concentration in home waters, and, as part of that policy, the naval bases in North America and the West Indies were reduced. The &quot;secondary naval base&quot; at St. Lucia was closed down altogether and the defences were abolished. The naval base at Port Royal, Jamaica, was also closed, and after 1906 the port was classified as &quot;a port of refuge for mercantile shipping in time of war&quot; and defended only against unarmoured cruiser attack. The naval base at Bermuda was cut down to a nucleus; a battalion was withdrawn; and in 1906 its protection was reduced to a defence against unarmoured cruiser attack.11. It is clear from the Minutes of the Committee of Imperial Defence (24th Meeting, November 25th, 1903) that even before the reorganisation of the fleet and its bases none of these ports were defended on a scale sufficient to resist an attack by the United States of America, and in July 1904 when, considering the garrisons of defended ports abroad, the Committee of Imperial Defence (48th Meeting) laid down that &apos;&apos; in the event of war with the United States it isclear that the Western coaling stations would not be defended by the garrisons atpresent allotted to them against expeditionary forces such as might be brought tobear if the British Navy were not able to be employed in full strength in the Western Atlantic.* From this point of view, therefore; very small garrisons are desirable.&quot; In the case of Bermuda, it was laid down at the same meeting that &quot;An attack from the United States need not be taken into consideration.&quot;12. In dealing with these changes in Parliament the Prime Minister of the day, Mr. Balfour, contented himself with justifying them owing to alterations in the general situation, but in the House of Lords the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Selborne, was more explicit. After pointing out that the whole naval situation had been revolutionised during recent years, he continued : &apos;* What is the change ? It is one of the most marvellous changes that has taken place in modern history. It is the rise of the American Navy.&quot;13. Since the reduction of these bases in the years 1904-6 there has been no change of policy. The United States of America have been left out of account in calculating the scale of naval establishments and defences, which have been maintained solely for the purpose of general trade protection. In this connection, the necessity for trade protection in the West Indies, both by means of warships and defended ports of refuge, was strikingly demonstrated during the great war in the case of the German commerce raider &quot;Karlsruhe,&quot; which was actually on her way to attack the British trade routes in these waters when, within three hundred miles of Barbados, she was sunk by an internal explosion.   (See Enclosure No. 6.)Bermuda and Jamaica- To-dav.14. At the present time the position is such that the word &quot;menace&quot; has become derisory. The naval force in the American West Indies station consists only of 5 cruisers and 2 sloops, and the station extends to the Pacific as well as to the Atlantic coasts of both Americas.   The dockyard at Bermuda is not equipped nor* The Admiralty had already indicated that this contingency was probable (C.I.D. Paper No. 3-C, Appendix (e)).[20239] b 2
supplied for the maintenance of ships larger than the 10,000-ton-cruiser class and certain aircraft carriers. A heavy expenditure spread over several years would be required before it could become an effective base for capital ships. The defences have not been brought up to date, and, given the peaceful outlook, the garrison has for financial reasons been reduced to a mere cadre.Kingston, Jamaica, is merely a defended naval anchorage and convoy assembly port.   It possesses no dockyard nor repair facilities.15. The strength and distribution of the Imperial garrisons in Bermuda and Jamaica are as shown in Enclosure No. 3, and the armament and lights are given in Enclosure No. 4. It will be seen that, with the exception of an examination battery of two 6-inch guns in Jamaica and Bermuda, manned by Militia artillery, all the existing defences are at present on a care and maintenance basis; no personnel exist to man the remaining guns. The 6-inch guns of the examination batteries are admittedly quite inadequate as a deterrent to an attack by battleships or even by cruisers, their maximum range being only 12,000 yards. In the present condition of the defences, therefore, additional artillery personnel would have to be introduced before protection could be afforded from attack by commerce-raiding cruisers of whatever nationality.Furthermore, if and when the political situation should deteriorate to an extent which would necessitate fully manning the existing defences of these bases, the protection afforded would even then only be sufficient to ensure them from attack by armed raiders and light cruisers, and it would be inadequate to deter attack by capital ships, or even by larger cruisers. For offensive purposes, as connoted by the term &quot;menace,&quot; there is not the smallest margin.16. As shown in Enclosure No. 3, in addition to the fixed defences which have already been reduced to a care and maintenance basis, one infantry battalion is maintained partly in Jamaica and partly in Bermuda. Although small, the garrison does supply some measure of deterrent to such forces as could be landed from a raiding cruiser, and the ports cannot be captured without the despatch of an organized expedition. The possibility of reinforcing the garrison and bringing it up to war requirements is also retained.From an internal security point of view, an infantry garrison in the West Indies will remain a necessity until the West Indian Colonies have organised an efficient force, either separately or collectively, capable of dealing with possible local disturbances.Naval Bases of the United States in the Western Atlantic.17. A list of the United States naval bases on the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea is given in Enclosure No. 5, and a comparison between the armament of these bases with those given in Enclosure No. 4 is of interest in that the American bases are all equipped with guns of at least 12-inch calibre, whereas the British bases, even when raised to their maximum scale of defence, are equipped with but two 9-2-inch guns in the case of Jamaica and one in that of Bermuda. How the Americans arrive at their scale of defence can, of course, only be a matter for surmise, but, as a guide, we may fairly base our assumptions on British standards, namely, that 12-inch guns and upwards are provided only at those ports which are considered liable to attack by modern battleships. As the United States of America have included 12-inch mortars, 12-inch, 14-inch and 16-inch guns in the defences of their naval bases, it can be assumed that these bases have been provided with defences designed to act as an adequate deterrent to a determined attack by modern battleships and cruisers. It will be noted that the naval bases mentioned in Enclosure No. 5 include the strongly-defended entrance to the Panama Canal, which places in the hands of the United States of America the key to the passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific.It is apparent, therefore, that the American General Staff are prepared to meet a very much higher scale of attack in these waters than are our own Naval Staff. It does not, however, require very expert knowledge to realise that, in view of the proximity to Bermuda or Jamaica of American naval bases, the elimination of any ship of war more formidable than a light cruiser from the scale of attack to which our own bases are assumed to be liable ipso facto rules out of consideration a war against America.
18. We note* that Mr. Hoover has extracted from the United States Navy Board &quot; a grudging admission that Bermuda and Jamaica constituted &apos; no appreciable menace &apos; to the United States.&quot;The preceding paragraphs will, we venture to suggest, demonstrate clearly that, owing to their very meagre fixed defences, their lack of repair facilities, &amp;o, for the larger classes of war vessels, and the absence of any appreciable garrison, these ports do not constitute, and have not for over a quarter of a century constituted, the slightestanenace to the United States. On the other hand, the American Fleet, with its naval bases fortified on a scale quite incommensurate with any conceivable scale of attack, must ever constitute a potential menace to the security of our West Indian Possessions.In these circumstances, any attempt to represent our stations in Bermuda and the West Indies as constituting a menace to the United States of America can only be based either upon complete ignorance or a distortion of the facts; and it is considered that to agree to such a representation would, of itself, be an unjustifiable admission of the correctness of an untrue assumption.PART II.The Importance of not Restricting our Right to Protect our Trade.Importance of West Indian Naval Stations to our Seaborne Trade.19. So long as it remains possible for a hostile Power to send warships out into the oceans to attack our commerce we must have bases from which our protecting craft can operate against these vessels, and defended ports where our shipping can take refuge when a raider is in the vicinity and where convoys can be formed. We would particularly stress the fact that these defended ports are not maintainedagainst any one nation, but against all nations that may become hostile. They are not necessarily a part of a particular war plan, but a provision against war in general, although, as will be seen from paragraph 13 above, the United States ofAmerica are specifically excluded.20. Bermuda is over 700 miles from the nearest point of United States territory, and within a radius of this distance 6^ million tons of British shipping, with cargoes valued at  80,000,000 (largely food stuffs) pass each month. If Bermuda is not sufficiently protected we might be deprived of the possibility of safeguarding this valuable trade. It is also to be noted that any dislocation or interruption of this trade would react on the United States herself, since a large proportion of the United States of America export trade is carried in British ships.21. Again, Jamaica is in an area where shipping would run grave risks in war with a naval Power as demonstrated by its narrow escape from the depredations of the &quot;Karlsruhe,&quot; referred to in paragraph 13. It is an area which might almost have been designed by nature to facilitate raiding activities, and through it passes every month some 5^ million tons of British shipping, carrying  72,000,000 worth of cargo.  These figures are steadily increasing.22. The Canadian ports have, we understand, been definitely excluded from the proposed Declaration. We would, however, in passing, draw attention to the fact that Halifax is the only ice-free Atlantic port in the Dominion of Canada capable of accommodating a convoy of merchant ships assembling prior to sailing, and that its use for this purpose would be essential to us in any war with a first-class naval Power.23. We trust that the preceding paragraphs have shown clearly that in war with any naval Power our bases at Jamaica and Bermuda would be of vital importance to the protection of our seaborne trade. Further, that in such an eventuality these bases must be equipped and defended with modern and up-to-date &quot;rearmament, not necessarily on a heavy scale. At present the defences are on a care ud maintenance basis.    Unless reinforced,  the existing garrisons would  be* Enclosure No. 1.
inadequate for defence even against light cruisers or armed merchant ships. We-are unable to foretell developments in coast defences or in ships&apos; armament for more than a few years ahead. It is, therefore, apparent that, if any Declaration such as has been suggested is made, no risk should be run of it being implied that we bind ourselves to the status quo, a status which amounts virtually to temporary disarmament for financial reasons.24. As the facts of the situation disclosed in Part I have in certain quarters been already distorted to constitute a menace to the United States, the installation of a new gun or the reintroduction of a few dozen gunners to man the existing guns might well be misinterpreted as being an alteration &apos;1 in such a way as to become a menace to the United States,&quot; and hence a breach of our agreement. If, for political reasons, it should be considered unavoidable to make some declaration, it is of the first importance that we should retain our liberty to bring the defences up to date and to provide a sufficient garrison, and that the formula should be cast m sufficiently wide terms to permit of the installation of the latest or of future weapons and accessories for coast defence, such as aircraft.PART III.Other Considerations.25. In the foregoing paragraphs we have dealt with considerations of a purely military nature. It is evident, however, that many other factors of a combined political and military nature have to be taken into account in deciding whether there is a balance in favour of issuing a statement of the nature proposed.The Proposed Declaration may Create a Dangerous Precedent.26. The possible reaction of the proposed Declaration on the position of British naval bases in other waters must be borne in mind. If Bermuda can be considered as a menace to the United States, may not Prance and Italy look on Malta as a menace to them, and could not all the Mediterranean Powers say the same of Gibraltar 1 It is unnecessary to point out that our occupation of these places is essential to the security of our Mediterranean and eastern trade routes.27. The suggested reaction of any undertaking in respect of Jamaica and Bermuda on Malta and Gibraltar is by no means far fetched. This year, prior to the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to America, a Deputy in the French Parliament actually made the suggestion that Malta and Gibraltar should be demilitarized as a gesture of friendliness towards France and Italy. We suggest that it might be difficult to explain that, whilst war between ourselves and the United States was agreed to be unthinkable, the same phrase could not be applied to our future relations with France and Italy.The fact is that with our world-wide responsibilities, quite apart from those in connection with the local defence of outlying territories, the question of the defence of the homeland cannot be confined to the shores of Great Britain. The provision of naval bases on the sea routes between the constituent portions of the Empire means to us precisely the same as does the provision of naval bases on the shores of her own continent to America.Reasons Underlying the American Demand for the Proposed Declaration.28. Although President Hoover&apos;s request was undoubtedly made in good faith, it is difficult to believe that it is wholly disconnected with earlier American policy of an anti-British nature. The attitude of the United States to our possessions and those of other Powers in Central America and the West Indies is well expressed by Secretary 01ney&apos;s famous declaration that &quot;distance and 3,000 miles of intervening ocean make any permanent political union between a European and an American State unnatural and inexpedient,&quot; and that &quot;the United States is practically sovereign of this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition.&quot; These views are confirmed by President Roosevelt&apos;s statement:   &quot; I should myself like to shape our foreign policy with a purpose
ultimately of driving off this continent every European Power. I would begin with Spain, and in the end would take all other European nations, including England.....&quot;29. That these words were no empty phrase is shown by the history of the American war with Spain, and American intervention in Panama, Nicaragua, Cuba and San Domingo, besides the questions of Alaska, Venezuela and the Mosquito Coast. In almost every case military force was either used or was threatened in order to further the strategic interests of the United States. The logical and obvious aim of a policy which has led to such results is, as Roosevelt states, the complete subjuga-tion of the Caribbean Sea to American interests and the elimination of the only remaining European possessions of importance in that area, namely, the British West Indies. The well-prepared propaganda in favour of selling the West Indies to the United States after the war, commercial penetration and discrimination in matters of trade, have the appearance of being directed towards getting these Islands sooner or later into the orbit of the United States. It does not seem beyond the bounds of possibility that the present suggestion is merely another step in the same direction, and is possibly an attempt to forestall the union of the West Indies with Canada, which is regarded by some long-sighted people as the logical solution of their present problems. In this connection it might be pointed out that the strategical and commercial interests of Canada in the Panama Canal may eventually be nearly as great as those of the United States&apos; themselves. There is, furthermore, a section of the population of the United States of America which is admittedly hostile to the British Empire, and would be as desirous of dealing a blow to our prestige by a demonstration of our inability to defend our own colonies, as they would be to promote the acquisition by America of Bermuda and our possessions in the Caribbean Sea, whether by force or by economic absorption.What will the Colonies think?30. The above factors lead us to the consideration of the interests of the West Indian Colonies themselves. In this respect the General Staff has a peculiar responsibility, owing to the fact that the West Indies do not constitute a self-governing Dominion with a General Staff of their own. We suggest that so long as the small nations in Central America and the West Indies consider that measures&apos; of self-defence are an essential requirement of a state of independence, then so long should the adequate defence of these colonies be provided for unless they themselves voluntarily relinquish it.One of the results of neglect in this respect was strikingly demonstrated by the incident which occurred on the Dutch island of Curacoa in June of this year. Several hundred fugitive insurgents from Venezuela seized a quantity of arms and ammunition and an American steamer at Willemstadt. The Governor and Commandant of Willemstadt were not only powerless to deal with the revolutionaries, but were forced to accompany the latter as hostages when they departed on a filibustering expedition to Coro. As a result of these events a Dutch cruiser and destroyer have been sent to Curacoa.The restriction of defensive measures, unless reciprocal with surrounding territories, might well appear to the inhabitants as the first step towards the abandonment of independence. Any evidence or implication of a weakening in our resolution to defend these territories in the event of war might eventually incline local sentiment towards those Powers that will. It seems open to question on grounds of equity whether we should abandon on behalf of our Colonies even the smallest right of self-defence, which some of the Colonies would not abandon of their own ree will, and which we are evidently unwilling to press on a Dominion (vide &quot;nclosure No. 2).31. Agreement to a reduction in our cruiser numbers at the approaching ive-Power Naval Conference is contemplated. It is obvious that the fewer the ships available for the protection of our trade, the more urgent the need for efficient bases po as to allow the ships we have got to refuel, refit, and replenish with speed and in afety, in order that they may return to their work with the least possible loss of une.  The close connection between bases and the number of commerce protecting
cruisers required is well illustrated by the case of St. Lucia (see paragraph 10) during the Great War. In 1914-15 it was found necessary, owing to the lack of coast defences at that port, to assign one out of three available cruisers for local protection.32. It will be recalled that one of the main arguments of the United States for the addition of a considerable number of cruisers of the 10,000-ton type to their Navy has been the fact that the British Empire possesses a number of naval bases in different parts of the world. It has been tentatively agreed to allow the United States a greater number of such vessels on these grounds. In the circumstances, it would appear to be essential to ensure that we do not surrender the right to render our naval bases capable of performing the work for which they are intended in the event of our being involved in war with a maritime Power. Otherwise, such con-cessions as are made to the United States in regard to large cruisers will, in effect, be doubly conceded.Naval Facilities of Other Powers in the Caribbean Sea.33. So far as we are aware no suggestion has yet been made that other Powers besides ourselves possessing Naval Bases in the West Indies should make similar engagements to maintain the status quo, and we cannot refrain, in passing, from drawing attention to the fact that the only &quot;menace&quot; which appears to have attracted attention is supposed to emanate from the one Power which has stated emphatically its intention to avoid war with the United States of America.34. Both France and Holland possess naval bases in the West Indies. The former has defended ports at Guadeloupe and Martinique, and the latter at Curacoa (Willemstadt) and Dutch Guiana (Paramaribo).Fort of France, in the Island of Martinique, is accessible to any type of ship, and could accommodate some 10 cruisers and 12 capital ships. The defences were reorganised in 1902-04, when guns of heavy calibre were mounted. The guns were, however, dismounted and sent to France during the Great War. It is reported that the forts are to be rearmed on a scale to resist attack by light craft and surprise landings, and a comparison with their previous armament, the maximum calibre of which was 10-8&quot;, would seem to place this port in the same category as regards defence as Bermuda and Jamaica, although the number of guns actually at Martinique in 1915 was considerably greater than at either of the British ports.35. It may be safely assumed that French views coincide with our own as to the necessity for being in a position to protect their Colonies and overseas trade by the provision of bases from which their naval forces can operate. War with France, Italy or Japan is at the present time a most unlikely contingency, yet, to take any action which has the appearance of leaving the security of our West Indian possessions and trade entirely dependent on the goodwill of another nation, without any appreciable quid fro quo (irrespective of what ultimate conditions the change in times may produce), would involve a lowering of our prestige, whilst it might in the distant future prove to be a real danger.The Possibility of a Future War.36. It may perhaps be thought that we have attached undue weight to the possibility of a future war, and have left out of account the various organisations existing to-day for the settlement of disputes by pacific means. This is not the case. We have already made it clear that our West Indian possessions are now entirely at the mercy of the United States Forces, and we have not suggested that any means of protection against these forces should be provided.We have, however, admittedly been constantly faced with the fact that the attitude of the United States of America in regard to defence in general and to coast defence in particular (vide Enclosure No. 5), is clearly based not only on the possibility of a future war, but on the possibility of a scale of naval attack which, in present world conditions, could not be brought against them.
Conclusions.37.   Our main conclusions may be summarised as follows :  (a.) Bermuda and Jamaica, our existing Naval Stations, possess defences on so low a scale, and naval facilities so limited, that, even if they were main-tained at full establishment, they cannot by any stretch of imagination be justifiably regarded as a menace, actual or potential, to the United States or to any other country. The defences are, however, at present on a &quot; care and maintenance basis.&quot; Even when fully manned, the defences of these ports, as compared with those of the American naval bases in the Atlantic, are almost negligible (Paragraphs 6-18).(b.) In considering the policy of whether a statement is to be made or not, we ask that His Majesty&apos;s Government will bear the following considera-tions in mind : (i.) That, in the event of war with any maritime Power, adequately defended bases for vessels employed on protection of our trade would be indispensable (Paragraphs 19-24). (ii.) That, in acceding to President Hoover&apos;s demand in the case of our Possessions in North America and the West Indies, a precedent will be set up which might prove highly inconvenient in relation ; to other Powers in other parts of the world, e.g., the Mediterranean (Paragraphs 26 and 27). (iii.) The effect of the Declaration on the West Indian Colonies. To have no bases for trade protection vessels in Bermuda and Jamaica would place our West  India possessions  in a position of dependence upon any and all other nations possessing, or in the future acquiring, bases in those waters, a condition from which it is inconceivable that pur prestige could recover (Paragraph 30).(c.) If it should be considered unavoidable for political reasons to make a Declaration, the following points, which are not, in our opinion, sufficiently provided for in the draft declaration quoted in paragraph 3, should specifically be safeguarded, viz. : (i.) That, while there is not the smallest intention to create a menace to the United States of America, we must reserve the right to bring the equipment of the existing dockyards, defences and garrison up to date, including the provision, from time to time, of such new weapons or methods as may be devised, and that the same principle must apply to any new naval, military or air establishment which, at some future day, might be required in connection with our general arrangements ror defence (Paragraphs 20-23). (ii.) Measures regarded as necessary for bringing our defensive arrange-ments up to date, even if they are long postponed, must not be treated as a breach of our undertaking not to create a menace to the United States of America (Paragraph 24).&apos;(Signed)        H.

ENCLOSURE No. 1.[Paper No. C.O.S. 204.]Extract from a Memorandum respecting Conversations between the Prime Minister and President Hoover at Washington (October 4-10, 1929) (Paper No. OP. 312 (29)).rfe $fc ijfc -v4&quot; ffe ^III.-BRITISH NAVAL STATIONS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.In introducing this subject the President observed that our naval stations in proximity to the United States had been made the pretext for a good deal of hostile propaganda against the idea of a naval agreement with ourselves. Those who were opposed to an understanding alleged that the possession of these naval stations gave to the British Empire a great strategical advantage of which account should be taken in any naval agreement, and the reiteration of this view by those favouring a. big American navy had undoubtedly had its effect in the country as a whole. No responsible authority in the United States regarded these stations as a real menace to the United States, but there was a great deal of misapprehension on the subject in the popular mind, and the chances of a satisfactory agreement on the naval question would undoubtedly be improved if this controversy surrounding those naval stations could be stilled once for all. Mr. Hoover said that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to declare that Great Britain had no intention of causing her stations! in the Western Hemisphere to be a menace to the United States, the United States Government would make a similar declaration in regard to their stations in the Eastern Hemisphere. Mr. Hoover admitted frankly that this quid pro quo would be of little use to us, except as a matter of form, because the United States had only one naval station in the Eastern Hemisphere, namely, Corregidor, in the Philippines, and this was already covered by article 19 of the Treaty of 1922 for the Limitation of Naval Armament. He hoped that, nevertheless, we would consider the matter carefully.I replied that our naval stations at Bermuda and in the Caribbean were only fortified to the extent necessary to defend them against raiders or a weak force, and could not by any flight of the imagination be regarded as a menace to the United States. Nevertheless, I took note of what the President had said about the use which was being made of the existence of these stations by those who were opposed to a naval agreement. We had, of course, no intention of so modifying the existing fortifications or establishments as to turn them into a menace to the United States, and I did not believe there could be any serious objection to placing this absence of intention on record. But I thought that we ought to begin with a definite statement from the American side that these stations were not regarded at present as a menace by the Government of the United States. Mr. Hoover promised to secure a statement to this effect from the United States Navy Board, though he added somewhat grimly that this would probably be no easy task. He proved, indeed, to be right, and several days of wrestling were necessary to extract from them a grudging admission that Bermuda and Jamaica constituted &quot;no appreciable menace&quot; to the United States. This incident illustrates the mentality with which the President and the Secretary of State have to cope.When the question of Halifax was mentioned, I said that this was a matter for the Canadian Government, and I could not anticipate at all what their view would be. The Caribbean and the Canadian naval stations seemed to me to be in quite separate categories, and the difficulty as regards the latter appeared to be that Canada might reasonably expect some corresponding declaration from the American side in regard to naval stations in the United States in proximity to the Canadian-United States frontier. On this latter point, it was intimated to me that there was little prospect of any declaration being forthcoming in regard to United States naval stations in the Western Hemisphere.A formula was accordingly drafted which limited the scope of the declaration to the naval stations of Great Britain in the Western Hemisphere and to those of the United States in the Eastern Hemisphere. This formula was transmitted to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Sir E. Howard&apos;s telegram No. 493 of the 6th October (Appendix A), but having regard to certain considerations advanced by the Chiefs of Staff, I eventually decided that the matter must wait over until I had returned to London and had had an opportunity of explaining more fully to my
colleagues than was possible by telegram the purpose and scope of what was proposed.As in the case of the maritime rights, so in the case of the naval stations question, Mr. Hoover was greatly disappointed that nc public declaration could be made on this subject at the termination of my visit to Washington. Psychologically speaking, an opportunity for producing the maximum of effect in the United States has been missed. Nevertheless, the wording of the formula was clearly a matter which required care and deliberation, and I came to the conclusion that, on balance, it would be preferable to postpone the matter until I had been able to consult more fully with my colleagues and the Chiefs of Staff.* * &apos; * * * *Appendix A to Enclosure No. 1.

Great Britain will not here-after establish any military or naval stations in her possessions in the Western Hemisphere, nor alter any such existing stations in such a way as in either case to become a menace to the United States.&quot; &apos; Reciprocally, United States makes the same agreement as to Eastern Hemisphere. It is understood, however, by both parties that the above declaration does not alter or supersede the provisions of article 19 of the Washington treaty of 1922 for the limitation of naval armament.&quot; &apos; Such Western Hemisphere is to be defined as that portion of the globe lying west of 30 meridian and east of the 170 meridian, and Eastern Hemisphere as remainder of the globe.&apos;** * * * *No. 5.I Copy of a Telegram from Mr. A. Henderson to Sir E. Howard (Washington),No. 505 of October 8, 1929.MY immediately preceding telegram.The Chiefs of Staff met this morning to consider your telegrams Nos. 493 I and 494.They agree with the General Navy Board of the United States that existing I military and naval stations of Great Britain in the Western Hemisphere are not in I a condition to be a menace to the United States, and this view is one that has often I been expressed by them.As regards the future of such naval stations in the Western Hemisphere, they advise most strongly against any mention being included in the proposed statement that could be construed as implying our readiness to enter into an agreement which would potentially restrict our freedom of action in our own possessions whilst imposing no parallel obligation on the United States, for the reason that that country has no such possessions in the Eastern Hemisphere except the Philippines covered by the Washington Treaty.It must be realised that our garrisons in Bermuda and the West Indies have been (for financial reasons) deliberately allowed to fall below a figure which would even admit of their manning the existing armament. Any undertaking which might preclude our bringing these garrisons up to their proper strengths again, if and when we desire to do so, would be a dangerous precedent. Our establishments in Bermuda and the West Indies are maintained quite irrespective of the United States [20239] . d
in connexion with, the general arrangements for trade protection. It is essential that, if the world situation changes, we should be free to re-establish the garrisons which are reduced to a nucleus and to bring the defences up to date. The proposed statement as worded does not cover Canadian naval establishments in Canada, but similar arguments would, in the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff, be applicable to them.As regards rights and immunities at sea, the Chiefs of Staff are of opinion that on a question of such vital importance to the Empire nothing whatever should appear in the statement to be issued which could be taken at this stage as being even the most partial surrender of our belligerent rights at sea.They invite attention to the reports of the recent enquiry by the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which Mr. Jones has copies. After exhaustive enquiry the main conclusions reached were that belligerent rights should be maintained as high as possible and that international discussion of the question should be avoided if possible.The Chiefs of Staff are seriously concerned at the prospect of any statement being made which might commit His Majesty&apos;s Government prematurely to a course of action in a grave matter of Imperial defence, and urge that you yourself should reserve judgment until this most complicated and controversial subject has been re-examined by your Government, and the Dominions consulted.In any event, they beg that you will secure the omission from the statement of the passage suggesting exemption of food-stuffs from blockade. They would remind vou that food-stuffs can be converted into munitions of war.ENCLOSURE No. 2.Extract from a Memorandum respecting Conversations between Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and Mr. Mackenzie King during the Visit to Ottawa (October 17-20, 1929) (Paper No. CP. 313 (29)).* * * * * -*II. Naval Stations in the Western Hemisphere.In explaining to Mr. Mackenzie King what had occurred at Washington, I made it clear that our proposed formula related only to stations under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and that such discussion as occurred with reference to Halifax was only designed to ascertain what was in the mind of Mr. Hoover and his advisers in order that the Canadian Government might be fully apprised of the situation.Mr. Mackenzie King saw no objection at all to the formula which I proposed in regard to the stations in the Caribbean area. He added that the Canadian Government would be perfectly prepared to make a similar declaration in regard to Halifax and Vancouver, subject to the right of effecting &apos;&apos; the necessary improve-ments and modernisation of these ports to meet the needs of Canadian defence and to facilitate the maintenance of Canadian neutrality&quot; (see telegram from British High Commissioner to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington of the 8th October  Appendix A). He made it clear, however, that Canada would require a corresponding declaration from the United States owing to the proximity of United States naval stations to the Canadian-United States border a consideration which did not arise in the case of Great Britain. Mr. Mackenzie King indeed intimated plainly that no Canadian Government could dispense with such reciprocity and hope to survive. As I had been given to understand at Washington that there was little chance of the United States Government seeing their way to make a corresponding declaration, we came to the conclusion that any public statement which might ultimately be made on this subject would probably have to be confined to the Caribbean area. Before our departure from Washington, Colonel Stimson had requested Sir Robert Vansittart to let him know the view adopted by the Canadian Government on this point as soon as.possible after Mr. Mackenzie King and I had talked the matter over. A letter informing the United States Secretary of State of the Canadian attitude was accordingly drafted at the meeting and despatched on the 19th October.  The text of this letter appears as Appendix B.
Appendix A to Enclosure No. 2.Extract from Telegram from British High Commissioner, Ottawa, to Sir E. Howard,No. 15 of October 8, 1929.* ife ik * *&quot; Canadian Government observes that Mr. ramsay MacDonald proposes that Great Britain will not hereafter establish any military or naval stations in her possessions in the western hemisphere nor alter any such existing stations in such a way as in either case will become a menace to the United States. Canadian Government will if [ ? necessary] make a similar declaration in respect of Canadian territory. Necessary improvements and modernisation of Canadian Pacific and Atlantic ports to meet needs of Canadian defence and to facilitate maintenance of Canadian neutrality are understood to be, as they are intended, not a menace of any kind to the United States.&quot;* * * * * &apos;*Appendix B to Enclosure No. 2. Extract from a Letter from Sir R. Vansittart to Mr. Stimson. * * * * * * *The Prime Minister also discussed the question of the naval stations. It is, I think, clear from further close examination that the plan for the division of the world into two hemispheres will not be workable, and we shall have to think out some other way of laying the &quot; ghost &quot; of the so-called menace of the naval stations.The Canadian Government are willing in principle to announce simultaneously and jointly with us that their naval stations are not, and are not intended to be, a menace to the United States. This, however, could only be done if the same statement were made reciprocally by the United States. If this is, in your view, impossible, the agreement would then be confined to the Caribbean area. The wording of this statement would, as arranged, be settled between us. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald will go into this matter immediately upon his return to London.* * * * * *[20239]

This was the &quot; Vandyck,&quot; then bound from Buenos Aires to New York, and, besides over. 200 passengers, mostly American, she was carrying mails, treasure and a rich general, cargo, including 1,000 tons of frozen meat. It was an extraordinary stroke of fortune. Having been warned by the &quot;Bristol&quot; after passing Rio, she was keeping away from the route, and using no light or wireless. It was. a pure chance thafthe &quot;&quot;Karlsruhe &quot; fell in with her in changing stations, and the worst of it. was that she was by far the finest prize the lucky raider had yet encountered. The ship was retained till she could be gutted, but next day (the 27th October) the passengers, together with thef crews of the last two prizes
taken on the old ground, &quot; Glanton &quot; and &quot; Hurstdale,&quot; were crowded into the &quot;Asuncion,&quot; which was sent away to Para with orders not to make the port till the 1st November. During the night, as the &quot; Karlsruhe &quot; was taking in provisions from the &quot; Vandyck,&quot; another ship came quietly up to them and was taken. She was the &quot; Royal Sceptre &quot; of London, with a cargo of coffee valued at a quarter of a million; but it was neutral, and as the ship was old and worn out they had to let her go.  At daylight the &quot; Vandyck &quot; was sunk.Captain Kohler then proceeded on his way. His intention was, besides making surprise attacks on British and French possessions, to disturb the trade routes to Trinidad and Barbados. It was at the latter place he meant to make his first attempt. He knew there were several large passenger steamers lying there, and was calculating on a resounding blow to our prestige like those which the &apos;&apos; Emden &apos;&apos; had dealt in the East Indies. On the 1st November he coaled from the &quot; Farn,&quot; and, leaving her behind, carried on for his objective with the &quot;Rio Negro&quot; and &quot; Indrani.&quot; By sunset on the 4th November they were only 300 miles short of Barbados, and in high expectation of what lay before them. Captain Kohler was on the fore-bridge, and the greater part of the crew were assembled forward to listen to the band, when suddenly a terrible explosion shattered the ship. There were cries of &apos;&apos; Torpedoed,&apos;&apos; but as the flame and smoke cleared it was seen that the whole fore part had been blown off, and with it had gone the captain, one lieutenant and 259 petty officers and men. For twenty minutes more the after-part floated  just long enough for the tenders to take off all the survivors, to the number of 17 officers and 129 petty officers and men and then all was over. The cause of the tragedy is a mystery that cannot be solved, nor was it till a month later, when the &quot;Rio Negro&quot; with the survivors succeeded in evading our blockade and reaching home, that it was known, even in Germany, that the &quot;Karlsruhe &quot; was no longer a danger to our trade. Even then her fate was kept secret, and for long after she had ceased to exist she continued to occupy our cruisers and hamper our dispositions. The measure of success she had achieved was too great for her possibilities of further damage to be ignored. In the three months of her career as a commerce raider she had taken or sunk sixteen British vessels, and one Dutch on British charter. Their gross burden totalled over 76,000 tons. The value of ships and cargo was over a million and a half, and with our West Indian cruisers preoccupied with watching the Canal, she might well have added considerably to the total. As it was, by the time the great combination for dealing with Admiral von Spee was well on foot, one source of complication was removed, and within a few days, at the other end of the world, another clearance had been made.
