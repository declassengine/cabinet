THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1930.SECRET. Oopy No.      66CP. 7 (30).CABINET.ECONOMIC ADVISORY COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.THE attached memorandum embodies the results of conversations which I have recently had with a group of representative business men and economists. It will be recalled that in 1924 we had under consideration the appointment of an economic advisory council. This proposal was modified by the subsequent Government, who in 1925 set up the Committee of Civil Research. Its functions and operations were described in a Memorandum on the organisation of the Cabinet Office circulated in June 1929 (OP. 153 (29)). I propose that this body should be absorbed in the Economic Advisory Council which I recommend should be established forthwith on the lines indicated in the following paper.(Initialled) J. R.
