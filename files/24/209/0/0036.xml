23513qjW,UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC y^^STYl&amp;^OVmi^ljT^Copy No.CABINET.P,.. 37.130)..DISTPvSSSJ^^AJRmS^.Withdrawal of benefit from men refusing toattend a training, centre.Memorandum   by   the   Minister   of   Labour.There are a number of men, chiefly young men, in the distressed areas who are very unlikely to obtain work either locally or elsewhere without some course of reconditioning or training, but who refuse to avail themselves of the offer of training.I think the stage has been reached in the process of &quot;draining the water-logged areas&quot; when such men should have their benefit disallowed if they refuse without good reason to take a course of instruction when it is offered to them. The proportion of men who after passing through the centres are placed in employment is so high, and the conditions existing in the centres as to allowances, instruction, arrangements for lodging etc., are so well adapted to meet all reasonable requirements of the men during training that I have no hesitation in feeling that strong pressure ought to be put on the class of men whom I have in mind to attend the centres.       Their numbers are not large.I have consulted the Trades Union Congress General Council on the point and they fully approve in principle.       They make the reservation that the procedure proposed should not be applied to attendance at the handymen centres, but only to attendance at the transfer instructional (&quot;reconditioning1&apos;) centres.
The procedure whioh I contemplate is that if a man for whom a course of instruction at a transfer instructional centre is thought to be necessary refuses without good reason to take it, he should be brought before the local Board of Assessors, and, if they agree, he would be told that unless he takes the course, benefit would be with-held,       If, after going to the centre, he leaves it without a good reason before the end of the course, he will again be brought before the Board of Assessors and if they approve, benefit will be disallowed.       This procedure should provide sufficient safeguard against any risk of harsh treatment.As regards the handyman training centres and the Trade Union Congress reservation I do not propose to apply any pressure at present to induce unwilling men to enter this kind of centre; there is a large supply of volunteers.      If, however, a man who has entered, leaves without good reason, it will be advisable to bring his case also before the Board of Assessors.It will be necessary for me to make and lay on the Table of the House a formal regulation as to attendance at courses of instruction amending certain existing regulations under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.        This I propose to do at once, but I wish the Cabinet to be informed of the action I am taking.Ministry of Labour. 3rd, February^ ,1950.(Intd. ) M.G.B.
