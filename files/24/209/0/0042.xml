TjOOUMBMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos; 5 GOVERNMENT.-     M n In .....5(30)CABINET. THE TARIFF TRUCE. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,My colleagues will be aware that, at the last session of the Assembly of the League of Nations, there was carried, on my proposal, a resolution providing for the holding of a Conference early this year (1) to arrange a &quot;tariff truce&quot; - that is, an undertaking by the States concerned not to raise their protective tariffs during a period of two or three years, in order to create a favourable atmosphere for the carrying on of further negotiations to secure a general reduction of tariffs, and (2) to draw up a programme for these subsequent negotiations.26 countries besides ourselves, including France, Germany, Italy and Belgium have agreed to take active part in the Conference - in fact, the whole, of Europe except Albania and the Soviet Government.    Only two States outside Europe are taking an active part (Japan is one).    Of the dominions, only the Irish Free State is taking part in the Conference; but a telegram from them states that this Is to protect their own Interests and that they are not in favour of the tariff truce (No.4 of 29th January to Secretary of State for Dominions), as indeed they made apparent at Geneva.The Council of the League has decided that the Conference\shall meet at Geneva on the 17th February; it has already been announced that I shall head the British delegation.    A draftConvention has been prepared by the Economic Committee of theLeague as a basis for the work of the Conference.    This draftprovides, generally, that as from a date to be fixed, States willnot raise their import or export duties, or increase anyprotective elements In other duties.    Three classes of exceptionsare provided, (i) for purely fiscal duties; (il) for otherexceptions, general or special, for which particular States mayobtain the approval of the. Conference, and (iii) for measures-1--
necessitated by grave emergencies &quot;affecting essential factors of their economic life&quot;.   Any dispute arising under the Convention is, under the terms of the draft, to be settled by conciliation or arbitrations   Finally there is a provision, similar to that embodied in the Prohibitions Convention, whereby State,s may make their ratifications dependent on those of certain other States (to be enumerated in the Convention). The period of duration of the Truce has been left open.Generally, it appears that we could accept the Convention as it stands, subject to certain drafting amendments, to a satisfactory definition of &quot;fiscal duties&quot;, and to the fixing of a short period for its duration.The principal matters which call for comment are:-(1) As regards the date as from which the then existingduties are to be taken as the maximum, the resolution of theAssembly, which was adopted on 20th September last, contemplatesan agreement &quot;not to Increase protective,, tariffs above theirpreBent level&quot;.   The Economic Committee of the League, whoprepared the draft Convention, observed that according to theletter of the Assembly1s resolution, the date should be 1stOctober, 1929 j but they recognised that this might involvedifficulties, and did not suggest any specific date in their draft,   A number of States, including Germany and Italy, have since then made certain increases of their tariffs, and if theConference is not to split on this issue, I do not think anyearlier date than the opening of the Conference can be adopted.Later dates than this should, I think, be resisted.(2) As regards the three classes of exceptions:-(i) I have agreed in principle with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer a definition of fiscal duties.    This would cover,first, duties on goods of which there is no home production:secondly, duties on goods of which there Is home production,provided the latter is subject to an effective countervailingexcise duty; and thirdly, certain exceptions to be listed, notfalling strictly within the first or second categories.-2-   t
as regards the sugar and silk duties, the Chancellor is satisfied that there will be no occasion to raise these during the Truce, and accordingly it is not proposed to treat them as fiscal (an attempt to schedule the eilk duties as fiscal might indeed endanger the success of the Conference).    It will be necessary to schedule the oil, tobacco and wine duties, but I do not anticipate that this will excite serious opposition. The beer and spirit duties obviously fall within the definition of &quot;fiscal&quot;.How far the proposed definition will prove acceptable to other countries remains to be seen.    Many of them may ask for rather greater latitude, but it will only be possible to judge of their proposals when they are brought forward at the Conference.(ii) Coming to the category of exceptions it seems not unlikely that other countries will bring forward a number ofexceptions, avd if the list is formidable and largely prejudicial to our exporting interests we should presumably refuse toassent.    So far as we are concerned we shall have to explain the position of the key industry duties, though no realexception Is entailed.    The position is that by certain Actsduties are imposed on specified categories of goods, but the drawing up of the lists under these headings is left to theadministration, who are also empowered to grant temporaryexemptions from duty in defined circumstances.   From time totime revision of the lists means the addition of some items andthe removal of others, and temporary exemptions may be allowedto lapse.   We should not, however, make any claim to alter therate of duty or scope of the categories in the Acts.Consequently, there would seem to be no real exception to theprinciple of the tariff truce.     Further, it will no doubt benecessary to arrange for the substitution of duties for existingprohibitions, particularly in view of the Abolition ofProhibitions Convention.    The only important British prohibitionin question in this connection is that imposed by the Bye stuffs-3-
Act.The effect of the Truce, then, so far as we are concerned, will be to debar us during it from raising the Safeguarding, Mdlenna, silk, sugar and hop duties and some minor duties (namely dried fruits, chicory, roasted coffee and playing cards) or, subject to the points raised above, to impose new duties of a protective character.(iii) The exception dealing with emergencies is, I fear, an unwelcome necessity.(3) The provision for arbitral jurisdiction in tariff matters is, of course, novel, but I propose to resist so far as possible attempts to whittle it down.(4) As regards conditional ratification, I think we would not properly take part in a Truce to which Germany, France and Italy were not parties, and I propose that our ratification shall be made conditional on those of these countries (this will meet one pre-occupation of the Associated Chambers of Commerce).(5) For the duration of the Truce, I originally proposed two years; and this should I suggest, be adhered to; a longer period might raise certain constitutional difficulties, and would lessen the likelihood of the Truce proving acceptable in Great Britain.It is vital of course that the Conference should arrange for iiegotiations to follow for the reduction of trade barriers. Without this there is a fear that the opposition to the truce would be serious here.I would ask my colleagues for a general approval of the line I propose to take, as summarised above.We must not be blind to the possibility of difficulties arising at the Conference.    It is known that influential bodies in many countries are opposed to the proposal, and, even if the principle is accepted, exceptions of excessive number and scope may be demanded.      Some concessions will
almost certainly have to be made, but how far we should be justified in going in this respect can only be judged at the Conference.   And there is the further possibility that a Convention might be signed, and that yet some of the ratifications, on which other States&apos; ratifications may be made conditional, might not be forthcoming, thus preventing the Truce from coming into force.    I shall do what I can to keep the list of countries, whose ratification may thus be made essential, within reasonable limits, but the possibility of difficulties in this direction cannot be excluded.It may indeed be found eventually that difficulties connected, for example, with the exceptions demanded, would render unlikely the conclusion of a formal Convention, and in this event it might be necessary to resort Instead to some resolution in general terms, whereby the participant States would undertake to abstain, as far as possible, from increasing their protective duties for a short period, during which consideration would be given to the problem of securing an all-round reduction of tariffs.W.gId of Trade, 8th February, 1930.
