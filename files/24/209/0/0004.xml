THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS. BHI TACTIC M.4JESTY&apos;S GOVERKMENT).SECRET. - 13- COPYJTC ,___*SOCP. 4 (30) .CABINET. CHILDREN  (EMPLOYMENT ABROAD)  BILL. Note by the Lord President of the Council.I desire to draw the attention of ny colleagues to the urgency of passing into law the Children (Employment Abroad) Bill, which received the approval of the House of Lords in the Autumn Session and was sent down to the House of Commons on November 12th.The Bill extends the age for special protection of children seeking employment abroad, particularly in theatrical and other entertainments, from 16 to 18 years. The protection up to 16 years which was instituted by the Children (Employment Abroad) Act,. 1913,. has in every way worked well, but several occasions have arisen of young persons between 16 and IS being decoyed abroad by promises of employment, and social workers emphasise the desirability of putting an end to a practice which conduces to the terrible evil of the white slave traffic.     The Bill has the support of all persons who have knowledge of the methods of this traffic and desire to put an end to it. It received practically universal assent in the House of Lords, and I do not think that there will be any opposition&quot; on the further stages in the House of Commons.I am aware of the present congestion of Parlia-mentary business, but hope nevertheless opportunity may be found to pass the Bill into law at a very early date.I should like to have authority to confer with the Chief Whip with.a view to the necessary facilities being given.(Sgd.)    PARMOOR.7th January, 1930.
