THIS TO00M3NT IS THIS PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.C R E T. Copy Bo. 3 t &apos;. 25(30l.-- C A B I B 3 T.Agricultural Marketing Bill. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 15th January, 1950, Cabinet Z (30) Conclusion 2(d), I circulate for tne consideration of my colleagues particulars of my proposals for ah Agricultural Marketing Bill.     The general outline of the Scheme is as follows:-The object is to facilitate the organisation of producers into associations or corporations under their own control and, subject to appropriate safeguards, for greater unity of effort in marketing.This would be achieved by legislation in t&quot;-o related ways:-(a) Statutory Marketing Boards.    By providing that if any scheme for the creation of a district or central board designed to regulate the supply or sale of any agricultural commodity produced in Great Britain and/or to regulate any financial, storage and other operations incidental thereto, including manufacturing and any measures designed for the prevention and control of surpluses, is submitted to the Minister by any voluntary association or other persons appearing to the Minister to be substantially representative in any district or generally as the case may be of the producers and of the greater part of the output of that commodity, the Minister may, if he is satisfied that the scheme is calculated to secure for the producers the more efficient marketing of that commodity, approve the scheme with or without modification and every scheme so approved shall have statutory effect.    That is to say,  it shall be the statutory duty of every producer of that commodity in the district orgenerally
generally as the case may be, unless exempted by the terms of the scheme or by the board, to conform to the terms of the scheme. Where a board alleges that any producer is not complying with the terms of the scheme to the injury of the board, it may apply to a County Court Judge who,  if he is satisfied that injury is being caused to the board, may make such order as he may think fit, either by way of ordering the producer to comply, or by injunction restraining the jjTo6.v.oeT from continuing to sell the commodity in any way contrary to the terms of the scheme. Provided that the Minister shall not approve any scheme unless and until he has been informed that the President of the Board of Trade is satisfied that the scheme contains adequate safe-guards for the protection of the consumer against unfair prices, I appreciate the importance of safeguarding the interests of consumers and I think that this will be sufficiently secured by the immediately foregoing provision .     There are also the further safeguards that the Bill will contain, as explained in the first paragraph on page 3 of the Explanatory Memorandum, provision for revocation of a scheme by the Minister on a resolution of Parliament, and the fact that imports are uncontrolled in any way which,  in itself, will provide an effective check.(b) Revolving Loan Fund.    By providing a revolving fund of, say,  500,000 which (on the lines of the F.S.A, Agricultural Marketing Act, 1929) will be placed at the disposal of the Minister for the purpose of making short-term loans to statutory boards as a contribution towards initial working capital and for making long-term loans either to Statutory boards or to Agricultural Co-operative Societies engage cl in marketing agricultural produce, to facilitate the acquisition of premises, plant and equipment.    The rules or articles of association of the statutory boards should incorporate such do-operative principles as the Minister may impose in order to ensure bona-fide co-operative practice, and the loans
SSrd. January, 1930.loans should be made on the advice of an Advisory Committee on the lines of the Committees set up under the Trade Facilities Act and, more recently, the Colonial Development Act..jjAn explanation of the above proposals is given in some detail in the accompanying memorandum.I have agreed with the Secretary of State for Scotland that the Bill shall be a joint measure but that there shall be a separate quota for Scotland and that it shall be administered in Scotland by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland.     The explanatory memorandum should be read in that light,I should explain that the first part of the Bill relating to the creation of Statutory Marketing Boards follows the lines of recent legislation in certain of the Dominions siioh as South Africa, Eew South Wales, Queensland and British Coltimbia.It is true that compulsory combination is an innovation in agriculture in this country, but I think that following on the failure of English Hop Growers&apos;, Limited,  of the Milk Levy plan put forward last summer, and in the face of the disastrous situation in the potato market, farming opinion in Great Britain is tendingtowards the idea of compulsion, at the request of the industry, for recalcitrant minorities where the majority have agreed to some form, df collective action.I hope that the Cabinet will authorise the immediate preparation of a Bill on these lines.istry of Agriculture and. Fisheries.
1.PROPOSED AGRICULTURAL MARKETING BILL. 1EXPLANATORY    MEMORANDUM.( i) Statutory Boards .These may be large-scale co-operative trading organisations formed to undertake the actual purchase and/or sale of a commodity and/or operations incidental thereto or they may be large-scale organisations that are formed mainly to undertake certain marketing or allied functions such, for example, as financial)storage)or other operations or the collection of a levy (and the administration of the resulting fund) for the purpose of dealing with surpluses.     The idea of large-scale trading organisations is not foreign to farming opinion in this country.      There has recently been one such organisation in existence - English Hop Growers Ltd. - the history of which might have been very different had it had the support of legislation of the kind now adumbrated.     Similarly, the idea of non-trading stabilising corporations is not unfamiliar.     A proposal to form a stabilisation board to deal with surpluses was, in effect, brought forward by the National Farmers1 Union last year in regard to milk:*   in the Ministry&apos;s Report on Potato Marketing (Economic Series No.9), a proposal on somewhat similar lines is made in regard to potatoes.The probability that large-scale producer-controlled marketing organisations will be a feature of agricultural market-ing in this country in future, justifies&quot; and necessitates a Bill such as that now proposed in order to standardise the constitution and functions of such bodies so that when they are broughts   See also, for example, Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Act, 1929 - British Columbia.
-   12.into existence by producers they shall be part of a coherent plan.     It is believed that the Bill would prove helpful to the National Farmers&apos; Union In enabling it not only to promote, more sucessfully, another hop combine and to bring useful stabilising sohemes into operation for dealing with milk and potatoes, but to keep a directing hand on marketing developments generally.     The representative character of the Union, the wide experience of its leaders, the efficiency of its organisation and the loyalty of its members are such that it is unlikely that the adherence of a substantial majority of producers to any marketing plan would be obtained without the Union&apos;s concurrence and support.It is contemplated that schemes may be either local or national.     The admission of local or &quot;district&quot; sohemes is desirable, not only because the production of many commodities is localised kui because a successful district scheme would probably lead- up&apos;to a national a scheme in cases where production is diffused over a wide area. It would, however, be necessary so to define &quot;district&quot; in the proposed Bill as to exclude trivial applications from bodies or groups of mere parochial significance and to oonfine it to local outputs of commercial importance, It would also be desirable to provide that the Minister&apos;s approval of &quot;district&quot; schemes should be given after consultation with such national organisations of producers as the Minister may hold to be concerned.
3*The Bill should provide for the publication of overy approved scheme in the London Gazette and should give the Minister power, on a resolution of Parliament, to revoke any scheme that is being administered in a manner contrary to the interests of the community or to the policy of the Bill or of the scheme or the terms thereof as approved. It may also be necessary to safe-guard the position of producers who may be unable to comply with a trading scheme by reason of existing obligations, whether contractual or arising out of indebtedness.Open poyts constitute a standing safeguard for the consumer and there is also the power of revocation, but the Bill should also provide that the Minister shall not approve any scheme until theBresjdent of the Board of Trade is satisfied that it will not expose the consumer to unfair prices.It should be provided in the interpretations of the Bill (i)  that the word &quot;supply&quot; (regulate the supply and salo) may include &quot;production&quot;, because some schemes (e.g. hops) may provide for regulation of output, and (ii)  &quot;sale&quot; may include &quot;preparation for sale&quot;.       Definitions may also be necessary for &quot;producer&quot;&apos; and &quot;commodity&quot; - in the latter case, not only to define the range of agricultural produce, raw or manufactured,- but to provide that schemes may deal with one or more related commodities (e.g.  eggs and poultry or wheat, barley and oats) .As the Bill   would create no hew criminal offences, but provide that redress against non-complying producers shall be obtained by oivil process, it is necessary, apart from any question of limitation of liability, for the Bill to provide that the national or district boards shall be incorporated, in order that they may be capable of suing or of being sued.
4.There   is no outstanding advantage, save in relief from Schedules C and D of the Income Tax Acts, in incorporation under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, inasmuch as it is possible to include co-operative principles in the articles of association of a Company incorporated under the Companies Acts,Power should, however, be sought for the Minister in the Bill to require that the rules or articles of association of the statutory boards shall include such, co-operative safe-guards as the Minister may impose.      The safeguards .vhich might be desirable in this case are:-1,   Limitation of interest orf share capital (to, say, 6 per cent,) - this will bo in line with the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts (Amendment)  Bill, now before Parliament,2,    No member, or shareholder, other than a registeredsociety,  to have more than one vote.      This is also In line with the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts (Amendment) Bill but a night need further consideration in regard to the position of corporations registered under the Companies Acts and being the equivalent of registered societies.        The matters    that may be decided by vote may have to be prescribed in the .BI11,3,    Balance of profits, after provision is made forreserves,  etc,,  to be distributed in/the form of bonus on business. This is known as the patronage dividend.It may also be desirable to specify what provision for reserves shall be made.
It may be desirable actually to specify these safeguards in the proposed Bill.(ii) Revolving Fund.It is suggested that the Bill should make provision for a revolving fund of  500,000 or such larger sum as Parliament may from time to time provide.    The corresponding fund provided in the U.S.A. Marketing Act, 1920, is fixed at 500 million dollars, which has been made immediately available.The idea of a revolving fund - and this may need to be defined in the Bill - is that the fund shall be an entity, that all payments by borrowers in respect ox capital and interest shall revert to the fund in order to maintain it as a credit reservoir the contents of which are in continual circulation.It is proposed to provide in the Bill for the appointment of an Agricultural Marketing Facilities Committee, on whose recommendation or, alternatively, in consultation with whom, the Minister may make advancea from the revolving fund to statutory boards under conditions referred to later (See Colonial Development Act, 1929, and Trade Facilities Act, 1921). Purpose of Short-term Loans.     The functions of the national or district board may be simple (requiring- little capital) or multiple, involving trading risks, capital and running costs on aocount of storage, processing, etc.,    or advances on account of produce, dhort-term loans made under the proposed Bill would have only one purpose, namely, to provide statutory boards with temporary funds in anticipation of subscriptions and receipts from other sources, La., sharee, loans and / or membership fees in the first instance and, later, seasonal bank credit and deductions from proceeds of sales.    They are not intended permanently to finance any of the operations referred to above.    If such were the intention, a very large sum of money would be needed.    In the U.S.A. Agricultural Marketing Act,.provision is made for loans to co-operative
associations for the following purposes:-1.   Merchandising (including: insurance against merchanting risks).2.    The construction, hire or purchase of buildings and plant for storage, processing, etc.3.    The formation of clearing-house associations.4.   Propaganda.5.   Advances on account of members1 produce delivered to the association.For the purpose of these loans, Congress, as stated,&apos; has provided a revolving fund of  100 million.    In our case, it will not be necessary to restrict a statutory board in the use it may make of a loan;    provided that the purpose of the board is clearly defined in its rules or in its articles of association or in the approved scheme, any use of the loan to which the Minister would be likely to take exception would itself be ultra vires, i.e. any expenditure which it is competent to a board to incur can be regarded as a proper subject for a loan under the Bill.The heads under which a loan would most probably be used are:-a. Preliminary propaganda and publicity.b. Salaries, office expenses, travelling, etc.c. Market intelligence.d. All preliminary expenses.e. Initial payments on account of :-(i) physical facilities for marketing, storage, processing etc.,(ii) advances on produce delivered.The short-term loans contemplated by the Bill would, therefore, be intended to assist in the initial establishment of a new board, so as to enable it to go right ahead with its plans before its capital and revenue expectations have been actually ealised.
Conditions of Short-term Loans.    It is suggested that the Bill should provide that loans should be subject to the following conditions:-a. no loan shall be made for a longer period than two years,b. a loan shall be renewable, either as to the whole or part, subject to a fresh recommendation of (? consultation with) the Agricultural Marketing Facilities Committee, and any such recommendation shall state that the Committee Is satisfied and shall show:-(I)    that the renewal is justified by additional services being or about to be undertaken by the board,(II)    that the renexval is not necessitated by the inability of the board to repay the loan for any other reason than in (i),(ill)   that adequate arrangements have been or will be made to liquidate the loan within the period specified by the Committee in its recommendation,So    a loan shall be free of interest for such period as maybe approved by the Minister after which period interest at 1 per cent, above Bank rate will be charged,d.    a loan shall be secured and redeemed in accordance withsuoh requirements as the Minister may make with thoapproval of the Treasury.These conditions have boen designed bearing in mind thepurpose of these loans, as explained aboveThus,in Condition (a), a loan Is limited to 2 years,this being considered the maximum period which a board might require in which to consolidate its financial arrangementsbCondition (b)  is intended to introduce a buffer between an indigent board and the Minister.    It is not intended thatpoverty, through the failure of business or financial pirns,shall be a justification for a renewal  (on this point seeCondition (c)).    An application for a renewal is, therefore,required to be supported by a fresh recommendation by theAgricultural Marketing Facilities Committee which should beftade only on the merits of the application, in such circumstances as, for example, an extension of the board&apos;s activities or of its
9.statutory areas of operations, such as would produce a similar set of conditions as in the case of an original application.Condition (c) is designed to make a loan the more useful to a board, within the limits of its purpose as a temporary source of funds, and to remove any incentive to a board to delay repayment. It might be desirable to include a minimum rate of interest equal to the maximum rate payable on shares, other sources of capital, or other borrowings.In regard to condition (d) tho following considerations are relevant:-(i).    It will be open to the organisers of a scheme to prepare its marketing plans in anticipation of becoming a statutory board but it will not be competent for them to raise money (except voluntarily) until the scheme has the sanction of the Minister.(ii).   The fixed assets of a board will frequently be negligible although they may be considerable.    In the first oase, there will be none available as security and in the seoond case they would be unsuitable as security for short-term credit and would probably be needed as security for long-term credit.(iii).    On the above assumption, there will be no tangible security for a short-term loan.    On the other hand, the compulsory nature of a scheme may offer a better security for public funds than fixed assets by assuring the board of an ascertainable turnover, from the deductions on which the loan would be repaid.(iv).    It may be desirable to provide in the Bill that, short-term loans made thereunder shall take procedure&amp;ace over share capital, member ship- fees, certificates of indebtedness and, possibly, other classes of creditors (c.f. Agricultural Credits Act.)  &apos;
e. *     187(v)     As a short ternrloan-made--under-the-Bill is not intended to be a part of the permanent capitalisation of a board, but only to be an advance in anticipation of it, there can be no hardship in requiring that all credits  (or such proportion as may be required) accruing to a board by way of deductions from returns to producers, up to the extent of a loan, shall be paid to a loan redemption account in the name of the Treasury or in whomsoever the fund is vested. Long-term loans.      It is proposed that advantage should be taken of the opportunity provided by the Bill to include within Its scope and thus give permanence to the I inistry of Agriculture existing scheme for making long-term loans, secured on fixed assets, to agricultural co-operative societies engaged in marketing agricultmral produce.      It is proposed that the Bill should make available for these long-term loans, out of the revolving fund, the sum of  100,000 or such larger sum as shall not exceed at any time 3-/5th of the monies which Parliament may have provided for the fund.     This maximum is suggested in order to ensure that an excessive part of the fund is not permanently tied up in long-term advances.It will be necessary or desirable to amend the existing loan scheme,a. so as to admit within the scheme any statutory board which may be incorporated under the Companies Acts, subject to the Inclusion of co-operative safeguards in its articles of association,b. so as to admit, on similar principles, an agricultural marketing company (not being a statutory board) rhich has incorporated the same co-operative safeguards in Its articles of association,c. so as to increase, in the case of a statutory board,the maximum loan permissible;    the present maximum of 10,000 would be Insufficient.OF AGRICULTURE &amp; FISHERIES.
