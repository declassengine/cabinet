ftj^jwniMENT 15 THE IROEBRTT OF HIS BRITAN17IC JA33STY&apos;S GOV^tSTMBlTT).21(30)0 A B I N E T.Memorandum bjjr the Lord Privy Seal,.1, My colleagues will no doubt have seen some of thePress reports ef the speech I made at Manchester a few days ago, in the course of which, after describing our general unemployment policy,  I made a pronouncement as to the readiness of the City to consider sympathetically proposals that may be put forward for assisting the re-organisation of industry on sound lines.    For the purposes of record I attach a copy of my statement.    The statement has been given considerable publicity, and, while there appears to be a feeling of gloom more pronounced than is usual at this time of the year,  the announcement of the readiness of finance to co-operate with industry has-arousod interest and hope over wide areas.2. Naturally I shall be questioned as to the actionI am taking to follow up the pronouncement.   Like most, if not all, sound schemes to aid the revival of industry, this plan cannot lead to spectacular or immediate results. Rationalisation and re-organisation are laborious processes, requiring much Investigation and consultation with many interests,  and they are not processes that can wisely be hurried.    I have been promised the aid of a small group of prominent industrialists, who are prepared to advise me, and I Intend to use their services both In regard to the general question and in relation to particular trades. I am in close touch with the Governor of the Bajak of England, who is most willingly giving his time and attention to this business, and I am meeting a group of other City interests,i.e.,/
i.e,,  the Issuing Houses,  this week in order to explain to them the lines upon which I am proceeding, in the hope that opportunities which may he put forward for assisting the re-organisation of industry on right lines may he received sympathetically.    The Joint Stock Banks are,  of course, an important factor and I am considering in what way they can best be induced to co-operate.3. I have had some personal discussion with the TradesUnion Council,  and hope to arrange to meet the new joint body (the Trade Union Congress General Council,  the Hationa.1 Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations, and the Federation of British Industries)  set up as a result of the Melchett-Turner discussions,  so that they will be able to enter upon their joint discussion of questions that may effect unemployment armed with firsthand knowledge of the situation as I see it and with full cognisance of my plans.4. These consultations- and discussions,  together withthe steps I have been taking to see representatives of the various industries, represent a determination to put before the leaders of industry both an offer of help and a measure of optimism designed to encourage them to continue their efforts to reduce costs of production and so to expand trade.    This is all.the more necessary by reason of the fact that as and when plans for rationalising certain industries become effective, they will lead to a displacement of workpeople who will swell the unemployment figures,  until,  at a later stage,  the general expansion of industry gives them some other opportunities of year without any improvement in the unemployment figures, especially in view of the terms of the present Unemployment Insurance Bill,  but this should not deter us from encouraginghealthy/
healthy reconstruction however drastic. 5. We must,. I think, recognise that the trend ofemployment at the moment is unfavourahle;    the recovery from the rise in the unemployment figures at Christmas is slower than vsaal, and there are no very clear indications of any definite improvement.    (The schemes that we have assisted are beginning to come into operation and we shall soon get some benefit from that;    the need to prepare plans etc., however,  inevitably means delay.)   Pears are expressed as to the effect of the Coal Bill upon costs of production, and the situation in India and China has worsened the position in Lancashire;    but the advice I get from many quarters is that thefbver-riding  cause of the rather sombre outlook is the fear that the Budget must be an unfavourable one, having regard to our commitments, both inherited and assumed.    Until the uncertainty has been removed and the worst - or best -known, recovery seems bound to be delayed.(Tntd.)    J. H. T.Treasury Chambers. 20th January, 1930.
THE CITY AND INDUSTRY.(EXTRACT FROM SPEECH BY LORD PRIVY SEAL, I:A1TCRBSTER, 10th JAITUARY,   1930.)In considering the steps that night he taken to produce a better employment position by improving the organisation and equipment of British industries I have found that a feeling exists that manufacturers are handi-capped in bringing about the necessary re-organisation and re-equipment by the fact that the long-continued trade depression has pushed them to the limits of the credit which they can reasonably expect to obtain from their bankers or which the bankers can reasonably be expected to provide.As a result of consultations I have had,  I am now in a position to state that the City is deeply interested in placing- industry upon a broad and sound basis and ready to support any plans that in its opinion lead to this end. Those in the City who have been studying this matter are convinced that a number of our important industries must be fundamentally re-organised and modernised,  in order to be able to produce at prices which will enable them to compete with the world.Industries which propose schemes that, in the opinion of those advising the City,   conform to this requirement will receive the most sympathetic consideration and the co-operation of the City in working out plans and finding the necessary finance.In the case of individual undertakings,  the City will be similarly ready to help,  provided that the scheme under discussion fits in as part of the genera.1 pla,na for the industry in question as a whole and gives reasonable promise that the changes will enable the undertaking to become an effective unit in combination and co-operation with other similar undertakings.
