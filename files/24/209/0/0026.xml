REPORT.The Origin of the Enquiry.1. THE Cabinet at a meeting held on the 27th November, 1929 (Cabinet 50 (29), Conclusion 11), agreed that the strength of the British infantry garrison in China should be reduced by one battalion in February 1930.2. Early in December, however, there was an outbreak of revolts in the Chinese National armies, and a rapid Spread of civil war conditions in China; arid the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to the gravity of the situation at the Cabinet Meeting held on the 11th December, 1929 (Cabinet 52 (29), Conclusion 1). In the course of the discussion that followed, the Secretary of State for War expressed the viewthat the policy of the Government in regard to trouble in China was hot&apos;sufficiently clear; and the Cabinet agreed : &quot; (a.) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers at the head of the three Service Departments should continue their review of the situation in China in regard to (i) the immediate situation;(ii) the general policy as regards the distribution of troops.(b.) That the Committee of Chiefs of Staff should advise the above Ministers on both aspects of the question.&quot;The Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.3. The Report submitted by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in pursuance of the above instructions is annexed.  We met to consider it on the 17th January.The Immediate Situation.4. In regard to the situation, as it existed on the 20th December, 1929, the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee is summarised as follows : &quot; We consider that, according to the latest information, the immediate situation is less anxious than it was on the 11th December, when the matter was referred to us, and calls for no special military disposition.&quot;5. The situation, though of course still uncertain, has in. no wise deteriorated since the date on which the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee reported. Accordingly, we see no reason to recommend either a reversal of the decision of the Cabinet (CP. 50 (29), Conclusion 11) that a British infantry battalion should be withdrawn in February 1930, or the adoption of any special military dispositions to meet the immediate situation.The General Policy as regards the Distribution of Troops.6. The policy that has hitherto been pursued as regards the distribution and employment of our armed forces in China is laid down in the telegram of the 4th August from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Sir Miles Lampson, the terms of which were approved by the Cabinet of the day (Cabinet 48 (27), Conclusion 3). This telegram is reproduced as Appendix D to the Annexure to this Report.7.   Summarily stated, the policy has, been this :  (a.) Dissemination of our forces is to be avoided; and(&amp;.) Although the use of force for other purposes is not absolutely excluded, the dominating consideration is to be the protection of life.8. The effect of this policy has been to concentrate our forces for the purpose of ensuring (a) that the Colony of Hong Kong is adequately protected; (&amp;) that the garrison at Shanghai, assisted by our own naval forces and the Shanghai Volunteers, should be adequate to deal with mob violence; and (c) that our Legation in Peking and its communications with the sea should be guarded in co-operation with the other &quot;Protocol&quot; troops.[20492] b 2
9. It goes without saying that particular circumstances may arise from time to time which may necessitate a reconsideration of, and possibly a departure from, the policy summarised in the preceding paragraphs. But we-consider that it is sound in principle; and we recommend that it should be reaffirmed by the Cabinet.Summary of Conclusions. 10.   We summarise our conclusions as follows :  (a.) We consider that the decision of the Cabinet to withdraw a British infantry battalion in February 1930 (Cabinet 50 (29), Conclusion 11) should stand.(&amp;.) We recommend that the Cabinet should reaffirm the general policy that has hitherto been pursued of avoiding dispersion of the British military forces in China and of concentrating for the purpose of ensuring (i) that the Colony of Hong Kong is adequately protected; (ii) that the garrison in Shanghai, assisted by our own naval forces and the Shanghai Volunteers, should be adequate to deal with mob violence; and (iii) that our Legation in Peking and its communications with the sea should be guarded in co-operation with the other &quot; Protocol &quot; troops.(c.) We recommend that the Cabinet should reaffirm the policy as regards the employment of military forces which is laid down in the Foreign Office telegram of the 4th -August, 1929 (sej3 Appendix D to Annexure), namely, that, although the use of force for other purposes is not absolutely excluded, the dominating consideration is to be the protection of life.(Signed) ARTHUR HENDERSON (Chairman).T. SHAW. THOMSON. A. V. ALEXANDER.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, January 22, 1930.
ANNEXURE.[CCS. 215.][CI.D. Paper No. 974-B.]CHINA.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.ON the 11th December, 1929, the Cabinet agreed (Cabinet 52 (29), Conclusion 1) :-&quot; (a.) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers at the head of the three Service Departments should continue their review of the situation in China in regard to : (i) the immediate situation;(ii) the general policy as regards the distribution of troops.(&amp;.) That the Committee of Chiefs of Staff should advise the above Ministers on both aspects of the question.&quot;2.   On the 16th December, 1929, we met to consider the above questions.The Immediate Situation.3. As regards the first question, a summary of the situation, as it existed on the 13th December, 1929, is appended to this Report (Appendix A). According to telegrams subsequently received, the various bodies of troops in Central China, which revolted against the Nanking Government last week, have made no headway, while the forces attacking Canton have been defeated. The position of that Government must, therefore, be considered to have become more secure for the present. Consequently, the immediate situation is less anxious, and calls for no special dispositions on our part.The Distribution of Troops.4. Turning now to the larger question of the distribution of troops, the military problem in China is largely dependent on the degree of protection which is to be afforded to the scattered British communities in that country. The total British population in China is in the region of 15,000. From these there are very small communities in a large number of places, as well as missionaries who are scattered throughout the interior at their own risk. The table attached as Appendix &quot; B &quot; gives the principal places which contain British communities in China, and the approximate number of British subjects at each place; and a note on the Foreign Forces in China is attached as Appendix C.5. Although frequent suggestions have been made from time to time for the despatch of troops to different localities in China, and although, on one occasion, the British Minister in Peking suggested that &quot; Troops may be required here, there and every where, &quot;* the general policy which we have advocated in the past, and which has hitherto been approved by the Government of the day, is to avoid the dispersal of our military forces, or the acceptance of fresh military commitments. For example, in our appreciation of the situation, dated the 29th March, 1927 (C.I.D. Paper No. 784-B), we commented on a proposal that authority should be given for the occupation of the Bogue forts (Canton) as follows :&quot; Paragraph 16 . . . We are opposed at this juncture to any action which would involve an additional commitmient of unknown scope in China involving the land forces.&quot;* Peking telegram to Foreign Office No. 1085 of the 5th April, 1927.
6. A few days later, on the 8th April, 1927, we quoted the same principle to oppose the detachment of military units for the defence of the Concession at Amoy and of our interests at Swatow (Paper No. 788-B, paragraph 9); and we pointed out that, &quot; whereas a warship can at any time withdraw from a locality where it is temporarily posted without any loss&quot; of prestige being involved, this is not the case when troops specifically allotted for protective purposes have to be withdrawn.&quot;We could quote other instances in which the same principle has been invoked.7. In certain isolated cases, we have, it is true, recommended the temporary employment of military forces to supplement naval landing parties.&quot; For example, on the 19th April, 1927, we recommended (C.I.D. Paper No. 793-B, paragraph 8) &quot;that the Naval Commander-in-Chief should be authorised to draw from the Shanghai Defence Force such forces as he may require and as the General Officer Commanding can spare, for such operations as raids by landing parties to destroy Chinese forts.&quot; But we were careful to explain (C.I.D. Paper 794-B, paragraph 4) that troops should be employed on services of this character only provided that they could be spared from their primary duties at the main centres in China; and, further, we emphasised that their &apos; detabhment &apos;should be essentially&apos; temporary, and that &quot;they should immediately be re-embarked and returned to Shanghai as soon as their services could be dispensed with.For some months, also, a company of infantry was stationed at Nanking, though the difficulty experienced in withdrawing it illustrates the objections to such detachments.8. Broadly speaking, therefore, it may be said that, apart from the few exceptions mentioned above, the policy up to now in regard to the distribution of forces has been to concentrate for the purpose of ensuring (i) that the Colony of Hong Kong is adequately protected, (ii) that the garrison in Shanghai, assisted by our own naval forces and the Shanghai Volunteers, should be adequate to deal with mob violence, and (iii) that our Legation in Peking and its communications with the sea should be guarded in co-operation with the other &quot; Protocol &quot; troops. As far as possible any other military commitments have been avoided.9. As regards the utilisation of the Forces, the policy up to now has been that set forth in the telegram of the 4th August, 1927 (Appendix D) from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Sir Miles Lampson, the terms of which were appro\red by the Cabinet on the same day (Cabinet 48 (27), Conclusion 3). From this it will be noted that, although the use of force for other purposes is not absolutely excluded, the dominating consideration is the protection of life.10. Turning from the past to the present, the following regular military forces, speaking in terms of infantry battalions, are at present located in China :-Tientsin        ... ...      2 British battalions (detachment at Peking).Shanghai       ... ...      2 British battalions.. Hong Kong   ... ...      2 British battalions, 1 Indian battalion.11. One British battalion is to be withdrawn from Hong Kong on the 25th February, 1930, thus reducing the infantry garrisons in China to 6 battalions (1 Indian), and the Cabinet has decided not to replace it. This is the number of battalions recommended in the last Annual Review of Imperial Defence Policy (C.I.D. Paper No. 948-B) as the absolute minimum for our infantry garrison of China. It will be seen that up to the 25th February next there will be 7 battalions in China.Of this force, provided the situation in the north and south permit, and provided that the situation at Hong Kong does not preclude the strength of the garrison being temporarily reduced below 2 battalions, 3 battalions-2 from Hong Kong and 1 from Tientsin can be made available, without denuding either of these places, to reinforce the 2 battalions at Shanghai or to proceed elsewhere in China. After the 25th February, when the garrison is reduced to 6 battalions, 2 only will be available as reinforcements in similar circumstances.1.2, The recrudescence of civil war has, however, again focussed attention on the isolated British communities up the Yangtse and in other localities in China; and it is not improbable that demands may .be made in the near future on the Army to provide detachments to safeguard the lives and property of our fellow-nationals in some, at least, of these places.
*13. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has grave misgivings on this account. &quot; The smallest detached unit, ;&apos;T he .says, &quot;which can usefully and safely be employed on protective duties is one company, and our experience of the Nanking detachment, which, after continual representations by the General Staff, was eventually withdrawn after a period of ten months, shows that, once a small military force is installed as a protective measure, every possible political argument will be used to prevent its withdrawal. Should we accept the policy of providing protection at even a limited number of the smaller ports, we should be faced with a series of similar protracted occupations, which will involve the retention in China of a larger number of troops than I have, up to date, considered to be necessary. What this extra number would amount to I cannot well say until I am informed of the places which will require protection.&quot;14. The Chief of the Naval Staff, on the other hand, points out that the larger proportion of the trade of the Yangtse is in British hands, and that if that trade is to continue, it must be protected. In that connection he told us that the Chinese Minister in London had recently expressed the hope, and the belief, that Chiang Kai Shek would win through. But if he fought and it was anticipated that he would fight- and is beaten, conditions on the Yangtse would be chaotic forvsix months or more. The Naval Commanders on the spot have the widest discretionary powers in the matter of affording protection to British lives and property wherever situated; and the Chief of the Naval Staff is apprehensive lest the acceptance of the policy, that the military forces should not be employed for any other purposes except those indicated in paragraph 8, should put upon the Navy responsibilities which, with its present strength in these waters, it would be unable to fulfil. It is to be noted in this connection that for the past three winters the Admiralty have had to immobilise a cruiser for at least four months in the year for the protection of Hankow. - In such a position, the cruiser is carrying out the duties rightly belonging, in the opinion of the Admiralty, to land forces, and it is contrary to their general policy. The Commander-in-Chief in China has already asked that his Cruiser squadron should be maintained at full numbers at all times, including periods of enforced absence through refits and recommissioning of ships, by reinforcement from the Mediterranean Station, and this may be necessary.15.   To sum up : (a.) We consider that, according to the latest information, the immediate situation is less anxious than it was on the 11th December, when the matter was referred to us, and calls for no special military dispositions.(b.) The larger question of the strength and distribution of the British military forces in China, depends upon the degree of protection which is to be afforded to the scattered communities in that country; and we ask the Cabinet to decide the question of policy, whether they intend (i) to adhere to the policy hitherto pursued of avoiding dispersion of the British military forces and Of concentrating them at the main centres specified in paragraph 8, as well as to the policy as regards the utilisation of those forces which is set forth in Appendix D; or, alternatively, (ii) to employ military forces, either alone or in conjunction with naval forces, for the protection of British lives and property at other places in addition to those specified in paragraph 8.H. TRENCHARD. CHARLES E. MADDEN. G. F. MILNE.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, December 20, 1929.
APPENDIX A.Summary of the Situation in China, December 13, 1929. (Prepared under the direction of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.)1- During the opening days of December the interested foreign Powers were much exercised over the possible eventualities of the announcement by the National Government that they proposed unilaterally to abolish extra-territoriality on the 1st January, 1930. The outbreak of revolts in the National armies against the present Chinese Government leaders,.and the rapid spread of civil war conditions, has, in the past few days, overshadowed the extra-territorial question.2.   Briefly, the present situation is as follows:-(a.) On the Honan Front.Some indeterminate fighting has taken place on the Lunghai Railway in the Chengchow-Tungkwan area, between National Government forces and Feng&apos;s adherents.   At the moment a state of truce prevails.(b.) In the Hankow Area.Most of the National Government troops have been evacuated from Hankow, which is now held by about 40,000 men. A rebel force under Tang Sheng-chih is threatening Hankow from the north, along the Peking-Hankow Railway, whilst another rebel force from Feng&apos;s armies is reported to be advancing south-east down the Han River on Hankow.(c.) On the Pukow-Tientsin Railway.A force of 40,000 National Government troops, who, in the last few days, have revolted against the present Government, are in occupation of the Pukow-Tientsin Railway from Suchowfu to Pengpu (80 miles north of Pukow), and of the Lunghai Railway for a distance of 90 miles west of Suchowfu.(d.) The Nanking-Shanghai Area.Chiang Kai-shek has been concentrating his forces for the defence of Nanking and Shanghai. He now has some 60,000 troops in this area. Some of these are of doubtful loyalty. Certain troops that were sent to reinforce Canton have since been recalled to Nanking.     .  ;Martial law has been declared in Nanking and Shanghai.(e.) In Kwangtung.Canton is threatened by attacks from the west, north-west and north. On the west a force of Kwangsi rebels is attacking along the West River. On the north-west and north, a rebel force, under Chang Pat-kwei, of some 10,000 &quot;Ironsides,&quot; is believed to be within 25 miles of the City. There is much nervousness, and many Chinese have evacuated their families to Hong Kong.Summary.3. The Nanking Government is thus faced with a most serious crisis, which may well bring about its downfall. The Government is credited with the intention of straining every nerve to hold Nanking, if necessary falling back fighting on Shanghai, the greatest financial prize in the eyes of every Chinese war-lord or politician. It is possible, therefore, that fighting on a serious scale may take place in and around Shanghai.A point in favour of the present regime at Nanking is that there does not appear to be any cohesion between the three hostile elements, i.e., Feng&apos;s forces in Honan, the revolted troops on the Pukow-Tientsin Railway, and those attacking Canton.
For the present the troops who have revolted have not turned against.their own officers, and are not, therefore, as yet, bandits.An annexure showing the approximate strength of the foreign forces in China and their probable action is attached.Conclusion.4.   There are thus two dangers to which British Nationals may be exposed : (a.) Molestation by the mutinous soldiers of the various factions in the civil war areas.The troops who have revolted have not turned against their own officers yet, but the transition stage from the present state to avowed banditry is usually speedy. This danger is the more imminent, and is particularly likely to occur in the Yangtse ports. (&amp;.) A wave of anti-foreign fanaticism, should the present Nanking Govern-menfs, or its successor^, denunciation of extra-territoriality be followed by minor incidents caused by agents of the Government attempting domiciliary visits, arrest, illegal imposition of taxes, &amp;c, in implementing the denunciation.M.I. 2, December 13, 1929.APPENDIX B.Pbtncipal Places containing British Communities in China.Place.Shanghai HankowNankingAnsoy..ChefooNingpoChinkiang Kiukiang Anking SwatowFoochowShameen (Canton)IchangChungkingChangshaTientsinPekingApproximate number of British Subjects.Remarks.9,300 (including Indians)200Under  50,, 250 ,, 250 ,,    100ioo,,    100 50,, 250 ,,    250700 (Europeans)Under 100,,    5,0ioo680 300Contains over 50 per cent, of the British population.

APPENDIX C.Foreign Forces in China.1. American.There are available in Shanghai about 1,100 American Marines, and in North China about 1,300 soldiers and marines. The American policy is to evacuate American citizens from places of danger to places where they can be adequately protected. It is known, however, that U.S. forces will only intervene to afford protection to U.S. citizens actually in danger. They will not intervene to uphold treaty rights, and will not co-operate in any International scheme for defending the International Settlement at Shanghai from outside aggression.Additional U.S. naval vessels have been despatched to Shanghai from Manila.2. French.About 3,600 French troops are available in China, of whom 1,200 are defending the French Concession at Shanghai; about 2,000 are in the Tientsin area. Full discretion as to the protection of French nationals rests with the French Minister to China. Reinforcements up to 3 Battalions from Tongking are available within 8 to 10 days if required.   The French may be relied on to defend their interests firmly.3. Japanese.About 800 Japanese troops are available in North China, and a landing party of about 1,300 sailors is available in Shanghai (500 of the latter are earmarked for Hankow if required). The Japanese will give no guarantee as to their probable action. It may:confidently be anticipated, however, that in the event of trouble the Japanese will take their full share in any schemes for the defence of either the International Settlement at Shanghai or of the Peking-Tientsin area.APPENDIX D.Cypher Telegram to Sir M. Lampson (No. 2), dated August 4, 1927.IN view of last paragraph of your telegram No. 1156 and some earlier telegrams I think that it may be of use to you that I should state the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the threat or use of force in China for the attainment of political ends as distinct from the protection of life.The decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to despatch the&apos; defence force to Shanghai was based solely on  he urgent need for the protection of that great community. The military advisers of His Majesty&apos;s Government were and are definitely opposed to a dissemination of such forces as are available, and His Majesty&apos;s Government were obliged to recognise that similar armed protection by troops could not be afforded at all points where British settlements existed or British interests were involved. For the protection of Peking and Tientsin they have always felt that the main reliance must be placed on Powers which took a lesser part in the defence of Shanghai, whilst special instructions were issued dealing with possible eventualities at Canton. It may be necessary from time to time to revise these instructions or to consider afresh particular cases, but in all cases hitherto the protection of life has been the primary and dominating consideration in the mind of His Majesty&apos;s Government,China is in a state of anarchy produced by revolution and civil wars. Such periods of anarchy have been a recurrent feature of Chinese history and they last long. If, therefore, force be used, it is difficult to set any limit to its employment either in time or space; and even if momentarily successful, it may amongst a people with so long a memory leave behind it a resentment which makes future friendly relations still more difficult,... His Majesty&apos;?. Government dp not absolutely exclude from consideration the use of force for other purposes, but Lfcey hold that
such use of force, and, therefore, any threat of its use, can be justified only by the most urgent necessity or the most conclusive advantages. They sympathise with your contention that in China the only practicable policy is one of firmness and justice. Such a policy implies, however, that where force is threatened it must be more than a mere threat and must proceed from a settled resolve to take active measures of coercion if the threat of them is not sufficient.His Majesty&apos;s Government could only contemplate the use of coercive measures if the following essential conditions were fulfilled : 1. The end in view must be indisputably attainable by the measures proposed, and the execution of these measures must lie within the military means available, i.e., such of His Majesty&apos;s military and naval forces as are at any time available for service in China.2. The force to be employed must be commensurate with the purpose which it is desired to achieve. This condition applies equally to the exertion demanded of His Majesty&apos;s forces and to&quot;the injury or loss inflicted on the Chinese.3. There must be reasonable assurance that the measures to be taken will prove effective, within a reasonable period, that they will not involve the lock-up of the forces for an indefinite time, and that they will not lead to further and unknown commitments.I should add that His Majesty&apos;s Government would require very strong arguments to induce them to embark on a policy based on coercive action without the active co-operation or at least the open support and approval of other interested Powers, notably Japan and the United States of America.The result of recent instances of proposed united coercive action have shown how little support His Majesty&apos;s Government could expect to receive from other interested Powers in the adoption, for any purpose other&quot; than that of protection of actual life, of such a line of action.It is true that your United States and Japanese colleagues have at times led you to believe that their Governments might be induced to accept their own views in regard to the practicability and efficacy of a show of force for political purposes in China. But your United States colleague has had frankly to avow that his Govern-ment do not accept his recommendations, and the Japanese Minister is clearly equally out of touch with the views held by the Government in Tokyo. It is therefore fairly clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not count on the support of either of these Governments, in whose countries any policy of an active or aggressive nature would be most unpopular. As member of the League of Nations, moreover, His Majestys Government must themselves take into careful consideration their own obligations and responsibilities to the League, as well as the general growing tendency in the rest of the world to condemn the exercise of methods of violence in international relationships.From the above it will appear that, however justifiable, and even sound, may be in principle a policy involving threat or use of force in China in certain circum-stances outside the elemental necessity of protecting British life there, it is becoming more and more clear that in practice such a policy must be discarded as a practicable and effective means of defending British treaty rights and established interests in that country, or of bringing the Chinese to see reason.Nothing in the above telegram is to be interpreted as modifying the instructions sent to the Commander-in-Chief on the 12th May and referred to in your telegram No. 921a of the 7th June.Please repeat to Peking.
