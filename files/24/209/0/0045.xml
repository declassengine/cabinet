(Former papers, CP. 275 (29) and 361 (29).)With reference to Cabinet decisions 42 (29), 43 (29) and 53 (29), I desire to have the decision of the Cabinet on the following point : Messrs. Vickers-Armstrongs, Ltd., wish to purchase 600 lb. of special fuze powder from War Department stocks in connection with an order for ammunition for the Turkish Government. This is not quite the same as purchasing surplus War Department stores, and it would be a severe handicap to the trade if firms could not purchase small quantities of special powders from War Department stocks from time to time.T. S.The War office,10th February, 1930.(B30/17)   60   2/30   w.o.P.   4861
