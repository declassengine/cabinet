THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.In-SECRET.                       i   CAB  I  N E T. CP .44 (24)                          PROPOSED PARLIAMENTARY BILLS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     I wish to circulate to my colleagues  the attachedNotes on certain Bills, some of which are  of considerableurgency, and at the same time are not of a particularlycontroversial character, with a view to a  decision being reached as to their Introduction into Parliament  afterthe end of the adjournment.     The Bills are classified in three categories,- havingregard to their degree of urgency and importance.    Themost pressing of them all is^-the one which stands  first inthe list, namely;- the War Charges (Validity^Bill, and Iwould suggest for the reasons given in the note appendedon the subject of that Bill that it should be introduced at the first possible occasion and proceeded with  as rapidly as can be managed.                           I.     (a)  far Charges (Validity) Bill.     (b)  Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill.     (c)  Merchant Shipping (Labour Conventions) Bill.     (d)  Sale of Bread Bill.     (e)  Arbitration Clauses in Commercial Agreements            (Protocol) Bill.                           II.     (f)  Bankruptcy and Companies Departments&apos; fees Bill.                           III.     (g)  Measuring Instruments Bill.     (h)  Coastguard Bill.     In addition to these Measures, I am interestedin the provisions as to the continuance of the Government
Export Credits Scheme which will find a place in theTrade Facilities Bill - a Measure for which the Treasurywill presumably be chiefly responsible.  This is most &apos;urgent in connection with unemployment.  There is also an Imperial Institute Bill which will, I understand, bebrought before the Cabinet by the Colonial Office.     The question of passing a government Merchandise MarksBill has been agitated for a number of years.  I do not see my way at present to recommend the Cabinet to sanction the Introduction of a Bill on this subject at the presenttime as the technical and largely non-controversial pro-posals would occupy much time anti any measure would be likelyto raise directly or indirectly highly controversial issues.The non-controversial proposals are not pressing.                       I.  -   URGENT.             (a) WAR CHARGES (VALIDITY) BILL.     This measure Is one for making valid certain charges and levies imposed by the Government during the late War,in order ,to prevent traders from making undue profits byreason of war conditions, and to provide for the control ofvarious commodities.  The legality of one kind of levy inconnection with.the control of milk was tested in the Courts,and the House of Lords decided judicially against the Crownin June, 1922;  this decision has been followed by the HighCourt in the case of a charge made in respeot of a licence to transfer a British ship to a foreign flag;  the result isto put in doubt the legality of all the other levies, and ifthey are not validated by a special measure, claims for repayment may be made aggregating  ,18,000,000, and  possiblymore.
     A statement was made In the House of Commons inMarch, 1922, by the Coalition Government that if the thenpending appeal to the House of Lords was given againstthe Crown, the Government would bring in a Bill to legalise their procedure in cases of this nature duringthe period of control.  In July, shortly after thejudicial decision of the Lords against the Crown, theonly debate on the matter which has taken place inParliament occurred when in the House of Lords a motion&quot;that the Government should reimburse all persons who&quot;have been compelled to pay the illegal tax of 2d. a gallon&quot;as a condition of a licence to sell, outside the south-west counties, milk produced In those counties&quot; was defeated.The then Government introduced at the beginning of Augusta Bill to legalise all the various charges in questionexcepting those for the milk levies.  The Bill made no progress, nor did it make any when introduced last year,owing In both cases to pressure of time.     Retrospective legislation is always open to objectionbut, on the other hand, there will probably be no generalsympathy for any traders who would have had aa advantage over their competitors if the charges had been remitted.Support from the members of the late Government could, Ishould think, be relied upon.  I accordingly suggest thatthis Bill should be proceeded with forthwith as it is most urgent to pass a Bill as expeditiously as possible.             (b)    CARRI/gD OF GOODS BY SEA BILL.     The Imperial Economic Conference passed a resolution in favour of Empire legislation to give statutory validity
                                                     .,     9 9 4to. certain Rules respecting Bills of Lading which hadalready been agreed to by all.parties concerned in thiscountry and have been approved by International Conferences.The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill, which proposes to givethe necessary validity to these Rules in this country had passed the House of Lords last session after amendment bya Select Committee of both Houses.   It would be desirable forthis country to take the lead In putting on its Statute Bookwithout delay the requisite legislation, and I have hadresolutions from a number of important commercial bodiesurging that the Bill should be made law at the earliestpossible date.   It should have an easy passage, and could,if desired, be introduced; as was the case last session, inthe Lords.     (c) MERCHANT SHIPPING (INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONVENTIONS)BILL.     This Bill proposes to give effect in this country to threeConventions adopted by the International Labour Organisation ofthe League of Nations in 1920. and 1921.   The Conventions weresigned by (among others) all the British representatives, i,e0,the representatives of the Government, the employers and the sea-men;  but they have not been ratified by this country pending  thepassing of legislation.  The Conventions provide for (1) the eom-pulsory payment of two months&apos; wages to unemployed shipwreckedseamen by the shipowners, (2) a minimum age for trimmers andstokers of British ships, and (3) the.medical examination ofpersons under 18 years of age employed on board ship.     The passing of this Bill, especially that part of It relat-ing to the Unemployment Indemnity, would give satisfaction to  the seamen, who have pressed for the passage of the necessary legis-lation, and at the same time iV would not be likely to raisemuch opposition from the owners.  I  suggest, therefore, that its early  introduction might be of advantagel                                                       (a)/
    &quot;  -           (a) SALE OF BREAD BILL.      For the last 100 years Bread, other  than fancy bread,  has  had to be sold by weight,  but,  until  the war,  loaves might be of  any weight.   In 1917  the Food Controller  made  an Order providing that no loaf  should be  sold unless its  weight were  1  lb.  or an even number of  pounds.   This provision is being kept in force by  the  Expiring  Laws Acts,  and  remains  until  December next.   Mr,  dynes,  when  Food Controller, gave  an assurance that careful consideration  would be  given to a proposal  for permanent legislation  on this  subject, and the Rathcreedan Inter-departmental  Committee recommended that  the  principle  of  a fixed  minimum weightfor a loaf  should be  embodied in an Aot of Parliament.     The Bill was introduced in 1922, but  the  scottish local Authorities wished to  extend it to various types of fancy bread, thereby  rendering it  contentious. It was  accordingly, not  further proceeded with.     I  am having  the natter  discussed again with the Scottish Office,  and hope to be able to put forward shortly a measure in  agreement with them,  for consideration.    (e) ARBITRATION CLAUSES  IN COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS               (PROTOCOL) BILL.     The Bill proposes to give effect in this country to a League of Nations Protocol, which has been signed onbehalf  of His Majesty&apos;s  Government, and those of France,Belgium, Italy, Greece,  Lithuania, Brazil,  Uruguay  andPanama.  The Protocol regains open for signature by other States.  It  cores into force after ratification by  two States,  and thereafter takes effect in the case of  each con tracting State one month, after the deposit of its ratification.  The  intention is that it should be ratified by His Majesty&apos;B Government after the passage of  the  Bill.          e
9 -) QM u ti     The Protocol provides that the contracting Statesshall recognise the validity of agreements hy which theparties to a contract agree to submit to arbitrationdifferences, existing or future, which may arise in connec-tion with the contract:  that they will ensure the enforce-ment of arbitral awards in their own territory:  and thatif cases are brought before the ordinary Courts in respectof contracts which provide for arbitration, the Courts  shallrefer the parties concerned to the decision of the Arbitrators,without prejudice, however, to the competence of the Courtsif the arbitration proceedings cannot proceed.     The Arbitration Act of 1889 which is in force inEngland and Wales, provides that arbitration awards on  aSubmission shall be enforced in the same manner as judgmentsor Orders of Court.   In regard to litigation brought for-ward in respect of a dispute the subject of arbitration, theAct leaves it to the discretion of..the judge or Court whether an Order shall be made staying the proceedings.  Under  the protocol, such an Order must be made.  Legislation isnecessary to give effect to this requirement, so far as con-cerns arbitration agreements to which the Protocol applies.It will receive support from the commercial community,  amongwhom the Protocol has been welcomed, and this is a furtherBill which might have an early introduction in the Lords.  r ^                II. - LESS URGENT.    g) BANKRUPTCY AND COMPANIES departments  FEES BILL.     Under the present law, fees received by the Board  ofTrade for Bankruptcy work have to be applied to meet ^theexpenses of Bankruptcy administration, and those obtained in Companies&apos; liquidation, to meet the expenses of Companiesadministration.
The Bankruptcy Fees and interest on balances are insufficient for the purpose notwithstanding that they have been raised toas high a figure as is considered expedient, whilst in thecase of Companies liquidation, there is a substantial profit.The Treasury desire to amalgamate the two classes of fees, sothat the loss on one administration can bo made up by a gainon the other; and to make it no longer necessary in fixing the amount of the feos, to take into consideration the interest on certain balances, the object being to raise the CompaniesLiquidation Fees to a level approximating that charged by outside liquidators.  I think this is not unreasonable, andthat a Bill should be introduced.                       III. NOT URGENT,               (g) MEASURING INSTRUMENTS BILL.     The object of this Bill is to remedy a defect in theexisting law, under which measuring instruments are free from any effective control.     Of these instruments tho most important at present arepetrol-measuring pumps, which deliver petrol direct to the tanksof motor cars.  Complaints of short measure from these instru-ments have been made by private individuals, and in the technicalpress.  On the other hand, the petrol-pump, with its undergroundstorage chamber, is much to be preferred, from the point of viewof public safety, to the two-gallon can, and is more convenientin every way, so that there is no doubt that it will comeextensively,into use in the future.     It will alBO be possible to deal, under the Bill, withmeasuring &quot;instruments used in factories for ascertaining wages,such as                                                   *     (1)   &quot;Wrap-reels&quot; used in textile factories for auto-         matically measuring the length of material produced         by a workman,    and
           (2)  instruments for measuring by counting,  such as              scales of unequal leverage which count a large              number of small  articles,  - e.g.,  screws -              by placing a fe?f in one  pan,  and the bulk in              the other.           The  proposal to bring suoh  instruments within the      scope of  the  Bill is concurred in  by  the Home Office.           The  measure  was introduced  in the  House of  Commons      in 1922,  but  made no progress.  There were no signs of      serious  opposition to it, however,  and  if  it were re-      introduced it could perhaps be got  through as a  non-      contentious measure.  A large number of local authorities,      motor and other associations,  manufacturers, etc., have      made  representations to  the Board  of  Trade in favour of      the Bill.                         (h) COASTGUARD  BILL.           The  Coastguard was  recently transferred from the      Admiralty to  the  Board of Trade; and  the former  consider      that  it  is necessary to  repeal or  amend the Coastguard      Service  Act,  1856,  by which the  Coastguard was put under      their control. As regards the tenure of lands and houses,      the Office of Works believe that legal  difficulties will      arise if  the  transfer of Admiralty leases  is not provided      for by statutory  enactment.  The Departments agree with      the proposed Bill and it will  probably  be  non-controversial.Board of Trade,  1st February, 1924.
