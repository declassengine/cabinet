fflTS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.     (Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade).     I have oarefully studied tho draft Bill to amend theTrade Facilities Acts, the Overseas Trade Acts, eto.,circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and would liketo call attention to the following pointsClause 1 (1).   I would suggest that the maximum limit shouldbe raised from  50,000,000 to  75,000,000 instead of to 65,000,000.    If business of a suitable kind should continueto come forward, it would be unfortunate if we were precluded from giving the required guarantees.Clause 1 (2).   I think that the date of expiry should beNovember 10th, 1925, instead of 1924,  The working of thescheme has necessarily been held up owing to its having been impossible to carry fresh legislation last autumn, and ifthe date is left at November 1924, it allows very little timefor propositions to be brought forward and the necessarynegotiations and arrangements in regard to guarantees to becarried through.     *n connection with this clause generally, I should beglad to be quite clear as to the Interpretation of the words in Section 1 (l) of the Trade Facilities Act of 10th November,1921, defining the purposes of loans which may be guaranteed.The section states that a loan can be* guaranteed if theprooeeds &quot;are to be applied towards or in connection withthe carrying out of any capital undertaking, or in, or inconnection with, the purchase of articles ....... required forthe purpose of any such undertaking&quot;.  Can these words beregarded as covering expenditure on maintenance and repair(24).CABINET.(Home Affairs Committee).Trade Facilities Bill.
work in connection with a capital undertaking?   If they donot include such expenditure, I think that an amendment of thesection is desirable.OlauBe 2  (l) (a).  The objects to which the proceeds of anyloan under this clause may be applied would appear to be more limited than in ths case of Section 1 of the Act of 1921.Under the clause,loans are only qualified of which the proceeds are to be applied &apos;&apos;by way of capital expenditure on or in connection with a public utility undertaking&quot;.  The term&quot;capital expenditure&quot; is no doubt somewhat indeterminate; butit would seem undesirable to have a different and apparentlynarrower definition for the business&apos;to be done under thisclause than for the Trade Paoilities business proper.  I would suggest that the definition.in the Trade Facilities Act might also be adopted here.Clause 2  (l) - last paragraph.  It is true that in the schemelaid before the Imperial Economic Conference it was suggestedthat the maximum grant of three-quarters of the interestoharges Bhould be for a period of five years, but I would submit that it is hardly necessary to make statutory thelimitation of the currency of the grant.  Cases might easilyarise in which it might be desirable to make, the grant for a longer period in order to secure business which might be perfectly sound in itself, although the Government orcorporation concerned had to ask for a longer period ofassistance in the payment of interest.  It would seempreferable to deal with this question by regulation whichcould be modified in exceptional cases if the Treasuryconcurred.
Clause 2 - (3). ,  In the scheme adopted by the EconomicConference, it was laid down that a scheme must be acceptedhy the Imperial Government within the next three years.  Inmaking this provision statutory, the Bill also prescribes thatthe Treasury is not  to give any  undertaking  in respect of a loan raised after the expiry of the three years.  The effect of thiprovision would appear to be, in practice, to reduce the periodof three years to something appreciably shorter, since therewould inevitably be some interval, perhaps a not inconsiderableinterval, between obtaining the Treasury undertaking and theactual raising of the loan.  Some limitation no doubt isnecessary to prevent abuse, but this could be provided for ineach case as part of the agreement for the undertaking to pay a proportion of the interest.Clause 3 (l).  In view of the time which has elapsed since itwas originally proposed to extend up to 8th September, 1925,&apos;the period within which guarantees under the Overseas Trade Actsmay be given, I am of opinion that the Bill should now providefor the period being extended up to the 8th September, 1926.     I may perhaps add that I have been considering whether any further alterations are required in the Export credits scheme in order to facilitate its utilisation.  No furtherchange which would involve statutory amendments appears to benecessary.  I am, however,  Inclined to think&apos;that it may bedesirable to modify the regulation which prescribes that, ifthe credit does not exceed 12 months a guarantee may be givenfor 100 per cent, of the total amount of the bill, but thatif the credit exceeds 12 months, the guarantee may only be
  be given to an extent not exceeding 85 per cant.  I  doubt  there being much ^justification for differentiating  between  these two classes of oredits,  and I think it would  be an .  improvementj and should lead to inoreased business,  if the  Department were authorised to give guarantees up  to the full  100 per oent. whatever the duration of the oredit.   This,  of oowse, would not mean that the Department should in all  oases give guarantees up to the full 100 per oentj  the  precise proportion of the guarantee in each case  would vary  with the oiroumstanoes, and would, as&apos;at present, be  carefully oonsidered by the Advisory Oommittee on whose  recommendations the Department acts.                                                 S.W.Board of Trade.   4th February, 1924.
