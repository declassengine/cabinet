MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a recent despatch fromSir Henry Dobbs dealing with the general political situation in Iraq.

CONFIDENTIAL.His Grace the Duke of Devonshire,    K.G., P.C., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O.,        Secretary of State for the Colonies,          .   Downing Street, London,  S.W.My Lord Duke,                     The Residency, Baghdad, January 10, 1924.    THEendof the calendar year, coinciding as it does with the practical completionof the Elections  for the Constituent Assembly of Iraq, seems to offer a convenient opportunity for a review of recent events in this country, and for an appreciation of the present situation.  Such a review is peculiarly appropriate, in that exactly ayear  has  now  elapsed  since the  functions  of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s  HighCommissioner were in effect transferred to my hands.  For Sir Percy Cox, although he did not technically vacate the post of High Commissioner until September last,left Iraq for England on the 20th January, 1923, to discuss affairs with the Cabinetin London,  and  only returned for  a  few  weeks before going on  leave in Maypreparatory to retirement.    2. At the beginning of the year 1923 the country had barely recovered from the crisis of the preceding August,  when the  agitation among the Arab  extremistsagainst  the British Mandate for Iraq  had culminated on the  anniversary of KingFaisals accession in a public insult to  the High Commissioner.   The belief was still prevalent that Great Britain designed to  make a second Egypt of Iraq and to rule behind an Arab facade, and the twenty years&apos; period of tutelage prescribed bythe Treaty of Alliance  between Great  Britain and Iraq, signed in October, 1922,confirmed this belief.  The  cry of the  extremists was that the real masters of thecountry were still the British officials  and that the Arab Government  was a sham.Revenue had been difficult to collect, and a deficit of about 80 lakhs of rupees wasapprehended in  the accounts of the  financial  year,  1922-23.   The people and government were doubtful of the intentions of Great Britain in regard to the claims on Mosul which the Turks, emboldened by their recent victory over the Greeks, wereactively pressing at the first  Conference of Lausanne,  and this doubt had  cast ablight upon all public affairs.  It had  been fostered by the press agitation in GreatBritain against the acceptance of  the Iraq Mandate.   The  presence of  Turkishirregulars at Rowanduz in Southern Kurdistan, well within the pre-war frontiers of Iraq, and the concentration of Turkish regular troops at Nisibin and Jazirah-ibn-Umar, to the north of Mosul, had spread unrest along the frontier, and especiallyin the Sulaimani division,  where the  religious leader,  Shaikh Mahmud,  recently-brought back from exile and installed as a barrier  against the Turks, was agitatingfor an independent Kurdistan and intriguing with the  Turks for support.   Thehesitations of British policy in the face of this Kurdish nationalist  programme hadfilled the  minds of the  Young Arabs with suspicion of  our intentions, and it was widely believed that we contemplated the creation of a Kurdish belt, under permanentBritish control,  which would perpetually dominate, from the  mountains, the arab population of Iraq.  The same suspicion was felt in regard to the aspirations of the assyrians for independence.  The leading Persian divines of the Shi&apos;ah sacred,citiesin Iraq  had taken, advantage of this general atmosphere of suspicion and unrest, - andhad  promulgated decrees  forbidding  the participation in the Elections  for theConstituent  Assembly  of  the Shi&apos;ahs, who form a  little more than half of theinhabitants,  on  the grounds that the  Assembly would be  forced to accept,  in thename of the nation, a puppet  Government  subject to foreign domination.   Inconsequence the Elections, which had started in October 1922, had hung fire and hadbeen allowed to  collapse, and there was no prospect that the Constituent assembly would be able, as had  been intended,  to sit  in January 1923 for the purpose ofratifying the Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain  and Iraq and laying dow*the  lines  of  the  future Constitution.   There was, in fact, a serious danger of aperpetual deadlock and of the emergence in Iraq  of political  conditions similar tothose obtaining in Palestine.  At the same time, the transfer of the command of theBritish Military forces in Iraq to  the Air Officer Commanding had only recentlybeen carried&apos; out, and  it was still doubtful whether the  increased and reorganisedAir Force, supported by.a reduced garrison of &quot; ground troops,&quot; would be able to       [11145]                                                       B 2
deal with the menace on the northern frontiers and the secular insubordination ofthe Arab, tribes on the, Euphrates.   Among these tribes a powerful party had arisenwhich had set itself in opposition to the Government of King Faisal and pretendedfor its own purposes, to desire a return of direct British rule.  This was a factormost embarrassing  to the British representative in Iraq, since, on the one hand, theadoption, by us of a severe attitude towards  the malcontents was alleged to be tantamount to the abandonment of our special adherents, whilst, on the other handany tenderness  towards them was misinterpreted as encouragement of seditionagainst the Iraq Government, with the object  of maintaining British influence inthe country.&apos;    3. The first necessity  of this situation was to convince the politically-mindedpart of the Iraq people of the disinterested attitude of  Great Britain and to disabusethem of  the suspicion that she was aiming at the perpetual domination of Iraq, asuspicion which persisted  in spite  of  the expressed reluctance of the  newly-electedConservative Government  of Great Britain to accept  the mandate for the country.The Administrative Inspectors Law, promulgated in January 1923, went a long way towards  achieving this end. It made it. clear that the whole executive of the country was to be;in the hands of  Iraqi officials and  that British officers would enjoy onlypowers of inspection and advice.  The Law was warmly received by the Arabic press,and it has during the past  year secured the most harmonious relations between Iraqiand British  officials.  Its effect was reinforced  at the beginning of May by theannouncement, made just before Sir Percy Cox left Iraq  for good, that the periodof the; Treaty between Great Britain and Iraq had been reduced from twenty to fouryears.  It is true that the more far-seeing people feared that the period was too shortto enable Iraq to stand upon her own legs, and that the so-called pro-British sectionsof the population, especially some of the Euphrates tribes, the inhabitants of Basrahand the Assyrians of Mosul, professed to regard this decision as a betrayal of their interests.  But  the politicians of  Baghdad and Mosul,  whose influence upon  thecountry  people is far more powerful than is generally admitted,  welcomed it withgreat enthusiasm, and even King Faisal and his Ministers, while expressing constantgratitude for the  support and favours received  in  the  past, were  undisguisedlydelighted that a near term had been put to authoritative control by Great Britain oftheir affairs.  The way was now cleared for genuine co-operation between the Britishand Iraqi:officials, and it  only remained to convince the people that Great britain was prepared to follow a  policy not merely of  abstention from undue interference,but also  of active support and friendship.     4. The next measure undertaken was the restoration of general confidence in face of Turkish threats.  For this purpose a force, composed partly of British and partly of Iraq  troops, moved up  to Mosul in January 1923, and His Highness the  AmirZaid, brother of King Faisal, took up his residence there to initiate political measures-for winning over Kurdish sentiment to the Iraq side and also to superintend theformation of a force of Arab  irregulars&apos;which would be able to protect againstTurkish&quot;  raids  the left flank of  the combined  British and Iraq  troops.   Thisdemonstration, combined with the  firm stand  taken by the British representatives at lausanne against Turkish pretensions, had  an  immediate effect over the  whole country, and telegrams and addresses  poured in from all  parts expressing the determination of the people to resist Turkish aggression.  The military preparationsoverawed the Turks, who  ceased thereafter from threatening movements beyond the frontier.  But the Turkish irregulars remained at Rowanduz, and the captureoftheir commander&apos;s correspondence revealed plans for a Kurdish rising in the springwith the co-operation of Shaikh Mahmud of Sulaimani.  To forestall such a combina- tion, Shaikh Mahmud&apos;s headquarters were bombed from the air, and  he took to  the mountains, while two columns of troops advanced on  Rowanduz, which the Turkish irregulars evacuated without fighting on the 24th April,  1923, two days before  the second Conference of Lausanne began its sittings.   A few weeks later Sulaimani was temporarily occupied and Shaikh Mahmud fled across the Persian border.  The British forces were then  withdrawn  and  Shaikh Mahmud returned in a chastened mood and accepted an arrangement by which the direct administration of the greater part of the Sulaimani division was transferred to the Iraq Government.  Since then the whole of Southern Kurdistan within the  Iraq boundaries has been, quiet and appears to  be  growing  daily more reconciled to incorporation in  Iraq, and  the suspicions of British intentions formerly felt in Arab circles have disappeared.     5.  In the meanwhile  a drastic scrutiny of the finances had been undertaken, as a result of which the actual deficit in the accounts for the financial year 1922-23 was
  reduced from the expected 80 lakhs to 15 lakhs of rupees (or about  100,000), while  in the Budget Estimates for the current year equilibrium was attained.  This should  make it possible for the Iraq Government to  float  a loan when required  for the  development of the country.     6.  The next step was to  put a stop to the &apos;agitation of the reactionary Shi&apos;ah  divines against the elections for the Constituent Assembly.  Their demeanour towards  King Faisal and towards  the Iraq Government had by  July become intolerably  arrogant, and King Faisal, after many hesitations, saw no other way than to authorise  the deportation of their  leader,  Shaikh Mahdi-al-Khalisi.   The deportation  was  arranged and  carried out  exclusively by Arab agency and was followed  by the  voluntary exodus to Persia of several other prominent Persian divines, as a public  protest.  The Iraq Government decided that it would be unsafe to permit any of  these personages to return before the conclusion of the elections and the ratification  by the Constituent Assembly of the Treaty of Alliance with Great Britain, and this  decision, although it caused agitation in Persia, was accepted as wise throughout  Iraq.  King Faisal had during this period made a progress throughout the whole  country for the purpose of  explaining his policy and exhorting the people to take  part in the elections; and  I  followed shortly afterwards  in his steps,  so that the people were left  in no doubt as to the identity  of purpose  of the British  and  Iraq Governments.  Having thus prepared the ground, the Iraq Government ordered that the elections should begin again,  and the completion  of the registration of primary electors, which had before been found impracticable, was everywhere carried through with success, the most distant tribesmen of the Euphrates and of the Kurdish hills enrolling themselves with astonishing alacrity.   The political  atmosphere had, in fact, cleared as if by magic and  the progress of the  elections,  notwithstanding the complications of the Electoral  Law, threatened to be so swift that it was necessary to delay it, for fear that  the Constituent  Assembly  should sit before the various agreements subsidiary to the Treaty of Alliance with Great Britain were ready for its consideration.     7. During all this period a main factor  in the pacification of the country has been the Royal Air Force.  By prompt demonstrations  on  the first sign of trouble carried out over any area affected, however distant, tribal insubordination has  been calmed before it  could grow dangerous, and  there has been an immense saving of blood, and treasure to the British and Iraq Governments. In earlier  times punitive columns would have had to struggle towards their objectives across deserts or through difficult defiles, compelled by the necessities of their preparations and marches to give time for their opponents to gain strength.  But now, almost before the would-be rebel has formulated his plans, the droning of the aeroplanes is heard overhead, and in the majority of cases their mere appearance is enough.  This domination of the country by aeroplanes has, however, its drawbacks.  In the first place, their passage is so easy that local officials are  apt to  ask for their help in circumstances in which police could be more properly used, or sometimes in order to help themselves out  of difficulties caused by mistakes of their own administration. All applications from  the Iraq Government for air action are therefore scrutinised by me  most carefully  before I endorse them, and no  air operation is carried  out without a full preliminary  report by a British Administrative Inspector. In the second place, a result of such  complete dependence on the aeroplane is that the Iraqi troops have never yet been tested.  The funds in the  Iraq Defence Budget are so limited that there is no money for troop movements which are not absolutely necessary, and the Air Officer Commanding is unwilling to allow untried troops to risk a defeat which might cause all the unruly elements in the land suddenly to flare up.  This is perhaps the only really disquieting feature in the present situation.   The British Air Force will be withdrawn in four years&apos; time,  if  not earlier, and,  unless the  Iraq Government has before that been permitted and been able to form an efficient Air Force of its  own, its Army  will  find itself confronted by the formidable task of keeping order among a population which will know that the force chiefly dreaded by it has left the country.  The Iraq Govern- ment is fully alive to this danger, and is devoting much thought to the expansion and training of its Army with the help of British Military Officers, whose services have been lent to  it.  The  Air Officer  Commanding has expressed his satisfaction with the appearance and training of the Iraq troops, and it, as now seems probable, tho Iraq Government consents to their being trained under  the executive command oi British officers,  there is every reason to hope that they will, when the time comes, be strong enough.  They  are supplemented by an admirable Police force, the only defectof which is the comparative smallness of its numbers.
    &apos;8. Another potential source of weakness has been the want of sympathy betweenthe towns  population and the tribesmen.   The Iraq officials are necessarily  drawn from the educated inhabitants of the towns.  They look upon tribesmen as savagesand desire to break up the tribal organisation  and to deprive the tribal leaders3 of power.  This is a natural wish, but it is foolish to try and carry it out without themeans of doing so.   The advice which from time to time I have given  the IraqGovernment has been largely directed towards securing a proper  appreciation bythem of thei tribal situation.  I am glad to say that the executive has recently taken the tribal leaders more into consultation and has sought to enlist their support.  Inthe&apos; elections for the Constituent Assembly matters have been so arranged that the tribesmen, outnumbering as they do the inhabitants of the towns and settled villages.will have&apos;their  full share of  representation, and they will consequently be able to influence the Administration more than ever before.    i 9. Concerning the political life of the country it is difficult to speau.  An Iraqnationality  has hardly yet developed.   Men  feel the ties of loyalty to their tribe or their town,or family, but as yet little to their country.  There are no parties, and not even any clear personal programmes, and few outstanding characters have yet shown themselves.   King Faisalj in spite of a disconcerting mutability of temper, is easilypredominant. The people are growing used to his  rule, and his personal charm gainshim an increasing number of  adherents.  He recognises fully his obligations to theBritish, but he has to keep his eye constantly fixed on possible  developments after our departure, and to guard,  above all, against the allegation that he is a puppetKing, propped up by our bayonets,, who is willing to sacrifice the true interests of thecountry in order  to keep in our good graces.   He can hope to strike roots in the soilonly by an attitude of independence, and we must therefore look with indulgence upon any opposition on his part to  our wishes, when  those  wishes run counter to popularclamour.  The aim of our policy in Iraq is,  after  all, to leave the Iraq Governmentstrong enough to hold its own and friendly to us, and it would be an absurd anti-climax if we simultaneously weakened and antagonised that Government by insisting on its always tamely accepting our views.  We shall have to bear this consideration in mind more than ever when representative Government is installed and when the criticisms now whispered in the;coffee-houses come to be openly pronounced  in  theAssembly.   Such criticisms are likely  to be concentrated  mainly upon our financial policy towards Iraq.   The Arab attitude is that we entered and conquered Iraq notto benefit its inhabitants but to injure the Turks, and that we incidentally builtrailways,  roads, bridges, telegraph lines, canals and  a port to  secure our militaryends.  These were not even planned with a view  mainly to the development  of  thecountry,  and the alignments  of  the railways and telegraphs especially will haveeventually-to be  largely altered.   Tbey admit that these works have been of hugebenefit to  the country, and that, if they were now to be&apos;taken away, it  would be a severe blow  to their well-being. But they argue that it is unfair that we should nowinsist on being repaid something approaching the full value of these works, which weundertook for our own advantage, by a people who are already taxing tbemselves^ totheir utmost in order to bring their administration UD to the high standards whichwe require of them.  This is hardly consistent, they allege, with our professed desire for their strength and contentment.-     10. Material prosperity has been disappointingly held back by the poverty ofthe outside world since the War.1  Germany and Levant no longer eat the dates on theexport of which Basrah used  to flourish, while the wool, hides and corn of the restof the country have also been in less demand.  Above all, the ruin of the north of persia, through the stoppage of its commerce with Russia has diminished the formerlylarge transit trade between Persia and the Gulf upon  which  the fortunes  of  the merchants of Iraq  largely rested.  Had not these untoward  outside circumstancesbeen counterbalanced by increased internal security and by the facilities of transportintroduced by us, their effect would have been crushing.   In fact the result has beenthat the people find themselves pretty nearly upon the same level of prosperity as theyhad attained before the  War and, ignoring the  adverse factors  above described,which are beyond the control  of any Government, they complain that they are not much better off than they were under the Turks.  When once the trade of the outside world has begun to move, Iraq will be able to take full advantage of the improvementsmade under our control and will, I believe, enjoy an era of unprecedented  prosperity.This  will be helped forward by the cultivation of  long staple cotton which is beingeagerly taken up by the more progressive landlords both urban and tribal and which under irrigation gives a very high yield in the long Mesopotamian sumiw,   Irri-
cation syndicates are already asking for concessions, and before many years pass theo-enerosity of England towards Iraq should be more than repaid, by the increasedprosperity of the workers in the Lancashire cotton-mills.    11.  But it is in another sphere that Great Britain may look to reap  the chiefreward for her work in Iraq.  The unfortunate working of events since the War andthe clash of policies has caused Great Britain to take, in oriental eyes, the place ofImperialist Russia as the ogre of Asia.  She has temporarly lost her reputation asthe defender of liberties and is consequently regarded as a common tyrant and land-grabber;  So widespread is this conviction that it is shaking the  foundations of hercommerce, and political rancour against her bids  fair to make  insecure the mainchannel for her trade with the East.  Iraq, if an enlightened and  consistent policy ispursued, will stand in shining contrast against this dull background.  Her intelligentand versatile people will be united in feelings of  affection and  gratitude towardsGreat Britain who will have rescued them from the Turk, kept her pledges to themand taught them to walk in the paths of freedom  before withdrawing the support and guidance of her hands.  This will be an example which cannot be lost upon therest of the East and will help to restore the splendour of the name of Great Britainand to draw to her once more the hearts of men.  Her bread will not have been castupon the waters in vain.                                       I have, &amp;c.                                           H. DOBBS,                                                High Commissioner for Iraq.
