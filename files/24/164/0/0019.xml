IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CRET,       CABINET.OLD .AGE  TENSIONSCOPY NO:Memorandum by the Ministas? of Health, agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour.          The estimated cost of the present scheme of old age Pensions Is  24,000,000 in 1925 Increased to  40,000,000in 1945.   The Increase in cost is due to greater longevityand the greater4 number of births two generations ago, and itshould be noted that the figures quoted do not allow for a stillfurther increase in longevity in the future,   accordingly the financial problem involved In the existing scheme is veryformidable and due regard must be paid to this in considering any amendment8 of the existing scheme which will increase the -charge on the taxpayer.          The situation, however, is that practically all members of the Party have given pledges, mostly directed to theremoval of what is called &quot;the penalty of thrift0 in theexisting scheme, and in the Prime Minister&apos;s election address the following words occur - &quot;More particularly should wo devoteour attention to Investigating and getting rid of the Incon-eistenclea and the discouragement of thrift at presentassociated with the working of old age pensions,   The encourage-ment  of thrift and independence must be the underlying principleof our  social reforms&quot;.          The means which must be taken into account in assessinga claim to old age pension may be broadly sub-divided intoclasses  (a)  earnings,  O) savings, which may be in the form ofoapltal Investments or payments by trade unions of friendly societies or other such bodies, by virtue of past contributions,or  (c)  charity.
          Thrift, strictly so called,  1B represented by thesecond of these classes, but It will he appreciated that,  on merits, it is somewhat difficult to maintain the position  thatthe results of thrift of this kind should be exempted from the calculation of means, whereas the results of work in the shape of earnings should not be so exempted.   Accordingly if the precedent of thrift exemption is started, it should he realised that .it may In practice  lead to the abolition of the other elements of means now taken into account in calculating pensions,          There is, however, a precedent in Australia forleaving out of account In the calculation of means any paymentsreceived by way of benefit from any registered friendly societyor during illness, infirmity or old age from any trade union or provident society, or other society or association, and ifit is felt that on the political ground something must he  done,it would probably be best to see whether action on these linesis not feasible,  &apos;          Further It would be  only fair to  include&apos;savings bank deposits, Houses bought through Building Societies andother  investments due to thrift,          No figures unfortunately are available showing what  the total additional charge resulting from such a plan would be,    An examination was made of the  particulars of some10 per  cent,  of  the  61  thousand odd pensioners who on 31stMarch,  1923,  were in receipt of pensions of  less than 10/- aweefc,  i,e, who suffered some abatement on account of possessionof means  of  some kind or another.   The total number of cases analysed was 6,412 and  of these  it appears  that  the number of cases  In which the means were  derived  to  the extent of more than one-half from various  defined sources  are as follows
