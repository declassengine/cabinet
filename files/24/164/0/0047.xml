     [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                    Printed for the Cabinet.     February 1924.SECRET.                                  &apos;  .       &apos;CP. 46(24).                    .          &quot;.:,  -             L  ;, -Memorandum  by  the Secretary  of State for India  for  the information of  the    Cabinet on the points of greatest  immediate importance  in Indian affairs.                               AFGHANISTAN.    By  the  Treaty  of  22nd November  1921 (the  Dobbs  Treaty)  a  state  of&quot;neighbourly  relations&quot;  was  established with Afghanistan.   This treaty  is  forthree years certain, but is terminable on  12 months&apos; notice, which can be  given by either party after the 22nd November 1923.    Within a few,weeks of  its  signature two  serious  raids  across the frontierinto  British  territory  were  made  and  others  were  made- later.   For  thesereparation on a very moderate scale lias  recently been extracted  after 18 months ormore of continuous pressure.  Notwithstanding  these  raids and the reluctance of theAfghan  Government to admit responsibility in regard to them, it was  held, up  toabout March 1923, that the Afghan Government was  striving, according to its lights,to act up to its obligations  as a  &quot;neighbour.&quot;  In  April last, however, the british minister  at Kabul  reported that a distinctly  anti-British,  tendency had  become evident  in Afghan  policy,  and  the  effect of  this  deterioration  of  relations was emphasised by the perpetration immediately afterwards of murders in British territory of British  officers  and ladies, in one  case  by  Afghan tribesmen, in the others  bytribesmen from the British side of the  line who found  refuge in Afghanistan, or  from there committed further outrages.  During the summer also it was established thatthe Afghan authorities,  who habitually  strive to maintain  connection with  the&quot;hostile&quot;   elements  among  the  tribes  on  the  British side   of  the  frontier,  had developed a system  whereby these  elements in Waziristan were  regularly paid as members of an irregular Afghan force (Khassadars) employed  in British territory.  - All these factors, to which should be added  the employment in Afghan militia of nearly 100 deserters from British frontier&apos;Corps, forced His Majesty&apos;s Government tothe belief that the &quot; intentions &quot; of the Afghan Government  were no longer  &quot; friendly &apos;.&apos;(Dobbs Treaty, Art. VI) and that it had &quot; determined on an  unfriendly and  provocativecourse  of  policy &quot;  (ibid,  Appendix  I). &apos; Accordingly  at the  end  of  September theBritish Government,  after  several protests against  the Afghans&apos;failure to arrest themurderers  and warnings of the consequences,&apos;exercised  ifs treaty rights  and refusedtransit  through India  of a  consignment  of munitions  purchased in  France ;  on11th November a formal Note was presented  setting out His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentsdemands in the way of proof of Afghanistan^ &quot; neighbourly &quot; intentions.   This having-had  no result,  at  the beginning  of  December His Majesty&apos;s  Minister intimatedinformally that, failing early satisfaction of these demands, His Majesty&apos;s  Legation in   * This fact has not been made public,  ^bul would be  withdrawn,*  and to show that                                  this was no  empty  threat  the ladies  of theBritish, community were sent down to India.  This  cumulative pressure has had: someappreciable result.   The Afghan  Government took more energetic action  against twoof the murder gangs.    Since 14th January the  following further evidence has been received  of the goodeffects of the constant pressure exercised on the Afghan Government.     The Kohat murder gang surrendered about 12th January to the Afghan forces,and have been taken to Kabul for  ultimate removal to Afghan Turkestan.     On 20th January the matter of  the raid on  the Kurram militia in October 1922was finally compromised by the payment of a reduced amount of compensation in cashand the restoration of two rifles.     On the same day one of the two murderers of Captain 13aher-.Jones was stated bythe  Afghan Government to  be  being brought to  Kabul for removal  to  AfghanTurkestan, though no specific demand had been made  for this.     On 21st January the two Landi Kotal  murderers  are  said  to have come intocollision with Afghan troops, aud  though oue escaped, one is reported to have been lulled.     7043   100 2.24  &apos;                                       &quot;
     As  regards  the murderers  of  Major Finn-is,; the  Afghan  Foreign Minister on22nd January renewed his assurances that they  were not within  aud would be excluded  from Afghan territory,  or if found there would be sent to Kabul underarrest; but he said his Government did  not now know the;whereabouts of the relationswho  have been allowed to slip from Afghan hold, and the opportunity has been lost to exert pressure oh the murderers through their relatives.     The  demands in regard to the employment of British tribesmen as khassadarsand the dismissal of British deserters serving in the Afghan militia are also claimed by the  Afghan  Government to  have  been met, but better  proof than their  mereassertion is still being sought.      , ,  .  .  .  .      \\\     The situation appears to be steadily  improving and now involves no  immediatecause for anxiety.                                    SWARAJ.     Swaraj self-government or  &quot; home rule &quot;-is the  name adopted by that section-of  the Indian  National Congress  organisation  (now completely  controlled  by thefollowers of Mr.  Gandhi&apos;s non-co-operation  creed), which, after much discussion,.obtained a few months  ago the assent  of the Congress  to the abandonment by  thoseof its members who  enrolled themselves under the  swarajist banner of the policy ofboycotting the Legislative Councils,  which had been adopted by the Congress at, thefirst  elections of 1920.  The election&apos; manifesto  of the  party,  signed by Mr.  MotilalNehru, 14th October 1923, states that the party believes &quot;that the guiding motive ofthe British in governing India  is to  serve the selfish interests of their own country,and that  the so-called  reforms are  a mere blind  to further the said interests underthe pretence of granting responsible government to India, the real object being tocontinue the exploitation of the unlimited resources of the country  by keeping Indianspermanently in  a subservient position to Britain, and  denying  them at  home andabroad the. most elementary rights  of citizenship.  It is daily becoming abundantly clear that the British, while professing equality of treatment, are in practice subjectingthe whole Indian nation  to  humiliation  and  insult in  all parts  of the world whereBritish influence is  supreme.  The  party notes  with pride and  satisfaction that thepeople of India are resolved to submit  no longer to the  national humiliation imposedupon them by the autocratic will  of  their British  rulers,  and in full concurrence withthe Congress expresses its emphatic opinion that Indians have no option but to continueto carry  on a  policy of progressive non-violent  non-co-operation with the present-system of Government until it is radically changed  in accordance  with the will of thepeople expressed through their chosen representatives.&quot;     The  immediate objective  of  the  party has been  declared  to be &quot;the  speedyattainment of full Dominion status, that  is,  the seciiring of  the right to frame  a constitution adopting such machinery and system as are most suited to the conditions and to the genius of the people.&quot;   The intention was expressed  in the manifesto to&quot;present on behalf  of  the country its legitimate  demands as formulated by the partyas soon as the elections are over aud ask for their acceptance and  fulfilment within  areasonable time  by  the Government,&quot;  failing  which  the elected  members  of thevarious Councils  belonging  to the  party would  be instructed  to &quot; adopt, a policy ofuniform, continuous and  consistent  obstruction  within  the Councils with a view tomake Government through the Councils impossible,&quot; but it was added that &quot; beforeadopting  such a- policy the representatives of  the  party  in  the Councils will, ifnecessary, strengthen themselves by obtaining an express mandate from the electorates.in this behalf.&quot;   -  Except as far as hereinafter mentioned, the &quot;legitimate demands of the country&quot;do not  appear to have yet been formulated and  presented; there is, consequently no precise Indication of the nature of the Constitution to be demanded.  But the leader of the party--Mr. Motilal Nehru--who has obtained a seat in the Assembly, explained in the manifesto  quoted above that  &quot; as a necessary preliminary to the right to Lametheir own constitution of xSwarajya the people of India must obtain an effective.controlof the existing machinery and system of Government  ...  .   It (the party) will notconcern  itself with  trivial reforms io the various departments of the administration to  be obtained  by the  grace of. the  Government, but will  insist on a  transfer of thepower to  effect the necessary reforms from  the bureaHfiilficy to  tho people themselves   ,   .-.    Under existing conditions the party considers  it an abuse of the suffrage of the  Indian electorate on the part&apos;of  its  representatives to engage in such questions asthe readjustment of the powers and duties of the Secretary of State, the Government of
India, the Provincial  Governments and  various other officials.  The Swarajya &quot;partymaintains that the powers those functionaries exercise vest in the,people by right and can only be properly exercised by their representatives.&quot;  It is further explained thatthe party are perfectly well aware that their demands would, be beyond  the power ofthe Government  of India - a mere1 &quot; agent of the, British  Cabinet.&quot; to  accept &quot;orreject.   The  demand  would,  therefore,  be  addressed to.:&apos;the,.principal through itsaccredited agent.&quot;    It .is difficult to  estimate the voting,strength of the Swarajists &quot;in the variousCouncils, because it is  not known how far  those who have  secured  seats on theSwarajist ticket will in  fact submit  fully to  party discipline, nor on the other handhow far  those elected as &quot; Independents &quot;  or  even as Liberals may, in practice, actwith the Swarajists.  In  one Council (the Central Provinces) they have an absolutemajority (44  out of a total of 70, of which 54 are elected).   Of the 10 elected membersnot professedly Swarajists, six are &quot;Independents &quot; who are expected to act with theSwarajists.   In  Bengal,  Swarajists number  36  out of 110 elected members (total strength of  Council,  140).  Here there are  13 Independents  who  are expected to vote with the Swarajists.  Press telegrams  indicate that in a division a few days agoon  a motion urging  the  release  of  all &quot; political&quot;  prisoners, only five non-official members appear  to have  voted with, the Government against the motion, which was thus carried  by a large majority.   In  Bombay the party has  about 35  seats out of atotal of  111 (86 elected), in the United Provinces about 31 out of  a total of 123 (100elected), and in  the . Punjab 28 (including Khilafatists and Parbandhak CommitteeSikhs) out of a total of 93 (71 elected).  In Madras, Bihar and Assam the Swarajistsare comparatively few.   In the Central Provinces and Bengal the Swarajists  were offered Ministerial office, but refused.    The Government of India have estimated the state of parties in the LegislativeAssembly as  follows :       Swarajists   -      -       -      -       -     ,-      -41      Independents who will almost certainly vote with Swarajists   7      Gurdwara Sikhs     -       -       -       -      7      -   2      Burmans    -       -       -       -&apos;             --3                                           -                   --53      &quot; Moderates&quot;  .     -       -       -      -      -      -  27.      Liberals and Loyalists      -       -       -      -          8.

Total  strength         145    -  (including President), of whom 26, including                                         President, are officials.    Resolutions of the Party Organisation, the text of which appeared in the Indiannewspapers received by the mail  of the 28th, show that  elaborate instructions havebeen issued  in the event of the Party&apos;s  demands being refused, as to the steps to betaken by those of its members who are members of the Councils in which they are ina minority in fulfilment of the policy of obstruction.  The gist of them is that  theyare to abstain from participation  in  the Council&apos;s business  on occasions when theycan secure, sufficient supporters to defeat the Government.   The instructions extend to requiring  attendance at Council meetings in &quot; khaddar &quot; (homespun)  clothes.    Notice  of  the following  Resolutions  to be  moved  in the  Assembly by  Mr.Rangachariar on  the 5th and 7th February has beeu given and: these may presumablyhe  regarded  as  a first  formulation of  the demands  foreshadowed in  the SwarajyaParty&apos;s election manifesto :     (1)  &quot; This Assembly recommends to the  Governor-General in Council that he be         pleased  to take at a  very early date  the necessary steps  (including  if         necessary the  appointment  of  a&apos; Royal  Commission)  for  revising  the     .    Government of India Act  so  as  to secure  for India  full self-governing  ,&quot;;&apos;t,      dominion status within the  British Empire. and provincial autonomy in the in       provinces.&quot;      .;&apos;&apos;    ..\.-                     1      ,
          (2)  &quot; This Assembly recommends to  the Governor-General in Council that he he              pleased  to  take  early  steps  to  appoint  a Committee&apos;of Members  of the              Indian  Legislature to examine  and report upon further expansion of the              reforms possible under the Government of India Act, so as to secure-                   &quot;(i) the relaxation of  control of  the /Secretary of &quot;State  for  India                 over the Government of India ;                   &quot; (ii) the increase  of  scope of transferred  subjects  to  the  Ministers                 of the Provinces ;  and                  &quot;(iii) more extensive budget control  for this Assembly  and for local                 Legislatures over financial proposals of the respective Governments.&quot;          I propose to instruct the &quot;Viceroy as follows with regard to  these  Resolutions.      (The Viceroy&apos;? observations have been circulated). ,j                           Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy.          &quot;Your telegram of 28th January.  Rangachariar&apos;s resolutions.  I agree with your      views as expressed in para. 8 that both parts of the first resolution must be  opposed.          -With reference to para. 9, I do not think it desirable  to volunteer  a presumption      that changes in His  Majesty&apos;s Government  may  be looked to as opportunities  for      pressing changes in fundamental policy as to constitution of Government of  India,      which it has been established convention  to regard  as continuous and unaffected by      party  politics.   The  present  form  of the. constitution  is based on the policy  of      Parliament declared  in  the preamble to the Government  of India Act. 1919, namely,,      that it is to be regarded as a stage in  the development of self governing institutions      with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible  government in British India      as an integral part of the Empire.  This is uncompromisingly the policy of His Majesty&apos;s      present  Government as  it has been that  of their predecessors in office since the Act      was framed.  This intermediate  form of constitution was necessarily in some degree      tentative and experimental, and is liable  to be modified within  the provisions of  the      Act.  Before, however, I can  concede  either that such extensions of  the reforms as      are contemplated in the second resolution may be regarded as calling for consideration,      whether by a Committee of the Indian  Legislature or otherwise,  i should  wish  to      know w;hat  definite  complaints  are made and  admitted by  your Government  of      inconveniences in the working of the Act, regarding it as a provision for efficiently      carrying on the Government of the country during  a transition period.  Whilst His      Majesty&apos;s  Government cannot admit, and  have not received any sufficient ground for      presuming, that the considerations which in 1919 were held to demand  provision for a      transitional constitution have  been substantially modified, they would be surprised to      find that the  precise form of constitution  framed had given absolute satisfaction in its      -working in all  details.  They are, therefore, entirely open  to  consider any clearly      formulated statement- of the precise points in which the present form of constitution      is felt to work  injuriously to.  the efficient carrying on of Government, in so  far as      these points  are not merely formulations of a general impatience with a partial and      transitional reform or a determination to make such form  of constitution unworkable*     in the hope of coercing His Majesty&apos;s Government into  the  grant of  a form of con-      stitution winch four years ago they were convinced, after the fullest and most  liberally      intentioned enquiry, would be more unworkable still.          I  agree  with your  view  that,  even  if  a  Parliamentary Commission were      to be  appointed  before 1929, which  the Act does  not  appear to me to prohibit,      but for which at present no convincing case  has been shown  to us, it could probably      not establish any facts which you  and the local  Governments, were not prepared      to  state and, advise  upon,  and also that the time  has   not  yet  arrived  and that      the  constitution  has  not  yet  been  sufficiently  tested  by  the experience  so  far      attained of the working of the Councils.   Moreover, useful experience cannot possibly      be obtained  unless the Councils are worked by all parties in good faith and with      goodwill  as  a  means, as  above stated,  of  carrying on the  government of  the      country as efficiently  as possible during  a transition stage,  and  with a willingness      to accept  any modifications  within the  Act which may  be  agreed to  be likely to      facilitate  such  efficient working.   I am.  therefore, entirely  willing  to give  you      discretion now to consult local Governments as to the possibility of further advances      under the Act, and to obtain materials for a judgment as to defects or possible reforms      /based  on practical argument and not on general ideas; of policy  in that manner or      any:,other which you may think suitable and desirable,    If such examination  should
lead you to consider  that there may be a case for considering the question of an earlyappointment of a Parliamentary Commission, I can. certainly not take the responsibilityof saying that this course woiilcl not be adopted.&quot;   (ffelegram ends.)     I have endeavoured to. aspertain: the causes of the recent.reinforcement of  theSwarajya movement, and what it is that could be pleaded as  the arguable basis of  thepremise I have quoted from  the  party&apos;s election  manifesto  of complete disbelief inthe honesty of British intentions of reform.  Apart from local irritants, administrative and social,  the two principal explanations which I have met with are :--     (1) Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech  in  the -blouse  of  Commons on 2nd August .1922,        which speech, I may observe,  departed somewhat disquietingly from  the        terms of the statement which  had been suggested to him  on  behalf  of        the  India Office ; and, much more,     (2) The  decisions, last summer, of  the  Colonial Office in connection with  the        Kenya controversy.     The grievances in this connection are three :       (A) Exclusion of Indians  from  the right to  purchase land in the Highlands. This is more  a sentimental than  a substantial grievance, and need not, 1 think,  be feared as a permanent and  important source of irritation.     (B) Apprehension of unfair immigration legislation. On this point  we have forthe present eased the situation, and I see that Lord  Reading has made good use ofthe effect of the telegram which I sent him  with the concurrence of  the Secretaryof Stf,te for  the  Colonies.   The local Government  introduced  a quite impossibleOrdinance  which has, indeed, had  a mischievous effect in  indicating the temperand  ideas  with which  the  local  Government  approach  the matter:  but  the-Colonial Office has  refused  to  consider  this  Ordinance  and  has  directed  thepreparation  of a fresh  one.  We  have  promised  that   we will fully  consider any  representations which the Government  of  India may  desire  to make  on  the revised Ordinance.   But  the Indian  community in  Kenya and  in India, andthe  Government  of India, desire a more fundamental preliminary reconsideration of this matter.  The argument  for immigration restriction rests upon the hypothesis that Indian immigration is  contrary to the economic interests of the native populationof Kenya.  . The  Government of India challenge this hypothesis, and  so far as I personally  am concerned (as I said publicly in a discussion, on this subject, promoted by the Aborigines Protection Society last May, at which all parties to tbe controversywere represented),  I am sceptical  on the subject and  see no a priori reason  forsupposing  that Indian immigration need be otherwise than  beneficial  to nativeAfrican interests.  Certainly Indian immigration into the West Indies was neverdetrimental,  but decidedly the reverse, to the economic interests  of the West Indianpeasantry  and proletariat  of African descent.   The  large settled  communities of east Africa  in Trinidad and  British Guiana both  are a valuable asset to thoseColonies, and contribute to the  prosperity of tbe Creole.  British Guiana  at  this moment is  begging the Government of India  to allow  a large scheme for immigrationof  Indians for settlement  in  that  territory.  The  Aborigines  Protection  Society,.holding a brief in  the first place for the natives of Africa as against Indian immigrants1,has never  regarded Indian immigration as deleterious to their interests.  The landsettlement  policy of  the British Government initiated by the Home Government  andthe labour policy favoured by the white settlers in Kenya are very much more dangerous and deleterious to the development of native agriculture and productive industry.The Government of India, therefore, aud I sympathise in their demand, desire thatan impartial  preliminary enquiry shall  be made as  to the effects on  the economic interests of natives in Kenya of the immigration of Indians.   We desire this to takethe  form of  examination of historical and concrete facts.  I have  not.of course beenin a position  to indicate  to the Government of India  that such  preliminary investi-gation can be made, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies is the responsibleauthority  in  the  matter.  I heard the arguments of  the Kenya Native department and of pro-settler  missionaries  on the  subject, and I must say  that I was  not-convinced,     (o) The  principal cause of offence, and by far the most serious and dangerousone, is the  decision  to establish  a communal  racial franchise for  Indians, thusdefinitely   introducing into a British  Crown Colony  a colour and  race distinctionbetween British subjects.  Probably all. the Members  of  the Cabinet appreciate  the
  critical nature of  this decision, but&apos; probably all do not appreciate how  enormously  it has exasperated Indian opinion.   All Indians in Kenya arid their sympathisers in  India are unshakeahly convinced that this decision of. thejate Government was simply  due to-the if ear ;pf  a  threat) of on insurgent action on tlie^part, of. the. white settlers  which the Colonial Office  know  had been carefully, organised and to which the Kenya  Indian Association assert  that the  Governor was privy:   When this  statement has  been made to me I have pointed out that, this was a very serious, thing  to  say, and  that, if they could prove it, it was.for them to give the.proof  to. the Colonial Office.  I do not know whether they have professed to do.so.  A demand is now being made  for  the recall of Sir Robert Coryndon on this ground.   Indians say (perhaps a little  too much ignoring.thedristory of, a similar position in Ulster), &quot;If  you had known of  a seditious  conspiracy in India, forcibly  to  establish a  Free State  and oust the  constitutional Government, you would have sent, sufficient force to be.prepared to  meet any such attempt.   In  Kenya you prefer to back down to this  threat at the  expense of the principles which you have repeatedly promised should  be  observed in  Imperial administration.&apos;&apos;       Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and. Mr. Sriuivasa Sastri take an extremely strong  line  upon this question,  and unless  a reasonable concession is made to the expectations  which Sir T. il. Sapru has founded upon what passed in the Imperial Conference, the  Government of India are  unlikely to get any further assistance from him or any  man  of his calibre in Colonial or Dominion questions or in maintaining a  modus vkendi  with the extremists.   In his  address to  the All-India National Liberal Association on  the 20th December last, he says, &quot;After the Kenya  decisions it was generally under-  stood  that the principle  of equality embodied in the  resolutions  of 1921 had been  abandoned, if not  directly at least by implication, and in important quarters there was  not  a  little nervousness  as to  what tho Conference might do if  anyone was rash  enough  to  raise  the  Indian question.   The result,  however, shows that at the  Conference of 1923 we have  secured a most valuable endorsement  of the  resolutions  of 1921.  Next, we have  reopened the Kenya  door, and there is reason now to hope  that justice may in the end prevail.   The Conference  has now definitely provided a  scheme for,machinery which, if rightly employed, will go far  in the future to secure . the. proper investigation and the due  remedy of  the  grievances under which Indians  labour whether  in the  Colonies  or in the  Dominions.&apos; Apart  from our  having  gained an unequivocal expression of goodwill towards our aspirations from the other  members of the British.  Commonwealth excluding South Africa a very important  constitutional  advance, has been  secured, namely,  the right of  the Government  of India to  negotiate  with the  Colonial Office through men  appointed by itself, for  this and no less is what  is explicitly provided if or an the formula.  Lastly,  we have  again  succeeded in  isolating  South  Africa.&quot;  SirT. B. Sapru, therefore, definitely  assumes that the decisions&apos; on  Kenya  questions arrived at last summer  are open to  revision.   The Duke  of  Devonsh.ire&apos;s statement  on this  point in  the  Conference  contains, however,  a  clause  which has probably  been  interpreted   by the white  ascendency party  in Kenya as barring any such retrospective  consideration of Kenya  questions, though  it is, I think, quite impossible to repudiate the promise with regard  to such questions  as that  of immigration.   So far as I have had opportunity to form  any judgment on the subject, it seems to me that this Kenya  controversy, ventilated  as it has been by such able Liberals as Sir T. B. Sapru and Mr. Sastri, has been the* most active cause  of the reinforcement, of the irreconcilable parly in India,  and 1 need   hardly point out that  the private interests  of English individuals  and the Imperial  interests jeopardised by that  reinforcement are incalculably greater than the private   and Imperial interests conceived to be  jeopardised- by any attempt to withstand the  demands of, the white settlers in Kenya.  I am not  able myself to defend the  policy   of racial distinction in regard to the franchise, and trust that I shall not be called on  to do so.  - The system of communal representation in India itself is  unsatisfactory  enough, but it is not professedly based  on race, but  rather  on religious and other   distinctions,&apos;  A. distinction of British citizenship based on race in a British Colony for  which  the  Home  Government  is responsible  is,  so  far as I am aware,  an entirely  new. departure andpne to winch, I, cannot,reconcile mysclL  I would much rather see  a less  ostensibly  Liberal form of,  constitution in, a,- co immunity where acute.;,racial   controversy arises.   Such.a.form is far less poisonous., This,  however,  is&quot; rather a   matter, for ,the.-.Cqlouial  secretary,  and  I;only express my, opinion as  one who has   had considerable contact1  with such questions in mixed communities.
SIKH TROUBLE.    The trouble  with tbe Sikhs: goes back  to the revolutionary  movement called.:&quot;Ghadr&quot; (rebellion) started:&apos;on: the west  coast of America in 1913-14.  It was theninflamed by the refusal- to -adin it Sikhs into . Canada,  more  especially-- those -who-chartered the steamship Komagata Mara,  and  on their retain  to India committed theriot at Budge Budge, near Calcutta, in  September 1914.   Early in the following yearthese  men and their sympathisers broke out in the Punjab.  The War and recruitment for the Army quieted this turbulence.    After tbe  War ended a movement grew among the Sikhs for  the  reform of theirreligious foundations. The movement; would  have met with sympathy from all if thereformers had  proceeded  by peaceable and  legal means.  But  their methods wereusually to  endeavour to  obtain possession by  force.   These methods resulted  innumerous fatal disputes, the most notable being that at  Nankana Sahib  in February1021, when the incumbent of the  foundation  massacred  a number of tbe Akalis, the active instruments of the reforming party.  Thereafter their efforts became more directly anti-Government and were particularly directed towards removing all influence of the Government from the management of the Golden Temple at Amritsar.  Matterscame to a head over a dispute at  a Gurdwara called Guru-ka-Bagh near Amritsar inthe months from August to  November  1922, during which 5,700 Akalis were  arrested.and  convicted for persisting in trespassing  on  land  that did not belong to them.They were all released in April 1923 in return for the good behaviour of some Akaiisduring disturbances between Hindus and Mohammedans at Amritsar in that month. For  a time  matters were  apparently quieter, but  when the  Maharaja of Nabhaabdicated in  July 1923, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak  Committee,  which is formed ostensibly for the management  of the foundations, decided  to make a proteston the ground that- the Government had removed the Maharaja in order to weaken theSikhs, and was bent on  crushing  the  community.  The  Committee  started  with-continuous demonstrations in the State  of Nabha by a series of bands despatched  fromBritish territories.     The Committee has also been responsible for other disorders,  particularly thecrimes of a body known as Babar  Akalis who  have committed murders and robberies against  loyal  Sikhs.  It has also maintained newspapers full  of open sedition.  In October 1923  all  the members of the Committee aud  other leading  Akalis  were-arrested and  prosecuted for sedition and waging war against  the King in Amritsar, after the Committee and the  Akali Dal (the organised body of  Akalis) bad  been proclaimed  illegal  associations.  The  trial is still going on.  The complaint alone-covers 36 printed foolscap folio pages.     Since the arrest of  the leaders there  have been two more incidents.  On the 7th January  62 members of the Committee holding a public meeting in Amritsar of the proclaimed unlawful association were arrested and are being prosecuted.   Between &quot;the 4th and  9fch  January a number of Akalis  endeavoured by force to seize land attached to a-  shrine near Lahore ;  184  were arrested and the majority convicted.  In both cases  the incidents did  not  arouse much attention and the local situation is reported to be quiet. The latest report from  the Punjab, which  gives particulars  up to the end of December, stated  that there were indications of  renewed activity in several  places on  the part of the Akalis, but  that  the  temper of  the people had improved.  Almost all the criminal Babar Akalis have been arrested.      The political bodies of India have offered assistance to  the Sikhs and appointed liaison officials to ascertain methods in which this assistance can be given.  The Sikhs do not  appear to  have  welcomed the idea  warmly, though  a  deputation,  of  them attended the Congress at  Cocanada.      The difficulties in  this matter arise largely from the inclusion in an ostensibly religious reform movement of numbers of political malcontents whose main aim  is to ^secure the revenues of the foundations to finance revolution.      The necessity for drastic reduction in the strength  of the Indian Army  after the war necessitated  the compulsory  retirement of  numbers of  Sikh soldiers,  many of whom had looked forward to a successful and  profitable career  in the Indian Army. There are, therefore, amongst the Akalis, many men who  have been in the Indian Army, who have been trained as  soldiers, and who are liable  to. attempt to influence the Sikh soldier in the rahks against the Government. :   :-           &apos;    ;:       -      Efforts baye frequently been made to tamper with, the. loyalty of the Sikh whilst -actually serving with units.  The danger.of  men being tariipered with, while actually serying with their units is hot so great as the danger which  exists when they are oh
leave and furlough in their  villages.  Moreover, pressure is often brought  to bear-on the  relatives oL men: serving, in order  to induce; them to persuade  the  servingsoldier to sever his connection with the Army.       Lid;;     The  Punjab  Government  have  recently, introduced, legislation providing thatany serving or&apos;ex-soldier  convicted of agitation&quot; against the&quot;Government shall be-liable to forfeit his pension or any land  or  monetary reward  that  he  has receivedfrom G-overnment.     It is impossible to say how far the loyalty of the Sikh soldier has been tamperedwith up to date, but it is  probable that  his  powers  of  resistance  to agitation have--been considerably lessened during recent years by the pressure brought- to bear inthe villages.   It may  be taken, however, that the Sikh  soldier serving with his unitis,  on the  whole,  loyal to Government, ;iand firmness and  decision in dealing withthe hostile agitator will assist  still further  to  consolidate and  ensure loyalty andinstil confidence.                                   GANDHI.     The  position  with  regard  to  Gandhi is this.  He has been  out  of prisonfor an operation for appendicitis, in  which the malignant genius of  Western sciencehas  saved  his  life.  The Viceroy is awaiting, a report from the Governor of  Bombayas to whether he is sufficiently recovered  for the question of his future detention to beconsidered.   He would propose that in any case it should be treated as internment andnot  as punitive.  He proposes to offer Gandhi his liberty on condition of  his giving an. undertaking, which he is sure he would observe, not  to engage in propaganda.  Itis, of course, very unlikely that  Gandhi  will give such an undertaking.  If he willnot, the Viceroy would deprecate in the  strongest possible terms, as certaini to  havemost mischievous and embarrassing results, his unconditional liberation at the presenttime.             POLITICAL PRISONERS  NOW  IN CONFINEMENT.     It is impossible here to say at any time how many political prisoners there are inIndia       (i)  no clear line can be drawn between &quot; politicals &quot; and others ;     (ii)  we never know exact details of all cases that may be classed, as political;     (iii)  sentences are in  actual execution up to as much as 25 per cent, shorter  than         their nominal length.     Some figures can, however, be given indicating how matters stand :      I.  Persons convicted of sedition, or causing enmity between classes, or conspiracyagainst the King.     The sentences  seldom exceed  two  years.  There  are now (including Gandhi)about 30 certainly in jail; while as to 16 others who were prosecuted  we have not had  definite statements as to the result of the trial.   (Perhaps seven of these are still under trial; the rest most probably  were  not convicted or did  not receive  long-sentences.)  These cases all refer to newspapers or speeches.   There may also be afew from earlier dates.     II.  Bengali middle-class revolutionaries, involved in a campaign of assassination ;State prisoners under  the State Prisoners Regulation, No. Ill of 1818.  These are 19in number   They have not been tried ;  but the cases against them are placed beforetwro High Court Judges for examination.     III.  Four  agents  (communists)  of  the Soviet Government or of M.  N.  Roy.detained as.State prisoners.     IV.  Leaving aside the special classes of  Moplahs in Madras, and Akalis in the punjab,  the numbers of persons convicted in cases arising out of politics, and still injail, were    -In April last, outside the United Provinces  and. the Punjab,  7 in Madras, 5 in bombay, .19 in Bengal, 19 in Bihar, 3  in tbe Central Provinces  and 14 in. Assam.Most of  these  were convicted as members or managers of unlawful associations, to.whom lengthy sentences cannot be given,  : The; probability is  thaVmost are by this time released, but,this is not quite certain.        1           &apos;    :In  the  Central Provinces  large numbers were  convicted in the Swaraj flagagitation, but they were all released when that was stopped.
    In the United Provinces,? two  months ago, the release of those still confined was again considered ; the figures reported are not plain, but  there &quot;are certainly 70, andprobably as many as 86 or 90 still confined. .,             -    V.&quot; The Moplahs in-Malabar have always, been subjected,to special control,, owingto their frequent rebellions.  In December 1922 there were about 132 of them detainedas State prisoners under  the Madras Regulation correspondence to  the  Bengal andBombay Regulations already mentioned.  There have been  additions to  the numbersince ; and there are now  at least 243, and possibly more, State prisoners of this class.    VI. There are some hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of actual Moplah rebels,concerned in  the outbreak of 1921, who must still be in confinement.  In November1922 the Madras Government stated that of 11.990  arrested, 123 had been convicted,and 3,150 were  still under trial.    VII. In the Punjab  the constant changes  in  the  struggle  between the AkaliSikhs and the Government make it difficult to give  even approximate figures.   Forinstance, between  September and November  1922,  the  arrests  and convictions inconnection with the  Gurnka Bagh  matter numbered 5,700.  But all still in jail were released in April 1923.   &apos; In October last it became necessary  to proceed against the Gurudwara Com-nrittee and the leaders of the Akalis.  58 of these are under trial and the complaintagainst  them gives a  connected  history  of Sikh  troubles  from October  1920 to october  1923.  Since it  Was lodged the  Government  has  had  to  proceed against62 more as members of unlawful  associations; and most of the  184 others arrestedfor forcible trespass on land that tliey claimed have been convicted.    There  must also  be  some remaining in jail of the 107 who  were  said to be confined in April last year in the Punjab for political offences.    It is evident that in the Punjab no definite&apos; figures  of value  can be given.   Thenumbers now, or shortly likely to be, iu jail must be very considerable.                        BOLS HE VIST   PROPAGANDA.    I have enquired  what  evidence there is  of action by the  Soviet Governmentdirected against the stability of the Indian Government.,  Some of the. cases in whichit was considered that indications of such activity had been  discovered, are embodied in Lord Ourzon&apos;s Despatch to the Soviet Government on the subject of such activities.Not very much  of  such  evidence is forthcoming;  what there is  relates to actiontraceable  only so far  as  to  the Third International: how far the Foreign Office are able to carry the responsibility from the Third International to the Soviet Government,I am not aware.    I have a Report from the Director of the Intelligence Bureau in India regardingcommunist activity against  India, written in July last.   The activities appear  to be entirely documentary and educational, though funds are provided by Government toacquire information regarding any import of arms, of the occurrence of which I findno evidence.  There does not appear to me to  be  anything in what is  disclosed of sufficient importance to call for any diplomatic notice of the matter.  The Governmentof India are  certainly  quite frightened  enough about this  propaganda to be relied upon  to  keep us posted  about anything in it which may be regarded as of seriousinternational importance.                                  FINANCE.    The budget  expenditure proposals  of the Government  have  been  disposedof.   They involved  various controversial questions into which I need not go, the mostimportant politically being one arising from the separation of the  Railway Budgetfrom  general expenditure.   The exemption of  stores imported for the railways fromduty having been abolished&quot;, the result of raising the heavy  duties now imposed upon such  stores and carrying them to general revenue would  be that  general revenue would profit heavily at the cost of the Railway Budget.   As the railways  are about to import great  quantities cf . stores for re-conditioning; and other capital  expenditure.for which they will&apos;borrow&apos; money, this would amount to the Government of Indiareceiving money in, aid of its revenue,at the cost of increasing the debits againstrailway capital account, for which the Government itself is ultimately responsible ;.. itwould be practically equivalent to the Government borrowing in aid of revenue.  WeIi
have therefore directed that the amount of duty levied on stores imported for railwayson capital account (but not on revenue account)  shall, be refunded to the railways bycredits to their capital account or in some equivalent fashion.  It will-be obvious thatthe grant of this drawback practically ^neutralises the advantage  which the fiscal policy which the Government of  India are more and more desirous to adopt wouldhave given to local producers of  capital stores,  principally the&apos;Tata Company.  this company, I may,say,.is; itself in considerable difficulties,;sp much  so that in order tocarry out one of its present contracts with  the  Government, it has had to apply for,and has received, an  advance of 350,0001. to pay their wages  bill, and presumablywill require further such assistance thus securing the&quot;, advantages of both protection and subsidy.               ......    I have not yet received the Viceroy&apos;s proposals as to taxation, but I have sent himmy views by telegraph with a view to avoiding any such controversy as arose last year with regard to. the Salt Tax and the.exercise of the power of certification.1st February 1921.SYDNEY  OLIVIER.
