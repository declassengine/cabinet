Demands for increases of wages are now being pressed by &quot;War Department work-men in the London  area  which  raise difficult and fundamental questions  as to  theprinciples by which wages of directly-employed Government labour should he determined.Consultation between officials of the Departments mainly interested has failed to find any satisfactory solution, and, as the matter has now become urgent, I think it right to laythe position before my colleagues.     2. The ultimate causes of the difficulty are two :- (a) The fact that while wages inthe  manufacturing industries exposed  to foreign competition,  and in particular  theengineering industry, have  been heavily reduced, wages in the  industries not so exposed especially the middleman and distributing industries are now disproportionately high ;and  (b) the fact that  there are in operation not one but three principles for determiningGovernment wages in  the London area, and the state of affairs existing under (a) bringsthem into  sharp conflict.     3. There are in the London area five principal War Office establishments :      (a) The Ordnance Factories  in Woolwich Arsenal,  essentially  an  engineering           establishment.    V                         *     (b) The Ordnance Store  Department at Woolwich, partly within the walls of the           Arsenal and  partly in  the  neighbouring Woolwich Dockyard, essentially a           warehousing establishment.     (c) The Ordnance Factories at Enfield  and Waltham  (see paragraph  6), of which           one is  an  engineering  and  the  other an  explosives factory  (a  chemical           industry).     (d) The Army Clothing Department at Pimlico, partly a tailoring factory employing           mainly women, BUT also a  branch of  the Ordnance  Store  Department,           employing men on warehousing work, similar to that at Woolwich.     (e) The Supply Reserve Depot at Deptford, warehousing provisions, &amp;c.     4. In March, 1910, after a debate on Army Estimates, the Government undertook to apply to directly-employed Government  workmen the principles of the Fair wages resolution of the  House of  Commons relating to wages paid by Government contractors ;i.e., it undertook to &quot; pay rates of wages and  observe hours of  labour not less favourable than those commonly recognized by employers and trade societies (or, in the absence ofsuch recognized wages and hours, those which  in practice prevail amongst good employers)in the trade in the district where the work is carried out.&quot;   Where  there  &quot; are no suchwages and  hours  recognized or prevailing in the district, those recognized or prevailing in the  nearest  district  in which the general  industrial circumstances are similar &quot; wereto be adopted.     5. From that date onward  the War Office has consistently endeavoured to settle itswages rates in general by applying  this  principle, which has  the great merit of removingsuch questions from the sphere of opinion or  policy to that of  fact ; but a  position  hasnow been reached in which the principle no longer holds the whole field.           *     6. For many years prior to 1910 it had been the practice to pay to  unskilled labour(except building labour, which was already covered by the agreements of that industry) inthe  London area, not only in War Department but also in other Government establish-ments, a uniform minimum wage, irrespective of the particular trade or  industry with whichthe labour  might  be associated.  This  uniform  rate for  the  principal War Departmentestablishments was originally laid down in 1897, after an enquiry conducted by the thenLabour Department of the Board of Trade into  the  wages  paid to unskilled labour OFTARIOUS kinds,  in factories, storehouses, railways and  SUNDRY out-door employments.   It     (B23/194) 110 1/24 W.O.P.  989                         ,,
 represented a generalised or average rate which was considered  to be fair according td&apos;;the standards then  prevailing,  and was  from time  to  time brought up to date as occasion demanded.  When this generalised rate was instituted, unskilled labour was not covened by the agreements subsisting between, e.g., the Engineering Unions  and their employers, and was only very imperfectly organizedand no objection  was raised to the rate as contravening the Fair Wages Resolution when the latter  was set up  as the governing principle.   :.   7.  During the Great  War two new features asserted themselves.   The Engineering Unions;&apos;as the Building Trades Unions had already done, began to provide in their agree- ments for their associated unskilled labour ; and it was found that in an establishment like Woolwich Arsenal an  advance given to a majority of the men employed,  such as the engineer advances of the war period, could not be withheld from other associated trades (e.g., saddlers and the building trades) in the same enclosure.   The consequence was that from 1915  onwards all labour, skilled and unskilled, in Woolwich Arsenal: and Woolwich Dockyard, though a separate enclosure, necessarily followed suit received the  engineer war advances, amounting  in  all  to 39s.  %d. a week plus 12^ per cent. ; so that in 1922 skilled men were drawing their  basic trade rates of 1914 with  engineer  advances, and unskilled men were drawing the generalized rate  of  1914 with engineer advances.   The unskilled  labour rate  so  produced  (74s. lQd.)  was  extended  to  all unskilled labour entitled to London rates.  In 1921. and the spring of 1922, the  12J per cent, and 6s. were taken off, the net advance  then standing at 3os. 6d.   So far there was no complaint.   &apos;&quot;-s      8. In 1922  the Federated Engineering Employers effected three cuts of 5s. Qd.  each in all engineering rates, skilled or unskilled, reducing the engineer war advance to 17s. (33s. 6d. jess 16s. %d.).  These cuts have been applied by the War Office to all who had received the engineer advances, with the following results : ;          Skilled engineers  are getting (standard day work rate) 59s. 6d. as against 42s. 6d.     in 1914, and allowing the usual 6d. in the    for Government benefits (gratuity, &amp;c.),     this is practically equivalent to the present rate of 60s.-lid. in Federated shops.          Skilled men of other trades  are  getting  their 1914  basic rates, plus 17s.   For     saddlers  this is 53s.,  while the trade district rate  is  now 66s.  Id.  [The saddlers     have, however, still gained on their total receipts since 1914.]          Unskilled labourers are getting 44s.  When the Great War broke out the rate     had just been  raised  from  24s.  to 25s. ;  and  from  Christmas, 1914,  on the     recommendation of the  Committee  on Production  it was further raised  to  27s.,     to which is added the net engineer advance of 17s.     9. Complaints&quot; have since been raised as follows :                       -     (a) By the  Woolwich  Arsenal  shop  stewards who claimed   on behalf  of  all            concerned, skilled and unskilled, an advance of 11s. on present rates, on the            ground that many good employers have foregone either the last of the three            cuts  of 5s. 6d. or the last two.     (5) By non-engineering skilled trades, and  in particular the saddlers  at Woolwich,            who  claimed their own district rate under the Fair Wages Resolution.     (c) By the Ordnance Department  men  at  Pimlico,  who claimed  that  they  have            nothing to  do with  engineering and should not  suffer engineer cuts,  and            that their wages, compared with Iheir  own trade of warehousemen, are not ill            accordance with the Fair Wages Resolution.     As regards (b) and (c), it must  be admitted that the rates paid, judged by theResolution alone, are below the standard ; and as regards (c)  in particular,  it is not easy to frame a convincing reply to the claim.     10. The  matter has  been very fully&quot; discussed in the  War Office and by the official side  of  the Co-ordinating Committee of the Whitley Councils  for Government  industrial establishments.  Apart from maintaining the status quo, and from such heroic remediesas removing all  industrial establishments from London, only two  alternatives worthdiscussing have come to light     ,     (a)  To give up all generalized rates,  whether  for skilled or unskilled labour, and pay            differential  labour  rates   in  different  Wades,  or  at  least  in  different            enclosures ; or,     (J) To adhere to the generalized unskilled rate and now have a fresh rate calculated,            taking into account both rates paid in  factories and those paid in warehouses            and other industries.                                                 -1 *
     11. The heads of the War Department labour establishments concerned, who are indirect  touch with the men,  are  unanimously  and definitely of opinion  that the. linosuggested  in (a) cannot  he. held. ,  .As  regards (b),  under  present conditions  thegeneralized London labour rate, if calculated on the same lines as before, would probably1b.e: at  least. 5s.  above the existing rate of 44s.  It would not be  possible to main-tain  such  a difference between  the wages of two  labourers working in the  factory and Store departments respectively in the  Arsenal, or between  two Store Departmentlabourers in the Arsenal and Dockyard, or between the Dockyard and Deptford or Pimlico.   -On the other hand, the Director-General of Factories is equally emphatic in his viewthat, it would not be possible to raise the rate of unskilled labour in the Factories by suchan amount without the rise spreading to the skilled men ; and this  is not  to be thought of, as it might well precipitate a crisis in the whole engineering trade.  -  12. Friendly  informal  discussions  have.  been  held  with  Labour Members  ofParliament, in which the difficulties were plainly put before them and they were asked toascertain,   in communication with the men&apos;s  organizations,  what  the attitude  of theworkers themselves was likely to be to alternative (a) of paragraph 10.    13. On 1st August  I  received deputations of representatives of the men,  supported.by the two  Members  for Woolwich and four  other  Members of Parliament.  Theprincipal arguments employed were     (a) That the wages of unskilled men (44s.), however arrived at, were below the level           of a present day living wage,  as  shown  by the fact  that  the  Woolwich           guardians&apos; relief scale gave for a man with  wife a&apos;nd three children 42s. 6rf.*           a week, and with five children 50s. 6d,* a  week ; that men in the employment           of the West Ham Municipality were then getting a minimum wage of 67s. M.;           and that the Southborough Committee had  recently fixed the minimum wage           of Government clerical employees at  176 a year (67s. 8d. a week).    (b) That the engineering cuts had been forced on the men unfairly by the employers           and did not constitute a  &quot; recognized &quot;  rate, and that the  London County           Council, many municipalities  and  &quot; good&quot;  (i.e.,  non-federated)  employers           had not exacted the whole of  the  cuts.   The  Fair  Wages Resolution only           provides that the  Government shall pay not less than  the outside trade rate,           and  Government  ought  to  follow  the example of  the best employers,           including municipal bodies.    (c) That skilled men were not getting the cost-of-living  advance upon their 1914           rates,  even accepting  the present method of calculating the index number           as correct.     14.  As regards (a), the claim is in substance that the Government should abandon the de facto basis of  the Fair Wages Resolution.   If considerations of cost  of living,&amp;c, are admitted, and it is conceded (as I think it must be)  that  the 2s. advance ofDecember, 1914, should be treated as a basic increase and not  as  a  war advance,  thepresent equivalent of the basic rate of  27s.,  with a  cost-of-living index of 177  per cent.,would be 47s. M.     15.  In this connection, it may be mentioned that in November 1922, the Trade union side of the Engineering Trade Joint Whitley Council, after a claim for the restoration toall Government employees affected of the reduction of 16s. 6d. referred to in paragraph 8had  been  negatived, raised the whole  question of the present  basis  of the  Fair wages resolution, and tabled a resolution in the following terms :          &apos;:&apos; This Joint Industrial Council for Government engineering establishments is of     opinion that the Fair  Wages Resolution  of the House  of  Commons, as at present     applied to Government  departmental  employees, pays  insufficient regard  to,  the     essential difference between  State employment  and employment  in outside industry.     It is, in effect, making the State the ally of the industrial federations and combines in     an. attempt to reduce the standard of wages of the workers in order to maintain high     rates of profits on notoriously over-capitalised concerns.   It  therefore  urges  the     Government, pending  a general  enquiry into  wages, prices, and  profits,. to set a     standard of wages which will ensure to the workers sufficient  to maintain themselves     and their dependants in a state  of mental, physical and industrial efficiency.&quot;     They have since  supplemented this  resolution  by a  memorandum amplifying thesecontentions.             *  Including Is. 6D. for coal, to be increased to 3S. in winter.
  &quot;i&apos; !;&apos;:16:&apos;&quot;A&apos;s regards (b), it cannot be seriously contested -that the Federation&apos;rate, if not  recOgnizedy&quot; is,:in the language of the Fair Wages  Resolution,- &quot; that which in practice prevails amongst good employers &quot; in the engineering industry it has always been firmly held  that  municipal rates  of  wages  cannot  be accepted as setting fhe  standard for Government, wages under the  Resolution ;  arid in view of the&apos; reaction of  Government wages upon those of private employers under present conditions, it is not practicable for Government to set a standard higher than that accepted in outside: employment.     17.  As regards (c), the whole principle of the war advances (other than the 12J per cent.) was&apos;that they were applied to  skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled alike as fiat rates, and not as percentages of increase on basic rates.   The same result-that the maximum proportionate, benefit falls to the worst-paid  man is a main feature  of the war bonus scheme ;&apos; and it  cannot be claimed that on the flat rate system the best-paid man is to have his full index number advance, with the result that the lower-paid men would get a  good deaf more.-     18. It was  finally stated at the deputation, on behalf of the Woolwich men, that  after full consideration the various trades in the Arsenal would prefer to be  treated uniformly, rather than according to the outside hours and rates of each trade ;  and it was also stated on behalf  of the Pimlico men  that  they would accept that principle if the War Office found it necessary to adopt it.   This attitude is satisfactory, because the difficulties of administration involved  in  the contrary principle are prohibitive ; but it  does  not of course imply the acceptance of an engineering unskilled rate for the Pimlico men.     19. It still  remains to deal with two points-one of form and one of substance.  It is very desirable  to secure  some form of parliamentary authority for the practice of according  &quot; generalized&quot; treatment to  different  trades  within the same  Government enclosure, or different enclosures connected with the  same industry, or in the same area. This is necessary because the Resolution, in terms, permits no other course than payment of&apos;at least the district rate to each and  every separate  trade.    20. The point of substance is whether, in view of the complaints made on  the one haridj arid the administrative difficulties pointed out at paragraphs 10 and 11 on the other,any action  is to  be taken in the direction of fixing a  new generalized  rate for unskilled labour in London, or of any concessions to skilled men.    21. A rough estimate of the number of men  in  War  Department  establishments inthfe London area who might be  affected, directly or indirectly, would be    ,    : ,     Men on minimum rate     ...     ...     ...     ...   2,200             Semi-skilled, &amp;c.    ...    ............   5,700 &apos;             Skilled      ......   ..............   2,800Total...............10,700  .&apos;  The number of men employed by the Admiralty in the London area is about 2,000.     22. In order  to  ascertain the  views of  the Government  Departments  mainlyinterested, viz., the Admiralty, Air  Ministry, Office of Works, General Post  Office and ministry of Labour, before submitting the question to the Cabinet, I circulated to them amembrancfum on the above lines.   As regards the  principal  points raised  above, I  think the replies of the Departments may  be fairly summarized as follows :    : - (I)  As to whether the principle of the Fair Wages Resolution (i.e., that Government         :  wages should be based  on those  actually paid in self-supporting industry)           should be maintained or replaced by some other  principle such  as that of           &quot; a living wage,&quot;  there  seems  to be unanimous agreement in favour of   ..     .  maintaining the Resolution.   v ,,(2)  On the question whether in a Government enclosure or department  employing           various trades, the treatment of each trade  should follow exactly the outside           practice of that particular trade,  or whether there should be a generalized           code representing on the average a fair equivalent oE outside  practice for the           employees as a whole, there is &apos;a general preference for the generalized  code.           In Office of Worlds establishments, however (which are in no way comparable           -with Woolwich Arsenal or an Admiralty Dockyard), the rules of each trade are           followed, and in  the  Air  Ministry storekeeping establishment at  Kidbrooke       .    skilled &apos;tradesmen are,  I  believe, paid the outside  trade  rates of  their own           craft, although unskilled men receive the generalized London rate.  .,:  (3)  On -the  question whether an enquiry  should, now ,be  set up,  throughN the           Ministry of  Labour, to revise the existing generalized, rate, for unskilled-:&quot;           labour in London,  the  replies  are  generally in  the negative,  in view.of the
5:;28            abnormal conditions still obtaining in the relative levels of wages in different            occupations, and of the danger that  such an  enquiry  at present, might            result in so large an  increase in the: unskilled  labour rate as  to make  it            impossible to avoid a consequential increase in the ratings of skilled tradesmen!            employed in Government Establishments, which  Would involve  paymeBttoJ            them of more than the outside standard.  The Air Ministry, however, appear            to favour such an enquiry provided that means can be found for avoiding such I-            a-consequential increase.        :                   -     i      - ,./.  \i     23. After carefully re-examining the ground in the light of the opinions expressedby the other Departments,  I have arrived at the following conclusions, which  I  desire torecommend for the approval of the Cabinet:      (1) Skilled rates. -As regards  the  skilled engineering tradesmen, I think that the .wages we pay to this class  are as favourable as those current in the outside engineering industry, and  that no case is  made out for any increase.  In regard to skilled tradesmen:of non-engineering  crafts  (e.g.,  saddlers), some adjustment of rates may be necessary,since these men are at present  (see paragraph 8) paid neither  on an engineering basis :nor  at the rates  of their own trade,  but  this matter can,  I think,  be  dealt withdepartmentally,  if i the  principle that  Woolwich as a whole  should  be treated as anengineering establishment  for the purpose of fixing the wages of all skilled craftsmen is confirmed.     (2) Two minor concessions (which would be applicable alike to skilled and unskilledmen) should be made  in  order  to  conform to the general practice of the engineering industry, viz.  :      (a) Overtime  and Night  Shift. -While we have reduced wages of skilled men to justthe same extent as the Federated  employers, we have so  far maintained our longestablished practices, which differ from those of the trade, as regards overtime and night shift.  I think we should now adopt the trade conditions.   For overtime, this involves(i) letting each day stand by itself,  instead of making a weekly reckoning in  which timelost  on one day cancels overtime  worked on another &quot;in the same week, and  (ii) paying&quot;time and  a  half&quot; for all overtime, instead of  &quot;time and a quarter&quot;  for  the  first two  hours of  any day and &quot;time and  a half&quot; thereafter.  For night shift, it involvespaying &quot; time and a third &quot; for all nightshirt instead of &quot; time and a half &quot; after midnightonly.  There  would be, in a majority  of cases, some balance in favour  of the men.These are concessions of considerable importance  in principle, though  at present theworking of overtime and night shift. is confined to comparatively few individuals.     ( )  Transfer of 7s.  to  basic   rate.-Some time  ago the  engineering  employerstransferred  7s. of the remaining war advance to the  basic rate.   We  have  not  so  farfollowed the trade practice in  this matter, but I think we should  now do so ;  this  would leave the remaining war advance at 10s., as  in the trade.  This concession  also is ofconsiderable importance in principle and would, moreover, add something to gratuity on ,discharge, &amp;c.     (3)  As regards unskilled and semi-skilled men, both in the Factories and the Ordnanceand other Army Departments  at Woolwich and elsewhere in  the London District, it  is(for  the reasons indicated Ubove) too  dangerous to institute  a  fresh enquiry  into the unskilled labour  rate (44s.) ;  but there  is no  doubt that it compares unfavourably withthe rates paid to many large classes in London to-day, and it is also difficult entirely to ignore the fact that since I received the  deputations  last August the cost of living indexhas risen from 169 to 177.     After anxious consideration  I have reached the definite conclusion that some advance in the remuneration of these classes can  no longer be resisted and I  would ask mycolleagues to approve of the grant of the following  temporary increases of wages,.to beissuable under the same conditions (in the case of both time workers and piece workers) asapply to the bonus element of the present wages :-         To men on rates (including  s.  d.    s.   d.              s.  d.           bonus) from    ...    ...  44   0 to 46   0, an increase of 2   0  a  week.                                     46   6 ,, 50   0       ,,       1   6    !  ,,                       .              50   6 ,, 57   6       ,,       1   0      ,,     The cost is estimated at  19,000 a year for the&apos; Ordnance  Factories and   I4j000 ayear  for other  Army Departments.II
     24. 1 have consulted the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secrete^ of State for Air regarding the above proposals.   My first conclusion is, I believe&apos;,&apos; generally concurred in ;&apos;and I,&apos;db ;nbt think there is. any serious opposition  to &quot;the two. minor&quot;- concessions under (2), although the Secretary of State for Air desires to reserve freedom of action as regards the extension.of the engineering, trade overtime conditions to  the storekeeping establishment at Kidbrooke.   It is in regard  to my  proposal under (3) above, that a difference of opinion has emerged.     25.. The proposed  advances to the  unskilled and  semi-skilled-men have the entire support of  the  Air Ministry as well as of the War Office ; but the Admiralty favours the maintenance of the status quo, and, while  not wishing to  stand in the way of the War Office  doing what it considers right or  necessary, feels: bound to  express itsviewt that  a similar  increase would  be  strongly pressed for in all  the dockyards, and  the Treasury, which has also been consulted, strongly resists the proposal not only on its merits, but also because the Chancellor feels that in present circumstances it would be improper for the Government to decide a question of this kind.   As regards the latter point, T cannot see oh  what grounds it  can be held improper  to  decide a  claim which has  been under consideration by the War Office, in consultation with other departments, since as long ago as the autumn of  1922, and as I gave  an undertaking  in November  to the men&apos;s representatives that I would  obtain a decision from the Government immediately after the ejection, I would strongly urge that the question should be settled, one  way or another, without further  delay. ;&apos;:   26. With reference to the view taken by the Admiralty, which of  course employs in the &quot;London  area only a small number of men relatively  to the War Office, I appreciate the  importance  of keeping  in  view the possible  effects  on  the wages of Dockyard employees,  but  I  think it  is relevant  to point out that tHI Admiralty  methods of regulating  wages  in  the  dockyards   are   not  identical   with those   adopted   by this. Department and   by the  Air Ministry,  and  that it occupies a  special position in  relation  to its industrial  employees owing to  a substantial proportion of the latter enjoying the privilege of establishment.   In any  case  it does  not seem to me right that a concession which I hold to be called for on its own merits should be withheld for fear of  hypothetical consequential claims, which should equally,  in  my  opinion,  be dealt with on their own  merits if and when they arise.     27. The Treasury opposition to the proposed advances, so far as it is based on the merits of the case, appears to  rest on two main grounds, (1)  that, Woolwich  being  mainly an engineering establishment, the rates paid there are properly based on those paid in the  outside engineering industry, and that, as regards Pimlico, which is taken as the type of other London establishments, as the employees there have for the past eight years (like those at Woolwich) received the advances and suffered the cuts made in outside engineering rates, this system should be maintained in force;  and (2) that the advances I  suggest would not raise the  unskilled rate to the level of store-keeping labourers  in private employment in the West End of London, and, therefore, could not be logically defended, at any rate as regards  Pimlico, as complying with  the  Fair Wages Resolution ; so  that  the proposed new minimum  rate would be  &quot;a  rate without any foundation and related to no clear- principle.&quot;     28. In reply to the first argument I would urge      (a) That, although Woolwdch may rightly be  regarded as in the main an engineer-&apos;        &apos;:    ing  establishment                  (i) A  large proportion of the  unskilled workers  are engaged on duties                     haAnng no connection whatever with engineering  work,  and                (ii) The  rate paid to unskilled labour there  has at  no time been  an                     engineering rate, although during the war the engineering advances                     were applied to it.    : (b) That the  extension of those advances to such establishments   as Pimlico was            adopted not, in pursuance of any accepted  principle, but largely as a  matter            of administrative  cpnvenience and as  a  readily  available  measure  of  the            increase in cost  of  living,  in some  cases without any  request  from  the            employees.     (c) that the effect on. wages was not necessarily always more advantageous to the men            than the adoption of the outside rates of their own crafts would have been ;            and ,;.   (d) that the adoption of  this method of  wage-regulation by  the  Government as a            temporary  expedient  during the  war  period, and  its  acceptance  by the            employees   at  a  time  when it  was  generally  advantageous  to  them,
            cannot fairly be regarded as having settled the  question for all time,  or as            precluding  them  from reopening it when owing to severe depression in the            engineering industry this method operates upon them with undue severity.&apos;.  ,   29. As regards  the second argument, i.e., the lack of a definite and  logical&apos; basis for&quot;the proposed rates, I think the reply is that, in accordance with  well established practicedating from many years before the war, the minimum rate for Government establishments in London has (as is pointed out in paragraph 6 above) regularly been a  uniform andgeneralized rate fixed after enquiry into the wages of various kinds of unskilled labour,a,nd this principle of a generalized rate is understood to be generally acceptable to the employees.   Thus, the rate for unskilled labour at Pimlico  has at no time been based onon  the  wages obtaining  in  private  store-keeping  establishments  in  London, andthe discrepancy between  those  wages  and the  proposed new rate  will not be in thefuture,  any  more than it has  been in the past, an  indication of a departure from  adefinite and logical basis.   It is true that an enquiry into the present remuneration ofunskilled labour in London, similar  to  those undertaken before the war, might be foundto justify a greater increase than I  now suggest,  but I do not think the adoption of  my proposal can prejudice  the Government  position from  the  point  of  view  of logic andprinciple.     30. I  would  therefore  strongly urge my  colleagues  to authorize me to make  an-announcement to the men&apos;s representatives embodying the concessions set out in (2) and(3) of paragraph 23.  THE  WAR OFFICE,       2nd January, 1924.
