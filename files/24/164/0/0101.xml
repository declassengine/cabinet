THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.secret, P. 100 (W).                      CABINET.                ;  1 3                           War Charges (Validity) Bill.,                Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.                              Milk License Charge.              The question has been raised by the Minister of Agriculture         as  to the inclusion in this Bill of the charges imposed by the         Food Controller on licences under the Milk (Distribution) Order,         1918,- and the Milk Registration (Dealers) Order, 1918, on the         ground that the Bill as introduced by the late Government did         not validate these charges.              In June 1922 the House of Lords gave Judgment against the         Crown on the question of the validity of the charges levied for         milk licences.  On the 19th July, 1922, a motion in the  House         of  Lords Introduced by Lord Strachie that the Government should :         repay the charges levied for milk licences was defeated  by         42  votes to 29 and both Lord Buckmaster and Lord Birkenhead         spoke against the motion.              The late Government, however, decided not to interfere         with the actual judgment of the House of Lords and on the 24th         July, 1922, Sir Arthur Boscawen, the then Minister of Agriculture         stated that effect would be given to a recent judicial decision         of  the House of Lords that the licence fee of 2d per gallon         should be repaid by the Government to milk dealers, while legis-        .lation would be introduced to validate other charges of  a         similar character,  A number of questions have been asked in the         House of Commons from time to time on the subject,  and the         answers given have been to the effect that the Government were         not prepared to repay licence fees,  which had been  charged,   *         until consideration had been given to the far Charges (Validity)         Bill,  then before the House of Commons.   That Bill  as stated         above did not validate  charges for milk licences.
     If the present Bill does not&apos;validate  charges for milklicences it is likely that an amendment will be. moved to validate such charges, so that in any  case  It is probable thata definite line will have to be taken by the Government, andthe question is as to the form in which the Bill should beIntroduced,     The position has substantially changed since the Intro-duction of the Bill by the late Government  owing to  judgmenthaving been obtained last December against  the Government inrespect of a charge made  as a condition of  granting  a licence to transfer a British ship to a foreign flag, and it has accordingly become more difficult than before to justify an exception being made in favour of a charge  in respect of milklicences alone.     In my view the Bill should be introduced in its present form which validates the charges made  in respect of milklicences as well  as all other charges  of a  similar&apos; char act erf.                                                S,W.Board of Trade,      11th February, 1924,
