AGRICULTURAL RETURNS BILL.-          Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.               I desire to re-introduce the Agricultural Returns Bill,     which passed through the House of Lords last session, but made     no progress in the House of Commons owing to the Dissolution     last Novembers               The Bill reproduces in effect, the provisions of     section fifteen of the Corn Production Act, 1917, which was     repealed with the rest of that Act as the powers were expressly     stated to be given &quot;!in order to obtain such information as is     necessary for the purpose of the proper exercise by the Board     of their powers under this Act&quot;,     -         &apos;        &apos; &apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;                                           -    I               The desired returns have for many years been obtained     without compulsion, but there are in each year a few persons who    ,decline to make returns.  To secure complete statistics a power     to deal with such persons is desired and this proposal is     approved by the principal bodies representing agricultural     opinion.  Following the precedent of the Corn Production Act the     Mil provides for the form of return being settled by regulations     laid before Parliament.               in less the Committee considers that adherence to this     precedent is desirable I should prefer to omit sub-section (i7)     dealing with this point.               A copy of the Bill, which should provo non-controversial.     is attached.                                        B.B.  ;Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,            5th February, 1924 *
