DOOTOfflHT^IS  THE PROPERTY  OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.0 ii i72 (24)                CABINET.            (Home Affaire  Committee).          CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade..      It  is  suggested that  this  Bill should be proceeded with  as  a matter  of  urgency0      Its object is to  give statutory effect to an  agreementbetween  shipowners and other parties on  the question  of  the incidence of liability for Iocs  or  damage  to goods  carriedon ships.   Its early  introduction  is being strongly pressed by the ship---owning, shipping, banking,  and under-writing interests concerned, and no  opposition is anticipatedfrom  any quarter.    It has been approved in practicallyits present form by  a  Joint Committee of both Houses  ofParliament held last year under the  chairmanship of thelate Lord Sterndale.   It has been recommended by theImperial Economic Conference of last year as a  basis for legislation throughout the Empire.   There is good reason tobelieve that if it is  adopted in this country it will beadopted without delay  in many other  countries,  and will eventually be adopted by every one of the important MaritimeNations for application to International Shipping.     The Bill sooks to give effect to an agreed code of Rules -?which have boen drawn up to settle a dispute which, haslasted since about 1880.  Shippers have represented fromtime to time that by means of Clauses in Bills of Ladingshipowners have exempted themselves from certain liabilities.which they ought reasonably to undertake.  The matter  wasconsidered by the Imperial- Shipping Committee which was
                                                        i 0 ci ti set up  by  the  Imperial War  Conference,  1918,  and  contains representatives  of this  country,  the  Dominions  and Colonies, and that Committee in a  report published in February,  1921, recommended uniform legislation throughout  the  Empire  on the basis of the Canadian Water Carriage  of  Goods Act,  1910, subject to certain further  provisions.     Boforo effect could bo given to  these  recommendations a set of rules had been adopted at  the  Hague  at an International Conference of representatives of  shipowners, shippers., bankers,- underwriters and other interests.  These rules  known as theHague Rules were not entirely in  conformity with the recommendations of the Imperial Shipping Committee, but theywere subsequently amended by agreement between  the interested parties to conform substantially  to the recommendations ofthe Committee.     These rules with certain alterations were recommended by the delegates at the Brussels Maritime international conference of October,  1922, at whioh His Majesty1s Governmentwas represented, for adoption as  the basis  of a Convention,This basis formed the schedule to a Bill which was introduced into the House  of Lords last yaar.  The Bill was consideredby a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament preside over by tho late Lord Storndale which heard representativesof all parties  concerned, and it emerged from that Conmiitt.eewith some slight alterations,  and was passed by the Lords. It was awaiting its readings in the House of Commons when parliament was  dissolved..     The Draft  Convention was put into final fornf in Ootober   ., last by a Committee of the Brussels International Maritime Conference set up for that purpose.   A few minor alterationswere made which brought it into line with the recommendations of the Sterndale Committee.  The rules scheduled to the present Bill are those contained in the Draft Convention
Board of Trade.    6th February,  1924.which is now av/waiting signature,     A draft of the Bill is attached.  A few further amendments to the Bill are being discussed between Parliamentary Counseland a Drafting Committee representative of business interests.     Much controversy has arisen over this question of theliability of shipowners.  It is mainly a matter for ship-owners and shippers to settle among themselves and as theyhave arrived at substantial agreement, it is desirable thatlegal validity should be given to tho agreement to avoid further dispute, and also to secure the advantages in inter-national commerce of uniform law throughout the world.     It would be well for this country to take the lead inputting on its Statute Book without delay the requisitelegislation, and resolutions from a number of importantcommercial bodies have been received urging that the Billshould be made law at the earliest possible datee  It shouldhave an easy passage, and could, if desired,  be introduced,as was the case last session;  in the Lordsc          \     The following questions by Captain Wedgwood Benn andMr, Rathbone (the Liberal Member for the Wavertree Division of liverpool) stand in the House  of Commons Order paper for answer on-February 12th;     *1. Captain Wedgwood Benn, - To ask the  President of the          Board of Trade whether it is intended to reintroduce          the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill which was reported          on by a Select Committee of both  Houses in July last;          and whether, if this is the case, facilities will be          given for its rapid passage into Law,     *3. Mr. Rathbone, - To ask the President of the Board of          Trade whether he will, at an early  date, reintroduoe          the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill which, but for          the dissolution last November, would, as an agreed          measure, already be on the statute  book,  *                                            S.W,
