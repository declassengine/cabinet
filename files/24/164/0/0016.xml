114(This  dooument  is  the  property of His  Britannia-MSjestyrs  Government)  &apos; MTMOBAEDUM BY  THE  FIRST  LORD Off THP ADMIRALTY.          If the increases &quot;proposed &quot;by the Secretary ofState for V/ar were granted, they would be extended almostautomatically to nearly 13900 Admiralty employeos in theLondon Area, who at  present receive 59s/- a week or less(59s/- being the Admiralty equivalent of the War Officerate of 57s/6d)0  Tho annual cost would be just over  6,000.          If the increases&apos;were to end here, they-wouldnot bo serious.  But the Board of Admiralty are convincedthat they would not  end here, and that if granted, theywould extend first from London to the Provinces,-then fromsemi-skilled employees to meohanios, and would before long lead to claims  for still larger advances which itwould be harder to resist.          First, it  must be rememberer that the provincialwage-rates of Admiralty industrial employeos are more closely related to the London rates than are those of i;&quot;&amp;rOffice and Air Ministry employees.   In the Admiralty servioathe London rates are simply the* Dockyard weekly rates plus;3s/-.  This 3s/- is  accounted for by the differenoo  in thecost of living between London and the Dockyards.  It oannotwith any show of reason be made 4s/-, 4s/6d or 5s/-, nor can the Admiralty justify,  on tho principles of wageregulation hitherto adopted,  the grant of special bonusesto their London employees.          If then these increases extend, to the Dockyardsand the other Industrial Lstabliohmonts controlled by the                                               Admiralty..,.16 (24)0 A B I HE T.WAPrS OP VAR DEPARTMENT VOREME^nf THE LONDON             7&quot;AREA-,       &apos;&quot;&quot;
Admiralty,  over  20,000 men  of  the  Labourer and  SkilledLabourer classes Till be affected, and the annual cost will be increased from  6.000  to over  74,000-          Those  figures again  arc based on the assumptionthat the increases v.&apos;ill not extend to mechanics.  But therates of pay of  the Dockyard Labourers, Skilled Labourersand Mechanics are oo Closely related that: it is almost impossible  to limit an increase of pay, however small, toany claso.          Ordinary Labourers receive from 24s/- to 26s/-a week, or  with bonus, 41s/.- to 43s/,          She- lower class of Skilloc Labourers rcocives27s/- to 30s/-, or with bonus, 44s/- to. 47s/-, u        A higher class of Skillet&quot;. Labourers receives31s/- to 37s/-, or with bonus, 48s/- to 54s/-,          Tho highest grade of Skilled Labourers (Caulkers,Riveters and Others) proceed up to 39s/- for with bonus56s/:-) 0          The lowest paid class of Mechanics (painters)receive exactly the sane as the highest grade of SkilledLabourerso  Joiners, Bricklayers and Plumbers receiveonly Is/- a week more,  and the great body of Mechanicsonly 2s/- more, or 58s/- a week including bonus.          But this is not all,  A oertain proportion ofthe workmen aro established (i0e, pensionable]  and reoeiveon this account rates of pay sli&amp;htly lower than thosequoted.  Thus an Established painter gats 37s/-, an established Joiner 38s/- and an Established Shipwright39s/-.  The ratio of the Mechanics wages to labourers1wages is already less than was over the  oase before  theWar, and to grant a preferential increase in the amountof the bonus- to Labourers would further  worsen the  relative position of the Mechanics and intensify  their claims for                                               increases,,,
 increases  in wages.   If  the  increases  are  restricted to men receiving not more than  39s/-  (basic),  some  classes of Mechanics will share  irl them; if  the  limit! is  fixed at 37s/- some  classes of labourers \;ill not share in them, and in either case the excluded classes  vill  be able to make a strong claim to share  the benefits.  Once  such a claim is alloved the  number  of. men affected, will  rise to over 50,000 and the cost to  over  150,000          lor will this  be the end.  Hitherto Dockyard wages- have been related  to those paid  in the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades,  The Admiralty have  successfully resisted claims to base  wag.es  of a section  of their employees  (e0g, men in the building trades) on wages paid in similar trades outside, or  to raise the  general standard to that current in trades unconnected  with  shipbuilding oir engineering or to give increases on oost-of-living grounds. In November 19,82, a claim for a general increase  of 12s/- a week on cost^of-living grounds was referred to arbitration and refused by the Industrial Court, not because it wasunjustified on cost-of-living grounds,  but  because the Admiralty were paying a  fair wage judged by commercial standards.          But once a Department goes beyond the fair wages standard, because the fair wage is not a &quot;living wage&quot;, it cannot stop short  of paying, a &quot;living wage&quot;. And if the rates already paid by the Admiralty and War Office do not provide a &quot;living wage&quot;  for the grades concerned, the incicases nov proposed will not bring them up to this level.What that level may.be is a matter of debate - for labourers it may be. anything, up to 50s/- &amp; week;  for Mechanics 70s/-.What the increases v&apos;ill  do will be to make  a &quot;living wage&quot;                                             inevitable.,
inevitable, give rise to claims involving sums much larger than anything mentioned in this paper and introduce anentirely new system of wage-regulation into the publicService.          So far as the other Recommendations are concerned,I concur with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Thetransfer of part of the existing: bonus to the basiG rate would not be of unmixed benefit to the Established employeosof the Admiralty, as a deduction would have to be made onaccount of establishment privileges,-  Thus an EstablishedShipwright who at present receives 39s/- plus 17/s- bonusv&apos;ould receive not 46s/- plus 10b/- bonus, but 45s/6d plus10s/-.  This has been pointed out to representatives ofAdmiralty workmen who have therefore ceased to press forthe concession,                   *                    (Sgd) L.S. AMTRY.Admiralty,S.W.1.   9th January 1923.
