IThis Document  is the Property  of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government. 1SECRET.CP. 93/24.CABINET.THE USE OF AIRCRAFT IN IRAQ IN SUPPORT OF THE CIVIL POWER.              MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.    I CIRCULATE herewith an extract from a letter received from Air-marshal sir John Salmond, the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq.    In view of the very misleading  articles which have recently appeared in the-press, I think  my colleagues will be  interested in this statement of the principles which govern the use of aircraft in Iraq in support of  the Civil Power.                                                          C.  B.  T,                                                  Secretary of State for Air.    Air Ministry, February 2, 1924.    &quot;. .  . .  The High Commissioner decides on his line of policy and attempts to getthis carried out through the medium of the Iraq Government and its officials.  As timegoes on and  the country becomes more settled and the Government more stable, thethe Iraq Cabinet assumes a policy of its own.  This policy the High Commissionerchecks or encourages as he sees fit it may be that at times the Government pqliey is contrary to his Excellency&apos;s.  Under such circumstances he decides  whether or notto allow it to continue, and in cases where the Government are difficult he: usuallyfinds some modus operandi which is satisfactory to both parties.      The executive administration of  what may be termed  this combined policyoccasionally is resented by one or other sections or tribes and brings in its train opendefiance to Government.   In  by far the greater  majority of cases  this defiance is dealt with by Police action or  negotiation.  When these fail or it is anticipated thatPolice action is too dangerous to undertake, appeal to Air Headquarters is made asa last  resort.    &quot;  I then have to decide the best means of assisting the Government  to procureobedience to  its orders.    &quot;  Where I consider it tactically suitable, having regard to their numbers and state of efficiency, I make use of the Iraq Army with or without air co-operation.My aim, as time goes on, being to give the Iraq  Army where practicable a graduallyincreasing share  in  military control, and thus enable it to find its feet.  I may on another occasion use Levies or Mounted Police with air assistance, or air action alone,or the air mainly, followed up by action by one or other of the above local  ground forces.  Again, where conditions have been suitable, Armoured Cars,  in co-operationwith local forces, have been used and have restored without bloodshed a-situationwhich must otherwise  have resulted in a serious disturbance with its attendant  lossof life.                                 .   ; ; &quot;                           &quot;    &quot; These  are  the means at my disposal.   No two outbreaks as yet  have beenexactly similar, and each one  has to be  carefully examined from its various  aspectsbefore the best means  of dealing with it is finally decided.   A great deal depends upon this careful examination of the,problem. .  1    &quot; No action is ever taken except at the request of the British Civilian adviser on the spot,  and after this request has been duly weighed by $he Minister of  theInterior and his British Adviser and by the High Commissioner.    &quot; Even after a request has passed this three-fold scrutiny, I have on  more thanone occasion as the  High Commissioners chief Military Adviser opposed it on themilitary grounds that I did.not consider that the offensive action which I had been      [11195]
asked to take would lead to the result desired; and his Excellency has always acceded to such advice on the acknowledged basis that I am more perfectly acquainted withthe effects it may be expected to achieve.    &quot; Again, in thus scrutinising the request of a British Adviser for action in hisarea, the fullest use is made of the very rapid means of transportation which aircraftaffords.  Advisers from the districts and  my own local Intelligence Officers arewhenever it  is desired, brought  by  air  for  personal  consultation with the HighCommissioner or myself, and it is beyond doubt that the closest touch is kept by trieCentral Government and its Advisers,  and by the High Commissioner  and myself,with local conditions as they really are.  I feel very sure that no action is precipitate&apos;,and that before it is finally agreed to the pros and cons are thoroughly thrashed out.    &quot; I should  add here that  both  the  High Commissioner  and the Minister ofInterior have always placed the fullest information at my disposal as to the previoussteps  which have been  taken  by them before a resort  to force has been considered necessary, and have afforded me the most complete facilities for  personal discussionwith their local  officials and staff, so that I have been  on each occasion able to basethe measures to be taken upon a very close acquaintance with the particular problemover which military assistance has been sought.    &quot;I am  confident as a result of these safeguards that the action taken in eachcase has  been that best calculated to lead to the result required and the minimumaction which it would have been safe to employ.    . &quot; An example  of a recent operation which it was  decided to undertake will show  how this scrutiny works in practice.   The  Iraqi Governor of  a Liwa on theEuphrates and his British Administrative Inspector or Adviser  had decided that a,certain district, most inaccessible by reason of its very close intersection by waterchannels and because of the entire absence of any tracks suitable for wheels or evenmoderately convenient  for pack animals, was definitely out of hand and could notbe brought under administration by peaceful methods.  It is a district which has remained untouched by, and intolerant of, Government ever since the insurrectionof 1920 and which, before our advent,  had always proved a very troublesome thornin the Turkish side.   &apos; &quot; The Government decided that the present settled state of the rest of that area,and the general progress made in the establishment of stable administration generallythroughout  Iraq, now  made it at once justifiable and necessary to call upon  thisturbulent district to accept Government administration, and thus come into line withits neighbours and the rest of the country.    &quot; At the same time, all authorities  concerned were quite definite that in  this district  force would  be required before  the  district would accept government authority&quot;.    &quot; The problem- was submitted by the local British Adviser to the  Ministry ofInterior,  and, after scrutiny there,  was forwarded  for  consideration to the HighCommissioner.  As  a result, the High Commissioner asked  Air  Headquarters toprepare such measures as would be suitable for dealing with this  district if it should prove  resolute  in defiance.   The High Commissioner  himself proceeded to theGovernment Headquarters concerned and there conferred with the  officials.   special service Officers with a knowledge of that part of the country made an extended tourof the district affected, and these, together with the Iraqi  Governor  of  the district,his British Adviser, the local Commandant of Police and the British Police Inspectorfor the area, were flown up to Baghdad for consultation with myself.    &quot; My own concern was the &apos; military &apos; problem how,  if action should ultimately be  required, that action should be devised,  so as to  be  the most effective in itself in producing the political result desired by the Government and at the  same  time theminimum which would lead to that result.    &quot; I had made a reconnaissance by air from a low altitude and was acquainted withthe nature  of the,country affected,  and could gauge,  from my acquaintance with similar conditions&apos;1 with which I was familiar elsewhere in Iraq, both the form and amount of  the  resistance^ which  was  likely  to be  made  and the course which theoperations would be likely to  take.     &quot; Some four conferences in all were held with the various local authorities I havenamed above and their local knowledge  and contentions were thoroughly sifted. AndI am quite sure that the action which I finally decided should be  taken, if force were required, was the one best adapted to this particular problem and at the same timethe course likely to entail the least severity in the final attainment of the object I hadto secure.
    &quot;Of course, there cannot always.be time to go so thoroughly as this into thedetails of every outbreak.  Rapid action by Government, to give waverers the rightlead, and show that defiance will not be tolerated, is sometimes essential, and is then,beyond all argument, the most merciful course to take.   To temporise is only tohave in  the end a larger disturbance, and a  more stubborn one,  to quell.   This iswhere, because of its rapidity, air action is  so much more humane than a column.The great power, however, with which air action can be applied is one to which I amfully alive^ and the prevention of its misuse  is a constant object of watchfulness onour part.    &quot; In no case has air action been employed in which it would not otherwise  havebeen necessary,  and sooner rather than later, with this inflammable people, to  send out a column  to restore the situation.  And there can be no two opinions at all that air action rapidh/ taken at the focus of trouble,  and before it has chance to spread,and discriminating in its incidence,  is in every way  a less severe and yet a more powerful corrective than the visit of a column of troops to a then extended area of trouble,  with  its inevitable accompaniment of destruction and tribal retaliation,  and casualties to both sides and long-remaining misery in the area visited.    &apos;&apos; In many  cases the despatch of aircraft to an aerodrome in the vicinity of thedisturbed district of a demonstration flight, with or without the dropping of warningleaflets,  has been sufficient to produce the necessary effect.   And this effect has been produced without  bloodshed  where in similar circumstances ground forces wouldbeyond doubt have had to take offensive action.   And I may say here that experience has shown that offensive action by ground forces tends to rally neighbouring tribes inretaliation and thus to magnify the trouble, whereas air forces tend to avert offensive action by the moral effect of their presence;  or, if they  do have to take action, tendto restrict the outbreak closely and to prevent other tribes rallying to the originaloffender.    &quot; It is a commonplace here that aircraft achieve their result by their effect on&apos; moral,&apos; and by the material damage they do, and by the interference they cause tothe daily routine of life and not through the infliction of casualties.    &quot; The casualties inflicted have been most remarkably small.   A tribe that is out for trouble is well aware when the  patience of Government  has reached  breakingpoint;  and negotiations inevitably end in what is in  effect, an ultimatum  in  some form or other.  Complete surprise is impossible, and the real weight of air actionlies in the daily interruption of normal life which it can inflict, if necessary for an indefinite period, while offering negligible chances of loot or of hitting back.....&quot;
