The King&apos;s  Speech  on the Opening of Parliament.                    JAJUAKY 15,  1924.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS  OP THE HOUSE OP COMMONS,    MY relations with Foreign Powers continue to  be  friendly.  I am glad to beable to record  definite progress in the solution of questions which have hithertoblocked the pathway of  mutual understanding and have retarded the recovery ofthe world.    The Reparation  Commission has  set up two Committees, on which Expertsfrom the United States of  America will co-operate with  others from Great Britain,Prance, Italy  and Belgium in examining the  very serious  financial questions involved in the position  of Germany.    The future status of the Tangier zone of Morocco, which has been a long-standing  source  of trouble, has been the subject of an Agreement between the delegates of the Powers principally concerned, which provides  for the creation  ofan international  regime and for the promotion of communications and trade.    A  Bill will  be introduced to give effect to the Lausanne Treaty with Turkey.As  soon  as it has  been passed, the  Treaty will be ratified,  and a new  era  of peaceful relations with Turkey will open.    My Ministers, in common with  the Dominion representatives, have been anxious to remove the  difficulty with regard to the illicit importation  of liquorinto the United States, and have made proposals for an agreement which is  on the eve of conclusion, and which should further  strengthen  the  happy relationsprevailing between the two countries and peoples.    It  will continue to be My object to  support by every means in My power the steady growth in influence of the League of  Nations.    The  recent  series  of murders  on  the North-West Frontier  of  India  bycriminals who  have sought refuge in Afghan territory or are Afghan subjects, has caused Me much concern.   My Government have made vigorous representations to the  Government  of His Majesty  The  Amir,  and I earnestly trust that these persons will be  punished,  and more  satisfactory relations  on  the frontier  beestablished, at a very early date.    The recent Imperial Conferences marked a very definite progress in Imperialco-operation.   More  particularly was it found possible, without  departure fromthe existing fiscal system in this country, to meet the wishes of the Dominionsby a substantial  extension of the principle of Imperial Preference established bythe Conference of 1917  and in  force since 1919.  Proposals to give effect  to theconclusions of  both Conferences will be submitted to you.    I welcome  the  opportunity that will be  afforded  by  the British  EmpireExhibition to  increase the knowledge of  the varied  resources of  My Empire andto stimulate inter-Imperial trade.MEMBERS  OP THE HOUSE OP COMMONS,    Estimates for the public services will be laid before you.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OP THE HOUSE  OF COMMONS,    While I am  glad to note that the schemes for providing employment now inoperation  have had  an  appreciable  effect during the last year in  reducing thenumbers of those actually  unemployed,  the number still unable to find workcauses Me the gravest  concern.  My, Ministers  recently laid before the countryproposals  which, in their judgment, would  have  contributed materially to  asolution of this  problem by.affording to industry a greater measure of security inthe home  market and an improved outlet for its  products in My Dominionsoverseas  and  in foreign countries;  but these proposals were not  accepted  by thecountry.      [11092]
    In these  circumstances  your assent will be invited  to an  extension  andamendment of the Trade Facilities and Export Credit Schemes, to the proposal of the Imperial Economic Conference for expediting and assisting the execution ofcertain public enterprises throughout the Empire by the grant of financial aid from public funds, and to an extension of the contributions towards the cost ofPublic Utility Works,  whether undertaken by local authorities or promoted by statutory and private corporations.    You will  also  be asked  to  assist in providing work in the  shipbuilding industry  by  the  immediate  construction  of cruisers  and  auxiliary craft in anticipation of  the Naval Programme.    Steps will be taken to develop the existing system of Juvenile UnemploymentCentres and to provide increased facilities for general and technical education.    The  condition of agriculture  remains  a source of  serious anxiety.   my ministers  propose to  summon a conference representative of all those  interestedin agriculture, and of the various political parties, with the object of arriving atan agreed policy, by which the  acreage of arable land  may be maintained,  and regular employment at an adequate wage secured for the agricultural worker.    Bills will be introduced to improve the position of pre-war pensioners, and todeal with the discouragement of thrift involved in the present means limitation tothe grant of Old Age Pensions.    You will  be  asked to  develop  the probationary  system of  dealing  withoffenders.   Bills will be introduced to amend and consolidate the Factory  and workshops Acts, to legitimize children born  out  of wedlock whose -parents  havesubsequently  married,  and  to  amend  the  law relating  to separation   andmaintenance orders.    Under the Housing Act of last  session  My Ministers have  approved theerection of a large number of  houses, both by Local Authorities  and by privateenterprise. The Local Authorities are being approached with a view  to increasedactivity under those sections of the Act which enable  the  working population tobecome the owners of their homes.    Measures  will be  laid before you to complete Land Purchase  in NorthernIreland, and  to guarantee the  principal and interest of  bonds issued  by theGovernment of the Irish Free State under the Land Act  recently passed in that dominion.    The obligation to alleviate  hardship  caused by the former disturbances inIreland is one which is recognised by My Government  and will continue to engagetheir active attention.    Proposals will be  submitted  to you  for the expansion of the Royal Air Forcein connection with Home Defence.    Preparations have also been made for measures dealing with the property and endowments of the Church of Scotland, the improvement of the road traffic ofLondon, for the  reform of the system of valuation and rating in England  andWales, and of rating  in Scotland, for the improvement of  the administration ofcivil and  criminal justice, for making valid  certain charges  imposed during thewar, for the ascertainment of  costs and profits in connection with the distributionof milk.    And  I pray  that the  blessing  of  Almighty God  may rest upon  yourdeliberations.
