? Age &amp; ? Limits

5. The Committee are impressed with the importance of maintaining the Statutory conditions as to age and means limits, any concessions in respect of which would greatly increase the cost to the Exchequer. Accordingly the Committee do not recommend any change in these matters, subject, however, in the case of the means limits, to reconsideration in the event of any substantial alterations which the Cabinet may decide to make in the case of the means limits under the Old Age Pensions Scheme.



? Residents ?thin the British Isles.

6. The removal of the condition that in order to receive the benefits of the 1920 Act a pensioner must reside within the British Isles is estimated to cost the Exchequer approximately Â£60,000 per annum. The condition in question has been the subject of considerable criticism and its removal presents no serious administrative difficulties, on the whole, the Committee feel that a concession in this matter is logically defensible and would materially improve the prospects of the Bill.



Local Authority Pensioners.

7. While in no way dissenting from the conclusions contained in Para. 14 of the Report of the Pre-War pensions Committee (C.P.278 (23), the Committee consider that the Bill and the terms of the Financial Resolution should be so drawn as not to preclude the introduction of an amendment the effect of which would be to oblige Local Authorities to grant the benefits of the Pensions Increase legislation to their own pre-war pensioners.



HIGH PENSIONERS.

8. The Committee see no reason why the Cabinet should reconsider the decision taken at their Meeting on the 27th June, 1923, Cabinet 33 (23) Concl. 1 (b), respecting certain Irish pre-war pensioners.
