IV.  MESSAGE TO  JAPAN.   It was also resolved at the first meeting of the Conference to send the following message of sympathy to Japan:          &quot; The Prime Ministers and  Representatives of Great Britain,    the  British Dominions and India,  assembled at the  Imperial    Conference,  desire  at their  opening session to send to their old    and faithful ally, Japan, an  expression of their  profound sym-    pathy in the terrible calamity by which she  has  been assailed;    their admiration of the patriotic energy and unconquerable spirit    with which the Japanese nation have met the blow;  and their    confident expectation that Japan will rapidly recover from a    shock that  might have overwhelmed any less courageous  people    and will pursue, undismayed, the great part that  she is destined    to fill in the social and economic progress of the world.&quot;   In reply  to  this message a note was received from the japanese ambassador  in  London.  This  note,  which was  read aloud by thePrime Minister of Great Britain at the meeting on the 11th October,was as follows :    .         &quot; Under instructions from the Japanese Premier, I have the    honour to request Your Lordship to convey to the Right Honour-    able Stanley Baldwin, Prime Minister, and his eminent colleagues    ou the Imperial Conference, the Japanese Premiers sincere  thanks    for the touching message of sympathy in the calamity which haspractice on previous occasions, was to send a message of greeting toTheir Majesties the King and Queen.   The words of this message were :          &quot;The Prime Ministers and  other Representatives of the    British  Empire assembled  in Conference, at their first meeting    and as  their first official act,  desire to express their respectful    greetings and fidelity to the King,  and fervently hope that His    Majesty  and Her Majesty  the  Queen  may  be long spared to    strengthen those ties of love and devotion which unite the peoples    of the British Commonwealth.&quot;   His Majesty&apos;s gracious reply  was read aloud by the Prime Ministerof Great Britain at the meeting on  October 5th  and was in  thefollowing terms :-         &quot; I  sincerely  thank the Prime Ministers  and other Repre-    sentatives of the  British  Empire  for the generous terms of the    message  which they have  addressed to  the Queen  and myself    on&apos; the occasion  of the opening of the Imperial Conference.  I    sincerely trust. that their deliberations will lead to a solution    of those  many and grave problems the settlement of which is so    essential to the future welfare and prosperity of the Commonwealth    of the British Nations.

befallen Japan.   Count Yamamoto desires to assure Mr. Baldwinthat the manifestation of cordial  sentiment coming as it did sopromptly from the representative statesmen of the British Empire,the old and never failing ally of  Japan, has deeply moved theJapanese nation in their great distress and will give them encourage-ment and  reassurance in taking up the tremendous task of re-construction.                                          , :                                    I have, etc.,                                              HAYASHI.&quot;V.-DEATH OP  MR. BONAR  LAW.  The Rt. Hon. A. Bonar Law,  Prime Minister of Great Britain m October 24th,  1922, to May 21st, 1923, died on October 31st. ne of his first  acts on assuming office had been to have a message f invitation sent to the Dominions and India, which resulted in thelalling  of  the Imperial  Conference  and of the  Imperial  EconomicWerence this year.  The following resolution was passed by the  Conference at its meet-Big on the afternoon of October 31st:        &quot; The Members of the Imperial Conference have learnt  with   the most profound regret of the death of the Rt. Hon. Andrew   Bonar Law, at whose invitation,  issued  on his  assuming office   last year, the present Conference is now  meeting.       &quot; They desire to express to the members of the late Prime   Ministers family  their deep sympathy in the irreparable  loss   which they  and the Empire have sustained by his death.&quot;VI. PUBLICITY.  The Conference gave special attention to the question of publicity for its proceedings.  There was general agreement that  at meetingstf this nature,  where questions of high policy and of the greatestconsequence to  all parts of the British Commonwealth are surveyedind dealt with,  it, was of the first importance that the representativespresent should feel able to speak among themselves with the utmostfreedom and in  a spirit of complete confidence.  Hence,  it was con-sidered essential that nothing should be published without the approvalof the Conference as a whole and under its directions.  At the same time it was felt that the proceedings of the ConferenceTOuld cause wide interest among  the peoples of the  countries repre-sented, and consequently that, as opportunity offered,  information regarding its deliberations should  be made public.  It was decided to  place the general arrangements as.to publicity in charge of a  British Minister, and, at  the unanimous  wish of theConference, the Chancellor of  the  Duchy of Lancaster, Mr. J. C. C.Davidson, OH., C.B., M.P., was asked to be present at the meetings and to undertake  the  necessary work.
   This procedure, though of an experimental character, turned out to be of much value and at the conclusion of the meetings the Conferenceexpressed to Mr.  Davidson its great indebtedness for his  valuablehelp.   A discussion also took place, at the instance of the Prime Minister ofCanada, as to the desire of the Parliaments of the various parts of theEmpire to be afforded the fullest information possible on all matters concerning which  negotiations were  going on, or discussions  takingplace,  between the various Governments.  It was felt that  as many as possible of the communications passing ought to be made  availablefor the use of the Parliaments, and a general understanding was reached as to the principles which should govern the publication of correspond-ence between the Governments.VII.-COLONIES,  PROTECTORATES AND MANDATED                   TERRITORIES.    The Secretary of State for the Colonies gave to the Conference, on October 3rd, a comprehensive review, subsequently published*, of the situation in the Colonies, Protectorates, and Mandated Territories.   . A general discussion followed on various aspects of policy in regard to the development of the Colonial Empire and the Mandated Terri- tories, and great stress was laid by the representatives of the Dominions and India on the economic importance of these parts of the world and, in particular, on the value to the Empire as a whole of the great tropical territories in East and West Africa and in  Eastern Asia.     One question touched on was the recent arrangement concluded with  the Belgian Government  for  the rectification of  the  Ruanda Boundary, and it was made.clear that-this rectification still left avail- able a strip of the British mandated territory of Tanganyika west of . Lake Victoria, which could be utilised for the construction of a line north and south.     The Prime Minister of Newfoundland expressed his interest in the researches about to be undertaken in the Antarctic by the late Captain Scottfs ship &quot; Discovery.&quot;   It had already  been arranged that any information obtained from these researches should  be made available : to the Government of the  Union of South  Africa,  and the  Duke of Devonshire undertook  that the information should be supplied also to the Newfoundland Government.     It should be added that the further developments in the Middle  East, and particularly in Palestine, which occurred  during the sittings&apos;  of the Conference, were placed before it.     The Conference took note of these developments.VIII. FOREIGN RELATIONS.    The discussions on foreign relations were commenced on October 5th&apos; by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who gave to the Confer-                   * See Appendix II in Cmd. 1988.
ence a review of the general situation in every part of the world, and.the most  frank  exposition,  first, of the  main  problems which haveconfronted the Empire during the last two yeara, and, secondly, of thosewhich seem most likely to arise in the near future.   The greater part of what Lord Curzon said was  necessarily of a confidential character, since it was his object to supplement the writtenand telegraphic communications of the past two years  by giving orallyto the Eepresentatives of the Dominions and India the inner history ofthe period, but it was thought advisable that extracts from those partsof his  speech  which related to subjects  of  immediate  interest  and importance,  viz., the situation in  connection with  the Reparationsproblem and the Turkish Treaty, should be published forthwith.*   This was a  departure  from  the practice  at previous imperial conferences, when statements made by the Foreign Secretary have been regarded as confidential throughout.   Lord Curzon&apos;?  review was followed by a general discussion onforeign relations, in which Lord Robert Cecil  as British representative on the Council of the League  of Nations,  all&apos;the Dominion  PrimeMinisters present, the Vice-president of the Executive Council  of theIrish Free  State and the three members of the Indian  delegation, took part.f   Frequent and detailed examination was given, not only to the main features of the international situation,  but to the different aspects ofthat situation as they developed from day to day.   Nor did the ImperialConference terminate its sittings until each subject had been carefullyexplored and a common understanding reached upon the main heads offoreign policy.   It was  while  the Conference was sitting that the President  of theUnited States  renewed the offer of the United States Governmentto take part in an international conference or enquiry to investigate the European Reparations  problem, and to report upon the capacityof Germany to make the payments to which she is pledged.  TheConference cordially  welcomed,  and decided  to  take  immediateadvantage of, this overture ;  and communications were at once enteredinto with the Allied Powers to obtain their co-operation.              ,   The Conference, after careful consideration of the policy which hasbeen pursued, was of the opinion that the European  situation  couldonly  be lifted  on  to the plane  of  a possible settlement by the co-operation of the  United States of America, and that, if the scheme ofcommon enquiry  to be followed by common action were to break down,the results would be inimical both to the peace  and to the economic recovery of the world.   It felt that in such an event it would be  desirable for the BritishGovernment to consider very carefully the alternative of summoninga Conference itself in order to examine the financial and the economic problem in its widest aspect.   * See Appendix III in Cmd. 1988.  .   t For speeches on the work of  the League of Nations see Appendix IV in cmd.  1988.                                                   &apos;
   The Conference regarded any policy which would result in breaking up the unity of the German  State, as inconsistent  with the treaty obligations  entered  into both  by Germany and the  Powers, and asincompatible with the future discharge by Germany of her necessaryobligations.  The strongest representations  on this  subject  were accordingly made to the Allied Governments.   The Conference considered the situation in the Near and middle east and, recorded its satisfaction at the&apos; conclusion of peace betweenthe Allies and Turkey.   An end had thus been brought to a period of acute political tension,  of military anxiety and financial strain in theeastern parts of Europe ; and  more particularly had great relief beengiven to the sentiments of  the Moslem subjects of the British thronein all parts of the world.   Another of the subjects that engaged the attention of the conference was  that of Egypt.   The Conference was  glad to recognise the  greatadvance that has been made  during  the  last two  years towards apacific  settlement of this  complex problem,  which  will safeguardimportant communications between several parts of the Empire.   The Conference, so much of whose time had been occupied two yearsago  with  the question  of the  renewal or termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and with the future regulation of the Pacific, noted with satisfaction the results of  the Washington Conference, which had added  immensely to the  security  of  the world without disturbingthe intimate, relations that have for so long existed between the Empireand its former Ally.   It recognised with  satisfaction  the progressive fulfilment of theobligations incurred under the Washington Treaties &apos;;&apos; it registered theconfident  belief that the future relations between the governments and peoples of the British Empire and Japan will be not less sincere andcordial than when the British and Japanese Governments were bound by written conventions ; and it recorded its profound  sympathy withthe Japanese Government and people in the terrible catastrophe whiohhas recently befallen them.         . .   During the session of the Conference, the question of tho regulationof the liquor traffic off the American coasts and of the measures to be taken  to avoid a serious conflict either of public opinion or of officialaction was seriously debated.  The Conference arrived at the conclusionthat, while affirming  and safeguarding as a cardinal feature of British.policy  the principle  of the three mile limit, it was yet both desirable and  practicable  to meet the American request for an extension of theright of search beyond this limit for the above purpose, and negotiations were at once opened  with the United States Government for the con-elusion  of an experimental agreement with this object in view.   Finally the  Conference, after listening to a detailed expositionof the  work of the League of Nations during the past  two years, andmore particularly of  the recent sitting of the Council and the assembly at Geneva, placed on record its emphatic  approval of the action that had been taken by, and the support  that had been given to, the repre-sentatives of the British Empire  on the latter occasion.  There was-full accord that the  League should  be  given the unabated support of
 all the British members  of the League as a valuable mstrumeni of international peace, and as. the sole available organ for the harmonious regulation of many international affairs.    This Conference is a  conference of representatives  of the several Governments of  the  Empire;  its  views and conclusions on Foreign Policy, as recorded above, are  necessarily subject to the action of the Governments and Parliaments  of the various portions of the Empire, and it trusts that the results of its deliberations will meet with their approval.IX.-NEGOTIATION, SIGNATURE  AND  RATIFICATION  OF                          TREATIES.   The principles governing the relations of the various parts of theEmpire in connection with the negotiation,  signature and ratification of Treaties seemed to the Conference to be of the greatest importance.Accordingly it was arranged that the subject should be fuUy examined by a Committee,  of which  the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs was Chairman.  The Secretary of State for the Colonies,  the PrimeMinisters of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New  Zealand,the  Union of South  Africa  and Newfoundland,  the Minister  of external Affairs of the Irish Free State, and the Secretary of Statefor India as Head of the Indian  Delegation,  served on this Oom-mittee.  With the assistance of the Legal  Adviser  to the ForeignOffice, Sir C. J. B. Hurst, K.C.B.,  K.C., the foUowing Resolution was drawn up and agreed to :         &quot;The Conference  recommends for the  acceptance of the    governments of  the Empire represented that the foUowing  pro-    cedure should be observed in the negotiation, signature and ratifica-    tion of international agreements.        &quot; The word &apos; treaty&apos; is used in the sense of an  agreement    which,  in accordance with the  normal practice of diplomacy,    would take the form of a treaty between Heads of States, signed    by plenipotentiaries provided  with Full Powers issued by the    Heads of the States, and authorising the  holders to conclude a   treaty.&quot;    &apos; :&apos;&apos;.                          I-  &apos; -   &quot; 1.  Negotiation.        &quot; (a) It  is desirable that  no treaty should be negotiated by   any of the governments of the Empire without due consideration   of its possible effect on other  parts of the  Empire, or, if circum-   stances so demand, on the Empire as a whole.        &quot; (5) Before  negotiations  are opened  with the intention  of   concluding a treaty, steps should be taken to ensure that any of the   other  governments&apos; of  the  Empire likely to be interested are   informed, so  that,  if any such  government considers  that its   interests would be affected, it may have an opportunity of express-   ing its views, or, when its interests are intimately involved,  of   participating in the negotiations.
    &quot; (c) In all cases where more than one of the governments ofthe Empire participates in the negotiations, there should be thefullest possible exchange of views  between those  governments before and during  the negotiations.  In  the  case of treatiesnegotiated at  International Conferences, where there is a BritishEmpire Delegation, on  which, in accordance with the now estab-lished  practice, the Dominions and  India  are separately repre-sented, such representation should also be utilised  to attain thisobject.    &quot; (d) Steps should  be taken to ensure that those governmentsof the Empire whose representatives are not participating in thenegotiations should, during their progress, be kept informed inregard to any points arising in which they may be interested.&quot;2. Signature.    &quot; (a) Bilateral treaties imposing obligations on one part of theEmpire only should be signed by a representative of the govern-ment of that part.   The Eull Power issued to such representative should indicate the part of the Empire in respect of which theobligations are to be undertaken, and the preamble and text of thetreaty should be so worded as to make its scope clear.   - &quot; (b) Where a bilateral treaty imposes obligations on morethan one part of the Empire, the treaty should be  signed by oneor more plenipotentiaries on behalf of all the governments  con-cerned.    &quot; (c) As  regards treaties  negotiated  at  International Con-ferences, the  existing practice of signature by plenipotentiarieson behalf of all the governments of the Empire represented at theConference should be continued, and the Full Powers should be inthe form employed at Paris and  Washington.&quot; 3. Ratification.    &quot; The existing practice in  connection with the ratification of treaties should be maintained.                              II.    &quot; Apart from treaties made between Heads of States, it is notunusual for agreements to be made  between governments.  such agreements, which are usually of a technical or administrativecharacter,  are  made in the names of the signatory governments,and&apos; signed by representatives  of those governments, who do notact under Full Powers issued by  the Heads of the States:  theyare not ratified by the  Heads of the States, though in some casessome form of acceptance or  confirmation by  the governmentsconcerned is employed.  As regards agreements of this nature theexisting practice  should be continued, but  before  entering on negotiations  the  governments  of the  Empire should  considerwhether the interests of any other part of the Empire  may beaffected, and,  if so,  steps should be taken to ensure that  thegovernment of such part is informed of the proposed negotiations,in order that it may have an.opportunity of expressing its views.
   The Resolution  was submitted to the  full  Conference and unani-mously approved.   It  was thought, however, that it would be  ofassistance to add a short explanatory statement in connection with partI (3), setting out the existing procedure in relation to the ratification of treaties.  This procedure is as follows:     (a) The ratification of treaties imposing obligations on  one  part          of the Empire is effected at the instance of the government          of that part:    (b) The ratification of treaties imposing obligations on more than          one part of the Empire is effected after consultation between          the governments of those parts of  the Empire  concerned.          It is for  each government to decide  whether Parliamentary          approval or legislation is required before desire for, or  con-          currence in, ratification is intimated by that government.X.-THE UNITED STATES AND &quot; C &quot; MANDATES.   Certain general questions concerning the territories in South WestAfrica and the Southern Pacific administered under &quot; C &quot; Mandateshad been raised by the Government of the United States of America,and the opportunity of the Conference was taken to examine thesequestions.XL-CONDOMINIUM  IN  THE  NEW HEBRIDES.   The developments in the New Hebrides since the Conference  of1921 were examined and  the  present situation  and possibilities  ofaction further discussed by representatives of the  British Governmentin consultation  with the Prime Ministers  of  the Commonwealth  ofAustralia and New Zealand.XII.-DEFENCE.   The  Conference  gave special  consideration to the  question  ofDefence, and the manner in which co-operation and mutual assistance could best  be effected after taking into account the  political, and geographical conditions of the  various parts of the Empire.   The Lord President of the Council, as Chairman of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, opened this part of the work of the conference by a statement outlining the main problems of Defence as they existto-day.  He was followed by the First Lord  of  the  Admiralty,  theSecretary of State for War and the Secretary of State  for Air, each ofwhom explained to the Conference the aspects of defence which con-cerned his special responsibilities.   In addition to these statements there was  a full and frank inter-change of views in which the standpoints of the various representatives and the circumstances of their countries were made clear.  There  were
also&quot;&apos; discussions  at the Admiralty and Air Ministry at  which Navaland Air Defence were dealt with in greater detail.  The points involved were explained by the Chiefs of the Naval and Air Staffs respectivelyand were farther examined.   In connection with Naval Defence one matter of immediate  interestcame  before the  Conference, namely, the projected Empire Cruise ofa squadron of modern warships.  The First Lord  of the Admiraltyexplained that the project was that two capital ships, the &quot;  Hood&quot;and the &quot;Repulse,&quot; together with a  small squadron of  modern light cruisers,  should  visit  South  Africa,  Singapore,  Australia  and NewZealand, and return by way of British Columbia, the Panama canal and Eastern Canada.  The light cruisers would accompany the battle cruisers as  far as British  Columbia,  but would return  to Englandby way of the west coast of South  America and Cape  Horn.  TheDominion Prime Ministers expressed their appreciation of this proposal,and assured the  Conference that the ships would be most heartilywelcomed in their countries.   After the whole field of Defence had been surveyed, the Conferencedecided that it would be advisable to record in the following resolutionsits conclusions on the chief matters which had been discussed  :    &quot; (1) The Conference afiirms that it is necessary to provide for the           adequate defence of the territories and trade of the several           countries comprising the British Empire.    (2) In  this  connection  the Conference expressly recognises  that           it is for the Parliaments of the several parts of the Empire           upon the recommendations of their respective Governments           to decide the nature and extent of any action  which should           be  taken by them.    (3) Subject to this provision, the Conference suggests the following           as  guiding principles :         (a) The  primary responsibility of each portion of the  Empire               represented at the Conference for its own  local defence        (6) Adequate provision for safeguarding the maritime com-               mimications of the several parts of the Empire  and the              routes  and waterways along and through whioh their               armed forces and trade pass.        (c) The  provision  of Naval  bases and  facilities  for repair               and fuel so as to ensure the mobility of the fleets.        (d) The desirability of the maintenance of a minimum standard               of Naval Strength, namely, equality with the Naval               Strength of any foreign power, in accordance with the              provisions of the Washington  Treaty on Limitation of               Armament as  approved by Great Britain, all the self-              governing Dominions and India.        (e) The  desirability  of the development  of  the Air Forces              in the several countries of the Empire upon such  lines               as will make it  possible, by means  of the adoption,              as far as practicable, of a common system of organisa-
          tion and training  and the use of uniform manuals,          patterns  of  arms,  equipment,  and stores  (with-the          exception of  the type of  aircraft), for each part of  n A p          the Empire  as  it may determine to co-operate with  U u U          other parts  with  the least  possible  delay and  the          greatest efficiency.  (4) In the application of these principles to the several parts      of the Empire concerned the Conference takes note of : . &apos;    (o) The deep interest  of  the  Commonwealth of  Australia,          the  Dominion  of  New  Zealand, and India, in  the          provision of a Naval Base at Singapore, as essential          for  ensuring the  mobility necessary to provide for the          security  of the  territories  and trade  of  the Empire          in Eastern Waters.    (6) The necessity for the  maintenance of safe passage along          the great route to the East through the Mediterranean          and the Bed Sea.    (c) The necessity  for the  maintenance by Great  Britain of          a Home  Defence Air Eorce of sufficient strength to          give adequate protection  against air  attack by  the          strongest air force within striking distance of her shores.(5) The  Conference, while deeply concerned for  the paramount      importance of providing for the safety and integrity of all      parts of the Empire, earnestly desires, so far as  is consist-      ent with this  consideration, the further limitation of arma-      ments, and trusts that no opportunity may be lost to pro-      mote this object.&quot;XIII.-STATUS  OF HIGH  COMMISSIONERS.   Certain  questions were  discussed relating  to  the status  of  theHigh Commissioners in Great Britain, particularly in connection withprecedence and with exemption from taxation, Customs duties, etc.   The  representatives  of  the  British Government undertook  toexamine the points raised, while explaining that any alteration of theexisting rules of precedence would require the approval of His majesty the King.                                        i,    &apos;XIV.-POSITION OF INDIANS  IN OTHER  PARTS  OF THE                           EMPIRE.   The  position  of  Indians in  other parts  of  the  Empire wasreviewed by the Conference in  the light of the developments whichhave taken place since the Resolution which formed part of the Pro-
ceedings at the 1921 Conference^   The subject was opened by a general statement from the Secretary of State for India as Head of the indian delegation.  He  explained that the  intensity of  feeling  aroused inIndia by this question was due to the opinion widely held there (whichhowever, he did not himself share) that the disabilities of Indians were&apos;based  on distinction of  colour and were badges of racial inferiorityThis statement was followed by a full presentation of the case on behalfof India by Sir Tej  Bahadur Sapru and His Highness the Maharajahof Alwar.    It was found possible to publish these speeches, and those made inthe course of  the discussions by  the Prime Minister of Great Britainthe Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Dominion  Prime ministers and the Minister of External Affairs of the Irish Free State, shortly afterthe speeches had been delivered.-)-   In this respect the procedure differed from that at the Conference of 1921 when only the Resolution adoptedwas made public.  It is  unnecessary in the present Eeport to do morethan Tefer to  the main proposal made on behalf of the Indian Dele-gation and the views  expressed  and conclusions reached  with regardto it.  The Indian proposal was to the effect that the Dominion Govern-ments concerned, and the British  Government for  the Colonies and Pro-protectorates, should agree to  the appointment of Committees to confer with a Committee appointed by the Indian Government as to the best and quickest means  of giving effect to the Eesolution of the 1921 Con-ference.    In the case of the Union of South Africa, which  was  not  a partyto the 1921 Eesolution, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru expressed the hope thatthe Union Government would agree to the Government of India send-ing an agent to South Africa who would protect Indian nationals there,who  would serve as an intermediary between  them and the UnionGovernment,  and who  would place the Indian Government  in  fullpossession of the facts regarding Indian nationals  in South Africa.    The Conference expressed its high appreciation of the able and mode-rate manner in which Lord Peel  and his colleagues had presented  theIndian case.  The opinions expressed and the conclusions reached withregard to the above suggestions were, in brief, as follows :     The Prime Minister  of Canada observed that,  so far  as he knew,Indians now domiciled in Canada did not suffer any legal or politicaldisability in eight out of the nine provinces of Canada ; as regards the ninth province British Columbia he  was not aware of any legaldisability, and even the political disability that existed in the matterof the exercise of the franchise does not apply to all  Indians becausethe federal law relating  to the franchise lays it down  that any Indianwho served with His Majesty&apos;s military, naval or air forces is entitledto the franchise.  He explained the present difficulties  in conceding the franchise to Indians generally in British Columbia which are due  notto distinction of colour but to economic and  complex political  con-siderations, and he reiterated what he had already said to Mr. Sastrion the occasion of the latter&apos;s visit to Canada in 1922, namely, that the* Cmd. 1474, P. 8:    t See Appendix V in Cmd. 1988.
question whether natives of India resident in Canada should be granted a Dominion Parliamentary Franchise on terms and conditions identicalwiththose which govern the exercise of that right by Canadian citizensgenerally was necessarily one which Parliament alone could determine,and that the matter would be submitted to Parliament for considerationwhen the Franchise Law comes up for revision.   Mr. Mackenzie King added that he was somewhat doubtful whetherthe visit of a Committee appointed by the Government of India wouldmake it easier to deal with this problem in Canada, but that, should itbe desired to send a Committee, the  Canadian Government would readily appoint  a Committee to confer  with the Committee from india.   The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia explained the principles underlying the present  attitude  of Australia. on thisquestion.  He stated that the representatives of every shade of politicalthought in Australia had shown sympathy with the claim that lawfullydomiciled Indians should enjoy full citizen rights, and that he believedthat public opinion was ready to welcome, so  far as concerned theposition of such Indians, any measure conceived in the interests of theEmpire as a whole.   The Commonwealth had  the right to control the admission to  itsterritories of new citizens, and its immigration policy was founded oneconomic considerations.  He felt that, in view of the position which existed in Australia, there  was no necessity for  a Committee,  but-assured the Indian representatives that he would consult his colleagues on his return to Australia as to what action  should be  taken in con-nection with the Eesolution of the 1921 Conference.   The Prime Minister  of New Zealand said that the  New zealand government would welcome  the visit of a Committee from India suchas had been suggested should this be desired;  New Zealand practically-gave the  natives of India  now  resident in the Dominion the sameprivileges as were enjoyed by people of the Anglo-Saxon race who were settled there.   The Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa intimated that,so far as South Africa was concerned, it was not a question of colour,but that a different principle was involved.  He stated that the attitudeof thinking men in South Africa was not that the  Indian was inferiorbecause of his colour  or on any other ground he  might  be  theirsuperior but the question had to be considered from the point of viewof economic competition.  In other  words, the white community inSouth Africa felt that the whole question of the continuance of westerncivilisation in South Africa was involved.   General Smuts could holdout no hope of any tether extension of the political rights of indians in South Africa.and, so far as the Union was concerned, he could not accept Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru&apos;s proposal.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies, on behalf of the BritishGovernment,   cordially  accepted  the proposal  of Sir  Tej  BahadurSapru that there should be full consultation and discussion betweenthe Secretary of State for the Colonies and a Committee appointed bythe Government of India upon ah questions affecting British Indians
domiciled in British Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated TerritoriesAt the same time the Duke of Devonshire was careful to explain that&apos;before decisions were taken as a result of discussions with  the Com-mittee,  consultations with the local Colonial Governments concerned and in some cases local enquiry, would be necessary.   Further, while welcoming the proposal, the Duke reminded  theConference that the  British  Government had recently come  to certaindecisions  as to Kenya, which represented in their considered view the very best that could be done in all the circumstances.  While he saw no prospect of these decisions being modified, he would give careful attention to such representations as the Committee appointed by theGovernment of India might  desire to make to him.   Sir Tej  Bahadur  Sapru, while taking note of the  above  statementof the Duke of Devonshire, desired  to make plain that the recentKenya decision could not be accepted as final by the people of India.   The Secretary of State  for India, summarising  as  Head of theIndian Delegation the results attained, pointed out that the  discussion had  demonstrated that it was  a mistake to suppose  that Indiansthroughout the  Empire were given an inferior status  or  that suchdisabilities as might be felt to exist were based on race or colour.XV.-CONTRIBUTION OE INDIA TO THE EXPENSES OP THE                    LEAGUE OE  NATIONS.   The question of the contribution of India to the expenses of theLeague of Nations was raised by the representatives of India at theConference and was referred to a Committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.  It was there explained bySir Tej Bahadur Sapru that India was assessed far higher than any other part of the Empire, except Great Britain.   In 1922, Lord Balfour had stated publicly at a meeting of the Assembly that the various partsof the Empire represented on the League would settle among themselves the exact amount which each would find.  India desired to ascertain whether, in view of this statement, some relief could be afforded by theother parts of the Empire.   The members of the Committee representing Great Britain and theDominions, while  expressing sympathy with the difficulties of India,explained that their Governments were not able to  agree to  any varia-tion from  the standard  of contributions already  laid down by theAssembly for 1923 and 1924.   In the circumstances it was, of course, impossible for the committee as a whole to make  any recommendation.  Sir Tej Bahadur Sapruintimated that India must necessarily reserve the right to raise thequestion of its contribution at the League Assembly of 1924, and theSecretary of State for India, as Head of the Indian Delegation, affirmedthis attitude when the matter came up before the Conference.   The Conference took note of the position.
XVI.-NATIONALITY QUESTIONS.   Certain  questions connected with the  law of British nationalitywere brought before the Conference at the instance of the  Common-wealth Government and were  referred to a  Committee  under theChairmanship of the Secretary of State for  Home Affairs.*  Thesequestions were shortly as follows : (1) The grant of naturalisation to persons resident in Mandated Territories.   Apart from certain special cases, there is under the  existing law no power to grant  an Imperial Certificate of  Naturalisation to a person who  is not qualified by residence in His Majesty&apos;s Dominions.   TheCommonwealth  Government proposed an amendment of the law, so  asto provide for the grant of certificates on the basis of residence in &quot; B &quot;or &quot;  C &quot; Mandated Territories,  i.e., the territories administered underMandates in Africa and  the Southern Pacific.  To this proposal (whichaccorded with certain recent decisions of the Council of the  League  ofNations) the British  Government added the  suggestion that similar provision should be made, generally speaking, in the case of persons resident in British Protectorates.!   The Committee decided to recommend  that the power of grantingCertificates  of  Imperial Naturalisation be extended so as to coverpersons resident in &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; Mandated Territories and also  inProtectorates.(2) Tie appointment of Committees of Enquiry in connection with the      Revocation of Certificates.   A seK-govermng Dominion which has adopted Part II of the british nationality and Status  of Aliens Act, 1914, as amended, has power  inaccordance  with the  provisions of Section 7  of that  Act  to revokecertificates of naturalisation.  Provision is made in the  Act for investi-gation of the circumstances, in given instances, by a Committee  ofEnquiry, presided over by a person who holds or has held high judicialoffice.  The  Commonwealth statute adopting Part II of the ImperialAct kid down  a definition of  high judicial  office  which  it  is nowanticipated  may cause difficulty  in some  cases, as  persons of theprescribed standing may not  be  available.   The  commonwealth government accordingly contemplated the adoption  of a  somewhatwider definition.   The Committee came to the following  conclusion:   -        &quot; Having  heard the reasons  for  which the  Commonwealth    Government is disposed to provide that the presidency  over such    Committees of Enquiry may, where convenient, be taken by persons    holding  judicial office of lower standing than that prescribed  at    present  by  the Commonwealth  statute,  the Committee see no    objection to a question of  machinery of this nature being settled    according to local  circumstances and needs, if after examination    of the experience of the  Committee of Enquiry, and of the practice    which has grown up in the United Kingdom, the  Commonwealth    Government desires to  make an alteration.&quot;  * For the  memorandum prepared by the Commonwealth Government seeAppendix VI, Part I, in Cmd. 1988.  t  For a joint memorandum on this subject by the Home Office and the ColonialOffice sec Appendix VI, Part II,  in Cmd. 1988.
(3) The Nationality of Married Women.   The Commonwealth Government proposed an amendment  of theImperial nationality law as to the nationality of British-born  womenmarried to aliens.   Under  the present law the national status of the wife follows that of her husband ;  a British woman becomes an alienon her marriage to an alien, and there is no power to naturalise herduring the continuance of the marriage.  The Commonwealth Govern-ment have found that the wife&apos;s loss of British nationality tends togive rise to hardship in cases where the wife is separated from, or hasbeen deserted by, her husband, and: they accordingly suggested an alteration of the law to cover such cases.   This proposal raises wider questions of principle and policy in regardto the national status of married  women, which have attracted con-siderable  attention in recent years  both within the British Empireand  in certain foreign countries.*   A number  of arguments for and against maintaining the existing rule that  &quot;The  wife of  a  british subject shall be deemed to be a British subject and the wife of an alienshall be deemed to be an alien &quot; will be found in the two draft Reports!prepared  by Members of a Select Committee of both Houses of theBritish Parliament who  examined this  question earlier in the  year inconnection with, proposals  which had been made for  a fundamentalalteration in the law.                                       &apos;   The discussion of this question by the Committee of the Conferencedid not disclose any opinion in favour of altering the existing law asto the nationality  of husband and wife ; and  the following resolution was  passed : &apos;         &quot; The Committee are  of opinion that the principle of  the     existing law that the nationality of a married woman depends     on that of her husband should be maintained.  They nevertheless     recommend that power should be taken to re-admit a woman to     British  nationality in cases where the married  state, though sub-     sisting in law,  has to  all practical  purposes come to an end.&quot;   The conclusions of the Committee were reported to the Conferenceand  received approval.XVII.-VALIDITY  OP MARRIAGES  BETWEEN  BRITISH                SUBJECTS  AND  FOREIGNERS.   Another matter suggested by the Commonwealth Government foiconsideration  by the Conference concerned  the law relating to the validity  of  marriages between British subjects and  foreigners.  Themain difficulty appears to be that  suoh  a marriage, although validljcontracted in  British law, may nevertheless  in certain circumstances be invalid in the law of the foreign country concerned.^   The Committee, under the Chairmanship  of the  Home Secretary,to whom this question was referred, came to the  conclusion that, havingexamined the  action which is being taken by the Foreign Office and   *  The. subject in its various aspects  is dealt with  briefly an a Memorandum! repared by the Home Office, for which see Appendix VIIV.!&quot;. !.l I, in Cmd. 19&quot;&quot;   t Published in house of Commons paper 115 of 1923.   j  For the correspondence see Appendix VI.  Part IVj in Omd. 1988.
[he Home Office to carry into effect the Marriage with Foreigners Act,1906, they had no recommendation to make.

SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS.    THE full Report of  the proceedings  of the Imperial Economic Conference will be presented to Parliament as soon as practicable, and will include a record of  the discussions partly in the form of verbatim extracts from the  speeches and  partly in the form  of precis, together with copies of documents, such as Memoranda and Reports of  Committees of the Conference  which are of  sufficient importance or general public interest to warrant their publication. In the meantime the Conference have thought it desirable to issue the following Resolutions  adopted by them under various headings of their Agenda.   The great bulk  of these Resolutions, together with the tenour of the discussions leading up to them, have already been published in the Press  from  time  to time during the sitting of the  Conference.                      RESOLUTIONS.     1. OVERSEA SETTLEMENT WITHIN THE EMPIRE.   It was  decided to adopt the following Resolution:        This  Imperial Economic  Conference approves the Report   of the  Committee appointed  to consider questions  relating  to   oversea  settlement.*   The  Conference  endorses  the recom-   mendations  of the Committee and notes with  satisfaction the   arrangements as recorded in the Report which have been arrived   at,  or  are in contemplation, with  a  view to improving the   facilities  for settlement within  the Empire.       The  Conference  takes this  opportunity  of reaffirming  its   sense of  the importance of the policy of oversea settlement  to   the well-being of the Empire.    2. CO-OPERATION IN  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO                IMPERIAL DEVELOPMENT.   It was agreed that the Scheme recommended by the Committeeon Co-operation in Financial  Assistance to Imperial Developmentbe adopted.  The Report of the Committee reads as follows        The  Committee on Financial Go-operation recommends for   adoption  by the Conference  the following  scheme  which was   submitted to the Committee by the  representatives  of His   Ma]&apos;esty&apos;s  Government.         The suggestion which the Imperial Government make  is      that  in order to facilitate the anticipation  of work  which      otherwise would not be taken- in hand for some  3&apos;ears they      should give  a contribution towards the interest charges  on      loans  raised for capital expenditure of this  kind by public      utility  undertakings (viz., communications, power lighting,   * Tho Report will be included in a  Blue Book which will be shortlypresented to Parliament.   Wt.--2100 11/23 F.O.P. [10871]                         B 2   Wt. 206i4/4G2 1000 11/23 [10943]
       water, drainage, irrigation, &amp;c).  These undertakings might       be under either public or private control or management.          The  assistance, would be in respect  of expenditure on       orders placed in this country and would be applicable  only       to schemes approved by the Dominion or Central Government    :   concerned and certified by it to be in anticipation of normal       expenditure.   Payment  would  be made  to  the  Dominion       or  Central  Government which would be  responsible  for       payment to the ultimate recipient.          It is  suggested that the  maximum grant should be three-       quarters of the interest charges  for a period of five years.          In order to qualify for the Imperial contribution a scheme       must be  accepted by the Imperial Government within the       next three years.  The approval.on behalf  of the Imperial       Government  would be  given  after  consultation with the       Treasury, the Colonial or  India Office  and the Board of      . Trade.          It  would  be  understood that - priority will  be given to       schemes involving the earliest placing of orders.                 3.  IMPERIAL PBEFEBENCE.                     (1.)  Tariff Preference.   It was decided to adopt the following Resolution :-       This Imperial Economic Conference, holding that, especially   in present circumstances, all possible means  should be taken to   develop the  resources of  the  Empire and trade between the   Empire countries,  desires  to  reaffirm the Resolution on the   subject of Imperial Preference passed by the  Imperial War   Conference of 1917.   Further,  as  regards  Imperial Preference under  the UnitedKingdom  Customs Tariff to Empire goods, His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment intimated  that they intended to submit  to  Parliament thefollowing proposals : Dried Fruit.   At present dried figs, raisins and plums (includes apricots) aredutiable at the  rate  of IDs.  6d. per cwt., if from foreign countries and enjoy if of Empire origin a  preference of one-sixth, Le.,  ofIs. 9d. per ewt.   It  is proposed  to  admit these goods  free  of  duty from thoEmpire so  that Empire raisins,  figs  and  plums will enjoy a preference of 10s. 6d. per cwt.Currants.   At present dried currants aredutiable at the rate of 2s. per ewt.and enjoy a preference of one-sixth, which on the existing duty onlyamounts to id.   His Majesty&apos;s Government  are prepared to offer free admission to Empire currants and to consider what increase  in the duty on
  foreign currants may be necessary to make the preference effective,  such increase to come into force at a future date to be agreed upon.  Other Dried Fruit.    At present there is no duty on any other dried fruit,  but  whilst  continuing to admit such Empire  dried  fruit free,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government would propose to impose a duty of 10s. 6d. per cwt. on  such foreign  dried fruit  (e.g., apples,  pears and  peaches)  as the Dominion representatives may consider of interest to their trade.  Other Preserved Fruits.    Preserved fruits  other  than those mentioned  above are  not dutiable save in respect of sugar contents, if any.   It is proposed in addition  to any such duty  on the sugar contents to impose  an all-round duty of  5s. per cwt. on the principal forms of preserved fruit not at present dutiable,  except fruit pulp for jam manufacture, which will remain free  of duty.  All such fruit  will be admitted free from the Empire. Sugar.   At present sugar is dutiable according to a scale dependent  on the polarisation of the sugar with a basis  rate of 25s. 8d. per cwt. on fully refined sugar.   Empire sugar  enjoys  a preference of  one-sixth or 4s.  3%d.  per cwt., being  nearly a halfpenny a pound on refined sugar.   It  is  not possible  at present  to  offer   an  increase in this preference, but His  Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to  guarantee that if the duty is reduced the preference shall for a period of ten years not fall with  it, but  be maintained  at its  present rate  of nearly \&amp;. per pound so long at least as the  duty on foreign  sugar does not fall below  that level. Tobacco.   At present the duty on tobacco varies  according to kind,  being of course higher on  cigars than on unmanufactured tobaccos.  On the latter it is about 8s.  2d. per lb.., on which the Empire enjoys a preference of one-sixth or,  say, on raw tobacco  of Is. 4cL   Hi3 Majesty&apos;s Government  would be prepared  to  adopt the course proposed in regard to sugar,  Le.,  to stabilise the existing preference for a term of years or alternatively they are prepared toincrease (he  preference  to  one-quarter,  i.e.,  to  about 2s.  on unmanufactured  tobacco  at  present rates,  the  amount  of thepreference of  course varying as the basis varies.   As a result of consultation with the oversea representatives con- eerned,  it has been decided to adopt the second alternative, i.e., toraise the Preference  from one-sixth to one-quarter.Wine.   THE proposals  are :    1. To  double  the existing preference of  2s. per gallon on the          duty of  6s. per gallon on wines of a strength exceeding      -   30&quot;  and not exceeding 42&quot;.  The rate  of duty  on  such          wines coming  from the Empire would  thus become 2s.          per  gallon.   [10871]                                                 B 3
   2. To increase from 30 per cent, to 50 per cent, the preference         on the surtax of 12s. 6d. per gallon on Sparkling Wine.Raw Apples.   It is proposed to levy a duty of 5s. per cwt. on Eaw Apples offoreign origin and to admit Eaw Apples from the Empire free of dutyas at present.Canned Salmon and Canned Lobster, Cray Pish and Crabs.   It is proposed that  a duty of 10s. per cwt. shall be imposed onforeign Canned Salmon and Canned Lobster,  Cray Pish  and Crabs,and that these goods shall be admitted free of duty from the Empire.Honey.   It is proposed that  a duty of 10s. per cwt. shall be imposed onforeign honey, and  that Honey of Empire origin  shall continue tobe admitted free of duty.Lime, Lemon  and other Fruit Juices.   The  proposal  of His Majesty&apos;s Government is  that a duty atthe rate of  6d. per gallon shall be imposed  on foreign Lime andLemon Juices and  His Majesty&apos;s Government would  consider  alist of other Fruit Juices which the  Dominions regarded  as ofinterest to their trade.   The same duty would fall on  Fruit Syrupsand  would  be  exclusive of the duty on  the  sugar content of suchsyrups.  Fruit Juices from the Empire will continue to be admittedfree of duty.          (2.) Imperial Preference in Public  Contracts.   It was decided to adopt  the following Eesolution :    (1.) &quot;That this Imperial Economic  Conference re-affirms  the         principle  that in all Government contracts effective Pre-         ference be given to goods made and materials produced         within  the  Empire except  where  undertakings entered         into prior to this  Conference  preclude  such a course or         special    circumstances   render   it   undesirable  or         unnecessary.&quot;   (2.) &quot;That so far as practicable, efforts be made to ensure that         the materials used in carrying out contracts  be of Empire         production.&quot;   (3.) &quot;That State,  provincial and local government  authorities         should  be encouraged to  take  note of the  foregoing         resolutions.&quot;    4. FUETHEB  STEPS FOE THE  IMPEOVEMENT OF                      MUTUAL TEADE.    --(A.) Imperial Co-operation in respect of commercial Intelligence.   It was decided.to adopt the following resolutions :-(i.)  commercial Diplomatic and Consular Services.      &apos;&apos; This Imperial Economic Conference takes note  of the offer of   His Majesty&apos;s  Government to place the services of His Majesty&apos;s
   Commercial Diplomatic Officers in foreign countries at the disposal   of the Governments of the Dominions and  India and  of  the   Colonies  and Protectorates in.the same  way  and to the same   extent as the  services of His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioners   within the Empire are already at their disposal.. It notes that His   Majesty&apos;s Government propose that as regards countries outside   of Europe the  Governments should  utilise direct. the services   of Commercial Diplomatic Officers or of senior Consular Officers   where no Commercial Diplomatic Officers have been appointed,   but that  communications which  it is proposed to  address  to   Commercial  Diplomatic Officers  in European countries  should   be transmitted in  the first instance to the Department  of   Overseas  Trade.      &quot; The Conference, recognising the importance of all possible   steps  being taken to strengthen the mutual co-operation of the   several  parts   of   tho   Empire  in  matters  of  commercial   intelligence with a  view  to  the development  of Empire trade,   welcomes  the  arrangements  proposed  by  His   Majesty&apos;s   Government.      &quot;It also welcomes the  offer of the Governments cf the   Dominions  which  have  appointed  Trade  Commissioners   in   countries  overseas  to make a  similar  arrangement for the   utilisation of those  officers  by Governments  of other parts  of   the Empire.      &quot;The Conference further recommends  that,  when  two  or   more  Governments  of   the  Empire  maintain  commercial   representatives  in the  same country, an endeavour should be   made  to arrange that the offices of these representatives should   be in the same building or in close  proximity,  in order  to   facilitate  all  possible co-operation between such representatives   in their work on behalf of Empire trade.&quot;(ii;)  Commercial Travellers&apos; Samples.      &quot;This Imperial  Economic Conference proposes that  articles   liable  to duty imported into  any part of the British  Empire  as   samples or specimens by  commercial  travellers  representing   manufacturers  or  traders established in any  other part  of the   British Empire, should be temporarily admitted  free of duty,   subject to such persons complying with the laws and regulations   and also  the  Customs formalities  established  to assure  the   re-exportation or deposit in bond of the articles  or the payment  of   the prescribed  Customs duties if not re-exported  or deposited   within the prescribed period.   But the foregoing privilege should   not extend to articles which, owing to  their quantity or  value,   cannot be considered as samples, or which, owing to their nature,   could not  be identified upon re-exportation.      &quot; The marks,  stamps, or seals placed upon such samples   by the Customs authorities  of any part of the Empire at the   time  of  exportation and the. officially attested  list of  such   samples containing a full description thereof,  including, in the   case of goods liable  to ad valorem duty, a statement of  their
    value, should be accepted by the Customs officials of any other    part of the Empire as establishing their character as samples    and exempting them from inspection,  except so far as may be    necessary  to  establish that the samples produced are those    enumerated in the list.       &apos;&apos; The Customs authorities  of that  part of the Empire into    which   the  samples  are  brought  may,  however,  affix  a    supplementary mark to such  samples  or lists in  special cases    where  they may think this precaution necessary.       &quot;In cases .where the  regulations  require  the provisional    payment of the duties or deposits for such samples on entry a    receipt for  such payment  should be given and  the  duties  or    deposits. should be reimbursed at any Custom-house  at which    the samples may be produced with a view to re-exportation.&quot;(iii.)  Trade Catalogues.     -  &quot; This  Imperial  Economic  Conference proposes that, where    freer admission of catalogues and price lists is not provided for,    single  copies of trade catalogues and price lists of firms having an    established place of business within the  Empire, sent by post, or    with consignments of goods, from any part of the British Empire,    to business firms in  any  other part  of  the British Empire,    should be  admitted free of duty,  provided that they are the    trade  catalogues or price lists of firms  or persons having  no    established place of business in the  territory  to which they are    sent.&quot;                        (B.) Statistics.      &apos;&apos; This Imperial Economic Conference, recognising the impor-    tance of rendering the trade statistics published by the Government   of the United Kingdom as valuable as possible with reference to the    development of inter-Imperial trade, recommends that the United   Kingdom  Board  of Trade,  after  reviewing the  statistics  in    question from this  point of view, should draw up a  detailed    scheme and submit  it to  the. Governments of the several parts   of  the  Empire for their consideration.&quot;                (C.) Imperial Communications.(i.) Shipping.      (a.) Imperial Shipping Committee.   It  was  agreed to adopt the following Resolutions :-      &apos;&apos; That this Imperial Economic Conference desires to convey   to Sir Ilalford Mackinder,  as Chairman of the Imperial Shipping   Committee,  and ; to ...the. Members  of  that  Committee,  an   expression of its appreciation of the very.excellent work which   they have done during, the period of  the Committee&apos;s existence,   both in the interests  of  the  commercial and producing.com-   munities, and  of British citizens generally.&quot;
                              (2.)       &quot; That this Imperial Economic Conference is of opinion :        &quot; (1.) That the work accomplished by the Imperial Shipping   Committee  is  convincing proof of the wisdom of its establish-   ment, and that it is of the highest importance to the Empire that   this work should continue;       &quot;(2.) That  it  is,  therefore,  desirable to  maintain  the   Committee  on its present basis,  deriving  authority from, and   responsible to, the Governments represented  in the Imperial   Conference.&quot;       (b.)  Carriage of Goods by Sea.   It was agreed that the following Resolution be adopted &apos;:-       &apos;&apos; This Imperial Economic Conference having examined  the   Eules relating to Bills of Lading recommended by the Inter-   national Conference  on Maritime  Law  held  at  Brussels  in   October, 1922, and embodied in the Carriage of Goods by Sea   Bill now before the  British Parliament, is of opinion that in all   essential principles  they are  based upon the Canadian Water   Carriage of Goods Act, 1910, and  the Report  of the Imperial   Shipping Committee,  1921,  and believing  that there is  a good   prospect of international agreement in regard to bills of lading   on  this basis  which would  he of benefit to every part  of the   Empire, considers that these Rules can be recommended  for   adoption by the Governments and Parliaments of the Empire.&quot;(ii.)  Air Navigation.   It was decided to adopt the following Resolutions :    (I.) That  the British  Government  should circulate  to: the         Dominions and India a statement showing the  present         anticipated operational performances of rigid airships and         in the future should circulate regularly up-to-date infor-         mation of the progress, of the Burney airship proposals in         order that consideration of Empire participation in these         or future  airship proposals might be  facilitated.   (2.) That, the  British  Government should prepare  a draft pro-         cedure designed on a reciprocal basis to secure more rapid         and more  extensive interchange of information  in regard         to civil aeronautics and should submit this for the con-         sideration of the other Governments of the Empire with &apos;         a view to  general adoption.   (3.) That having regard to post-war developments, any British         oversea  countries which have no up-to-date experience of         air photography and contemplate the use of air survey,         would be well advised, whenever possible, to consult other         Empire Governments  having  such  experience  before         accepting  estimates or schemes providing for its use.&quot;(iii.)  Cables and Wireless.   It was agreed that-the following Resolutions be adopted :       (a.) That  this Imperial  Economic  Conference  affirms  the   importance  of establishing as quickly  as possible an efficient
   Imperial Service of Wireless Communication,  and is of opinion   that the several Governments of the Empire should take imme-   diate action to remove any difficulties which  are now  delaying   the accomplishment of this, while providing  adequate safeguards   against the subordination of public to private interests.       (b.) That representatives of the Dominions and India should   be  associated in  the work of  the  Imperial Communications   Committee  when  questions  of  interest  to  them  are under   consideration.       (c,) That in view of the fact that the Dominions interested in   the Pacific cable have for a long time pressed for the provision   of a State-owned connecting.link  across the Atlantic, all possible   support should be given by the Governments  of the Empire to   the  State-owned  Atlantic  cable  route which has  now been   provided.       (d.) That in  any concessions  given in the British Empire to   private enterprise in respect  of cable  or  wdreless  services   (including broadcasting stations), preference should be accorded   to British Companies of any part  of the Empire.&quot;(D.) Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments, including Arbitration                            Awards.   It was decided to  adopt the following Resolution :       &apos;&apos; This Imperial Economic Conference take note of the action   already taken in many parts of the Empire  to carry into effect   the proposal  contained  in  Resolution XXV  of  the Imperial   Conference,  1911, with regard to mutual  arrangements with a  . view to the enforcement in one part of the Empire of judgments   and orders  of the Courts of Justice  in another part, including   judgments or orders for the enforcement of commercial arbitra-   tion awards.   While, it is recognised  that in certain Dominions   theso  matters come within the  scope of Provincial or State   Governments whose freedom of action could not be bound by  any   decision of  the Dominion or Central Gov rmnent, the general  . view of the  Imperial Economic Conference  is that  a universal   arrangement throughout  the Empire  for the. reciprocal  enforce-   ment of judgments,  including arbitration  awards, could not  fail   to be valuable and advantageous to trade  and commerce, and is   accordingly an object at which the different parts of the Empire   should  aim.&quot;(E.)-Imperial  Co-operation with reference to Patents, Designs  and                       Trade  Marks.   It was decided to  adopt  the. following Resolution:       &quot;This Imperial  Economic  Conference have given careful   consideration to  the Provisional  Scheme recommended in  the   Report of the British Empire Patent Conference, 1922, and they   are  of opinion that, apart from one or two details which might   receive  further  consideration  by  correspondence  between  the   heads  of  the Patent  Offices,  the  Provisional  Scheme is. a
   practicable one, and promises considerable advantages to British   inventors throughout the Empire;  but in view of the difficulties   felt by the  Dominion  of  Canada as regards the absence of any   provision for reciprocal registration of Dominion  patents, the   Conference  feel unable to make any recommendation so  far as   the Self-Governing Dominions end India are concerned.      &quot; Tbe Conference,  however,  unanimously agree that it is very   desirable that the Provisional Scheme should be adopted by the   Colonies and Protectorates, and that considerable benefits would   thereby be derived by  inventors throughout the Empire.&quot;                   (P.) Economic Defence.   It was decided to  adopt the following resolution :       &quot;In view of the vital importance to the.British Empire of   safeguarding its  overseas carrying trade against all forms of   discrimination by  foreign countries, whether  open or disguised,   the representatives of  the Governments of the  Empire declare       &quot;(1.) That  it  is  their  established  practice to  make no   discrimination between the flags of shipping using their  ports,   and that they have no intention of. departing from  this  practice   as regards countries which treat ocean-going shipping under the   British flag  on  a  footing of  equality with- their own national   shipping.      &quot; (2.) That in the  event of danger arising;in future to the   overseas shipping of the Empire through an attempt  by a foreign   country to discriminate against the British flag, the Governments   of  the  Empire will consult  together  as to the best means of   meeting the  situation.&quot;                  (G.) Customs Formalities.(i.) Valuation of Goods for Customs Duty Purposes.   It was decided to adopt the following Resolutions :                             Form A.      &apos;&apos; A  common  form of invoice  and certificate  for  use by   exporters having been adopted by  Australia, New Zealand,  the   Union of South  Africa,  and Newfoundland,  as  well as  by a   number  of  Colonies,  the Conference strongly recommends, in   the  general  interests  of inter-Imperial: trade, that the  early   adoption of an identical form may be sympathetically considered   by  all tire other  Governments throughout ,the  Empire, which   levy  duty on a system  similar to that  in  force in the above-   mentioned parts of the Empire.      &quot;The Conference understands that legislation to give  effect   to  the  recommendations  of  the Imperial Customs  Conference   has already  been  passed in Australia  and New  Zealand, and   they  venture to  urge the passing of similar legislation in  every   case in which such may  prove to be necessary.&quot;
      &quot; The Conference has  had before it  a  form of invoice and   certificate which has been prepared as suitable for use in those   parts  of  the  Empire which  levy duty on  the  invoice value of   goods imported from other  parts  of  the Empire,  and require   for this purpose a certified statement made by the exporter of   the goods.      &quot;The Conference strongly recommends, in the interests of   inter-Imperial  trade, the  early  adoption  by  all  parts of  the   Empire which levy duty on the system in  question of the form   annexed  to this Resolution. &quot;*             Certificate in  Regard  to Postal  Packages.      &quot;The attention.of the Conference has been drawn to  the   short  form  of certificate  prepared by the Imperial Customs   Conference, 1921, for use as establishing the origin of goods sent   by parcel post from  the United Kingdom.      &quot;It understands that  this form  has already been adopted   by a number of the  Dominions and Colonies, and considers that   in the interests of inter-Imperial trade the  adoption of a similar   form  is desirable in the case of parcels arriving in one part of   the Empire from another  part.      &apos;&apos; The Conference therefore strongly recommends that, in   the  case of parcels  sent by  parcel post,  the contents of which   are of small value and are not merchandise for sale, the following   short  form of  certificate  should be  adopted at an early date   by all parts of the Empire concerned, as providing satisfactory   evidence of the origin of the goods in cases  where the production   of such evidence entitles the goods to entry at a  lower rate of   duty than would otherwise obtain :           &quot; The contents of this package are  not  merchandise for      sale,  and  every  article herein, to  the extent of at least      one-fourth of its present value, is lona fide the produce or      manufacture of.........................................................

It was decided  to adopt the following Resolution :       &quot;That  the Conference   should   take  note  of  the  work   accomplished by the recent  League  of  Nations  International   Conference on--Customs and other Similar Formalities (the 15th :  October to the 3rd November, 1923), and  that the conclusions of   that   Conference  should  be  recommended  for  favourable   consideration to the  various Empire Governments concerned.                         * See Appendix.
           (H.)-Empire Currency and Exchange.  The Imperial Economic Conference adopted  and endorsed theallowing Resolutions,  submitted to them by the Committee on Inter-mporial Exchanges :   (1.)  &quot; That, arising as they do from the suspension of an effective       gold standard, the  difficulties of Inter-Imperial oxchange       will disappear  when the currencies  of Great Britain and       the Dominions affected are again made convertible into       gold-  (2.)  &quot;That it is neither necessary nor desirable  to  adopt com-       plicated  plans  for a new instrument of credit,  such as       Empire  Currency Bills, which involve difficult and dis-       pntable constitutional and financial  questions.  (3.)  &quot;That where  difficulties have arisen in regard to exchange       between certain  parts of the  Empire and  between such       parts and the United Kingdom,       &quot;(a.) The position could be ameliorated if the note-issuing             authorities  were to accumulate sterling assets and to             undertake  to exchange  their  local  currencies for             sterling and vice versa.       &quot;(6.)  This  measure might be  further  developed  and             assisted by the  creation of central  banks and by             mutual co-operation as recommended  by  the Genoa             Conference.       &quot; (c.)  In some cases the bank charges for buying  and             selling sterling appear to be unduly high and should             be capable of reduction.&quot;  (J.) Co-operation for Technical Research and Information.  It was decided to adopt  the following Resolutions :                        Resolution  1.    &quot;This  Imperial  Economic Conference  recommends  the  adoption of  the first  of the two schemes  for  the  future of the  Imperial Institute  and the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau  proposed in the Report* of the.Imperial Institute  Committee of  Enquiry, 1923, subject  to the following modifications :   &quot; (i.) That in  order to ensure that  the  reconstituted Imperial       Institute may in  future undertake in its laboratories only       preliminary investigations of raw materials for the purpose       of ascertaining their possible commercial  value, and to       ensure that  investigation or research of a more extensive       kind may be referred to the appropriate authority, whether       in this country or elsewhere  in the Empire, ther-s shall be       formed a small Committee of the Governing Body, to be       known as the &quot;Laboratory Committee,&apos; consisting of the       Comptroller-General of  the Department of Overseas  Trade       (or his  nominee),  the  Secretary, of the ,Scientific; and          * This Report will be published in due course.
      Industrial Research Department (or his nominee),  and a      Fellow ol the Royal Society, being a representative of that      Society on the Governing Body of the Imperial Institute,      who will supervise the  laboratory work  of the Institute      and report thereon from time to time to the Governing      Body.&quot; (ii.) That, with a view to ensuring that in future the reconsti-      tuted Institute may have  expert assistance  in regard to      finance, e.y., in establishment matters,  a representative      of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury  be added to the new Governing      Body and  to  the new Managing Committee  proposed in      paragraphs 100  and 101  of the Report  of  the Imperial      Institute Committee of Enquiry.&quot;   &quot;This Imperial Economic Conference approves the estimateof the cost of maintaining the reconstituted Institute as set out inparagraph 5  of the memorandum by the Seoretary of State forthe Colonies  submitted to the Conference (LEX. (23)-l8); andsuggests that in order that the sum of  8,000, which is proposed as an annual contribution from the Dominions and  India,  maybe obtained, the ministerial representatives of the Dominionsand  of  India advise  their respective  legislatures  to contributethe following annual amounts for a period of five years :-       &apos;&apos; This  Imperial.

           (K.) Immunity of State Enterprises.It was decided that the following resolutions be adopted :                            I.   This Imperial Economic Conference, so far as it is competentfor its members without prejudice to the rights of the States orProvinces of a self-governing Dominion, agrees with the recom-mendation of the Committee on the Liability of  Dominion  andForeign  Governments,  &amp;c,   to   United  Kingdom   taxationexpressed in the following terms,  viz. :       &quot; Any Government  within  the Empire, so  far  as  it   engages in trade,  shall be treated as liable  to the  taxation   of any other country  within the  Empire, in which it may   either own property in connection with trade, or  make trade   profits;  the liability of the United Kingdom  Government or   any  Dominion Government  so far as engaged in trade shall   be co-extensive with  the liability of a private  trading  cor-   poration in similar  circumstances.&quot;   It is agreed  that each of the several Parliaments of GreatBritain, the Dominions and India shall be invited to enact at theearliest  opportunity a  declaration that the general and particularprovisions of its Acts  or ordinances imposing taxation  shall bedeemed to apply  to  any  commercial  or  industrial enterprisecarried on by or  on behalf of any other such Governments in thesame manner in all respects as if  it were carried  on by or onbehalf of a, subject of the British Crown. It is not contemplated that such  legislation  should have retrospective effect  for any year prior to  1924.    This Conference further agrees that, as soon  as possible after the passing of the aforesaid legislation, negotiations should be opened  with the  Governments of foreign countries, in accordance with the recommendations of the aforesaid.Committee,  &quot; with a view  to reciprocal agreement between those countries and the Empire to  the following effect:  if or when the Government of a foreign country  carries on trade in the United Kingdom or in a Dominion, and if or when the Government of a country within the British Empire carries on trade  in a foreign  country, the trading Government  shall not, in  its character  as  such,  be treated as entitled to any sovereign immunity from taxation either  directly  or through the  claim of  superiority to the jurisdiction of municipal  Courts;  nor shall a  Government  so trading be treated as entitled  to any sovereign immunity  from taxation in respect of property in the other country concerned which it may own or hold in a trading capacity  or in connection with trade.    &quot;It is understood that, as the Committee recommended,  it would be  a  proviso to the whole  agreement that it should  be without prejudice to  the  national interests  of a  sovereign State in any  emergency of war.&quot;
                              II.    &quot; The Conference further recommends that the draft conven-convention on  the immunity of  State-owned ships  adopted by  themeeting of  the  International  Maidtime   Committee  held atGothenburg  in August last,  and  amended  after consultation between  the British  Admiralty  and Board  of  Trade, should beadopted throughout the Empire as  the basis on which an inter-national  convention might be concluded.  This amended draft isas follows :                  .             &quot; Immunity of State-owned Ships.           &quot; (Amended Draft:  October 26, 1923.)    &quot;Article 1. Vessels owned or operated by  States fortrading  purposes, cargoes owned  by them, and  cargo and passengers carried on such vessels and the States owning oroperating such vessels shall be subjected in respect of claimsrelating to the operation of such vessels or to such cargoes tothe same rules of legal liability (i.e., liability to be sued for payment) and to  the  same obligations as those  applicable to private vessels,  persons or cargo.    &quot;Article 2.-Such liabilities  shall be enforceable by the tribunals having jurisdiction  over and by  the procedureapplicable  to  a  privately-owned ship.or cargo or the ownerthereof.    &quot;Article 3. Ships  of  war,  State Yachts,  SurveyingVessels,  Hospital Ships and other vessels owned or  operated by States and employed on other than hading purposes  shall continue to enjoy the respective  privileges and immunitieshitherto  enjoyed  by them  by   the  comity  of  nations.Liabilities  against: such  ships  in respect of  collisions  orsalvage  claims shall,  however, be enforceable,  but only by action before the  competent tribunals of the State owning oroperating such vessels; and no such vessel shall be liable to arrest.   Similarly,  State-owned  cargo  carried for  non-commercial purposes in ships owned or operated by the state shall  not be subject to seizure, but shall be liable to processof Law, but only in  the Courts  of the State  owning  such vessels.      &apos;  &quot;   \&apos;Article  4.-The  provisions  of this Convention will beapplied in every contracting  State in all  cases where theclaimant is a citizen of one of the contracting States,  provided always that nothing in this  Convention shall prevent any ofthe contracting States  from settling by its own laws the rightsallowed to  its own citizens before its own Courts.   &quot;Article 5.-This  Convention shallnot be binding  on abelligerent State  in  respect&apos;of-claims  arising  during, theperiod of belligerency.&quot;
  5 IMPERIAL POLICY WITH REGARD TO THE IMPORT               AND EXPORT OP LIVESTOCK.   After  consideration of this question,  the  Imperial  EconomicConference decided that  steps should be taken to promote Inter-Imperial trade in pedigree stock throughout the Empire as a wholeon reciprocal terms, subject always to satisfactory precautions beingtaken against the introduction of disease.   It was further -agreed that a Conference should be  arranged between  representatives  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government  and  theCanadian Government to consider the question of the administrativeinterpretation of the terms of &apos;&apos; The Importation of Animals  Act,1922.&quot;  6. IMPERIAL POLICY WITH REGARD TO FORESTRY.   It was decided to adopt the following Resolution:       &quot; That the Imperial Economic Conference accepts  generally   the Resolutions of the  Empire  Forestry  Conference  (Canada,   1923), and recommends them to tbe  respective Governments of   the Empire for their favourable consideration.&quot;*             7. WORKMEN&apos;S COMPENSATION,   It was decided to adopt the following Resolutions:                        RESOLUTION I.                   Non-resident Workmen.      &quot; That this Imperial Economic Conference, taking note of the   existing  restrictions in  the Workmen&apos;s Compensation laws of   certain parts  of the British Empire on the payment of benefits to   workmen and their dependants  on the  ground of non-residence   in the State in which  the accident happened, and having regard   to the tendency  of such  restrictions to discourage movement   within the Empire, is of opinion that no British subject who is   permanently   incapacitated, and  no  dependant of a British   subject who has been  killed, by accident due to his employment   in any part of the Empire should be excluded from any benefit   to which  he  would otherwise be entitled under the Workmen&apos;s   Compensation law of that part of the Empire on the ground of   his removal to or residence in another part of the Empire.&quot;                       RESOLUTION II.                          Seamen.      &quot;That this Imperial Economic Conference, having had its   attention drawn  to  cases  where British  sailors  injured by   accident while serving on ships  registered, in some part of the   Empire  have had no  claim to  compensation  owing  to the  law   of that part  of the Empire being restricted,  in  its  application   * It is understood that  the Report of the Empire Forestry Conference(Canada, 1923), is being communicated separately to the Press.
    to seamen,  to  accidents occurring within territorial waters or    other limited area, is of opinion that  the  Government of any    such part of the  Empire should ensure that the benefits of its    compensation law will extend  to all accidents to seamen serving    on ships registered within such part of the Empire wherever the    ship  may  be when the accident takes place.  And furthermore    the Conference  invites the Government  of any British Colony or    Protectorate where there is a register  of shipping, but where    legislation giving compensation rights  to seamen  does not at    present exist, to consider the adoption of such legislation.&quot;                         RESOLUTION  III.                             Aliens.       &apos;&apos; That this  Imperial Economic Conference, taking note of    the disabilities  imposed under  the   Workmen&apos;s Compensation    laws  of certain  foreign countries on British subjects residing in    those countries  and their dependants, invites each  Government    of the Empire, regard being had to its own particular conditions,    to consider the possibility of adopting in workmen&apos;s compensation    legislation, the  principle  of reciprocity, that is,  that the benefits    of such legislation  should be  accorded to  subjects of foreign    countries upon  the condition  that and  to the  extent to which    such  foreign countries accord reciprocal treatment to British    subjects.&quot;    The  Conference notes in  adopting  the  foregoing  Resolutionsthat, in  certain of  the Dominions, Workmen&apos;s  Conpensation  fallswholly or partially within Provincial or State jurisdiction and isin those cases and to that extent outside the control of the dominion government.           8.  IMPERIAL ECONOMIC  COMMITTEE.    It was decided to adopt the following Eesolution :        &apos;&apos; That in the  opinion of this Imperial Economic Conference    (Canada dissenting)^-    &quot;(10 It is desirable to establish an  Imperial  Economic  Com-         committee, comprising representatives of the Governments         represented in the Imperial Conference,  and responsible         to those Governments.  -  &quot; (2.) The function of the Committee  should be to consider and         advise upon any matters  of an economic or  commercial         character, not  being matters appropriate  to be dealt with         by the Imperial Shipping Committee, which are referred         to it  by  any of the constituent  Governments, provided         that no question which has any reference to another part         of the Empire  may be referred  to the Committee  without         the consent of that other part of the Empire.&quot;
  It wag further  decided  that in the constitution  of the proposed   (j 1Imperial Economic Committee representation should be  allotted to     &quot;&apos;* 1the various constituent Governments as follows :         Great Britain    ..........   4 members.
