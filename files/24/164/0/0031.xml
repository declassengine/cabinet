1. General^Gons 1 derat io ns,                              2 4 9         Foot-and-Mouth Disease .ia permanently established  in central Europe and the East, it appears in Great Britain (as inthe Scandinavian Countries) as sporadic outbreaks carried fromwithout.   These initial outbreaks occur irregularly andunexpectedly whenever there is much disease on the continent and no particular carrier Ms been detected, though it is significant that more than one-half of the cases have occurred in the counties bordering on the seaboard from Norfolk to SussexIf an Initial outbreak is quickly detected and reported the spread of the disease is readily stamped out, but occasionallya market or some stream of communication becomes contaminatedwhereupon a wholesale Infection of farms takes place aridsomething in the nature of an epidemic is produced locally,owing to the extremely contagious nature of the disease.   Thevery serious outbreak of early 1922 was due to the infectionof Newcastle, Market and again the current outbreak in Cheshire,Shropshire etc., all arose from a single case which contaminateda railway dock at Crewe.         The most disturbing feature tos been the great increaseof initial outbreaks since the war as shown by the following figures: -               Initial Outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease.                 1908      1                1916       1                 1909      -                1917                 1910      1                1918       1                 1911      6                1919      14                 1912     12                1920      27                 1913      2                1921       8                 1914      7                1922       5                 1915      1                1923   50 - 60*         Thls points to the introduction of the disease throughcommunication by some article of importation&apos;which was excludedduring the war but has besn imported since in Increasing volume.The Ministry&apos;s enquiries and experiments have as yet failed to fix upon this unknown source.* This figure results  from a first  survey  and. may be subject    to some  slight  reduction on further  investigation.1.
          Slaughter ae a policy of dealing with outbreaks ofPoot-and-Mouth Disease is adopted by the U.8.A. and byScandinavian countries, which are subject to sporadic attackslike our 6wn.   The Middle European countries in which.the disease is more or less endemic adopt a policy of isolation onthe grounds that the extent of slaughter ^ould be too great andthat they cannot protect their long land frontiers fromre-invasion.   Within the last few days, however, a veterinaryconference in Switzerland where the disease had of recent years been severe and where a most drastic policy of isolation hasbeen attempted has decided that recourse must be load to aslaughter policy.2* ft&apos;esent Visitation.          *is regards the present attack the extent of the diseasereached its height during December&apos;when 1,261 outbreaks onseparate farms were declared.   The position has .progressivelyimproved during January as shown by the statement attachedshowing the outbreaks declared each week.   The total number ofnew premises infected during the two weeks ended 2nd February1924 is 112 and of these 52 were confined to the Cheshire Area.In Scotland only threo fresh farms, have become infected duringthe past fortnight, all in Lanarkshire.          One new centre of disease has appeared outsideexisting Infected -rtreas since the 14th January, namely, inMiddlesex, where  three farms and one slaughterhouse have becomeinfected.   These are all connected cases, but the origin is not definitely established though probably due to infection having be&apos;carried from the Midlands.          S&quot;ince the commencement of the present series of caseson the 27th August, 1923, the number of infected premisesdeclared, the number of animals slaughtered and the expenditure incurred has amounted to

The financial arrangements are governed by the diseases of Animals Act, 1894, which provides in Section 15 (5)that,the compensation for slaughtered animals should be paid out of the Cattle Pleuro-i-neumonla Account for Great Britain.Section 18 of the Act provides for the payment into the Accountof such moneys (not exceeding  140,000 in any one year) as maybe provided by Parliament and that if in any financial year themoney standing to the Account is insufficient to meet the liabilities the difference shall be made up out of the local taxation Account and the Local Taxation (Scotland) Account inthe proportion of 88 and 12 per cent,  respectively.  Includedin the maximum grants of  140,000 for  Great Britain,  and, underSection 73,  20,000 for Ireland, are sums up to  50,000 forSwine Pever.  Great Britain&apos;s share of the Swine Fever ^rantamounts approximately to  40,000, so that the amount  availablefor foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain is limited to 100,000 a year.
                                                              hi tlhl          In view of the heavy expenditure in respect of thepresent visitation, the adoption of the normal procedure would throw a very heavy burden on local rates.   The late government decided, therefore, to ask Parliament for authority to pay thebulk of the cost out of national funds and that the contribution of local authorities should be limited to the amount by which that part of the Estate Duty Grant for this year, which is payableinto the Local Taxation. Account exceeds tho average of thecorresponding receipts for the preceding 5 years after excluding the  payments in those 5 years into the Cattle Pleuro-PneumoniaAccount.   The object of this arrangement ia to secure that thesum available to local authorities out of the Local TaxationAccount for purposes other than expenditure on diseases of animalsshall be equal to the average annual sum available for those purposes during the last 5 years.   .Arrangements have been madefor the introduction of a Bill to remove temporarily the limit of 140,000 for cattle diseases imposed by the Diseases of AnimalsAct 1894 and for the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate inrespect of the contribution from national funds.Cheshire.          The heaviest losses have fallen upon Cheshire, whereabout 48,700 cattle, including about 39,000 cows, or nearly 52%of the cow population of that county,  have been slaughtered.With a view to saving cows in this county as far as is practicablewithout incurring an undue risk of the spread of infection,  theMinistry has agree-d to substitute isolation for slaughter ofaffected dairy stock in cases where tho buildings and othersurrounding circumstances are suitable for the purpose.  ,Twenty-four infected premises in the Cheshire Area have now been dealtwith in this,.manner.
11                                                           9 F Q    Restrictions.    Restrictions are maintained over all  &amp;* t)Areas infected, covering a radius of 15 miles, generally speaking,from every infected farm in the first instance, this areabeing reduced as the disease position admits.  There are 12separate infected Areas in England and Wales and 5 in Scotland.           No movement of animals is allowed.out of these Areasinto free areas, but movement of fat stock is permitted fromone fire8 to a slaughterhouse In another.  Movement into theInfected Areas from free Areas and within each Area is permitted by licence subject to the proviso that no licence may be granted for movements from or to premises within 2 miles of an infectedPlace and that the animals, moved are detained at their destination for 28 days unless intended for slaughter orbreeding.  Licensed markets for fat stock and displenishingfarm sales only are allowed In Infected Areas (except within 5                                                                 1miles of an. Infected farm) and these markets and sales are       ;subject to veterinary inspection,  in the Cheshire Ares,however, no movements of animals are permitted except by licenceof the Ministry1s inspectors for emergency purposes and allmarkets and sales of stock are prohibited.              Hunting is prohibited for the time being in allinfected Areas.               All Areas are kept watched continually and arecontracted (or extended) as the disease position may warrant orr s quire.                                                                 i  5. RESEARCH.              Prior to 1920 no investigation into Foot andMouth disease was sanctioned in this country because of thedanger of establishing a centre of so infectious a disease.              in 1912 a Commission was despatched to India with instructions to begin such investigation of the origin*endmeans of transmission of the disease as could not be safelyundert^kgn here,  This Commission found itsolf unable to make
any satisfactory progress owing to the -universal prevalence of the disease in a mild form, so that animals for experimentcould not be found that were either free from the disease ornot to some extent immunised.          In 1920 Lord Lee appointed a Committee under theChairmanship of Professor Muir of Glasgow to conductinvestigations in the first instance Into the viability and artificial cultivation of the virus.  The Committee established a laboratory on an obsolete warship, anchored off Harwichwith two attendant lightens for the accommodation of animals.After some seven months1  investigation the Committee came tothe conclusion that their work could not profitably be carriedon under the conditions imposed by life on shipboard.  Thenumber of animals available for test were tbo limited.  great difficulties were met with in maintaining a supply of virus,since outbreaks in England were infrequent at the time rndalso since infective material transmitted by post with everyprecaution lost its virulence&quot; in the most unexpected fashion.The pathologists in charge failed to discover within the periodany method of cultivating the virus outside the animal.  TheCommittee concluded that their work had better be suspendedunless it could be continued on a much larger scale and on land -preferably on an island.  The cost of this inquiry amountedto approximately  13,000.          During the present outbreak Sir Stewart Stockmanobtained permission to institute some experiments at the RoyalVeterinary College In Camden Town, with the hope of gettingmore light on the possibility of the transmission of the diseaseby means of meat and other products of diseased animals.  Itwas considered that no spread was likely to follow even thoughan animal should foil with the disease on the Camden Townpremises, and these experiments  are still in progress and haveyielded some positive results.  Further the Chief VeterinaryOfficer Is carrying out some feeding experiments on animalsconfined 0n the Minis try&apos;.s premises at Pirbright on the chance
                                                           J J                                          &apos;          &apos;         A&apos;of finding some imported material that may be carrying disease.        In accordance with the Resolution of the cabinetCommittee on December 11th Sir Robert Sanders consulted Sirwaiter Fletcher of the Medical Research Council in order tocall upon some eminent scientific man to review the procedure adopted by the Ministry and to report upon the possibilitiesof research.  On Sir Falter Fletcher&apos;s recommendation sir william Leishman was invited and is now engaged in theconsidoration of the material facts supplied to him by theChief Veterinary Officer.         It should be understood that the disease has for manyyears been the subject of continuous and organised investigation by the highly efficient veterinary staffs of countries likeFrance, Germany, Switzerland and Holland, in which the diseaseis endemic.  The greatest difficulties h-ve been met in thework due to the fact that the virus of Foot arid Mouth Diseaseis one of the ultra-microscopic-, filter-passing organisms andthe technique for dealing with such is still very imperfect.So far their investigations have proved of no avail, either tocultivate the organism  outside the animal, or to find a vaccineor serum which will confer immunity.  A German investigatorwithin the last two days, claims to have obtained a method ofcultivating the virus.  He has been communicated with and hasobtained the permission of his Government to discuss the matter with a British representative, with the result that one of theMinistry&apos;s officers specially conversant with research is being dispatched to Berlin.7.
