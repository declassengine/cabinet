1,    The present position of French debt to this  countryis as follows :-      (a)  The debt amounts to  611,871,000, against  which 53,000,000 gold was deposited with us and used for payments in America.   The actual cost to thGf British taxpayer ofthe cash lent to France, making full allowance for the gold,is very close to 330 millions a year,      (b)  The debt is represented by 12 months FrenchTreasury Bills expressed in sterling (in the form annexed).As they fall due in blocks month by month the Bills arereplaced by new Bills discounted at bank rate.     ith bank rate at &amp;% as at present, France could clear herself  of any interest charge by a payment of  22 millions per annum.2.   Under the original agreements the advancers wererenewable only up to 3 years after the conclusion of  Peace.The original intention was that the bills should be redeemed by mean of French starling loans to be raised on the Iondon market as soon as conditions for such loanswere suitable.   Such conditions at any rate for an operation on a moderate scale undoubtedly existed in  theearly summer of 1922, as shewn by the suocesf? of the  SeineDepartment loan and the French Railway loans in thiscountry and Great Britain has a legitimate ground of  complaint that not even the most modest effort was made by the  FrenchGovernment, if only as evidence of en intention on thepart of France to do her best to meet her obligations.       In the Balfour Tote (1st -August:, 1922) the BritishGovernment were &quot;regretfully constrained to.request theFrench Government to make arrangements for dealing to the                                                  best

But wehave not hitherto refused to renew the Bills as they felldue,3.    The French Government have repeatedly stated thatthey cannot be expected to make any payment to the UnitedKingdom or the U.S.A. until they have received reparationfrom germany          This statement,  while it may represent in the eyes  ofFrance a moral principle,  has no foundation either in theory or in fact.      The French Treasury Bills (as explained in the annexe to the British Hote of August 1923) arepurely unconditional obligations to pay and neither arenor in view of the dates at which the advances were madecould have been conditional on the receipt by France of reparations.    The French Budget position and balance oftrade would certainly permit some paymentsif not to thefull extent of the annual interest due to the U.K.  andU.S.A., yet a substantial part thereof.     This is moreoverdemonstrated by France&apos;s willingness to make externalloans for political purposes.     She has advanced orguaranteed 400 million  francs to Belgium (September 1923)and 150 millions to Morocco (June 1923)*       The Chamberof Deputies has authorised advances of 800 millions to the little Entente, which according to apparently well founded reports may be increased to 1,200 millions.    these would total 1,750 millions, or over  20,000,.000.-,     Apartfrom this we have reports of a contemplated vary largeadvance ( 5,000,000) to Greece for naval purposes.         It will be remembered that the British taxpayer(representing British industry and commerce) JS actuallypaying interest on the French debts to us,  though France is far more lightly taxed than he is, and though by her policy                                             &apos;       in
in the Ruhr she is depriving him of Reparation andpoBsibly ultimately relieving his German competitor ofan equivalent &quot;burden.4.   If it were decided that pressure should he put uponFrance to pay - either as a very welcome relief to theBritish taxpayer or as a lever to bring about a more reasonable attitude on Reparations, there is a preliminarypoint to be considered, i.e. whether we should attemptdirect co-operation with the U.S.A.      It is possible thatan official advance would not be very welcome to the U.S.A.in spite of rumours that the Debt Funding Commission isitself about to approach European debtors.     But therewould be a good deal to be said  for a private offer to exchange ideas informally with a view to arranging if possibleto co-ordinate our efforts with  theirs  in point of timeand, to some extent also, in point of method.5,   The only thing likely to move the  present FrenchGovernment towards a more reasonable Reparation policy,apart from a slowly growing feeling of  disquiet at Frenchisolation amid the reprobation of a world horrified atstarvation and ruin in Germany,  is a fall in  the Frenchfranc sufficiently serious to shake the confidence of theFrench peasant in his national securities.    A lively fearof this result would make the French Government verysusceptible  to pressure.   Is it in the power of thiscountry to produce such a fear?    The  Treasury would say,most certainly,6.   So far France has always shied at  the word &quot;repudiation&quot;.If she was asked  to make some payment on her Bills she could hardly refuse without  openly admitting  that she was                                               -repudiating
Q n P  U yrepudiating with all the consequences to her pride andcreditj     No doubt a brusque refusal to renew (i. e.  ademand for immediate payment of over  600 millions;) wouldseem to the world unreasonable;   but France could quite wellbe asked to fund her debts on terras including cash paymentof interest..     She would then either have to damage hercredit by refusal or face the burden of a payment which she might have largely escaped if she had accepted the British proposal for a settlement in January, 1923*   It must beremembered that France has got accustomed to the idea thather debts will somehow be written bff .    A definite demand to fund,(following uneasy motions in the same direction inAmerica) would in itself (while in no way precluding ultima/teremission when there is a complete reparation settlement) bea recall to the world of realities and tend to ,put the nowovervalued franc at its proper level.7.   The procedure might be  :-     (1) An invitation to enter into funding arrangements,either to France alone, or,  if it were thought, better, toall debtor allies simultaneously, with a private notificationto Italy and the minor Allies that we should be prepared tohave full regard to their financial difficulties, and give them very liberal terms.      (2) &quot;Sanctions&quot;, in the event of the invitation beingde&amp;lined or of refusal to aeoept reasonable funding terms:-      (a) application of gold deposits to payment of  interest          on maturing bills until these are exhausted.          We have already made it clear that we are not          prepared to refund the gold until all French debts          are paid (i.e, never).   But public application of          this fSBum to interest /would mean that the Bank of          France would have to take the  53 millions  out of          their Return (where they still figure),    This          would seriously compromJso their proportion of          reserves and therefore the:; r credit,   There is no          doubt that the French Government would be exceedingly          unwilling to face this measure:                                                   (b)

The French having ex hycothesi    refused to meet the Bills, the sale price would    naturally he very low and this Very  act would    destroy French credit Ln most of the world markets.    This in turn would react on the franc and on    French internal credit:(o)  in certain circumstances it is conceivable that    we aight exchange French Bills for Gorman Bonds.    The German Government could theft tender the    French Bills in payment for Separation.   The    Frenoh could hardly repudiate their own Bills    nhen so tendered.(?) if fiurther steps were needed (rhioh is not    probable) there is much to be said for legislation    empowering the Treasury to make a levy on imports    from defaulting debtor countries on the lines of    the Reparation Recovery Act.8.   The effect of  those measures would be so to damageFrench credit that  French private firms and seni-publiobodies would not in practice bo able to borrow in england in the normal course of business except within exceedinglyrestricted limits.   Very few people would lend if the franc was 120 and depreciating rapidly.   It would hardly be necessary to go  to suoh drastic lengths as passinglegislation to prohibit raising of loans directly or indirectlyin Enjlend on behalf of Governments indebted to the BritishGovernment which might have unfunded SoLts outstanding,except with the specific sanction of the Treasury and on condition that a part of the proceeds wero applied towardsthe payment of those debts.9.

It is ty rib beans improbable that the  threat alone tiould  be quite sufficient.    But it sOecie necessary  to envisage  what could te done if necessary. 11.  It. is not proposed to elatorate  here what night te the  terms on which we should fund Allied DoVcs.     Bat  two general  comments nay perhaps te nafie : -     (1)  Broadly speaking, we oannot  ask from  Fr.--.nco more onerous  terns than wo have ourselves  ottained  from the U.S.A. tut,  apart  from  tho Ruhr folly,  there is nothing in her economic1  and financial  position to justify the grant of more favourable torns.   SoV-ie spooial conce&amp;sion night te needed in the earlier part of  the funding operations,  say,  for the first 5 years, or  until the  franc-sterling eschango  has teen statlo..for two consecutive years.   This concession  night take the  form of accepting a very low  ate of  interest  orundertaking  to re-invest tho interest in France during  thisperiods     (2)  Italy f-nd  the  ninor Deters  could te  given  very favourable terns indeed in exchange for  political undertakings which would  probably  not te  very irksome to then,  tut which$rsjaoa would be very  unlikely to accept,  e.g.  Italy  might beasked to  ngrao to  abstain from  any coercive measures against es-enomy  countries not  unanimously approved by all theAllies,  and  not until the  British  debt has toon paid to makeor to allow  to to  floated on the Italian market loans to any foreign Bowers,  escort  for purposes jointly approved ty theItalian and British Governments.12.  The  general conclusion  of  the Treasury may &quot;bo summed upty saying that tho existence  of  short term French  debts could
be raa&amp;o .? very potent lever bo bring about conditionslikely to incline France; in order to avoid most serious financial difflenities, to a general settlement of reparations,provided His ilnjesty*ts Government woro propsrod t6 use thislevor resolutely.   It vould bo essential that theFrench Government should believe that Grer-t Britain reallymeant business.
