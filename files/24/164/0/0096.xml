[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.^ g ^               Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1924.CONFIDENTIAL.MEMORANDUM RESPECTING  THE  BOXER  INDEMNITY BILL.     AFTER the Boxer rising of 1900 the Chinese Government were called upon topay an indemnity to the Powers concerned for damage sustained and military expenditure  incurred.  The total amount  was fixed  at  450,000,000  taels, or 67,500,000.  The British share of this total was 50,620,545 taels, or  7,593,081  15s.This debt was to bear interest at 4 per cent,  per annum, and was to be redeemed in annual instalments spread over thirty-nine years, terminating in 1940.     The British claim, unlike the claims of several other Powers, was assessed withcare and moderation, and the payments were applied, by the Finance Act of 1906 tothe reduction of national debt, this use being supported by the fact that the moneyrepresented repayment of expenditure originally met from the proceeds  of debtcreated for the purpose.     In  1908 the United States Government,  who,  in  contradistinction  to  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government,  had  overestimated their  losses during the Boxer  rising,voluntarily reduced their share of the indemnity  by about half, and in return theChinese Government guaranteed  that the money  thus remitted should be  used toeducate Chinese students in the. United States of America.     This &quot; generosity &quot;  on the part of the United States-Government had such anadmirable propaganda effect that it gave rise to an increasing demand on the part ofBritish interests connected with China that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take similar steps to remit the whole or part of their indemnity.     The question arose again in a different form in 1917.  The war was in progress,and every effort was being made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to persuade China tojoin the Allies.  Among other concessions, His Majesty&apos;s Government were preparedto remit the whole balance of their indemnity, but other Allies did  not concur,  and finally it was agreed in February 1918 to suspend payment of the indemnity for fiveyears.  No payments were therefore made to Great Britain from 1917 to 1922, butthe suspended payments  are to fall due from 1940 to  1945.     At the end of 1922 the question of resuming the suspended payments had to bedecided.  Thev whole position had changed since 1917.  Germany and Austria hadforfeited their shares; payments of the Russian share had ceased; the United Statesof America were, about to remit their remaining balance; France was preparing to utilise her share partly for the resuscitation of the Banque industrielle de Chine andpartly for the education of Chinese in France; and  the Japanese Government had decided to  allocate their indemnity for cultural purposes in China. Belgium andItaly and certain minor  Powers do not seem to contemplate any remission of theirpayments; but 80 per cent, of the total original indemnity had thus been returned inone way or other to the Chinese.   It was impossible  for Great Britain, alone of theimportant Treaty Powers, to continue to appropriate her indemnity for her own purposes.    Accordingly, with the concurrence of the Treasury, His Majesty&apos;s representa-tive  at  Peking informed  the  Chinese Minister  for Foreign  Affairs on  the20th December, 1922, that His Majesty&apos;s Government  had decided  in principle to.devote the proceeds of  the Boxer indemnity to purposes mutually beneficial to Chinaand Great Britain.     This notification was received with great satisfaction both in China and in thiscountry, and numerous suggestions as to the utilisation of the  funds have beenreceived from the Far East and  from many  parts of the  British Empire.  It wasdecided that it would be unwise to &quot; remit&quot;&quot; the money, in the sense of  handing itover to the Chinese for their uncontrolled use.  The money is to be at the disposal ofHis Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs  for such purposes as are in hisopinion mutually beneficial to British and Chinese interests.  For this diversion of      1987  [11199]
the funds from the purposes laid down under the Finance Act of 1906 legislation isnecessary, and a draft  Bill (see  Annex) has  accordingly been prepared  by theParliamentary Counsel in consultation with the Foreign Office.    The balance of the indemnity (principal and interest) amounts to  11,186,547-payments being spread over twenty-three years from 1923 to 1945.   Payments havebeen resumed,  and are  being deposited in a  British  bank at Shanghai pendingdecision as to their utilisation.    Legislation has been delayed by political events, but it is desirable that it should now be proceeded with.    As soon as the passing of the  Bill  is assured, it is  proposed to appoint  acommittee to investigate the allocation of the funds and the best means of securing their satisfactory administration.    Foreign Office, February 2,  1924.                                             ANNEX..A.D. 1923.
