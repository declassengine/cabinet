riORUMEMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  PAJ53TY;S GOVERNMENT.   Memorandum by  the President of the Board of Trade.     I desire the authority of the  Cabinet  to publish anOrder for the taking in 1925 of a Census  of Production forthe year 1924.     Unless an order is laid forthwith,  the possibilityof taking a census covering the year 1924 is lost.    Inmy opinion such a census should be  taken.   It  would ofcourse be possible for  our successors to revoke the  order;but it would not be possible for them to make an ordercovering.1924 or to procure a census in  respect of thatyear unless we lay an order now.     I attach a note ,giving some of the reasons in  supportof a Census.CAB I N E T.SECRET.CP. 14 (24)CENSUS OF PRODUCTION.P. Ll-G.8.1,24.Board of Trade.
                                                  Iff     The first Census of Production furnished,  for  thefirst time, a complete survey of the industrial productionof the United Kingdom.   The figures related to 1907 andthe Second Census, relating to 1912, was not completed,owing to the interruption in work caused by the War.The very considerable changes caused by the War make the1907 data of relatively little value in relation to manypresent problems, and a new survey is needed to furnishinformation as to the post-war position.   As prices have,on the average, maintained a tolerably stable position for over a year, the present is a suitable time for establishing a new datum line from which to measurepr ogr es s.     In view of the fact that arguments of considerable importance are being based on a belief that the intensity of production has been greatly increased, it is of fundamental Importance to cletermine in what degree  thishas been the case, or whether the production per personengaged has, in fact, decreased.     The relation of  our foreign trade to our home production, and other important features of our economic structure, need to*be redetermined after the changes ofthe  last decade.     In  the United States, a  census of manufactures istaken  at intervals of five years, in Canada and also inAustralia, New Zealand and South Africa, yearly surveysare  now  made.   It is of importance that we should  be ableto compare our relative position at brief intervals.     A Census  of  Production furnishes the least uncertainbasis  on which  an  estimate of National Income can beprepared,  and such an estimate, especially one showing
different branches of industry contribute,  is  of  greatutility in determining important questions  of  national policy, e.g. with reference to taxation.     The real effects of the price changes  since  the Hfar,especially as different groups of products  have beendifferently affected, and existing index figures  of movement are necessarily based mainly on information relating to crude or slightly prepared products,  can only he determined when the quantities and values of themore important classes of commodities produced in thiscountry are ascertained^     The experience of the earlier work will enable thematerial of a new Census to be so grouped as to furnishimportant information concerning the relation of  the size of the productive unit to the product, and to the .distribution of output in different industries betweenbusinesses under private and under corporate control.Such information should be of much value in consideringmany financial and social problems.
