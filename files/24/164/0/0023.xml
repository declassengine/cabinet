D00UI.13SI IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AMI 0 MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.ttBRITISH DYESTUFFS AGREEMENT.        Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     In aooordanoe with the request of the Cabinet Icirculate the following note on the present position under the Dyes Act and the negotiations and agreemententered into with tho German Dye-makers,     Ever since the then Government (in 1920) agreedto put the Dyes Act-through it has been understood that every effort would be made to secure the co-operation ofthe German dye-makers in the dye industry in this/country.That was plainly stated to the British Dyestuffs Corporationbefore the Aot was passed; and it has been the consistentpolicy of the Board of Trade ever since.   It was realizedand universally agreed that, if English chemists were towork to the best advantage and the industry mas to havea real chance of developing during the period of the Act,it was essential to obtain the unique knowledge and experience of the German industry,-&apos;     For the past eighteen months negotiations have been         * -                        aundertaken from, time to time with the German dye-makere;and at the outset the Foreign Office have instructed the British Ambassador in Berlin to use every opportunityof pressing a successful issue of these negotiationsupon the German Government.     In the meantime the Dyes Act has been administoredby a Statutory Liconsing Committee upon which the ColourUsers have five representatives and the Dyomakers three,the remaining members being three independent members
:of whom one is Chairman.   The  colour  users, whofor the most part are genuinely desirous  to  see thedye industry established in  this country, have alwayscontended that the textilo industries  must be ableto obtain the most efficient dyes and  be  able toobtain those dyes at prices  similar  to those paid bytheir foreign competitors.     There has been no substantial dispute on the licensing Committee on the question  of quality.Licences have always been granted where the quality of British dyes was below that  of foreign makers;and the British makers have been steadily increasingthe range of their production.   Price,  on the other hand,has been a very difficult question throughout; and ithas been increasingly difficult  to hold the Committeetogether.   Many applications have been made to theCommittee on the- ground that the Gorman price is much lower than the British.  This is an undoubted fact.An artificial arrangement has been adopted giving theBritish makers a right to supply where their price doesnot exceed three times the pro-war German price..Prices based on a three-times factor are much higherthan the price at which the German makers are preparedto sell heref-but in the absence of an agreement theBritish rakers could not continue in business without such a protection.  Indeed, the  British makers withtheir limited experience and range of  production find it difficult in many cases to bring  their prices downeven to this factor.
     The  consumers,on the  other hand,  have protested with increasingvehemence against  the maintenance of this condition,  Without suchan arrangement with the  German makers  as lias recently been concludedit would  be  impossible to  hold the Committee together or to maintainthe operation of tho Act and the existence of the industry in thiscountry.   In the absence of an agreement one of two things musthappen.   Either  licences will he given,  where German prices are lower than British prices, in which case the British dyemakers couldnot carry on their business and the British Dyestuffs corporation would be  wound up.  Or,  if licences were refused on the ground of price, the users would resign from the Licensing Committee.  Thiswould break  the  Committee  and the Act,  The administration of theAct is founded upon and lias always been justified by agreementbetween the  users  and producers.     The  open and  active opposition of a strong body of users has only been withheld by the  knowledge of their leaders of the purpose and course of the  German negotiations,&quot;  One of the most influentialof their leaders (the Chairman of the Calico printers1 Association)has himself  taken part in  the negotiations with the German makers,and the Chairman of the Colour Users&quot; Association has been in the closest touch with the British Dyestuffs Corporation and with theBoard of Trade.      The agreement which has been reached between the British Dye- stuffs Corporation and the German Dye hakers is set out in the Appendix to this Memorandum.  The Agreement provides that for 50 years the German Dye  Makers shall place at  the disposal of the British Dye- stuffs Corporation all their patents, Information, knowledge and experience.  The German makers will cease to compete in the United kingdom; and business in other parts  of the British Empire ^and in China is to be divided in agreed quotas.  The British Dyestuffs Corporation estimate  that  this will give them twice their present output.  The British Dyestuffs Corporation are to retain for their 07m company the first  200,000 of profit yearly for five years, and thereafter  the first   150,000 of profit  yearly.  Profits above these Figures  are to be divided equally between the British Dyestuffs forporation and the German Makers.      ^is Agreement  is much more favourable than
i w 0x TS&apos; O , than  the Agreement which,  the  Company inform me,  the French&apos;Iakers with  the approval of  their Government,  have concluded with the Germans.  Under the French Agreement the Frenoh are confined entirely to the French marks    they  have to pay 16f million. gold francs as a capital sum spread  over a period of ten years and in addition the French agree  to  pay half their profits to the German Lakors without any  deduction.     The Agreement is strongly  supported by the Government Directors one of whom is Lord Ashfield,  a past-President  of the  Board of Trade and by Mr. &quot;MoKonna, who has given unswerving support to  the establishment of the industry  in  this  country,,     Even if it were possible  to  assume a condition of affairs in which future Governments would  unconditionally  maintain  the Dyes Act, I, in common with my  predecessors,  should  most strongly urge the adoption of this  agreement  as  the  one  effective  way  of establishing the industry  in this country,   In  present conditions, with the certainty of the  opposition of all  the users  if  such  an agreement is not concluded, with  a Government in  powor whioh  is more or less pledgod against any protective  measures,  it  appears to me to bo madness to forego  the benefits  of this  agreement. I think it is certain that no such agreement could  be  made  again; indeed, the Chairman of the Company informs  me  that the German representatives who are here at the present  time  say that a number of their members are extremely oritioal  of their having made such an arrangement,  when, as events have  turned  out,  a Labour or Liberal Government is likely  to come  into office, under whose regime the Germans could  have acquired the  English  market without any arrangement,     If the agreement is not oarried out, and in  the absence  of aI guarantee of a very large  yearly  subsidy, which is  quite  impossible; the Directors of the British Dyestuffs  Corporation  would  almost certainly be forcod to wind up  the Company,  which at the  moment has
sufficient asssts to pay preference shareholders in full and toprovide something for the other shareholders.     In these circumstances, I would urge the Government as strongly as I can to approve the results of a line of policywhich has been the chief aim of the Government and the industryin this matter ever sinoe the Dyestuffs let was passed.     I should add that there is an outstanding question offinance which possibly the Chancellor of the Exchequer may wishto raise.   It is necessary to write down the capital of theBritish Company, whioh is at present over-capitallsod.  It isproposed that the preference shareholders should be satisfiedpartly in cash and partly by an allotment of ordinary shares;and it is proposed that the Government should reoeive thowhole of its consideration in shares.     In my opinion this is a reasonable proposal and one whichwill insure that the Company retains sufficient working capital.                                       (Intld) P.
