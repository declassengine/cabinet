Slaughter: Poll off.:     1.   Ihe Committee were informed, that the net expenditureof  1,500,000 authorised at the last meeting had already beenexceeded.  The estimated gross compensation to date was 1,846,000.  In  addition miscellaneous expenses amounted toabout  200,000.   he estimated receipts from salvage of healthyearcases amounted to  271,000, so that the estimated net expenditure to date was about  1,775,000.     2,   Tine area which gave most cause for anxiety was Cheshireand Shropshire, where outbreaks were occurring at the rate ofabout 30 a day.  In this area the opinion of the majority of farmers was against slaughter and farmers had threatened to resist that policy.  It was pointed out to the Committee that without the goodwill and co-operation of the farmers concerned,the slaughter policy could not possibly succeed and the moneyspent would be wasted.  It was a question for consideration,therefore, whether in this   area the policy of slaughter shouldbe discontinued  in favour of a policy of isolation, the slaughterpolicy being continued in other parts of the country.     3,   The Committee decided:-          Ifi-o recommend to the Cabinet that the-present          policy of slaughter should be continued for          another fortnight unless the veterinary          advisers of the Ministry of Agriculture were          of opinion that, owing to the resistance of          farmers in the Cheshire and Shropshire area,          it would be Impossible to tiarry out the slaughter          policy  successfully in that area.Finance.     5.   the Committee had under consideration a memorandum by,the Secretary for Scotland (C.F..M.1, copy annexed) urging that,in view of the  serious growth of the compensation charge inconnection with  the present outbreak of foot and mouth di sease,the whole cost  of the present outbreak and all future expenditure&apos;of tho kind should he provided.by the Exchequer.
fthe Committee decided;-(a)   To reverse the decision at their previous      meeting that the Local Taxation Account should      he recouped by an Exchequer Grant to the      extent of half the net expenditure in      connection vrt-th foot and uouth disease.lb)   f&apos;o recommend to the Cabinet that the whole of      the expenditure incurred by the Ministry of      Agricnaitu.ro during the present financial year      in combating foot and mouth disease should be      defrayed out of the Exchequer.

-SHIS DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROiE RTY OP  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTfS  GOVERNMENT *SECRET.&apos; C.P.M.1.COPY Mo.6 A B I NET.    GOMMITTEE OH FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE.( MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY POR SCOTLAND ).          The serious growth of the compensation charge inconnection with the present outbreak of foot and mouth diseasecompels me to raise the question whether continuance of thepolicy of charging half of the compensation to the local TaxationAccounts, - i.e,, in effect, to the local rates, - is justified.          There is no express provision in the Diseases of animals Act, 1894, authorising this equal division of the chargebetween the Exchequer and the &quot;local rates.  If equal division hand been intended, it may reasonably be expected that the Actwould have said so.  The regulations appended to the Act appearto contemplate that recourse should be had to the Local TaxationAccounts for assistance in an emergency - l.e., when an unfor-e-seen deficiency arose on the Cattle Fleuro-Rieuraonia Account.But they appear also to have contemplated - and they, in fact,provide - that future surpluses on the latter Account may heapplied in repayment of sums previously advanced from the local taxation Accounts.  No such repayments have ever been made.          The Act of 1894 provided that a,sum not exceeding 140,000 should be voted annually for the service of the CattlePleuro-Pheumonia Account.  In the 27 years preceding the lastserious outbreak (1894-1921) the votes for this purpose aggregated 1,340,000, - or an annual average of  50,000 as against thestatutory lip.it of  140,000.  In the same period the drafts onthe Local Taxation Accounts aggregated  1,320..100 (including 158,412 from Scotland) this total being practically equal tothe amount of the Votes.  If the annual Votes had averaged 100,000 - a figure well within the  140,000 for which Section ISof the Act authorises a Vote to be taken, - no drafts on theLocal Taxation Accounts would have been necessary, or, at anyrate, any emergency drafts called for could have been repaid.          The Minister of Agriculture is here carrying out aNational Policy, and this should, it seems to me,&quot;be whollyfinanced from National I?unds.  Thus provided for - the cost would fall more equitably, taxation being levied more in accordancewith ability than local rates.  The Royal Commission on local taxation (1901) recommended that the ihole of this expenditure should be borne by Exchequer, and the Departmental Committee on local Taxation 119M) endorsed this view.          Even if the compensation payable in connection withthe present outbreak does not exceed  1,500*000 - the local taxation iScotland) Account will - according to past practice -
be asked to provide  90,000.  This charge has to bedebited against a stereotyped grant of 1,218,000 a, yeardistributed in aid of local rates.  It will be obviousthat so serious an inroad on the grant must b e  verydisturbing to local authority budgets.          In my opinion the whole cost of the presentoutbreak, and all future expenditure of the kind, shouldbe provided by the Exchequer, and I suggest that the CabinetCommittee should make a recommendation&quot;to this effect, &apos;                            *MDVAK\Scottish Office,   Whitehall, S.W.I.29th December, 1925,
