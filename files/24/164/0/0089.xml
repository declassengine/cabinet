ITHIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.]CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 88 (24).CABINET.THE  USE  OF AIRCRAFT  IN  IRAQ  IN  SUPPORT OF  THE  CIVIL                               POWER.         MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR  THE COLONIES.    IN  connection with the paper circulated by the Secretary of State for Airregarding the use of  aircraft in Iraq in support of the  civil power, I circulate forthe information of; my colleagues a copy of recent correspondence with Sir HenryDobbs, High Commissioner for Iraq, on the same subject.    My colleagues will observe that, as soon as the matter was  brought to mynotice, I took immediate steps to obtain a full report from the High Commissioner.This report has now been received.                                                                  J. H. T.    Colonial Office, February 7, 1924.    Extract of Despatch from Sir Henry Dobbs, High Commissioner for Iraq,                              January 10, 1924.         *          *          *           *          *          *    7. During all this  period a main factor in the pacification of the country hasbeen the Royal Air Force.  By prompt demonstrations on the first signs of troublecarried out over any area affected, however distant, tribal insubordination has beencalmed  before it could  grow dangerous, and there has been an immense saving of blood and  treasure to the British and Iraq Governments. In earlier times punitivecolumns would  have had to straggle towards their objectives  across  deserts or through difficult  defiles, compelled by the necessities  of their  preparations andmarches to give time for their opponents to gain strength.  But now, almost beforethe would-be rebel has formulated his plans, the droning of the aeroplanes is heardoverhead, and in the majority of cases  their  mere appearance  is &quot;enough.  Thisdomination of the country by aeroplanes has, however, its drawbacks.  In the firstplace, their passage is  so easy that local  officials are apt to ask for their help in circumstances in which police could be more properly used, or sometimes in orderto help themselves out of difficulties caused by mistakes of their own administra-tion.  All  applications  from the Iraq Government for air  actions are thereforescrutinised by me most carefully before I endorse them, and no air  operation iscarried out without a full preliminary report by a British Administrative Inspector.In the second place, a result of such complete  dependence on the aeroplane is thatthe Iraqi  troops  have  never yet been tested.  The funds in the Iraq defence budget  are so limited that  there is no money  for troop movements which are notabsolutely necessary, and the Air Officer Commanding is  unwilling to allow untriedtroops to  risk a defeat whioh  might cause all the unruly elements  in the landsuddenly to flare up.  This  is perhaps the  only really disquieting feature in thepresent  situation.  The British Air Force will be withdrawn in four years&apos; time, ifnot earlier, and, unless the Iraq  Government has before  that  been  permitted andbeen able  to form an efficient  Air  Force  of  its own,,  its Army will find itselfconfronted by the formidable task of keeping order among a population which willknow that the force chiefly  dreaded by it has left  the country.  The Iraq Govern-ment is  fully alive to this danger, and is devoting much  thought to the expansion and training of its Army with the help of British  Military Officers, whose services have been  lent to it. The Air Officer Commanding has expressed his satisfaction      [11210]                                        .
with the appearance and training of the Iraq troops, and if, as now seems probablethe Iraq Government consents to their being trained under the executive command of British  officers, there is  every reason to hope that they will, when the time comes, be strong  enough.   They are supplemented by an admirable  Police force,the only defect of which is the comparative  smallness of its  numbers.         *          *          *          *          *          *Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner                         for Iraq, January 31, 1924.    Accounts of recent air operations on  Euphrates  have appeared in presshere during last few days and have aroused adverse comment.  I have seen sfcate-ments made in  Parliament by late Government on general question of air action.I am as  anxious  as  they  were to do  nothing to  impair  effectiveness of  IraqGovernment  in maintaining order or to-weaken your hands in rendering themnecessary assistance.  But  you will understand  that accounts of these incidents,especially  when  accompanied  by  the  heavy  casualties  inflicted  on  the30th November, produce unfortunate impression here and will not be easy for meto explain or defend in Parliament.   Whole question will be examined by Cabinet,who, you  may be assured, will  deal with it  entirely  on its merits  and withoutprepossession of any kind.   In order that I may lay question fully before them, Ishould be glad to have considered  statement  from you  on whole  subject.   Inparticular I would ask you to consider afresh the possibilities of adopting some alternative policy which would avoid actual resort to bomb-dropping.  Please  let me have your views as fully  and  frankly as possible. THOMAS.Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the                          Colonies, February 2, 1924.(No. 67.   Confidential.)    Your telegram 31st January.    Tract of Beni Hachaim bombed on 30th November was block on Euphrates inDiwaniyah district which had been out of  control of  Turks before British occupa-tion and had not been penetrated by British troops in clearing up operations afterrebellion of 1920. Tribesmen  were extremely well armed and country bristled withforts, there  being altogether  forty-four in  the area of about 40 square miles whichwas actually dealt with. - These forts were held by petty chiefs at perpetual feudwith one another, who blocked the Euphrates with unauthorised dams, preventedirrigation and impoverished the country.   Iraq Government&apos;s writ&apos; did not run in whole ef this&quot; tract and  it  was plague  spot  which might at any time  infectisurrounding population and endanger safety of  railway from  Bagdad to Basra,which runs at  10 miles distance.  Attitude  of its inhabitants was perpetual sign of weakness of  administration to whole Euphrates  area, which has always beenthe Achilles&apos; heel of Iraq.  Local  authorities,  in  agreement with the BritishAdministrative Inspector, Diwaniyah, were urgent that this area should be brought under better control before the reduction of British ground troops by two battalions,which has now been  carried out.  After consultation with Peisal  and Ministry ofInterior,  I personally  visited  Diwaniyah  in  the middle of November 1923 toascertain conditions.  All chiefs of districts came to  see me,.except Beni HachaimChief, who refused to come.   I satisfied  myself, in  consultation with Air OfficerCommanding, that neither  available Mesopotamian Army forces nor police could undertake the task of reducing these tribes to order without grave risk of beingoverwhelmed,  which might  have  brought  about  wide-spread  insurrection ofEuphrates tribes. I  had to choose, therefore, between leaving untouched an island of anarchy which might at  any  time become eruptive or reducing it to order by air action,   vide  Air Officer  Commanding&apos;s  Report  to  Air Ministry  Xo. 505,12th December, 1923.   In  consultation with King Peisal, I decided  on the  latter.Recalcitrant chiefs were formally summoned to attend at Samawah for the purposeof  discussion  with  Mutessarif and  British Administrative Inspector, and werewarned that severe measures would be taken if they did  not obey.  As they.refusedto: come in, their area was severely bombed, casualties being reported ;  thereuponthey made submission and  the  police entered  the area  unmolested and have
demolished 180 forts altogether.  Of these 136 were in an area not actually bombed,but these  could  not have  been destroyed  peacefully but  for  the operations.Tribesmen are now allowing irrigation officers to inspect and are breaking the damwhich ruined irrigation.   Punishment meted out has made administration of thewhole Euphrates  area easier, notably in Nasiriyah.  The casualties amongst -the tribesmen were most regrettable, but were probably much less than would  havebeen the case had the ground troops and guns undertaken the operation.  It mustbe remembered that anarchy and insecurity amongst the tribesmen, due to Govern-ment weakness, leads to far greater loss of human life. For instance, in one recentsmall Shammar raid on a caravan thirty persons were killed, while on occasion ofruiding party of Anizah falling into  ambush by Syrian  tribe thirty-three persons were killed.  Such  incidents would be of almost daily occurrence were it not forthe terror of the Air.  Thus demonstration of the power of the Government whichimposes peace on wide area as this has done saves enormously more  lives than itcosts.   I am fully aware of the disadvantage of trusting solely to Air action whichI have set forth in paragraph 7 of my Confidential despatch of 10th January, 1924,and I am in full agreement with the policy set forth in Air Ministry letter enclosedin your despatch  No. 23, 8th January, 1924.   But in this interval, while  the  local forces have not yet had time to fit themselves for their task of maintaining order and while Imperial  ground troops have been reduced to size which only permitsthem to perform  garrison duty at main centres, we are  obliged  to resort to air action  more than we should otherwise do.  I hope  that this state of affairs will only be temporary and that during the present year we shall be able to depend onIraq forces more and more for maintenance of internal security.  It is essential, inthis country of immense distances and deserts, that  we should retain the power ofstriking swiftly if absolutely necessary at distant outbreaks  which may rapidlybecome  unmanageable if  not immediately suppressed  and may  endanger  small british community here  and success of the whole policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.   There  has been continuous  infiltration  by  desert route from  Syria andAnatolia of  rifles and ammunition of the latest pattern and  the  tribes are  nowarmed with modern weapons  as never before.  It is notable feat for Air Force tokeep order  among people of predatory and insurrectionary instincts  thus armed with the help of only 3,000 British and Indian infantry, 4,000 locally-raised leviesand 6,000 half-trained Arab regulars without any effective  artillery.  The countryis now exceedingly peaceful and I myself and the  British Advisers and Inspectorsare working in complete  harmony with the Iraq Government and. people, amongstwhom, so far as I have been able to ascertain, there has been no criticism of theAir operations against Beni Hachaim. HIGH COMMISSIONER.
