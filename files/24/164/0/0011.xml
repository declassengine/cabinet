CABINET.                          / Q.O.P.U (84).             RECENT MEETING OE THE COUNCIL OFcTHE LEAGUE                           OF NATIONS,       Reply by the Lord Privy Seal, to Memorandum by the Secretary                of State for :Foreign Affairs.            (Previous Papers r Q.j?-,.&apos;48S( 5), t-na p.tP.6-(2.4). .           In a memorandum which he has circulated to the Cabinet    Lord Curzon appears to oharge me with not, having carried out an    arrangement made with him.   That is an unusual charge  for one    colleague to bring against another.   On this occasion  It is, I    think unjustified for the reasons which I will presently give.           On one point, however, I am in agreement with ^pK^g^eign    Secretary.   He speaks of the &quot;anomalous nature of  the  conditions    under which the work of our representatives at the  League    of Nations....... is carried on&quot;.           As Lord Curzon knows they are-not of my,choosing.;  I&apos;    have always.felt that the League work which ought&apos; to bo by far    the moat important part of. our Joreign Policy can only be    properly done by a Minister in close and constant touch with    the  Foreign Office...   He should be in the position of  an    Assistant Secretary of* State with a room in the Foreign,Office    able to see its papers - and avail hi&amp;aelf of the services of its    staff.   Lord Curzon felt unable to accept an arrangement of    that kind when it waa pressed upon him.    He insisted that I    ahould be outside the Office though as a concession it was ^-    agreed that the telegrams ana printed despatches should be sent    to me, that I might see either of the two clerks who constitute    the League of Nations section of the Foreign Office, and    that no decision directly affecting the /                             -1-            -(
League should be taken without consulting me.   The last partof that agreement has been in fact largely inoperative.  Hodoubt this has been due to the difficulty of consulting a minister outside the Office.;.  But that in itself shows howunworkable the present system is.  It has produoed a want of. c o,r ope ration between the two Ministers which has beenvery harassing and in some cases very bad for the publicservice..  My colleagues will recollect how in the recentCorfu incident weeks of negotiations af Geneva were renderedalmost;, futile by an unfortunate decision of the Conference of ambassadors at Paris. . I was not consulted&apos; about that  decision -indeed I only hoard about it too late for my protest against&apos;it t* be effective;  and that is only one of several similarcases.  But it  is unnecessary to go back into past historyfor the Memorandum under reply itself shows how unsatisfactoryis the existing procedure,         Lord Cur?,on says that &quot;several of the departments have expressed&quot; to .the foreign Office criticisms of thedecisions arrived at by the Assembly last September and thatthe Poreign Office thereupon issued instructions requiring meto use my position on the. Council to nullify these decisions.May  I  remind my colleagues th&amp;t the decisions in question were in no sense a new departure?  They were merely carrying astep further a  pdlicy which had been pursued by the british representatives, colleagues of Lord Curaon, at previousAssemblies,  vVhen therefore, lord Curs on alleges that  thedecisions in question were taken by the Assembly at my instance&quot;without previous consultation with either the foreign office or the Cabinet&quot; he must have.momentarily forgotten that in
acting as I did I had every reason to believe that I was carrying out the settled policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is quite true I had always taken an active part in forwarding this policy and I did so at Geneva last year. Of my conduct on that occasion I received no complaint till I saw the Memorandum under reply save as to the admission of Abyssinia which is not now in question. I do not even yet know accurately which Departments have since objected. Nor was I given any opportunity to discuss with them their objections.

Apart from other disadvantages this proceeding was in my judgment deleterious to the public interest. The decisions at which the Foreign Office arrived in this manner demanded that the Council should take an attitude diametrically opposed to that adopted by the Assembly, a course which is almost if not quite without precedent in the history of the League; they required me to unsay what I have constantly urged on the Assembly and this year repeated without objection from the Foreign Office; and they were designed to further a policy which I believe to be both wrong and in the highest degree disapproved by public opinion. Naturally I "demurred". But I agreed in a conversation with Lord Curzon, largely taken up with other topics, that in view of the exceptional difficulties of the political position and the consequent impossibility at that time of consulting /the




 the  Cabinet I would  avoid committing the GpvernmoiTt  ana would; as  far ,as possible postpone  crucial  decisions until&apos;the next meeting o.t  the Council,   The  only point on-which it  can  possibly be.&apos;said  that  I went in the  least beyond  this &quot;understanding&quot; was that I agreed  silently -  for  the, matter was not  discussed  - to the re-appointment for one.  year of tho Temporary  Mixed Commission. That was ft matter which had been  keenly debated at Geneva, and I had taken a very decided&apos; line in pressing for its  re-appointment. for me to have taken  tho lead  in  asking  for a po tponamcnt of the question would have been very embarrassing and would..probably have failed,   or did it.&quot;;  re-appointment seriously commit-the Government; for, the Temporary Mixed Commission ijj an advisory body and its members in&quot;no sense represent the Governments of the countries from which they come,.  They attend in a purely personal capacity as is indeed pointed out in Lord question&quot; 3 memorandum..  All that the Temporary Mixed Commission can do is to make suggestions to. the Council and Assembly for.their consideration.     As to the Traffic in Arms I am surprised to hear that the foreign Office considers that the  Convention of St., Germain has been made &quot;practically operative&quot; by informal/
agreements between the Chiaf Powers eonoernpd.   CertainlyI have hoard British representatives in previous years&apos; -with I understood the &apos; full assent ,of the,,Foreign Of floe -use the most emphatic language in regretting the non-ratifica-tion of the  Convention.  It was described, in. the resolutions of the First Assembly based on a .Report by Sir Cecil Hurstadopted by the British Delegation as an. &quot;instrument of civilisstion&quot;.Hor can I understand how- it.can.be said that the partial preven-tion - it is certainly not more * of arms reaching, &quot;the. turbulentraces of Africa and the Middle East&quot;, is all that.could be doneby a really affeotive Convention on the lines of that of 3t.GermairuSuch a suggestion is not reconcilable with the resolutions,already quoted, of the first Assembly which I have, set out in an Annex to this Memorandum, together with a paragraph from SirCecil Hurst1&apos;s Report. ,      JOT tho foreign, office to  take up such an attitude on&apos;this question seems inconsistent with*the policy adopted In theprevious three years.  But as a matter of fact I did not in anyway&apos;commit the3ovornmei.it.  The U.S.A. in declining to ratify the Convention had said they were &quot;in cordial sympathy withefforts to rest riot traffic in aims and munitions of war,&quot;      - It was proposed at Paris by the representative of Italy,following the resolution of the&apos;Assembly, to ask thorn tosend delegates to the temporary Mixed Commission for thopurpose of &quot;co-operating with the Temporary Mixed Commissionin the preparation of a draft convention&quot;,      That seemed to: be quits harmless, especially as itwas explained  in the Minutes that no more than preliminary work was  to be done until  tho reply of the United States of america had.been received.  The Temporary Mixed Commission Is, as Ihave  said, an  advisory  body.  In the unlikely event of the UnitedStates of America sending representatives:&quot;/                             -6-  -   ,                    vf&apos;
 there and the discussions resulting in definite  proposals  the Government would he In no way bound by them.   The proposal of the French Representative referred to by Lord Curzon  was, as was explained, &quot;net a question of-substance but of  form&quot;.      As to the private manufacture of-arms what  I did  was  if possible more non-committal...... The -Council -with  my assent&quot;authorised one advisory body, the. Temporary,;&apos;;M,ixed Commission, to consult with another Advisory -Body,..the- ^Economic Committee, as to&apos;a possible Convention on..the. sub&apos;subject-,vt  In view  of the resolution&apos; of the Assembly and. the. positive, provisions of Article.8 of the Covenant ;I.-.-.do. not.- see-how,, the-oouncil could well have done less.   As to the merits,of the-question  I will only say that. the ,existing,,.scheme.v&apos;waevthe,.:,work, done some two years ago,  of Sir- Hubert..Llewellyn- Smith, who had, I understand, consulted trade experts. on;,the-.,subject.    His authority on&apos;trade matters will not,,, I imagine,.;.-be questioned., The political aspects of the. question seem, to -be settled by the terms of the Covenant?      As to the so-called regional-agreements&apos;&apos;&apos;!.,do not attach,.any great importance to:. them.:. -.&apos;, They-;&apos;a re.  net., as  the Memorandum assumes,  partial agreements .;of guarantee and  dis-&apos;armament.   They were a  proposal not supported by. me, made to the Third Committee of the Assembly, by one of the Scandinavian delegates,  for regional understandings for the reduction of- armaments without, anything else. .  The proposal never seemed to&apos;me very practical and I do not-anticipate that anything&apos; will come of the reference to the Temporary&apos;Mixed Commission.   In any case such ,a reference could^hot :&apos;even remotely affect the freedom, of action of Hia&apos;&apos;--Maj&apos;esty&apos;s Government both for the reasons already, given,   and because no one had: ever  suggested that we should  enter into such /               &quot;.&apos;              :y ;,,:/:&apos;,.; .
an agreement.        I have only to add that where it appeared thata decision by the Council might hamper the freedom ofaction of the Government as in the proposal that theCouncil should recommend all Governments to agree notto expand their armaments except in certain conditions,I did secure a postponement till, the next meeting of theCouncil.&apos;   in the result 1 venture to suggest that on no single pc&amp;asi of armaments policy io the Government lessfree than it was before the recent meeting of theCouncil.   If that ic true it shews that in no materialrespect did I fail to carry.out the agreement at whichI had arrived With&apos;the Foreign Secretary;,  and if therehas been any misunderstanding It arises solely from thesystem by which the League business of the country is atpresent:transacted.           * &apos;            .  -          (Signed)  CECIL,

The Committee would therefore urge that the Assembly should declare its high sense of  the gain  to civilisation which  woula ensue from a strict  control  of this traffic and should  invite the Council to  urge upon all Governments without delay speedy ratification of, or adhesion to, the Convention.4EXTRACT PROM REPORT OF FIRST ASSEMBLY ON   ,&apos;-.-  THE ARMS TRAFFIC CONVENTION.   &quot;No one can fail to recognise the  importance  ofsecuring the universal acceptance  and execution  of  thepolicy of bringing the arms traffic under  the  strict  *t&quot;control which was provided for by  the Convention of st.Germain.   Unfortunately it is  equally  true thatpowerful interests in each country will  oppose with success the introduction of such control until it can bemade universal.   No State is likely  to  sacrifice theinterests of ita traders when the  sole result of doing so would be to divert the trade to their rivals.   Itmust therefore be the object of the League of Nations,which is charged with special duties  in  oonnetion withthe Traffic in Arms, to secure the early and universal  ;ratification of the Convention&quot;
