document ia the  property  of Hia  Britannic  Majesty &apos;s  Goremnent.       S0HO0L TEAQHER3&apos; SUPER&amp;NNIttTION BILL, 1924.        Memorandum by the President of Education.                       O.P. 92 (24).     This Bill is designed to secure a temporary continuance ofthe contribution of five per cent, of their salaries which theSchool Teachers (Superannuation)  Act, 1922, imposed cn Teacherswhs benefit by the Principal Act  of 1918, which established anon-contributory superannuation system analogous to the CivilService system.  The Act of 1922  ceases to operate after 31stMay, 1924.     The Departmental Committee,..over which Lord Emmottpresided, reported on 30th July,  1923, in favour of theestablishment of a permanent system of Teachers&apos;  superannua-ticn on the basis of a     6 per cent, contribution by  Teachers     2  &quot;   v          *      &quot;  Local Education Authorities     2i &quot;   H          &quot;      &quot;the Exchequer,the contributions to be funded.     The Associations of Teachers  desire that permanent legislation.for England and Wales  should be postponed  .    (a) in order to allow time for mature discussion cn the        provisions of the Measure;  .  (b) in order that the settlement of Teachers&apos;  saiaries        for the period following  31st Maroh 1925 may not be        prejudiced or complicated by any decision to require        a 2i per cent, contribution from Local  Education        Authorities.  This feature in the Departmental
         Ccnraittee&apos;s  Report  ia highly  controversial,  and it  is         felt  that  if it were forced on  Local  Education         Authorities  they would  endeavour  to recoup themselves        &amp;y reducing  scales  of salary.     The National  Union of  Teachers have  expressed a preference that the permanent Measure  should  commence to operate as from 1st April 1926.  (The draft Bill provides that its own  opera- tion may be terminated by Order in Council at a date earlier than the ultimate  date, viz. 31st  July  1926).     It would be difficult to make sure of passing a permanentMeasure before the autumn of 1925, and  there  is indeed room fora good deal of discussion of its provisions.  A temporarycontinuance of the Act of 1922 has the  financial advantage thatthe whole of the Teachers&apos; contributions relieve the Tote of theBoard of Educati&amp;n as an &quot;appropriation in aid&quot;, and if thisrelief were cut off  it would he necessary to  increase the beard&apos;s Vote by  1,900,000 in 1924-25, and about  2,000,000 in1925-26.  (The exact amount would  depend on the revision of salaries due for that year).   This consideration, coupled withthe desire of the Teachers in England and Wales that permanent legislation should be deferred,  and their willingness tocontinue the five per cent,  contribution,  determined the latePresident of the Board of Education to proceed on the lines  ofthe draft Bill and to pass it if possible before 1st  June 1924.If passed after that date it must  operate retrospectively,  ifthe grave inconvenience of a ncn-contributory  interval  is to be avoided.    (The late Secretary of State for Scotland  was  in  favour  of immediate legislation en the lines cf  the Eeport of  Lord Emmett&apos;sOcmmittee).                                           C.
