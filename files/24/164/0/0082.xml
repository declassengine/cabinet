AGRICULTURE.           Proposals  suggested for^nnounoement In Parliament.i.            A definite  statement that  neither protective&apos; duties    on food.nor subsidies on the lines hitherto suggested can be    adopted.   Agriculture must be conducted on an economic basis    without  artificial supports from the public purse,2.      Wages.   Machinery must be set up to provide for the    payment  of reasonable rates of wages to agricultural labourers,    Wages  must be a first charge on the  industry and the Government    cannot acquiesce in the continuation  of a system under which    the current rate  of wages is fixed on the basis of  what the    least  efficient members of the industry can afford  to pay.3*      Co-operation.   The  Government  desires to extend and    develop co-operative  organisations for the purchase and sale of    agricultural requirements and. produce on the lines  -recommended    by the Linlithgow Committee.  In particular., Parliament will    be asked to provide funds for the purpose of making loans to    assist in the establishment of bacon factories, creameries, egg    collecting depot3, fruit grading stations, cheese factories,    slaughter-houses,  auction mart3, etc.   It is proposed to    appoint an Advisory Committee to the Ministry to consider and    report on applications for loans.4*      Credit.   The Government is examining the question whether    further facilities should be provided for granting  credit to    farmers for working capital either under the Agricultural Credits    Act or otherwise,5.      County Agricultural Committees^    The Government proposes    to make -pore use  of these Committees, possibly on a reconstituted    basis, for the promotion and development of agriculture in their    districts.   The  Committees will be  invited to use  their Influence    to raise the standard of farming, to call public attention both    to cases of new and successful enterprises by progressive
farmers and to any cases In which land Is being mismanaged ormisused; to advise as to the conduct of a campaign of publicity and propaganda to advertise British agricultural produce; to interest tbe general public in agricultural problems; to promote the fuller use of the educational and advisory service, and toassist in organising co-operative enterprises and better marketingfacilities as well as developing schemes for the Improvement oftransport facilities, the provision of electrical power and light,and the revival of village life.    Allotments.  The Government is anxious to assist and develop the allotment movement both in the urban areas and inthose country villages in which insufficient provision is madeat present for the, needs of the population.   The responsibleLocal Authorities will be urged and stimulated to make the fullest possible use of their powers in that direction.    Small Holdings.  The schemes for the settlement of ex-Service men on the land will be pressed forward and completed..With regard to rents, the Government recognises,  that in manyesses rents were fixed three or four years ego when agriculturalconditions wore more favourable than they are at  present and that ,consequently the original level of rents cannot be maintained.A thorough and systematic revision of rents is being carried outby consultation between the Ministry of Agriculture,  the CountyCouncils and the small-holders themselves, and in more than halfof the counties In England and Wales this revision has beencompleted and a settlement satisfactory to all parties has been arrived at.   The Government will make it their business to seethat the revision of rents in the remaining counties shall becontinued and completed with the minimum of delay.          The Government will also consider whether the scheme    *under which small-holdings for non-service men, which was  inoperation before the War, should not be revived in order toprovide for the needs of many men all over the country who havethe necessary knowledge and experience to become  successful
     small-holders, but who haye been debarred  for  the  last  ten  years,     from any opportunity  of  obtaining  land.8.        Reseai^c^and Education,   The  Government will  lose  no     opportunity  of developing  and extending  the provision for educa-     ticn and scientific research in the belief that  the  success of     agriculture  depends more than anything else on the personal     qualities of those who occupy and  cultivate the  land of the     country.  The Government  believes that  while  reasonable provision     has  already  been made for  the investigation of most  of  the  purely     scientific problems affecting agriculture, there is  great need  for     more effort  to bring  home  to the ordinary  working  farmers the     lessons  that science  can teach, and to do  more in  the direction     of practical research and  experiments  in connection with the     economic problems  of  the industry.  Further,  it is  suggested     that,  in accordance with the recommendation of the Lmlithgow     Committee, it would be advisable to attach marketing officers  to     the  Agricultural Colleges, who  could assist and advise  farmers  as     to marketing problems.   Funds  could also  be usefully spent in     making grants to assist  in the  formation and maintenance of     Farmers  Account Keeping  Societies, whereby bodies  of farmers     would  be encouraged  to combine  to  employ an accountant  to keep     their  books  on up-to-date  lines.               The Government is examining  all  these  possibilities  of     economic research  and education and will consider  whether further     funds  should not he  provided for the purpose.               It may be.  added  that  the Secretary for Scotland has     already appointed  a  Committee to advise  on the organisation and     finance  of agricultural  education  and  research in Scotland.9-       Drainagev   It has been estimated  that not less  than     1,000,000 acres  of land  is seriously waterlogged and is     consequently producing much less than  it could if  it was properly     drained.   The  Government  proposes to  increase the provision of     funds  for drainage schemes and  to  extend the time  during which  such     schemes can  be  carried  out.
