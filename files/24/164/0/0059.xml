AIR MINISTRY,                                               26th January, 1924.Dear Bankey,        With  reference to Item. 6 of the Conclusions of theCabinet Meeting held on the 23rd instant, there is at least oneessential piece of legislation which it will be necessary forthe Air Ministry to introduce in the very early future,        This  is the Auxiliary Air Porce and Air Porce ReserveBill, about which my predecessor in office wrote to you on the13th December, 1923, pointing out that without it we cannotstart recruiting personnel for the Auxiliary Air Porce and special Reserve Squadrons which are due to form this summer.        The only other possible requirement that I can foreseein the way of legislation is in connection&apos; with the BurneyAirship Scheme,  I have not yet had time to examine this schemeand  it will, of course, be necessary for it to be consideredlater on by the Government as a whole.  In the event of itsgoing through in its present form, as ny predecessor informed the  late Cabinet,, a short Bill would be required to confirm the  several agreements^                         Yours sincerely,         .                   fSd.) CoBe THOMSO.No,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.   February  5th,  1924.
