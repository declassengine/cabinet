Full * provincial autonomy can only  mean the complete divestment                                                   by

We are, however9exa&amp;in1ngthe possibility- of further reforms - under the Act itself, but we cannot forecast the conclusions to which  our examination may lead us, neither must it bs assisted that we  shall find it possible to re contend &quot;further advance within the  Act at present juncture^  Our own examination  of the  question cannot be - concluded within- a short period,, end  meanwhile the new Assembly &amp;nd the new Councils- win  he in the throes of the Swarajist attempts to wreck the existing  constitution., .

of a Commission, we should be prepared to frame our recommendations accordingly.

10. As regards the second resolution there is not the same fundamental objection to the adoption of the first ? items. As regards the third item, however, we not that on interpretation of sub-section (3) of ?A given by the Law Officers of the Crown, no extension of the powers of the Assembly is possible under the Act, and same applies to corresponding provision relating to local Councils. We could not, therefore, agree to this portion of the resolution at all. As regards the first and second parts also, a Committee of the Indian Legislature is an unsuitable body to advise, neither can we commit Local Governments as regards the second part.

11. We should be glad to receive a very early reply to this telegram.
