   [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                     Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1924.SECRET.                                                          &quot;C.P. 39 (24).                                                               2 3 0   Proposed legislation to enable certain High Officials in India to take leave to Europe                           during their term of Office.    A proposal has for some  time been under discussion1 at the India  Office  for amending a provision in the Government of India Act which lays down that &quot; if  theGovernor-General, or a  Governor, or the Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty&apos;s Forcesin India  .   .  .   departs from India, intending to return to Europe, his office shall thereupon become vacant&quot; (Government of India Act, section 8.7).  The term of office(prescribed by constitutional convention,  not by statute) of the Governor-General,  theOommander-in-Ohief  and the nine Governors is  five years.  The grant of leave to europe to any of these officials during their term is thus prohibited by law.    This particular provision dates from 1793, and has survived  all the amendmentsthat have been made in the  constitution of India since  that date ;  but  it has not been left unchallenged.  Amending  Bills were introduced  in  1888, 1891 and 1892; andalthough none of them  passed into law their demise was not due to a definite adversevote in any instance.  Proposals for amendment were also made by the Governmentof India in 1902 and in 1921.  On both occasions  the Secretary of State&apos;s  reply said in effect little more than that a suitable opportunity of legislating was not at the time iin prospect.   Mr. Montagu, however, left. it on  record in. March 1922 that  he had intended to proceed with the question of amending the Act; and my predecessor took the matter up last year with the Cabinet and the Government of India, and arrived at conclusions with which, except on one or two points of detail, the Government of india are in agreement.                       . .    The reasons in favour of a change in the law may be  summarised as follows :     (1) The present veto is a survival from obsolete couditions, and is not paralleled         in any other part of the Empire overseas.    (2) The opportunity of  personal consultation  between His Majesty&apos;s Government         and the Viceruy  aud his highest officers would be valuable.    (3) The  hardships on  the officers themselves of being  debarred  from coming         home either in.grave  illness or on  the most urgent private  affairs without         forfeiting office.    (4) The possible limitation upon the choice of men appointed from  home due to         the provision  that they must remain away for five years.    (5) The  fact that the changes, of  style  introduced  in  1919 prevent Heads of         Provinces,  often  senior Indian  civilians,  from taking  leave  like  their         predecessors who were called &quot; Lieutenant-Governors.&quot;    The main conclusions which have recently  been reached and  with  which theGovernment of India have expressed their agreement are     (a) that the Act should be amended&apos;to empower the Secretary of State in Council         to  grant leave  to the  officials in  question, subject to  conditions  to be         prescribed by statutory rules made under the Act;    (h) that the rules  should provide that leave  should  not  be granted  more than         once during a term of office, or ordinarily for more than six  months on each         occasion; but that subject to this provision the Secretary of State in Council         should decide the  reasons for which leave -should be granted;     (c) that  during the absence on leave of  the  Governor-General, the Commander-         in-Chief,  or  a Governor,  his place  should  be  filled  by  a  temporary         appointment to  be made by the Crown  (by  whom the  permanent appoint-         ments in each  case are made); and that the temporary incumbent should         be given by statule the full powers of the office during his tenure.     I recommend that  these proposals should be proceeded with; and if my colleagues agree I will prepare and circulate a Bill to give them  effect.   I think that such a Bill could clearly be regarded as non-contentious.                                                              SYDNEY  OLIVIER..     29th January 1924.7023    100  1.24
