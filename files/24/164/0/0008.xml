THIS document IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                         0 A B I IT 3 T.         FURTHER MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND            OH THE POSITION AS REGARDS THE SuP:i&amp;AJrNUATION            OF SCHOOL TEACHERS.(24)                       ---            1,    I refer to my Cabinet Memorandum of 13th November,       1923,  (C,P,463(23)), in which I drew attention to the very       serious  situation that was maturing in connection with the       Superannuation of School Teachers,,  and to the grave dangers       that would be involved in procrastination.    The  gist of the       Memorandum was that by far the most desirable course would       be to give immediate legislative  effeot to  the recommenda-       tions of the Emmott Committee,    In the altered circumstances       it has now become necessary to consider the position afresh.            2,    As the Act of 1922 expires in June,  the difficulty       must be  faced by any Government that is in  power  during the       next new months.   Whatever the scope of the new  Bill may be,       it is practically certain that there will be opposition.       On the other hand, the question is not in airy sense a party       one, and it would be very undesirable that  it should become       so.    The Emmott Report, which was unanimous,  was signed,  not       only by  representatives of the Treasury,  the Board of Educa-       tion and the Scottish Education Department,  but also by men       or women who were adherents both  of the Liberal and of the       Labour party.    Under these conditions,  the most  helpful  and       appropriate action for the present  Government to  take might       well be  to rest  content with a general pronouncement endorsing       the  policy formulated for them by the Committee.            3.    Should the objections to  this be  felt to be       insuperable,  the next best line to  follow would be^o do  and                                                             to/76&apos;. h
        to say nothing,  thus leaving the whole matter to the        unprejudiced consideration of the new Government and the        new Parliament.   Even to  hint at a temporary measure would,        to some extent,  hamper our successors,  and so play into the        hands  Of those who  are opposed to the introduction of a        soundly based Superannuation syatem,  and who wish the whole        burden to be thrown upon  the Exchequer.    It would be urged        that an understanding had been come  to  with the  outgoing        Government,  and  that  it would be a breach of faith to.upset        it,&apos;   Moreover,  the principal argument  for an immediate        decision to  introduce a temporary measure has now gone by        the board.    It  was feared that  the  postponement of such a        decision would prejudice  the settlement  of new scales of        salaries by  the  Burnham Committees,  which were to begin    &apos;    work in December,    As a  direct  outcome  of recent events,        the teachers&apos; representatives on these  Committees are to        decline further  discussion until autumn.            4,   If, notwithstanding what has been said,  the.        Cabinet should after all  decide  in favour of the immediate        announcement of  a further temporary  measure,  the outside        limit  should be  31st March,  1925,    This would leave the        ample  margin of  a full year for  the  inception and carrying        through of permanent legislation,  and would also have the        advantage of bringing the new system at  once into, line        with normal  Budget  arrangements,                         *                                              K0VAR                                                    5, .1.  24.Scottish Office,    Whitehall.
