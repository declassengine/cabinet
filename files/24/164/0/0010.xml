(l)   Prior to the Election I had provisionally arranged.00124) .  ,           with the National Federation of Building Trades Employers           and the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives           that they should meet me after the Eleotion, and oonsider           the question of apprenticeship in the Building trade, and           particularly in those &quot;Bottle-neck&quot; Departments, e,g.,           Bricklaying, Plastering, Tiling, where there is shortage.           I. have, since the Election, boon, pressing on arrangements           for this conference.                   . The Report of the Juvenile Unemployment Oommittee,           under the Chairmanship of the Financial Seoretary to the           Treasury (CP. 483(23) paragraph 30), expressed the view           that it waa desirable that suoh a conference should be           held early this year.               (2)   Reoently I have been in communication with both  -           organisations, and have tried to fix a definite date for           suoh a conference, but neither side is now disposed to           allow an early date to bo- fixed for the conference; and,           indeed, I have roason for thinking that tho Employers,           no  less than the Operatives, now prefer that the conference           should  stand over till after the Debate on the Address.                                   (Initialled) M.B.
