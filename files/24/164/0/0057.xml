DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESJY&apos;8  GOVERNMENT).Memorandum on the Law Officers of Scotland.      (Circulated by direction  of the  Brime Minister) o     The lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotlandstand to tho affairs of that kingdom in practically the  same position as the Attorney General and the Solicitor General ofEngland stand to those of that country,,  But tho former  havo,in addition, responsibility for tho conduct of the criminaladministration in Scotland under the system of futureprosecution there prevailing.     It is part of the unwritten constitutional law of theland that the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General forScotland are appointed from among the members of the ScottishBar.  This springs - in the same way as other parts of that lawfrom long custom.     The office of Lord Advocate - like the  profession ofadvocate -- is much older than the institution of the  Faculty  ofAdvocates (as the Ear cf Scotland is called).  The facultydates from the establishment of the Court  of Session  in 1532,In Scotland (as&quot; in Prance)  an advocate was a person holding an office of procurationy  the  distinctive function of which wasto plead other peoples  cases before the Sovereign Tribunals ofthe country, and the distinctive privilege cf which was the exclusive right of audience In the capacity  of pleader, beforethose Tribunals.  Tims, as  far back as 1424  (c.45) Statuteprovided that poor litigants should have the services of an56 (84,1 oC A B I N E !I.Lord AAdvocate.
&quot;advocate&quot; supplied to them by the Judge.   The lord Advocate,or King&quot;s Advoaate (as he was called),  appears as. pleader incivil suits on behalf of the Crown as early as 1478 (lordMedwyn in Earl of Denglass v. Lord Advocate 15 s at p.325);and as pleader in the King&apos;s interest in Parliament at  the trial of certain persons for resisting the Xing&apos;s forces in1479 (Act Earl. Scot. 11,125).  Our Gallic&apos;; Records do not make search to be carried further back.  .     The existing system of administering justice in,Scotlanddates from 1532 when James Y and his Parliament founded thoCollege of Justice by a long series of Enactments (cited underthe year 1537 cc.36-68).  The present Judges and Bar ofScotland are none other than the &quot;Lords of Council andSession&quot; and the &quot;Advocates&quot; or &quot;General Procurators of theCouncil&quot; mentioned in these Enactments.  These &quot;Advocates&quot; -along with the party litigants - were given, by expressprovision, the sole right of audience; and the forms of admission, oaths1, and duties of the &quot;advocates&quot;, forming the&quot;General Procurators of the Council&quot;, are preserved in use with but little change to this day.  &quot;The Eing&apos;s Advocate&quot;was given by another special provision the privilege of standing to plead within the Bar - a privilege he stillenjoys by virtue of the original Enactment.     Since 1532, the person appointed to the office of&apos;lord advocate has always been a Member of the Bar of Scotland.The only qualification on this general statement is one whichemphasises the professional character of the office - namely,that in  the early years after 1532, the holder of the  office was sometimes one of the Judges.  This practice did notsurvive the establishment of something like settled government.
     The Lord Advocate became one of the &apos;Offices .of state in 3.540.  He has been the regular public prosecutor incrimes generally since 1587,     She description of the Office given in the Institutesof the Law of Scotland by Professor W. Porbe3 is asaccurate-) now as it was 200 years ago when his Instituteswere published (1783) J-  &quot;The Zing names out of the Body  ,of Advocates, an eminent parson called Lord Advocate, whogives advice in making and executing laws, defends theEing5s right and interest, concurs in all suits beforeSovereign Courts for breaches of tho peace, and alsoin all matters civil wherein the Sovereign or any,claimingunder His Majesty has-interest&quot;.     In the early years after 1533, tho Office was sometimesconferred upon two persons at the same time.
               THE SOLICITOR GEHSRAL.     The Office of Solicitor General is  much less  ancientthan that of the Lord Advocate.   There is no reference  toit in our public records prior to the Union.     After the Union, there appear references to personsholding various appointments as  &quot;Procurators for tho Estates&quot;,&quot;Agents for the Estates1&apos;, and &quot;XingTs Solicitor&quot; or &quot;King^Agent and Solicitor&quot;,  The latter gf these apparently relatedN- in part -* to the King&apos;a Interests in the affairs of theChurch.  But it would require exhaustive search to elucidatethe exact nature of these various appointments. My impressionis that they were made oaeually, in tha first instance.  TheOffice of Solicitor General for Scotland arose out of - orfrom a union of - these appointments in one officer.  Thistook place, as far as I have teen able to ascertain, between1620 and 1650.  Prom its institution at that period the office has always teen held by a member of the Bar in Scotland,Involving as it always has done since its institution theduty of assisting the Lord Advocate in pleading Crown suitsbefore the Sovereign Courts, the Office could not  have teenheld otherwise. -     Traces of the origin of the Office as outlined in thepreceding paragraph are to be seen in the form of  the RoyalCommission of appointment which has remained unchanged in  form,from the institution of the Office until the present day,-     The Solicitor General, like the Lord Advocate, has the privilege of pleading as an &quot;Advocate&quot; within the  Bar.   Butthis privilege was not given to him by Act of Parliament  - asin the case of the Lord Advocate - but (in the first instance)
by the Court itself in 1662 (Act ef Sederunt  28 Feb.1662),and (after some variation of practice)  by direction of theCrown in 1725.     Ihe Solicitor General&apos;s functions  are to act as CrownCounsel along with the Lord Advocate.  He holds a deputation from the Lord Advocate enabling him to  plead, in his stead,in criminal oases.  He also acts as Counsel to the LordHigh Commissioner at the General Assemblies of the church of Scotland.      Until about 100 years ago, the Office was sometimesconferred on a plurality of persons at  the same time.2j,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,       4th February, 1924,
