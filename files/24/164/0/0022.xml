Ip. P. 22.(24)                   CABINET.1AGES CP GOVERNMENT WORKMEN IN THE LONDON AREA.Memorandum by the. Secretary of State for Air.   1.    I desire to bring to my colleagues&apos; notice theposition of the Air Ministry in relation to the proposals made by the Secretary of State for War in the paper he hasrecently circulated to the Cabinet  (CP. 3  (24;) on thesubject of the wages of War Department workmen in theLondon area.   2.    The Air Ministry Establishment concerned is theRoyal Air Force Stores Depot, Kidbrooke - a store-keeping,not an engineering, establishment.   A certain number ofcraftsmen of various trades are employed there on the repair of stores.   These are. paid the recognised rates oftheir respective crafts.   In this the practice differs from that of the War Office at Woolwich, where craftsmenare paid their pre-war rates plus engineering bonus.   TheAir Ministry practice as regards craftsmen is in strictaccord with the Fair Wages Resolution and has not beenchallenged by the men.   .3.    Wage increase to Labourers.   The labourers are paid the generalised-Government Labourers&apos; rate, i.e, thepre-war average rate plus the engineering bonus.   this basis was not objected to by the men until the engineeringbonus was reduced to 17/-, but since that time there havebeen constant  complaints that it gives a wage which (l)Is not a &quot;fair&quot; wage within the meaning of the Fair wages resolution and (2) is not a living wage.   The only con-cession so far made in response to these complaints hasbeen to raise the rate by l/- to compensate for the factthat the Kidbrooke working week is one of 48 hourswhereas the working week in the other industrial establish-ments of the service departments in London is one of47 hours only.   To the extent of this extra l/- a week the position of the Kidbrooke is better than that ofthe Woolwich men.   There is little doubt that if thesystem of having one generalised labourers&apos;  rate forall Government Establishments in London were  abandoned,and the labourers 1 rate for Kidbrooke was left to befixed on the basis of the rates paid to comparablelabour in private employ in accordance with the PairWages Resolution, a*rise of 3/- or 4/- a week wouldhave to be given.   It follows therefore that, so faras Kidbrooke is concerned, the adoption of the War Offioeproposal to Increase the generalised rate by 2/- aweek represents not a departure from the approved FairWages basis of the regulation of wages,  but a closerapproach to that basis.    For that reason I feel boundto support it, although from the purely Air Ministrypoint of view a preferable course would be either adefinite reversion to the pre-war method of fixing the   *generalised London rate or an agreement to excludeKidbrooke from the operation of the generalised rate.Either of the latter courses would involve a higherincrease than that proposed by the War Office.
          As the GcrTOr^ient-I^hoiir-ers1 representatives have declared themselves in favour of the maintenance ofthe generalised rate, the last alternative is not pressed;but in declaring themselves in favour of the maintenanceof the generalised rate, the men have made it plain thatthey are opposed to a generalised rate fixed on anengineering basis, and it seems clear that any generalisedrate which Is to cover a number of different types of establishments will be open to objection- if it is basedon the wages ruling in a particular industry, whenever the wages in that Industry fall below the general level -which is the position at the present time.          The objection raised by the First Lord in cp.16/24 to increasing the London labourers  rate Isbased on the fear that a corresponding increase would haveto be granted to the Labourers employed by them outside london, and that the increase would probably have to beextended in whole or in part to their mechanics also.There is no ground for any such fears as regards theAir Ministry, owing to our different system of wage regu-lation.   Our craftsmen, both in London and the provinces,are already getting the full wages which they can claim under the Pair Wages Resolution, and our Labourersoutside London are paid the full local rates;  indeed, oneof the unsatisfactory features of the present position -which the proposed increase in the London rate would goa little way towards remedying - is the fact that at anumber of places outside London the rates paid to ourlabourers are higher than the London rate.    4.    Transfer of .7/- of bonus to basic rate.   Theeffect of the proposed transfer of the 7/- from bonus to basic rates would again, in the case of the Air Ministrymean simply a closer adherence to the terms of the PairWages Resolution.   At present the only employees, otherthan bonafide engineering workmen, to whom we pay theengineering bonus, are the unskilled and semi-skilled workersin the Stores Depot at Kidbrooke, and the outside industrialscorresponding to the latter are in receipt of consolidatedrates of pay.   It follows therefore that the smaller theproportion of their total pay we show as bonus, and thegreater the proportion we show as basic rate, the nearerwe approximate to the outside practice, which is what thePair Wages Resolution requires us to do.     5.   Overtime payment.   As Kidbrooke is not anengineering establishment, the Overtime and Wight ShiftAgreement is not necessarily the most appropriate one toapply  to it, but I see no objection to the tfhr Officeproposal from the point of view of the Air Ministry provided the Air Ministry Is left with a free hand as to the consequential action, if any, to be taken at Kidbrookeand the other Royal Air Force Establishments.     6.   To summarise the foregoing      (a)     I desire to support the War Office proposal          for an increase in the generalised rate of 2/-          per week.   As regards the  objections raised by          the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP.9  (24),          I would point out that this proposal, in so far          as concerns the Air Ministry, does not meani.a
    departure from the principles laid down in the    Pair Lages Resolution, since it cannot be    said that the payment of engineering rates    at a storekeeping establishment, such as    Kidbrooke, is. in strict conformity with the    Resolution.(b)     I am also  in favour of  the war Office    proposal to transfer 7/- of the bonus to basic    rates.   In the case of the Air Ministry    this would, for the reasons stated in    para.4 above, mean a closer adherence to    the Pair wages Resolution.(c)     As regards the proposed concession in    correction with payment for overtime,  I    raise no objection to the  bar Office pro-    posal, provided the Air Ministry is left    with a free hand to deal with this question    at Royal Air  Force establishments on its    merits as and when it arises, having    regard to the radical differences between    Kidbrooke and Woolwich.(Int.)   S.H.Secretary of State for Air.IR MINISTRY,ANUARY 12th,  1924.
