FOREIGN AFFAIRS. -  Mr. Baldwin: Before we commence the business of to-day, theForeign Secretary has a brief statement to make.  STATEMENT BY  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN                         AFFAIRS.    Lord Curzon: It has been suggested to me that it might be well that I should say a word or two to the Conference about the position of foreign affairs and about our own proceedings in regard thereto. The Conference will  remember that we had a  discussion which I opened  with a statement,  ten days or more ago,  and which was&quot; followed by a discussion in which the Dominion representatives took part, and that then the discussion was adjourned in order to.enable the Foreign  Office to consider very carefully the suggestions and views, which had been placed before us, and  if possible to come  up at a later date with certain draft resolutions. Developments on Reparations  Question.    Just after that happened, a new situation  occurred.  It arose out of the report in the newspapers of the speech of President Coolidge in  America, in which he had rather gone out of his  way to reiterate Ameriea&apos;s willingness to help, in our economic troubles in Europe, and had taken his stand again upon the declaration first made  by the Secretary of  State in December  last.   I  gathered from the attitude of  the Conference here  upon the  matter  that there was nothing they would welcome more warmly than American co-opera- tion, and that an  opportunity of this sort evidently  started with some object by President Coolidge ought not  to be missed.. Communications with Washington.    Accordingly, I drew up a telegram, to Washington/ which I think has been circulated to you, in the endeavour to find out exactly what President Coolidge meant and how far he was disposed to go. The suggestion had been made that we might, so to speak, publicly seize the opportunity and cordially embrace President Coolidge&apos;s initiative. But we considered, I think rightly, that would be  unwise  because so sensitive are the.Americans about any outside intervention that had we made in public a declaration:  of that sort it was quite con- ceivable that President Coolidge might not only withdraw from the position he had taken up, but might even  have lost  his election, * The telegrams exchanged with Wsishinglon are reproduced as Appendix I.

Mr. Baldwin: Before we commence the business of to-day, theForeign Seoretary has a brief statement to make.  STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  FOREIGN                         AFFAIRS.   Lord Curzon: It has been suggested to me that it might be well that I should say a word or two to the Conference about the positionof foreign affairs and about our own proceedings in regard thereto.The Conference will remember that we had  a discussion which Iopened with a statement, ten days or more ago,  and which was followed by a discussion in which the Dominion representatives took part, and that then the discussion was adjourned in order to enablethe Foreign Office to consider very carefully  the suggestions andviews, which had been placed before us, and if possible to come up at a later date with certain draft resolutions.Developments on Reparations Question.   Just after that happened, a new situation occurred.  It arose outof the report in the newspapers of the speech of President Coolidgein America, in which he had rather gone ont of his way to reiterateAmerica&apos;s willingness to help in our  economic troubles in Europe,and had taken his stand again upon  the declaration first made bythe Secretary  of State in December last.    I gathered from theattitude of the Conference here upon the matter that there was nothing they would welcome more warmly than American co-opera-tion, and that an opportunity of this sort evidently  started withsome object by President Coolidge ought not to be missed..Communications with Washington.   Accordingly, I drew up ,a telegram, to Washington,* which I thinkhas been circulated to you, in the endeavour to find out exactly whatPresident Coolidge meant and how far he was disposed to go.  Thesuggestion had been made that we might, so to speak, publicly seize the opportunity and cordially embrace  President Coolidge&apos;s initiative.But we considered,  I think rightly, that would be unwise becauseso sensitive are the.Americans about  any outside intervention that had we made in public a declaration of that sort it was quite con-ceivable that President Coolidge might not only withdraw from theposition he had  taken up, but might even have lost  his election,* The telegrams exchanged with Washington ate reproduced aa Appendix I.
 because it would have been said at once :  &apos;&apos; Here is England inter- fering again and not allowing things to develop in their own way.&quot; Anyhow, we sent the telegram,  and, in consultation with the Prime Minister, we fortified the telegram by putting in the sentence, which I think  was justified in the  circumstances, that I was speaking in this situation not merely for His Majesty&apos;s Government, but for the much larger and more important body assembled round this  table. Then we  got  a reply from Washington, from Mr.  Chilton,  our Charge  d&apos;Affaires,  in three  parts, and  you will  gather from that quite clearly that the  American Government are prepared to  parti- participate, and that their participation may even take more than  one form. In my telegram I asked  them these questions. What exactly do you mean?  Does your statement mean that America is willing to join in a general Conference to discuss  the question of reparations in Europe, or does it  mean that you will be willing to send  somebody to take  part in a conference of experts under the auspices  of  the Separations Commission; and does it mean that you will only parti- participate in the event of all the Allies asking you; or, should the request not be unanimous,  are you still  disposed to give us your invaluable help? To that, as you will recollect, the reply was that they were prepared to take part in a  general economic conference  if invited to do so.   To the second question,  the reply was that they had in view that a competent American citizen would be prepared to  take part in an enquiry  instituted  under the  auspices of the  Eeparations Commission; to the third question, namely, whether they demanded unanimity as a condition of  taking part, their reply was  that they would answer that question when the situation arose. Communications sent to European Allies.   In these  circumstances, it appeared to  me that our  duty was to move at  once ; that we should acknowledge with thanks the encouraging- mg attitude  of America, which  I did in a  telegram last night, and that we  should acquaint our Allies with what had passed, and invite them to join us in proceeding.-   There were two alternatives that might have been adopted;  we might have merely invited our Allies to take part in the Conference suggested by Mr. Hughes in December last, the offer having been repeated now, and  have told them con- fidentially that America was  prepared  to join, or we might put  the whole of our cards on the table, be perfectly frank as to what we had.-done, because  after all it was right and justified,  and explain to them that, having seen what President Coolidge had said,  we thought  we ought to ask exactly what was in his mind,  and, having ascertained it, frankly to put the case before our Allies.  The Prime           * Minister and I decided in favour of the latter course,  It was perfectly . certain,  and you will see from  the American reply that they eon- template, it,  that publicity  would be given to their reply at a later date.  What I had more particularly in view was the fear that if we merely made the suggestion to our Allies in Europe that this idea of a  Conference had once again been taken  up,  treating  the idea of American co-operation  as  confidential, M.  Poincare would at once refuse.  He would-say,..&quot; This is the old plan which I regarded with disfavour six months ago;  you  are merely coming up with a staleproposal now,&quot; and he would seize the opportunity to refuse, knowing that the  question of American participation had been treated as con- fidential.  I thought there  was a very great danger in that attitude, and  that our one object now was not to put anybody in a hole  the least bit  in the world, but by common goodwill to get a move forward in which all, if possible, would participate; or, in the event of Prance or any other Power declining to  participate, that that Power should find  itself put in the wrong before the public opinion of the world.Accordingly, I sent last night,  after  consultation with the  Prime    * Minister, this telegram, which I will take the liberty to read.  It is a telegram addressed to the  French,  Italian and Belgian  Govern- ments : -       &quot;French (Italian) (Belgian) Government will be aware from   reports published in press that the question  of reparations, in   which the Dominions are equally interested with His Majesty&apos;s   Government,  has  been under  the  close  examination  of the   Imperial  Conference now sitting  in London.   The  members of
that Conference have been as much concerned as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at the.apparent deadlock which has been reached,all the more so that  they had  hoped that the  abandonment ofpassive  resistance would remove the  hitherto  unsurmountedobstacles to common action, and would be the signal for a freshand  united effort to  solve a problem that cannot any longer beshelved except at a  cost which  will weigh  with almost equalseverity upon all. While the Conference were considering  this aspect of the case, there appeared the declaration of the Presidentof the United States  that the American Government rested upon their proposal of December last.     &apos;  &apos;  ,   &apos;    &quot; It will be recollected that  this proposal was not at the timepursued, because Conferences  were taking  place between  theprincipal Allied Powers, each of which propounded a scheme of itsown for dealing with the problem as  it  then existed.   None ofthese schemes has been fortunate enough to meet with universalacceptance;  and in  the interval divergent policies have beenpursued, with the result that the  common action by which alonea settlement can be reached has again and again receded into the distance.    &quot;It did  not appear to His  Majesty&apos;s Government or to theImperial Conference to be either wise or courteous to ignore  thisrenewed indication of goodwill and of a desire to assist on thepart of  the  American Government.  Indeed, any such attitudemight have  exposed His Majesty&apos;s  Government to justifiablereproach.    &quot;On the other hand, they recognised the extreme undesira-bility of assuming on the part of the United States Governmentany intention in excess of what the Presidents words appeared to imply; and they felt that the first step was to enquire at Washing-ton  to what extent  His Majesty V Government  might,  if  theyapproached  their Allies in the  matter,  regard  themselves assustained by the hopes of American co-operation&apos;.   -    &quot;Accordingly, they addressed an enquiry  to the AmericanState Secretary, and were  gratified to learn in  reply  that hisGovernment continued  to feel  a deep interest in,the  economicsituation of Europe  and were ready  to aid in any practical  way in   promoting   recuperation  and   re-establishing   economic stability.  With  this object in view the United  States  Govern-ment, while emphatically repudiating any desire to see Germanyrelieved of her responsibility for the war  or of her just obliga-tions, were  entirely willing to take part, in an Economic  Con-ference in which all the European  Allied chiefly concerned inreparations  should participate,  for the  purpose  of consideringquestions of Germany&apos;s  capacity to make reparations and of drawing up an appropriate financial plan for securing payment.Such a  conference, if convened, should, in the American view, beadvisory in  character, and should have for its object the making of appropriate recommendations  by  a thoroughly informed  and impartial body, intent  upon solving the difficult  problems  sub-mitted to it on then- merits.&quot; Those, you will observe, are directquotations from the  American reply,  so that their case  is statedto the Allies in their own words.  &quot; Alternatively the AmericanGovernment informed us that, if after further consideration itwere thought preferable  that the suggested enquiry should be conducted by an advisory  body appointed by the  EeparationsCommission to make recommendations, they  would be willing that a  competent American citizen should participate. when this reply was received it did not seem possible to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment either to ignore an offer so generous and so helpful in its character, or to refrain from at once communicating  it totheir allies.  . They do so  in  the earnest hope  that the Allied; Governments will consider with the utmost care  the advantages to be derived from American co-operation at this critical juncture,and they entertain the  sanguine  belief that the French (Italian) (Belgian) Government will be willing to join them in&apos; inviting theUnited States  Government  without delay to take part in one orother of the forms of enquiry indicated by them.     &quot;The  direct participation of the  American Government appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be an object so  desirable
      in itself and so likely to be fruitful of result,  that they cannot      conceal the hope  that  the first alternative may be  the one      preferred.         &quot;In submitting this proposal.to the Government to which      you are accredited, you should represent the supreme importance,      in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, of not letting slip this      opportunity of resuming those common and friendly discussions      in which all parties have so frequently testified their belief.&quot;      Now the Conference may ask what I expect will come of this.      General Smuts :  That telegram has gone?      Loral Curzon: Yes.   It went last night; it was necessary to act   at once.   Probable Attitude of Prance and other Allies.      The Conference may ask what I think will come of this.  I think   it is extremely difficult for France  or  any other Power in these   circumstances to decline.   Belgium, we know, is  anxious  for this   enquiry.   Italy has  always been well  disposed towards it.   The   obstacle, so far, has been Prance.   M. Poincare may take one of   three attitudes.  He may say, &quot;No, I will not have anything to  do with this.   I am dealing  with Germany; I am not  satisfied with  her  attitude  until  I  am  convinced  that&apos;  she has  loyally  and  thoroughly accepted the situation.  The question of reparations can  stand over.&quot; He may say that, but if he says that I think he will  be alone.   Or he may  say, &apos;&apos; After all, this suggestion  of a  con-  ference in which America takes part, although it has been  suggested  by  the  President, is  an old  suggestion  made as  far back &apos; as  September last, rejected by me then, and merely revived  now with  the  object  of putting me in  a difficult position.  I deicline  to  look  at it.&quot;  Or he may  say and  I think  this is the most probable  reply that he will make, and if he makes it  it is all to the  good   &quot;I  have said  all the way through that this is. a matter for the  Reparations Commission, the body appointed under the Treaty to  deal with the question of reparations.   No one elseis really entitled  to touch it, and if America is disposed to send a competent business  man to join in an enquiry, conducted under  the Reparations. Corn-  mission, to  assist the Reparations Commission in determining the  present position, the present  capacity of  Germany to pay, so much  the better.&quot;   I think he may say, and  I think he will say, that.  If he does say that, I submit  to the Conference that it is a tremen-  dous move  forward, because we then  get the enquiry for which we have all along been working; and be  it remembered that if we get an enquiry in that form it is  precisely the proposal which we made in August last  and which, at that moment,  was turned down by the  French without  consideration,  although rather  favourably regarded by the Belgians.   Therefore,  it seems to me  that  the situation is on  the whole likely to be productive, and that  it has the further merit, if  I  may  say so,  of  placing at  this stage the initiative in our hands. Press Criticism  of British Government.    The  Government here has been very much  attacked-not; I think, fairly for having said, in our note of the 11th August, that&apos; if none of our proposals were  considered the alternative of  separate action might have to be considered.  The Press has been disposed to say, &quot;What  did this  mean?  Was it  a mere abortive menace? What does the separate action mean that you had in view? &quot;  Well, the reason why we did not take any separate action when  we received such  an unfavourable reply from the French to those overtures was this.    It was  threefold.    In the first place, we knew that this Conference  was going to meet at the end  of September or the beginning of October,  and we felt our position  would&apos;be greatly strengthened if, in any attitude we took up, we had  the support of the Empire  behind us.   In the second place, it  was clear at that time that passive resistance was shortly going to be abandoned; and it  was  quite  obvious  that the  moment  passive resistance was abandoned a new situation would arise and that any proposals for action, separate or otherwise,  made before might be stultified themoment  passive resistance had been dropped.  In  these  cireum- stances, and also because we were animated by the familiar desire
not to have a final break with France, we refrained from making .anyseparate proposals at the time.  But now, America has given us theopportunity and we are enabled to  say, not merely for debatingpurposes,   but,   I   think,   with  truth,   that  the   suggestionhaving been made we at once took it up.  With courtesy we asked the Americans what they meant and how far they would go.  Withfrankness we then  approached the whole of our allies,  we put  all our cards on the table, and invited them to participate.Advantages of Further Enquiry.    As regards the merits of the  suggestion,  that, being a financialissue, is one I will not confidently pronounce upon, but our Treasuryhere hold the view that, although the situation has been  very muchaltered, the desirability of an enquiry of this nature is  undeniableand great, and that it would  be  of serious profit if, in response tothis invitation, such an enquiry were now held.Future Resumption  of Discussions on Foreign Affairs.    The explanation I  have asked  permission to  make  to  theConference has not  merely been given in order to acquaint you with what  is going on which you are  entitled  to  know but  also toexplain why it is that the discussion on foreign affairs has not been resumed.  It will be quite clear,  I think, to  all  my colleagues thatwhile this move is going on, and until we get a reply from our allies,it would be useless  for us to  sit here and frame resolutions or lay down rules.   It is in the hope that the  situation I have explainedmay develop during  the course of the next few days that I make this statement, and have in my mind the idea of resuming the discussion on foreign affairs towards the end of next week when the situation has been rather further advanced.  .    General Smuts:  May I make a remark on that, Prime Minister?   Mr. Baldwin:  Yes,  certainly.    Lord Curzon:  Wouldyou like to read the  document?STATEMENT BY THE PRIME  MINISTER OF THE UNION OF                       SOUTH  AFRICA.   General Smuts:  I have quite  followed what you are saying.Conference of Allied Governments preferable.   I feel a great difficulty about the position which is going to arisenow.  I agree with you that M. poincare  is going  to  accept  thesecond alternative, that is an enquiry by the Separation Commis-sion, or under the aegis of the Reparation Commission.   What you have in mind, and what they have made the first alternative, wasa Conference of Allied Governments, which would have been some-thing really first-class and valuable.   The second alternative, whichthe Americans have  made, seems to me really fairly futile for thisreason; they say they are really going to take part in the enquiryunder the aagis of the Reparation Commission.  You will see fromtheir telegram that  they say that competent  American citizens canbe  found  who will do this.  They dissociate  themselves  fairlystrongly from the Reparation  Commission.  They are not going totake part, but, as they said  last December, competent Americancitizens can be found who would take part in this  enquiry.  It seemsto me you are not really pulling America in at all.  We do not wantan enquiry in  which some American takes part, but an  enquiry inwhich the American  Government takes part; and  the first  alternative would rope in the American Government.  You follow my point?   Lord Curzon:  Perfectly.   General Smuts:   The second  gives the  American Governmentthe chance of.eBcape, because they are not really responsible; theyare not really1 roped  in,  Some American citizen will be found, andM. Poincare, on the other hand, would be very glad too.  He could say:  &quot;.It has been my decision all along  to  let the ReparationCommission enquire  into this matter.&quot;  The result wall be that someenquiry will start now into German  capacity; what it will lead to,I do not know.  It  will be a long time, and the position is most
urgent and dangerous;  the developments in the ruhr are of a most dangerous character, and we  may soon be faced with  an appallingsituation while this enquiry under the aegis of the Reparation  Corn-mission would be going on.  I would press much more strongly forthe first alternative. I am afraid of the use which M. Poincare is going to make of the American reply.  I  think you are right thatthe second alternative  is  going to be accepted, but the first wouldhave been the real thing,  that is a conference of the Allied Govern-ments  where America  is  represented as  such, where she herselfappears on the  scene,  and where she does not merely  send  someunofficial independent financial person to join in the conference.  it looks to me as if the whole thing is going to prove abortive.   I do not blame you at all, but  I am  afraid that  what is nowhappening means that both America and Prance are going to escapeand that what we are really after will not be done, that is, to  get aConference where  we can  get at grips with the situation.   Lord  Curzon:  The  situation, of course, is not yet determined.General Smuts is proceeding on the assumption that my conjectureof M. Poincare&apos;s attitude turns out to be the  true one.  It may beso; but,  on the  other hand, supposing that Italy and Belgium areprepared for the first alternative rather than  the second, we  maystili be able to apply pressure.Need for pressure on United States  Government.   General Smuts: I hope we shall use whatever pressure we can.We want America in.  America does not really come  in under thesecond alternative.   That  is the weakness I saw in the  suggestion made last December when I read it in the papers.  It seemed to mejust &quot; eye-wash,&quot; to use a  vulgar expression.   America did not sayshe was prepared to take part in such an  enquiry, she merely said there would be  a competent American who could fake  part in this.   Lore!  Curzon:  I think it is really rather more, than that.  Ibelieve  that  what  the Americans  would do  would  be  to  inviteMr. Pierpont Morgan,  or  someone of that description, to. join in.It is quite conceivable  that if they joined  in the first  enquiry theymight  be similarly  represented, but,  as  regards the ReparationCommission, you will have noticed from their reply that they cannotappoint formally a member without  the consent of Congress, whichis not now in session.  That is the reason  they suggest their repre-sentative might be some competent  American  citizen.  I think theTreasury here would say that if the enquiry  takes  place the  mainthing is to get it started.  It would be quite as  good, from our  pointof view,  to  see  Mr. Pierpont Morgan  sitting  in a  quasi or semi-official capacity  on the Committee as it would be to get  any directAmerican  representative  sitting at  the  Conference.  I  admit thedesirability,  from  the  point  of view of  prestige,  of getting theAmerican Government in, and of course we will do our best to securethat end, but we must not assume that the game is up before we havehad the reply of our Allies.   General  Smuts:  I  wanted to impress upon  you  what I feel strongly, that we want to exercise pressure  on the American Govern-ment, and we must try and  do so, we must try and get the AmericanGovernment in  directly rather than some financial expert whoseopinion will not  weigh.STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND.   Mr. Massey: I would just like to say that I do  not look at theposition from the same point of view as General Smuts.Conference of Allied Governments preferable.   First of all, let me say, I hope&apos; and I think every one round the table hopes that the suggested Conference will be arranged.&apos;  Withregard to the point emphasised by General Smuts,  that  any  com-petent  American citizen to  use  the expression  which  has  been already used would not be representative- and I am not quite sure that I  am  correct in this-of the American  Government and theAmerican  people, I  take  it that any competent American citizenrequested to act, and therefore appointed by the American Govern-ment,  would undoubtedly&apos; be representative  of   the . American
Government, even more than in a semi-official capacity.  I agree itis  not quite so  good as  having a  direct representative of  theAmerican Government, one of themselves; but take this  instance,which is a case, I think,  fairly parallel.  It  was found,  when  theWashington Conference was being arranged, that no member of  theNew Zealand Government could go and  represent that  country.   Itwas  quite  impossible.   Under  the circumstances  we  appointed a judge of the Supreme Court, who acted for us as our representative,and who was accepted at the Washington Conference as the directrepresentative of New Zealand.   I say the cases may not be quiteparallel,  but they  are not very far away from each  other, and noobjection was raised to what was done in that case.   I hope,  as I have said, that  the  Conference will be  arranged,and that M. poincare will agree,  and  that is the point  about whichI am in doubt.  If he approves,  then there is a strong probability ofsome agreement being arrived at, that  is  what  we are all waiting for,and I hope such will be the case;  but the Foreign Secretary raiseda point which I think  is very important  and should  not be lostsight of,  and it is this.Danger of Premature Publicity.   Great care should be taken, if it is possible to do it, to make itimpossible for Party Politicians in America to discredit the AmericanPresident in connection with the proposal.   We all know the feeling of Party Politicians in America  and even in our own  countries, andwe know that no opportunity is ever lost; we know too that, though there may  not be a majority of opponents of the British Empire inAmerica, even so there  is a very strong party in  America who  are undoubtedly opposed to Britain.   The  feeling is friendly on the partof the people who take the lead in politics and public affairs as far asthe American Government is concerned.   What is in  my  mind is this and I formed it after a talk with the new President-1 thinkthat he should be consulted before his  name is used publicly, so thatif necessary  he might give advice with regard to what should bedone.  Otherwise,  so far as I am concerned, I do hope the Confer-ence will be. arranged because  there  is  a  possibility of settlement and that possibility should be followed up.                     ,STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE COMMON-                  WEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.Conference of Allied Governments Preferable.   Mr. Bruce: Prime Minister, the position  being as it is and  the cables  having been exchanged,  the most desirable thing is  to  pressvery hard  to get the Governments concerned to arrange  a Confer-ence;  but it certainly  strikes  me that we  may  get  into a verydifficult position.Difficulties likely to arise.   There is a danger  that  this  action may put  us  in  a  moreembarrassing position than  we  are  in at the present   moment,because the cable  which was sent, after the  President had made his statement, really refers to the original proposal.  That proposal was to conduct an  enquiry into Germany&apos;s capacity to pay.   Thewhole  trouble with France  during the  last month has been that france  objects to  the present  moment being taken as  the timefor  determining Germany&apos;s capacity  to pay,  and if France  says,as the Foreign Secretary suggested she might &apos;&apos; This  is an  oldproposal, this is a  stale proposal, we have heard it before&quot; the minute there is the slightest difference of opinion between the Alliesand. Europe, America will  immediately draw into her shell  andwe shall not advance one  inch.Use of Name of Conference in First Telegram to Washington.   The only point  I want to press is this, that in the cablegramsent to America the name of this Conference was used.   I agreethat the name of the Conference should  have  been used, but Ithink,  in view of what had been said here, the Conference oughtto have been consulted first.  One has got  to remember that when this  question was discussed here,  both General Smuts  and myselfsuggested that  there was  a difficulty  in view of France&apos;s  attitude
 (an attitude with which I  admit I have some sympathy) in saying they are not prepared to  accept an  enquiry  at this moment into Germany&apos;s capacity to pay when Germany herself has deliberately depreciated her capacity.  Hence a cable in the name of the whole Conference,  taking  up the original suggestion of an enquiry into the capacity of Germany to pay, seems to.me  to be not quite in accordance with  the views expressed  in the Conference up to that time.   The Conference had actually come to no definite view as to what action should be taken.   It could  not have come to a definite view without a  further discussion on  the whole question.   The danger I now feel about the whole position is that possibly we shall find that France refuses this,  and  I am inclined  to think that, although France might thereby incur a little odium in  the  world for a few days, it would not be much more than she has incurred already.  There  will be no pressure upon her to come  in because America will immediately withdraw.    On the other hand,  if we had come  to a conclusion  as  to  determining  an arbitrary amount that Germany should pay, and if we could have got agreement upon that between the Allies, we should still have America in reserve, and she might have been brought in  and might have been of very great value in getting agreement as to  that figure,  and also as to how the arbitrary amount  agreed upon should he  paid.  Having said that,  I  recognise that the position now is that  certain action has been taken,  with  which I  agree,  and.I hope we shall get  out of  it as  well  as the  Foreign Secretary  hopes,  and  that  some advantageous results may follow.    Lord Curzon: I will only utter one word in reply to one observa- tion of Mr. Bruce&apos;s.  I think  he is a little exaggerating  what we did in  the  telegram to Washington,  in which  the  sentiments  of the Conference were expressed.  After all, it was merely a telegram on our  part to express  our warm approval of the position that the American Government is once again  disposed to maintain in our troubles, and which will help us.  That is really not committing this Conference to anything very serious. ;   Mr.  Bruce . The  telegram quite definitely says at  the end : that this Conference and the whole of the British Empire representatives at the Imperial Conference desire to associate themselves  with the proposals;  but, if we read the earlier  part of the cable,  it is made perfectly clear that  the Presidents suggestion  is really  the late Presidents  suggestion  again,  and there is no getting away from the fact that the  late Presidents suggestion was that there should be an enquiry held into the capacity  to pay.  That  is the point I was making.   Mr.  Baldivin:  I  will now  call upon Lord Derby to make his statement.                    MILITARY  DEFENCE. STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR WAR.   Lord Derby:  Prime Minister,  I desire to make  a brief  state- ment as to the military position at the  present  moment.  I  quite agree that  it must be  very subservient  to the Naval policy of the Empire, still, at the same time, I think the members  of the Confer - ence would like to know exactly what our position is  at the present moment; but, as there was a Prime Ministers&apos;  Conference in 1921, there is no need to repeat details  of the  military position as it was prior to that date.   Comparisons between our military forces andthose of foreign Powers are misleading, but it must not be forgotten that,  though Germany has been destroyed in a military sense, Europe  is still an armed camp, for there are 1,300,000 more men actually under arms  to-day than there were in January, 1914.  In spite of  this, we have reduced our army, and as the full reductions in  the army have now been made, and the Government has statedthrough me that  no further reductions  are  contemplated, it  maybe  of advantage briefly to restate  our own position and compare it with what it was  in  1914. Comparison with  1915.  Present Size of Continental  Armies.   The  stage is set  to-day  very  differently  from what it was  in1914.  Then Europe was composed for  the most part  of strong and
 solvent uations,  of which Germany was  the  most ambitious and powerful,  while  Berlin  was the  centre of militarism and  of  the greatest military machine  the world has  ever  seen.  The other nations were  either grouped against Germany for their  protection or  leagued  with  Germany  for  their  advancement,  or  sitting impotently and anxiously on the  fence.    Now Germany  is  down and out,  and her naval  power which directly threatened our own is broken, and France has become  the paramount military Power. France,  to-day, has an army of 568,000 men  under arms,  apart from 216,000 coloured  troops also under arms.    Mr. Burton:  Are the coloured troops all in Europe?    Lord Derby:  No, they are not all in Europe.  That is her total strength.    Italy has an  army of 320,000.    Russia is still an unknown quantity, though  we know that she has some 735,000 men under  arms, while the Balkan States have also an aggregate of 750,000 men under arms.    Poland 250,000 men.    It  is clear  by the figures  which I have quoted  that  the size of our own army has no relation whatever to the size of European armies; but even in pre-war days the size  of our army  was never so  governed.   It is important to realise the functions which now, as in 1914, regulate the size of the British  Army.   These functions are throe-    fa.) Provision and  maintenance  of   the  essential  Imperial          Garrisons.    (6.) Provision of a small  Central Reserve to act in co-operation          with the Navy as Imperial interests may require.    (c.) Provision against civil riots at home. Present Strength of British Army.    In 1914 we mobilised 17  regiments of Cavalry and 6  Divisions at once,  and a 7th  Division within a few weeks; a  total force of 182,000 men.  We have now lost 2 Divisions  all but  2 battalions, that is to say,  22 Line battalions, and 9 regiments, of Cavalry. Now  that  the  situation  in the Near  East permits,  the  force we, could put in the  field amounts to  a  Cavalry division  (9. regiments) and 3 divisions; say, 98,000 men.  The Cavalry division, by reason of the reduced peace establishment  of horses,  would  be incapable of action  until additional horses had been hardened:and trained. Mobilisation  of the 4th and  5th divisions would  depend, upon recruiting of technical personnel and would in any event take, somemonths.    The chief reasons why, for  the present,  we  cannot mobilise the 4th and 5th divisions on the  outbreak of war are  the  exhaustion of the Army Reserve (now 76,000,  to be  brought up  this year by special recruiting to 84,000, against 146,00,0 in 1914),  the abolition of Special Reserve Battalions, the  reduction of the number of fieldbatteries below that required  for  5 divisions,  so that we-shouldhave to form fresh  cadres not only of  Signals,  Transport, &amp;c, but even of Field Artillery, and the fact that the tradesmen necessary to complete the  increasingly large  technical  parts of a  modern&apos; army do not exist either in the ranks, in  the regular reserve,  or in the shape of Militia.                                     1   We are proceeding with a school for training boys  as tradesmenfor  the Army,  and are  prepared to organise a technical Militia, andthe mobilisation  position will be gradually improved; but in any event it will take years of steady progress at our present Establish-ment  before  we  can bring five divisions   to  the  same  pitch  of readiness  for war ,,as the seven &quot;of 1914.   Even then, on mobilisation a battalion will be only 888 strong asagainst 1,000 in 1914, and a battery will consist  of 4 guns insteadof 6; and, for  expansion to full war strength  in a great war, we have only the Territorial Army to build  on.  The strength of thelatter to-day is 140,000 out of an  establishment of  180,000,&apos; as^mpared  with  1914, ,when there was a strength,  of 265,000 out  of   establishment  of 312,000.   I am glad  to  say that after rather a lapse  at the end of the war of the interest  in the Territorial  Forceit is gradually reviving, and  I see  no difficulty in bringing this
 Territorial Force up to the  full establishment, which of course is considerably below  what it  was in 1914.  But still I  think  that that will perhaps be even better done  than it was before that date. Moreover, as we  cannot find money for the Infantry and Field Artillery (Special Eeserve), we have no provision for making good the casualties which will occur in the regular Expeditionary Force while  the national  army is being got  ready.   It may be true  that owing to improved weapons the fighting power of each unit would be as great as in 1914 or greater, but the same increase of power may be found in any of  our possible adversaries.  We are doing every- thing  that we can  to advance. what  I would call the mechanical side of the Army, and  I believe myself that we are not only keeping abreast of foreign nations, but we are going ahead of them.  It is obvious, therefore,  that no charge may  be  made against us of keeping  a  large Army with militarist designs.   On the contrary we have barely sufficient for what we will call the policing of our Empire, because, not  only is our Army less, but our commitments are greater.  I should like to  review  our  Overseas Stations where our Forces were in 1914. Overseas Stations:  India.    In India in 1914 we had 75,000 troops, we have now 62,000; that is to say, six  Infantry Battalions and one Cavalry Regiment less than in 1914,  but  a further reduction  is being made there  still to meet  the great  strain of the fiscal  position  there.   Two  further Cavalry  Units  are  leaving there to come  on  the Home strength; Artillery Units  are being withdrawn and even  the  numbers in each battalion have been reduced.  I should like to emphasise here the fact  that we do not look upon, and never have looked upon, India as being  the  base  of an Expeditionary Force,  and the Force that we maintain there has been for the purpose of defending India against external attack and of providing internal security, and really comes under the third of the headings which I have enumerated. Egypt.    In  Egypt in 1914 we had 6,400 troops, to-day we have 12,600. We are obliged to keep a larger Force in Egypt, and, though this may be eventually somewhat reduced,  still  the fact is that with the granting of Independence  to  Egypt the  control of the Egyptian Army may pass out of  our hands, and  it is essential that we should keep such a Force as in the opinion of  the Imperial General Staff is necessary for the defence of the Suez Canal.  I need not go into the importance of the maintenance of the Suez Canal in our hands, Lord  Salisbury dealt with  it the  other day,  but  it is  the  key to our military position in the  interests  of all the other Dominions, and it  seems to me that we should not relax or allow to be relaxed such a hold on the  Canal which our Military Authorities think is essential. Iraq and Palestine.   In  addition  we have Iraq and Palestine, and, although in both those places  there  may gradually be a  reduction  as  affairs,  as we.hope they will  do, get more  settled,  still if  we take all  the troops  away it would only mean the addition to our ExpeditionaryForce of two battalions.Gibraltar, Malta, Hong Kong, &amp;c.   There are besides, Gibraltar, Malta, and Hong  Kong, and other similar stations to which are  allotted  14,000  men as  against the33,800 before the war.The Rhine.   Now with regard to our new commitments.   In time to cometroops will be withdrawn from the Rhine, but I would like to pointout that  even at this  moment those troops are counted as being on the Home  Establishment and are included in the figures for thesmall Expeditionary Force which. I have already given to you; andI must say that there have been great duties laid upon the MilitaryForces of the Crown in endeavouring in Silesia and other places tocarry  out the provisions of the Treaty  of  Versailles.   All the
Dominions were signatories to the  Treaty, but it has been left tothe mother country&apos;s Imperial Porces alone to provide all the troopsthat were necessary to carry out  the military conditions  of that treaty.  I only mention that as a fact just  to show that some ofthe duties have thrown a great strain on our Home Force.  I haveno complaint to make of this I only state what is a fact as regardswhat has taken place since the date  of the Armistice.Constantinople.    I am glad to say that that commitment has now been liquidated.Sir Charles Harington  has  brought, troops back - to England wherethey will take their allotted places in the Expeditionary Force thatis being built up, and  I must say  that the utmost credit attaches to Sir Charles Harington for  the marvellous way in  which he hasbeen  able to bring away this  large Force from what was a hostilecountry without a single disquieting and disagreeable incident, andnot only  so, but with expressions  of friendship from the Turksand others which may  be of some  value a fact  which shows thathe had a great effect on the population of Constantinople.Iraq and  Palestine.    These two areas which are entirely new commitments have nowbeen  handed  over by  us  to  the  Air Ministry,  and the militaryresponsibility  for the  safety  of their  frontiers devolves upon theSecretary of State for Air.  In Iraq  we have  only  two british battalions; in Palestine we  have no British Battalions.Singapore.    A question was asked I think about Singapore by  Mr. Bruce theother  day.  The position is this, that before the war we had oneEnglish battalion there, and  we had a battalion which was foundlocally by the Malay  Peninsula.   That battalion has disappearedand has been replaced by a battalion from India, for which the MalayPeninsula pays.   There are also a certain number of other troopsthere.  The position of  Singapore is held by my military advisers tobe one which it is very  difficult to attack, even if there is no british fleet whatever in being, and is the  only place where such a harbourcould  be  made.   They believe it to be almost invulnerable.  Theyare perfectly content during the building of the works there to leavethe defence as it is at the present moment.   Eventually, of course,it will be necessary to make further provision for the manning of the guns, but there  probably will not be a very large number of men required.  With regard to the Infantry, a  scheme is being drawnup, and not definitely settled yet, in case of any appearance of trouble,for immediately reinforcing the troops there with three battalions of Infantry; and my military  advisers authorise me to say that theyare content, from the point of view of safety, with Singapore, withthe arrangements now in being or in progress of being developed.Quota  would  be allowable  under  International Agreement greater       than present size of Army.    With these  enormous  mandated  territories, apart  from ourdefinite Imperial liabilities,  I expect no one can accuse us of keepingup a large Army for militaristic purposes.   I am perfectly certainthat, if, on the lines of the Washington Conference, an agreement was come to for a general  reduction by the Great Powers of theirarmies, we should find that there would be no reduction necessaryin the Imperial  Army, that the quota that would be allowed to  us would be greater than the Force that we have in existence.Principles governing present Strength.    Our Army is organised on the principle  laid down by the late government.    First,  that there would be  no  great war for tenyears three  years  of  that have already gone by and, secondly,possible small expeditions, and, believing as we do that, in the caseof another great war when popular opinion was behind the Govern-ment, there would be the same influx of recruits that  we had duringthe Great War, we are endeavouring to organise  our  small Army to expand and to have ready at  hand the equipment   necessary for immediate expansion.
 Co-operation with Dominions.    Now, if I may, I will turn to the relationship between the Home Army and the Military Forces of the Dominions.  In practice, as apart from theory,  it is  impossible to draw a hard  and fast  line between local and Imperial requirements.   The local security of any portion of the Empire depends, to a considerable extent,  on the aggregate of its disposable military strength, and inversely the safety of the Empire as  a whole is dependent on the  strength of its com- ponent parts.   This  applies with particular force to the present moment when the centre and all outlying portions of the Empire are reduced, militarily speaking, to the lowest limit.  We  can no more  confine the calculation  of our strategical  requirements in various parts of the Empire to watertight compartments than  we can definitely circumscribe  the iheasure of potential enemy  action to which any one  part may be exposed.   Just as,  in the Big War, the  Dominions   came  overseas  to  the  fullest   extent  of  then- capabilities to fight for the Empire, so, if any of our Dominions were attacked,  would the whole  Empire send  every available man  and devote all  its resources to the help of such Dominion; but that, if I may say so, emphasises the fact that, just as  we in Great Britain held  the fort till  Greater  Britain could come  to  its  aid, so each Dominion  should  be in a position  to stand the brunt of the first attack until all the other  Dominions could bring our men into,the fight.   I  should like to tell you a little personal matter that happened to myself.   What  I Want to say is that each Dominion should be in a position, if attacked, to draw a line round the part attacked and hold the enemy until troops can come from other parts to help you to drive them out.  In the worst time in 1914, after the retreat from Mons, I went to see Lord Kitchener,  who was a great personal friend of mine I was not in office then it was a time when it looked as if we were going to be separated from the French and gradually to be  driven into the sea, and I asked Lord Kitchener what he was going to do.  He had a big map in front of him, and he simply took his thumb nail and drew a line across the Isthmus that goes out, and he said,  &quot;I am going to  do what  Wellington did, I  am going to make my line as  he did at Torres Vedras, and hold on until  the Nation is  ready  to push the Germans back.&quot;  That is  an idea of what one has in one&apos;s mind as to the position each Dominion  should occupy.   If I may say so,  Mr. Bruce exactly hit the nail upon  the  head.The meeting of the first attack on any Dominion, and to resist it, is the duty of that Dominion itself.  It is not so much the question of man power; important as  that is there is no doubt, as I have said, that, in a war endorsed by the whole Empire, men would flock to the Colours as they did in the Great War.  At the present moment  many of those would be  old soldiers, and with very little training&apos;would be able to take the field. Need for Preparation.   Of course, that is an advantage  that will gradually die out, but we hope each Dominion  will see its way  in the rising generation to prepare a certain proportion of their younger men  to undertake thedefence of their country;  but what is important is,  first of all, that there  should be complete agreement in the military mind not only of this country, but of the  great Dominions, as to what steps should be taken in the event of  an attack  on any one  part of the BritishEmpire; secondly,  that we should know approximately, each of  us, what assistance would be forthcoming at all events at the immediateoutbreak of (he  war; but even  more important than that  is the necessity that each Dominion should possess  the requisite amount of ammunition and.  equipment necessary  fully to  equip  the force which ithas.   It is no use having men unless they have equipment, guns and ammunition. Need for Common Training and Equipment.   Lastly,  it is very necessary that our training and  organisation should be one within the  Empire;  that we should have the  sametraining for the whole of the  troops of our Empire.   I do not for one moment pretend  that, because we put forward our organisation and our equipment and our training as a model, it is by any means
perfect; it may be that after consultation we shall find that for thisparticular task of defending the Empire modifications are necessaryhere just as much as anywhere else, and I should not hesitate to propose them if any  such agreement were come to.   What I would urge, and I feel I can hope to carry the representatives of the greatDominions here with me, is that there should.be the  closest touch,by  correspondence if necessary, by personal meetings  wherever-possible, between the military heads of this country and  the  greatDominions.   The Defence problem is like a great puzzle  composedof many different pieces,  of which the Mother Country and theDominions each hold some pieces.   We want topiece these togetherso as to make it a complete picture.   I believe it can be done, and i venture to hope that in this task the Government and the MilitaryAuthorities at Home will have the cordial assistance of the Govern-ments and the Military Authorities of each of the great Dominions.                       AIR DEFENCE.  STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.   Sir Samuel Hoare: Prime Minister, the Committee of ImperialDefence have  already circulated an Air Staff paper to the ImperialConference, and  I have in  addition  circulated  to  the  EconomicConference a paper on Air Communications.  I hope to deal in  ageneral way this morning with several of the questions raised in theAir Staff paper, and I intend this afternoon at the Economic  Con-ference to develop certain of the points raised in my paper on air communications.   In particular I shall be dealing at the EconomicConference with  the  question of airships  which,  although it will eventually  raise questions of military  and  strategic importance, isin its initial stages principally a  commercial and economic problem.I do not, therefore, propose to deal with the question of airships thismorning  unless the Prime Ministers desire it.   I will only say thatthe Committee of Imperial Defence attaches definite military import-anee to their development from the point of view of long distancenaval reconnaissance,  troop carrying, particularly in small wars, andin the future as aeroplane carriers, and it is on this account that theGovernment proposes to resume their development by means of subsidies to a  commercial company which has  undertaken to  starta commercial line first to Egypt and subsequently to India.Air Defence.   This morning  I propose to restrict  my observations to the onlyair weapon of  which we are actually making use, namely, the aero-plane.  Moreover, I desire to concentrate the attention of the PrimeMinisters upon what appear to me to be the central questions of air defence,  and I leave aside a group of questions that  have occupiedmore attention than is perhaps due to them  in the past connectedwith the  internal  organisation of the Air Force and its relations to sea and land power.   I will only venture to remind you that,  after a very full and careful enquiry,  the Government has decided to con-firm the decision of its predecessors, and to maintain the British AirForce as a  single  self-contained  organisation.  I would rather  omitthis morning a description of these former controversies and attemptto give a broad picture, first, of our actual Air strength, secondly,of the responsibilities that have been placed on the Air Force owingto the strategical  changes that the advent of the air arm has intro-duced, thirdly, of the steps which we propose to take to remedy aninadequacy in air power, which I think you will all admit, and, lastly,to make some tentative suggestion as to Dominion co-operation.Strength of British Air Force.   I begin, then,  with the state of the  strength of the Air Force asit  is to-day, and I will first compare it  with the strength of the AirForce as if was at  the end of the war. The strength of the Air Forcein November 1918 was as follows:  30,000 officers, 260,000 airmenand 3,800 first-line machines.  In March of this year, at the begin-ning of this financial year, when I had to propose my estimates tothe House  of  Commons,  it was 3,000  officers, 27,000  airmen and371 first-line aeroplanes.  That is, you will see, a reduction of abouteight-ninths from  the strength as it was  at the end of the war.  .
15705Strength of French Air Force.   The French figures tell a very  different story.    The Frenchstrength in November 1918 was  3,600 first-line machines; in March1923 it was 1,260.  Our force then  is about one-ninth of the forcethat we had at the end of the war,  whereas the French force, judgedin terms of first-line machines, is over a third of what it was  at theend of the war.- That is the first point that I would venture to impress upon the Conference.Duties of Royal Air Foroe.   Next, what are the duties that the Royal Air Force is expected to perform at the present moment? There are, as I see them, three : inthe first place, co-operation with the Navy and the Army; secondly,the work of the Independent Air  Commands, as in Iraq; and, thirdly,home defence  against air attack.  Let me. say a word about each ofthese three responsibilities, and I will begin with the co-operationwork with the Navy and the Army.Co-operation with Navy and Army.   Since the war we have given priority to supplying the necessaryminimum of Air Units for co-operation with the Navy and the  Armyand for the requirements  of the British garrisons overseas.   Sixsquadrons are provided for India, three in Egypt and Palestine, and transjordan-Jordania and Aden between them have roughly the equivalent of two squadrons.  The necessary number of squadrons to keep theart of  naval aviation alive in all its forms have also been providedfor the. Fleet and arrangements made to supply the number  of air-craft  required for filling  all the aircraft-carriers  included  in theAdmiralty  programme.  By the end of the present financial yearthis will involve roughly the  equivalent of eight squadrons for theNavy.    A  small number of squadrons has also been provided  forco-operation with the Army at home.  These at present number two :we propose to increase them to about four squadrons in the coming year, but even then the number will fall much below what the army would require for co-operation if an Expeditionary Force- were sent abroad and the minimum for  that purpose  as formulated by theGeneral Staff is eight squadrons.  So much for the co-operation work with the Navy and Army.Independent Air Command in Iraq.   I come  next to the Air Force that is required for the IndependentAir Command in Iraq.  This command has constituted a consider -able part of the Air Ministry&apos;s responsibilities since the 1st October,1922,  when the primary responsibility for the garrisoning of Iraqwas transferred from the Army to the Royal Air Force.  In the lasttwo years, the number of Air squadrons has been increased concur -rently with a large reduction in the number of ground troops.  InAugust  1921,  for example,,  there  were  twenty  battalions  in  thecountry, whereas there are now six,  which number will soon  bereduced to four or five.   In the same period the number  of  air squadrons has been  raised from five to eight.   The present schemeof control  was principally due to a proposal made by Mr. Churchill,when  the late Government found the military occupation of Iraq wascosting more  in money and men than they could afford and  it wasnecessary  to find  some  cheaper  form, of  control until the Iraq Government had been more firmly established.  From the point of  . view  of the Air Ministry, the experiment of Air control in Iraq afforded the first example, on any considerable scale, of Air Forces being used not merely to, secure predominance in.the air over other- Air Forces, but for the partial  substitution of operations by the AirForce for operations carried out by  military units on land.  The Air Ministry can, I think, claim that this  experiment has fully justified the expectation that was placed upon it.  I could give the Conference a-number of testimonies  and opinions of impartial observers, such as the High  Commissioner for Iraq, bearing out  the fact that the         * experiment has been successful.  I will content myself with only one, made by Sir Percy Cox, before he relinquished the post of High Com- missioner.  &quot;It is not an exaggeration,&quot; said Sir Percy Cox una despatch,  &quot;to say that,Air action  among the Euphrates tribes has saved far  more human lives than it has destroyed, by restoring order and preventing tribal fighting.&apos;&apos; In most cases, the fear of Air action has been sufficient to preserve peace.
 Home Defenoe against Air Attaok.    I come next to what is much the most important of these three responsibilities, the question of home defence against  air attack. Well, it may surprise the Conference to be told this, but it appears td be the fact, that until two years  ago, no responsibility for home defence against air attack was placed upon the Air Force, and until eighteen months ago no provision of any kind was  made for home defence.  When the Navy and Army requirements were met and the squadrons provided for the Air Command in Iraq, and provision made for training in Great Britain, the machines left for home defence in Great Britain were altogether  insignificant.    I may give as  an instance of this insignificance the fact that a few months ago at the height  of the  Turkish crisis, when we had  sent two Royal Air Force squadrons to Constantinople, we were  left  with only twenty-four first-line machines actually available for home defence  against  air attack. Comparison between British and Frenoh Air Strength.    This state of affairs was sufficiently  serious in  itself, but it was  made more serious by the air  policy of our neighbours,  the French.  In France, instead of reducing their Air  Force by eight- ninths, as we did at the end of the war, they reduced it by less than two-thirds, and since, then very large  sums of money have been spent upon the development of aviation  in  all its branches,  and great efforts  made to  increase  not  only  the  efficiency  of  the existing force,  but  actually to increase it  in quantity.   For  the purposes of  comparison I  give the figures in machines,  owing to the  difference  between  the constitution of  British and French squadrons, but by a machine I mean a first-line machine, with&apos; all that goes behind it  in the  matter  of  personnel,  reserves  and administration.  Taking that basis of comparison, the number of first-line machines available  in France  to-day,  excluding naval machines, is 956, of  which 860 are army co-operation machines, that is, machines attached  definitely to various military  formations, and 596 machines in the Division aerienne, that is to say, in what has  come to be known  as the French Independent Striking  Air Force 596  machines  in  the  French Independent Striking   Air Force.  In addition, there  are 70 machines in different parts of  the world with the French Navy,  and  180 machines in  North Africa, to say nothing of machines in Syria, Indo-China, and elsewhere. These  machines in North Africa could, in the view  of the Air Staff, be  self-supporting for  at least  three months, and could drop from 10 to 15 tons of bombs daily upon Gibraltar, but I will not elaborate the  Mediterranean side  of the defence problem as  I  am dealing for the moment with the home  defence of Great Britain.  Moreover, a programme has been introduced in the Chamber and received with approval by  the French  public for nearly doubling  the French military air  force, for recreating the French  Naval  Air  Service and for  increasing  the  Colonial  Air  Services.    The  programme of expanding the  French  Army  Service has  passed the  Military Committee of  the  Chamber,  but  has not  yet gone through  the succeeding  stages  of  legislation.   If and  when  it is put  into operation,  the French military service will  be doubled  and  will reach a strength of over 2,000 first-line machines. As to the French Naval  Air Service, a Bill has been introduced, but has not yet been passed by the Naval Committee of the Chamber, for the purpose of creating  a  Naval  Air Service of  over  500  first-line machines. Supposing this expansion is carried out, the French Air Service as a whole would reach a strength of  about  2,600  machines,  of which some  1,800  would be military machines actually  in France,  and over 500 would be&quot; machines attached  to the French Navy.  It is uncertain as to when  and as  to how this full programme of., expansion will be carried out.  The disparity, however,  between the French and  British  forces  is -overwhelming  even  at  the  lowest  estimate that can be given and even with the actual figures as they  are.  Frenoh Machines available for Attack on England.     I assume only the actual strengths as they are without any French  expansion at all.  There are to-day 866  machines in France that,  in the view of the Air Staff,  are  available for attack upon these  shores, as against 80 machines, and I am making a  very liberal
estimate in that connection, as against 80 machines in Englandactually formed, actually organised, which could be used for homedefence, even including the units attached to the army for army co-operation.  Assuming that three-fourths  of  the  Trench  army co-operation squadrons were not engaged elsewhere and were there-fore available for  attack upon. England, no less than 168 tons of bombs could be  dropped over London during the first twenty-four hours of their attack and 84 tons a day  continuously after the first day.   Suppose,  however,  that  the General Staff  is  correct  in considering that  the army co-operation squadrons would be otherwiseengaged, and only the French Independent Striking  Force  of  596machines  could  take part  in an  attack  upon London, even  so,105  tons of bombs could be dropped during the first twenty-fourhorns of attack,  and 50 tons a day after the first twenty-four hours for an indefinite  time.  Now it will be remembered that the heaviestweight of bombs dropped in England during the late war in  one month was 12 tons; that is to say, 1,500 tons of bombs could, atthe lowest estimate, be dropped in the course of a month, whereas,12 tons was the greatest amount  that was  dropped during the late war,  that  is to  say,  more  than  100  times  the  amount.   Adispassionate observer,  Lord Balfour,. expressed the  opinion in  aCommittee of Imperial Defence paper that, &apos;&apos; In these circumstancesLondon would be uninhabitable, probably in fact-certainly in  theopinion of those who now dwell there.&quot;   I cannot help  rememberingin this connection tho remarks that were made by Mr. Bruce,  two days  ago,  with reference  to the  effect of the  rupture of  our communications  for the purposes of supplying these islands withfood, and applying them to the not-dissimilar situation created bythis air menace,  &quot; We certainly think if a disaster occurred in GreatBritain&quot; I venture to quote Mr. Bruce&apos;s words &quot;We people inAustralia think that would  be really a greater disaster to Australiaalmost than to Great  Britain.&quot;British Means of Defence.   Against this  overwhelming air force we have only,  even now,some 80 machines which could be made available,  that is to say,a disparity of 1 to  10, if three-fourths of the French army co-opera-tion  squadrons  are included,  and  1  to 8  if they are  excluded.Moreover, our evidence goes to show that whilst we are  still more efficient than  the  French,  taking  man  for man and machine  for machine, the French have made great improvement from the pointof view of efficiency since the war, and, in any case,  I venture tosuggest  that  a disparity of this kind is overwhelming.   It shouldalso  be  remembered that, in all the ancillary sections of aviation,France is  greatly superior in quantity to ourselves.   For instance,in the matter of civil machines,  whatever may be their military value, and setting aside for a moment  the debatable question  asto how  far they can  be used  in  military action or how  far theycannot,  at the beginning of the present  year France had  some 660civil   machines  against  our  167.   To  take  another  basis   of comparison,  the  capacity of the two countries to produce aircraft France last year produced 8,300 new machines, military and civil,whereas we only produced 200.   In the French industry again at the end of last year there  were about 9,000 men  employed,whereas in our small  industry in .the United Kingdom at this datethere were only  2,500.Recent Measures to strengthen Home Air Defences.    Well, I  think I have said enough, in view of these figures,  toshow that our Air Force has up  to the present been  altogetherinadequate in point of quantity to carry out its main responsibilityof home defence against  air attack.   Accordingly,  about twelvemonths  ago,  I obtained approval  from Mr.  Bonar Law&apos;s Gov^rn-ment&apos;to proceed  with  a proposal that had already been sanctioned,in principle, byMr.  Lloyd George&apos;s Government,  for an increaseof fifteen squadrons,  making  eighteen with the  three alreadyformed.   Even so, it seemed to me that the disparity was over-.whelming.   Mr.  Bonar  Law  took the  same view,  and  shortly afterwards appointed a sub-committee of  the Committee of ImperialDefence to investigate the whole question,  and, as a  result of the deliberations  of  that Committee, the Cabinet agreed  to a further     [10802]                                             JJ
development to  the  extent of 34 more squadrons, that is  to say,our programme of expansion  is 52 squadrons, 34 plus 18, for homedefence.   Putting it  in terms of machines, that will give us a forceof about  600 machines as against the  600 machines of trie  FrenchIndependent Striking Force.  It leaves out of account the machinesthat might be  diverted  from  the  army  co-operation squadrons in  France  for  an  air  attack,   and   it   sets  up  a  forceof approximately numerical equality with the French IndependentStriking  Force of 600 machines, but there  are certain  points  inconnection with  this  expansion to which I should like  to make someallusion.   It is  intended  that our home  defence  units should notbe  all  regular units, but should be recruited, as  far  as possible,from non-regular sources  with a large amount of the non-technicalduties  carried out by civilians.  I can give the Conference further details as to that expansion if  they so  desire it,  but  the  point I wish to impress upon the Conference is that, with the comparison  of600 British  machines against the 600 French Independent striking force machines, we are comparing a substantial number of machines.that will be manned  with non-regular personnel against a force thatis exclusively regular.Standard to be Equality with nearest Striking Force.    The Government, however, admitted that we must definitely take as our standard equality  with the&apos; nearest striking force.   Let mequote the salient sentence from the Prime Ministers announcement in the House of  Commons last July.  &quot;British  air  power  must include a Home Defence  Force  of sufficient strength adequately  toprotect us against air attack from the nearest Force within  strikingdistance  of  this country.&apos;&apos;&apos;  The  implication of  this  statement,although naturally the Government  did not wish to over-emphasiseit in their statement in the  House  of Commons,  is  that we mustexpand further if we find  that these  600. machines are not sufficientand that accordingly the expansion must be so arranged as to make further expansion possible and  easy.  The first stage  therefore  inremedying our disparity is this creation of a Home Defence Force of600 machines.   Even so,  we should only  have a two-thirds  ratio  tothe French Air  Force in  France, if  the French Army Co-operationSquadrons are included, and  further, whilst all their squadrons Willhe regular,  a  substantial  number  of   ours  will  be cadre  and auxiliary.Time needed to attain Standard.    This  expansion must  take a considerable  time, and during theperiod of  expansion we  shall  remain  in a comparatively  weakposition  with all its  military and diplomatic implications.   I would desire  to draw the attention  of  the Prime Ministers particularly  tothis fact.  If we proceed normally we.shall  take a minimum, so faras the Air Staff can at present see,  of five years to carry it out.  Imay say in that connection that the actual point  has not yet beenconsidered either by the  Committee of Imperial Defence  or by theCabinet, but the Air Staff have worked out  the framework of theprogramme, and, try  as  they  will,  it seems  almost impossible  tocarry  out the  programme more quickly,  if  normal  peace timemethods are to be adopted.  After all, it  is a very big  and  difficult problem  that we are trying to solve.  We are virtually doubling theAir Force and unfortunately we  have to make this.expansion-upon avery  narrow base.  The  demobilisation  of the Air  Force  was  socomplete at the  end  of the war,  and  theproposals that were  adopted for creating a peace time Force were of  such a narrow kind, thatthe base that has  been left to us for expansion is a very small one,and it therefore makes particularly difficult the expedition of thisextensive programme.Difficulties  over Expedition.    The  principal  difficulty  is  the  difficulty of. personnel, forunfortunately we are finding  that  in peace-time it is practically impossible to attract to the  Air Force rthe  highly -skilled technicallabour .that is required for it.  That means that we have to train ourhighly skilled technicians from boyhood.   We have to rtake them  asboys when they leave the secondary schools and give ,them a threeyears&apos; training.   That is one of  the  examples that I venture to give you,to show the kind of difficulty against which we find ourselves  inthe matter of producing  the skilled personnel quickly.  There  is
 another difficulty, there, is the great difficulty in peace time it may sound not a very great one, but none the less it is a very real one  of providing aerodromes and the ground organisation. Unfortunately when the Air Force  was demobilised the greater part of the  aero- dromes were given up, and there are all sorts of difficulties in peace time, that you were not  up against in war time, in  either resuming possession of those not inconsiderable tracts of land or of obtaining new aerodromes.  I quote those two instances  not to suggest that they  raise difficulties that are  necessarily insuperable, but to  show you the kind of practical difficulty that we are up against as soon as we embark upon big expansion.  There is the further difficulty, and this is the  last  one that I should like to mention, you might say : &apos;&apos; Well, why not increase your pay and attract into the Force your highly  skilled  technicians by  offering them a very  high wage?&quot; Well,  as  soon as you do that your action immediately reacts  upon the whole of the personnel already in the Air Force, and  it  would also inevitably,react  upon the  personnel in  the two bigger Forces, the Army and the Navy.   I have mentioned to you these difficulties, for at first sight you may be  surprised and possibly  disappointed when I tell you that it will take so long,  so far as the Air Staff can now see,  to double the Force and to  build up these fifty-two Home Defence Squadrons. Restatement of Main Features of Position.    I  would then venture to ask the  Prime  Ministers to give  their attention  to these  two points that I have been trying to emphasise. First  of all, our great inferiority in the  air in the  face of France. I think that must be  admitted from the figures that  I have  given you.   Secondly, the  considerable period of  time during which,  so far as we  can see, this inequality with all its implications,  military and diplomatic,  is likely to continue. Possibility of Reduction of Air Armaments.    In view of this serious state of affairs and of the sombre  prospect that it holds out before us, you may ask, as I have very often  asked myself:  Is it  possible to reduce air armaments by  international agreement on the analogy of the Washington Conference in  the case of battleships?  Well, I  say quite frankly that  I am  most anxious that a reduction of that kind should be made, if possible, but I think the Conference  should not be blind to the very  great practical difficulties, particularly at the present moment, that there are in the way of carrying through  an international agreement  of that  kind. I will not  elaborate them, though of course I can do  so if the Prime Ministers  desire to press me.  I will only mention one or two of them  in passing. . There is the great  difficulty, a difficulty that did not exist in the case of an easily definable unit like the battleship  there  is the great difficulty in the  case  of  Air of distinguishing between military and civil machines.   Again, there is the difficulty of defining what proportion of Air a  particular country  should be allowed in view  of its imperial  and international responsibilities, as compared with what amount of Navy  or Army it should be allowed. Further, and perhaps at this moment this is the greatest difficultyof all, there is  the  fact that  at the moment, unlike  the  case of washington, where  we had a  programme  of four battleships, wehave  got nothing to bargain with.  We  should go into the Confer- ence at this moment with an  Air Force so insignificant behind us that we should have  nothing  in our hands at all, and it&apos;7 would appear palpable  to the other parties of the Conference that our chief reason for entering it was to avoid the necessity of expanding ourvery  inadequate Air  Force.   However, speaking  generally, the Government are most anxious to see an agreement ;.for a reduction of air  armaments, but at the present moment they  see little likelihood of successfully carrying it into  effect.  There then is the air situa-tion,  and  I should be extremely grateful to  hear the  views of theDominion Prime Ministers and  to receive -any help and suggestion^that they  may offer.Co-operation with Dominions.   In the  Air Staff paper  I venture to make a  number of specificsuggestions as to the training of Dominion officers in the Royal AirForce  organisation.   May  I make  myself quite  clear  upon  that point?x I  have not the least desire to attempt to press a policy of
centralisation upon the Dominions.  All that has been in my mindin making those suggestions is  that the Prime Ministers may find that with their comparatively small Air Forces, as  in  the nature ofthings they will probably be, the overhead expenses for training andfor technical and expert development  may  be  so great as to makethe  cost almost  prohibitive,&apos; and it  occurred  to me  that with ourtraining facilities here, both elementary, higher and Staff, we might,by means of an agreed system of co-operation, be able to help you inavoiding anyhow some of those heavy overhead charges.  From ourown point  of view it would be extremely valuable  to  maintain thecontinuity  of ah training and air strategy  by  having a number ofDominion  pilots  working, being traingd and doing- perhaps highercourses in connection with  the Eoyal Air Force  here.   I  have,however,  elaborated these suggestions at greater length in the AirStaff paper, and I  should be  extremely grateful  if  the Prime.Ministers would  see their way to taking them up  with me, eitherindividually or collectively,  according as they may  desire.    Speaking generally, I can say that the greater  the developmentof the Dominion Ah Forces the better it  will be for us and theeasier it will be to solve our problems.   In the  event of a european war whilst, quite obviously, the first brunt  of the Air attack would fall  upon these shores,  subsequent reinforcements of the british air  forces by Dominion  pilots  would come in a  most invaluableform and at a  most critical  moment.  It is for the Dominions, ofcourse,  to  decide  how best  to develop their own air forces.Yalue of Development in Civil Aviation..    But may I say, in passing, I have been very much  struck by thesuccess of  the development in certain Dominions of  the air forces for  civil purposes.   There,  are several  instances of that.   the instance that I  have particularly in  mind  is the  forestry andsurvey work that I understand has been done in Canada.  No doubtthere are other instances of the  same kind in other Dominions;and it seems to me that; whilst in this country, where the attackwill be sudden and overwhelming and where also, for civil purposes,distances are very short, our air force has to be mainly trained upondefinitely military lines,  in the Dominions,  where  the distancesare great,  and where it would appear  that  there is little likelihood of a sudden  overwhelming  air  attack, it may  well be found that,both on the  grounds of economy  and,general efficiency, you may desire  to develop, at any  rate,  some part of your air force in peacetime upon such lines as would  make it possible to use it for, say,survey or the carrying of mails.  But there, again, I would suggestthat, if the Prime Ministers  desired it, we might take up questionsof that sort  in greater  detail possibly in  individual conferences.In any case, from what  I have said,  it will be seen that  the AirForce  is  the  only arm  that can  be  used productively in  peacetime.  But, as I  say, I am only too anxious  to take up that sideof the question with the Delegations in greater detail.Conclusion.    Well, I have  tried to give the Conference,  in as short a time asI  could, a description of the present Air  situation as  it presentsitself to me.  The figures that  I have given speak for themselves.I  do not wish  to exaggerate  the  magnitude  of  the  air  menace;neither, however, can I honourably or safely underrate  it.   It is aBerious menace.   For the first time in many centuries the capital of  the  Empire  is not invulnerable,  and it must  take  some  timeto make it invulnerable.  It is a very serious state of  affairs.   But,just as the sea arteries of the  Empire must be kept  safe and  free,so  must the heart of the Empire be  kept intact  and secure  fromsudden attack.    &quot;One  of the  great factors  of the next war,&quot; and  here I amquoting the  words of Marshal  Foch,  &quot;will obviously be aircraft.The potentialities of aircraft on a large scale are almost incalculable.It is clear that such an attack, owing to its crushing moral effect upona nation,  may  impress public  opinion to,  the point  of disarmingthe Government and thus become decisive.&quot;    Mr.  Baldwin: General Smuts,  I  think  it  would  be  veryappropriate if you began  the discussion, as you were the.Chairmanof the Committee of the War Cabinet which&apos; investigated the questionof an  Air  Ministry  and  was responsible for setting it up.
  STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER  OF  THE UNION                      OF SOUTH AFRICA.    General Smuts: I wish to confine  myself to  some practicalobservations.   We have listened  now  to  four most  informativestatements in this  Conference about the defence position generally in this country.  I am very sorry that 1 did not have the privilege of hearing Lord Beatty&apos;s  address yesterday&apos;afternoon, but I amtold by those who attended at  the Admiralty that  it was  a  mostimpressive and informative statement.Defence Position in South Africa.    I shall not refer to the  South African position.   We generallycomply with the test  which Lord Derby has laid down, that, inthe first instance, we can look after ourselves, and generally we areprotected  also  by  our  geographical  position;  so that we need notdeflect too much of our financial energy into mere military questions.That is the happiness  of our position.Unity of Air Force commended.    I was  very glad to hear that  the unity of the Air  Force  as asingle self-contained organisation, had been  decided  upon,  or  had been once more reaffirmed by  the British  Cabinet.   I think,  ifI may say so, that that is as wise a step as they could have taken.I remember  during the  years  of  the  war,  when we had separateAir Forces, they were  competing with each other  and were  unableas separate forces  to obtain proper efficiency.  I was asked  by theGovernment  at the time to  undertake  this work, and after a greatdeal of trouble and a great deal of negotiation we succeeded in establishing the single Air  Force.   I  always look upon that  withpride,  as  one of the best - services that, I rendered to this country during  the time that  I  had the honour  to be  associated with it.The result of that single organisation was that before the end of thewar this country was as  far ahead of any other country in  the airas she was on the sea,  and I am sure that, if we  were to  destroy thesingleness of the Air Force, we  would in time of difficulty be facedwith exactly the same  situation; we should have to scrap our peaceservice and we would have to go back upon the single Ah Force oncomore.   It  has proved  itself in  war, and I hope  it will maintainitself in peace.Danger of Present Position as regards Armaments.    The state  of affairs which  has been  disclosed  by the variousstatements made to us here in this Conference forms  a curious,and, I may say, a terrible commentary upon the peace.   We madea peace which was intended  to lead to disarmament;  we  had  specialdisarmament clauses put into the Covenant, and we have learnedduring the last few  days the state the world is  actually in. We see,instead of disarmament, that   the  armaments  of the   world  are actually on the increase.  I may  say this,  that  this country,  atany rate,  has  acted in good faith; it may have  gone  too  far; itmay have taken too grave risks in disarming and  in carrying out thepolicy which  was laid down  at the Washington Conference;  but nonne will ever be able to  say that, whatever happens as the resultof what has been done, this  country has not acted in good faith.    Our allies,  our  associates,   have not done  the  same.   Theyevidently  have had a  different conception of  loyalty to  the peace treaty from what we have had, and the result is what we  have heardto-day as  to the state of armaments in the world.No immediate Naval or Military menace to Empire.    I am not  going to go into general questions.  I want to confinemyself to a few practical points.  After all, much of this  continentalarmament  does not concern us very directly and need not causeus any particular alarm.  The question that I ask myself is,  whereis the menace to us in all this?  That is the practical direct questionwhich we, as an Empire, have  to answer.  In  all this  armamentaround us, what is the menace to us, and where does it come  in?I take it that  there is no direct military menace in the first instance.The French armies, gigantic and  bloated as.they are,  the  armiesthat we see arising all over the continent, are not in the first instanceA direct menace to us.  Nor do I see that we are menaced  on the sea.
   The  British Navy  is still our first line of defence.  It is still the   most incomparable instrument of  war in the world.  It probably   has  a  greater  relative  superiority to-day than  it  has ever had   in the  whole history of  this Empire.   Now that the German navy   has gone to. the bottom  of the sea, I am sure that the superiority   of the  British navy is greater than  it has ever been  in its whole   history.  So  that there  is no direct military menace  to us,  there   is no direct naval menace to us.  We may have, of course, to take   special precautions  as we are doing in Singapore.  I do not look   upon the situation in the Par East as any  menace to us  at all.   It may be that in the cause of ordinary prudence,  and acting on   far-sighted considerations, we  have to go in for an expenditure like   Singapore.   There  is no  menace there.  It may  be  something in   the far-distant  future that may occur.   Air Menace from France.      Where is  the menace to us? I must say, Prime Minister, that   1 have listened to-day to  the air statement made by  the Secretary for   Air with very grave concern.  I think that that statement is as grave   a  statement as could possibly be made about the defensive position   of this country.  It is really an appalling state of affairs to think that   if anything were to go wrong and anything may go wrong, we know   the state the  world is in to-day, statesmen are not  really sane, they   behave in a way which seems  an outrage to ordinary  commonsense   and you do not know what in a precipitate moment they may not do.   What is the state of affairs? In this country we have now, I under-   stand,  eighteen machines to defend ourselves against an organised   independent air force of 600 a short distance away.      Sir Samuel Hoare: Eighty machines.     - General Smuts: Three squadrons?      Sir Samuel Hoare: Putting in squadrons working with the army,   we think we might scrape together eighty machines.      General Smuts: Take it at that 80 to 600;  eighty machines   scraped together from all the oddments that you can collect in this   country, and match them against an organised independent air force,   organised for attack abroad, of 600 machines.   I think that that is   as appalling a state of affairs as I have ever listened to.   I do not   think this country  has ever been exposed to greater peril than it is   now.   Need for Balanced Defence.      The Pirst Lord spoke the other day of a balanced defence.  That   is what I agree with.  In this country we should not run away with   any particular line of defence, neither in the air nor  on the sea nor on*  land.   Where is the balance?  Here we are, absolutely exposed.  If   anything were to go wrong, attack would be launched against London   and the other important centres in the south,  such as  those the Air   Secretary has described.  I do not think that is a position which ought   to be tolerated  much longer.   It  is not only the great numerical   superiority which has been achieved by Prance, but it is the way she   can keep it up.  At  the end of the war this country was the undisputed   master in  the&apos;air, and  it was  my idea at the  time  that whatever   happened we  would maintain that, that we would look upon the air   service with the same pride as we look upon the navy.  It is the proud   boast of this country that  its navy is the first in the world and will   remain the first in the world.  Though we may have adopted the one-   power standard, it is our wish and idea and pride that it shall remain   the first navy, not only  in numbers but in efficiency.   We were in   exactly the same favourable position in the air, but where are we   to-day? We  have listened to  this tale of woe and we  see how our   friends speak to us. Our friends know this, they know that they can   strike  a deadly blow before we could ever dream of organising a   defence.  They know it; and these people take advantage of every   favour  that is on their side.  The result is that our diplomacy becomes   ineffective, we are exposing the country to an enormous risk, we are   absolutely exposing ourselves.   Where is the balance?  We  may   have the most powerful  navy, but it will not  help us a bit.    This   country here  may be submerged from the air before the navy could
be of any use at all.   I speak strongly because I am sure that I amright. I  am sure of it from what I have seen in  the last war  and what I have seen here in London, when not 600  or 100 machinesbut two machines came over, and half the population was driven topanic.Immediate Aotion against Air Menace urgent.   I  know, what will happen in this place if 100 machines effect anentrance into this area and start dropping bombs  on the scale theAir Secretary has described.  Anything might happen then.  If wehave  pride in this Empire and if we look upon it as the greatest inthe world, as something which is really for  the good not only of ourown people but of the world at large, I think we ought not to toleratea state of affairs like this.  It should never have been brought about,but there  it is and we must do the best under the circumstances.  Iwould not submit to this menace.  That is the menace, and I wouldnot submit to it any longer than is necessary.  The Air Secretary hasnot told us anything about air defences, that may have been  worked out,  but  I think we ought to do so.   I do not say go in for vastexpenditure, but do so.  We had a very efficient scheme for London,and if that scheme were kept alive-   Lord Salisbury: It  has been worked out.   General Smuts : Not only for London?   Lord Derby: It is on a very small scale.   General  Smuts: Wes cannot submit to this menace.   At the  endof five years, even, we shall not be equal to Prance.  We would thenbe within two-thirds of her present position.    After five years ofdesperate  effort we shall be within two-thirds of the present strengthof Prance.  We are told that Prance has authorised a further expan-sion which will double her air force.   Sir Samuel Hoare: If I may correct, it is not quite as much asthat.  The proposals have gone through certain stages.&quot;   General Smuts : Yes.  They are not through, but they are there.These things are contemplated,  and if there is to  be a race in theair we have lost so much way.   The position of danger to us  will be such a prolonged one,  for five years  at least, that I think  we  are running the gravest risk, and we must  remove the menace.Suggestions for Action.   We cannot  remove it now  by an  accelerated air policy,  theSecretary for Air has explained  to us the very grave difficulties inthe way of acceleration, but I think we can do a great deal to work outschemes of anti-aircraft defence,-not only for London but for other-vital  centres in  the  south of  this  country, which  may,  in anemergency,  prevent the direst calamity. I hope that that  will bedone.  That, at any rate, does not require five years, but can be donein a short time, skeleton defences^ properly worked out by the staff,which can be brought  into operation  within a week or two  weeks.That is the first thing that I would do.  The second is that I wouldaccelerate the programme,  authorised twelve months ago, of anadditional fifteen squadrons.   I can imagine that the balance of thirty-five squadrons which has now been authorised may take a longtime to complete,  but  the fifteen squadrons authorised  some timeback by the late Government ought, I think, to be pushed on with ashard  as possible.  Do not let us look  upon the programme as awhole and delay the  one part in order to execute the whole, let ushurry on  the earlier part  of the programme  as  fast as possible inorder that there may be something.   Of course it is our policy to work in favour of disarmament, andwe must do it.  But I agree with the Air Secretary that, while we arein this exposed position and our possible opponents have acquiredthat immense and undisputed superiority, they would not listen tous with very much seriousness, they know -where they are, and they know they will have oia, and I  do not think it will be much  usespeaking to ^them, dn case we have to talk to them.Present Risks too great.   All I want to say is this, that we are running a risk that thiscountry cannot afford,  either from the peace point of view or from
 the war point of view.   After all, defence is not a war weapon, it is a peace weapon.  Properly arranged, defence is the most powerful. weapon that your diplomacy can have.  Our friends over the Channel know perfectly well that we are superior on the  seas, and they know that their armies are no menace to us any more than the German armies or the armies of Napoleon were  a menace to us.  But they know  we can  be caught  napping  at a vital, point,  and it  may happen in a fortnight.  It  may take  a long time to defeat a country on. land or to chase  her navy into  defeat, but this is a different thing.   This  disaster  could be brought  about in a  week  or a. fortnight.  You may destroy the morale of this people and other great centres to such an extent that after  a fortnight the thing is- over.  We dare not run this risk.   It  is  a very good thing that public opinion does not know this.   People sleep in peace here at night.  But the most urgent precautions (should be taken, arranged in  skeleton, for all  the vital points in the Southern  part of this Kingdom, and that should be done without delay.  We should be able to say to ourselves, honestly and sincerely :  Now there is something in the background.    Lord Derby : Are you speaking of anti-aircraft as opposed to air machines?    General Smuts : Yes; I  am speaking  of the anti-aircraft gunnery arrangements  here in London, which practically kept the German force out of it; the Germans could only enter by two or three at a time.  I have spoken strongly,  Prime Minister, but I am sure that my experience  and instinct perfectly justify the  strong remarks Ihave  made. Question of Adjournment.    Mr.  Massey: May  I  suggest  that the   discussion  be  now adjourned?  It is very unfortunate,  but there  are three Ministers sitting here who have agreed to go to a function to-day.   As a matter of fact we are a quarter of an hour overdue now.    Mr. Baldwin: We will do that, Mr. Massey.    Mr. Massey : I am very sorry to have to suggest it, but I see no way out of it.    Mr. Baldwin: I quite see the point.                     FUTURE  BUSINESS.    There is the question of  the attitude of the United States towardsthe &quot; C &quot; Mandates,  and it  is suggested that that should be referredto a Committee, consisting of the Secretary of State for the Colonies,the Secretary  of State for  Foreign  Affairs, and representatives ofCanada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and the time ofthe meeting will be communicated by the Secretary.    It has been suggested also that the question of the United StatesLiquor Traffic should be referred to Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee whichis now sitting and dealing with the question of treaties and territorial waters.  The two  matters  seem  to be akin.   Then  there  is thequestion of the Indian contribution to the League of Nations, whichmight be referred to a Committee consisting of the Secretary of Statefor the  Colonies,  the Lord Privy  Seal,  the  Chancellor  of theExchequer, the  Secretary  of State for Foreign  Affairs or  repre-sentative, and representatives of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, The Irish Free State and India.    I think the  Maharajah  wishes to say a  word to-day before theConference adjourns.ADDRESS BY  THE MAHARAJAH OF ALWAR IN HONOUR            x OF THE DUSSEHRA FESTIYAL.    The Maharajah of Alwar: Prime Minister and Friends, it  is acurious coincidence, I hope  a happy coincidence, that to-day in thisroom we should be discussing questions  relating to Military, Navaland Air matters, all  connected with the  defence of the Empire, onthe exact day when in India is being celebrated our greatest festivalof the year.   It is a festival to  commemorate the march of Shri Earn, one ofour greatest incarnations, to Ceylon where he achieved victory.   the anniversary  is  celebrated  nowadays  in India in inspecting  our
Military troops and Units, in other words examining the means ofwar, or, more correctly speaking, the means of peace.   We  may thus in a sense he celebrating the Dussehra, festivalto-day by examining the means of Defence of our Empire.   j   Friends, I wish you all in the name of my country as an Indian,in the name of the Princes as one of their Order, our cordial andsincere Dussehra greetings to each and all of you.   Let us hope that this quiet, almost unostentatious, work that weare doing; or trying to do, will lead to co-ordination and co-operationof all the forces of the Empire to secure real peace, not only within,but also without.   Mr.  Baldwin:  I am quite sure the Conference are very grateful for those words.   The  Conference then adjourned to Monday afternoon.   2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,         October 19,  1923.                         APPENDIX I.                               (i.)                   If &apos;,  The Marquess Gurzon of Kedleston to Mr. Chilton (Washington). (No. 299.)           Foreign Office, October 12,  1923, 2&apos;30 P.M. (Part 1.)    THE information which reaches America will have acquainted the  American Government with the  extremely  critical  economic position that has arisen in Europe,  owing to the failure to find any solution for the  reparations problem,  which  daily becomes more acute  as  the financial  and political condition of Germany grows worse.  There does not appear to be among the  European Powers that unity of thought which either  renders common action feasible or will be successful in finding an early  solution.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government have during the past  nine months  made a  series  of proposals to their allies for meeting  these difficulties, none of which has  been so fortunate  as  to meet  with a measure of acceptance. sufficient  to  bring about common action.   And. yet, without such action,  not merely Germany, but Europe, appears to be  drifting into economic  disaster.  In these circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment have for long entertained the belief that the co-operation  of the United States Government is an essential condition of any real advance towards  settlement.  America, by reason  of her position and history, is more disinterested than any of the European Powers. At the  same time,  she is  directly  and  vitally  concerned  with the solution of the European problem, if for no other  reason because in it is  involved the  question of the inter-Allied debt.^(Part 2.)   When Mr. Hughes  made his declaration in December last, both Great Britain and Germany made it clear that  they would warmly welcome the proffered assistance; and whenever the suggestion has been revived, it has met with the hearty approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government; the French Government have hitherto taken a different view.   This lack  of unanimity is, so far as His Majesjt&apos;y&apos;s Govern- ment are  aware,  the  sole  reason why:the proposal has  not been proceeded with.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government were  already engaged in  formulatingan enquiry to the United  States Government as to the manner inwhich, in  the opinion of the latter,  the united action which is thecommon desideratum could best  be  brought about, when they readin the press yesterday morning a declaration, reported to have beenmade by President Coolidge, that the  American  Government reston their proposal of December  last.   His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwarmly welcome this declaration, and hope that they are justifiedin deducing from  it that, if the European Powers will join in suchan enquiry, America will render the  promised co-operation.     [10802]                                             B
(Part 3.).    If  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  have  rightly interpreted  thestatement  of  the  President,  and if  they  may count  upon an encouraging reception,being given to such a proceeding,  they  willnot hesitate to invite the immediate co-operation of their allies inEurope in an  invitation to the United  States Government to assist in the proposed enquiry,  by deputing a delegate,  whether official orunofficial, to take part in  it.  If, on the other hand, it were proposedto hold  such  an enquiry, although, complete  unanimity had  notbeen forthcoming at this  end, might His Majesty&apos;s Government  andthe majority  of the Allies still hope  for  American  co-operation?Alternatively,  if it  were  proposed that such  an enquiry should beentrusted to the preparation Commission  or to a body appointed by it,, would America still be willing to participate?    It is  in the firm belief that the American Government have itin their  power to render  a great  service  to the security and peace of the world that His Majesty&apos;s Government, speaking in the nameof the whole British Empire, as represented in the Imperial Confer-.ence now assembled in London, desire  to associate themselves withtbe renewed proposal of  the President,  and they will be glad toreceive from the American Government any suggestion  that  thelatter may  be disposed to offer in reply to the questions which Ihave ventured to put.   You should see the Secretary of State,.and enforce this argumentwith all  the power at your disposal.  Mr.  Ghilton to the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. (Received                      October 13, 9 P.M.)(No. 403.)  Urgent.             Washington, October 13, 1923.    I  COMMUNICATED verbally to  Secretary of  State this  morningcontents  of your telegram No. 299.  He  received  communicationin a most  friendly  manner, and said that,  -although he could not,of course, give me any definite reply before  consulting the president and Cabinet, he  could assure me that communication would receivemost  careful  and  sympathetic  consideration  by  United  StatesGovernment, and added that, speaking personally, he hoped some-thing would come of it.   Mr. Hughes said:  &quot;You  know what  my own views are  on the subject.&quot;   He further said that  he had warned  French Ambassador sometime ago that  France should renounce her obstinate attitude andcome  into line with the other Powers.   Secretary of State said he would, of course, treat my communica-tion as entirely  confidential, and he hoped no inkling..qf it wouldhe allowed to reach the press  in  England, as he did not  wish  forany publicity,  at least until the United  States Government had had time to consider and reply to your Lordship&apos;s proposals.    He  asked  me  for  an aide-m6moire  recording  what  I  had communicated to him, which I am sending  him to-day.    I had reported Presidents statement, as  given in the press ofthe 10th October, by despatch No. 1280, now  on its way to your lordship.                             (iii.)

Secretary of State has handed me a memorandum in reply  tomy communication of 18th October. Text follows in my immediately following telegram.    He said that,  while  he would of course treat the  matter asconfidential, he wished to reserve the right to publish his reply incase the  suggestion of His Majesty &apos;s Government and his answer should become  public or should  be made known  to other Powers,
and it should be  important that the attitude of the United StatesGovernment should be made clear.   He laid great  stress upon the manner in which france shouldbe approached in this matter, but he felt sure it would be done withtact and delicacy.   France should not be allowed to think that therewas any sort of understanding between Great Britain and the UnitedStates.                              (iv.)   Mr. Chilton to the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. (Received                       October 16, 9  A.M.) (No. 407.)                      Washington, October 16, 1923.    FOLLOWING is text referred  to in my  immediately preceding telegram:  (Part 1.)    Aide-rnimoire.    In reply to communication from His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Afraires of  13th October,  Secretary of State desires again to express deep interest of the United States in economic situation of Plurope, and its readiness  to aid  in any practical  way to promote recuperation and re-establishment of economic stability.  Government *of United States has viewed with deep concern the lack,  as  His Majesty&apos;s Government  expresses it, of that unity of thought on the part of [? European Powers] essential  to [? common] action.   Views of Government   of  United States  as  to importance  of   agreement amongst Allies  and relations of Government of United States to questions involved were set forth in statement of Secretary of  State, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government refers, and these views are still held.  It is  observed that [?His Majesty&apos;s  Government]  states that  [? Great Britain] and Germany  made it  clear that proffered assistance  would be warmly welcomed by  them,  and that  His Majesty&apos;s Government has always heartily approved suggestion then made by Secretary of State, whenever it has been revived, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government is aware that sole  reason why proposal has not been proceeded with has been lack of unanimity among interested Powers.    It is believed that present  conditions  make it imperative that a.  suitable  financial  plan should be evolved to prevent economic disaster in Europe,  consequences of  which would be world-wide. It is to  be hoped that  existing  circumstances  are  propitious for consideration of such a plan, inasmuch as abandonment of resistance on  the  part  of  German  Government will  present  [?a]   freer opportunity and  an  immediate necessity  for  establishment  of an economic programme.  Government of United States is,  therefore, entirely willing to take part in an economic  conference in which ali  European  Allies  chiefly  concerned  in German  reparationsparticipate, for the  purpose of  considering questions  of capacityof Germany to make reparations,  and  an appropriate financial plan for securing such payments^  It is deemed  advisable, however, toemphasise the. following points :     1. Confirming what was said by Secretary of State in his  state- ment last December, to which you refer, Government  of United States has  no desire to see  Germany  relieved  of her responsibility for war&apos; or of her  just obligations.  There should be no grounds forimpression that London Conference, if called, should have any suchaim or that resistance to fulfilment of Germany&apos;s obligations hasany support.   It should be evident that in effort to obtain ends inview regard must be had to capacity of Germany to pay, and tofundamental  condition of Germany&apos;s rehabilitation, without whichreparation payment will be impossible.    2. Such  a conference should  be advisory; ,not  for purpose ofbinding Governments, who would naturally he unwilling to pledgetheir acceptance in advance, but to assure appropriate recommendations  -tions by a thoroughly informed  and  impartial body intent  uponsolving difficult pending problems  upon their merits.    3&apos;. Secretary of  State notes  observation in communication ofHis Majesty&apos;? Government that European problem is of direct and     [10802]                                             F
vital  interest  to  United States,  &quot;if for no other reason becausequestion of inter-Allied debt is involved therein.&quot;  Government ofUnited  States has consistently  maintained  essential  differencebetween question of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay, and of practicability of methods to secure  reparation payments  from Germany,  and payment by Allies of their debts to United States, which constitutedistinct obligations.  In statement of Secretary of State, to whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government refers, it was said:        &quot; The matter is plain enough from  our standpoint.   The   capacity  of Germany to  pay is not  at  all  affected  by  any   indebtedness of any of the Allies  to us.  That indebtedness does   not diminish  Germany&apos;s capacity, and  its removal would not   increase her capacity.  For example, if France had been  able   to finance her part in the war without borrowing at all from us,   that is, by taxation and internal loans,  the problem  of what   Germany  could  pay would be exactly the same.   Moreover, so   far as the debtors to the United States are concerned, they have   unsettled  credit  balances,  and their  condition and  capacity to   pay cannot  be properly determined  until the amount that  can   be realised on these credits for reparations has been determined.      &quot; The   Administration  must   also  consider  the  difficulty   arising from the  fact that the question of these obligations which   we hold,  and  what  shall be done with them, is not a question   within tho province  of the executive.  Not only may Congress   deal with  public property of this  sort, but it has dealt  with it.   It  has created  a commission, and  instead of giving  that, commis-   sion broad powers such as the Administration  proposed, which   quite apart  from cancellation  might permit  a  sound discretion   to be  exercised in accordance with the facts elicited, Congress   has placed definite  restrictions upon the power of the commis-   sion in providing for the  refunding of these debts.&quot;   (Part 2 follows.)                              (v.)  Mr. Chilton to the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. (Received                       October 17,  9  A.M.)(No. 407.)                      Washington,  October 16, 1923.(Part 2.)    IT is hardly necessary to add, as it has frequently been stated by  United  States Government,  that,  while  American  people donot favour cancellation of debts  of  Allies to the United  States ortransfer to  people of  the  United States  of  burden of Germany&apos;obligations directly  or indirectly, United  States Government hasno  desire  to be  oppressive or to  refuse to make reasonable  settle-ments as  to time and terms of  payment  in full consideration of circumstances of Allied debts, and Under-Secretary  of State addedthat establishment of sound economic conditions in Europe, seriousreduction  of military  outlays and demonstration of a disposition of European peoples to work together to achieve aims of peace and justice will not  fail  to have their proper influence upon Americanthought and purpose  in connection with such adjustment.    In further reply to communication .of His M!ajesty&apos;s  Govern-ment,  it may be said  that United States Government is not in aposition to appoint a member of Reparation Commission, inasmuch as  such  an appointment cannot be  made  without  consent of congress.   The Secretary of State  has no  doubt,  however, thatcompetent American citizens would  be willing  to participate in aneconomic  enquiry .for the purposes  stated,  through an advisory body  appointed  by Reparation  Commission  to  make recommenda-tions,  in  case that course, after  further  consideration,  should bedeemed preferable.    As to  further  question whether American co-operation  in  an enquiry for  the purposes described  in communication  of  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government could be  hoped for in case unanimity ofEuropean  Powers could not be  had,  United  States government must  again  express  view  that question involved  cannot  be finally settled without  concurrence of  European  Governments  directly
concerned.   Other Governments  cannot  consent for them, and itwould manifestly be extremely difficult to formulate financial plans of such importance and  complexity  without  participation of&apos; those whose assent is necessary for their fulfilment.  In view of existingexigencies,  it is hoped  that  project  of such  an enquiry  as is contemplated of an advisory nature might commend  itself to allthese Powers, and that question  suggested will not  arise.  But ifit  should arise from lack of unanimity  on the part of european powers, United  States  Government must reserve decision as to itscourse of action in order  that development in such  a  contingencymay be fully  considered, and that course  taken which will give bestpromise of ultimate success in securing desired end of  re-establish-ment of essential conditions of  European  peace  and  economicrestoration.   To attainment of that end it may be repeated that united States Government  desires to lend  its assistance in anymanner that  may be found  feasible.
