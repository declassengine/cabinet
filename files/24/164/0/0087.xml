- 1 -   CTrsJ^QMBHI^IS THE PROPERTY 01 HIS BHITAEIIC MJLJBSTrS 80YMMI.                          Q  A 3 1 H I.                         / J                       W$ PLOYj MT  II3URA30B.SECRET.            MsaoRAyjUM BY THB  MXNISTM OF LABOUR.0,Po86f24).                 In my Memorandum CP. 45 (24) I put forward a            proposal to abolish tho  restriction on the grant of            Uncovenanted Benefit  to  certain classes of applicants,            particularly single men  and women residing with relatives.            The restriction  has been imposed by administrative aotion            and can be removed without legislation.                 In his Memorandum CP. 76 (24) the Chancellor urges            his colleagues to think twice before abolishing this            restriction and  gives reasons why he thinks It  should be            maintained.                 My colleagues will of oourso wish to oonsider the            Chancellors reasons vory oarefully but I  may  Bay that            bofore  putting forward my proposal, I examined  all the            arguments  whioh  I could think of or whioh were  suggested            to  me against the abolition of the  restriction,  and  oame            to  the  conclusion that the restriction could not be            defended.                 The real question is whether tho test of &quot;need&quot;,            whioh admittedly aannot bo applied  to Covenanted Benefit,            can Justifiably be applied to  Unoovenaated Benefit.  My            via.w  is that it cannot,  since  the whole of the money both            for covenanted and for unaovananted benefit   is obtained            under a contributory sohome  and  the liability to pay            contributions whilst In insurable employment is the same            for all.    In other words,  to  take  a particular case, I            do  net  see  how we oan justify  refusing  uncovenanted            benefit to  a young man whose parents  can support him and
paying it to another whose parents cannot support him, so long as both of them have to pay exactly the same contribution when they are at work.

There is the further point, that in applying the test of "need", it is almost unavoidable that the precautions and inquiries which are necessary have the effect of excluding a number of genuine cases, while the unscrupulous applicant manages sometimes to slip through.

Finally, let me point out that, as I said in my previous Memorandum, I do not intend in any way to depart from the essential requirement that no one is, to get uncovenanted benefit who is not "genuinely seeking whole-time employment and unable to obtain it". The restriction we are now considering has no doubt the effect of excluding automatically some persons who do not satisfy this requirement, but at the same time  it excludes a  great many others also. I see no reason why, through the machinery of the Local Employment Committees, it should not be possible to sift the applicants - as, in fact, it has been in the past quite apart from the restriction now in question - in such a way as to ensure that Benefit is given only to those who are really doing all they can to find work, and I should propose to keep this steadily in mind in my administration of the Act. I hope, therefore, my colleagues will see their way to agree to my proposal.

                                           

                                                          (Intd)  T.S.
