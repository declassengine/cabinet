Copy ITo.  -1 3,S.P. 9  (24).C A B I I 1 T,WOOLWICH  WAGES.   Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer..          The memorandum (C.P.3 (24)) circulated by the Secretaryof State for War contains three recommendations of which thethird proposing an increase of the minimum rate of wages tobe paid to unskilled labourers in Government industrial establishments in the London Area is the most important.          The basis for the regulation of wages in GovernmentIndustrial Establishments is the Pair Wages Resolution of the  ...House of Commons, which provides that -          &quot;The contractor shall., under the penalty of a fine or         otherwise, pay rates nf wages and observe hours of labour         not less favourable than those commonly recognised by         employersand trade societies (or in the absence of such         recognised wages and hours, those which in practice         prevail amongst good employers) in the trade in the         district where the work is carried out.   Where there are         no such wages and hours recognised or prevailing in the         district, those recognised or prevailing in the nearest         district in which the general industrial circumstanced         are similar shall be adopted.   further,  the conditions of         employment generally accepted in the. district in the         trade concerned shall be taken into account in considering         how far- the terms of the Pair Wages Clause are being         observed&quot;.                                                       This
          hie resolution,  &quot;though applying in terms only., toGoTeriT&amp;en-t Cohtractcra, lb extended to &apos;all direct employees  s &quot;of the States   It is In my opinion essential that anyde*i;Bi-b.h reached should be in accordance with the1 acceptedinterpretation of the principle underlying this Resolution.          At the present time unskilled labourers employedin the Ordnance Factorials - and in other establishments in theLondon area which are for wage purposes similarly regulated,receive a minimum rate of 44/- a -week, made up of a basic rate of 27/- plus what is left of the war time engineeringadvances, viz.17/- a veok.   Unskilled labourers in outsideengineering establishments in the &quot;London area normallyreceive the London rate of 43/3+d, as agreed bet eon theEngineering and national  Jmployers Federation and the nationalFederation of General Workers.           Prior to the war the minimum rate for unskilled labour employed in Government establishments in London --as anaverage rate fixed after a revie\&quot;; by  the Fair &apos; Tag eg Advisory .Committob of the wages paid in various trades and occupationsin the London area.           In this connection however, I would drat- attentionto three important facts -      (a)  outside of the building trade no general agreement          existed at that time between employers and Trade-          Unions regarding the remuneration of unskilled men;      (b)  the outside  rate for unskilled labour varied but          little according to occupation (the variation being          only about 3/- as compared  ;:it.h a range of nearly          30/- at the present day); ;      (c)  the Woolwich rate, though an average rate, corresponded          in fact very closely with the oUtside operative          engineering  rate.                                                     Shortly
           Shortly alter the outbreak  of war,  and following upon, the increase granted to craftsmen, the  engineering  .employers in London agreed to giro an  increase  of 2/*- per week to labourers receiving 25/- a week and less.    (Ibis  increase was not primarily a war increase, but was  in settlement  of along standing claim).            The application of this  increase to. &apos;;/ar Departmentemployees was referred to the Committee of Production in engineering and Shipbuilding establishments  and on their-recommendation was    March; 1915, oxtended to  government employees.   Prom1 this date, the wages of unskilled labourersin the Government industrial ial Es tab1ishmsnts  in  question  canbe said to have been regulated^ definitely  ojn the basis cf theEngineering Industry: &apos; they have all alike received the  full advantage&apos;of the Engineering bonus (amounting  at its peakpoint to 39/6d. plus the 12^i) and as  the engineering bonushas been reduced, they have all alike suffered  a pro&quot; tan to&quot;reduction of-wages&quot;.          It has been represented from time  to  time that,whatever justification may exist for the payment of engineer-ing rates at the Ordnance factories, there is  none for their application to store labourers, etc.,  at the Ordnance Depotsat Woolwich and more particularly at Pimlico.   I understandhowever, that this claim is not now put forward -by theworkmen&apos;s representatives; and. that even if  such a claimwere put forward, the Secretary of State for vlar would regard  it as impracticable to pay -varying  rates of pay tounskilled labourers within the same  group  of -establishments -and to  differentiate for pay purposes  between  similar Depotsin the  London Area,   Prom this viow,  I do not  dissent.                                                     As
          As  a solution of the &quot;present difficulties the-      g;j[Secretary of  State  for&apos; War suggests  that thcroasos of paynot  exceeding s/- per week should be given to all unskilleda.id  3emi-skilled  employees in  tho loud on oatablishmentc.  - Tothis  proposal I feel bound to  take exception.   In my opinionsuch  an Increase  involves  the  abandonment of the existingbasis  on  which government  wages are  regulated without sub-stituting any logical or defensible  principle for it.   Tho44/-  rate is  directly related  to the wages paid  in the mostnearly comparable Industry..    So far as I am aware a 46/*-rate has  no substantial industrial analogue-.   The Secretary  ofState  for lar holds  that the rates payable to engineeringtradesmen at Yfoolwich &quot;are as  favourable as  those current inthe outs id 0 engineoring industry&quot;., and should-thero-fo-re-notbe increased.   Accepting  this  view,  I should find: it- impossibleto arguo  in favour  of increasing,  as  tho Secretary of Statenow proposes,  the recognised rates payable at Woolwich t0unskilled labour.          It would  be imposeiblo to  confine  the  S/- increase to London Establishments;  it would have to be extended  toall comparable employees in the Royal  Dockyards  and  othorAdmiralty Establishments and possibly to industrial employees in Government  employment generally.    Indeed  it  is  impossibleto predict the full  and final  offsets  of the  step now proposed.          I estimate  the immediate cost of tho proposal to      /be not- less than   110,000  on the  assumption  that no  oonsecuon-tial  increases are  granted to  craftsmen or to  workers  employedouts id0 tha   industrial establishmentsr.          I also  deprecate any attempt boing  mado at  thopresent timo by means  of a Committee  of Enquiry  to  fix ageneral London rate for unskilled&quot;  labour,,    In this  connectionI would draw  attention to  tho  award  of  tho Industrial Courtreferred  to in tho  paper circulated by the Secretary  ofJtate  for War,  in which the opinion  is  expressod  that whilst                                                      tho....     1                           , .. .             . Ml&apos;! V
 the existing basis should not necessarily be regarded as,       g  binding for all time, any attempt  to modify it until conditions generally become more stable, must be regarded as premature.With this expression of opinion  I  find myself in full agreement..          In my opinion the rates  at present paid to unskilled labourers are in harmony with the  spirit of tho Pair vagoz re- solution of tho House of Commons, but if any doubt  is felt by my colleagues on this point, I should be prepared to agree, afterre-affirming unequivocally the Pair Wages Resolution, to refer-for settlement to tho Industrial Court a claim submitted by the employees in question for an increase in wages of a definitestated amount.            Of the other two Recommendations the first bearingupon the payment of appropriate rates of craftsmen of otherthan engineering trades appears to be a matter which can bosafely left for departmental conaidoration.           The Secretary of State further pr:oosea (a) a con-cession as to the method of reckoning overtime and (b) tho con-version of 7/- of tho existing bonus of 17/- to basic rate mak-ing the latter 34/.- instead of 27/-.            I have no objection in &apos;.)ri.nci&apos;)lo to the adoption of (b).            As regards (a) I find that the question was fully discussed, at a conference at which all departments wero repro-seated two years ago3   At that timo it was clearly established that tho object of the overtime terns imposed by tho outsideagreement wasrto limit overtime as much as  possible (overtirapbeing in tho mon&apos;a view particularly profitable to tho ooLKior-oial employer)*   It was further held that  the conditions  ofemployment in Government Establishments woro on tho wholo  morofavourable than in tho Engineering Industry generally and  the government wero unwilling to concodo this particular advan-tago unless a general review of Government  wage conditions were undertaken.   Tho Trade Union Side of  tho EngineeringCouncil wero invited to co-operate in - such  a review butwero unwilling to do so.
         I&quot; snouid&quot; hot new be inclined to oppose the concession on merits1/ V         I feel however there are&apos;two objectionr to announcingeither of these concessions at tho present time.   &quot;irst itseams to me -that&apos; the&quot; concession of two - minor claims whencoupled with a refusal of the more important .demand for higher wages trfcold be an &quot;irritant rather than a sedative.   Secondlyboth points have been considered by the  Juginearing Trade JointCounoil;  and on both the Official Side felt at the time.obliged to refuse.    I think that these Councils, generallyperform a m*vst Valuable; function in preserving good relationsbetween the Goveriment. and its industrial employees.   Ifconcessions v/hich have been refused on these Councils are granted as a result  of pressure exercised in .other directions,their authority will be undermined.    Vhile therefore I do not oppose the proposals themselves I consider that the machinery-of the Trade Joint Council should be used for bringing them intoeffect. -                                          &apos;  IT.
