S.   The Committee, after careful examination of  the            Report of the Juvenile Unemployment Committee  (0.?.483(25))            and of Memoranda put before  them by the Minister of   -            Labour and the President, of  the Board of Education,  submit            the&apos; following Conclusions and Recommendations  to the            Cabinet,            3.   The Cabinet WILL remember that Colonel  GuinaesB!8&apos;            Committee had .before them the following suggestions  for/           . alleviating the present serious HITUATIOA --arising out  of            the long continued ttnyaployniejit and confluent demoral^            isa-tion of juveniles:-                 (l)  The retention-&apos;- ct  tvhiidr-en .at.  school by the        ,;,                      raiaing of the achcc-i age of  obligatory attoniaxot                 ( )  The further extension,of  the  present. system                      of Juvenile Unemployment Centres.
     (3)  The extension of the Unemployment          Insurance-.Scheme BO as to cover  juveniles ...          from 14-10.     After dealing wit;&apos;, these three; proposals theCommittee submit their views on certain  furthersuggestions which have-been referred to  them forconsideration by the Minister of Labour  and thePresident of the Board, of Education.respectively,4.   The Committee agree generally with  the Conclusionsset out in&apos;paragraph 15 of CP  483&apos;;-2.3&apos;i  relative tothe raising cf the school leaving age.   The age couldnet be raised&apos; effectively,. even up to 15,,, without legislation.   The remedy afforded would&apos;.be a gradual*-:ne,&apos; since children already over, the age must be,  inthe main, unaffected.   The proposal would be verycostly  in itself and would if coupled with,a systemof maintenance allowances be  still more  expensive.Its adoption would meet with  great objection, tr.th fromparents and employers, and&apos;Voulo involve a completereversal of - the considered policy of the Board, ofEducation in the matter.     Having regard to  these considerations the Committeeare. unable to recommend the ,Cabinet to adopt thepolicy  ef retaining children  at;school tV  raising  thepresent/school age of  ccmpulscrv attendance. &apos;  /5.   Colonel Guinness&apos;s Committee . (CP.  495(23)paragraph 24/ recommended that the exchequer Grant forJuvenile Unemployment  Centres should be  increased  asfrom January 1st., 1924 from.75 per cent  to &apos;1C0 per cent.and that, with- a view  to securing economy and efficiency
investigations should he -undertaken forthwith by the ,Departments concerned for the purpose of- seeing whether some per.....capita grant sysicm. could not be devised for the centres which would obviate the need for central control,:6.   There are at present about 75 Juvenile UnemploymentCentres open with a total attendance of about 6;500children.  It is estimated that In all there are about150,000 boys and girls between 14 and 13 unemployed ofwhom not sore than 30,000 (all between 16 and 18) aredrawing unemployment benefit,7.   It has been strongly represented to the Committee thatthe only v;&amp;y of securing a substantial increase of thenumber of Centre? is by the Exchequer bearing the whole cost cf the service.  Anything short of this (say a 9(ypgrant) would produce little, if any, increase in thenumber of Centres.  With lOOfc grant the Committee areinformed that with the present volume of unemployment thenumber of Centres might possibly be trebled, and thenumber of boys and girls in attendance increased to,-gay,30,000 to 25,000, and the cost to between  300,000 and 350,000 per annum, as comparoci with the present charge          at the rate on the Exchequer/of - 32,000 per annum,,  i;.e..  75%- of  110,000P.   On the one hand, the serious objections to  theExchequer bearing too whole coot of ble; service must notbe overlooked.  While steps no doubt would be taken tosafe-guard the Exchequer against waste and extravaganse inthe conduct of the Centres.,.a decision to  give IGOjSExchequer Grouts at the present time would be cited asa- precedent for burdening the
Exchequer with  the whole cost  of  similar sided  services.Moreover, the position would almost necessarily involve  &apos;central control snd there would be considerable danger oflocal Authorities ceasing to interest  themselves in  the  scheme,particularly  if it was not  carried out  precisely on  lines approved by them.9.     On the other lend, the  Committee agree with  theconclusion of the Juvenile  Unemployment Committee  that theextension and development of the  Centres affords perhaps themost hopeful end economic solution of  the  problem,  and Intheir opinion the need for  extending the area covered by the centres  is so great as in the  last resort  to outweigh theserious  financial objections to  the 100$ grant.  -But theyare  not  satisfied that the  situation has been sufficientlyexplored and  while  recommending  the principle of extensionthey consider that  there  should  be some further investigation of alternative  methods.      - It is  possible  that  if the  major local  authorities wereapproached with a.  clearer statement  of the Government&apos;swishes  they might  be  induced  to  arrange for their EducationCommittees to tale  up the  provision  of Centres  by a grant  ofinitial expenses  or the  whole  cost for a limited period,thereafter bearing  a  ps?rt  of .the  cost  themselves,   Furtheruse  might also  be  n&amp;de  of existing poviers  possessed byBoards  of guardians in connection with the grant of poor.relief  and by the Minister of  labour  in connection with unemployment Benefit  to  require attendance of  juvenilesat their Centres. -^TRILLLLLLLLLLLLLIIMLLLILILLILBLLLLM^                         I I.........IN MI......I.....LINN....................
10.   The Committee accordingly recommend:-           1.  That the Minister of Health andthe               Secretary fcr Scotland respectively he               requested to make enquiries (in               consultation with the Minister of               Labour, and as regards England and.               Wales with the President of the               Board of Education,,) with a view               to ascertaining what arrangements in               connection with the provision and               working of Tentres, would be most               acceptable to Local Authorities and               most likely to enlist their willing               co-operation, it being Understood               that 100 per cent of the cost will be              &apos;borne by the Exchequer if it be               ultimately decided that this offers               the most fruitful method of attaining               the desired object.-          2i;   That with a view to securing&apos; the .               attendance of younger juveniles at               the Centres the Minister of Health               ahd the Secretary for Scotland              &apos; should-take such steps as they&apos;may               think&apos;best&apos; to exhort: Boards of               Guardians in England and Wales and               Parish Councils&apos; in Scotland               respectively to make use of their               power to withhold relief (wholely               or  in&apos;part, from the parent r.f an                                 II:&apos;

That the Minister pf Labour should    consider how far it is possible to    relax the existing rule which    prohibits the payment of Uncavenanted    Benefit to young persons who can be    maintained by their parents or    relatives so as to allow suoh    TJncovenanted Benefit, to be paid to.    those juveniles between l6 and l8    who attend at Juvenile Unemployment    Centres,4.  That investigations should be    undertaken forthwith by the Depart-    ments concerned with a view to       .  .    seeing WHETHER some per, CAPITA    grant system could not be devised    for the Centres WHICH would obviate    the need^ for detailed central    control.
REDUCTION OfMIHI1UM AGE FOB UHEMELOY-MEHT IHSURAHCE.OTHERPROPOSALSSUBMITTED TO.XX..   The Committee- are -informed by the Minister ofLabour that ha does not think it is feasible to press at the. present. juncture the suggestion that theminimum age for unemployment insurance should boreduced to 14, for the following reasons,-       The proposal requires on merit very       full and careful consideration from many       points of view.  It will be liable to       criticism, as a device for throwing fresh      ,burdens on the worker by bringing in a      &apos; o.lass where employment is usually fairly       good into OOntrifration; and, in any event,      .&apos;:LF desirable on merits it could only be       Introduced at  the time of, and as part of       the overhauling and possible adjustment of  the       Unemployment insurance Scheme, which will have      - TO be&apos; undertaken when times become more normal.IB,-  The Committee, concur in these observations ofthe Minister  of Labour and are  accordingly mac is  torecomis.hu the Cabinet to assent to any proposal for reducing the minimum  age for unemployment insurance to 14.13.   The Committee have also examined the following proposals which were  not submitted to the juvenile unemployment-Committee,EXPERLMESTALAEBA3GEMEMTSFOE PRACTICALTRAIiJIHG 03?YOUTHS IS AHIN3KFT*afl0HALFACTORY.14.   . The suggestion has been made that, in one  ortwo-large tows,  for instance in London-and Manchester,buildings which have recently been used as GovernmentInstructional Factories for the training of disabled  ,ex-service mm might be utilised for giving to  anumber of unemployed youths end particularly tothose between the ages of 18 and 20 more practicaltraining than can be provided in juvenile unemploymentCentres.
IS        &apos;    &apos;&quot;&apos;, &apos;.\                         ?!     ;15.   The present proposal would  be either(a)   to give  the youths a training, at the end of      which they might hope, if they obtained a      suitable kit of tools, to earn some kind of      living on their own account or on jobbing work;      or(b)   to give  them a shorter course which, would make      it easier for them, if &quot;they could obtain the      entry to a woodworking shop of one of the      skilled  trades (joinery, furniture, or vehicle      building) to become after further shop experience      fully Bkilled workmen.     For the former .purpose, nothing less  than 12 months would be of value; for the latter purpose 6 months wouldbe  the minimum period that would  be useful.&apos;16.  Attendance at such a factory wo-besquilles be made a con-.dltion of the  payment of unemployment benefit and. itwould, be necessary to give the manager, of the factorypower to make  deductions from the unemployment benefit for offences against discipline,  non-attendance and loss.of  or damage to tools.17.  The establishment of a system of training for othersthan disabled  ex-servise mon would represent an entirely new departure  which presents rather alarming possibili-ties in the way of expenditure, but apart from this theCommittee feel that the difficxilties of placing men whentrained and of disposing of the product of government factories which have constituted  such serious&apos; obstacles to  the successful carrying on of  .the scheme for trainingdisabled ex-service men would arise no less acutely inthis case.   In the&apos; &apos;         -         . -8-   -   -     :
UNEMPLOYEDAPP HGMICES.circumstances the Committee feel unable to recommend the Cabinet to approve the experimental arrangements proposed, but they would suggest that the Ministerof Labour should pursue enquiries with representativesof Employers and Employed.18.    The Committee have also considered a suggestionthat Local Employment Committees or Insurance officers should be given power to require apprentices toskilled trades unemployed owing to absence of workto attend at technical schools as a condition of thereceipt of unemployment benefit.19.    The object in view would be not to continuethe apprentices practical shop training but to keepalive their  interest in their trade and to improveduring the most receptive period of their lives their knowledge of the more theoretical side of their work.In many technical schools the apprentices oould inaddition get a small amount of practical work.20.  :  The cost under the scheme would be the paymentof technical school fees, which fees would probably not exceed on the average 15/- per head per session.21.    The Committee recommend the Cabinet -           to approve the proposal that local           Employment Committees or Insurance           Officers should be empowered to require           apprentices to skilled trades unemployed           .owing to absence of work to attend where          , possible at technical schools as a condition          j of the receipt of unemployment benefit and           that the Minister of Labour should be           authorised in such cases to pay the           technical school fees of the apprentices           in question.
 $  1J EDUOATIOBAL  SUGGESTIONS.ALLOWANCES*HW  PLACESAT SECOIJUABYSCHOOLS. .22,  Two further suggestions have been submitted tothe Conmittee Toy the President of the Board of  18Education for assisting in the reduction of thenumber of unemployed juveniles, viz:-     (A)  The removal of the present limit on          the expenditure of Local Education          Authorities recognisable for grant          en maintenance allowances to children          receiving advanced instruction in          -Central or other Elementary Schools.     (b)  The increase in the number of free          places at secondary schools.23*  Maintenance.Allowances are at present onlyrecognised for grant up to 31st. March 1925 in  cases in whioh the  child is above the age limit foraompulsory attendance and within  the total ansuntpaid by each  local authority in 1921-22, theaggregate expenditure for the country being about 25,OOO.  The Committ ee att ach great.importanceto the&apos;maintenance of the rule that such allowances are not to be paid to children still liable to compulsory attendance, whatever the age.limit may become, but subject to this they  recommend:-.          That, as regards maintenance allowances  &quot;... ....-&apos;- at.Elementary Schools,  the restrictions          to the, period to 31st March 1925 and to          the figures of expenditure&apos; of 1921-22    . 1  &quot;  -: should now be waived.    The concession.is estimated to lead to anadditional 1,000&apos; children being entered in thesoschools in 1924-25 at a cost to the exchequer of about  5,000. ;24.  The number of free places at Secondary Schoolsincreased very rapidly during the period 1914-21and,- AS A result of the Geddes^Committee^ enquiry,                     -10-  &apos;&quot;&apos;:-:-&apos;-&apos;           -  -
                                                        r  ;   19               the&apos; proportion of such places to fee-paying places               was stereotyped in 1922 at the percentages then               Obtaining.  Owing tfl thb increase of fees the number               cf fee-paying soholars has fallen and this, under               the operation TF the percentage arrangement, haB               led TO a decrease of about 6,900 in the number of               free places sinoe 1921-22.  In these circumstances               the Committee recommend:-                          That the Board of Eduoatien should be                          authorised to administer, or if                          necessary modify, their regulations se                          as to allow of an increase of 2,500 in                          the total number of free places next                         . September and a similar increase in                          the following year  (1925-26). .                    The tctal will then still be within the figure for               1921-22.  The increased osst to the Exchequer would be               about  10,000 in 1924-25 end about  30,000 in the               foil owing year.
