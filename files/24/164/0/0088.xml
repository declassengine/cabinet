The  time  allowed  by the  Post  Office (London)Railway Act, 1913, for the completion of the railwayauthorised thereunder was five years from the passingof that Act, but the interruption of work caused by thewar rendered the  completion of  the work within thattime impracticable.    The time for  the completion of the work has fromtime to  time been extended by orders made under theSpecial Acts (Extension of Time) Act, 1915, as extended by the War Emergency  Laws (Continuance) Act, 1920.Under the last of these orders the time for the com-pletion of the work has been extended to the 15th August1924.    The powers under the Act of  1915  having expired,no further extension of time under that Act is practicable.Further  legislation is therefore  necessary.  This  Billproposes  to  allow an additional three  years for thecompletion of the work.48-2
