[This Document is the Property of His  Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.     February 1924.SECRET.CP. 63(24).  -  I circulate  below two private telegrams (which appear to have crossed) on thesubject  of  Gandhi&apos;s release, together with  a further  official telegram  from tbeGovernment of India.     385.   Private and personal.   With reference to your telegram of tbe 2nd,February-and preceding messages as to release of Gandhi, the Cabinet to-day considered thesemessages and understood that tbe Government of Bombay had been in communicationwith Gandhi with a view to  bis release, conditionally on his giving  an undertakingon medical grounds that he  will abstain from any political activities.   This coursewould be consistent with the general desire of the Cabinet, to whom the release of gandhi would  be agreeable.  But the Cabinet wished to leave full discretion to you to act as you considered best  in the matter.     Private and personal.  You will have received our official telegram regarding our decision about gandhis release.  We had to take an immediate decision, as otherwise resolution  would have come  on to-morrow.  I regret that  there  was not time to consult you further.   On the  whole I  should  have preferred  to have stood to our original intentions,  but in view  of Bombay  Governments  telegram we acceded to  unconditional release.  Bombay  opinion  was  practically unanimous, except in European circles, where it appears to have been divided.  What weighed with me and the English members of my Council was that, inevitably the agitation would continue, and that the Bombay  Government, notwithstanding their statement that they would carry out the detention, would constantly bring further pressure to  bear on us which would prove irresistible.  As .1. felt that  we should be bound to give  way, it was wiser to do  so immediately  rather than to refuse&apos;to-morrow and then later be obliged to announce a revised decision.   Undoubtedly there is the risk of  recrudescence of agitation by Gandhi, but it is  better to accept this risk in view of the Governor of Bombay&apos;s  attitude, rather than immediately present risk of  agitation  in Bombay which would in the end result in release. From Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India, ith February 1924.     Eollowing is in  continuation  of our telegram of 2nd February;  Gandhi.   We have received reply from the  Government of  Bombay, dated 3rd  February, urging immediate unconditional release, the full  text of which follows.   Following is our reply, which embodies bur decision ; ,   &quot; Your telegram  of  the  3rd February, No. S.D. 155.  Gandhi.

     As none of the only possible alternatives now open possess decisive advantageswe Lave  considered  it necessary to accept the conclusions of the Government of bombay, which is primarily concerned.    i Following is text of Government of Bombay&apos;s reply, referred  to  in Part I. yourtelegram of the 2nd February.   Gandhi.     (1)  Difference between views expressed in our  telegram of 1st  February fromthose previously expressed is due.to  fuller  analysis of  the situation,  and the. balanceof advantages and disadvantages to  be expected from Gandhi&apos;s continued  imprison-in en t.  This Government has had Jurther  opportunity of discovering the  strength ofopinion among Indians of  all classes and  shades  of  politics.  They discovered thatresponsible European opinion was by no  means unanimous.-  This Government didnot propose to treat the present industrial situation infBom&apos;bay as a determining factor in deciding an  issue of all-India importance.  They  presumed that  Government ofIndia,would agree that decision whether he should be imprisoned further, in view ofpersistent and widespread demands for his release, must be made on a general balanceof political advantages and risks..     (2)  The risks of release may be deducted from  his past record, combined with thefact that he has indicated in his interview with Mr. Sastri, just before his operation,that his political theories have in the  past, although possibly without his volition,resulted in bloodshed  and disorder.   They may possibly do so again.   Gandhi  may,if released,&apos; assume  that  peace which has prevailed since his imprisonment is  an indication that the,country is  now ripe for civil disobedience, and may inaugurate a movement which may again result in disorder.  These are very grave  risks, and this government has no desire to minimise them ; on the other hand, it does not considerit wise to exaggerate them.  Such action on Uandhi&apos;s pait will, as in past, lead to arevulsion of feeling  against him.   This  Government does not  believe that Gandhi,though a danger to peace, can be regarded as a serious menace to British rule in India.     (;-&apos;)  In  favour of his  release is the universality of the demand.   This may  bebased on adventitious circumstance of his  illness, but its universality  is in. itselfstrong reason forgiving in to  it. Moderates and Liberals have, in their past loyalty to the Constitution, a claim to be heard in the  counsels of  the Government.  their demands may be  illogical, but they have  committed  themselves,  and  to  drive them into opposition would be bad politics, unless their demand is so obviously unwise thatit must be flouted.  Further, it. is doubtful whether, in view of his past record andthe  distrust which it has aroused in thinking minds. Gandhi  can induce public tofollow him in anything likely to produce disorder.     (4)  Positive results which  maybe expected from release are: (1) A.n access ofpopularity  to  Government likely to facilitate ordinary work of  maintaining law andorder ; (2)  check likely to be exercised  over the Ali Brothers, who have recently been tending more and more  to a violent propaganda;  it might also serve as a: check on anarchical  and violent movements  which are a  possibility in  Bengal and  Poona; (3)  substitution of opponents  who  will be open and above board for men who are notoriously unscrupulous.     -.(5) It is further possible that Gandhi&apos;s first action on release may  be to denounce Swarajists  for their defection  from pure principles  of non-co-operation,  and thus considerably reduce  their power for harm in Legislatures.1   On the other hand, it is almost certain that refusal of demand  for his release will drive over  Moderates and- Liberals to  the Swarajists&apos;  camp, and so-precipitate a constitutional crisis,  which might work itself out in disorder  as bad as anything to be anticipated from Gandhi&apos;s release.  Governor-in-council  has  grave  doubts  whether further  imprisonment of Gandhi will produce benefits sufficient to outweigh disadvantages of giving opponents of Government  an opportunity of  wrecking  reforms.  Disregard  of  the  opinion of Liberals and Independents would  probably result  in voting down of  all  Budget demands and rejection,of  all-Government  measures, raise aiserious political situation, particularly in the transferred departments, endanger  reforms by indicating incom- competence for any  measure.of responsible Government.   Bombay Government, which  is pledged to  the  utmost -endeavours  to  promote -success of reforms, cannot view this with  equanimity.  Moderate Party,  including JVIahomedan group, are  only hope here of practical  success.   Release  of Gandhi, on their representation, would  give them new lease of life and opportunity to  save reforms.      (6). An additional element of danger is the present mill  strike in Bombay.  There are one and  a half lakhs of men.at present on  strike with no immediate prospect of return to work.   They will form an inflammable material for agitators  to work on, and
the riots and bloodshed which might ensue., were  advantage taken by the agitators;of a refusal  to release Gandhi, is a matter of  sufficient consequence to be taken intoaccount in  deciding even an all-India issue.  This Government lis prepared, if it bedecided that continued imprisonment of Gandhi  is necessary, to  put down any suchdisorder, but it submits that  disorders such  as  these must be weighed,  against anydisorders which may be feared from his release.     (7) Governor in Council is of opinion that the case for and against continuedimprisonment is very evenly balanced, but on full consideration is of opinion that themost advantageous course  will be release, unless the Government of  India are sure that such an intermediate course, as is proposed in your para. 2, would be accepted byLegislative AssembJyand thepublic asa sufficient compliance with demand for immediate and uncond itional release.   Governor in Council thinks this unlikely, for the agitation isnot directed against the place of bis internment, but against his detention at all.   But ifthe Government of India decide not to release him and are prepared for the politicalrisks involved,  then this Government,  while maintaining its view in favour of release,wrould arrange for Gandhi&apos;s detention for the rest of bis term in  some  place  otherthan  prison.  If  so, they agree that  this  intention should be at  once&apos; announced.He sees no  advantage in, and  very little likelihood  of  obtaining, any such statement by Gandhi as suggested in your telegram.  Wherever detained,  so long as be is a prisoner,  Gandhi will  observe, as he  always has observed,  rules laid down  for prisoners, but he will not bargain with  the Government for  concessions wdien  he iswell enough to undergo imprisonment.  Tbe undertaking referred to in our telegramof tbe 28th  January only  referred  to period  of  bis convalescence, when restraintsmight have to  be relaxed.   As a sick man, he can accept the privilege as a right, but when well  he  would probably demand to  be sent back to Yeravda so as not to be inenjoyment of privileges denied to any  other political  prisoners,  and  support bisdemand by hunger-strike or some such method.  This Government regards his returnto Yeravda&apos;to be  impossible in any circumstances.     (8) If, on  the other hand, Government of  India concur with  this Government in finding balance of advantages is in favour of release, this Government, is of  opinionthat release should be announced as immediate and  unconditional.  Otherwise, much-of the political advantage  which may be hoped for from it  will be lost.  It is very likely that  Gandhi&apos;s health and his own  private inclination will  keep  him  out of-active politics  for six  months  or more.   He  will be  assisted  in this by tbe  strictinjunctions of  his present medical advisers, and  will  probably exploit his  own&quot;weakness to the full.
