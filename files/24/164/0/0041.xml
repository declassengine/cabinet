ISEORET.I.P.  41  (24).CABINET.BRITISH DYESTUFFS CORPORATION,Memorandum by tho President cf the Board of Trade,     I am circulating to my colleagues a report prepared inmy department on the present&apos;position of the Dyes question and of the negotiations between the British dyestuffs corporation and the German dye makers.      The salient facts are as follows5-     (l)  After the outbreak of War the British Governmentpromoted the manufacture of dyes in this country, becauseusers in this country had been almost entirely dependentupon Germany for the supply of dyestuffs before the War, and because it was felt that the maintenance on an adequate scale of the synthetic manufacture of dyestuffs in this country-was a matter of national importance,  As a result of the steps taken, the British Dyestuffs Corporation was eventuallyformed with a capital cf about  9,000;000, of which theBritish Government held  1*700*000 equally divided betweenpreference and ordinary shares.     (2) As it was feared and expected that after the Warthe Germans would make, every effort to recover the british market and that the newly established British industry wouldthen be unable to maintain Itself against the competition of the long established German industry (which becasie a powerful combination before the close of the War), aCommittee was appointed by the First Coalition Governmentin 1916 to consider the whole matter.  This committee recommended that the importation of foreign dyestuffs, except under licence, should be prohibited for a term of years afterthe War.  Effect was given to this recommendation by theIffTS DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANK!0 MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.
passage of the Dyestuffs (import Regulation) Aot at the end of1920.  The licences to import provided for under the Aot aregiven on the recommendation of a Committee on which theusers are largely represented.                            238     (3)  It goes without saying, that, however perfectly suchan Aot might be administered, it must result in a number ofmore or less serious inconveniences, and it has thereforelong been the prevailing opinion among the leading users thatit would be of considerable advantage if British dyers oouldenter into an agreement with the German producers so that therestrictiveness of the DyestufCTs Aot obuld be very largelyrelaxed.  The producers have also been anxious to enter into some arrangement with the German producers, with the object ofsharing in the accumulated experience of the German makers and thereby increasing the efficiency of British production.Consequently negotiations with the Germans were entered intoabout two years ago with the cognisance of the BritishGovernment and of some representative users.  The conduct ofthese negotiations appears to have been a matter of greatdifficulty and they were broken  off, but, after being resumed,the  heads of an agreement between the German combination andthe  British company were drawn up in  November last and approved  by the German combination.      (4)  The substance of the agreement made, which was tohold for  50 years, was that  the  German dye makers should placeall  their patents, information,  knowledge and experience atthe  disposal of the British  Dyestuffs Corporationj that theGerman makers should oease to compete in the United kingdom but  continue to supply such  dyestuffs as were required andnot  produced here, through the British Dyestuffs Corporation;;&apos;and  that  business  in the British Empire should be divided inagreed quotas.  As regards finance, the British Dye-stuffsCorporation was to keep the  first  200,000 of their profits for years and the first  150,000 of their profits thereafter,all  profit over these sums to be equally divided between the
British company and the German combination.  1          299     (5) In the opinion of the British producers the quantityof output assigned to them under this agreement is adequate,but some leading users who have been consulted raise certainobjections, the chief of which was that the agreementinvolved a grave interference with their access to Germansouroes of supply for a long period of years.  The users&apos;difficulties have been discussed at joint meetings of theBritish produoers and three or four leading users.  Thediscussions are still in progress and there is some chance that agreement may be reached.  It appears to be the general opinion that if the British industry is not protected fullyunder the Dyestuffs Aot, or by means of some suoh agreement,it is in real danger of collapsing.     In all the circumstances&apos; it would seem that the government need not raise any objection to the agreement between theBritish Dyestuffs Corporation and the German combination (whichwould involve at least a considerable relaxation of therestrictions imposed by the Dyestuffs Act) provided thatproducers and users can come to agreement on the terms of thearrangement with the German producers, and I suggest therefore that the matter should be left for the timo being where it is,I understand that it Is a matter of importance that the termsof the proposed arrangement with Germany should not for thepresent be disclosed as otherwise the negotiations would be prejudiced.S.WcW 0? TRADE,31/1/24.
      In 1914 the textile and other Important dye-using trades ofthe United Kingdom were almost entirely dependent for their supply of dyestuffs upon Germany,   The difficulties experiencedhy those, industries, together with the realisation of the greatimportance of the manufacture of synthetic dyestuffs as anational industry-;, caused successive governments to give greatattention to efforts to develop the industry in this country.The most important steps taken in this direction were:-      (i) The formation In 1915 of the company which ultimately          developed into the British Dyestuffs Corporation,Ltdj and     (ii) The enactment in 1920 of the Dyestuffs (Import Regulation)          Act.      British Dyestuffs Corporation Ltd., is the outcome of the amalgamation of two concerns ^ (i) British Dyes Ltd,, whichwas formed in 1915 with Government financial assistance;  and(ii) Levinstein Ltd,,, a company which had been carrying on thomanufacture of dyes on a limited scale before the war butexpanded rapidly during the war,   The amalgamation was broughtabout in 1919 mainly in consequence of strong representations made to the Board of Trade by the colour-using industries tothe effect that in view of the limited amount of scientific andtechnical knowledge available the separate existence and unco-ordinated activities of these two companies was resultirTg inoverlapping and dispersion of effort which was wasteful andretarding the development of the industry, and that effective co-operation ,between the two conoerns could only be broughtabout by a merger.   The original scheme of British Dyes Ltd, wasthat the ordinary capital of the company should be provided by negotiations BETWEEN THE BRITISH DYESTUFFS CORPORATION            AND THE INTERESSEN GEMEINSCHAFT,
dye users  so as  to create  in effect a prodttcing co-operativecompany of dye  consumers who would he less interested in theprofits earned  hy the  company than In the security of their supplies  of dyestuffs, and the Government had undertaken toassist by  advancing money  on debenture in certain proportionsto the ordinary capital so subscribed,   But when the BritishDyestuffs  Corporation  was  formed it became necessary to issue a large amount  of new  capital which was subscribed mainly bynon-consumers;  and,  further, in view of representations to the effect that whilst  the Government were urging theestablishment of the industry in the national interests it was,itself, taking  no part of  the risk, the Government interest  wasconverted  from  debentures  into shares and extended so as tocomprise the full amount which the Government had undertaken to advance to the  original company.   The Government accordinglytook 850,000 preference shares of  1 each and 850,000.preferredordinary shares  of  1  each.   At the present time the paid upcapital of the  British Dyestuffs Corporation is  9,197,101made up as follows:-    Preference  shares   4,117,117  of which the Government holds                                    850,000,    Preferred ordinary shares  4,085,794 of which the Government                                   holds  850,000,    Deferred ordinary  shares   994,190      The  Articles of  Association of the British dyestuffs corporation provided (a) for the appointment of two GovernmentDirectors  (who  are at  present Lord Ashfield and Sir HenryBirchenough) with certain  powers of veto; (b) for enabling tho Boarof Trade to prevent shares in the company being held directly                                                          *or indirectly by foreigners; and (c) for issuing to the nomineesof the Government a preference share conferring upon the holdersvotes sufficient to enable them to prevent any alteration of the
                                                       9A9   Articles of Association,  The Articles of Association also   give the Government certain rights of intervention which tend   to secure that the prices charged by the company shall be   reasonable and that the distribution of Its products shall   be equitable as between the various classes of consumers0(3)       It was early recognised that the German dye-making   companies (who had been co-operating to some extent before   August 1914 but early  in the war had become very cloeely   associated in the Interessen-Gemeinschaft) would make every   effort to recover their hold on the United Kingdom market   after the war, and that, in view  of the very large scale of   their production, their great financial resources, their   great technical and commercial experience, and the goodwill   which they had established, some  measure of protection  for the   nascent British Industry would be essential.   Consequently   the  matter was fully  considered by a Committee of the First-   Coalition Government  in 1916, whioh recommended that the    Importation  of foreign dyestuffs  except under licence should   be prohibited for a terra of years after the war.   This   policy was recommended on two grounds, the first being  that   for  the reasons given above no moderate Customs Tariff would   be an effective protection, and the second that a licensing   system would allow  of competition from abroad if the prices    charged by British manufacturers  were unduly high-  The policy   thus laid down was approved by subsequent governments and was   publicly announced;   and effect was finally given.to it by the   Dyestuffs  (Import Regulation) Act, which was passed in   December  1920 and became operative on the 15th January, 1921,                             -6-
    That Act prohibited the importation into the UnitedKingdom of all synthetic organic dyestuffs, colours andcolouring matters and all organic intermediate products used IJSthe manufacture thereof, but the Board of Trade were given power to authorise the importation either generally or in anyparticular case of any of the goods so prohibited, and it was provided that in respect of licensing the Board should be advised by a Committee consisting of five representatives ofthe dye users, three of the dye makers and three independentpersons of whom one should be chairman (the present chairmanis Sir Thomas Robinson, M.P.),   Informal undertakings weregiven that the Committee should have as free a hand as possiblein establishing and administering the licensing policy, and asa matter of fact there has been no occasion during the threeyears In which the Act has been in operation on which theBoard have overruled a decision of the Committee.     The general principle laid down by the Committee fromthe outset was that import licences should not be granted inrespect of dyestuffs which are either manufactured in theUnited Kingdom or for which satisfactory equivalents are somanufactured, and that the onus of showing this to be the case should rest on the dyestuff manufacturers.   The Committeehave the services of a whole-time technical expert appointedby the dye makers and practically the whole-time services ofa similar expert appointed by the dye users;  these twoconsider all applications for lioences and if they agree asto the grant or refusal of a licence the appropriate action is taken immediately;  if they disagree the case cdJaes upfor detailed consideration by the whole Committee.   Where a licence Is refused applicants are informed as to the Britishdyestuff which is considered to be equivalent and the name ofthe maker.   Gradually, with the aid of a Joint AdvisoryCommittee of other experts nominated by the dye makers anddye users, two lists have been compiled, the first consisting
                                                     \   :30iof dyestuffs as to which, the Committee are satisfied thatthere is production adequate in quantity and quality in theUnited Kingdom, and the second that dyestuffs known to berequired by the users and not produced in the United Kingdom,Both lists are amended from time to time.   Applicationsrelating to dyestuffs in the first list are automaticallyrefused;  applications relating to dyestuffs in the secondlist are automatically granted;  the consumers whoseapplications are refused have opportunity of bringing beforethe Committee any special circumstances which they thinkshould be taken into account - these circumstances may bethat the dyestuff recommended is not suitable for theparticular purpose of the applicant or that the price of theBritish dye in comparison with that of the correspondingforeign dyestuff is so high as to hamper trade.     The result of these arrangements is that licenceapplications are now dealt with reasonable expedition.   Forexample, in December 1923, 460 applications were received and 20 were outstanding at the end cf the previous month;of the total of 488, 381 were granted, 71 were referred tothe British makers, 19 were referred to Reparation dyes and17 were outstanding at the end of the month;  of the totalof 488, 427 or 87$ were dealt with within 10 days and thegreat bulk of these within 7 days.     For the whole of the year 1923 applications for licences to import amounted to 5S012,47S lbs.   Licences were granted in respect of 3,691,440 lbs. and of these 1,412,115 lbs. were from Germany, 1,817,571 lbs. from Switzerland and 461,253 lbs.from other souroes.     It should be added that during the year some 1,300 tonsof dyestuffs were obtained from Germany by way of reparationin kind (part of this, however, being for the India market).In respect of reparation in kind the Board are advised asto the requisitions to be made by a Joint Committee of colour
                                                            V t)users and colour manufacturers whose recommendations are -reviewed by the Licensing Committee,     The main difficulty in the administration of the Act hasbeen in respect of applications to import based on the lower prices of foreign dyestuffs.   It was felt that in view of  thegreat importance of our export trade in dyed and printedtextiles the possibility that foreign dye-users might be ableto get their dyestuffs at much lower prices than the British,users must be given very careful consideration;  on the otherhand the depreciation of the German mark, added to theadvantages derived by the German makers from their vastlygreater output and long manufacturing experience enabled theGerman makers to offer dyes at prices with which Britishmakers could not possibly compete and the effect of allowingall applications based on price differences would have beendisastrous to the British industry.   The difficulty of deter-mining whether any user was placed in an unduly disadvantageouposition vis-a-vis his foreign competitor, by being prevented from obtaining the cheap Geraian dyes, was very great but afterlong discussions with the two interests concerned an agreement was reached in the middle of 1922 whereby it was laid down that the lower price of a German than of a correspondingBritish dyestuff would not be a grima facie reason for thegrant of a licence to import unless the British price was more than three times the pre-war price of the dyestuff inquestion.   A Joint Advisory Committee of colour users andcolour makers advise in any particular case as to what thepre-war price was;  If the British makers&apos; price is morethan -three times that figure he is given 48 hours in which  todetermine whether he will or will not take the order at three&apos;times the pre-war price;  if he refuses, a licence to Importis granted immediately.     The dye-making industry in this country has made sub-stantlal progress.   There are about 20 firms engaged solelyor mainly in the manufacture of intermediate products anddyestuffs in this country but the great bulk of the production
is in the hands of four concerns and the British dyestuffs corporation represents at present something over 60$ of thetotal production.   The number of workpeople employed in theindustry at present is about 5,500o   It may be pointed outthat since the Act earns into operation and largely because ofthe Act one works in this country, whioh is entirely owned bya combination of Swiss dyestuffs makers, has been vary largelyextended and its range of production has been muoh inareased0The total capacity of all .works is probably about twice thepre-war United Kingdom consumption so that there should ultimate-ly be a substantial export trade,   Before the war seme BOfo ofour requirements of dyestuffs was met from Continental sourcessbut the British makers of the remaining &amp;of1 were largely dependent on foreign supplies of intermediates0   The consumptionof dyestuffs in this country is at present muoh less than beforethe war owing to the prolonged depression in the textile trades,but as regards the present consumption the pre-war position, hasbeen reversed and British makers supply about 4/5tb.s0   the proportions vary aoeording to the class of dyestuffs; in someclasses practically the whole trade is now in the hands of Britishmakers whilst in some of the more difficult classes the Britishproduced proportion is still aomparatively small.   Practicallythe whole of the dyestuffs made in this country are from homeproduoed intermediateSo     Whilst the quality of the British-made dyes is not yet entirely satisfactory  there has been great and steady improve- ment, and  it  has been  stated  on behalf of one of the largest combines engaged  in the  dyeing of  textile goods  on commission that less  than l/5th of  their consumption  is  supplied from foreign sources and that they are  able to give as  full  guaran- tees in respect of quality as they gave before  the  war.      The main criticism directed against  the  British makers
relates to price.    Though for the past two years there has-been a steady reduction in price and many dyestuffs are soldat prices  much below the three times factor mentioned above,it is admitted that the general level of prices is higher thanit-should  be  partly because of the restricted scale of output(which is  largely a consequence of the depressed condition  ofthe textile trades) and partly because of the inexperience  ofthe British makers as compared with their German competitors,with the consequence that their manufacturing yields are capableof great improvement.     Ever since the Treaty of Peace it has been urged by the colour Users  that the most hopeful line of progress was anarrangement with the German Dyestuff Manufacturers wherebytheir knowledge and experience could be made available to theBritish Industry on some terms compatible with the generalpolicy which  His Majesty&apos;s Government had in view.  It was thought that  this would obviate the expenditure of much timeand energy on researches (both in laboratories and works) toacquire information and experience already possessed by theGermans, with the result that the German Industry would always  .maintain its  lead.   This view has been adopted by successive governments and during the past two years there have beennegotiations from time to time be We en the British dyestuffs corporation and the German Interessen-Gemeinschaft, with theknowledge and approval of successive Chancellors of the Exchequerand Presidents of the Board of Trade and of the last two PrimeMinisters, and also with the knowledge of the German Government.These negotiations have been a matter of great difficulty, butin November last the Heads of an Agreement between the two&apos;Companies were settled at a meeting in London; they were subsequently approved by the governing body of the Interessen-Cemeinschaft and the detailed arrangements to give effect tothe Heads of Agreement are now being worked out.
     The Agreement will  then be  submitted  for  approval  so  far  as     necessary  to the Shareholders  in  the  Corporation,  and as  the     Government is a very large  Shareholder  (to  the  extent of     approximately one-fifth) its approval is  essential.    The late     President of tho Board of Trade had expressed to the  Directors  of     the Corporation his general approval  of the scheme, but apart     from  the Governments interest as  a Shareholder, there are     certain broad considerations to be takon  into account.(7)        The substance of the Agreement,  which  is to hold for 50     years, is  that the German Dye  Makers  will place at the disposal     of the British Dyestuffs Corporation  all  their  patents,     information, knowledge-and  experience;   the German Makers will     cease to compete in the United Kingdom  but  will supply suoh     dyestuffs as are required in the United Kingdom and not pro-     duced here, such supply being  through the British  Dyestuffs     Corporation, which will become the Agent  of the German Dye     Makers;  business for parts of the British  Empire  and China     is to be divided in agreed  quotas.    The  British Dyestuffs     Corporation estimate that this will give  them twice their     present output, so  that their  production  should be about     15,000 tons, and 0 this enlarged  output  and the advice of     German experts will result  in  lower costs of production and     improved quality.   The British Dyestuffs Corporation are to     retain the first  200,000 of the  profit for 5.years,     and  thereafter the  first  150,000  of  profit;  profits  above     these figures are to be divided equally between the British     Dyestuffs  Corporation and the  German  Makers *0 (a)     The Agreement  is criticised  by such  representatives  of     the  British Users as have been consulted  privately mainly     on the ground that  it deprives them for the whole     period of  the Agreement and not  simply  for  the  comparatively     short period of  tho Dyestuffs  Act, sf free  access  to  the     German Makers;   that such competition as  there  Is  at  present     between  the Corporation and the Germans in  respect of
SOD    either price or quality will thereby disappear;  and  that    they will be dependent upon the British Dyestuffs  Corporation    for knowledge of and access to new dyestuffs produced  in    Germany.   Negotiations are at present proceeding  between    the British Dyestuffs Corporation and. representative dye    users which it is hoped will result in arrangements  which    will largely mitigate and perhaps entirely  remove  this    particular objection,(b)       A second and more general objection which has been    raised is that the Agreement puts a definite check on  the    expansion of the British Industry,  (in so far:as it  is    identified with the British Dyestuffs Corporation),    inasmuch as it limits its market to the United Kingdom    and a portion of the trade of the rest of the world  and    consequently the purpose pursued by successive Governments    since 1915 - the establishment of a strong, progressive  and    independent British Industry  - will be defeated.  On the     other hand it is contended that  the Agreement  offers the     Corpcration the best chance  of development  on  sound  lines   :    that  it has yet had, and whilst  it may net  expand  so     rapidly as it might do  if  it  could  rely  on  unmitigated    protection the Agreement will  secure  to  this  country an     industry  on a substantial  scale  and capable cf rapid     development in  an  emergency.   The fact that the  Government    has a  large interest in  the  Corporation  and is represented     on the  Beard  of Directors  will afford  a  guarantee  that     the national  objects will  not be lost  from  sight.         A  third  objection, which  is likely  to  be  raised by     the other British  Makers  of Dyestuffs,  is that the     competitive power  of the  British Dyestuffs  Corporation     against them will  be  so  greatly  increased by the     Agreement that  it  will  be  practically  impossible for them     to maintain  themseIvor,  and  that the  efforts which they                            -13-
have made with Government encouragement will be renderedfruitless.  In regard to this it must be pointed out thatone Company which is specialising, on classes of --difficult.dyes for which the demand is small though very important(Scottish Dyes Limited) is closely associated with dye-using Companies, and for that and other reasons is not likely to be adversely affected; that the British AlizarineCompany, which also specialises in a particular class ofdye of which the consumption here and in India isconsiderable is likely to enter into a  separate arrangement with the  Interessen-Gemeinschaft (negotiations as to this are proceeding) - It had an arrangement -with its Germancompetitors before 1914; and that most  of the  other companies  (other than the Swiss owned concern) are very  smalland  are unlikely in any event to be able to maintain them-selves except in so far as they are engaged on the manufactureof  specialities  for particular classes  of consumers.     It has long been recognised that the British dyestuffs corporation is  over capitalised, largely because buildings and  plant were  erected at a  time when costs were extremelyhigh, and the Directors have for a  long time past hadschemes of financial reconstruction under consideration.The  Germans have made  it a condition  of the Agreement  thatthe  capital of  the Corporation shall  be reduced from its    &quot;present level to something under  6,000,000.   The  late President of  the Board of Trade, after  consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Neville Chamberlain), informed  the Directors of the  Corporation in November  last that the  Government would be willing  for their shares *in the Corporation to  be written down pari passu   with the shares of the  other  Shareholders.   The proposals  submitted by  the Directors in  December  last  to  the  Board of  Trade and communicated  to the  Treasury went, however, further than this and  invited the  Government  to make a concession larger than that which it was proposed  to ask  the  other  Shareholders
      to make.(10)        On  reviewing all  the  circumstances  it would  appear      that  provided  agreement  can be  reached between  the      Colour Users and  the  British  Dyestuffs Corporation  on      the questions  raised  in  paragraph 8 (a)  above the      Agreement  is one  to ?/hich  the Government need not      object.(11)        AS  regards the proposed  financial reconstruction      this  is  primarily a matter for the Treasury,  but      it  is thought  that the Government might  properly      agree to its  shares being written down pari  passu      with  those of  other Shareholders but should  not make      any special concession;  and it is understood that      this  would not be a serious obstacle to  a reconstruction      which would bring the capital of the Company within      the limits which  the  Directors have in view.Board of  Trade.
