7051    100  2.24    [This  Document is  the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]                    (Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1924.)SECRET.CP. 55(24).     I circulated with my CP. 46 (24)^ draft of a reply to the Government of India&apos;telegram of the 28th January,  on certain pending resolutions in the Indian LegislativeAssembly.  The following is the final form in which the reply has been approved bythe Prime Minister and sent.                                                          SYDNEY OLIVIER.  4th February 1924. Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Home Department, 2nd February-1924.     381.  Your telegram  of  28th January.   Rangachariars resolutions.   I agreewith your views as expressed  in para.  8 that  both parts  of  the first resolution mustbe opposed.     With reference to para. 9,1 do not think it desirable to volunteer a presumption that changes in His Majesty&apos;s  Government may be  looked  to as  opportunities forpressing changes in fundamental  policy as  to  constitution of Government  of India,which it has been established convention to regard as continuous and unaffected  by.party politics.  The present-form of  the  constitution  is based on the  policy  ofParliament declared  in the preamble  to the Government of India Act, 1919, namely,that it is to be regarded as a stage in the development of self-governing institutionswith a view to the  progressive realisation of  responsible Government in British india as an integral part of the Empire.   This is  uncompromisingly the  policy  of His&apos;Majesty&apos;s  present  Government, as it  has  been that of their predecessors in officesince the Act  was  framed.  This  intermediate  form of  constitution was neces-sarily in  some degree  tentative  and  experimental and  is  liable to be  modifiedwithin  the provisions of the Act.  Before, however, I can concede either  that suchextensions of the reforms as are contemplated in the second resolution may be regardedas calling for  consideration, whether  by  a Commttee of. the Indian Legislature  orotherwise, I should wish to know what definite  complaints are made  and admitted  by your Government of inconveniences in the working of the Act, regarding it as a provisionfor efficiently carrying on the government -of the country during a transition  period.Whilst His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot admit, and have not received any sufficientground  for presuming, that the  considerations which in  1919 were held to demandprovision for a transitional  constitution  have been substantially modified,&apos; they wouldbe surprised to find that the precise form of constitution framed bad given absolutesatisfaction in its working in all details.  They are, therefore, entirelyjOperi to consider any clearly formulated statement of the precise  points in  which the present form of constitution is felt  to work injuriously to the efficient carrying on of government, in sofar as these points  are not merely formulations of a general impatience with a partialor transitional reform, or of a determination to make such form of constitution unwork-able in  the hope of  coercing  His Majesty&apos;s Government into the grant of a form of constitution which four years ago they were convinced,  after the  fullest  and mostliberally intentioned enquiry, would be more unworkable still.   I agree with your viewthat even  if a Parliamentary Commission were to be appointed before 1929, which theAct does not appear to me to  prohibit,  but for which at present no convincing casehas  been  shown to  us, it  could probably not establish any facts which you and thelocal Governments were not prepared to state and advise upon, and also that the time has not yet arrived and that the constitution has  not yet been sufficiently tested bythe   experience  so  far attained  of the  working of the Councils.  Moreover, usefulexperience cannot  possibly be obtained  unless the  Councils are worked by- all parties in good faith and with goodwill  as a  means,  as above stated, of carrying  on thegovernment of the  country as efficiently  as possible during a transition stage and withan entire  willingness to accept  any modification within the Act which  majT be  agreedto be likely to facilitate  such efficient working.   I am,  therefore, entirely willing  togive you  discretion now to consult local Governments as to the possibility of furtheradvances under the Act, or to obtain material for a judgment  as to defects or possiblereforms based on practical argument as distinct from, general ideas  of- policy in anyother manner  which you may think suitable  and desirable.  If such examination should lead you to consider  that  there  may be a case for considering  the question ofan earlier appointment of  a Parliamentary Commission, 1 can certainly not &quot;take theresponsibility oE saying that this course would not, be adopted.  If  there is  anything in this telegram the intention of which is not perfectly clear to you, you may be ableto communicate with me  again on the subject in time for  me  to reply before the debate.
