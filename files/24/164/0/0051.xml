ii1 e X13  TDQU1.1BHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIIAHJ3I0 MAJESTY&apos;3 SOVEHMMBNT)f!..P,50 (24) .OAS I I E I.TRADE  HOILI. TIES  BILL.MEMORAHDTM BY TEE LORD PBESIDEHT.      The  circulation of a draft of a  Trade Facilities Bill seems to  offer a suitable opportunity for considering a ratter closer definition than has hitherto obtained of the conditions under vifoich &quot;the Treasury  may......0 guarantee In  such manner and form and on such terms and conditions as  they think proper the payment of the interest and principal of the loan  or of either interest  or  principal&quot; contemplated under g I (1) of the original Act  of  1921.&apos;The present  3111 continues the operation  of  the Acts  of 1921 and  1922 for  a further period, and increases  the total amount of the money available under the Acts.      When applicants for assistance under the Aots are proposing to  carry  out a  capital undertaking for the manufacture or production  of ^oods in an  already established industry by means of  a well-understood process or processes, the  considerations to  which  the Advisory  Committee nominated by the Treasury must have regard are  confined to:-           (a)   the financial stability of the promoters                of  the  undertaking  in  question,  and           (b) the  probability that&apos; a  reasonably remunerative              market will  be  forthcoming  for the goods to              be produced. But the Department of  Scientific and  Industrial Research has recently been  consulted by the Advisory  Committee  as  to proposals which  involve  the  establishment of a  new industry by means  of processes  which have not  as yet  proved economicallyt
remunerative.  Two cases have come to the  notice  ofmy Department of applications to the Advisory Committeefor assistance in establishing undertakings  for the lowtemperature carbonisation of raw coal, and it is under-stood that further applications of the same  kind mayhe made in the near future.   Tho Department  has animportant Fuel Research Station at East Greenwich opened in 1919, and is expending annually about   40,000  ofpublic funds in the examination of this and  allied problems     Cases of this kind introduce completely new considera-tions.  They may serve for the temporary mitigation ofexisting unemployment while the necessary  plant is undererection and under&apos;subsequent operation,  but if the processproves to be a failure tho men employed will again be without work, and oven though tho Government may not becalled upon for its guarantee, the -money found by thepublic on the strength of the Government support  willprobably be lost, while public faith in tho  value of aGovernment guarantee will be shaken.  On the other hand,if new processes can be successfully launched and new industries established through tho operation of the Acts,a new channel of employment will be provided &quot;withpermanently beneficial effects for tho workers.     The introduction of new processes, and still more,  ofnew industries, however sound the preliminary scientificwork may have been, always requires highly trainedtechnical knowledge and criticism throughout the early stages if success is to be achieved, and if  applications-of this kind are to be considered and financial supportprovided, it is of the gr* a test importance that theAdvisory Committee should, have the support of all theinformation in the possession of tho Government before a
decision is reached.  In the case of low temperaturecarbonisation, which involves the national interests ofhealth, economical use of wasting resources,  and defence,it Is equally important that the Government,  In returnfor assistance given to the introduction of  new  and information of the working of tho processes.   It  is  as important for the Government to know the cause of failure,should that result, as to know the reasons  for success.     it is not essential to provide that this  method ofprocedure in the cases under review should  be  madestatutory by insertion of definite provisions  in  thepresent Bill, if it Is understood that  the Treasury interpretits powers under para. I (1) of the  Act of 19,31  in  sucha way that:-(a)   the Advisory Committee  should be directed to     consult  the Department  of  Scientific and     Industrial Research  on  the technical aspects     of any application under the Acts involving     the introduction  of  new or only partially     tried processes of manufacture;(b)   it should be a condition of any guarantee by     the Treasury under the  Acts to any undertaking     involving the introduction of new or only     partially tried processes  of manufacture, that     during the erection  of  the plant and (within     the period of the guarantee) during its     working,  the representatives of the Department     should have free  access to the works and to     the relevant records; and(c)   full data be lodged  with the Department of the     working, of the process  during such period as     the Department may determine but not exceeding     the period of the guarantee.experimental processesj  should have  full and systematic(Signed)PA3UD0R.etmary 2nd.,  1924.
