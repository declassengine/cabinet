THE MINISTER OP LABOUR,  I QCP. 36(24)                                            -  13                             RAILWAY DI3PTO3.                  2^&apos;)1.     My oolleagues will be aware  that  a  settlement betweenthe Hallway Companies and the Socomotive Enginemen&apos;a and firemen&apos;s Union has been reached.   Comments have  been madeby the  rasa and by others on the fact that the Minister oflabour, the responsible Minister, did not  appear  to have been active in forwarding the settlement of this dispute.  It wasthe view of the Cabinet on Wednesday last  that it  was batterto allow the Traaes Union General Council  to oontlnue to bethe mediating body,  I was constantly in touch with Mr. Bramleyand at his express desire I re-affirmed  this view and agreed with him that if there was a proposal to adopt a  policy of intervention he would first be consulted.  He expressed very strongly the Opinion that the Government should keep out ofit.  I agreed with Mr. Bramley that It was right  to allowhim to continue his efforts.  I was in constant touch withhim throughout the week-end and it was present to  the minds of Mr. Bramltyy and his oolleagues on the Mediating Committeethat if at any stage It appeared that action by theGovernment would be profitable, I was at his disposal.2.     Credit is due to the Mediating Committee for thespersistency with which they conducted the negotiations and for the success with whioh those efforts were  event^al^ycrowned.
