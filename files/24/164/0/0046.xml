DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                         CABINET.                   UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE;*5-liili.    MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  MINISTER-  OF  LABOUR.      1,   The points whioh call for immediate aotion in connection      with Unemployment Insurance ares-           (l)  The restriction on the grant of uncovenanted benefit      to oertain classes of applicants,  particularly single men and      women residing with relatives.           (2)  The &quot;gap&quot; of three weekB after twelve weeks of      uncovenanted benefit have been drawn.      2.   The first of these points can be dealt with by      administrative aotion.  I propose  to abolish these      restrictions so far as they make the grant or refusal of      uncovenanted benefit depend on the private resources of the      applioant.   This will mean that the classes  at present      affected, namely, single men and women, married women, short-      time workers and aliens with less  than 10 years&apos; residence,      will be dealt with on preoisoly the same lines as other      applicants.   The mere fact that they may have some      private resouroes of their own or  from relatives  will not      be a ground for refusing benefit.    At the same time I      propose to pay strict attention to the requirement which,      among others, is laid down by the  Act that uncovenanted      benefit is not to be given to a person who Is not &quot;genuinely      seeking whole-time employment and  unable to obtain it&quot;.      My colleagues will appreciate that while it is important not      to refuse benefit in any proper case,  It is equally      important that the administration of benefit  should not be      allowed to fall into disrepute owing to benefit being paid      to persons who are not really doing their utmost  to secure      work,9 9d ii
     It is not easy to estimate the financial effect of abolishing these restrictions but, as nearly as oan be judged,the effeot will be to Increase the amount paid In benefit out,of the Unemployment Fund in the period up to October next by asum which is not likely to be less than  2,000,000 and maybe as much as  4,000,000 or even more.3.   The gap of three weeks Is imposed by statute.  legislation is neoessary, therefore, In order to remove it.  AS the gap hasalready begun to operate and will go on operating as long as thelaw remains unohanged, it is essential that the law shouldbe altered without delay.   I would propose, therefore, tointroduce a short one-olause Bill for this purpose as soon asthe House meets,  and I should hope that this Bill oould beoarrled almost without discussion and without difficulty.   Ifthe gap is abolished an additional sum of about  600,000 willbe paid in benefit out of the unemployment fund In the period up to Ootober next.4,,   There are a number of other points in oonneotion with unemployment lnsuranoe whioh will need attention duringtho next twlve^e&amp;tha^ In particular the grant of benefitduring tho year ending Ootober,  1924,  is limited by statuteto 26 weeks.   This limit oannot begin to operate at earliestuntil the middle  of April so we  shall have a little time inwhioh to take stook of the position before legislation Isneoeesary,   what I would propose, therefore, is that thispoint together with others on which I expect to put forward proposals should be dealt with in a second and more oomprehensivBill to be lntroduoed as soon as the Government have completed their consideration of the position.   In any statement thatmay be made to the House regarding the first Bill I should propose to tell the House frankly that the second and  largerBUI is In course of preparation and will shortly be introduced.
     5. There ia, of oouree, a disadvantage in havingtwo Bills dealing with the same subject in tho same Session,but owing to the need for abolishing the gap without delay and the undaslrability of ooming to hasty decisions on theother Important points that have to be considered, I think the plan I have outlined is on the wholo the right one.     6. The Treasury who have been consulted, agree to theproposal to abolish the gap of three weeks, but as regardsthe restrictions on uncovenanted benefit they propose, Iunderstand, to submit thoir views in a separate memorandum,                               -   (Intld.) T.S.Mini etry of Labour.1st February, 1954.
