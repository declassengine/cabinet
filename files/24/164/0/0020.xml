ADMIRALTY VIEWS OH THl^PEOPOS^^SAIF^OF^BE GOVHRMBNT T8              HOLDING II fBB AHGLO-PKRWFOIL COMPANY.            M.1M0RAIDUM BY IBS FIRST  LORD OF THE&apos; ADMIRALTY,           The  Admiralty have  given  their  careful  considerationto  the  Haval aspects  of the scheme  for  the  sale of theGovernment holding  in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and themerging of the latter in a Royal Dutoh  -  Shell -  Burmah Group.           It should he borne  in mind  that the Governmentholding waa acquired  solely to put  the  provision  of the oil fuel requirements of  the Fleet on a satisfactory  footing ^to  obtain, as  was said at the time, &quot;the  certainty of being able to buy a  steady  supply of oil  at a steady price.&quot;  Butfor the need of obtaining this security,  the question ofinvesting  public money in an  oil company  would never have arisen. Reference  to the parliamentary Paper published atthe time (cd.7419 of  1914 &quot;Agreement with the Anglo-persian oil Company Limited&quot;)  mates this perfectly  clear.         It is only right, therefore, that the rulingconsideration  in deciding whether the Government  holding should now be  given up should be the effect of such a step on theAdmiraltyTs position  in regard to the supply of the Fleetrsrequirements,,           The  main  grounds upon which Parliament  was asked to,sanction,  and  did sanction, the Government Agreement with theAnglo-Persian  Oil Company were the  following:-    (l)   .  That it would place the Admiralty in a  position           to draw a large nucleus of the  Haval requirements           from a source which was independent of  ForeignTrusts, under Government control,  and  well-situated                                            from....
                   from a strategical point of             12Q          view,   (8)    That by securing the maintenance of at least          one largo British Oil Company, having independent          control and considerable supplies, in close          relations with tho Government, it would &quot;have         &quot;an effect not merely on the supplies directly         &quot;so obtained, but on the terms and Conditions on         &quot;which the whole of the Admiralty^ requirements         &quot;will bo met, owing to the greater independence         &quot;and bargaining power thus obtained&quot;.(3d,7419 of         &quot;1914],          Both of these anticipated conditions have been fully realised.  We get 40$ of the fleet&apos;s annual requirements onexaeptionaily favourable financial terms under direct contract-with the Anglo-Persian Company, whioh lasts as long as theirconcession.  As regards the remaining 60$, which we buyfrom the open market, we are placed, as we have frequentlyfound, in an extraordinarily strong position for bargaining.          It is true that as these advantages.result directly -from the Anglo-Persian Agreement they would be lost if thePersian, supply were to fail for any reason.  The possibilityof a sudden failure of the Persian fields, such as hasoccurred in Mexico, has figured largely in all that has been said and written in-support of the Merger Scheme.  It-hasbeen suggested that the Admiralty are running a. serious riskin  rolying on a single oil field., (although the phrase&quot;single oil field&quot; is- scarcely., applicable to the. Persianconoession).. - It has been hinted that there is a geologicalsimilarity between.the Mexican and Persian fields thatmakes it reasonable to. apprehend a sudden failure of thelatter.                                            The,.,.
         She length of any oil fieldTs life depends upon fewofactors; firstly, how much oil there is in it, and secondly,how fast the oil is taken out of it.  On the former pointwe can hare no exact information, therefore no actualassurance that an oil field will last for a definite periodof years is practicable,  We can only go on a basis ofprobabilities,          The fact that the new Group is ready to pay e verylarge sum in order to get control of the Persian fields initself,suggests that the apprehensions as to the reliability of the fields are not very deep seated.  And apart from this,all the enquiries that I have made, and particularly theopinion of Sir John Oadmau, who is probably the hostauthority we could consult, go to negative the likelihood of  -a collapse of the Persian fields during tho life of thoconcession (now about 37 years), provided always that their development continues to bo on the conservative lines followedby the Anglo-Persian Company.          This proviso, however, brings into prominence thesecond factor governing the life of an oil field,  So longas the Government, through its holding in the Anglo-Persian.&apos;Company, remains the principal owner of the concession, wehave full knowledge, and also control, in regard to the rate at which the fields are depleted.  The whole organisation ofthe Company contemplates production, on an increasing scale,it is true, but on a scale that appears to us to involve no danger of the fields becoming exhausted during the term of  the concession.  And the Government, through its representation on the Board of Directors, is in a position to know and3 if need beB to control tho policy of the  Company in this respoct.,          $hat would be the position if the proposed&apos; schemeof merger comes in to effect?          She central feature of the proposed scheme  from the                                                         point.
point of view of the Admiralty is the proposal that the newgroup shall assume the responsibility for executing theexisting Admiralty supply contract, and in addition shall make a further agreement with us, securing the quantity whichwe are entitled to draw under the existing eontraot upon thewhole of the resources of the Group - but not at the existingcontract price,  In other words9 the offer is that if, duringthe currency of the existing concession and contract, thePersian oil fields should cease to produce the whole quantitywhich we are entitled to draw from that source9 the new group will mate up the deficiency from its other fields^  But anyquantity so supplied to compensate for the Persian deficiencywill not be at the Persian price but at market price6          The Admiralty have considered this proposal oare^fully8 on the basis, which I believe to be reasonable, thatthere is no real probability of a sudden eollapse of thePersian fields whilst their development proceeds on the presentconservative lines.          It is clear that the result would be- that the group would obtain control of these fields as a new source of supply for their world-wide business.  Also, the limited duration of the concession, the cheap cost of production, the much wider basis of the Group as compared with the Anglo-PersianCompany, and their much more extensive distributing organisat-ion, point almost certainly to a policy of greatly increased production of oil from Persia, as being in the Interests ofthe Groupo  it must also be recognised that the Governmentwould retain no control over the GroupJs policy in thisrespect, and therefore the possibility of the fields not lastingout the full term of the concession would be increased, andmight become a real danger.

In other words, the offer is that if, duringthe currency of the existing concession and contract, thePersian oil fields should cease to produce the whole quantitywhich we are entitled to draw from that source9 the new group will make up the deficiency from its other fields,.  But anyquantity so supplied to compensate for the Persian deficiencywill not be at the Persian price but at market price0          The Admiralty have considered this proposal sare^fullys on the basis, which I believe to be reasonable, thatthere is no real probability of a sudcfen eollapse of thePersian fields whilst their development proceeds on the presentconservative linese          It is clear that the result would be- that the group would obtain control of these fields as a new source of supply for their world-wide busineSB0  Also, the limited duration of the concession, the cheap cost of production, the much wider basis of the Group as compared with the Anglo-PersianCompany, and their much more extensive distributing organisat-ion, point almost certainly to a policy of greatly increased production of oil from Persia, as being in the interests ofthe Group,  It must also be recognised that the Governmentwould retain no control over the Grouprs policy in this   *respect, and therefore the possibility of the fields not lastingout the full terra of the concession would be Increased, andmight become a real danger.                                                      It 0 o . a
f Op- . ht lj           It is tixo that the Group offer, in! place of the Government&quot;:s existing aontrol, a bon poro dei famille clause  troviding that &quot;the concern shall be exploited to its full&quot;economic -capacity and generally in accordance with the&quot;principles of sound development of a field held under a&quot;concession Laving a certain number of years to run0n  I think it is obvious, howevers that each a clause is no adequate safeguard, as it&apos; would be practically impossible to prove, after the event.&apos; that the exhaustion of the fields ought to have been avoided.  lor in any case would money damages&apos; really compensate for the premature loss of the Persian supply.           The Admiralty have endeavoured to ascertain whether as against this diminished security of the Persian supply, the Navy will obtain, under the Group1a offer, any new source of supply of oil of the Naval quality, as prolific and as well-placed as the Persian fieldsa  So far as we know, however, the only sources of supply of oil conforming to Admiralty spoc-ifieation which the Group would &quot;bring &quot;into the pool&quot; raider the Merger Scheme, in addition to the Persian source, would be Borneo and Sarawak,,  The former is a Butch source, in regard to which the Butch!Navy is to retain a preferential position, and both aro less favourably situated than Persia as sources of supply of our Fleet,,           Further, as regards utilisation of these sources of supply in place of Persia, the proposal is only that we shall be guaranteed the quantity at a market pride&apos;,      *&apos;           XI was pointed out to tho representatives of the Group that.this gives to the Admiralty no power that we have not got already,,  If tho Persian fields were to fail tomorrow
we should he able to go into the market and buy our requirements at a market price.  The Group then stated that by market price it is intended to Indicate the price currentbefore the hardening of price that would normally occur intho event of a failure of the Persian supply.  The Admiraltyare of opinion that it would be impossible, in practice,to turn this vague formula into an effective safeguard against excessive prices, particularly in the situation thatwould exist when the new Group and the Standard Oil company were practically in control of the worldTs supply of oil.          Tho general effect of the GroupTs proposal, there**fore, is entirely unsatisfactory from the Naval point of view.On the one hand, the future of the Persian fields and theAdmiralty Supply Contract is, if not jeopardised, at leastput out of our control.  On the other hand, no advantagesnot already possessed are conferred in respect of other sources of supply.          Passing now to the second ground on which parliament was asked to sanction the existing arrangements with the Anglo-Persian Company, ica, the greaterindependence and bargaining power thereby obtained in meetingthe portion (now about 6Cf) of the annual Naval requirementsnot covered by the actual supply contract, the Admiralty aresatisfied that under the scheme of merger this advantage would be wholly lost   The  merger would give to the newGroup a practical monopoly of the Eastern oil fuel supply.In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that the Group, to-gether with the Standard Oil Company, would practically con&quot;trol the oil fuel supply of the whole world.         There oan be no question, in the opinion of theAdmiralty, that the result would be a substantial increase                                                    3.lT a o * a
in the prices of oil fuel products generally,,  The Admiraltyare not dealing hero with the question whether it isadvisable to involve the public in a material and probablylasting increase of prices.  Considering Naval requirementsonly, however, it is their decided view that it is notadvisable to agree to a scheme which would deprive theAdmiralty of the valuable safeguard at present possessedagainst unduly high prices in respect of 60f of the Navaloil fuel supplies.  It may be pointed out that it would bewell within the power of the now Group gradually to recover from the Government whatever price they might have paid forthe government&apos;s holding, in the form of higher prices charged for tho remainder of tho Naval requirements over  *a period of years.          In the opinion of the Admiralty the only way inwhfch the scheme of merger could be carried through without serious prejudice to the present Admiralty position, wouldbe if it were made subject to the condition that the wholeof the Naval annual requirements (instead of 40$, as atpresent) should bo secured under contract at a fixed pricecThis would mean that the new Group, as a condition of thesale of tho Governments holding, would be required toenter into a new agreement to supply up to a million tonsa year at, say, 30/- a*ton, in addition to executing theexisting Anglo-Persian contract for 500,000 tons at 30/-a ton, loss rebate which has at times brought the price aslow aa 20/- a ton,          When interviewing the representatives of the Group,I sounded them on the possibility of such an arrangement.I was informed, however, that in no circumstances would theGroup bind itself by a long-term contract to supply at a                                                    fixed....
          I have dealt in the foregoing with the Navalaspects of the question only.  Naturally,  howevor,  the more general arguments both for and against the Merger have also .come under my notice-, and I should therefore like to add that,even apart from the paramount Naval considerations, theobjections to the scheme, in my opinion, outweigh thoadvantages.         The chief advantages claimed appear to bo:-   (l)   The elimination of wasteful competition between tho         Companies concerned,&quot;  Prom a profit-making point                                                        of.....fixed sum.  No doubt there ere strong reasons from acommercial point of view for this decision.  But the reasons why the Admiralty should not rest content with any lessmeasure of protection are. equally strong,  The difference ofopinion on this point seems to me to be decisive, and to showthat our interests and those of the Group are not in harmonyHiand cannot be harmoniseda          I do not propose to discuss in detail the other suggestions of the Group in regard to the Naval fuel supply.Most of them resolved themselves into offers to carry outservices or provide facilities at the cost of theGrown (either by deduction from the purchase prioe of the.shares or otherwise), which services and facilities theAdmiralty are satisfied that they can undertake more economically and efficiently themselves.  All the suggestions have been carefully probed; but there is not one of them towhich those responsible for the maintenance of the fuelsupply of the Navy can point as a valuable compensation forthe advantages which we should have to relinquish if thoscheme of merger were approved0
of view this is desirable,  but it would notnecessarily confer any benefit on the public orthe Government.                    ,The elimination of Government interests in atrading concern.This is desirable, in the absence of tho special(Naval)reasons to the contrary, which,however,exist today as in 1914*The withdrawal of Government support from a company that has been alleged to be mismanaged-and financially unsound.-  There is, in myopinion, no ground for affixing this character to the ingio-persian Company.  The Company ispassing through a difficult temporary phace, butthere is no reason to doubt its future.The placating of foreign, particularly UnitedStates, opinion. - Although the United Statesdislike tho Government interest in the Anglo-Persian Company, it&apos; is probable that there wouldbe even more complaint if,  by selling our shares,we assisted in the creation of a Group that wouldrival the Standard Oil Company in importance1.The merging of the Shell - Royal Dutch group ina British combination.- This is undoubtedlydesirable if it can bo effectively carried out,but it is very doubtful whether the present scheme has this result, except on paper0On the other hand, the following objections exist;The scheme is pressed upon us at a time when tileprices&apos;of all oil products, and tho shares of oil companies generally,, are lower than they have been for years.  However good a price is offered for                                            tho,..
          As is known to the Cabinet, many protests againstthe merger have been raised, e.g. on behalf of the labourParty, tho motorists of this country, and the AustralianCommonwealth Government (which has entered into certainrelations with the Anglo-Persian Company on the strength ofthe British Governments interest in it).  It has also beenbrought to my notice that the Anglo-Persian Company ishampered in its management, by the faot of having this possibility of virtual extinction oonstantly hanging over its head.  It is, therefore, in my opinion very desirable thatthe Government should decide definitely against the merger,and should let it be known that, so far as wc can make itfinal, this is a final decision.                                 (intd.) L. S. A.ID/1/24.       thc Government holding,  it would be difficult  to       meet the criticism that  we have sold at the worst       possible moment.(ii)    The carrying through of  the merger would,  it is       generally agreed,  be followed by a general rise of       prices of all oil  products, from oil fuel  to motor       spirit.   This would be resentod by tho  Public.(iii)   The future of the  Oil Refining and Shale Oil       businesses in this country are likely to be       seriously affected by the  merger.
