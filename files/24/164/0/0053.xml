THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET       CABINS T,NATIONAL  HKAIjTH&apos;  INSURANCE.Copy No.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.     li    I desire to obtain the directions of the Cabinet on aquestion concerning Medical Benefit under the National HealthInsurance Scheme.     2,    I have now received the report of the oourt of enquiry which was appointed by my predecessor and the late Secretary forScotland to determine the capitation fee to be paid to the panelpractitioners as from 1st January, 1924.   Their finding, whichia binding on the  Departments and on the representatives of the doctors for the.year 1924, is that the cepitation fee per insured person per annum shall be nine shillings and they.recommend thatthis fee should remain In force for a further period of threeyears after 31st December, 1924-.     3,   The total cost of medical benefit and ancillary servicescomprises not only the remuneration of the medical practitionersbased on the flat capitation fee for medical attendance and treat-ment but also the expense of drugs, the special mileage allowances to rural doctors,  the cost of the referee consultant service and thecost of the central index clearance bureau.   It is estimated thatthe cost of these latter Items for the year 1924 will amount to the equivalent o.f 2/9^ per insured person, which with the 9/- fee for medical practitioners, means that ll/9l per insured person must beprovided.  -     4.   The sum allotted for medical benefit as a whole underSection 7 of the Act of 1920 Is 9/6 a year for each Insured person and this amount is provided in the actuarial basis of \he scheme.The cost of medical benefit for the two years up to 31st December,1923, amounted to 12/- a year per insured person.  Until 31st March,1922, the excess cost of medical benefit over 9/6 was borne by specialExchequer Grant, but as from 1st April, 1922, the special Exchequer
-Grant., was..withdrawn for reasons o-f economy and-the -whole- cost was,under certain temporary- provisions in: an Act of 1922,. borne by ,  //insurance finds.,, into, which has been or will be paid the ordinaryExchequer Grant under the principal Act of 1911 of two-ninths ofthe total cost of benefits, .It should be mentioned that, in orderto avoid- an increase in the contributions, the approved societiesvoluntarily undertook to bear this extra charge.up to the31gt December, 1923, when the agreement.with the doctors, thencurrent, came to an end.     5.   The temporary provision in the Act of 1922 under whichthe excess cost of medical benefit over the amount provided bythe Act. of 1920 and in the aotuari&amp;l basis of the scheme was borne *by insurance funds came to an end on 31st December,  1923, and asfrom 1st January, 1924,. there is no statutory provision- for thecost.of  medical benefit beyond the 9/6 made available under the.Act of  1920..  As from that date, therefore, a sum  of 2/3^ perinsured  person (amounting&quot; approximately to  1,720,000 per annum for England and Wales and - Scotland) has to be found.  The money-will have to be provided  (1) by existing National  Health insurance funds or (2) by an increase in contributions, or  (3) by a Stategrant or by some combination of these alternatives.     6,   Medical benefit, is one- of the primary benefits underthe Insurance scheme and if the question, could be.dealt with on ordinary lines,. It would  appear proper  on financial  andadministrative grounds to charge, the whole cost to.insurance funds.  - Normally an increase of the cost of medical benefitto an amount in excess of the provision in the actuarial basisof the  Insurance scheme would raise the question of  anincrease in the contributions.  It would seem&apos;, however, to bedifficult, if not quite impracticable, to induce Parliament toraise the contributions of employers or insured people at a time ofindustrial depression and when the contributions for unemployment

Looking atthe position of societies covering the great.preponderance ofinsured persons, he is&apos; satisfied that an additional charge ofat least 1/5 a member (of which the Exchequer would find thestatutory proportion of two-ninths) could be made agiainst the funds  of.individual approved societies in respect of medical benefit.for the five years&quot;1924-28, without  impairing the ability of the  societies generally to maintain their presentadditional benefits and in many cases to pay increased additional benefits,  It will oe remembered that each approved society andbranch is a separate financial entity.and among so large anumber of societies there must be some.cases where the  conditionsabove  set out will not be found to exist,  in the opinion ofthe Government Actuary, however, these exceptions vvill.be very few and will Include an inconsiderable proportion of*theins or e d populati on,     B.   I am further advised that, in addition to the existing resources of the&apos; individual societies, further sums could bemade available  to  them out of the National Insurance Funds in      ...                                          England/
                                              -                                               4? V 1Wales  and Scotland held by the central Departments during thenext five years  (valuations are on a quinquennial basis) withoutin any way impairing the financial structure of the insurancescheme.     9.   All Health Insurance contributions are paid into theStamps Sold Accounts kept In the several National Insurance Fundsend out of those accounts credits are given to societies in respectof the contributions of their members.   There are, however, alwaysvery large balances in the Stamps Sold Accounts which cannot be credited to any  fund or account and no claims will ever ariseagainst part of  these balances, viz., the monies representing stampson cards which are never surrendered and the interest accumulationson the balances  of the account.   Under section 29 of the national insurance /set, 1918, provision was medo for determining from timeto time the amount of the balances in the Stamps.Sold Account onwhich no claim was likely to arise and for paying nine-tenths ofthe sums so determined into the Central Fund - a fund set up underthe Act of 1918 to enable the deficiencies of Societies disclosedat valuation to be made good, so far as they do not arise from anymaladministration on the part of societies.     10.  The amount of the available balances is, however, somuch larger than was expected that it is considered unnecessary totransfer to the Central Fund the whole of the sum available for transfer.   It is considered that a Central Fund amounting to 2,000,000 Is wholly sufficient to meet the purposes for which theFund was established by  law, and  it is estimated that if arrange-ments  be made to maintain  the Fund at that  figure, sufficient moneycould  be released from the unclaimed balances to provide approxi-mately a  sum which, with the State two-ninths added, would, yieldlid.  per member for each year  during  the next five years.   If,therefore,  the necessary  legislation  could  be obtained  to  providefor this  adjustment, these  additional resources, together with theadditional charge  of l/5  a member which  (see  para. 7 above) couldbe provided  out of  the  funds  of  individual  societies, would enable the
                                                 0 0 si&apos; whole cost of medical benefit to be found by insurance funds duringtbe next five years.     11,  Accordingly on the strict financial merits of  thematter as thus explained, there seems to be no room for  doubt  that additional contributions cannot be justified, and It has alreadybeen pointed out  that such contributions would be difficult, ifnot quite impracticable, in present conditions.     12.  If It ie found practicable to place the whole  costof medical benefit on tho National Insurance Funds in  the pro-portions above indicated, the result would be that of  the  1,720,000per annum required over and above what  is secured by the Act of1920 (SQQ paragraph 5 above), approximately  830,000 would be  borneby the surplus resources,of societies,   510,000  by the existingbalances in the hands of the Departments, and the remainder, 380,000 by the Exchequer as the normal two-ninths grant.     13.  The Cabinet will be aware, however, of the very strong feeling on the part of approved societies throughout the country that no part of the cost of medical benefit beyond the amountof 9/6 provided by the Act of 1920 and  by the actuarial  basis  ofthe scheme should be charged to their funds.    It  is understoodthat attempts were made during the recent Election to  obtainpledges from candidates to oppose  any legislation  imposingfurther charges and the societies  claim that  a  considerable body -of members of Parliament are so pledged (including myself andother Ministers).  The  facts set  out in this memorandum as tothe financial position  of the funds were not, however, withinthe knowledge of  those who gave the pledges,  or  (for the mostpart) within the  knowledge of those who asked  for  the  pledges, though they  are  of  course within  the knowledge  of .the  lateMinister  of Health.    It is  a question  for  consideration bymyself  and my colleagues how  far  pledges given  in  such circumstances would  be  and  ought  to be  maintained  in the face  of
                                                 909                                                 0 U e) itha full&quot; Financial Report bringing out the facts above stated a0 to the roal position of insurance funds which would.normally be laid before Parliament with the new Bill.   My colleagues will realise that this question may give rise to a most  difficult political situation,  and accordingly I bring.it before them for full and early  consideration in the light.of all the circumstances affecting it.     14.   A large section of the approved societies have Indicated that they may press strongly for the revival of specialExchequer Grants for the whole or part of the excess monoy required over and above what is provided by the Act of 1930.  Any such proposal might,  however, well aroueo considoratle opposition in the House.  The  new Bill must be accompanied by a financial report which cannot but show the abounding prosperity of the funds of the societies and would be used in support of the contention that the Increased charges could be paid from the funds  without affecting either the maintenance of the present additional benefits for the great preponderance of insured people, or,  in many cases, the prospect that increased additional benefits will be possible. In these circumstances it seems very questionable whether Parliament would consider that the Exchequer can reasonably be called on to find, in whole or even in part, large additional sums (amounting to about  1,340,000 a year) not for new services but for the further strengthening of funds which are already in an unassailably strong position.  This  will be more especially doubtful if it ia necessary for us to make additional demands for considerable public expenditure in other directions, e.g. housing.     15.   It should be remembered that attached to tho Ministry of Health and the Scottish Board of Health there are ConsultativeI Councils for giving advice and assistance to Ministers on questions Elating to National Health Insurance.  In g^ptombor last.the views of these Councils were sought as to the capitation fee which
co-Jltf be  offered to &quot;the doctors vltbout detriment to the interestsof the insured population,  and they were advised by the government actuary that  Insurance funds could reasonably be called on to bear the extra charge of i/$  per insured person per annum already mentioned.    At first  viost  of the me-bsrs of the  Council were willligto agree  that at all events the greater part of this extra chargecould be  borne by societies,but subsequently,(doubtless primarily in the hope that a dlsp!s*-  of resistance would stiffen the Governmentin the negotiations then being carried on with the doctors),opposition developed and the asjorlty of the members of the  EnglishCouncil ranged themselves on the side of the societies, who contended that not  more than the amount provided by the Act of 1920 and by theactuarial basis of the system should be charged upon the funds ofsocieties for medical  benefit. Now that the capitation fee Issettled the views of the Councils would normally be sought beforethe necessary legislation was decided upon, but,having regard toell the circu.*i3tances  and. the fact that a demand for specialExchequer assistance Is llkel&quot; to be made, I heve thourht ttadvisable to  obtain the directions of the Cabinet before the consultative   Councils are  again called together,     16.    I  should be disposed to sum up the situation as follows. The arguments against charging the whole cost to the Exchequerare so strong that I cannot imagine such a course being considered at all, apart from the Election pledges glv-im in good faith but without knowledge of the real facts.  The objeot to be attained Isto Introduce  an agreed  Bill, as between the Government and the approved  societies.  The argu :ent In favour of placing the bulk,Ifnot the whole, of the charge on the societies rests on the financialposition which is inperfectlv known, if known at all, to  ;any ofthe;n,   On the basis of such knowlAd-e of it as the-.&quot; had, the consultative   Councils were ready to agree that at all events aconsiderable  share of  the  extra chare coul-1 be borne by the
                                                 3o f,J societies.   I suggest that the proper course Is that I, with the Secretary for Scotland and Ministers specially  conversant with this question, should be authorised at once to get into touch with representatives of the societies and make the hardest bargain we can with them, being authorised to make  it clear that there is no binding obligation on Ministers or members to honour Election pledges obtained from them in complete ignorance of the relevant financial facts.   There are, I am advised, precedents which could be referred  to at a pinch in support of such a position.     17*  A further/question which arises in this connection IB the duration of any new  contract which may be made  with the doctors.   I understand  that the approved societies, being dissatisfied with the award of the court of enquiry, press for a contract for one year only.   Under a one year contract which would run from the let of January laBt, the position will be that before the Bill is through Parliament, the Ministry will have to begin again the process  of bargaining which after months of time, produced the recent award*   The doctors jri.ll certainly in no circumstances accept a less fee without another arbitration, and it is useless for the societies to expect to obtain a lower fee from any arbitral body -the recent court gave them a very full and fair hearing.   And  on a year&apos;s contract another Bill next year will be required.   Every argument points to the necessity of a contract for, say,  four years, as recommended  by the reoent court, and such a contract would probably come to an end just about the time when the  then Government has received and haC time to consider the report of the Royal Coiumission on the whole system of National Health Insurance promised by the late Govern- reassessment , a promise which I  should propose to honour by setting up the Royal Commission during  the present year?   I  submit, there- fore, that a  contract for four years be made an integral part of toe  suggested negotiations with the societies.nistry  of Health.         :               (Intldo) J.V/.
