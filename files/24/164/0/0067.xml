Ig tk6.PR0B5RTY OF HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERUMEHT,             CABINET.JPI1BLIC HEALTH  (SCOTLAND)  AIIEHI&amp;C3MT  BIL^.Ig^QRANDM BY THS SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.          I circulate fcr the information of my colleagues draft of a Bill amending the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897, empowering local Authorities to provide insulin and treatment to persons suffering from diabetes who need assistanoe in obtaining the drug.          Local Authorities in Sootland have no suoh power, their ptwers being limited to infectious, epidemic or sndemic diseases.          As my oolleagues are no doubt aware, insulin is a most potent drug in the treatment of diabetes, persons suffering frum it being able, in consequence of the use of the drug, to live ordinary useful lives instead of remaining useless invalids.   It is, however, not required in the vast majority of oases which yield to treatment by diet.   It is required only in the severe case.   It is a most expensive drug and as it has to be administered^ several times per day during a long period, if not the remainder of life, its continuance involves a financial burden which oan only be borne by the&apos; wealthy.   It is estimated that the cost per week will be between 20/- and 30/- per person.          Certain olasses of patients are already provided for out of public funds -     (a)  Insured persons under the National Insurance Acts:     (b)  Paupors under Poor Law Medioal Relief:     (c)  Nursing mothers and their infants,  and children            under Maternity Service and Child Welfare            Schemes.          Other diabetics - principally the dependants of insured persons and those with small incomes - cannot afford. the treatment,          Looal Authorities will  doubtless expect  a Treasury Grant in aid of their expenditure ani I as taking up that matter  with the Treasury.          If the Bill is approved,  it would facilitate administration were I in a position to tell Looa\authorities that the Government intend to press for the Bill  so that pending its pas saga they may be  providing the drug inantioipatiok of statutory powers.The/
The Bill may be applied to diseases other than diabetes on an order by the Scottish Board of Health which is confirmed by Parliament.
