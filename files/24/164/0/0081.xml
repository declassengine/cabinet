1)88              (Hsmo Affairs Committee),           West Indira i(Tslfigraph) &quot;BUI.(Memorandum by. the Financial Secretary  to  the Treasury).           The situation as regards telegranhic communications in the West Indies has been explained in the Memorandum by tho-Secretary of State fc-r the Colonies relating to the pacific cable Bill.   The Bill circulated herewith.for the introductionof which authority is requested,  is to enable the Treasury toprovide the necessary capital for the manufacture and laying&apos;of the proposed cables and for the necessary wireless nlant.Generally the clauses follow the lines of the Pacific GableAct, 1901, which provided for the construction of the pacific cable, but there is;  of course,  no clause corresponding -to-Sec tion 6 of the Act of 1901 which constituted the pacific cable Board.           QIjAUgB. 1,  of the Bill authorises the treasury to piovide a sum not exceeding  400,000 for this purpose.Of this sum it is estimated that  267,000 will be requiredfor the manufacture and laying of the cables, and not morethan  b0,000 for the cost of the wireless plant.    another 13,000 has been allowed for contingencies,  such as office accommodation, and the remaining  40,000 is to enable theTreasury to provide working capital.   It is too soon yet  tosay how much of the  40.000 will be needed for working capital.           GLAUS ;Ji IT, of the Bill provides that the money required may be borrowed and that in that event the rates tfinterest shall-be aot more than 5 per? o-onfc,  and that thecapital shall be repaid by terminable annuities not exceeding30 years.   The inixntion is that the money shall be found
found by tftfe National Bebt Commissioners and the exact ratewill depend upon the terms on which they find it possible to -lend.           CLAUSE! Ill of the Bill pi ovides that the annualexpenses, including interest and sinking-fund on the capitalborrowed shall be charged against the rovenues of the system,and so far as these are insufficient shall in the first placebe met out of meneys provided by Parliament.   It is contemplate-ted that any deficiency shall be shared by the Government ofthe United Kingdom, the Government of Canada, and tbe Governmentof Trinidad, British Guiana, Barbados, Leeward Islands, Grenada,St.Lucia and 3t.Vincent, in the proportions mentioned in theschedule of the Bill.   The proportion of the annual deficiencyultimately to be borne by the Government cf the United kingdom will thus be bO/S63rds, the remaining l&amp;3/263rds of the deficiency&quot;being recovered from the other Governments concerned,           OffHTSjii.IV of the Bill provides that arfy profitsshall be applied, firstly,  to repaying the capital,  and secondly, to the Governments concerned,  in tbe proportionsnoted in the schedule of the Bill-,           CIilJS:^.fo- of the Bill deals with payments,  accounts and audit, and needs no explanation.TBjMMW &apos;                                &apos;   W.G.7th February 1924.
