3 E G RET.cabinet copy Mo85 (84)HOUSING I(Memorandum by the Chancellor of tbo, Exohequer).          Prom the point of view of direct charge on theExchequer, the Housing scheme is estimated ultimately to cost  26 millions per annum for two generations (in additionto tho  10 millions per annum for 60 years now being paid under tho Addison scheme and the cost of the Chamberlainscheme )This figure is hoary enough in itself, but it isobvious that it is likely to bo greatly exceeded,   In thofirst placo, it is quite clear that the subsidy would have tobo paid on houses costing more than  500 if the urban districtsare to be dealt with.   In the second place, the cost ofbuilding would obviously greatly increase under the proposed scheme, as it did in the oaso cf the, Addison scheme, whereit ran up to  1,000 or moro a house.   Would it bo possiblein suoh circumstances to maintain tho limit of  11 for the*                                                Exchequer
Exchequer contribution, leaving the rates to. bear therest?     Further, the&apos; estimate is calculated on thebasis of interest at 5fot and for a scheme of this size interest rates would certainly be considerably more.   If the interest rate was &amp;fo) without allowing for tho charge being calculated owing to increased coston a larger sum, the  26-millions -would-&apos;1te -something like  34 millions per armu&amp;.   finally, it is obviousthat there would he a growing and probably successfulpressure to limit the rents for the Addison houses, andin consequence the existing  10 million subsidy wouldalso increase.   The minimum estimate of the ultimatecost of the Minister of Health1s proposal would probablybe abeut  40 millions a year.          Even much more serious than the direct cost.to the Exchequer is the financial effect cf large loanexpenditure for housing- on the general national economy..If it is desired te mobilise the national credit, the firstnecessity is to make certain that you do net destroy it.Mow the amount of national credit available is notunlimited;  it depends cn the annual national savingand cannot ho increased except by that saving, unless one is to contemplate sheer inflation on a very large scale withall its oonsoquencos on prices and cost of living.   Out ofthe national saving all the capital investments of thecountry have to be financed, and housing is only one cf^those investments.
         There is no very reliable estimate of what theannual national saving at the present time is.   It isfrequently put at about  250 millions.   This figure is. Ithink on the low side but it certainly is not higher than. 400 millions.   Whatever the amount,  it has to be divided between     (l)  Industry,     (2)  Foreign and Dominion loans,     (0)  Loans by Local Authorities,  etc. in this country.,  and     (4)  In so far as the British Government raises new money,.              British Government loans *If the needg of Local Authorities are increased,  theyhave to attract money by paying a higher rate of interestthan ether people,  and that money has to come out of the share which the other claimanta might wish to have.           It must be remembered that the Governmentprogramme apart from housing requires capital for Telephones,for general Unemployment works, for small holdings, for TradePacilities.  for Irish Land purchase and other items such ascables.           If we now assume that housing alone,  being only oneof the needs of one of tho classes of claimants,  is to haveanything approaching  100 millions, it is obvious that tradeand the Dominions must go short (this,,  in fact,  happened inthe years Immediately after the war,  and is very probablyone of the main causes of the unemployment that followed).It
          It will, I assume, be admitted that tho funda-mental cure for unemployment lies in tho increase of our overseas trade.   from tho point of view of unemploymenttho building trade is not of first-rate importance.   If now we attempt to divert to building a large amount of thooapital normally reguired for trade and Dominion leans, weare in faot reducing the volume of our trade and expertsand intensifying the probabilities of prolonged unemployment&apos;!,          But tnat is not all.    Housing is only one of the many objects for which local Authorities have to hsrriw0Of the relatively small share of new capital^whiah can boallowed&apos;&apos;to local Authorities without damaging export trade by no means the wholo can go to new housing proposals.   Betonly is thoro the balance of the existing housing a sheas,about 76,000 houses or, say,  35 millions to be financed,hut the Local Authorities have all their other heeds,,   QJheyare being pressed and encouraged by Government Suhsidy to-incur large expenditure on roads and on all kinda of publicworks, tho total of which must run into  20 millions or 30 millions.   This  20 millions or  30- millions they haveto raise.   It is not too much to say that very heavy capital expenditure on housing will inevitably kill capitalexpenditure on unemployment, while at tho flame time iaoraas-ing the intensity of unemployment by diminishing exports.          That this is not merely a theoretical danger canbe seen from tho actual experience of Holland.   Hollandwhich had mado very largo sums of money out of tho war,embarked shortly after tho war on largo housing schemes                                               conducted.mm
 conducted through the municipalities,,   The strain of of financing theao schemes has been such that for tho first timo for many years Holland ha3 been unable to finance the capital expenditure of her own Colonies in the Dutch last Indieso   Tho Dutch East Indies have been forced for the first time in their history to borrow in  ondon and america,   Tho financial conditions in Holland aro extremo- ly bad and her bank rate is 5fa.          The British Dominions very badly need capitals If we cannot supply it to them they will have to get it from america with all the financial arid political consequences * Canada is already practically in the hands of American finance.  We may easily drive Australia on the same path.          But the trouble would not be confined even to those who wish to raise now capitals    There are also many persons, including the Dominions and the --British Government,who hava in the next few yoars to face very heavy renewals of existing debt.   If hoavy housing loans are beingfloated there is no doubt that tho resulting scramble forthe available new money will forco up money rates,  just asunder the comparatively humblo Addison soho mo tho normalrato for long-term loans roaohed 6$ or more.   If it were known that the Sooal Authorities proponed to raise   100millions a year for several years for housing, ratesmight easily go at least as high an 6$,  and the Govern-ment would have to pay that rato cn all its renewals *Theso renewals of maturing debt in the next 10 yearsamount to  3,500,000 (apart from Treasury Bills),                                              Ono
                    One of the great prospective economies is the          possibility of converting this amount, including the whole           2,000 millions of 5Jo War loan, on terms more favourable          to the taxpayer.   Any suoh pos.responsibility will be entirely          swept away by a successful housing scheme of the nature          adumbrated by tho Ministry of Health,  The Exchequer                                           far          would in fact not only have to pay/more heavily in interest          on its renewals, but it would also be at once involved,          by the depreciation of securities, in very heavy direct          charges which are now dormant for Bonds tendered in payment          of Death Duties and Depreciation  land ( 32 million per          annum).                    But even this is not all.   The effect on the          finance of the country at large might be more serious.          foreign holders of sterling are still extremely nervous and          doubtful if tho   can really be regarded as an investment          not likely to depreciate.   As soon as they heard of the          housing scheme they would at once see that it was likely to          be extremely expensive and to lead sooner or later to inflation-          tioa.   They would consequently continue accelerating their          flight to the dollar and the dollar exchange would go          against ug possibly with considerable rapidity.  We should          then have to pay far more heavily not only for our own debts          to America but what is far more important, for the wheat;,          tobacco, cotton, oopnor and other raw materials which it          is essential to us to import from AmeriGa if wo are to con-          tinue as a largo exporting country.   On this aspect t]go          announcement of the proposed schomo even if it proved          quite impracticable to oarry out  would havo almost as bad          effoots as its actual succosa.IggijugY, S.VJ,                                       P,3.  .7th February, 1984.
