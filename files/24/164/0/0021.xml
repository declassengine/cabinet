In consequence of representations made by the presidium ofthe Communist  International the National Congress of theCommunist party of  Great Britain,  which.vns to have been heldthis month,  has been postponed until April.     EKCmples  ere given of the efforts being mede by communiststo give effect to the  precept  that &quot;there is no more importsntend immediate  work  for the Party than work among trade unions.&quot;     The organised  unemployed  are  msking arrangements for edemonstration  in London on January 15th.
THE COMMUNISTS          Tlie  National congress ox  tho  Communist  Party,  .     which was to hove been held  at salford  this  month,  has     been postponed  until April:    this step has  been taken  as     a result  of representations  made by tho Moscow Presidium     of tho Communist International which,  in the words  of     Harry pollitt, has been &quot;playing Hell  with us for holding     it before tho world  Congress.&quot;  On December 24th     Robert stewert,  who  is in Moscow as substitute member,     for Greet Britain, on the Executive of  the Communist     International informed the political  Bureau  of the     Communist Party  that:               &quot;Word  has  just been  received  by tho          Secretariat of  the proposal to hold a party          Congress in january&amp;ry, and  I em instructed to write          you asking that you will  immediately send agenda,          theses,  etc, which you propose  to discuss at  the          Congress.   I have further to  direct your attention          to the fact that the decisions of  the Fourth          Congress anticipate that  par/by Congresses will          only be  held after the  World  Congress,   The opinion          here is  that if in the  interests  of the Party  the          meeting bo  necessary, it  should  take the form  of a          Party Conference instead  of a Party congress,   The          important  difference being that  only the Congress          is entitled to  elect the  Party Central  Committee.          Tho  secretariat will probably write you further in          the  matter, as  this is  dictated  to catch the post          which leaves in half an hour. .               &quot;Please do not fail  to let  me have the          material and at the same  time, signify  whether or          not  you agree that the  meeting will take the form  of          a party Conference, as  suggested.&quot;          On January 1st  a special  meeting of the Central     Executive Committee  was held at King  Street  to consider     the abovo letter from Robert Stewert  end, according to     the minutes it  was decided,               &quot;In view of the terms of Comrade Stewart&apos;s          letter,  to postpone the party Congress  until after          the  Fifth  world Congress, which  is due  to take          place in March, and to  fix the date of  the postponed          national congress provisionally  for April 26th-27th.&quot;Dissatisfaction/
     The  Communist  Party  continues  to  take an active interestin the  affairs  of the  labour  Party  and, according to theissue of  &quot;The Workers&apos;  Weekly&quot;  dated  January 4th, addressedthe following letter to Mr. Arthur  Henderson on DecemberEOth:  it is explained, in an introductory paragraph, that                                                 the /     DiSBOtisfaction with headquarters is rife amongseveral of the provincial organisations:  in Manchesterespecially feeling is running high and the DistrictParty Committee invited the other District party-committees to attend a special conference on January 5th at Opendhaw.Headquarters took great exception to this stepordered the committee to cancel all the arrangements madeend wired to&apos; the committees invited instructing them not tosend delegates^ &apos; As the national meeting has been postponedthe Manchester District Party Committee has temporarilyabandoned its project but states that:          &quot;We do however still contend that a conference of     representatives of the District party Committees     throughout the ocuntry previous to the National     Conference is essential to gaining the bast results     for our Party and as the District party Committees     in each District are the authoritative bodies debarred     in the constitution from representation at National     Conferences we shall still persist in our endeavours for     such a conference to be arranged prior,to the National     Conference when called&apos;,&quot;     The general trend of criticism of headquarters isvoiced  by Ellen Wilkinson,  who stated on January 3rd:          &quot;I hope there is  some straight talking going     to be done at the conference.   The Headquarters ere     ruining the party until to-day there are I believe     more communists outside the party than in it.    The     Party has a wonderful  opportunity now,  one that may     never recur again,  and  if it is to be  thrown away  and     the magnificent work of the rank and file, frustrated     again,  as it has been  continually since late 1921,  then     drastic moved will  have to be  made.   Headquarters  have     allowed the &quot;Left Wing&apos;lead to fall into the hands  of     the Clyde and Glasgow  LLP. members.     This  position     has got to be retrieved,  either with Murphy,  Inkpin     and Co.,  or without them.   I believe that the  latter     is the only course,  and I believe that has got  to  be     said at the conference.  That  is why I am so  thankful     that the Conference is  to be held.    Meantime,  I  am     net accepting C.P.  engagements until the. whole  position     is cleared up.   We  must make a stand.:!&apos;
* 8 Mthe proposals mad9 as to the  imraeditte  policy to  headopted &quot;ere put  forward as a minimum basis within  the framework of the  Labour Party*s existing platform.&quot;     &quot;Peer Mr. Henderson,          &quot;The Cent re 1 Executive Committee  of the     Communist party wishes to express  its  very great     satisfaction at the success of the Labour party     in the recent parliamentary elections.  The  seed  sown     by the pioneers of socialism is now producing a harvest     rich with possibilities  for the working class.  The     Labour Party has the  honour of gathering in  that     harvest,  but it also  has the very  heavy end  serious     responsibilities of stewardship.          &quot;In carrying out the obligations  this stewardship     imposes on it, there  will be the ever-inoreeBing     opposition of the privileged classes to contend     against.   The Central Executive Committee of the     Communist party, recognising this, desires to place     on record its willingness as n working-class politioal     organisation to asBist the Labour  party to the  utmost     of its ability.  We believe that the Labour  Party, in     taking office, if and when the opportunity offers, can     defeat every intrigue of its opponents by 8  straight-     forward declaration of policy that will unite the whole     working-class movement in support  of Labour.  Such a     declaration  should  include:     1.   Full Trade Union trade for the unemployed  against          the time when useful work will be provided; &apos;     2.   Adoption of a national housing scheme,  restoration          of rent control,  and no evictions;     3.   A complete application of the findings  of  the          Sankey  Commission,  which involved nationalisation          of the  mines,  with  a minimum  wage of miners;     4.   Immediate and  complete recognition of Soviet          Russia;     5.   A conference of  oil nations,  including  Russia          and  Germany,  for the settlement of all  outstanding          questions affecting the peace of  the  world.          &quot;In putting forward these suggestions we are quite     satisfied that the  policy to be pursued is receiving     the serious  and continual attention of the leaders     of the Labour Party,  but we feel it is our right and     duty,  at  suoh a time,  to offer advice  whioh  our very     considerable experience  of the workers&apos;  struggle enables     us to give.          &quot;Please accept this as an earnest of  the very     sincere desire of the  Communist Party  to help.  We     hail  the  present  triumph of the Labour party, end will     throw all our energy  into making that  triumph a lasting     victory for  the cause  of the workers,  - Yours     sincerely,          &quot;On  behalf of the Central Executive  Committee     of the Communist  Party.                           Albert Inkpin,  seoretary,&quot;                                                     The/
     The Political Buroeu of the Communist Party has decidedto send Harry Pollitt to Moscow to ask for the advioe of theComintern &quot;on the attitude the party should take up inrelation to Labour Government and t*lso in connection withParty candidatures.&quot;     A motion in favour of communist uffiliation with theLabour party caused some commotion at the annual conferenceof the Scottish Division of the Independent Labour party onJanuary 5th:  a Glasgow delegate, whose bona fides weredisputed, was foroibly ejected and the action of the chairmanin not allowing the motion to be put, on the grounds that the branch submitting it was not represented, was ratified by85 to 38 votes.     In response to the request by Headquarters for the names of suitable communist Parliamentary candidates theScottish organiser has submitted the following names andcomments:                         &quot;J.R. Campbell,&quot;                          A. Ferguson,                          I. Bell,                          J. McBain,                          A* Geddes,                          G, Aitken.          &quot;Ctfflpholl is in the national Union of Clerks and     would  require to be a Divisional Labour Party Candidate.     Geddes and myself are at present working up     Constituencies.          &quot;McBain and Bell have very good trade union     connections and should be well supported by the trade     union element.          G. Aitken is in the Amalgamated Engineering Union     find has. a pretty fair trade union influence in A-.E.U.     in Lanarkshire.&quot;     Distribution seeietaries  of perty  literature havebeen  informed  by  Headquarters  that;          &quot;How that  the  General  Election  is over we     must work to consolidate  our position.  -All over     the country  Party members have been  canvassing  for     Communist or labour Party candidates and have- thereby     gained  knowledge which  should  be  of  greet use  to  them.          &quot;All those  who voted -labour  ere possible  buyers     of-the  &quot;Workers1  Weekly&quot;  end  should  be  canvassed  to                                                        that/
that end.  If you have he en able to make a list oflikely people, so much the better,  in any case you willhave an idea where they are to be found.  Theimportant thing is to pegin right away before theinterest aroused by the election has died down.     &quot;luring the election our circulation went up to54,000.  It hes now sunk back to 44,000, the figureat which it stocd before the eleotion.  This indicates that the Party has so far failed to reap the advantages in the shape of increased circulation of the Partyorgan to which its expenditure of time and effortduring the election should have entitled it.&quot;The Oldhara local Party committee has won the Moscowbanner promised to the group which &quot;achieved thegreatest percentage increase in their quota of sales of &apos;The Workers&apos; Weekly1 during the period April -July, 1923.   The banner has not yet arrived fromRussia but...our comrades are making it and when it comes it will be presented to Oldham looel&quot;     District ef-ganisers have been informed that:          &quot;The queBti*n of the-weekly grant from     headquarters to the district party committee     has again been under consideration of the Central     iaceeutivO Committee.          &quot;Subsequent to the cessation of the weekly     grant on 24th November, the Executive Committee     out of the special fund that was raised for     the purpose of the pjarliaisentary eleotion, were     able te make an additional grant to the district     party committees and as this special grant was     in no case less than the total amount that would     have been sent had tho ordinary weekly grants     been continued until tho end of the year, it was     hoped that this special arrangement would enable     the district party committees to oarry on their     work without modification until the new year.  We     were also hoping that by tht end of the year we     might be in a position to Judge whut the Party&apos;s     resources were likely to be for 1924 and whether     it would be possible and If so to what extent to     renew the weekly grants.  This latter, however,     we ere unable to do at the moment.          &quot;On the other hand we have a small balance     remaining from the parliamentary fund out Of     which it will be possible for us to resume the     weekly grants to the distriot party eonmittees     for the four weeks in January.  These four special     weekly grants will be on the same basis as     heretofore, namely  1.10.0. per week and the first     of the new weekly payments will be sent you on     Friday next.                                                &quot;As/

There have been two further instansea of the craws of Russian ships attending meetings in this country:  the Chief Constables inform me that on December 30th twelve of the crsw of the S.S.. &quot;Watislaw Vorovsky&quot; attended a communist meeting in Newcastle and on January 3rd tea cf  tho crew of the S*S. &quot;Georgia Sedoff&quot; were on the platform cf a labour meeting held in Liverpool.      The Workers1 Party of Canada has agreed to arrange a propaganda tour for Tom Boll, to begin in April next and  lias suggested that the Ameriosn Communist Party might also organise some meetings for Bell,      Arthur MacManua has stated that he will not seek ro-election to tho Bxeoutivs cf the Communist Party as. hs desires to visit America and Australia as &quot;colonial organisers&quot;.      Jacob Priis, t?ho has in the past acted as  an agent of Mosocw in this oountry,  arrived In Lcndon this week:  he  is in touch with a leader of the Communist Party and has informed him that the object of his visit is &quot;to write about everything important just now&quot;.^.lS?-A0T7YrTY IN TPADB UNIONS      Tho communists are  not only maintaining but are increasing their efforts to permeate important trado unions: below are given quotations from the ;;secret  &quot;Tcductrial Bulletin&quot;, dated January 1st, 1924, which prove tho                                               more oonmuaist belief in the axiom that &quot;there is no/ import ant and immodiata work for the Party than work among trado luiiona&quot;:      J^Canvassing Methods.           &quot;When rr.y of our Party members are supporting                                                  candidates/
- 7 .- candidates for any position  in  the Trade Unions, groat care should he taken to seo that  this is dono in as tactful a way as  possible,   go, many of the Unions have rules preventing canvassing ma similar boosting methods, that  if any of our members were found to be concerned  in this, it  wbulfl inevitably lead to t-hair disqualification.  In  every case  therefore it should never be made known that any of  our members are being supported under instructions,.  Further, care should be taken never to circulate^ any  typewritten matter onhel^pi^o^^auy f^&amp;i^^STT^^^^^^^^B are aar&quot;frghtr&quot;&quot;lYe&quot;&quot;mentibn&quot;&quot;th.ese&quot;&quot;things because as our work grows more effective every effort will be made by the Trade Union officials to prevent our members gaining important positions. &quot;Hue 1 aus Orggnlsa t ion^     &quot;As far as can be  judged from reports to the-Centre, or from their absence,  there  is still in several Districts and unattached Locals, no proper industrial organisation.  The lest year has shown  that where Party members have been organised  for work within Trade Unions and Trades Councils,  really effective and important work can be done,  by  which the party can pull more weight than  its numerical  strength would apparently make possibleP     &quot;In connection with nucleus organisations, it is very important that ws  should get regular reports of the industrial organisation  existing, the work being done, and the difficulties encounteredo     &quot;Two special classes of information would bo very useful.   Will you urge all comrades to report as far as possible  in advance when elections are coming off in their trade, union?  There is no  means of our knowing of most  of those elections unless they come in from reports  from members directly affscuoc.  It is of great assistance sometimes to be told at once what area is covered by a particular district, and what Party members  or  known  sympathisers  stand a chance of being nominated  or elected^  Farther, when nominations are in, we often  can get no  know let?, go of whether comrades get nominated  or not,  or whether more than one is on the list for a single  vaceohey end so on.  will you please instruct all comrades to keep this job In mind?  There ixiell  been enough unpleasant confusion as a result of two  comrades  being up for the same position, and enough opportunities lost by nominations not being supported by all  the Party forces in  several parts of the electoral  district...     &quot;Further, information is desired about any vigilenca committees. Left Wing groups, minority movements, in  any industry,  etc., whether dominated by Party members  or  not.&quot;Trade Union  Journals.     &quot;Another reminder to take all possible advantages of Trade Union journals..  Follow up existing controversies  or invent new  ones.  Try  and convert the correspondence columns  into  real fruitful platforms in which points of  importance to the development of the                                             Party&apos;s/
    Party&apos;s activities are  dinned in more and more.    &quot;Independent Working Class Education,         &quot;Now that both the Amalgamated Union of Building    Trade Workers and the National union of Distributive    and Allied Workers are  affiliated to the National    Council of Labour Colleges,  it is important that Party    nuclei in these unions  should use their influence to    got suitable party members chosen for the District    Councils for Industrial Working Class Education,.,    &quot;Dockers.         &quot;Every effort should be made to stimulate port    propaganda committees,  in spite of the very small    party membership.  The  immediate duty of any suoh    committees that are formed should be to koep the    Transport and General workers&apos; Union up to the merk    with the demand for a wage increase next month.    &quot;tAmalgamated Soolety of woodworkers.         &quot;If there is still time, all comrades in the    Amalgamated society of woodworkers should be urged to    do their boat to get nominated for delegate to the    1924 Trades Union Congress.  When the list of    nominations  is published thero will be time to deoide    on the Party candidate  in oaoh district, and to see    that he formally accepts nomination according to rule.    &quot;Amalgamated SOQiety of Looomotive Engineers end Firemen.          &quot;Will you please take all steps if you are within    the appropriate eleotoral district, to seoure the    election of  Comrade T.YF.

But the people who are    managing the conference are such old handB that it is    certain to be no eeBy job to get our amendments across.    Every care should be taken to tie delegates down tothe/

Tho sentiment of    class solidarity is still exceedingly frail.  The average    trade unionist will think twice before he comes out on    strike In response to that sentiment.
