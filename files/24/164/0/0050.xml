MEMORANDUM ON PROPOSED AGREEMENT BETWEEN   THE BRITISH DYESTUFFS CORPORATION   AND THE INTERESSEN GEMEINSCHAFT.     1.  In this memorandum an examination Is made of theproposed agreement between the British Dyestuffs Corporation andthe Interessen Gemeinschaft;   it is shown that, in its present form, the agreement would be  extremely advantageous to theGermans, paralysing to the development of the dye industry inthis country, and gravely prejudicial to the national safety.Constructive suggestions are  mads for amendment of the draftagreemento                     I,  Retrospect.     2.  Before 1914 Great Britain drew nine-tenths of itscoal-tar dyestuffs from abroad - mainly from Germany - at a cost of  2,000,000 a year.     3.  After the war broke  out the need for a strong and independent dyes tuff Industry in this country was brought home to the Government directly it became apparent that the firstseven divisions of the regular army would be an insufficientcontribution to the military forces of the Allies.   In October1914 it was impossible to obtain khaki dye for military uniforms.It had been supplied from Germany.   Messrs. Levinsteinsucceeded in producing by a mixture of other dyes a colourapproximating to the right shade which filled the gap to acertain extent, and certain substitutes were used.   Indigo fornavy clothing failed because  the supply came from a German firmat Ellesmere Port which was&apos; sequestrated by the Board of Tradeand remained closed until bought by Levinsteins.   Only thefinal  stages of the manufacturing process were carried on at
                                                          q r: oEllesmere Port, and both these and the initial stages had tobe worked out before a new supply became available.   the civilian public had to be satisfied with what they could get.The shortage of dyestuffs wa3 accompanied and followed by asimilar shortage of explosives such as picric acid and T.N.T.,the supply of whioh would have been immensely facilitated bythe existence of a well-balanced and stable dyestuff industry with the scientific staff this implies.     4o  Accordingly a company was formed in 1915 - BritishDyes,, Ltd., - with a capital of  3?000,000, half of which wassubscribed by the Government, to purchase and extend the works of Read Holliday and Company of Ruddersfield.   The bulk ofthe remaining  capital was found by the dye users, subscriptionfor shares by  the general public being excluded.   In spiteof all efforts to accelerate building and equipment, in spiteof an arrangement with the Swiss firms for the supply of  &apos;dyestuffs in exchange for raw materials and intermediates, andin spite of the encouragement of the huge profits,other Englishcolour firms were able to make at that time, the demand stilllargely exceeded the supplyo   The processes for all inter-mediates except the simplest, such as aniline and toluidine,had  first to be worked out in the laboratories and the resultput  into manufacture before  the  firms could begin  to make the colours  themselves * for many of which the processes ofmanufacture&apos; were unknown.    Behind all this, a shortage  of fuming  sulphuric acid  (oleum) required for explosives was revealed.   The dependence of Great Britain on Germany had been slowly  but  persistently  brought  about by a systematic policy of prlcercutting and a  skilful,  gratuitous service-organisation
which, had made the British dyer scientifically subservientto the German supplier of the dyes he used and the. Britishdyestuff manufacturer merely an assembler for Germanintermediates and half-manufactured products,     5,  Chemical warfare commended in April 1915,   Atfirst simple chemical materials, such as chlorine and phosgenewhich could be made by the heav?/ chemical industry, were employed for offensive purposes.   As the war progressed,the science of chemical warfare rapidly developed, each sidestruggling to secure the advantage of the surprise use ofnew chemicals for specific purposes.   The organic substancesused became Increasingly complex, and for their production ineffective quantity the assistance of an organised organicchemical industry and of a highly qualified  personnel became more and more essential.   At  the end of the &quot;chemical&quot; warthe substance of greatest all-round  importance was &quot;mustard.gas&quot; --, which experience showed could only be effectivelyproduced by a staff  of the type necessary to a we11-equippeddyestuff works.   The present  hearing before the  RoyalCommission  on -Awards to  Inventors  Is of great interest  inthis  connexion.   The next stage,  therefore, was  that theGovernment,  realising the  importance of a flourishing colourindustry to  (a)  the  survival of the  textile  industries  -the  largest  of  our  staple  trades,  (b) the production of modern explosives,  (c) the production of  gases and other substances  needed  for  chemical warfare,  (d)  the  production  ofOther substances  which  were  being  experimented  with were   &quot;D.A.&quot;  and  &quot;D.MU&quot;  (di-phenyl-arsene-chloride and an   arsenic derivative of  di-phenylamint;.),

This step was themore imperative because the German dyestuff firms hadbeen combined into a single Cartel called the IntersasenGemeinschaft, with a capital of  40,000,000 at par ofexchange and a corps of over 1,000 chemists.   At thisstage the Government exchanged the debentures ?rhich ithad previously held in British Dyes Ltd,, for 850,001Preference Shares of  1,  and 850,000 preferred ordinary shares  of  1, In the new  Corporation.   There are twoGovernment directors with special voting powers to securethe permanent British  character of the undertaking and prevent shares being held directly or  indirectly byforeigners.             II.  Facts  of the Dyestuff Industry,      6.  If  the  significance  of the proposed agreementbetween the  I.G. and the  B.D.C. is to  be properly under-stood,  certain  fundamental/K   In order  to  assist  in  the production  of  a  sufficient  supply       of well-educated young chemists  with  some training in       research,  the Department  of  Scientific  and  Industrial       Research  has, since 1916,  made grants to 375  of the       moat brilliant university graduates in  chemistry to       enable them to be trained in research in preparation       for employment by the chemical Industries and by       Government in its own research establishments, K*  The odd Preference  share carries these special voting       powers.
fundamental facts of the dyestuff industry must be clearlygrasped.     1, Success In this industry depends on continuous and active research in a manner and to a degree much greater than is the case with other industries -. even .so-called scientificindustries.   In other industries the profits come in the mainfrom the sale of staple products.   Science may improve the processes of manufacture,  may improve the quality or lower the price of these products, but the range of investigationhowever wide, is at any rate limited by the more or lesssteady demand for a definite range of goods.   This is notthe case with the dyestuff industry.   It is not a staticindustry.   It is under a  constant necessity of producingnew products to meet  and even to stimulate the demands offashion besides improving and cheapening the production ofcertain staple lines such as indigo.   The major part of theprofits come from new dyes which, until they can be imitatedby other firms, are the monopoly of the Inventors.   When once a new dyestuff can be supplied by competitors, the big profitsfall.away and its place must be- taken by some other new product, fThe research staff of each firm must therefore be large and ofthe highest efficiency and originality.   Moreover, since the margin between profit and loss depends largely upon theperfection of operation in the factory, a large staff ofworks chemists and engineers is equally necessary.     ii. Even so, a dyestuff factory will find it difficult in future -to make profits unless what may be called the bye-products of Its research staff are exploited to the utmost.Research In the aromatic compounds yields not only colouring                                                /matters
matters but synthetic essences, photographic chemicals,drugs, insecticides, and the like,   A large part of theprofits of the German firms come from these side lines..  Inthe drug market fashion is also an Important factor, but thevalue of a really important drug can be illustrated by the discovery of salvarsan (606) or the new Bayer 205, the valueof which latter as a cure of sleeping sickness ia such thatthe Germans thought of offering the secret in exchange fortheir lost African colonies,,   The economic importance ofthese side lines to the colour industry is emphasised bythe facts of the world market for dyestuffs in relationto post-war productive capacity,     iiio In 1913 Germa   supplied rather more than 74$ ofthe world market for dyes, Switzerland and Great Britainstanding next with 7$ and 6*5% respectively.   The UnitedStates of America produced 3=3$.   Great Britain imported18,000 tons of coal-tar dyestuffs, mainly from Germany,To-day, under the Byestuffs ActP the bulk and range of importation is small,, though a considerable quantity hasbeen delivered as part of &quot;reparations&quot;,   The United Statesof America imported before the war about 35,000 tcns0   In1920 the United States of America production was about 4-4.000tonsc   It is obvious from these figures (quoted by theEnoy dopes-     Britanniea) that the market for German dyesapart from &quot;reparations&quot; must have fallen by over 50,000 tons. Moreover, the American, like the British, market is closedto all foreign dyes except under license.   This is equallytrue of Prance, Italy and Japan,   According to the Encyclo-pss    Britaxmioa. the distribution of the world marketbetween the various producing countries in-1921 is not                                        /even
even approximately known, &quot;but it is certain that, the5orId&apos;s producing capacity as distinct from actualproduction was,.f a.^ in excess of any like3.y demand&quot;.     iv,, The relation, of a flourishing dye stuff Industry tothe manufacture of high explosives and of gases and other products required for chemical warfare needs to be properlyunderstood,,   As for explosives, two main products are atpresent.in question, viz. picric acid and trlniiro-toiuoie(TiN.Tc),   Both require nitrating operations for their production, such as a dye.works performs, but there  is a limit to the size of nitrating vessels, and the amounts ofthese products required for any serious military or  naval operations would be vastly in excess of what could be turned out with the nitration plants of even large colour works.The notion that the sole interest of defence in the  dyestuffindustry is the existence of certain types of plant  in thiscountry is absurd, even from the standpoint of explosivesand still more from that of chemical warfare.   We have by no means reached finality in the selection and use ofexplosives, and, as already mentioned, the constantintroduction of new offensive chemicals is an essential feature of chemical warfare.   &quot;The idea which seems tohave become prevalent that the plant in a colour works is capable of turning out anything from a finished dyestuffto mustard gas or any new product that may come along isuntenable.   What is really wanted.......... .&apos;.ls a body ofalert scientifically and technically trained chemists.i,..for the chemist best suited by training and hab^t of mindfro cope with an emergency problem ii the colour chemist&quot;.

     7.  In  the  light of the four preceding paragraphs, thefollowing quotation from a speech delivered by Lord Moultonto a  meeting  of representatives of the textile trades of lancashire  and  Yorkshire in December 1914 before the floatingof the original national company &quot;British Dyestuffs, Ltd,&quot;is peculiarly significant:^               &quot;There must be a great national effort to           create a company, working under the conditions           of  other companies, suffering from its blunders,           and profiting by its wisdom, but  there were three           conditions to be satisfied, or it would be a failure.           The first condition was that it must be large,,           and,  therefore, independent and beyond attack.  It           must  also be national in the sense that it will           be  removed for ever from the temptation of listening           to  the voice of the charmer inviting it to enter a           combineo   The Company must be not only powerful           but ore the loyalty of which was necessarily beyond           all doubt, and that could only be got by Government           assistance on such terms that the Government could           stop  it ever entering the backward path which           would ruin its national unity.    It must also  be           co-operative.   The producer must be the consumer,           and they would never link up all  those industries           unless  those who used the dyes were Interested           in  the  production and therefore supplied a           preferential market.   If a company were formed           under those conditions it would be assured a long           and successful existence, but if  any one of the three           essentials was omitted, it was predoomed to failure&quot;,Lord Moulton  realised  the foregoing considerations to the  full,and his  three conditions should be borne in mind in  studying theproposed agreement  between the  B.D.C, and the I.G.                   III.    The Proposed Agreement,     8,  The draft agreement  between the B.D.C. and the I.G. (drafted by the Germans) which  is not completely unambiguous, contains,nine articles.    The provisions of  the agreement  have been rearranged below so  as  to  bring  out more clearly the  four different but related questions  with,  which it deals.   They are:-                                                    /(I)

It is  not clear whether the holders  of this        share are to be  the Government nominees or not,        and  if  not, who  they are to be.  It is essential        to know this.               IT.    The Effects of the Agreement,  &apos;     9.  It  remains to consider the results the agreement, ifoompleted, will bring  about,  First,&quot;what  is  claimed  for  it by the B.D.C?  Their  case  may be taken to  be  that containedin Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame&apos;s  covering  memorandum, It istwo-fold:- (a)  the agreement will  enable the  B.D.C, to lower the prioe of dyestuffs  in the United EinS^om to a figure comparable with those  charged  in other countries and so silence  the growing complaints  of British  dye users;(b) it &quot;will give them twice their present output&quot;.   It iaobvious that so long  as  the present disparity continuesbetween German and British salaries and wages the pricesof dyestuffs In this  country  cannot be brought down to continental  prices unless  either British methods  ofmanufacture  are more  efficient than the German, which,                           -11-
                                                         IJ f\ f)                                                         45 0 ^broadly speaking1, is not the case,  and will never be thecase under the agreement, as indeed II03.  (1) to (3) of theagreement show, or alternatively, unless  German dyestuffsan; intermediates are purchased by the B.D.C. at cost price in large quantities and profits averaged under Ho. (4).     10.  Turning next to the second claim of the B.D.C.that the agreement will double their present output, it isequally obvious that, leaving &quot;Reparation&quot; dyes out of account as a constant factor for some time to oome, it willbe impossible to double the output of the B.D.C factories atthe expense of imported dyestuffs, for the import of theseunder the Dyestuffs Act is too small to provide this margin.If, therefore, the &quot;output&quot; is to be doubled as distinct fromthe sales, it can only be at the expense of the other colourfirms in this country, the most important of which areScottish Dyes, the British Alizarine Go., L.B. Holliday, andthe Clayton Aniline Co.   This would mean putting some,or all of them out of.business.  Moreover, as the agreementforces the B.D.C. to purchase all &quot;intermediates&quot; not manu-factured by themselves from the I.G. (g 8), a heavy blowwill be struck in the process at tho British heavy chemical industry r Brunuer Mond, the United Alkali Company, and others.The probability is that the increase of business coming tothe B.D.C, here will come so far as it is &quot;output&quot; at theexpense of other dyestuff firms and of the heavy chemical industry, and so far as it is agency business at the expenseof the manufacturing activities of the B.D.C. as well.Incidentally, the policy calls for the abandonment of the dyestuffs Aot and the Safeguarding of Industries Act so far                        -12-
                                                                  t                                                         tl tj eias synthetic organic chemicals are concerned.  On the showingof the B.D.C, itself the agreement must weaken the chemical :industry (both organic and heavy) in this country.     11.  But the effects will he more serious than this,.  Inreturn for help in securing an overwhelming predominance -if not a monopoly in the United Kingdom   the B.D.C, give up, all claim to a share of the markets outside the Empire.America, Italy and Japan are practically closed marketsalready.  Prance has an agreement with, the I.G. and is alsoclosed, hut China and South America are as yet open.  TheB.D..C. will .aiso have only a share - not yet defined - of theBritish Empireincluding the important. Indian market,  Thefree use of German, patents applies only to this country, andif manufacture is started In India or the dominions, undefinedroyalties will have to he paid under German patents, andthere will he no German assistance in starting the manufactureof dyestuffs hut only;in the manufacture of  other organiccompounds on which.a profit i3 far more difficult to makewithout the support of a dyestuff industry..  On the otherhand, the Germans, will have full knowledge of all B.D.C.secret processes and presumably free licenses under all the3.D.C. patents, whether used in Germany or elsewhere..      IB,,  The admission of German Colour chemists and teohnolb-gist o to the B.D.0,, works, contemplated under Ho,2  (a) and putin the /forefront of the draft agreement, must naturally tendto subordinate British  initiative to German  - indeed the wholeagreement assumes that  Germany has and will have more to  teachUs than vice-versa - and were it not so there would be no ground for paying a share of the British profits to the Germans,.The more the British chemists had. to give the Germans, the lesswould a cash payment be justified, ana as. the directors of the
B.D.O. are no doubt determined to get value for their money, there will be no iuoentive to increase the bulkof new knowledge to be given to the Germans, far less to reach a position in which our chemists would give morethan they received.  The recent reduction of researchstaff is obviously directly traceable to the anticipationthat this agreement would be completed.  The whole historyof British Byes Ltd., and since then, of the B.D.O., points in the same direction.  The Technical Committee and theAdvisory Counoil of distinguished chemists appointed on the foundation of British Dyes Ltd., were soon disbanded.-  TheB.D.O., which started with about 80 research chemists, has reduced them progressively to 30, and since these negotia--tions were concluded, to 19.  The technical department,which has also been, reduced in numbers, is not included.in .these figures.  The company since its first inception in1915 has had three distinguished colour chemists asDirectors of. Research, Professor G.T. Morgan, P.H.S.,Professor Robinson, F.R.S.; and Professor A.G. Green, J.R.S.It has&apos; lost them all.  It has allowed members of its research and works staff to take with them without let or-hindrancethe secrets of its laboratories and processes, end some havetransferred their -knowledge to competing firms with serious results upon the profits of the Corporation.  It hasexcluded from the board of directors the only man who wasa colour chemist and knowledgeable in the business of thedyestuff industry.  The present directorate includes noman of scientific education or training.  With this recordduring the days of independence, what, Is likely to occurunder the agreement?     13.  And what will be the immediate effects*on thequestion of national defence?  With the secrets that will go over at once will be a new and promising process forthe synthetio production of formaldehyde.   This compound

It will he impossible once theagreement is signed for the service departments to collaborate with the largest colour firm in this countryin the solution of any chemical problems involved indefense for fear of immediate transference of the information to Germany, and. if, as must be anticipated, the other dyestufffirms are squeezed out of existence, the fighting services will have no means whatever of trying out new substances ona fall manufacturing scale or even securing the reservation of special plant,  On the outbreak of a future war, thesupply of equipped chemists with the necessary factory .experience would be even more meagre than it was in 1914-1whilst the largest research.&quot; organisation for organicchemistry which ha3 yet existed in this country would havebeen disbanded or reduced to insignificant proportions.     14.  A possible, though not necessary, effect of theagreement would be that the B.D,C. could. -           (a) stop all manufacture on their own;           fb) import all dyes at German cost prices;           (c) sell them at prices only subject to              the - competition of dyeStuff firms.in              this country and  (after the Dyestuffs              Act comes to an end) of firms abroad,              Cog., Swiss and American producers;           (d) make a large profit which-they would              obtain at the expense of other British              firms and which they would share with              the Germans.e Department of Scientific and Industrial Research have  been working on this problem for some two years without  much success hitherto.
There is indeed no possible guarantee that :prices wouldbo lower, as suggested in the agreement.  &quot;Intention&quot;means nothing.  The effect of suoh a policy as thatoutlined above would be to discourage British manufacture and encourage foreign manufacture.  The lower the prices charged, the more serious would be the effect on theBritish Industry as a whole.  The total profit of thedyestuff industry that can be made out of the british market, wherever the dyos are made, mast under the be3tconditions be small in comparison with the totalindustrial profits of this country.  Before the war theprofits made by the makers of dyes out of tho British .market cannot have been more than  500,000 a year.  Thereasons for establishing an independent industry in thiscountry are not the profits to be made out of it, butthe considerations summarised in paragraph 3 above.   Thedraft agreement does not help to produce a self-supportingBritish industry for it must be assumed;iiod that for years tocome wages and salaries will be higher in Great Britainthan in Germany, and this factor combined with the termsof the agreement is fatal 1$ its results.  Under presentconditions there is -        fa) a strong inoentive to manufacture,           as no profits oan bo obtained without           manufacture,        (b) a possibility of building up a self-           supporting Industry if the management           is intelligent.Under the proposed agreement there is little or no incentive to manufacture^ for high profits can be made without it.
D o *f15.   Two other points should he made.   The clause dealingwith the sharing of profits with the 1.6. makes a writing down of the capital of the B.D.C.essential, and this is; the only-clause in the agreement that gives the Government a directleverage over the agreement.   The Government nominees havethe power, however, under Aot 10 of the existing Articles of association to use Share Ho. 969,575 to resist the inclusionof the new Article provided for in Clause 9 of the agreement.     16.  Finally, the last two clauses of the draft seem tomake it practically impossible, short of an Act of Parliament,to escape from or to modify the agreement, once signed, for aperiod of fifty years.   The passage in $8 of the draft a3 toan alteration of the method of business is probably intendedto guard against the nationalisation of the industry by either of the parties.             V.   Summary.17.  To sum up, the agreement will -        (a)  cloae foreign markets to this country.             It would be impossible - to recover them             after 50 years;        (b)  share the markets of the Empire in             proportions not ascertained, and hamper             the development of a dyestuff industry             in India and the Dominions;        (e)  discourage the manufacture of dyestuffa             In Great Britain, and encourage their             manufacture in Germany;        (d)  diminish the home and Imperial markets             of the heavy chemical industry and the             home market of the Indian chemical             manufacturer;        (e)  share the profits with Germany on an             Increasing scale;        (f)  discourage, if not destroy, research             In the dyestuff industry.  Business    *             advantage will lie in giving the Germans             lees than they give ua,  and there will             be no stimulus to the chemist to work             for independence fifty years hence;
             (g)  hand over at once certain information                  important both for defence and for                  civilian purposes;             (h)  seriously diminish at once the help,                  the dyestuff industry can give to the                  service departments,and probably                  destroy its power of helping entirely                  SB the smaller firms fall out of                  product ion;             (j)  put the industry at once under the                 - scientific, technical and conns rci&amp;l                  control of Germany and keep it so for                  a period longer then any man now In                  active life can hope to survive.                    VI.  Suggested Amendments.     18,   It is not suggested for a moment that no agreement should, be made between the B.Do0, and the I0G. , but it is submitted that      the Government should do its utmost tosecure that any agreement entered into shall be subject to conditions that will (a) encourage rather than inhibit a growing intensive prosecution of research by the British firm;(b) avoid assisting the German dyestuff industry (the most powerful and well-equipped in the world) to compete with andundercut other British dyestuff firms and manufacturers ofintermediates;  and (o) ensure as far as possible that thefullest use is made of the discoveries of British chemistsworking for the B.D.C     19.   The truth is that the British dyestuff industry hasnot yet been firmly established, and until it is, any (agreement as comprehensive as that under discussion is highly dangerous.It ia not an agreement for an alliance but for a protectorate-with a tribute to the superior power.   An agreement for a division of the world markets still open Is no doubt highly desirable and even necessary, for the combined productive power  *of Germany and this country is far in excess of probable demands.A fair price agreement would also be valuable and indeedessential if any of the markets were to be shared on a percentage basis, but the Germans, &quot;ho are frightened on                     . -18-                     i.i
the one  hand by  the  shadow of French political absorption oftheir  principal  colour  works, and on the other by the spectreof communism,  will not  limit their demands to these two pro-visions  so  long,as there  Is a hope of establishing a technicalhegemony.    Were it  not for the French and the communists., theI.G. would  refuse any agreement In the certain faith that theywould reconquer  the  world of coal-tar colours.  Their fear ofFranoe led  them  first to make a similar agreement with theFrench,  which  la described as less favourable than the present draft, and  then  to attempt a re-insurance with us, the one enemy country  in Europe that has proved that it could establish a self-sufficing industry given the necessary patience and intelligence of  direction.     SO.   When  the  B.D.C. have an active and intelligentscientific  policy, it would be possible ho doubt to go a stepfurther  and arrange  for an exchange of scientific and technical information, but such an. arrangement should be on equal terms,not under International committees on this side, with nothingcorresponding on theirs, and it should be limited to a shorter period of time and be terminable under due precautions by either side.  Under  such an arrangement it might be possibleto provide  for a sharing of profits during the early years inconsideration for the increased, knowledge and experience ofthe I.G., but as the balance beoais more eyen the German shareshould fall and not rise as it does In the draft agreement.     21.  But above and beyond all, it is essential that theGovernment should make it  a  condition of their consent tothe writing down of the value  of their shares that two changes should be made in the management of the .B.D.0,  First, ifshould be a sine-due-non that  the  Chairman of the company
and at least half the directors should devote their whole time to the business of the company and that, the Chairmanshould have no interest other than that of a shareholder inany other firm whatever, and in no case any interest evenas a shareholder in any firm concerned either with the manu-manufacture or sale of chemical products,  Next it should besecured that at least half, the directors should be eeientlfi-oally trained men, and in no case less then three in number,of &quot;shorn one should be an engineer with experience of power and chemical plant, and two should be chemists though not necees-arily colour chemists,   All three should preferably be experienced in the business side of the chemical industry.  Ifthese two conditions were fulfilled, it would be reasonable to expect that a proper relation would at once be established beiwethe scientific staff and the Board, and. that the Board would realise the elementary facets set oat in Section II above,     88,   Indeed., in the absence of these conditions it iseo probable that the shares held by the British Government&apos;sill lose all value apart altogether from the proposed agree-iaent with the I,G, ; that it would, in the writer&apos;a opinion, bea good stroke of business on the part of the State to offer a heavy reduction in the value of their shares In return forthese two reforms alone,         ,      /                          (Intd)   H.I.E.50th January 1984.
