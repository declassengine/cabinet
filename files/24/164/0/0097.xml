^BQOtMT IS TO PROHIBIT OP HIS BBIIAINIC MAJBS!PY&apos;S aOvERH!ffi33T.  -                   Memorandum by Minister  of Lab0113?.       ^ 9jfk(24)               WASHIHGTON HOURS QOflVEBTIOK.   1,   I have had under review the position with regard to  the   ratification of this Convention and I  should be glad to have the   approval of the Cabinet  of the following course of action.   2.   As my Colleagues are aware, difficulties exist in respect  of   the ratification of the  Convention In  the case of the other   important Industrial countries, and while I am of opinion that  the   failure of Great Britain to ratify tho Convention has affected  the   attitude of those  countries, I think that there are difficulties   whioh could usefully be  the subject of discussion with reprosenta-   Ives of those  countries.   I would propose therefore that a   Conference of representatives of Governments  should he called to   ho held in London  during March with a  view to reaching a  common   understanding on the subjeot of ratification.   Such a Conference   might reasonably bo limited, In the ciroumstances, to the main   European industrial countries, that Is 3elgiua, France, Holland,   Italy, Germany, czecho-Slovakis and Sweden- and possibly  Poland,   Norway and Denmark.   It does not appear to me to be necessary  to   include other countries, but, if the Seoretary of State for India   or the Secretary of State for the Colonies is of opinion  that   representatives of India or of the Dominions  should be invited, I   should, of course, offer no objection, except that other  extra   European countries might then have to  be considered.   3.   if this proposal is approved by the Cabinet, the  invitations   might be issued through  the Foreign Office to the Governments   of these countries inviting them to nominate representatives to   moet me in Conference with a view to the diBoussion    the   present position of tho  Hours Convention.   4.   With regard to the  position In this oountry, I havo  had   Conferences with representatives of the  national Confederation  of                              -1-                      / Employers&apos;
Employers&apos; Organisations and the Trades Union Congress general council.     The Employers&apos; attitude is against ratification in presentciroumstane*s.  The following were their main reasons;-     (a)  It is more desirable to regulate working conditions by          voluntary agreements than by legislation,     (b)  Legislation in this country without similar restrictions          in other countries, especially the United States and          Germany, would oause irreparable prejudice to British          industry.     (o)  No other country has,  in praotioe, given such effect to          the principles of the Convention,     (d)  The Convention should not be ratified until steps have          been taken to secure that there is simultaneous          ratification by other countries and that there is          identical interpretation and&quot; identical praotioe and          enforcement in those countries.     (e )  There is no reason, but rather the contrary  to assume          that the British example will be generally followed.The Trades Unien Congress General Council has forwarded to me thefollowing resolution, passed by a special emergency meeting ofthe London members of the Council..     &quot;That this meeting fif London members of the General      Council of the Trades Uni*n Congress, hereby deoideB      that the Government be urged by deputation to the      Minister of Labour, to give effect to the desire  of      the British Trade Union Movement that the Washington      Convention be  ratified without delay, and that in the      framing of legislation to give effect thereto,  proper      provision be made whereby the special difficulties of      nartioular industries may be met,,&quot;     I have since reoeived a deputation from the General council who supported their Resolution by a number of statements,  callingparticular attention to the need to oarry out the commitmentsentered into at Washington-.                                                     75-
    5.    The necessary Bill will require careful drafting    and I do not now suggest a date for its introduction.    But in the  meantime,  I think it is  advisable that  the    Prime Ministers statement on the general policy of the    Government  should include a reference  to  this matter and    I suggest that  the reference should be on the following    lines; -         With regard to the  Convention  adopted at Yifashington         in 1919, limiting Hours of Employment to 48 per week,         it  is  the  opinion of the  Government  that, although it         is  true  to  say that  a week of  40  hours  or less  is -in         general  observance  in Great  Britain, ,the failure of this         country  to  ratify that Convention has  constituted one of         the principal reasons  why other nations  have  not seen         their way  to  accept  the  Convention.    It is the intention         of  the Government to  present to Parliament a  Bill         dealing with  the  48  hours week.    The House will remember         that there  have been various conferences of members         of  the International  labour  Organisation since  1919         at which the  difficulties attendant upon ratification        have been discussed.    In the view of the Government         the matter  should be further explored and a renewed        effort made to see on what lines agreement can be        reached.   Accordingly, Invitations are  being addressed        to the Governments of  tho other principal industrial         countries to meet my Rt. hon a Friend, the Minister        of labour in  conference with a view to a discussion        of the present position of the Hours Convention,-                                                           *                                  (Intd, ) T.
