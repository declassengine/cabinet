Ii25;0RAHDUK BY THE SECRETARY FOR 3COM.      1..  . The Draft Bill,  a. copy of which is attached hereto, has been fraided generally on the lines indicated in ray MomroanAum dated 2nd July, 1923, (cp-,301 (23)); that is to a ay.  on the lines laid: down in the Report of the Departmental Cloawiittee on the Property and Endowments of the Church of Scotland dated 4th April,  19234      2.   Trie ohl^ important variation from the recommendations of the Departmental Comclittee is with respect to the matter-mentioned in^paragraph.3 Of ay former memorandum, namely,the rede;aption dr stipends *           Ih lieu of the Committee&apos;s proposal that the capital payment by the heritors  should be such amount as would purchase sufficient consols to yield in interest a yearly sua equal to the annual  stipend to be redeemed,  the Bill (Clause 12) provides for redemption on a basis of twenty-two years&apos;  purchase.           TChere the capital  payment involved exceeds twenty-two pounds  (representing a payment for stipend of one pound a-year.) the heritor is given the option of substituting for a single capital payment a fixed  annual  charge upon the land sufficient to redeem the  stipend within a period not exceeding fifty years,  . the rate of interest, on  the,  accumulating instalments being assumed at 4jt per cent,  per  annum.      3.    The  Bill is a  necessary step in the movement for Church Union in Scotland,  and I desire authority to introduce it in the coming  Session at the earliest  poesiale opportunity.  A few points  remain for arrangement  with the Treasury but I  do not anticipate that these will., cause any difficulty.      4.    I  would refer  to the  Cabinet Conclusion (36  (23))  of 11th July last,  with which this Dill conforms,  and I propose, in the  absence of any objection from my colleagues,  to have  the Dill printed and introduced  as  soon  as Parliament meets.                                 &apos;HOVAR&apos;..Scottish Office,   Whitehall, S.V.I.4th January, 1924,

Such surrender shaU be as nearly    as  may be in the form presently in  use in the Court of Teinds, and    if there is a process of  locality pending may be embodied in  a    minute of surrender lodged hi that process, and if there is no25  depending process of locality the surrender may be signed by    the heritor or his agent and lodged  at  the  Teind Office. Any    heritor whose teiiids have been valued in accordance  with  the    present practice may exercise the powers of this Article, notwith-    standing  that such valuation  comprises the teinds of a  heritor30  other than the heritor named in the  surrender, but only where    there  has been an agreement between  the parties  interested with    respect to the division of the cumulo valuation.        (6) Surrender of valued teinds shall not be  competent unless    the minute of surrender is lodged  in a process  of locality or  the35  surrender is lodged at the Teind  Office as  aforesaid before  the    date hereinafter mentioned (that is to  say) :         (i) In cases where the teinds  are valued before the date  of            issue of the teind  roll  for  the parish in which  the            lands are  situate,  before the expiry  of  four months40          after the date  of the said issue; and        (ii) In cases where ^Jie teinds are valued after the date  of            issue of  the teind roll  for  the parish  in which  the            lands are situate, before the expiry of two months after            the issue by the Clerk of  Teinds of&apos;: a  certificate of  the45          amount of the  valued  teinds; and
1924,      (iii) In oases where the value of temds^specified in the teind-             roll for the parish in which the lands are situate  is               deemed to be  accepted by acquiescence as hereinbefore               in this Act provided,  before  the  expiry  of  six months               after the date  of issue of the teind roll for that parish.  Q:           (c) The  heritor shall  at the same time as  the minute  of       surrender  or the surrender, as the case  may  be, is lodged  as       aforesaid send a copy thereof to the. minister Of the parish, or if       the benefice is  vacant to the General  Trustees,  and the Clerk  of       Teinds shall, as soon as may be after the  lodging of the minute 10       Or of the surrender, examine the state  of the teinds in the parish  .       and calculate what deficiency of stipend (if any)  would ensue if       the  surrender  took effect, and shall notify the result of his       examination and calculation to the minister or to  the General       Trustees,  as the case  may be.  Within twenty-one days  after 15       the date of such notification the minister or the General Trustees,       as the case may be, may lodge  objections to the surrender, which       shall be finally  disposed of by the Lord Ordinary; but if no such       objection shall be so lodged the surrender shall have effect at the       expiry of the said period of twenty-one days.                   20           (d) It shall  not be a valid objection to a surrender made       under the provisions of this Schedule  that the decree of locality       on which the stipend has been paid up to the date of the surrender       has not been made final.           8. Where a surrender made under the provisions of  this 25       Schedule  has become  effectual, whether no objection has  been       lodged or any  objection  lodged  has  been  disposed of, and a       deficiency of stipend amounting to not less than ten pounds per       annum is  caused thereby, the  nimister of the  parish, or  if the       benefice is vacant the General Trustees may within ten days after 30       the  date  when  the surrender has become effectual,  intimate  in       writing to the  Clerk of Teinds that he or they claims or claim       that  the deficiency of stipend  shall be re-allocated among those       heritors in the  parish (if any) who have unexhausted teinds not       yet  allocated for  stipend.  The  Clerk of Teinds on receiving 35       intimation of the claim  shall notify the same to the common agent       6f the heritors,  and if  any heritor within  twenty-one days after       the  date  of such notification lodges with  the Clerk  of Teinds a       written objection to the claim the matter shall be finally disposed       of by the Lord Ordinary.   But if no such objection be lodged, the 40       re-allocation shall  be made by the Clerk of Teinds, who shall       issue to the minister or to the  General Trustees, as the case may       be, a certificate specifying the amounts of stipend  payable by       the heritors whose  teinds are affected  by the re-allocation.           9. Any calculation as to  the amount of any deficiency  of 45       stipend caused by a surrender in accordance with the provisions of
WMmmmmmmmam   this Schedule or as to the amounts of unexhausted teinds available  A.D. 1924.   to meet such deficiency shall be made on the basis of the standard         value of the stipend.        10. A heritor may have his unvalued teinds valued  or 5 surrender valued teinds in  accordance with the provisions of this   Schedule,  whether he  has  or has  not a heritable right  to such   teinds :       Provided that-          (a) Where  the  heritor  proposes  to have  valued or  toJO            surrender any  teinds to which he has no heritable              right, he  shall at the time when he gives notice of the-              appointment of  a valuer or lodges a minute of surrender              or a surrender  as aforesaid intimate the appointment              or the  surrender in writing to the  titular of the teinds15            who shall  have  the  same  rights  of  objection and              appeal as  are  by  the provisions  of  this Schedule              conferred upon the minister of  the  parish  or  the              General Trustees;                                s          (6) When a heritor receives from a minister  or the General20            Trustees  notice of the  appointment of a valuer with              respect to  lands  to the teinds of  which he  has no              heritable &apos; right,  he  shall  forthwith  intimate  the              appointment  in writing to the titular  of the teinds,              who shall in such case have the same rights of objection25            and appeal as are by the  provisions of this Schedule              conferred upon  the heritor.
