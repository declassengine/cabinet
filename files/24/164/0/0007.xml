(THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITAMMIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT ) .MOST, SECRET.CP. 7 (24)..P&apos;A .B I M E T.TARIFF  ADVISORY  COMMITTEE.Suggestions and Recommendations.(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister)1,   The Tariff Advisory Committee have hold in all tenmeetings and have made considerable progress.in examining the material submitted to them by tho Beard of Trade/ theCustoms and other Government Departments..2,   The Committee were given to understand&apos;that- theGovernment desired to have their recommendations at theearliest possible date and in any case not later than th.fi&quot; &apos;middle of January.   The task was a heavy one and would havebeen totally impossible of. accomplishment but fir theexcellence of the preparatory work already dene by theGovernment Departments..   The Committee desire to place on .record&apos; their appreciation of the great assistance they&quot;derivednot only from the carefully prepared material originallysubmitted to them, but also from the information which the -officials present %t their meetings were always ready and ableto give on the numerous questions arising in the course oftheir deliberations, especially with regard to the presentposition of the British industries likely to be affected bythe Tariff, and Its probalsle effects alike on production forheme consumption and for exports.   Thanks to the assistancethuB afforded them, -the Committee had, in the course of theirsittings, already come to conclusions on some of the main points involved in their inquiry and were beginning to see their way about the rest.   They had also made a oertalnamount of progress In framing a schedule of rates and it
eeemed possible that, by holding almost continuous sittingsduring December, they might be able to submit their recommendations to the Government early in the New Year.5.   When, however, the Committee met on December 7th, itwas felt that, in view of the result of the General Election,.the Government would probably have no further need of theirservioei.   In that case, it seemed to them that all that theycould do was to leave a brief record of their proceedings,without attempting to make a formal Report or to submit re-.commendations on a subject, their investigation of vrtiich theyhad not had time to complete.   The Chairman of the Committeehaving subsequently ascertained that the views of theGovernment were in accordance with these anticipations, thework of the Committee has oome to an end, and. it only remains to state as succinctly as possible, the results, necessarilylmperfeot and provisional, of their interrupted labours,4,   The deliberations of the Committee were necessarilylimited by the declared policy of the Government.   Thus dutiesupon staple articles of food were excluded from-consideration,while the Committee themselves had no hesitation in recommending that.no duty should be placed on raw materials.They therefore confined their attention to mamifactured and semi-manufactured articles05.&quot;&quot;  With regard to the tariff upon these, the Gumaittee took the view, that it should, in the first instance at anyrate, be an ad valorem tariff.   It was felt that, atpresent, the material did not exist which would enable theCommittee to decide whether or not specific rates of dutyshould be Imposed at a later date.    &apos; &apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;    &apos;            : -   -2-
        6.     The Committee were agreed that the rates of        duty should, as a&apos;general rule, he graduated according        to the amount  of  labour expended at the several    . -   stages of manufacture.  They were  further agreed  that,      .. on the first introduction of a  tariff system,  it     &apos;   would be impracticable  to have  a great number  of        rates, or  to attempt  to differentiate too nicely&apos;.-&apos;:.:.*-  between the amounts of  duty chargeable upon different       - articles of the same  general character.  They,       &apos; therefore, favoured the inclusion, of all articles,        upon which they might recommend the  imposition of;      .  a  duty,  in One of - three classes,  to be  taxed  ......    respectively 5$,  12-g$ and  20$.    It was  reserved        for further consideration  whether  in the middle        olass  -  by far the largest and  comprising goods        in more  or less  advaneed  stages of manufacture -        there  should not  be a further  division  into two or        even  three sub-classes, subject to duties  of 10$       ; and 15$, or  of 10$, 12-1$  and  16$ respectively.    Side        by side  with  these classes of  dutiable  articles,         they  held that there  should be  a Pree list  including         not only staple articles  of food and raw materials,     !   :&apos;but also any other articles,  such as pig iron, which,      f         though partly manufactured, it  might  be  desirable,            .....         for special reasons,  to place  in the same  category       1  as raw materials. \t the other end.  of  the  scale         there would be a special category, including commodities  j         which are already subject on importation to duties         of a  protective character, but exceeding 20$ - such.........................______\______........J...... t.\_______ . . ,....................

 , .  as  the  so-called &quot;MoZenna  duties&quot;  or the  duties ..  imposed under the Safeguarding of industries  Act. ...  These speoial duties it was,  in the opinion of the...... Committee (having regard to their proved value in .,... preserving or stimulating  the industries affected ... by them), desirable to retain.   The Committee were; .....engaged on the work of classification on these    .lines and had made substantial progress with it,    when their labours were suspended.    7.       Besides considering the general character    of the  Tariff and the rates of duty, to be imposed    under it, the Committee had arrived at agreement on    certain points of fundamental Importance, to which    it seems desirable to refer..&apos;              .    8...  ....   Thus it was agreed to recommend that a rebate  .  of one-third on all duties imposed under the Tariff   . should  be accorded to goods produced in and consigned    from any part of the British Empire,    9,      The Committee were also in general agreement    with the proposals, submitted by the Departments,    on the subjeot of Valuation and of the provisions    to be made for allowing dutiable goods re-exported    in  their original condition to obtain exemption from    payment of duty.   The Committee were fully alive    to the great  importance of maintaining the entrepot    trade, and they were of opinion that this object    could be achieved by a reasonable administration of    the  existing law with respect to transhipment and    bonding.  This would involve  the adoption of a system    of  &quot;constructive warehousing&quot; (i,e,warehousing in                           -4-  -
private premises subject to Customs b&amp;pefrvisioiijsuch as IS at present in use in France aha Bome1 othercountries.  The Customs Authorities are satisfiedlhat it would be possible  to make  regulations whichwould  prevent suoh  a system from giving rise to abuse,10,  -     in the course  of  the  discussion.on  thissubject, it. was  suggested  that  it. might be desirableto  institute  &quot;free  Zones&quot;, such  as exist&apos;, at: certainforeign ports..-  The Committee&apos;could see no  objection in  principle  to &quot;free  zones&quot;,. if it were  found- inpractice  that&apos; the&apos;bonding system did not.afford:sufficient facilities  for the  conduct of&apos; the entrepottrade, but they were not convinced that  it  would,.in  fact,  be  found necessary to have recourse to  this expedient,   :   -                      .        &apos;11&apos;,-     The  Committee were of  opinion that provision must be  made&apos;&apos; for the re-importation of goods.&quot;*seht abroad. to undergo some manufacturing process..  Where  the Identity, of&apos; suoh goods is&apos;not lost in the. process, they should be subject, on re-importation,, not to the full duty  chargeable  upon them  in their thencondition, but  only to  th* amount  of the  difference,if  any,- between it  and the duty  which theywouln  have paid had they been imported in the condition in which they were, in fact, exported.
12,   A more difficult question arises with regard to goods....which have paid duty on importation into this country andere subsequently re-exported after having undergone somemanufacturing process here.  -These can only be dealt with :under a system of drawback, and there is room for difference of opinion both as to the extent to which drawback shouldhe allowed and as to the best.method of determining the amountof It,   This, however,&apos; is a point which the Committee hadreserved for fuller consideration  at a later stage ef theirinquiry, and which was never reached&apos;. &apos;.. -It&apos; Is -impossible&apos; to.:give any indication of the conclusions they might, have&apos;., arrivedat on the subject, though its importance was not  overlooked.13.   Besides the question of drawback there were other points of primary&apos;, importance,: which  came up in the  course cf theproceedings, but which the Committee had not.time to threshout, though the. discussion, as far. as it went,/ afforded^some ;indication of&apos; the conclusions., to  which the minds of members were tending.14.   Thus the Committee felt that the comparative labour conditions prevailing in this country and in, the  competitivecountries and the efficiency  of the various industries in thiscountry were relevant&quot; to the  subject under consideration.15, &quot;The-Committee further considered how far it might bepossible to use a Tariff for  the purpose of making commercialbargains  with foreign countries.   It was recognised that.with,such moderate normal rates as the  Committee were  prepared to1recommend - viz. from 5$ to 20% ad.valorem - there was nst muchscope for obtaining reciprocal concessions from foreigncountries through lowering our own duties.   This considerationpointed to the  conclusion that &quot;it -might be necessary to include in the Tariff Act another scale of duties, somewhat higher thanthose recommended above, which might be used for  the purpose of negotiation with countries which did not grant fair terms to
 16.   There  is  one  further  problem, perhaps  the most important of all,  which  was  constantly ariBing  in the course of the Committee16 deliberations,  to which attention must here be called.   It will be sufficient to Indicate its character in general  terms.  No normal rates of duty, whioh it would be reasonable  to  impose in any tariff of general and permanent application, can be relied on to afford adequate protection to particular  industries, whioh are exposed, owing to exceptional ciroumstanoes, to crushing competition from imported foreign goodso  Such exceptional circumstances -  ofwhich the depreciation of a foreign eurrency or the dumping of goods to relieve a  congested  foreign market  may.serve as examples -are indeed  often only temporary,  but they maynevertheless be of sufficient duration to undermine a  home industry which,, in ordinary circumstances,  would  be perfectly well able to hold  its  own.   Moreover,  these  recurrentonslaughts,  first  upon one branch  of  industry and then uponanother, tend greatly  to increase,  over a wide  area  of the   &apos;field of production, that irregularity of employment,  which isnow generally recognised as a grave social  evil.   The  propriet of taking special  measures to deal with such calamities  is recognised in principle in the Safeguarding  of  Industries Act,but the princinaf  provisions of  that  Act  are.limited in their scope and duration;,&apos; and the anti-dumping  clauses,  which arepermanent, are cumbrous and hedged in with&apos; so many restrictionthat they are lively to prove inadequate.   And  it is not ob-viouswhy special  protection,  if the  necessity  for it  can be            j&quot;proved, should be  confined to &quot;Key Industries&quot;  or to cases,         . Iin which the ruinous competition which it  is sought to guard ag/inst is due. to dumping.       I -                               .  &apos;
17.  It may be argued that, where it can be proved that anysound British industry of sufficient importance to constitute a real national interest is threatened with ruin from anyabnormal cause, especially if the danger be of a temporarycharacter, the Government should be in a position to takeprompt and vigorous action for the defence of that industry,whether by imposing special duties, or by any other means,such as a limitation of imports.  This principle, if adopted,would involve fresh legislation, on the lines of the Safe-guarding of Industries Act, but greatly extending its presentlimits.  To a thorough investigation of this problem, however.,whioh is obviously one of great difficulty, the Committee hadnot time to devote themselves, though it had befflOme apparent that, at some stage of their proceedings,  it would have been impossible to avoid the consideration of it,18.   In this connection, but not in this  connection only, theCommittee v?ere led to the conclusion that  it would be necessaryto  create a permanent Tariff Board  to assist the Government inthe administration of the Tariff laws.  Such a body, composed,perhaps, on the Australian model partly of officials andpartly of representatives of Industry and  Commerce, would bein  a position to investigate and advise upon the appeals ofparticular industries/for protection, uhioh are alreadynumerous under existing statutes.   It would also be competent to  adjudicate upon; the many disputes about classification,valuation, and Sj forth, which are bound to arise under anyextended system of import duties.  The creation of such a body appeared desirable for two other and weighty reasons.It would de/fend the Government and Parliament from unduepressure from sectional interests, and it would inform theGovernment as to the cases, should they arise,  where the       yconsolidation of business enterprise - which is so
rapidly taking place in this country, as in other countries, and is generally conducive to economy of manufacture - might, under a restriction of imports, operate to the disadvantage of consumers.

19. The Committee were impressed with the extent of the information as to the magnitude and organisation of the several British industries, which is already in the possession of the Board of Trade. They regret, however,that the exact statistical knowledge, which was secured by the Census of Production for the  year 1907, has not been brought more nearly up to late by a  subsequent Census of the same character.
