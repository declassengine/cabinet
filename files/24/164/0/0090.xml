(I)       Tho  Committao have received  Reports  from tho Housing          Sub-Committee  (C.U.632 and 0*0.644) and after          consideration  of those Reports at their meetings  on  the          5th February,  1924  (CU. 74th Conclusions )  and the          7th February;  1924  (O.U. 75th Conclusions)  have decided          to present tho following Report.      (2)  Requirements,.               The estimate of the number of houses required is          a matter of some difficulty but clearly it  must provide          for throe things - normal expansion of  population, the          overtaking of  the accumulated shortage  and  the          replacement of unsatisfactory bousoa*               For England and Wales the number  of houses required          to meet ordinary growth may be put at about  75,000&apos;.   The          Committoo consider that a modest estimate of the          accumulated shortage of small houses would bo 300,000.          AS regards the rcplacement of tad houses, it may  bo          estimated that there aro 67000,000 small houses in          England and Wales and that the normal life  of a houso-          could not properly bo put at  more than  100 years as,,          however, a large proportion of these houses,  built          during tho period, of rapid industrial             *
      development, have still a considerable life, it would      not be necessary at once to put in hand the full      programme for the renewal of 60,000 houses per.annum.                Tho Committee propose to adopt tho following      figures aa represonting an annual programme for a      period of ten years:-                                                    Houses^          To make good the accumulated shortage,    30,000          To provide for the normal expansion           of population ......:,,v,...,&apos;,    75,000          To provide for renewals                  r 45,000                                                   150^000                assuming.ing that 50;,000 houses  per annum wore      required for Scotland, the total annual programme, for      10 years, would be 200;000 houses,,3)     P?ohlem0                The problem may, therefore,  be defined broadly      as being to supply over a period say,  of 15 years  some      2,3:L5,,0G0 houses ice. to secure in each of the fifteen years  an      average of, say 153,000 houses, which  can be let at a rent      which the workers who eroct tho houses can afford to pay from      their wages a                In this connection It may be observed that      the Chamberlain Scheme fails to meet the latter      condition for under that Scheme the houses aro to       *      a large extent being built  for sale and where they      are being built by local authorities for letting,      the rents charged are ordinarily too high for the      ordinary worker.
(4) Difficulties  to be,-overcome.          The primary diff difficulties-to -be overcoiae incurrying out a schomo p,f this kind are tho shortages in labour and in certain kinds of material:-     (a) Labour.           At the present time it- ia perfectly     clear that there aro not sufficient skilled     men in the building industry to ensure the     carrying out of a programme of the magnitude     indicated.   This no doubt results in a     large measure from the instability of     conditions in the building industry in tho     past.   The President of the Building Trades     Employers Federation stated a few days ago that in     1908 thore were from 800,000 to 900,000 men     employed in the industry, and that this     number had been reduced to about half.     In fact, with a greater population in     1924 than in 1908, the number of men in the     industry was 450,000 less than it was 15     years ago.   He was of opinion that the building     trade could place at once 100,000 additional-     skilled workers to cope with the contract work     offered.   He considered that for 200,000     houses an additional 300,000 men would bo     recpuired.   These figures are probably on the     high sido but assuming that the demand for labour     for commercial and other work than housing     remains constant, it will certainly be
necessary  to  introduce  into the  industry a largenumber  of  additional  skilled men.         ) Materials,        The  position as  regards materials is not     quite so serious  though in the matter of bricks some     considerable expansion of productive capacity would     be required to guarantee the  erection of 200,000     houses a year.   The existing plant in the country     would supply all the light castings and cement required     and there Is not likely to be any difficulty  in regard     to a  supply of timber.(5)  Pi paneing the schema.     The Committee are  convinced that arrangements must be made to secure  that the houses provided can be letat rents roughly equivalent to those paid by the workingclasses before the war  .   Thus  rente would vary with the locality but for the purpose of a general estimate thefigure of 8/- a week to cover rent arid rates may be taken.On the basis of an average cost of a house of  500, theannual loss would be, approximately  16 a year for 80 years or  38,000,000 for th total programme of 3,375,000 houses.If higher rents were attainable on the basis of letting thehouses to those workers for whom they are intended, the total loss might be somewhat reduced.  If the support of the localauthorities to. a policy of letting houses at a rent of the kindcontemplated is to be secured, generous arrangements will haveto be made as to the share of the loss to be borne by the State.This would have to be a matter of negotiation with, the local
          It is, of course,  important in the interestof economy and proper management that the localauthorities should, have a definite financial   ...interest in the,scheme.(6)   Sroad conditions which the scheme must  satisfy.The broad conditions which.must be met if a schemeis to bea success are as followsj-(a)  The  supply Over  a long  period  of  such a number    Of houses  as  will overcome  shortage,  keep  pace    with normal demand and  replace Unsatisfactory    dwellings  by healthy  houses,(b)  The  supply of these houses  at  such rents that the    ordinary worker  will  be able to live  in  them-;(o)  Security for the workmen, builders and manufacturers         of material who are asked to expand the resources of         the industry, and for the local authorities who will         be -responsible for giving effect to the scheme.     (d) Protection against profiteering.          Every practicable step must be taken to guard againstthe great increase of prices which brought the Addisonscheme to a standstill and in fact, rings of all kindswhether manufacturers, builders or workers must be prevented.The full co-operation of labour, builders, manufacturers andlocal authorities must be secured.
(7)Arrangements to be made with various Interests.  (a) Labour.   It will be necessary to approach the Unions  to secure agreement in the adoption of the  scheme to  supply  the labour necessary in increasing quantities to ensure  that  there will be no slacking and to guarantee  that the launching  of the scheme will not be used as a means of obtaining wages  they would not have been able to secure but for the Housing  Scheme.   It will be possible, to assure the representatives of  the Unions that it is the intention to provide for a  scheme  which will guarantee them against unemployment for at least  ten years, provided, houses are delivered according to a  reasonable time table.   It will also be possible to  assure  them that a primary object of the scheme is the provision  ef houses at rents which the ordinary workman will be  able to  pay.                   ,            There are two ways by which the number  of men  in  -  the industry can be increased:-        (a)  By promoting men already  in the industry to be  craftsmen j  and,    :,        (b)  By the addition of apprentices.            It should be practicable  to secure with goodwill the  addition of an  appreciable number of craftsmen, possibly  25,000 by the promotion of labourers.   The apprenticeship  question is one of very great Importance, for the condition of  the industry at present.is that it  is not.providing for  its  ordinary growth.   It is estimated  that the number of  apprentices in  the trade at present does not exceed 21,000,  while even und/er existing rules three or four times that  number would be permitted.   This question  is already engaging  the attention of a Committee of the Employers and Operatives, and it should
be practicable to  secure  a  satisfactory solution.(b) Builders...  &apos; The builders  are  again clearly interested inthe guarantee of a definite programme  covering a number ofyears,, and they will require  to be  assured on, this- point ifthey are to make the necessary expansion of their arrangements and undertake to accept apprentices  In large, numbers.The importance of  preventing  inflation of cost through undueprofits or otherwise will have to be Impressed upon thebuilders.   The fact that the  Local Authorities who willbe responsible in  the main  for carrying out the scheme willhave the direct financial interest  in  the expenditure  will serve as a valuaable check  against undue  increasing of tenderprices.   It will  be necessary, however,  for the departments to be able to assist Local Authorities  in this matter,   andthe Departments should keep detailed records of costs  whichwill enable checks to be  applied.  It  may further be  necessaryto have in reserve, a power of  direct building by the State.(c) Manufacturers  of Materials.   The  manufacturers ofmaterials also will be asked  in view of the large programme to, take steps to increase their production.   So far as    ...practicable they should adept methods  of  stendardisation andaim at low prices  by mass production.    It may be possible  tosecure, some definite agreement on the  subject of profits,  andfor this purpose it may be necessary in the near.future toundertake costing  investigations  by accountants and other experts.   In any  event definite  statutory powers must  be takenproviding for. severe penalties against  profiteeringo    It^may even be necessary  In&apos;the  last resort to take powers to takeover works closed  down by an  owner or  to  put down plant ifsupplies prove Inadequate.&apos;it 7 -
(d) Local Authorities. With the Local Authorities it will be necessary to obtain assurances of whole-hearted co-operation in the scheme, and especially acceptance of the principle that the houses are to be provided at a rent which the workmen who builds the houses can afford to pay. This will probably in the main turn on a question of the amount of the Exchequer contribution and, as suggested above, it is proposed that this should be settled on lines which would be generous to the Local Authorities while giving them a direct incentive to economy.

(B) Immediate steps to be taken. An outline of a scheme which the Committee consider will fulfill all conditions and enable the programme to be carried out with success is set out below. Preliminary conferences have already taken place with representatives of the building trade employers and employed. Meetings with representatives of building materials manufacturers are being arranged and at a later stage negotiations with the Local Authorities will be undertaken.

Outline of Legislation necessary for Scheme.

i. Provide for immediate extension of the Chamberlain scheme from October, 1925 to October, 1928.

This will start the scheme with a straight run of 5\\1//2 years under known and generous subsidy conditions. Provision would also be made for modifying the amount of assistance and for giving the assistance at different rates for any three categories of districts; assistance at highest rate to be given in districts considered most necessitous according to some tests. The modification of the amount of assistance would be made on the principle of so adjusting.   
the annual Exchequer subsidy that the local authority would be able to let the houses at a low rent withoutthrowing an undue burden on the rates &quot;whlie retaining the local authority&apos;s direct financial Interest intheir expenditure.   It is proposed that the State shareof the subsidy should not exceed an over-all average figure of       per house for     years.    Suchincreased assistance would require to be given forall houses not contracted for or the construction ofwhich was not started at the time the scheme was announced,ii,   Provide that  if at the end of 1927 an averageproduction exceeding 120,000 houses a year taken over for 2 years 1926 and 1927 had been reached for Englandand wales and an appropriate figure for Scotland,Government assistance shall be continued for 3 yearsfurther from October, 1928, i.e, to October, 1931,but the Government  in 1928 shall have the right to revise the rate of assistance in the light of the existingcircumstances.   This will make the continuance ofGovernment assistance dependent on the industrydelivering the goods and will be an incentive  to localauthorities to administer the scheme.   The builders willhave to deliver the houses at a reasonable price, thematerial makers must provide for the additional material required and the men will have to have arranged for theexpansion of the personnel,  if the scheme is killedby builders or material manufactu^ern or others inflatingthe price the Government will withdraw their assistance.  *                        -9-
 It is to be observed that the 120,000 to be aimed at at this stage is a minimum.  In actual practice all the agencies concerned, the local authorities, the building industry and the suppliers of materials would-make certain of the continuance of the scheme by exceeding, perhaps by a considerable margin, the minimum required. iii.  Provide further that if at the end of 1930 a production of not less than 150,000 houses a year, for England and Wales, and a proper figure for Scotland, has been reached over the t-&quot;0 years 1929 and 1930 assistance will be available for a, further 3 years to October, 1934, but the Government shall again have a right to review the rate of assistance for the ensuing 3 years. iv.   Provision to be made for a further term of 5 years provided that houses are built in numbers  sufficient to secure that the average production of 158,000 a year for the fifteen years is obtained in  Great Britain as a,whole.  The precise figures to be inserted in the Bill as regards Scotland need to be further considered and. some adjustment  as regards England and rfales may be required when fuller information Is available  as to the  output of the industry and the rate of probable  expansion. v.    Provide definite  powers for dealing  with profiteering in the event of the  plan of making Government assistance dependent  upon  out-put  falling to secure  the provision of materials  at reasonable prices.
