Not only must our every effort be devoted                                                          to/
THE COMMUNISTS          The National Conference of the Communist Party of     Great Britain is to be held in the Caxton Hall, Salford,     on January 26th, 27th ana possibly on January 28th. 1924,          Local organisations have bean informed by head-     quarters that:               &quot;following upon the procedure adopted in          connection, with the Battersea Confer once in October          Of-last year it is hoped at the forthcoming          conference to effect a complete break with the old                                                     style/                                                        55     to sustaining and maintaining that working olass     unity which has already ha en achieved, but it     must be further developed to its point of real     oompietion - the affiliation of the Communist     Party . *.          &quot;In the light of the present political situation,     therefore, with all its obvious duties and     possibilities, the decision of the Executive     Committee of the National Labour Party, published     above, is an historic one  The day when the     Communist Party is finally accepted into the Labour     Party will be a more historic day still,  working     class unity in action against capitalism, will than,     end only than, begin to be a complete fact.  This,     irrespective of any preliminary internal differences     as to direction in moments of crisis.  As I have     said, the process may be somewhat painful and slow,     but it is sure.&quot;     On December 21st, when sending a copy of Mr. Wake&apos;sletter to a provincial member of the Communist party Executive,McManus wrote on behalf of the Political Bureau:  &quot;\          &quot;I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letterfrom the Executive Committee of the Labour Party on theposition of applications for membership in that body.          &quot;Upon the receipt of this commitnication, Ihave to instruct all available members in vour local totake steps as soon as possible to secure membership of the Labour Party in the individual section.          &quot;I would strongly counsel that this be done without sny display of ostention.  Members should applygradually in ones and twos, and avoid giving the localany reason to get unduly excited about it*          &quot;I take it that the local Party Committee willmake itself responsible for seeing to it that withinthe next month or two all their available members have joined the Labour Party and I expect a report from you aBto progress being made in this direction.&quot;
style party conference and to bring the procedure mor$&quot;into line with modern requirement s9  The discussions atthose conferences were restricted to a cut and driedagenda made up almost exclusively of resolutions sentin by the Branches weeJ.cs beforehand that wereconsequently more or less out of date when the conferencetools place-,     &quot;The comrades attending the conferences were generally committed in advance t$ support or oppose this, that or the other resolution,. without any freedom to exercise their own judgment on the arguments orreasons advances in the discussions *     &quot;The conferences were therefore to little or no extent conferences in the real sense of the word, andthe decisions reached might have been secured by meansof correspondence without the expenditure of time, money and thought that the conferences entailed.     &quot;The conference to be held at Manchester at the endof next month.will it is hoped mark a definite advance on these old and unsatisfactory methods - It isproposed that the conference shall be summoned on a preliminary agenda (a copy of which is enclosed herewith)oompiled by the Central Sxeosatlva Committee and embracingthe various important subjects to which it is considered desirable the attention of the conference shall be devoted.  All local party organisations sendingrepresentatives to the conference will be entitled tosend in additional items for the agenda as. well as suggested amendments to the Statutes and Rules.  such additional items and amendments will be referred to theorganising and political commissions to be appointed bythe conference which will determine with the approval ofthe conference the additional matters to be placed on theagenda,     &quot;The resolutions to be voted upon by the conference will arise out of the discussions on the differentsubjects and will be drafted by commissions speciallyappointed by the conference for that purpose..     &quot;The Central Executive Committee has also adopted the following general regulations governing theconferencoj(1)  Representation at the conference will be from     looal party organisation on the basis of one     representative for the 1st 25 members with a further     representative for each additional full complement     of 25 members.      *(2)  A small looal party organisation unable to send a     representative of its own to the conference may     combine with one or more other local party     organisations for the purpose of appointing a common     representative.(3)  Each local party organisation must be financially     responsible for the railway fare and accommodation     of its representative to the conference.  The present     financial position of the party will not permit of     any payments from central funds.   Ho pooling     arrangements will be instituted in connection with     the conference. as such arrangements in the past     have invariably resulted in heavy charges on the     Central Party funds,                          (4)/
     (4)  Ho local party organisation will be entitled to          the representation&apos;at the conference whose ;          dues to headquarters have not  been paid in          full to the end of November.     (5)  All representatives to the conference must be          full party members of at least 12 months1          standing.     (6)  Additional matters for the egenda and suggested          amendments to the Statutes and Rules must  be          sent in to the Party Secretary at headquarters          16, King Street, Covent Garden, London, W*C.2.          by not. later than Saturday, January ISth,  1924.          &quot;All local party organisations are urged to     proceed to the selection of the best available     comrades to act as representatives to the conference     and to make the financial provision required to     cover the necessary expenses.&quot;The preliminary agenda is as follows:    &quot;1.   Election of Chairman     2,   Chairman&apos;s opening address.     3.   Emergency resolutions.     4.   Reception of fraternal Delegates,,     5.   Organising Report of Central Committee.     6.

Election of Officers  (Including Central               Committee, Party Council and Control               Commission.)    .12,   Chairman&apos;s closing remarks,&quot;     In the  issue  of &quot;The Workers&quot; Weekly&quot;, dated December28th,  1923,  Tom Bell makes some interestjngfoommentson the &quot;Issues of  the conference&quot; from which the. followingextracts  are  taken:          &quot;The first.thing we must get clearly in our     minds  is  that 1924 is not 1917, nor even 1920  (the     year when our party was born) when  as yet the     revolutionary temjDO throughout Europe was still     high.    Capitalism we see still  firmly entrenched.,     still  able to attaek the living  conditions  of the     workers  and to defeat the labour organisations.   And                                                  this/
 this  applies  to  the whole  of Europe, America,  ana elsewhere,  and not merely  the  British Empire. Unlike  the  walls of Jericho, the  structure  of capitalism  needs more  than the blowing  of trumpets to raze it  to the ground,  and  we  must frankly face  the  facts.      &quot;On  the  other hand  we have only succeeded so far in  enrolling a few thousands  in our party. Perhaps it  is true to  say  we have more  active sympathisers  with our  aims outside our  ranks than inside,  and these not  merely a platonio type,  but real  active workerso   I believe the influence  of our? Party is  as  important  as our  numerical  strength. It must not be minimised.   It  is  a phenomenon  that transcends  the machinery or the personnel of organisation. What we must do is learn to  use that influence where  we are not able to recruit  it  to our Party ranks.      &quot;Reflecting on these  two  points we see how correct was the  slogan of  the  Third Congress of the Comintern -  Go to  the  masses  - and  also how apt and timely  was the tactic  of the  United pront..,      &quot;As  to our  work amongst the  trade  unions  we have  to face  the faot  that these  organisations are Btill largely in the hands of  ^afe1 leaders..   As a  Party we  are numerically too weak to  challenge the personnel of  the trade unions. But we  have our influence.  Apart from the membership generally,-amongst  commltteemen and organisers, both locally and nationally there are many  people who pride themselves  on &quot;running  with the left wing,1   we have  to harness  this &quot;left1 element and swing  it on to the floor  of the  Trades  Congress  and  make the General Council  a real  fighting body.   Already it was shown at  Plymouth we have  made a  beginning.  How to develop this  work is one of the big questions  we must  tacklo at our conference.      &quot;Reoent  events have brought  a stage further on our  relations to the  labour party.   The  Edinburgh clauses are now  gone,  thank3^to our work from  below, and in  some parliamentary  constituencies we are in a  position of political equals.  These things have  all  a  bearing upon our claims for  affiliation to the labour  Party,  But  the possibility  of affiliation raises  the  question of  Cop. identity, and its probable  absorption   The  conference must speak.its mind  on this  matter in no  uncertain manner.      &quot;On  the  other hand  as the Bab our Party approaches  the assumption  of the  powers of  government, opposittonal  elements  are  being developed ana  the lines sharpened  with the Party.   Our atbltuds  towards the labour&quot;Party policy  as a whole,  having  in  mind this  opposition,  calls  for our serious  attention.      &quot;Finally, there is  our Party programme as well as the  programme  of the  communist International calling for discussion and party  clarity, especially in relation to the question of the colonies...&quot;According/
     According to the issue of &quot;The Daily Herald.&quot; dated1.1.24. delegates from foreign countries are expected tohe present at the conference.     The arrangements are in the hands of James Crossley,Party organiser of the Manchester area, who has been sent 10 from headquarters for initial expanses,     It. is reported from a source which is usuallyaccurate that the decision to hold the conference inSalford is a result of agitation by Lancashire and Yorkshirebranches which intend, if possible, to secure the election of local communists to positions on the Executive.     The decision to make branches responsible for theirdelegates&apos; expanses has caused considerable protest and itis thought, in some quarters, that there may be a repetition of the &quot;proxy delegate&quot; arrangement with a resulting&quot;packed&quot; conference.     Harry Pollitt has suggested to the Executive Committeethat a special women&apos;s.Conference should be held at thesame time as the national Conference as he has found, whenvisiting districts, that, although &quot;great activity&quot; isbeing displayed by women comrades,there is &quot;great weakness&quot;in the &quot;lack of co-ordination&quot; between groups.     In his &quot;lotos of the Month&quot;s in the January issue of&quot;The Labour Monthly&quot;&quot; the editor, R. Palme Dirtt,  who isalso editor of &quot;The workers&apos; Weekly&quot;,  disousses to what extent a Labour Government could realise communist ideals:he comes to the conclusion that:          &quot;leither taxation, nor the capital levy, nor a     loan cen solve the problem - the  fundamental problem,&apos;     which faces a Labour Government.   Vile believe that the     plain facts of the case show,  and will increasingly     show to all the movement,  that there is only one thing     to be done - and that is to establish control of the     banks and banking credit.   Either the Government must   .  control the banks or the banks will control the     Government.   A Labour Government which has to case                                                    begging/
     begging to its enemies,  the great financial interests.     for permission to carry  out its schemes son their     terms is a pathetic spectacle.  Which in that c-aee     is the real Government of the country - the labour     Cabinet on its knees or the banks with the whip     in their hand.  A labour Government must bo a real     Government or nothing, the unquestioned sovereign     authority in the land.  The credit is there,  waiting     to be used and needing to be used for the great     productive and social purposes into which a labour     Government would wish to direct it.  All that is     needed is the determination of the labour Government     and the working class behind them that it shall be so     used and no monopoly interests shall be allowed to     stand in the way.  The same applies, and will be found     increasingly with every piece of experience to apply,     to every field of industry.  Not bargaining with the     capitalist interests, not hole-and-corner schemes of     a canal here and a bridge there by gracious permission     of the capitalist rulers while leaving them in     unchallenged possession of the great monopolist     industries they are unable to ran, but State control     of all the great industries of the country by a labour     Government with the full backing&apos; of the working class     through every pit and factory - that is the only     weapon to deal with the  present economic situation     of the countryu&quot;     District Party Committees have been instructed by thePolitical Bureau to furnish,  as so*on as possible,  a listof suitable Communist party candidates who would beavailable for nomination in the event of another generalelection.     An informant, who was recently in conversation withHarry pollitt, states that the latter, discussing theattitude of the Soviet Government towards trade said:          &quot;They must trade with other countries.  By     that I mean*they must enlarge and expand.  If we     can get trading relations with different countries     we can set up business houses... and when the business     houses come along,  there is the. base for propaganda.     you will find that some  of these places will be     staffed by men who know how to organise, who. know     how to move things, and  as you probably know, a good     deal of movement can be  made under the guise of     business.&quot;     The Belgian Communist party has invited the Britishparty to send a speaker to an international &quot;Hands OffGermany&quot; meeting which is to be held in Brussels in themiddle of this month.     J.T. Walton Newbold has informed the Scottishorganiser that:                                        &quot;l/

Among the 20     delegates prosent were A. Horner (chair),  T. Thomas,     George Dolling and A.J. Oook.          The oonforence reiterated its previous decision  that     the terms of any future agreement should be based  upon tho     oost of living,  and also again expressed its opposition to     any agreements being formulated which contained a     &quot;pernicious clause&quot; relative to profit sharing and  district     ascertainments as a factor governing the rates of wages     payable to colliery workers.          In view of the possibility of a crisis developing as     a result of the recent decision that the possibilities of     strike action being taken as a means of improving  the     standard of life of the miners, it  was daoided to urge     the official body to inaugurate machinery  for  the purpose     of presenting our case as effectively us  possible1 to     other organisations, suoh as the  National  Union of     Railwayman,  the Transport workers&apos;  Union,  etc.,  so  that  the                                                        workers/

It is stated in the confidential minutes of a meetingof the Glasgow District Council of the Bed International oflabour Unions, held at the end of December, that:          &quot;Comrade Campbell opened up a discussion on the     future activities of the-R.I.L.U.   He pointed out.     that in ell situations where a crisis developed in     the industrial field it was customary for the British     Bureau of the R.I.L.U.; to-issue- an appeal, demanding     that the General Council of the Trades Union congress.  . . .oall an-All-In Conference to Ieal with same.  . This was     now losing its effect and in the case of the present     crisis in the mining, railway end transport industries,     he suggested that the best plan would be for the R.I.L.U.     to initiate an agitation in the respective Unions     oatering for these industries for a united policy and     united action.  Thero was,:.considerable -discussion on this     matter and ultimately on the motion of Comrade Park,     A.E.U., Lfieconded.by\.Comrade Leslie, iI.TJ.R. it was agreed     to write the British Bureau urging this plan for&apos;     adoption in the present crisis- . It was also decided to  ,     get the policy of the R.I.L.U. definitely stated on     the position in the&apos;Fife coalfield where there are two     Unions in existence catering for miners.&quot;     George Hardy^ who has for some time played a leading part in Red International of Labour Unions propaganda amongseamen, has arrived in this country from the Continent.     The position in Germany appears to have disorganisedthe work of the Red International of Labour Unions, at leasttemporarily:  the &quot;International propaganda committee of clerical Employees&quot; has informed the communist Party of GreatBritain that the international conference of the &quot;revolutionaryunions and minorities of clerical employees&quot; has boon                                             indefinitely/
THE YOUNG COMMUNIST  LEAGUE                               .          The  Young  Communist League  of Great Britain has been     informed  by the Executive Committee of the  &quot;Red Sportintern&quot;     that it must participate in a campaign on behalf of  the     German workers:  in the  course of a secret  circular  the     League is informed  that:               &quot;The  International  Aid  for the German proletariat          through workers: organisations including workers1  sport          leagues consists of:                   (1)   Material  help                   (2)   Political support,               &quot;Concrete proposals for Red sportintern Sections&apos;          aid  are as follows:      v.\   (1)   Collections on behalf of the struggling and               starring  German workers,  organisation of sport               and gymnastic  displays,  sale of literature, post-               cards,  eto,, the proceeds to be used  on behalf  of               the starving German proletariat,          (2)   To initiate a  political campaign  on a large scale               for the support of the  German revolution.     This               campaign  is to take the form of agitation  and               anti-militarist propaganda among  the  working               masses  interested  in sports and gymnastics, and  is               to be in  harmony with the work done by the  C.P.               and the Y.0cl. in  that  direction.     The sections               of the  Red Sportintern  should pay special               attention to anti-militarist propaganda, for  the               bourgeoisie uses as a rule its sport  organisations               in the  service of  militarism.   Thus  it is               incumbant on the proletarian sport Leagues  to               bring back into  their ranks  the proletarian sport               Leagues which  have  succumbed to bourgeois  sport               organisations&apos; influence,  and  to  at least neutralise               the semi-proletarian soctions of  the  population.&quot;          H.

     the  organised unemployed when Parliament is sitting:  they     appear,  however,  to he short of money and are appealing to     cesrtein trade union branches for support.          It is reported on the authority of a single informant     that the National Unemployed workers&apos; Committee Movement     is considering the possibility of arranging a series of     hunger marches in varidus parts of the country and  that the     Council is particularly anxious to obtain money for this     purpose.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES III GREAT BRITAIN         Irish extremists in this country have been particularly     quiet during the  Christmas holidays.  No meetings of     importance have been held and  the few social gatherings    . were not well attended.          A new feature of the Republican journal &quot;Eire&quot;,    &quot;published in Manchester, is a column headed &quot;Agitation in     India&quot; giving particulars of the revolutionary movement in     that country.          The Republican propaganda Department is making as much     as possible out of the question raised by Captain Redmond in     An Bail  with regard to the status of the King as Commander-     in-chief of the Free State Army.          In Liverpool an attempt is being made to organise     the  district and  establish new clnbsc  Mai achy Quin of     Newry has been sent over specially to rouse the rank and     file of Sinn Fein.   The local Irish Republican Army are     quarrelling amongst themselves, a very usual state  of affairs.     At a recent meeting held at 93e Scotland Road,  at which Peter     Murphy presided,  it was resolved that Daly (o/C,  Liverpool),     was  not  giving satisfaction and that Headquarters be asked     to remove him and appoint another  o/Cs    Vincent Hughes of                                                      Dundalk/

In Scotland much the seme state of affairs exists:  theNational Exeoutive Council of Republican Clubs  is arranging tocircularise all Scottish Labour M.Ps. giving a  statement ofthe Irish situation, pointing out  the responsibility ofEngland and requesting that they take up the question of having the threat of war withdrawn.     The majority of the Scottish  Eepubliean prisonersreleased by the pree State are baok at their homes andmany, of them are rejoining the looal Irish republican army:  It is also reported that quite a number ofdemobilised Free State soldiers are joining the Eepublicenolubse     Slane, the local Irish Republican Army Commander, is out of favour with most of his offioers and many of themrefuse to work with him;  only &quot;B&quot; oompany are  obeying his orders.     Many of the returned Free State soldiers are joiningup also with the Irish Republican  Brotherhood, whichmovement appears^ to be recovering  some of its old timeimportance.    A local correspondent says &quot;there are rowsin plenty, and all are eager for a share in the spoils&quot;.The main1 fight will be between the Irish Republican Armyand the Irish Republican Brotherhood for control.
