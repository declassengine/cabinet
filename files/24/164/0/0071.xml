R DOCUIENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC KAJDSTTS&apos; GOVHRfeENT.. 6&apos;P&apos;&quot;&apos;T. 70  ( 24). &apos;               CABINET              MSMORAND&apos;Lli BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND,Reorganisation of Offices (Scotland) Bill..            This Bill proposes to affect a number of alterations   in the constitution &quot;of Scottish Departments,  The main pro-   posals are as follows:-       Clause[1.  This  is to substitute a parliamentary Under   SecretaTrysnin-for Scotland for the existing Office or   Parliamentary Under Secretary for Health.  Experience has shown   that it  is desirable  that the parliamentary Under Secretary   should not be restricted to dealing with questions of health   but should be available for general duties.       Clause 2.  This  provides for a reduction in the number   of members of the Scottish Board of Health to three on the   occurrence of vacancies.  An amendment of the law is required   to effect this reduction because Section 3 (2) of the Scottish   Board of health Act,  1919, requires that the Board shall always   include two registered Medical Practitioners, a woman and an   Advocate or Law Agent of 10 years&apos; standing.  Accordingly the   Board must contain under  that. Section at least four members.   At present there are  four members of whom one is a Doctor,   one a woman.and one an Advocate.  The Clause provides for   reduction to three members and for repeal of the requirement   that two members must be Doctors, one a  woman and one an   Advocate or Law Agent.       Clause 5.  This  provides that the Chairman of the Fishery   Board for Scotland shall hold his Office&apos; with the ordinary   Civil Service tenure.  At present under Section 4 of the Act   of .1895 the Chairman  is appointed ,for a period of 5 years.   This is unsatisfactory when, as on the last occasion,  the   fittest person for the appointment was a Civil Servant, namely,   the Secretary to the  Board.  In order to enable him to hpld   the Chairmanship, without sacrifice of his Civil Service   tenure, he has been continued in the Office of Secretary.   This meets the situation temporarily but it is desirable to   put the matter on a better footing by giving the Chairman   the ordinary Civil Service tenure.       Clause 4.  The Office of Deputy Clerk Register has b^en   vacant since the death of the last holder,  Sir James Patten   Macdougall, in 1919.  The Deputy Clerk Register performed   alse the duties of Registrar General.  An Act passed in 1920   made the Registrar Generalship a separate Office.  During the   passage  of that Act the Secretary for Scotland stated that, it   was not proposed to fill tho Office of Deputy Clerk Register.   This Clause&apos; provides  for abolition of that Office.       QllQg  &amp;JL* iL PPiL   *   These are consequential on Clause 4,   The Deputy&quot;&apos;Clerk&quot;lTcgisTer exercised control&quot; over the ReoprdOffice/

Clause 6 is also consequential on the abolition of theOffice&apos; of Deputy Clork Register,  That officer was empoweredto act in the place of tho Lord Clerk Register at the Elocutionof Peers if the Lord Clerk Register were unavailable,  ThisClause authorises the Principal Clerk of Session to act assubstitute for tne Lord Clerk Register in that event,     Clause 9.   This gives power to appoint tho same person to hold the Offices of Keeper of the Records,  Keeper of Sasinesand Keepog&quot; of Deeds or any two of them.  The po?/er is to boexercised by the Seoretary for Scotland after consultation withthe Lord president of the court  of Session, the Lord Advocateand the Lord Justice Clerk.        Power is also given.to the Secretary for Scotland,after similar consultation, to discontinue the existing Officeof. Direotor of Chancery and to distribute his duties among other officers.
