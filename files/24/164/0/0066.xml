fooCDIffiST  IS TEE PROPERTY OE HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTY5S  GOVERNMENT,65 (24)              CABINETPOOR LAW EMERGENCY PROVISIONS COM&apos;I1TUANCE            (SCOTWD) BILL.]JELrOIDiNDUM. BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.           I  circulate  for  the  infeitnatj.cn of my  oolleague3 copy ?f the draft cf a Bill whioh  is urgently  required in connectiont;wit.n the administration  of Poor Law  in Sectland.          Prior to 1981  poor relief  in Scot! and wa3  not  available to able-bsdied persons reference though destitute.  In view of the &quot; very considerable amount cf destitution due  to unemployment then prevalent, parish councils, who administer poor relief,  were&apos; instructed to provide relief to destitute able-bodied persons cut of employment, and tho statutory position v-hs regularised by the Poor Law Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act,  1921.    ThatAct, which was only a temporary provision, would  have expired on 15th May, 1923, but was continued in operation, subject to certain amendments, for  another year&apos; (that is until  15th May, 1924) by Section 3 of the  Local authorities  (Emergency Provisions)Act, 3933.          Unless,, therefore, legislation  is  obtained before 15thMay next the po-er of poor 3rw authorities in Scotland to provide&apos;relief to the able-bodied  will lapse..          As my colleagues are a^are the  position in regard to unemployment is still sufficiently serious to render necessary the continuance of the Act of 1321 although  it  is  right  to mention that the expenditures for the  current year  frcm 15th Kay, 1923, is less than for the previous  year.    The expenditure from 15th Kay, 1923, to 313t  December last on  poor relief to  the able-bodied amounted in all to.  about  010,000,  a  figure which indicates the necessity  for the continuance  of the present powersof parish councils.the          The proposal of the present Bill is to continuepowei of parish councils, to relieve destitute able-bodiedpersons out Of employment for another year until 3 5th May, 1925.The whole question of poor relief by parish councils may requirereconsideration,  but time does net permit of this matter beinggone into and dealt v?ith hy legislation before Kay next.          The Bill makes two amendnenta on the present position..The first relates to a power conferred by the act of 1923 onpsvri3h councils to arrange for. the employment by a local   *authority, on direct labour of persons who would otherwise havebeen in recoipt of relief, and for the parish council to payover to the local authority the sum which would otherwise have                                                  !         beenfife Sees3L3? r??!!siititaiiiH
 been provided for relief..  Tho-restriction  of  the power to cases Tfhere the nan was employed on direct labour under the- local authority has prevented the Section being taken advantage of in a great many cases.-&apos;  Local  authorities, in carrying out works of public utility generally  place them under contract.  Arrangements can be made whereby the contractor will employ the person who would  otherwise be relieved by the parish council and for the parish council to pay over to the local authority the sum which would other- wise have been provided&apos;in relief,.   This power has been asked for by a considerable nunber of the mo3t  important of the parish councils.  .                          .,          The second amendment&apos; confers pewer on parish councils to assi3t destitute able-bodied persons- to emigratewhere they.&quot;have&quot;expressed a desire to emigrate..  This is a power which poor law authorities have in England and it hasbeen, asked.; for by parish councils in Scotland.                          *m.
