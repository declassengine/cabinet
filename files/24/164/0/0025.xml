DOCUMENT IS THE property OF..HIS BRITANNIC KAJESTY&apos;:S GOVERNMENT.     With reference to tho Lord Chancellor&apos;s memorandum cp. 460(23), I desire to submit ttoo following observationsfor tho consideration of ray colleague a: -     1.  In a letter dated the 22nd January, 1920 fromthe Law Society to the Lord Chancellor that Society drew attention to the fact that two barristers had beenappointed as Solicitor and Assistant Solicitor to this ministry.   They protested against barristers being appointed to Government Solicitorships instead of solicitorsand stated that the Public Offices at the disposal of the bar were of &quot;vastly greater proportion in importance andvalue&quot; than those at the disposal of solicitors.     2.  The then Lord Chancellor in his reply&apos; of the27th January, 1920 pointed out the wide scope of duties to be performed by Solicitors to Public Offices, but he expressed sympathy with the representations of the society and suggested a differentiation of legal duties and legaloffioers, namely, a barrister (to be termed &quot;legal adviser&quot;)to perform duties properly attributable to a barrister,anda Solicitor (presumably to be so designated) to perform the duties properly attributable to a Solicitor.  Copiesof theBe letters were seat by the Lord Chanoellor *sir Robert Home (who was then Minister of Labottr) on the27th January, 1920, and in a reply dated the 24th February,1920,  Sir Robert stated that the correspondence had beensent by him to the Treasury since the point at Issue wasMEMORANDUM BY MINISTER OP LABOURCRET.SOLICITORSHIPS TO GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.
one which did not concern the Ministry of Labourexclusively, but affected the legal departments of theCivil Service generally.     3,  On the 29th October, 1923,, the Law  Society  againraised the matter in a letter to myself with reference  tothe appointment of a barrister as  Solicitor  to this ministry, asking that subh appointments should be reservedfor Solicitors and that in future  vacancies  should be notified to the Society.  On the same date,  the Societywrote to the Prime Minister with reference to the appoint-ment of a Barrister to the post of Treasury  Solicitor.     4&apos;.&quot;&quot; Y/lth regard to the Treasury Solicitor the reply of the Prime Minister of the 9th November, 1923,  statedthat the Prime Minister&apos;s only object was to select  theperson best qualified for the postj in addition the  dutiesdevolving upon the Treasury Solicitor were, referred  to, as also was the fact that the title &apos;Solicitor&apos; was probablymisleading.  My reply of the 22nd  November,1923, also called.attention to the misconception of  the duties of the  Solicitorto this Ministry and the misleading title of Solicitor1.     5.  In the meantime, on the 2nd November, 1925, the law society raised the same matter in  a letter written to theLord Chancellor.  The reply of the Lord Chancellor of the9th November expressed general agreement with the views setout in tho letter from Lord Birkenhead of the 27th January,1920.     6.  As other departments are  concerned, my predecessorreferred the matter in 1920 for consideration to v-*Treasury as the Department exercising gener.over all Government Departments.   Ho decide,-, -vwever,appears to have been come to and under these circumstances and in view of the recent correspondence I am circulatingthiB memorandum to my colleagues.  &apos;        1 can personally deal only with the  Legal Department of
tne Ministry ox Labour, but the considerations affectingthe issue in thia Department would I believe be found toapply to many other Ministries.7.    By far the greater portion of the work performed bythe Legal Department of thia Ministry is more properlyattributable to a barrister than to a solicitor, nameiy:-advising on questions of law (many of them of veryconsiderable difficulty), drafting, advising upon questions on whioh I am required to adjudicate under a.10 of theUnemployment Insurance Act, 1920, conducting in court alarge number of proseoutions for summary offences, eto;but there is also a very considerable&apos;amount of importantwork which is properly performed by solicitors,  suoh a3 theissuing and service of writs and conduct of litigation, thepreparation of briefs to Counsel, the taking of proofs of witnesses and collection of debts etc.    &apos;i&apos;here are in theLegal Department of .this Ministry 14 barristers and 3solicitors,, and the members of the respective branches ofthe Legal Profession are occupied practically entirely uponthe work of their respective branches of the profession.8.    It ia obvious from the letters already referred tothat a certain amount of misapprehension has arisen fromtne use of the expressions &quot;Solicitor&quot;  and &quot;AssistantSolicitor1.   As will be seen from what I have set out above, that part of the work of the Legal Department ofthis Ministry which is properly solicitor&quot;s work represents(though it is considerable in volume) but a small propor-*tion of the whole of the work of that Department,  and itmight tend to remove the existing misunderstanding if the
suggestion as to a change of nomenclature contained in theLord Chancellor&apos;s letter of the 27th Jenuary, 1920, were adopted at least to some extents9.    It must be borne in mind that it is essential thatthere should be*a &quot;Solicitor&quot;, eo nomine,, to the Ministryof labour because only a person so designated is entitledto act in the litigation of the Ministry as the Minisbry&apos;sSolicitor without being subject to penalties under theSolicitors&apos;  Asts0      Subject to this reservation, I would suggest that theHe8d of the  Legal Department cf this Ministry (who, fromthe fact3 already stated, should be a barrister) should be termed &quot;Legal Secretary&apos;.   This title indeed already exists in the Lord Advocate&apos;s Department of the Scottish Office,,10.   The term &quot;Legal idviser&quot; is not in my view appropriateas the designation of the Head of a Legal Department whichconducts the whole of its legal business without referenceto the Treasury Solicitor, for the name &quot;Legal Adviser&apos; has,by long custom, come to be regarded as the designation ofthe official appointed for the purpose of giving legal advice in those Government Departments which refer their  solicitorsbusiness to  the Treasury Solicitor.11..   In this Ministry the Head of-the Legal Department isat present called &quot;the Solicitor&quot;r.   Immediately subordinateto him there are two Assistant Solicitors,  of whom one - abarrister - is in charge of the work performed by thebarristers in the office;  the other - a solicitor - is incharge of the work performed by the solicitors in the Depart-menta      I see no reason why the last mentioned AssistantSolicitor should not be designated &quot;the Solicitorto the Ministry&quot; while remaining in his
present position as subordinate to the Head of thelegal Department who would be called &quot;Legal Secretary&apos;,- an appropriate change being simultaneously made Inthe designation of the Assistant Solicitor at presentin charge of the work performed by the barristers Inthe.  Office.     12. . Tho passage in the law SocietyTs letter ofthe&apos;22ni January, 1920, which suggests that the 3fordChanoellor &apos;is aware of the vastly greater proportionin Importance and value of the Public Offices at thedisposal of the Bar than at the disposal of solicitors&apos;is probably open to considerable question, moreespecially in the light of the observations made above.I am not, however, myself in a position to express an opinion upon this.     13.  I would suggest, however,  that tho time hasnow come for tho Treasury to decide, in consultationwith the several Departments, upon a change in theexisting designation of the Heads of Segal departments in the various Ministries, so that the misconceptionswhich at present exist in regard to  the nature ofthe principal legal posts in the Civil Service may beremoved.  It should, however, in my  opinion, be clearly understood that the Government will not agrsoto  the Law Society&apos;s request that they should be consulted whenever-vacancies in these particular postso ccur.                              (Intd.) M.B.Ministry of  Labour, January 16th, 1924.
