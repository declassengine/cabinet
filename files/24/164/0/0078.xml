     DOOthGITT. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.CP.  77  (24)                                                      p f\ i&apos;-&apos;                                                      OU j                      CABINET.                (Home  Affairs  Committee.)            -.  1 5                                                      /  $             WAR CHARGES  (VALIDITY)  BILL;.        Memorandum by the President  of  the  Board of Trade.     This Bill  is of  considerable urgency,  and  it is thoughtthat there is good reason for introducing it and proceeding with it as soon as possible *  The measure is one for making valid certain  charges and levies imposed by theGovernment during the late war.  The legality of one kindof levy was tested in the Courts, and the House of Lordsdecided judicially against the Crown in June, 1922;  andthe result is that if the Crown&apos;s action in collectingthese charges and levies is not validated by a  specialmeasure, claims for repayment may be made which may aggregate 18,000,000, and possibly more;     During the war various Government Departments,  in orderto prevent traders from making undue profits by reason ofwar conditions, and also in order to provide for the regulation of control of various commodities, adopted thepractice of exacting payments from traders  in considerationof the grant to such traders as desired to  avail  themselves of them, of special privileges and facilities whiohgenerally, but not invariably, took the form of licencesby tho Departments.  Particulars of the cases, in whichthese various payments were made will bo found  in  theAnnexe.  As regards the special case in which the  House  ofLords decided judicially against the Crowrj*  &apos; (which is described in detail in the Annex, Par, l) namely,  that inrespect of the  licences imposed upon milk exporters  in theSouth West of England, it was stated by the then Governmentin the House of Commons in advance,  (i.e. in March,  1922)that if the appeal to tlie House of Lords went against the                      -1-
Grown, the Government would bring in a Bill to legalisetheir procedure in cases of this nature during the periodof control.     The question referred to was put in  the House ofCommons on 9th liar oh, and was as follows:-     ISl. GODFREY LOCKER-LAHPSON:-          To ask the President of the Board of Trade       whether ho proposes to take any further action       with regard to tho case in which the Court of       Appeal has given&apos; Judgment against  the Crown in       proceedings to recover certain monies claimed       to be due from the Wilts United Dairies Limited.     And this answer was given by LIr, Baldwin, the thenPresident of the Board:-          In the case to which my hon. Friend refers      - the decision of the Court of first instance was       to the effect that the Crown is entitled to       recover certain monies claimed to be due from the       Wilts United Dairies, Limited in respect of       charges made by the. ilinistry of Food on licences       to export milk from one area to another.  This       decision has been reversed by the Court of Appeal       and an appeal to the House of Lords has been       lodged.  If judgment be given by the House of       Lords against the Crown, the Government will bring       in a bill to legalise their procedure in cases of .       this nature during the period of control,     (This answer seems to contemplate a Bill for thelegalisation of all the levies, without making an exceptionin this particular milk case or any other instance of the milk levy).     The House of Lords, as stated above, found against theCrown in the Wilts United-Dairy Case at the end of June, 1922,and on 19th July, 1022, occurred the only debate  on thematter which has taken place in Parliament.  It was in the lords on a motion by Lord Strachie that the Governmentshould re-imburse all persons !lwho have been compelled topay the illegal tax of  2d. a gallon as a condition of a licence to sell outside the South-West Counties,  milkproduced in those counties&quot;.  Lord Strachie then spoke aboutfees &quot;taken out of the pockets of the farmers&quot;.
     But LordBuckmaeter, who had sat as Speaker.when theWilts case same before the Lords, pointed out that it wasnot the price of the milk obtained by the farmer, but thatobtained by the middle-man, whioh was in question.  He hadto pronounce the&apos; fees as illegal in his capacity of speaker of the Lords as a judicial body; but as a member of that house as a legislative chamber he waB strongly againstthe demand for re-imbursement by the Government of the feosin question, which simply meant that the complainants- were trying to back out of a bargain by an appeal to an accidentallegal difficulty.  Lord birkenhead, then Lord Chancellor,followed to the same effect, and the House of Lords defeatedthe motion by 42 votes to 29.     The Government&apos;a War Charges (Validity) Bill was introduced in the House of Commons about ten days later(1st August, 1932) but, while proposing to legalise all &quot;the,other levies, it excepted levies in respect of feeB for the.milk licences.     This waB indicated in the reply given to a question-on,the 2nd August by the then Minister of Agriculture, SirA. Griffith Boocawen.  He said -          &quot;The Government propose to accept the judicial     decision of the House of Lords as regards the licence     fee of 2d. per gallon imposed on milk distributors of     the four south-western counties.  The oharges levied     under the milk Order are accordingly&apos;excepted from the     operation of the War Charges (Validity) Bill, and     repayment will be made as soon as the assent of     Parliament is received to this proposal&quot;.     The Government are understood to have considered that since the House of Lords, as a judicial body, had decided against them, it would be preferable to make this exemptionin the case of milk.  At that time the Milk Charges stoodalone so far as regards a judicial decision against theGovernment, and there was consequently a reason why theGovernment should make a special exemption in favour of thatdecision.  Now, as will presently appear, judgment has been
                                                         iS8given against the Government in a shipping case, also, sothat there iB less reason for discrimination in favour of aparticular class of middlemen.  Actually, however,, the bill was drawn in general terms, designed to validate all charges -other than the Milk Charges,- which might be regarded asfalling within the scope of the &quot;Wilts United Dairies&quot; judgment:it contained no Schedule specifioally enumerating these charges.     The Bill made no progress, as Parliament rose a few daysafterwards, and it was not introduced again until March,  1923.It was then in substance the same as before, and again made no progress - partly because of congestion of parliamentary business.  The Bill was to have been proceeded with In thesitting last Autumn, and as a result of preparatory considera-tion by the Board of Trade it was decided, at the instance ofthe Federation cf British Industries, to set out in a schedulethe charges which the Bill was intended to oov-er.-  The MilkCharges have now been included, since there appears to be no practical justification for favouring the milk licensees overand above the llcencees in respect, of&quot;the other articles?moreover, as was pointed out by Lord Birkenhead In the debateabove referred to, the effect of the decision, unless modified,would be that distributors and cheese manufacturers In theSouth-West of England would obtain a profit considerably inexcess of that earned by their less fortunate competitors inother parts of the country.     The amount of the repayments for Milk licences is  105,000.This sum is held in a suspense account pending the decisionof the House of Commons in the matter.     It must be  added that the Crown has recently loBt a casein the High Court which was brought against them, by Messrs.Brocklebank for recovery of the payment of  35,000 required from them by the Shipping Controller in respect of the  transfer to a foreign flag of one of their ships.  Notice of appeal hasbeen given on the part of tho  Crown.,  and meanwhile other  similar
actions have not been proceeded, with.  As, however, the .decision would probably be against the Crown eventually, bothin the Broeklebank case and in the numerous others that arepending following the judgment of the House of Lords in theWilts United Dairies case, it is desirable to have the bill passed before the pending cases make further progress. Itshould be mentioned that the pending cases are not concernedwith ship transfers alone., but also with licences to brewadditional beer (Annex, Paragraph 4) and levies made inconnection with the control of Hides (Annox,  Paragraph 6)-,     A strong argument in favour of such legislation is thaton faith of the then Government&apos;s announcement in March, 1922,above referred to, that such a Bill would be introduced ifthe test case went against the Government., there must havebeen many licencees who refrained from instituting any legal proceedings against the Departments conoemed,  And now - ifthe Indemnity Act, 1920? applies to this extent - they are too late to take any action, for the latest date for institutingproceedings under that Act is 31st. August, 1922.  Consequentlythose people who trusted the then Government will be in aworse position than those who, in spite of the ministerialstatement, instituted proceedings before the date in question.The people who are thus out of time would surely raise aclamour for repayment&quot; on grounds of equityj/and If their demands were acceded to, the possible grand  total ofGovernment disbursements would amount to approximately 18,000,000.     Some lioencees, however, have entered claims againstthe Government after the 31st AugUBt, 1922 - apparently tosafeguard their position as far aB possible.   There is noabsolute certainty that this provision of the Indemnity Actas&apos;to a latest date appliesi and the effect  of the Bill willpartly be to remove doubts.
     A print of the latest draft Is attached.  It is drawn jso as to validate all charges, whether specified in. theSchedule or not, which might be considered to fall withinthe scope of the judgment in the Wilts United Dairies case,including the Milk Levy which waB the actual subject oflitigation in that case.  In these respects the draft differs from the version prepared last Autumn which was designed to validate only the charges actually specified in the schedule,and also excluded the Milk Levy.                                             S.W.BOARD OP TRADE,   6th February, 1924.
                            AHBEX.                    . w&apos;4 A                 (1) MILK LI GEHCE CHARGE.     In order to ascertain the cost of the production of milk throughout Great Britain,  the Pood Controller in January,  1919,  appointed a Commission,  which recommended that different  maximum, prices should be fixed in certain parts of  tho country to correspond with the cost of production which,  in some  parts,  was lov/er than in others.     These recommendations  were  given effeot to in thd Milk (Summer Prices)  Order,  1919,  which provided that producers&apos; and  wholesalers&apos; maximum prices should,  in the South Western Area (Cornwall, Devon,  Somerset  and Dorset),  where the  cost  of  production  was lower,  be 2d.  a gallon lower, and  in the Industrial area of the  West Riding  of Yorkshire, where the cost of production  was higher,  be  2d.  a gallon higher, than the maximum price  applicable  to the rest of England and  Wales.     As a very large volume  of milk  is exported from the South Western Area to other parts  of England and Wales, unless special arrangements had been made  to meet  the situation, dealers outside the Area would have bought exported milk at rates of 2d. a gallon less than the normal, and  sold it  at rates based on the normal cost of production thus securing an unjustifiable profit of 2d. a gallon over&apos; and  above the normal.  Moreover, what is more important, the  equitable distribution of milk would have been endangered by the competition to purchase milk from the South Western Area.     To meet this difficulty, the Food Controller made Directions providing that a person should not,  except  under licence buy any milk produced in the South Western area for the purpose of any business outside  of the Area.   The -form of licence contained a Clause stating that in
consideration of the issue of tho licence, the licencesagreed to observe the conditions thereof and to pay to thePood Controller, a charge of 2d. a gallon,:     The Directions further provided that, exoept under licence, a person might not import milk from outside theIndustrial District of the West Hiding for tho purposes ofany business within that dis riot*  A Licence fee of 2d.a gallon was also charged in respect of these licences, soas to allow the producer in the Industrial District, whoseco3t of production was 2do per gallon in excess of normal,to sell his milk in the District without being prejudiced by unfair competition.     Similar arrangements were made to deal with milk products manufactured In the South Western Area from Milkproduced in that Area.     The validity of these Orders and Directions was called in question, and licencees in fact refused in someoases to pay the licence fee.     Proceedings in the nature of a test Case werecommenced by the Crown to recover from the Wilts United DairiesOompany a sum amounting to  15,027 in respect of licencefees.  Ths Grown obtained judgment in the Court of firstinstanceo  The Company, however, appealed and the Courtof Appeal reversed the decision previously obtained.  TheCrown then lodged an Appeal to the Eouse of Lords againstthe decision of the Court of Appeal, but the House ofLords decided that there was no statutory authority forits Imposition.          2. FLOUR, PRECLUDED PURPOSES,  LICENCE CHARGE!..                    WHEAT, EXPORT LICENCE Ai pHAEGjg.     Prevented State Subsidy being applied to purposes  forwhich it was not intended.    In the case of the former
e?3scheme, the licence duty was charged In respect of flourto be used for purposes other than bread.  In the oaseof the latter it was charged to prevent the Subsidy being applied to Wheat exported to the Channel Inlands or the isle of Man, and seed wheat exported to Prance andBelgium for the ravaged districts.   Sum involved in the flour licences, about seven million pounds; sum involvedin the Wheat Export Licences - twenty-seven thousandpounds.            (3) BREAD SUBSIDY REDUOTIOH SCHEMES.                      IMPORTED MEAT LEVY.    Prevented inflated profits on stocks held or in transit on the occasion of an inorease in the ControlledMaximum Price.  As regards Bread, this increase in theprioe occurred on two occasions owing to the gradual reduction, in two stages, of the. Subsidy on Flour forbread making.  Amount involved - about two hundred thousand pounds.    As to the case of Heat, the Food Controller, as theprincipal Importer of Meat, found it necessary to increasethe.controlled prices to avoid selling at a loss.  Therewere some private meat importers whose purohase costsdid not require an inorease in their selling prices, andthey agreed to remit 3d. per lb. to the Ministry, with theresult that they maintained approximately the same rate of profit on their sales.   Amount involved, about three hundred thousand pounds.                       e                 (*) BEER LIOEBOE CHARGE.    All Brewers were restricted to a fixed and equalpercentage of their pre-war output, but in some industriallocalities a demand for further supplies arose, and in order
 to meet this, licences were issued by the Pood Controller permitting the brewing of a limited number of additional barrels.  These licences had obviously to be limited in number, and the brewers who obtained them were charged at the rate of 25/- per standard barrel) the profit per barrel was considerably higher than the rate charged for the licences. Sum involved, about one million seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds.                   (5) HIDES CONTROL LEVY.    Prevented middlemen from securing excessive profits owing to the abnormal margin between the controlled buying price of home-produced hidos and the Belling price.  The controlled selling price had to be increased from time to time in conformity with the world prices whioh, after the cessation of hostilities, tended to rise considerably above the level of the home prices;at the same time5 it was impracticable to vary the controlled buying price of home-produced hides, because any variation of that price would have involved complicated adjustments of the various controlled prices charged for the different cuts of the meat.  It was, therefore, agreed with the brokers that they should pay to the Food Controller the difference between their buying and selling prices, subject to a commission. Sum involved, one million, five hundred thousand pounds.                   (6) CATTLE FEEDING STUFFS LEVY.    This related to a scheme for the distribution of cattle feeding stuffs which was administered by a purely  trade committee, the Food Controller issuing the necessary orders  and instructions for itB working.   At the termination of the  scheme there was an unexpended, balance of about  57,000  in which  theMinistry of Food specifically disclaimed any interest.  The sanction of.the Court haB been given to  use this  balance as  a special fund for charitable purposes in  the interests  of the trades concerned.
                (7) POTATOES LICENCE CHARGE.     This charge had reference to the control of prices anddistribution which was in force for a few months in 1918 and1919.  Certain grower-dealers asked to be allowed to continueusing their own channels for distribution and were permitted to do so on condition of paying their share towards thecontrol scheme, which they readily agreed to do.  Thepayments did not exceed  1,000.                         (8) COTTON.              LICENCE TO WORK EXCESS MACHINERY.     The Cotton Control Board limited the amount of machinerythat could be worked to sixty per cent, of the machinery atthe Mill.  Licences  were-, however, granted to work excessmachinery on payment of levies which were to be used for therelief of operatives temporarily discharged as a result ofthe restriction.     The whole of the money raised (three and one-thirdmillion pounds) was not required, and a Trust was constitutedwith the approval of the Court to deal with the balance (over one-million five hundred thousand pounds),              (9) PERMITS IN RESPECT OF IMPORTS.     When goods had been imported into this country, contraryto existing regulations, a fee was charged in some cases asa condition of allowing the goods to be .delivered to theimporter.  Sum involved - approximately ten thousand pounds.        (10) TRANSFER OF BRITISH SHIPS TO FOREIGN FLAGS.     During the war no British ship waB allowed to betransferred to a foreign flag without the consents of theBoard of Trade and Shipping Controller,   These consents wersonly given in exceptional cases, and generally speaking,
when the ship was fifteen years old or more; and a guaranteehad to be given to build or purchase equivalent tonnage and place it under the British flag.  In addition, the ownerwho applied for the transfer, was required to pay fifteenper oent. of the purchase price to the Exchequer.  Owing toBritish ships being subject to requisition, the value ofthe ships under allied and foreign flags was much greaterthan their value under the British flag; and it was thoughtthat the Exchequer should have some part of the monetaryadvantage obtained by the shipowner through the sale.  Suminvolved - about one million pounds0                       (11) HOP CONTROL.     Hops were controlled, and foreign imports prohibitedexcept under licences for which.a fee was charged,, .Thesefees realized about  235,000*          (12) IRON AID STEEL (MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS).     (A)  Pre-Armistloe Refund of Subsidies.     The  Steel Industry was controlled and subsidised, and prices were fixed in this country.  The export of Steel was prohibited except under licence, the fee for which was 30/..per ton, being the average difference between the home-controlled and the foreign prices, respectively.  Refunds upto the time of the Armistice totalled same  1,560,000.     (B) Post-Armistice Refund of Subsidies.     Similar arrangements after the Armistice, during short periods of continuance of the subsidies on Iron and Steelproduced about  725,000.     (C) Permits to increase. Stocks.     By Ministry of Munitions order in January, 1919,  no person was allowed to Increase his stocks beyond theamounts he held in October, 1915 j or October, 1918, (which-ever was greater), without a permit conditional on his re-funding the Government subsidy.  About  125,000 was refunded.
      (13) MINISTRY OP SHIPPING AND ADMIRALTY TOWAGE                           SERVICES.       &apos;                &apos;-    Under the Defence of the Realm Regulations (No.39),the Admiralty were empowered to prohibit by Order anyvessel, or any vessel of a specified.class, from being inany sea area which they thought it necessary to keepclear in the interests of public safety or the Defenceof the Realm.    They issued an Order under this Regulationprohibiting sailing vesselB from being in certain areasunless towed.   In certain oases when other tugs wereunavailable; provision was made for towage to be givenby the Ministry of Shipping and Admiralty vessels, andfor these towage services the Ministry of Shipping and admiralty charged fees.            (14) REFUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH LEATHER.    Matters relating to the supply of Leather during theWar period were administered by the War Office from 1917until March, 1919, when they!wero transferred to theMinistry of Munitions.       (l) There was a disparity in the value of Sole    Leather from home-grown hides released at controlled    prices and similar leather produced from imported    hides? the value of the latter was the higher, for the    reason that it included the cost of insurance and    freights both, however, were subject to the same fixed    controlled selling price.  In the case of the leather    from home-grown hides, tanners refunded to the    Government the difference between prioes whioh*were    settled in consultation with the trade as being fair    prices based on costs, on the one hand, and the    controlled selling prices on the other.  The amount    involved was  305,569.       (S) Importation of Upper and Sole Leather was                           -13-
     prohibited except under licence in February,  1917,     Leather purchased abroad before that date  was,    .however, permitted to be imported in October,  1917,     and during that interval home prices had risen     considerably.   The importers  who had.bought when  prices&quot;     were lower,  were at their own suggestion restricted     to cost + Aft profit;  any excess realized was  paid     to the Government.  These payments totalled some      33,000.        (3) After the Armistice, Rough Leather  was  allowed     to  be exported at controlled prices subject  to     certain payments to the Government -   These payments     totalled about  19,000.              (15)  GLYCERINE EXPORT LICENCES.    :To secure Glycerine supplies  for manufacture  of cordite,oil-bearing material was only allowed to be exported subjectto certain &quot;Glycerine conditions&quot;  under which the  exporterhad either to deliver the glycerine equivalent  to  the  Ministryof Munitions or to make payments  in lieu.  The  amount  of moneyreceived is not precisely known,  but was probably  small.
