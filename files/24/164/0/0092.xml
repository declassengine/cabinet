-  J  -/          C       J[This Document is the Property  of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s  Government.)     Private and personal.  Your private and personal of 4th February.  Rangachariar&apos;s.resolution.  I am glad that Cabinet  is in agreement with the policy we  propose.Debate was postponed until Friday next.  Meanwhile we understand that the Swarajists,Independents and  others  will  concentrate upou the  following  amendment,  whichembodies  the  proposals   resulting  from  the  discussion  between  the Swarajists,Independents and others :     &quot; This Assembly recommends to the Governor-General in Council to take steps to-have the Government of India Act revised with a view to establishing full responsible;government in India,  and for the said purpose (a) summon  at an early date arepresentative round-table conference to recommend, with due regard to the protectionof the rights and interests of  important minorities, the  scheme of a constitution for;India,  and (5) after dissolving the Central Legislature, place the said scheme forapproval before a newly elected Indian Legislature for its approval  and submit  thesame to the British Parliament to be embodied in a statute.&quot;    When it is realised that Swarajists and Independents  together number 72, who-will be in fairly constant attendance, whereas, apart from Government official members,the attendance of  our supporters will be more fitful, it will he apparent that we shallbe defeated in the Assembly, and the   above amendment will  be carried.  Indeed, Iexpect that, apart from the  Government and European members, there will be verylittle support for Government.   My official  telegram  of 28th January represents thesubstance of my own views.   I must add that nothing short of concession, impossibleto contemplate, would satisfy the opinion of the Swarajists  and others  in Assembly.Whilst 1 am anxious to avoid deadlock or a bieak which Swarajists may wish to  bring-about, in view of past declarations, I am convinced that there is greater clanger inindications of concession in the future  which travel beyond the line of advance withinthe structure of the Act.   We must make our stand, and hold to it, and I am glad that-you and I are in agreement herein, as I understand your telegrams.  Nevertheless, wemust recognise that it will probably lead to trouble immediately.  I shall send further telegram later upon general position.   Object of present telegram is to  inform you ofcourse I have decided, after consulting Sir  M. Hailey, the  leader of  the House, to pursue in the debate.   I indicate the line, but not the language, which will, of course,be Sir Malcolm&apos;s.    It will be pointed out that Act of 1919 was framed with a view to the progressiverealisation  of responsible  government  in British India, and reliance will be placedgenerally, upon  the  preamble embodying recorded intentions of Parliament,  togetherwith proclamation.   The  system  is  devised hy  Parliament in the expectation  of goodwill and co-operation from India.   We  have had  only three years&apos; experience years of exceptional  difficulty, especially  in  the first half of this  period.   Non-co-operation section of the community  stood rigidly aloof  and vehemently  agitatedagainst the Constitution.  These  observations are intended to prove not only  thatthere has been no sufficient period of  test, but also that there has certainly not  beei^cordial  support throughout  the country generally in  the administration of the Act.The  plan  under tbe Act is carefully devised with the object of India&apos;s attaining, by successive  stages, full  responsible self-government.   The Imperial Parliament  gavepowers within the structure of the Act itself to expand aud develop the system.    It appreciated that experience would demonstrate the direction in which progress and  development should take place  for the purpose of  rendering  constitutionalsystem more effective, having regard to the objects of the Act.  My Government, areprepared now to examine, with  the assistance of  local Governments,  the desirabilityand  the feasibility  and  the extent of the advance to be made within the powers      7061    100  2.24Printed for the Cabinet.February 1924.SECRET.From Viceroy, 7th February 1924.
 conferred by the Act.  We shall thus  be carrying out the intentions of the Imperial Parliament.  Of  course  we  shall inform  the  Secretary of State and shall  keep  rn close consultation with him.   We should ascertain, to the  best of our ability, causes of complaints or defects in the working of the system, after taking into consideration the  views of local  Governments.  We shall propose,  as the result of our investi- gations, to submit our conclusions to  the Legislature or  possibly to  a Committee  of the Legislature and  others, for consideration  and approval before we made our formal recommendations  to His Majesty&apos;s Government for  their  approval and  that  of Parliament.  It will be observed that  our intentions  are limited to the possibility of expansion and development within the  Act itself, that is, under the powers deliberately. given by the Imperial Parliament for this purpose.      Should these proposals  for  advance within the Act be approved by Parliament Government of India will then  he able to  judge the  advances which should then  be made which would  require  amendment of the Act.   We shall then  have  had more experience of the  working of the Act, and, we hope,  of the benefits of goodwill and co-operation.  If, in  the result, we arrived at the conclusion that statutory Commission should  then be  appointed, we should  be prepared to make this recommendation  to His Majesty&apos;s Government, notwithstanding that the full period of  10 years  contem- plated under the Act had not elapsed.      The above is a  brief  summary of  my  views.  Hailey  is in complete agreement with me.  He has a very difficult task  in the  House.   The line above indicated is not intended to embody a specific  proposal in the nature, of an amendment  by us.  or which we should accept at this moment, but is an indication of the  policy we intend to pursue.  If you have no objection, we would add this policy has your support;  in any case, it will probably be assumed from  our announcement of it.     I. hold a meeting of my Council this evening for  the  purpose of  communicating the above  plan, and have no doubt shall have majority endorsing it.  It may be that Indian members will desire  more definite indication of  advance,  and particularlyaffecting general  structure of the present  Constitution and policy of  the immediatefuture.  They will probably  advocate  earlier appointment of Statutory Commission. If you have any objection please telegraph your views clear the line.               From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 7th February 1924.     Private  and personal.   Your private  and personal telegram of  7th February.The course proposed  to, be taken  in your telegram appears to me to be conceived in asequence not corresponding  with that  indicated in my telegrams.  Unless and untilcases are shown of unsatisfactory features in the present working of institutions, it  isnot my intention that yon should immediately promise formulation of  reforms withinthe Act.  The first thing to be  done  is to ascertain  to the best of your ability thejustifiable causes of complaints or defects in  the working of the system, after taking into due consideration the views of the  local Governments.  This  examination, and a judgment  on its  result,  must precede any undertaking to formulate proposals foi&quot;advances within the powers conferred by the Act.  Please take care  that this order  isobserved in the presentation of the matter.     It appears  to me that  it may  be extremely inconvenient  if you submit  yourconclusions to the Legislature and  obtain from it an  approved formulation  of them before submitting them through  the Secretary of State to His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor their approval and  that of Parliament, and I trust that, on further consideration,you  will avoid pledging yourself  to this course.  I would call  your attention to the distinction  drawn  in, my official telegram of  2nd  February,  between complaintsarising out of administrative difficulties in working the law and those  arising merelyfrom  impatience  with the transitional  position.  It  will be  recognised  that  theAssembly is much less able to judge of defects of the former type than of those ofthe latter.     Procedure I contemplate is, first, enquiry and consideration  as indicated  above;secondly, reference of results to me   with your recommendations with a  view  toagreed conclusions between us before,any reference is made to Legislature; thirdly,formulation of any necessary remedies, which  at  that stage may appropriately bediscussed  by Legislature  before&quot;introduction.  I cannot  see  beyond this  stage  atpresent,  and it would not be  right to hold out expectations that results of  enquirywill  lead  up  to proposals for: amendment of1 the Act.  Please refer to  penultimatesentence of my telegram of 2nd February as to Parliamentary Commission.  1
