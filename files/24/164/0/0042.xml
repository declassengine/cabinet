P. 42(24)              Mil; 132^3&apos; 3AIARIB3..Boto by the Permanent Seorotai-y to tho (Treasury,          In accordance with  the  instructions  of  the cabinet on 28th iasfent. I have  prepared,  and  circulate herewith note with reference to       A.   The Pooling arrangement  of 1917.       B.   Government Hospitality Pond.       C.   Ministers&apos; Official Heaidences and Servants.          It may not be out of  place  to  emphasise  thefact that the amounts and relativity of ministerial salaries as hitherto obtaining  are not the result  of scientific or logical consideration.   They have oomeinto being gradually over a long period  (e.g.  the   5,000of the Pirst lord of tho Treasury dates back to 1560 at latest) and rather haphasard, and it was not until 1920that the question was systematically  examined.   TheSelect Committee^ Report of December 19-20 has not boonput into forco,  but &quot;it does represent an endeavour to relate tho importance of the respective Ministerial posts and to introduce ordered principle into the whole  subject.It cannot be pretended that Spooling&apos;-&apos;1 either in intention                                                    or
or result has any regard to tho requirements or businessconditions of the case; it would be a more rule of thumbsubstitute for oonsidered classification; and it might easily, therefore, be even more illogical and unsciontificthan existing arrangements.   If change there haa to bo  -and the Cabinet will no doubt take into careful account the strength of the argument in favour of accenting enmasse Ministerial arrangements as they have been, forgenerations and even centuries - surely no easier target for criticism oould be provided than Spooling&quot;, andall the more so since it is common knowledge that therohas been since the 1$ar a real enqu-iry whioh providesdata and conclusions not available when tho war-time&quot;pooling^ was for special and emergency reasons temporarilyarranged.IvUSURY.

          ....           ,  A.  .         The Pooling Arrangement of 1917.          Under this arrangement Ministers&apos; salarieswere paid without deduction of Income Tax into a poolkept by the Paymaster-General, and the Pay Office onthe day following the date of collection made payment to each Minister include^ in tho pool of the salarydue to him at the uniform rate, less Inccnio Tax whichwas deducted (on the amount of salary actually paid atthe uniform rate) at the Pay Office.    Arrangementswore made so as to maintain the system by which incertain Departments the salaries of Ministers are notpaid quarterly but by monthly Instalment.          The 1917 pool arrangement was rather severely criticised on the ground that in tho result certain ministers received loss, and others more, than Parliamentvoted to  thorn, end generally on the ground that thescheme was an attempt to get round the intentions ofParliament as expressed in the Statutes.    It hadincidentally practical inconveniences, ecg* a vacancyin a particular office for even a few days involved acomplete reassessment.          -A list of the Ministers participating in thearrangement is given in the attached statement.

                   B.        Government Hospitality Fund,,     1,    The Government Hospitality Fund is fed byVotes, taken as and when required.    These Votes arein the form of &quot;Grants in Aid&quot; of the Fund.     2,     Table I. gives               (a)  the Votes for the Fund since its                        inception in 1908-9.                (b)  the expenditure from  tie Fund in each                        year from its inception, and               (c)  the balance on  the Fund at  the end of                        each year.     3.     Table II. gives the principal items ofexpenditure in the years 1908 to 1914, and 1919-23.     4,     The purpose of the Fund is to provide forsuch entertainment of Foreign and Colonial Ministers andMissions or International Conferences as may be necessary.The actual administrator of the Fund has always beenthe First Commissioner of norks of the day.      Inorder  to effect economy it has for some time been thepolicy to concentrate in the Fund any Governmententertaining required rather than to allow individual departments (e.g. Foreign Office, Colonial Office, WarOffice) to make arrangements for guests in &quot;ihom theymay be specially  interested.     5.     The cost of entertainments is only met fromthe Fund vhen  the responsible Department has satisfiedthe First Commissioner that there are public grounds for such a course.     6.     For all entertainment other than that provided from the Government Hospitality Fund, Ministers are themselves responsible.    How much this costs  in individual cases  cannot be stated:  but for manyMinisters
Ministers e.g. those in  charge  of  Secretaries of  StateOffices and of the Service Departments,  it must he aconsiderable item of expenditure.     In. this contextthe evidence given by Mr,Asquith before the SelectCommittee on Remuneration of Ministers  is important.He said              &quot;I do not  suppose my experience  is  in the         &quot;least unique but I was  a much poorer man when         &quot;I left office  than when  I entered.    The office         &quot;of Prime Minister, if it is to be properly         &quot;discharged, cannot I think be discharged x:nlees  a         &quot;mai has private means of his own,  on a  salary  of         &quot; 5,000 a year.    He has a number of duties,  if         &quot;he  is to perform his office properly,  of enter-         &quot;tslning end affording hospitality to all sorts         &quot;end conditions of people both at  home and  abroad,         &quot;which under the existing arrangement,  he has  to         &quot;defray entirely ft his own cost,&quot;
