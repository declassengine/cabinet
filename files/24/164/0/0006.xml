Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1924.CONFIDENTIAL,RECENT MEETING OF  THE  COUNCIL OF  THE LEAGUE  OF NATIONS.    THE  circulation  to  the  Cabinet  by Lord  Cecil  of  his  account  of theproceedings of  the last meeting  of  the  Council  of  the League  of  Nationsobliges . me to  issue  the  following  Note  which has  been  prepared  in theForeign Office and which is essential to  the proper  understanding of certain ofthe matters dealt with, namely, a number of questions relating directly or indirectlyto the reduction of armaments.   These are matters upon which several of theDepartments here  had and  have  expressed strong  views to which it is my  duty,as head of the Department responsible for the League of Nations business, to pay due consideration.   They came before-the  Council on this occasion  in the form of aseries of resolutions which had been passed by  the last Assembly, largely at the instance of Lord Cecil himself without previous consultation with either the ForeignOffice or the Cabinet.  When the resolutions appeared on the agenda of the council meeting, a memorandum, based mainly on the views of the War Office, admiralty and Air Ministry, was&apos; prepared for Lord Cecil&apos;s guidance in accordance with thepractice followed since the conduct of  League of Nations matters  was transferredto the Foreign Office.    On Lord Cecil demurring to the nature of these instructions it was agreed between us that, in view of the political situation in this country, it would be better for himnot to commit the  Government on any issue of importance, but to arrange for suchmatters to be deferred  till the next meeting of the Council.  The result of the pro-ceedings in Paris,  so far as these particular questions, are concerned, is not at allwhat I had hoped  for,  and appears to be very imperfectly covered by the brief andcondensed description in the first  page of Lord  Cecil&apos;s report.    I am  far from anxious, and indeed it  would now be useless, to provoke acontroversy  with my colleague on these  points.   But  the Department which  Irepresent is anxious that the Cabinet should know that  we are not responsible forsome of the conclusions  arrived at, and of which, equally with the Foreign Office, theywill probably disapprove.  Incidentally they illustrate the rather anomalous natureof the conditions under which  the  work of our representatives  at the League ofNations, ostensibly under the direction of the Foreign Office, is carried on.    Some of  the matters dealt ipth in the resolutions of the last Assembly of theLeague of Nations  concerning the reduction of armaments which came before theCouncil at its recent session were of considerable.importance.  As the reduction ofarmaments is  one of the matters specifically allotted to it under the terms of theCovenant, the Council was not necessarily restricted to the simple carrying out ofthe recommendations advocated by the Assembly.    Though no official explanation has been received from  him, Lord Cecil&apos;s reportshows that he took a line contrary to the sense of  the instructions issued for hisguidance in the following instances :     (1.)  The Assembly bad recommended  the Council to invite the Temporary mixed commission to draw up  one or more conventions to replace the existing convention of Saint-Germain respecting the international traffic in arms.    In the instructions  to Lord  Cecil it was pointed out tha.t the  Convention ofSaint-Germain had never been formally ratified because  the United  States had refused to join.  The League had endeavoured to  secure the participation of theUnited States on more than one occasion, and had finally extracted a definite answer that they would not ratify, partly because the convention had been concluded underthe auspices- of the League, and partly because they could not exercise the necessarycontrol of the arms traffic.  It was therefore useless for the League or anybody elseto draw up a fresh convention providing&apos; for a measure of control as effective as that      1902    un.&quot;-CUEZON OF KE.DLESTON.Foreign Office, January 3, 1924.NOTE.
   prescribed by the Convention of Saint-Germain since there could be no question of   obtaining the  co-operation of the United  States.-   Meanwhile  the Convention  of   Saint-Germain had been made practically operative by informal agreements between   the chief Powers concerned.  By this means good work was being done in preventing   arms from reaching turbulent races in  Africa and the  Middle East.  The afrange-   ment was, however, somewhat precarious, and the discussion of new conventions  by   the Temporary Mixed Commission could only weaken the authority of the Conventionv   of Saint-Germain without serving any other purpose.       Lord Cecil  was  accordingly requested to oppose the recommendation for  the   above reason.  Instead of this, he supported a recommendation that the United States   Government should be invited to co-operate with the  Temporary Mixed Commission   in drafting a new convention, and resisted a suggestion by the French representative   that the commission should suspend its labours pending receipt of the reply of  the   United States  Government.       (ii.)  The Assembly had recommended that the Temporary Mixed Commission be   invited to refer its scheme for the control of the private manufacture of arms to the   Economic. Committee  of the League for observations, and to co-operate  with that   dorrimittee in embodying the scheme in a draft convention for general acceptance.       The  instructions to Lord Cecil were  based  on the fact that the  scheme  in   question  was  founded  on a  licensing system which  involved  such  meddlesome   restrictions  on private  trade  that no  firm  could be expected  to  submit to them.   This alone constituted an insuperable  bar  to its  acceptance  by the United States   Government, who had published a statement to the effect that  their  objections  to   such restrictions were fundamental, and could not be met by modifications consistent   with the  structure of such a convention; nor  were they in a position  to  undertake   to secure the enactment of the legislation which would- be required.   At the same   time, the British Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry were agreed  that there   were most serious objections  to the scheme, which would add to the cost of the   services in peace and prejudice the defence of the country in war, besides raising   inconvenient questions of neutrality.    A  copy of the considered opinion of the   three Departments was sent to Lord Cecil, who, for the  reasons given, was informed   that the scheme of the Temporary Mixed Commission  should be opposed.       Lord Cecil,  nevertheless, supported the scheme.       (iii.) The  Assembly had asked the Council to request the  Temporary Mixed   Commission  to consider  the  possibility of  recommending,  concurrently with the   -general scheme for the reduction  of armaments,  the negotiation  of draft partial   agreements by  which individual States, or groups of States, would  mutually engage   to reduce their armaments.       It  was pointed out to Lord Cecil that  the Temporary Mixed  Commission was   not a suitable, body to consider this question.. A committee of persons  chosep for   their personal  competence, but without responsibility to their Governments,  might   be suitable for drawing up some general scheme in broad  outline,  but the position   became very different  when it  was a question  of drafting  definite  treaties between   particuTar countries,  e.g., Great Britain and France.  Such treaties could only be   prepared by persons responsible  to,  and  acting  under the  direct and explicit   instructions  of,  their Governments.   In; the  circumstances  the reference of this   question to the commission was strongly deprecated.      Notwithstanding this representation, Lord Cecil supported the  reference of this   question to the Temporary Mixed Commission.\     (iv.)  The Assembly had requested  the Council to invite  the&apos;  Temporary Mixed  NCommission  to continue its work for another year.   1   It  was  explained to Lord Cecil that the Temporary  Mixed Commission had   served  its purpose, and that the time for its dissolution had  come; that, as stated   above, it  was not the proper body to prepare a scheme  of disarmament agreements   between.individual States; and that,-as regards the draft treaty of mutual assistance,   the further stages ought to be left to the Governments themselves, through their repre-   sentatives on the Council, or to some body composed of Government representatives.   The War Office  and Admiralty were  strongly opposed  to, the continuance of the   Temporary Mixed Commission, and held that its duties could be better performed by   the Permanent Advisory Committee, which  is composed of representatives acting   under the direction of their Governments. ...      Notwithstanding  these views,  Lord Cecil supported the prolongation of the   mandate of the temporary Mixed Commission.
