                  PROPOSALS  FOR  LEGISLATION.              Memorandum by  the  Home  Secretary.      In drawing up  the  legislative  programme  for next Session-I am anxious that  the Government  shall give consideration to the followingHome  Office Bills.   (l) Factory Bill.  There  has  been  no general  amending legislationundertaken since the Factory  and  Workshop Act  of  1901, though eightsnail Acts amending  or extending  tho principal Act on particular points have been passed.   It  is high time that amending andconsolidating legislation was undertaken, and  the late Governmentincluded such legislation in  the  Kings Speech, A Bill has beenprepared in the Home Office  and can  be ready for  introduction at anearly date.   Its principal provisions  are to amend the law as to thehours of work for women  and  children,  to strengthen and oxtend theprovisions for preventing accidents  and securing  the health ofworkers, to bring within the  scope of  the Act  building operations and works of  construction which are  at present outside the FactoryAct,  to require improved lighting of workrooms and to effect various other improvements&quot;which are  desirable in view of the changed conditions and the experience acquired since 1901.      There is no reason to  think that the Bill.in its broad out-lines will be treated  as controversial by any  party, but a great dealof interest will  certainly be taken  in it by all  parties.&apos;      The Bill will  place nu  new  direct or immediate charge on theExchequer, but it will  lead  to a  number of new duties falling uponthe Inspectors of Factories,  and  the question  of  an increase in thei Inspectorate  will have  to be  considered if the Bill becomes law.This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.                      &apos;     CABINET.SECRET.                     -                         i nCP. 59(24)..           HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.
   (2.)  Northern Ireland Land Bill.   A Bill is required to carryout the recommendations of Lord Eustace Percy1s Committee on Landpurchase in Northern Ireland.  The late Government was pledged tointroduce this. Bill and it was mentioned in the Kings Speech,The landlords in Northern Ireland would,  I am told, generally beprepared to accept it as a fair settlement, but the tenants,although they agreed to the proposals,in 1918, now regard them as not sufficiently generous since the tenant in the Free State hasbeen given better terms.  The money required for the  proposals inthe Bill must be found by the Government of Northern  Ireland, whoare still anxious that the Bill should be proceeded with.      I think the Bill should be introduced on the understandingthat if it proves controversial it will not be proceeded with.   (5)  White Lead in Painting.  I have circulated a  memorandum[c.p. 53(24)] recommending that the Government should ratify theWhite Lead Convention adopted at Geneva in 1921.   This will mean the introduction of a short Bill providing (a) for the prohibitionof the use of white lead in internal painting (subject to certain exceptions) as from November, 192.7,  and (b) for the making of regulations for external painting and, during the interval beforeprohibition comes into force, for internal painting.   (4)  Criminal Justice Administration Bill.  The LordChancellor will, I understand, ask that a Bill on the lines ofthe Criminal Justice Administration Bill of last Session shouldbe proceeded with.  This Bill, makes a number of amendments in criminal procedure, amongst the most important boing  the proposals made by the Horridge Committee with the object of avoiding the detention for an undue time of prisoners awaiting trial at Assizesor Quarter Sessions.   (5)  Probation of Offenders.  In the Kings Speech  the lastGovernment included a reference to the development of the probation system.  It is most desirable to encourage  and extend the use of this hopeful system by means of a Treasury grant towards the salaries of Probation Officers etc.  For  the purpose
   ,                           :--3-:.&apos;,        /p: -     &apos;  -      v.^,;.of suoh a grant a Vote would be sufficient without a Bill, but itwould be better to combine with the grant certain amendments oftho law to secure more effective organisation.  The question isunder discussion whether these amendments could not.be effected by a clause in the Criminal Justice Administration Bill;  failing this a separate Bill should be introduced.  It would be quiteunoontroversial.   (6)  Coroners.  A Bill is long overdue to amend and consolidate the general law relating to coroners and inquests on the lines suggested by a Committee which investigated the question in 1910,and to amend the war time legislation as to the- holding ofinquests without juries by requiring juries for certain classesof cases e.g.  industrial accident.  The Bill will be-mainly non-controversial j   but much work will be required in Committee andsome controversial points may lead to discussion on the floor of .the House.  Many interests are involved, and publication of theBill will focus criticisms and&apos; suggestions.  It may be possibleto meet these and thus secure easy progress for the Bill,  Ishould be glad therefore to have authority to introduce the Billeven though it may prove impossible to find time this session forits further stages.   (ri )  Summer Time.  It is proposed at an early date to have aconference with the French and Belgian Authorities to see whetherit is possible to arrive at an agreement as to the date on whiohSummer Time should begin and end in all three .countries.  Therehas also boen considerable pressure for an.amendment of the act of 1922 so as to bring the whole of September within the periodof Summer Time.  It will be necessary at a later stage of the session to consider whether an amending Bill should&quot; be introduced.   (8)  \7ild Birds.  A Bill was introduced last Session by LordGrey at the instigation of the Home Office to amend and consolidate the Vftld Birds Acts.  Thin Bill passed the Lords but time could notbe found for it in tho Commons.   The amendment and consilidation of the existing law on thin subject If; very doairablo and if time
could be found I should like to  see progress&apos; made  with this Bill.Unfortunately it is a subject on which some controversy on matters of detail can hardly be  avoided,  and the Bill could probably not be passed unless an hour or  two could be found fordiscussion on Second Reading and Report Stago.   (9)  Prohibition of Night Baking.  This question is to bediscussed at the International Labour Conference at Geneva inJune and it will be necossary after the Conference to considerwhether legislation shall be introduced on this subject.      When a decision is corao to as to the Bills which it willbe possible to introduce this session, I  shall  be  prepared to circulate drafts, and I suggest  as regards the  Bills mentionedin this memorandum that the drafts of such of them as aro to beintroduced should be considered by the Home Affairs Committoo.A.
