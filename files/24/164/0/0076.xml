/y       0 /            P P&apos; 0THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                         CABINET..&quot;24.                 (HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. )             $Q                    MEASURING INSTRUMENTS BILL.        Memorandum by tho President of the Board of Trade.1.   The object of this Bill Is to remedy a defect in theexisting law, under which measuring instruments are free from any effective control.  Patterns of measuringInstruments can be submitted to the Board of Trade forapproval^ but are not  required to be so submitted; nor  aromeasuring instruments in actual use required to beperiodically examined by Inspectors of Weights and Measures.This position, which obviously gives scope for abuse, willbe remedied if the Bill is passed, and it will then bepossible to deal with several descriptions of measuringinstruments whioh ought to be subject to control.   Of these the most important at present are Petrol-measuring Pumps,and measuring Instruments used in Factories.2.   PETROL PUMPS.  Petrol-measuring pumps cf various types,which deliver petrol direct to the tanks of motor,cars fromunderground reservoirs, have been growing steadily in numbers for some years, and the question of their legalstatus has been raised from time to time by Local Authoritiesin all parts of the country, who are very dissatisfied withthe present position.  Complaints of short measure havealso been made by private individuals, and in the technicalpress;  and In America, where the pumps are muoh more commonthat they are here, a considerable amount of trouble hasalso been experienced.   On the other hand, the petrol-pump,with its underground storage chamber, is much to be preferred, from the point of view of public safety, to thetwo gallon ban, and is more convenient in every way, sothat there is no doubt that it will come much more ex-tensively into use in the future.  It is, therefore,desirable that the types in use should be brought under regulation before a large number of possibly unsatisfactorypumps are actually installed.3,   The principal makers of all types of these pumps desireto be brought under inspection, and have, in fact, submittedpatterns for approval under Section 6 of the Weights and measures Act, 1904, in readiness for any regulations whichmay be imposed;  and as already indicated, Local Authorities,Inspectors and users of petrol may be expected to welcome the propcs als in the Bill.                &apos;  ,4* MEASURING INSTRUMENTS USED IN FACTORIES.  The Bill willenable the Board and Looal Authorities to deal,with measuringInstruments used In factories for ascertaining w^ages, such as     (1) &quot;Wrap-reels&quot; used in textile factories for           automatically measuring the length of material           produced by a workman, and     (2) instruments for measuring by counting, such           as scales of unequal leverage which count a           large number of small articles, - e.g* screws -           by placing a few in one pan, and the bulk in the           other.
     The proposal to bring  such  instruments  within thescope of the Bill is concurred in by the Home  Office..f*  GENERAL.   The Leather  Measurement Act,  1919,  is repealed(except as regards Ireland, to which the Bill  does notapply), as all tho powers it conferred will  be exercisableunder the Bill.6.   It will be neither desirable nor practicable to bringall measuring instruments directly under the fullprovisions of the Weights and Measures Acts..  Hence  theprocedure under the Bill is by way of issuing  regulationsspecifying the description  of measuring instrument to bebrought under control, and  the provisions of the weights and Measures Acts to be applied.   It is intended to dealimmediately with the particular  cases mentioned inparagraphs 2 and 4 of this memorandum, and the  Bill gives the Board of Trade power to make regulations about otherkinds of instruments without further legislation.   Suchpower is likely to be needed having regard to  the trend of modern development.     Any regulations made under  the Bill will, under the weights and Measures Act, 1904,  require to be  laid beforeParliament as soon as may be after they are  made,7.   The result of bringing measuring instruments underOfficial control will naturally  be to throw  fresh work onthe Board of Trade and on the Inspectors of  Weights and measures belonging to the various Local authorities throughout the country.   The Beard of Trade already havepower under the lite i girts and Measures Acts to charge feesfor the examination of patterns  of Measuring instruments and to prescribe the fees to be  t&amp; en by Inspectors for examining such instruments.  These fees will be fixed so asto cover, as far as possible, the expenditure involved.8,   The Measuring Instruments Bill was introduced in theHouse of.Commons in 1922, but,  owing to pressure ofParliamentary business, it did not proceed to  secondreading in that session and no opportunity has since been found to introduce it again.  (A  copy of the 1922Bill is attached.)   While it was before Parliament in 1922there were no signs of serious opposition to it, and ifit is re-introducedx it could perhaps be got through asa non-contentious measure.   A large number  of localauthorities, associations, &amp;c, have made representations to the Board of Trade in favour of  the Bill..W.Board  of Trade,   6th February,  1924.xIn clause 3 the present reference to &quot;measuring instruments&quot; is   to be modified so as to restrict It to such instruments as   shall be specified by regulation or order.
