Memorandum by the Secretary.(Circulated under instructions from the Cabinet - Cabinet 7 ( 4)                     Conclusion 1 (b).1.    .  in recent years it has been customary at the.firstmeeting of a new Cabinet to give the Secretary instructionsto regulate his procedure.   A copy of the instructions which were approved&apos;by the late Government when Mr.Bonar lawcame into office Is attached in Appenalx    and a eojy ofthe instructions as regards Cabinet Committee in Appendix II. .2,     A few notes in regard to the Cabinet Secretariat maybe useful to the Cabinet.3.     There is a good deal of evidenoe in the GrerivillePapers and elsewhere that in the last half of the eighteenthoentury and the early days of the nineteenth century cabinet minutes were kept.   The original copy was sent to the King,but Ministers specially  ocncerned often kept a copy.   these minutes were probably drawn up by the Minister who summonedthe Cabinet, for  in those  days it was the right of the headof the Department chiefly  concerned  in a particular question to summon a Cabinet  to  discuss  it when  he thought desirable.During the nineteenth century the practice of keeping Minutesdied  put..  At  the time of  the outbreak of  the Great War  in 1914, the  only.record kept  of  Cabinet Meetings was the prime Minister&apos;s letter to  the  King, which  often contained  only the briefest reference  to  the  subjects  discussed,  and of which only one
copy existed in the personal custody of the  prime  Minister of-the day.  There mas no Agenda Paper, no central system  for, thedistribution of documents, for the notification of cabinet decisions to Departments, or for the co-ordination of the workof Cabinet Committees.4.    From the very moment of strained relations in 1914the disadvantages of &quot;this lack of system made themselves felt.During the first half of the War these defects were mitigatedby the concentration of much of the war business in a WarCouncil or War Committee, the secretary of which was theSecretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence.  When thesecond Coalition, was formed in December, 1916, all cabinet business was concentrated in a small War Cabinet,  wi-lth aSecretariat.  As the War Cabinet was in constant session,often two or three times a da^, the Secretary was allowedto bring Assistant Secretaries to the meetings;1 and a veryfull record of the proceedings was kept.5v     After the War, in November, 1919, the Governmentof the day reverted to a Cabinet  of pre-war dimensions,but retained the Secretary.  The custom of allowing thepresence  of&apos;Assistant Secretaries was dropped (exceptoccasionally;,in  times of great crisis, when meetings ofthe Cabinet mere very frequent), and the proceedings were kept by a single Seoretary, who attended all Meetings except on one or two occasions when there happened to be some question  before them which tho Cabinet preferred to discussprivately, 6.     Prom the regulations attached in Appendix I it willbe seen that the duties of the Seoretary under the late                          -2-
Government^were, - to keep a list of subjects awaiting&quot;consideration by. the Cabinet; after taking tho PrimeMinister&apos;s instructions to circulate the notice and Agenda.Paper . together with relevant documents,: for meetings;, toattend meetings of the Cabinet, unless it was otherwisedecided.,, for the purpose of recording Conclusions;  afterobtaining the prime Minister&apos;s approval, to circulate thedraft Conclusions to the King for information and to ministers, who, in practice, returned them to the secretary with any suggestions for amendment.  A.final version ineor-porating amendments was ,efter approval by the prime Minister,forwarded to. Members of the Cabinet for record.   ministers were themselves responsible for-  instructing  their Departments.as to the action  to be taken to carry out conclusions. :7, -    Every possible precaution is  taken to ensure theseorecy of Cabinet Conclusions.  The minimum personnelis-employed,  to  reproduce them, and only the  minimum hasaccess to them.   Thus, for, the, reproduction  of the Minutesa single Confidential Stenographer who has been  in the cabinet office for many years,,  is  employed, and he destroys hisnotes immediately they are transcribed.  .A Chief Clerk &quot;rollsoff&quot; the Roneo-ed copies&apos; and seals them up immediately in special envelopes,  which are marked  &quot;To be opened only by  theparson to whom addressed.&quot;,.   These  envelopes are locked in  theusual Cabinet  boxes.  Besides  the  Secretary  of the Cabinetjonly his private  Secretary has a key of. the  safe in which  1the standard copy of the Conclusions is kept.8;     The  present, holder  of the post of  Secretary  of  theCabinet  is  also Clerk of  the Privy Council  (of which  the Cabinet is a  Committee) and Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence.  The  principal Assistant Secretary is Mr. T. Jones
Jrom 1916 until 192E Mr. Jones constantly attended the Cabinet as Acting Seoretary during the frequentabsences of the Secretary at international conferences.  Since the formation of Mr. Bonar Law&apos;sGovernment however, Mr. Jones&apos; Services have been almost wholly absorbed by the Prime Minister,  andbe has virtually acted as Political Seoretary, first to Mr. Bonar Law and later to Mr.. Baldwin.  Duringthe last 12 months there WSB only one officer  inthe Cabinet Secretariat whose duties were devotedexclusively to the work of the Cabinet.  This  was mr. Howorth, an Assistant Secretary, of the Treasury,who, in addition to acting as liaison officer  withthe Treasury and understudy to the Seoretary,  hasacted as Secretary to the Home Affaire Committeeand the Unemployment Committee. (See below)9.   It is part of Mr.  Howorth&apos;s duty, as theTreasury liaison officer,  to ascertain, before any Paper involving expenditure i3 circulated  tothe Cabinet, whether the Chancellor of the exchequer has first been consulted regarding its contents.This give3 the Chancellor  of the Exchequer theopportunity of examining the financial aspects ofany proposal before it  is  circulated.   This was regarded as an ascontial element in Treasury financial control, and in practice has been found to work with- *out day delay, difficulty  or friction,10.  One of the most Important duties  of the cabinet secretariat is the distribution of doouments.   Withthe few exceptions mentioned below,:  all Cabinet
                                                215:   i documents  are circulated from the Cabinet Office. Where  the  facilities are adequate, as is usually the  case,  the Memoranda are reproduced within the Department  of the Minister concerned, and a sufficient  number of oopies are then forwarded to the Cabinet Office for distribution.  In a few oases where^ Ministers have not sufficient facilities, the Memoranda -x are  forwarded to the Cabinet Offioe for reproduction.&apos; Before issue to the Cabinet the Memoranda receive an official number and are indexed.  A circulation of Papers to Ministers takes place every evening from the Cabinet Office, and oftoner if required. The  only exception to the above procedure is in the case of Foreign Office telegrams and despatches and War  Office telegrams,  which are circulated to Ministers direot by the Foreign Office and War Offioo respectively, unless they are specifically referred for consideration by the  Cabinet,  in which case the normal procedure is followed. 11.  The clerioal and  messenger staffs of the Cabinet Office, which perform the work of reproducing, indexing,  distribution,  eto.  are pooled  with the Committee of Imperial  Defence.   The Establishment Officer who is in charge Of all these services, and the Private Seoretary to the Seoretary of the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence,  may be said  to serve both the Cabinet and the  Defence Committee. The combined clerical  staff (exclusive of messengers and charwomen) for the. Office of the  Cabinet and committee of Imperial  Defence consists of  0 persons.
             CABINET COMMITTEES.                       -  t12.    Cabinet Committees fall into two main  categories -Standing committee, which remain in being and are readyat any time for the consideration of questions with whichthey are concerned, and Special ad, hoo Committees, appointedby the Cabinet for the consideration of particular questions,the duties! of which are, as  a rule, ended when the Committeesreport to the Cabinet.   The attached list marked Appendix IIIgives particulars of the ed  hoo Committees set up in  1923 and gives some indication of  the subjects considered by them.13*   The Standing  Committees of  the Cabinet  under.thelate I Government were.three-in number -  .          The Home  Affairs Committee.-          The Unemployment--Committee,  and          the Committee  on Irish  Affairs.Under the Coalition Government there existed  a finance committee for the  consideration  of  the  most  important financial questions.&apos;   This. Committee  was  composed of  -          The Prime Minister (In tho- Chair)          The Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  (Sir R.Horne)          The Lord  Privy  Seal  (Mr.A.Chamberlain)          The President  of the Board  of Trade (Mr.Baldwin)          The Minister  of Health  (Sir  A,Mond)          The Permanent  Seoretary to  the         - Treasury.   (Sir W.Fisher) The  Seoretary to  the Cabinet and Mr.Howorth  acted  as Secretaries  to  the  Committee and the Committee!s procedure olosely  resembled that  of the Cabinet.      The following note  indicates briefly  the nature and scope of the three  Standing  Committees  abave-referred to
3 AFFAIRS    1-4,   The  Home Affairs Committee was established ITT,as,            by  the  war   Cabinet  in July 1918 arid has functioned;            a6tively  since that  date.   17 Meetings ware held            in  1923.                      The Committee was&apos; an advisory body (See           Appendix  II) and its Conclusions end Recommendations           were, invariably submitted to the Cabinet for&apos; approval           before action was taken upon them.  These Conclusions           and Recommendations were incorporated in the printed           Minutes of the Committee which were circulated to           all: Members of the Cabinet as well as to the Members           of,the Committee.    They were finally incorporated with           Cabinet Minutes in form of Appendix.                      The Home Affairs Committee was ooncerned           with questions of Home legislation and&apos;administration           excepting Unemployment questions which fell for           consideration:to the Unemployment Committee and  questions           referred by the Cabinet&apos; to ad  hoo Committees.  Questions           of Foreign and Colonial  Affairs seldom,  if ever,           came within the purview  of&quot;the Committee and then           only in so far as  they might  affect the  Home aspect           of the particular-question under consideration.   The           same applied, to Service  Department  questions.                      The principal function of the Home  Affairs           Committee  was to relieve the Cabinet&apos;of  the  detailed           consideration of the large volume  of legislative  and           administrative  work coming up  to the Cabinet,  while           leaving to the  Cabinet the ultimata&apos;decision on these           questions..                                                   /As
         As will  be seen from the  list  of subjects considered by the  Committee  in the1     218 last  threo  years  (Appendix   V   attaohed);,the Committee has been  mainly,  but by  no  means exclusively, concerned with the examination of Government  Billsi    Under  the existing procedure no  ordinary Departmental Bill may  be  submitted tb  Parliament Until after it  has been subjected to  examination in the  Home  Affairk Committee kind -tho Conclusions of that Committee have been approved by the Cabinet.  In  practice,  the examina- tion  in the  Home Affairs  Committee of these Bills ha^ been most useful and  helpful, particularly ih two directions;   In the  first place, an oppor- tunity was  given for Ministers in Departments other than  the Department of  origin of the bill to express  their views  as regards matters, often of minor importance, directly or indirectly affect- ing their Department,  and secondly, the Daw Officers were  enabled to discuss the legal-aspects of ,the legislative proposals  with their colleagues and  to explain the numerous legal and technioal difficulties which often arise oh Billsi   As a result of the detailed consideration  in the Committee, agreed modifications and  amendments were often introduced into  the Bills at  this  Stage and  difficulties  were removed by discussion whloh would otherwise involve considerable departmental correspondence and Iocs of time;         Another very useful function of the Home.Affairs Committee  has been the consideration from time to time of the Government&apos;s  legislative programme in relation to the  Parliamentary time  available and the Committee has made suggestions to the Cabinet  as to the legislation  which should be expedited,  deferred
foSITIONmIlTTEE.     The composition of the Home Affairs Committee under  thelate Government was as followsLord Cave (Chairman)Mr. W.C, BridgemanSir P, Lloyd-GreameSir W. Joynson HicksSir R.A. SandersSir Montague BarlowViscount NovarSir Laming Worthington-     Evans &apos;Sir Douglas HoggSir T. InskipThe Hon.Walter Guinness210Lord Chancellor.S/S for Home Affairs.President of the Board of Trade.Minister of Health.Minister of Agriculture and    Fisheries.Minister of Labour.Secretary for Scotland.Postmaster-General,Attorney-General,Solicit or-General.Financial Secretary; Treasury.      Mr. R.B. Howorth (Assistant Secretary, Cabinet)         Secretary to the Committee.     It will be observed that, with the exception of thePresident of the Board of Education, the Committee containedMinisterial representatives of all the Departments whichcommonly bring questions before it.   Having regard to thelegal aspects of the great majority of these questions, theCommittee has always included the Attorney-General and the solicitor-General, while, during 1923, the Lord chancellor was the Committee&apos;s Chairman.   Although the Chairman neednot, of course, be a lawyer, there are obvious advantages inhis having experience of legal terminology and parliamentary procedure.   Treasury representation on the Committee isessential and the Financial Secretary has always been aMember,   Experience shows the great advantages of Includingon the permanent membership of the Committee the MinisterialHeads of those departments which are mainly concerned with home questions (The Board of Trade, Health, Agriculture,Labour, Scotland, Education and Post Office).   While no doubt
 it would be  quite practicable  for  the  Committee to carryk&amp;il business with  a  smaller personnel,  inviting to its meetings Ministers  not  represented on the Committee  on occasions when subjects of interest  to those Ministers were under discussion, nevertheless,  the  interconnection of administrative and legislative questions is not so close and complicated and  has such re-actions  that  the exclusion from the Committee of Ministers  responsible for the Departments in question would probably result  in decreased effioienoy.      The secretarial arrangements of the Home Affairs Committee  were undertaken by the Cabinet Offioes  which were responsible for  &quot;the circulation of papers and the preparation of the Committees Minutes.  All memoranda considered by the Home Affairs Committee were in the Cabinet series and the Committee considered no papers Which were not circulated to the Cab inet as a Whole. 15.  The Unemployment  Committee was first appointed at the Cabinet in August, 1920  (Cabinet 48 (20) Conclusion 2). The Committee dealt with all the varied aspects of the Unemployment problem.  During the three and a half years ef  its  existence the Committee held 72 Meetings and in  addition, there, have been numerous meetings of Sub-Gommittees ,pf  the  Committee.  A list of these Sub-Committees is given, in Appendix IV. i    -Like the Home Affairs  Committee the Unemployment Committee was an, advisory body.   (See Appendix II).   Its jbnclusions and Recommendations were incorporated in periodical , Reports which were submitted to the Cabinet ft r approval and the Minutes of the Committee were  circulated to all Cabinet Ministers, whether Members  of the Committee or not.&apos;     Under the late Government the composition of the Unemploy- ment Committee was as  follows:-

The Prime Minister will instruct the Seoretary as to what &apos;subjects are to be placed on  the  Agenda paper of the  Cabinet.  the secretary will give Ministers as  long notice as he can as to whensubjects are likely to be discussed, and will issue to members ofthe  Cabinet a weekly  list of  subjeots awaiting consideration.  2.  The Secretary  will attend meetings of the Cabinet, unlessinstructed to the  contrary, for the purpose of recording the-conclusions.  3,  In the absence of instructions to the contrary the record isto be  as short as  possible, and,  apart from the conclusion itself,should normally be limited  to such explanation as is indispensable to render the conclusion itself intelligible.  As a general  rule itshould suffice to  refer  to  any documents circulated to the Cabinet;before the meeting, and  to  any supplementary data produced at themeeting.  In. particular  cases a statement by a Minister may, byiecision of  the  Cabinet, be reproduced and annexed to the Minutesalter appz-oval by  the Prime Minister and correction by theMinister  concerned.   4.  One  copy  of the draft Minutes will be sent to the King as heretofore  &quot;with Humble  ]hity&quot; from the Prime Minister.  (As a general rule only  one  other copy of Cabinet Minutes will be taken, which,after approval by the Prime Minister, will be filed under theSecretary^  personal charge in the  Cabinet Office)^   6.

The Minutes of the Cabinet are  always to be avail-able for consultation by Cabinet Ministers, either in theSecretary&apos;s Office or, during meetings of the Cabinet, Inthe Cabinet room.     8,   The Secretary Is to take all possible precautionsfor ensuring that In the reproduction of  Cabinet  Minutesthe minimum staff Is employed,  and that access to cabinet minutes  is limited to Cabinet Ministers.     9.   Subject to any instructions he  may receive  fromthe Prime Minister or the  Minister from  whom a documentoriginates in regard to any  particular paper, the Seoretary willcirculate to Members of the  Cabinet  all  Memoranda and other documents prepared for the use  of the Cabinet.    Subject to reference in case  of doubt,  to  the Prime  Minister or  theMinister from whom a document  is received,  the Secretary  willhave  discretion to circulate Cabinet papers to Ministersoutside  the  Cabinet whose  Departments are affected.   He  Isalso  authorised to send additional  copies to Ministers attheir request,     10.
