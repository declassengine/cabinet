    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]                    Printed for the Cabinet.     January 1924.SECRET.CP. 34(24).                                  CABINET.    I circulate to my colleagues the following urgenfprivate  telegrams  dated  26thand 28th January which I have received from the Viceroy.    28th January 1924.                                   SYDNEY OLIVIER.                        From Viceroy, 26(/v January 1924.    Private and personal.  Our official telegrams regarding our proposed attitude inLegislature on  Gandhi  and constitutional  advance.8&apos;   1  address the  Legislature on31st instant, when I open the new Session, and cannot avoid the indication of my own views.  My speech  as Viceroy is not intended to present  the Government ofIndia&apos;s views.   I do not  consult my Council upon it,  and they are  unaware of. theterms of  speech or policy I may indicate.  Nevertheless, speech is usually  assumed,and rightly, to represent the policy the Government  of  India will pursue.  I canavoid reference to Gandhi, but must deal with the situation created by the  return toLegislative Assembly, and to Provincial  Councils, of  large  number of Swarajists,whose  avowed  policy  is  to  obtain  complete  Swaraj  immediately, or to  obstructand  destroy  the  present Reform Scheme.  The  first being out  of  the   question at present, the alternative will come into operation, so far as Swarajists can achieve it.Objective of my speech will  be to steady the Independent and Moderate  members,and prevent them from  voting with  Swarajists on important  matters.  The threeoutstanding questions are  (1)  treatment of Indians overseas, (2) Oandhi&apos;s release, and(3) Constitutional advance.  I have already addressed  you privately on (1) and awaityour reply upon  (3).  We yesterday had  long Council meeting  and  unanimouslydecided that  the resolution for discussion on  4th February demanding immediateself-government  should  be  definitely  opposed.   My  Council  felt, however,  thatwe  should assuredly be challenged  to  state our  policy, and  that  we  should lose all prospect  of Moderates&apos;. support if  we flatly refused to state it, or  conveyedthe   impression   that  we should  not  consider  any  change  either within  or without  Government of  India  until  after  report   of   the  Commission to beappointed in  1929.   My intention  in  my  opening Address   is  to appeal toModerates, and  others who are not avowed members of the Swarajists&apos; party, not tospoil the prospects of advance by obstructive action which will cause unfavourableimpression in  English  Parliament,  with whom  all  important changes in  theconstitution  rest, and  which  will thus  delay  progress  desired.   But  I should be careful to  avoid  conveying  the impression  that  no  advance  could be consideredtill  after&apos; the Commission  of  1929.  It is quite impossible for me to speak withoutreferring to constitutional advance, for  it is being pressed, in one form or another,upon us from various quarters both in the Legislature and outside it.   The formationof the Labour  Government  makes  it especially imperative  that  notion should be discouraged that  immediate  grant  of&apos; self-government will  be made.  No one inIndia really expects it,  but much play  is being made with idea,  based upon somepast utterances, and our difficulties both in the Central and Provincial Legislaturesare  already sufficiently great. I  shall  address  you  privately  as well as  by my government, upon political conditions of India, and possible avenues of  advance, butthis cannot be done hurriedly, or by telegram.                        From Viceroy,  28th January 1924.    Private and  personal. In continuation  of my private telegram  of  the 26th.There  will be  a  slight delay in the  official  telegram   regarding  constitutional advance reaching you, but I hope it will  reach you by to-night.* The second of these official telegrams has not yet arrived, but will be circulated on receipt. 7023    100  1.24
