The Committee have had under examinationproposals submitted to them by -the Colonial Office for undertaking certain urgent railway projects in tropicalAfrioa, the carrying out of which would tend to relieve unemployment at homo,     12,   Prom the Imperial point of view the mostpromising of these proposals is ono which relates tothe extension of the uasl-rt Gishu Railway through theE&amp;vironde province of Kenya and the eastern province ofUganda to Jin ja( Riron Falls) on the Victoria Hyayttza,Details of the proposals will be found in the  noteappended to this Report, but it may be pointed out the tthe construction of this railway will open up a districteminently suitable in all respects for the growing,ofcotton, tho present output of which (80,000,    bales ayear) oould, given reasonable transport facilities-, be
roadily increased to 500,000 bales per annum^ or,      J, (] j$according to some estimates,. 1,000,000 bales per annum.The proposals-, are in substance strongly supported bythe British Cotton Growing Corporation.   The&quot;scheme,as a whole, \t estimated to cost  6,150,000 and  it willbe &quot;observed that while  in putting forward the scheme theGeneral Manager suggested that it might be undertakenunder a loan from the Imperial Government free of interest for a period pf 10 years, the Governor has since advocatedthe approval, of the proposals on the basis of, theImperial Economic. Conference scheme, namely  the  grant from Imperial funds of  throe quarters of the  interest for years,     13,   It has not been possible for the Committeeto examine in detail the financial aspects of the proposals.,which, moreover, raise  various technical issues, but theCommittee have no hesitation In recommending-  the Cabinetto accept the scheme in principle as one which will hotonly assist in the relief of unemployment, but., will whencompleted contribute materially.towards the solution ofthe British cotton shortage problem.-The Commit toe recommend-  (i)   .-That approval should be given in principle  to the proposals for the  extension of the uasin-  Gishu Railway and the relaying pf the Mombasa-&apos; .  Hairoli section of the Uganda.Railway, at a total  ooBt oi-- 6,,15Q,000 on the  lines 3et out in the  Appendix to this Report,  subject, as regards the - Uasin Gishu- extension, to  sueh alterations is  the  setting out of the lino as may be agreed  between the Colonial Office, and the. Cotton Growing  Corporation.  (il)  That the Treasury and the Colonial office  should be authorised to examine the financial  aspects of the proposals  with a view to the&quot;  scheme being financed on terms, as favourable as  the  circumstances may permit.

The Committee have requested the ColonialOffice to examine the possibilities of proposals  &apos; -submitted by the Cotton Growing Corporation f6r theconstruction of a branch&apos;line cdrinecting the VictoriaNianza with Tabo^aon the Luango Daresselah Railway andalsf a line connecting Sokoto with the main NigerianRailway,                     Signed on behalf of the Committee.   &quot;&apos;-   &quot;&quot;&apos;                  &apos;   Li, WORTHINOTON-EVANS.

                A PRciNDIX..      EXTENSION OF  THE UASIN OI3HU RAILWAY.             note bv  the  Colonial  Of floe,.  ,           The main proposal is to extend the Uasinpishu Branch,which is now nearin/;. -completion, throughthe Kavirondo-Province of Kenya and the-EasternProvince of Uganda to- Jinja. f Rip on falls) on the victoria Nyanza.  This&apos; &quot;would mean the tapping in kenya of a province which -contains a large- andindustrious population and In Uganda of the maincotton growing district.   As regards ,this latterdistrict the railway is to be supplemented by a branch railway sf 75 miles and by various feederroads (estimated to cost  .130,000) required for theopening up ef the country to. its fullest extent.  Itis calculated that the result of this will, be to place a considerably increased acreage, under  cotton, and itis hoped that within a few years this continued withthe simultaneous development which may be expected, in uganda proper -would lead to an output of cotton whiohis now about  80,000 bales a year being  increased t*something like 500,00-0.  There is therefore every reason to suppose that the proposal would pay its way at an early date, and it should also make thenew Uasin OiShtk branch remunerative earlier than would otherwise be the ease.           The length of the new trunk  line is roughly160 miles.   Instructions have been given for the survey to be put in hand at once.  Until the report is received,  it is impossible to give an accurate estimate of  the.cost, but a provisional figure forthe trunk line ana the 75 mile branch referred tohas been given by the General Manager at  2.,350,000.           &quot;:&apos;:    &apos;    -i- ::   &apos;.-
     In addition, it is proposed as part of the new scheme to expedite the relaying cf the Mombasa-Nairobisection,of the Uganda Railway with an 80 lb. rail,the present track being utilized for the following newbranches in Kenya, namely    &apos; (1)  Thika - Nyeri              91 miles,,     (2)&apos;  Soy Road - Kitale,          44   &quot; -  -  - (3)  Rongai - Sola!             23   &quot;     (4&apos;)  Mumlas. - Yala branch   &apos;          of new trunk line          35   &quot;Total   193 milesThe total cost of. theee additional works would be                                 &quot;  .Ralaying 193 miles..            1,100,000Branch lines                   1,250,000                       Total   2,350,000   &quot;&apos;     If the whole section to Nairobi were relaid the&apos;extra cost would be  700,000,     These railway&apos; developments are expected to produceadditional traffic which would necessitate the provisionof an additional berth at Kilindini, the cost of whichwould be  750;000.    ^ -  -     The total of all- these services is  6,150,000,  -     The General Manager put forward this scheme, after careful consideration of the capacity of the country,  as one which might be undertaken under a loan- from the  ImperialGovernment free of interest for a period of 10 years.    Onthe receipt.of the Circular telegram relating to the Imperial                          -2-                   /economic
Economic Conference Scheme, the Governor still advocated.the approval of the proposals on the new basis.              1     It is, however, necessary for the Secretary of state to satisfy himself that the country is.able to bear animmediate increase in interest charge of some  175,000 ayear for 5 years rising then to  280,000 a year 4- SinkingFund, in addition to the burdens imposed by the existing loan of  5,000,000 the further  loan of  3,000,000 which is to beraised inthe near future, and tho War liability which mayamount to  1,500,000.     The Railway System of Zenya and Uganda has been recently divorced from.the ordinary Administration of thetwo Dependencies.  Financially, it is  in a sound position.The security for any loan, however, would be the jointsecurity of  the Railway and the two Dependencies.     As regards the financial position of the two  Dependenciesapart from the Sailway, Zenya has an adverse balance of 376,000 at the end of 1923 and it is only expected that areduction of.  9,000 can be effected in the ensuing financialyear.  This adverse balance is largely due to postponed-military charges which have now been brought to account.Uganda*s position is sufficiently sound, but it has beenneoessary to begin to repay sums m account of War liability,amounting, if the Treasury view is accepted, to a lump sumcf  175,000 at once, with an annual contribution for future years not exceeding  50,000.     It would be essential, ^in adopting any scheme of capitalexpenditure for the relief of unemployment, that the chargeste be  incurred should have priority over any payments onaccount of War liability to be made by either Dependency.Subject to this stipulation the General Managerrs proposals would appear to be suitable for adoption on the basis onwhich they were framed, namely that the loan should be free of interest for 10 years and (presumably) that any charge for  Sinking Fond should also be postponed for that period.
