( \f                     ARBITRATION CLAUSES (PROTOCOL)  BILL.             Memorandum by tho President of the Board of Trade.            The  principal commercial organisations,  and in particular       the  International Chamber of Commerce,  have, recently devoted       very great  attention to obtaining the removal of the impedi-       ments offered by the legislation and practice of certain       foreign countries to the smooth and successful working of       agreements  to refer to arbitration future questions that  may       arise under a commercial contract, the  parties to which belong       to  different countries.  The whole question having  been       brought before the Economic Committee of the  League of Nations       by  the British Member, that Committee in the  summer of 1922       set  up a  special sub-committee of jurists and commercial       experts to  examine the question and report.  The British       member of this special sub-committee, Mr.F,D. Maokinnon,K.C,,       acted as  chairman.            The  Council of the League circulated the Mackinnon report       with a strong recommendation in favour  of the adoption of Its       proposals.   The Economic Committee resumed consideration  of       the  question in January, 1923, and the  Council set  up a       drafting  committee of legal experts (including-the  assistant       legal adviser of the Foreign Office), whose draft Protocol       was, however, subjected to amendment by the Economic       Committee,,   The draft Protocol in ite revised form  was  cir-       culated to  the States, members of the League;  and at the       next meeting of the Assembly it was further revised  to meet       objections  raised by the legal experts  of a number  of.       countries,  and a resolution was  adopted that  the  ProtocolDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.  -
in its final form should be open for signature by all Statesdesirous of adhering thereto.  The Protoool was signed atGeneva on 24th September, 1923, on behalf cf His &apos;Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Governments of Prance, Belgium, Greece,Lithuania, Brazil, Uraguay and Panama,  Italy has sincesigned.  It remains open for signature by other States.  it comes into force after ratification by two States and there-after takes effect in the case of each contracting State enemonth after the deposit of its ratification.     The intention is that the Protocol should be ratified by His  Majesty&apos;s Covernment after the passage of the attachedBill.     A copy of the Protocol itself appears as the, schedule tothe attached draft Bill,  The Protoool provides that the ccn-tracting States will recognise the validity.of agreements bywhich the parties to a contract agree to submit to arbitra-tion differences (existing or future) which may arise inconnection with the contract; that they will ensure the enforcement of arbitral awards made in their OTTO territory;and that if oases are brought before the ordinary Courts inrespect of contracts which provide for arbitration,  theCourts shall refer the parties concerned te the decision ofthe Arbitrators, without prejudice however to the competence of the Courts If the arbitration proceedings cannot  proceed..     There Is already in force in England and Wales  an Actdealing with arbitration (the Arbitration Act of 1889).  Z%does not apply to Scotland and Northern Ireland.  This Actprovides that arbitration awards on a Submission shell been forced in the same manner as judgments or Orders cf Court,In regard to litigation brought forward in respect of a dispute the subject of arbitration,  the Arbitration  Act(Section 4) leaves It to the discretion of the judge or Court
   whether an Order shall he made  staying the proceedings.-  Under   the Protocol, such  an Order  must  be made.  Legislation is   necessary to give effect to  this  requirement, and in the case   of England and Wales amendment  of Section 4 ef the Arbitration   Act is necessary so far  as concerns arbitration agreements to   which the Protocol  applies.   It will receive support from the   commercial community,among whom the Pr&amp;trfool has been   welcomed; and the Bill might have an early introduction in   the Lords.
