THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT.0 A BIN E T.    /WAGES OP WAR DEPARTMENT WORKMEN IN THE LONDON AREA.             MEMORANDUM 3Y THE MINISTER 0? LABOURoSECRET.CP-IS (84).     The memorandum (CP. 3 (24)) by the Secretary ofState for War raises the question whether some newprinciple other than that of the Pair wages resolution could, or should, be adopted in fixing the wages of the men in the War DepartmentEstablishments,     When times become more normal the question of adopting some new principle - and if so, what   in place of the Pair Wages Clause may arise:  at present :- think it is undesirable to embark on any such general discussion.     But - without&apos;entering on that - it may beadmitted that for the time&apos; being certain classes ofthe War Department Workmen have a prima-facie case for some adjustment.  It must, however, bo borne inmind that expedience has shown the advantage to theGovernment of being able to remain outside industrialconflicts as to wagos, etc, and to follow thedecisions that are reached as a rosult of collective bargaining in outside industry.   Ho-ever welcome   *an adjustment on some basis other than the Fair WageoResolution might -be to those grades for which outsiderates are at the moment low, it is certain that theadvantage which those grades would secure now wouldnot be allowed to count if, later on, the outsiderates for those grades were raised;  the Unions would
                            s.                       ; if     IIIIinsist then that the Government should pay the outside rate,  andthe Government would lose both ways,     The intrusion of the argument that oertain outside rates donot provide a &quot;living wage&quot; is in my view most dangerous,,   Thegeneral policy of the Government in regard to industrial affairs is &quot;Non-interference&quot;;  however attraotive the prospeot may be of trying to give the Government industrial workmen a rate that is a&quot;living wage&quot;, I cannot imagine any more certain way of bringimg theGovernment inextrioably into a wrangle between employers andTrade Unions.     Similarly, to agree to the suggestion that the whole of alarge composito establishment 3uoh as Woolwich  Bhould be regardedas a unit and all grades paid alike, irrespective of craft, wouldbe likely to involve the Government in the intricate question ofIndustrial Unionism versus Graft Unionism, a question which mayhave to be disou3sed in industry generally, but which should notbe pre-judged by action on the part of the Government.     Neither of these two difficulties is I think, likely to arise provided we adhere to the Fair Wages principle,     Accordingly, the question seems to reselve itself into oneof the precise application of the Fair Wages principle to thedifferent grades.  It is understood that as a result (i) of thegrant during the War of uniform advances to all grades within the establishments, and (*i) the uneveness of the reductions in out-side grades, anomalies^now exist, certain grades in the government establishments receiving, In faot, leso than the outside rates.So long as this exists the men oonoerned have a definite grievance,and they are likely, from various motives, to receive support fromtheir colleagues, even though the latter may themselves be inreoeipt of rates that compare favourably with the outside rates.The way to deal with this seems to be to examine into the whole matter grade by grade.
                        - 3,                          ftC     It may be considered to be impossible to have sucha review undertaken now in view of the Secretary of State&quot;Bundertaking to secure a Government decision in respect ofthe unskilled men without delay.  Moreover.general indixstrialconditions are still unstable and. there is in outsideindustry, with which comparison would have to be made, anabnormal relativity between the various classes of workers.It appears to me, however, that the difficulties would beincreased both for the War Office and for other Departmentsby an arbitrary addition to the wages of unskilled manwhich would neither remove their grievance nor bedefensible on tho accepted interpretation of the lair wages resolution.  I would suggest, therefore, that the decision in respect of the unskilled and semiskilled men shouldn  beto offer t. Qmi refer.a claim for a definite amount to arbitra-tion,  and that, in the present circumstances, theGovernment should not itself take the responsibility for determing the issues.  It is essentially a case which requires a closer examination of the facts in relationto prevailing industrial conditions than, with the materialat its disposal, the Oabinet is in a position to undertake.     With regard to the Saddlers and other non-engineeringcrafts the question is again one to be determined on tne.basis of the Pair Wages Resolution in the light of theconditions prevailing in establishments comparable withthose of the War Office.  I understand that It has notboen possible to find saddlers employed in a comparablecapacity in London and, therefore, their case appears tobe one which should properly be referred to arbitration.Even if it-were decided that the Woolwich establishmentsare engineering establishments ( and I do not feel thatthere is sufficient information before the Cabinet toenable It to reach such a decision) I think the caseof these men should still be the subject of arbitration.                                            /With
     With regard to the application of the rates for overtime and night shift work in the Overtime and night shift Agreement of the Engineering Trade, tho following considerations arise -     (a) This would assume that all the Woolwich          Establishments aro Engineering Establishments,          a matter yet to bo decided,     (b) The effect of this action on other C-cvernment          Industrial Establishments requires examination,     (o) The memorandum doos not state whether  the views          of the Trade Unions have been ascertained and          it is assumed, therefore, that  the Unions have          not been consulted.  As thero aro  Joint Induebrla          Councils upon which the Unions are represented          I think that it is- necessary that discussion          should take place in order that the Cabinet may          consider the matter with the views of the Unions          before them,     I feel, therefore, that it is not possible at present to reach a decision on this points     Tho transfer of 7s. to tho base rate again involves the.question  of the naturo of the Woolwich establishments and it is not necessarily the case that aotion  based onthat of tho engineering trade is applicable  to  all classesof workers.  This matter, therefore, should, in my opinion,receive further and more detailed consideration.  If thequestion of the rates of the unskilled workers  is referredto arbitration, the finding of the Court will doubtless be  of assistance in reaching a conclusion on this matter  ,also.
