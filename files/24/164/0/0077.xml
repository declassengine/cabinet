&quot;6 5 iHIS DOCUllGOT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANJTIC KAJT,STY&apos;S  GOV7SRBMMT)3 C R 3 T.,P,  76  (24).          6Copy No.  f -J    C A B I if S I...Unemployment Insurance.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Ixohequer.         As stated by the Minister of Labour in his memorandum cp. 45 (24)  the Treasury concur in the proposal to introduce a one-clause Bill into Parliament as soon as it meets,abolishing the &quot;gap&quot; of three weeks;  but I would urge mycolleagues to think twice before abolishing the present restrictions on the grant of uncovenanted benefit to certainclasses of applicants.    These restrictions are sat out asfollows in the recent report of the Ministry on UnemploymentInsurance, pages 113-4            &quot;The minister has decided that it ia not          expedient in the public interest that          uncovenanted benefit should be paid to             (l). Single persons (both juvenileB and                 adults and including widows and widowerB                 without dependent children) who are                 residing with parento or relatives to whom,                 having regard to all the circumstances,                 they can reasonably look for support during                 unemployment.In
               !In the application of thia limitation                      the Minister has directed the Local Com-                      mitteee that in the absence of special                      circumstances: benefit 3hou.ld not be                      withheld from single persons over the age               i      of 25;                      (2) F&amp;rried women living with their                          husbands who are in employment and                          whose incomings are sufficient to                          justify the withholding of                          Uncovenanted Benefit from tho wife,                          A similar limitation may alao be                          applied to married men whose wives                          are in employment0                      (3) Persons who are working short tine                          and whose incomings are sufficient                          to justify the withholding of Un-                          covsnanted Benefit.   Ordinarily this                          Will be the case if they are earning                          on the average half or more than half                          their normal earnings,                      (4) Persons who are unwilling to accept                          on fair terms and conditions work                          other than that to which&quot;they are                          accustomed but which they are                          reasonably capable of performing.                                                       .  (5)x These provisions were added in April 1023 in response to  suggestions made during the paasage of the Unemployment Insurance  Bill 1923.
           (5)  Aliens other than:-                 (a) British-born wires and British-                     born widows of aliensi                 (b) Aliens who served with H,M.                     Forces (or in certain cases                     as merchant seamen) daring                     the late war;&apos;                 (c) Aliens hot being former enemy&apos;                     aliens, who have been qon-x    (               tinuously resident in this                     country since the 1st January,                     1911.Single perraons residing Twth parents,    in determining whether uncovenanted benefit shouldbe paid to single persons residing with parentsor other relatives, the test applied is whetherthe total incomings of the household are sufficientto justify the withholding of benefit from theapplicant.   Where the circumstances indicate thata disallowance of benefit would lead to hardship,the claim would be allowed;  where, however,  theincomings of the household and the general circum-stances are such as to make it not unreasonablethat the applicant should look to his parents orrelatives for support during unemployment, theclaim is disallowed,        For this purpose it Is necessary to ascertain the total incomings of the household and the numberof persons dependent thereon.    This enquiry ismade when the applicant is being,,interviewed by theCommittee,    No definite standard per head ofa household has been laid down,    Considerablediscretion is given in this respect to the localCommittees.                                      Married1 These provisions  were added  In April, 1923..  in  response to suggestions  made  during the  passage  of  the Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1923.
            Married women living, with their husbands,    The            principle governing the rule that uncovenanted            benefit should not be paid to a married woman            living with her husband,  ie similar to that            applied to single persons residing with their            relatives i.e, if the husband is in employment            and the incomings are sufficient to enable the            wife to&apos; look to him for support without hardship,            the claim by the wife would be disallowed.  In            euch cases regard is paid not to the total            incomings of the household, e.g, the earnings            of adult children,  but only to the incomings            of the husband and the nismber of persons            dependent thereon.                    The similar rule  in respect of a married            man living with his wife  is only applied if            the wife is in definite employment,  and is            earning sufficient to justify the withholding            of benefit from the husband.&quot;          It will be recollected that ordinary benefit underthe scheme Is related to the payment  of contributions  and itis right that suoh benefit, to which  a man is legallyentitled,  should be paid irrespective of whether he needs itor not.   But when we come to the extraordinary temporaryarrangements introduced during the present prolonged un-employment crisis the position is quite different.  Por all practical purposes this uncovenantod  benefit is  a free giftto the unemployed person out of the contributions of those employed.   He has paid nothing to get it and although thepayment at present is debited against possible future  con*-tributions, the chances are that tha  debit will  never  be                                                 enforced
enforced either &quot;because it is  too great or,  more probably,owing to changes in the Bystem of correlating contributions and benefit whioh have been in contemplation for a year or so.          In these circumstances it is reasonable that theuncovenanted benefit should only go to persons who need it.          And this course is strongly indicated by considerations of the general finance of the UnemploymentScheme.     The Scheme is a contributory one and must remain so, for the State could not accept the whole charge,But it is nevertheless being &apos;sevsrely strained by the prolonged unemployment.     In spite of a very high rate of              s .d.contribution (l/7  a week for men), which we shall be pressed to reduce as soon as trade revives,  and in spite ofan  Exchequer grant on an exceptionally generous scalewhile the Eund is in deficit,  the Pund is in debt atthe moment to the tune of  14,000,000, notwithstanding these restrictions against indiscriminata rgrant,oftuncovenantedbenefit.   The additional wMKgpE&apos; charge^involved in ^the repeal of the restrictions set out above is  put at  2.000,000to  4,000,000 or more, all going to persons  who do not need it&apos;,  .          ThiB charge is hoavy^but it is small compared withthe amount which the Exchequer might find itself saddled withas a consequence of an assimilation of covenanted anduncovenanted benefit which tho minister  proposal bringsvery near.      Once that is done,  the contributory characterof the insurance scheme is practically obliterated and thetask of re-establishing it on  a proper financial footing will                                                   bo
be almost insuperable.         Finally,  I would, urge my colleagues to considerthe political aspect of the matter.-   Great play has  beenmade over the $aste of  money in &quot;doles&apos;  to  men who do not wish to work.   With the best administration in the worldone cannot prevent undesirable characters trading on  thecountry&apos;s generosity and incidentally I  should be very muchinterested to see  what  further measures  the Ministerproposee  to introduce to secure that  uncovenanted benefit is not given to a  person who is not genuinely &quot;seeking whole-time employment and unable to obtain  it.    Will not thesecases be  greatly multiplied and the public  outcry increased if we deliberately set  out to give money  to persona who do not need it?   The nation cannot afford  to waste money at the present time,                                         P.B.TREASURY,  S.W.      6th February.  1924,,
