                   PAST I.-INTRODTJCTOEY,    An examination of the Terms of Keference to the Sub-Gommittee, which !are given on the preceding page, reveals that the enquiry covers the following separate  but closely connected groups of questions:      (1) The co-operation and correlation between the  three Services           from the point of view of National and Imperial Defence           (see Part II).     (2) Their co-ordination, whether by means of a Ministry of Defence           or otherwise (see Part III).     (3) The relations of the Navy and Air Force as regards the control           of Fleet air work (see Part IV).     (4) The corresponding relations of the Army and Air Force (see           Part V).     (5) The standard to be aimed at for defining the strength of tip,           Air Force for purposes of Home and Imperial Defence (see           Part VI).    The whole of the  above questions were dealt  with, though  not inthe same order, by the Sub-Committee itself, which is hereafter referredto as the Committee  or the Main Committee, with the  one exceptionof item (3),  which  was remitted to a special Sub-Committee composedof-                         Lord Balfour,                         Lord Peel, and                         Lord Weir.   2. Between the 15th March and the 31st  October, the Main Com-mittee has held 19 meetings, in  addition to the  12 meetings of thespecial Sub-Committee, making a grand total of 31 meetings.  Theevidence of the Chiefs of Staff of the Fighting Services has been heardat great length on all the subjects discussed.  The special Sub-Com-mittee heard 16 witnesses.  No less than 67 Memoranda were furnished to the Main Committee and  19 to the Sub-Committee,  a total of  86Memoranda.   These include Memoranda on the question of a Ministryof Defence by the following authorites&quot; outside the Government service(see Part III) :-               Lord Midleton,               Lord Haldane,               Major-General Seely,               Sir Eric Geddes,               Field-Marshal Sir William Eobertson,               Lieut.-General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston,               Major-General Sir J. H. Davidson,               Major-General Sir Frederick Sykes.In addition, the Committee derived useful information from a reportcalled for by their  special Sub-Committee from Lieutenant-General sir charles Harington,   General  Officer  Conmianding-in-Chief,   allied forces in Occupation in Turkey.
   On  the  18th June, the Chairman, accompanied by the Secretaryof State for India and Lord Weir, received a  deputation from  theParliamentary Air Committee.  The deputation attended primarily with the object of presenting views on the question of the relations ofthe Navy and Air Force, but touched on many of the related questionswhich were before the Committee.PART  II-CO-OPEEATION  AND  CORRELATION   BETWEEN          THE THREE  SERVICES  FROM  THE  POINT  OF          VIEW  OF  NATIONAL AND IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.   3.  At the outset of the enquiry the Committee agreed that the term&quot; National  and Imperial  Defence &quot;  could  properly  be  defined  as&quot;Defence, of Territory  and Defence of Communications.&quot;  In orderto  establish the principles of co-operation and correlation between thethree Services from the point of view of National and Imperial Defence,it was found necessary  to make a careful  examination of the respon-sibilities of the three Services in this matter.      PRE-WAR RESPONSIBILITIES OP THE FIGHTING SERVICES.   4.  The main responsibilities of the Navy,  as they were regardedbefore the war, were set forth in a Memorandum by the Committee ofImperial Defence on the Principles of Imperial Defence in 1910 in thefollowing terms : .       &quot;The maintenance of sea supremacy has been assumed as the    basis of the system of Imperial Defence against attack from over the    sea.   This is the determining factor in shaping the whole defensive    policy of the Empire, and is fully recognised by the Admiralty,    who have  accepted the  responsibility  of  protecting all  British    territory abroad against organised invasion from the sea.&quot;   5.  The Army was responsible for dealing not with organised invasionfrom  the sea, which was a purely naval responsibility, but with suchraiding forces as might elude  the Fleet.  This responsibility included the general military defence of the United  Kingdom,  as well as theprovision  of fixed  defences and garrisons at Naval bases, Imperialcoaling stations and defended ports at home and abroad (other thanthose  in the Dominions and India).   The Army was also responsiblefor the provision of reinforcements for India in certain eventualities,for the defence of certain land frontiers, and for the maintenance of an expeditionary force to meet the military needs of the Empire, wherever they  might  arise.  This expeditionary force formed the nucleus  onwhich were built up the huge armies employed in the Great War.   6.  The Eoyal Air Force before the war was regarded as purelyancillary to the older Services, of which it formed a part.   It emerged from  the Great War as a separate Service under a separate Ministry.It is. essential, therefore,  to  the co-ordination of  Imperial defence that  the responsibilities of the new Service  should  be  very clearly defined and correlated with those of the sister Services.

    THE POST-WAR  RESPONSIBILITIES OP THE FIGHTING SERVICES.    7.  Considerable progress had been made before the commencement of the present enquiry in the direction of defining the post-war respon- sibilities of the three fighting Services.  The enquiry by Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s Sub-Committee on the Capital Ship (March, 1921), which heard much evidence as to  the  potentialities of the  air arm  at  sea, had resulted in the retention of the capital  ship as  the basis of our sea power.  The scope  of the enquiry, however,  did not extend to a  definition of tho respective responsibilities- of the Navy  and Air Force  in  regard  to operations at sea.    8.  The  Committee  of  Imperial  Defence had also  approved an arrangement made between the War Office and Air Ministry in regard to the responsibility for anti-aircraft defence, under which the Air Force was to be responsible for the control of anti-aircraft defences, the  War Office providing  the necessary personnel  and  materiel on the ground.    9.  Since the war, the Royal  Air Force has been given the respon- sibility for the security of the mandated territory of Iraq and Palestine.    10.  In addition,  on the 16th March, 1922, the following principles in regard to the co-operation of  the three Services were announced  in the House of Commons :      &quot; (i) That the Air Force must be autonomous in matters of admini-           stration and education ;                            I     &quot; (ii) That  in case  of  defence against air  raids, the Army  and           Navy must play a secondary role;     &quot; (iii) That in the case of military operations by land or naval           operations by sea,  the Air Force should  be in strict sub-           ordination to the General or Admiral in supreme command;           and lastly,     &quot; (iv) That in other cases (such as the protection of commerce, and           attack on enemy harbours and inland  towns) the relations           between  the  Air Force and the other  Services should be           regarded rather as a matter of co-operation than that of the           strict subordination which is necessary  when aeroplanes           are acting merely as auxiliaries to the  other arms.&quot;  (Par           liamentary Debates, March 16,  1922.)   11. In order to ascertain whether  the above  allocation of respon- sibilities  between  the three Services  required further readjustment, the Committee felt it necessary to make investigations into the stratc- psychological  basis of our system of National and Imperial Defence.   12. The most important result of this part of the enquiry was to confirm the vital need for a great increase in our air forces, which 1M 1 been established in  previous enquiries.   It soon  became clear, in only that the Air Force has an important part to play in the defence our home territory against sea-borne  attack  as  well  as  of  maritmcommunications in  waters adjacent to the British Islands,  but tinto provide protection against aerial attack a large aerial Home Defem
Force was required.   The question of the size of this force formed thesubject of an interim report to the Cabinet, and is dealt with in Part vi of this Report.  The adoption by the Government of the Committee&apos;srecommendations on this subject added to  the  responsibilities of theEoyal Air Force.   In other respects, however, it did not bear upon theproblem  of  co-operation and correlation  between the three Services,which  depends on those aspects  of National  and  Imperial  Defencewhere strategical or tactical co-operation between two or more  services is  required.   The  Committee therefore-enquired into these questions in considerable detail.   13. So far as the protection of territory and communications in the wider oceans is concerned, the  question of a readjustment of respon-sibilities  between the Service Departments did not  arise.  Althoughcertain types of aeroplanes have a radius of action up to 500-600 miles,and others up to 300-400 miles, neither the British nor any other AirService is yet  equipped with aeroplanes whose normal effective radius of action exceeds  about 200 miles, and beyond that distance  onlysea-borne aircraft have for the present to  be considered.   But it mustbe remembered that the types of aeroplanes now  in service use continuesteadily to be replaced by machines of greater power and wider radius of action.   Whatever the  arrangements for  the  organisation  and administration of the sea-borne air arm may be-a subject dealt within Part IV there  is no dispute that its operations must be controlled and directed by the same authority that controls and directs the otheroperations of  the  Fleet, namely,  the  Admiralty.   The  responsibilityof the  Admiralty,  therefore,  for the protection  of territory and corn-munications in great oceans was not challenged.   14.  In the  narrow  seas, however, Imperial territory  and com-munications are evidently liable to attack,  not only by surface craft and submarines, but also by  aircraft., in so far as they are within theradius  of action of  aircraft  operating  from foreign  territory.   TheCommittee therefore found it necessary to enquire how far the.powerof the  Navy to  protect territory and  communications in the narrowseas is affected by modern developments  of naval and aerial  warfare.   15. So far  as territory is concerned, it is satisfactory to be able to record that  the  three General Staffs are agreed that in existing con-ditions the liability of the United Kingdom to  sea-borne invasion ascompared with the years preceding the war is negligible.            ,   16. Another matter on which some measure of agreement was foundto exist between the Naval Staff and the Air Staff is in  regard to theincreased risks to communications in those portions of the narrow seaswhich  are exposed to attack by aircraft  operating from shore bases,such as  the English Channel  and the Mediterranean.   Both Staffsadmit that the advent of aircraft has increased the danger to communi-cations in such waters, though they differ as to the extent of this danger.   17. Apart  from this, when the Committee  came to  examine thequestion of  the protection of maritime communications in the narrowseas, they did not find the same  measure of agreement between theStalls  which they had  met  with  in regard  to  tho  protection of the    (B 34-954)Q                                           A 4.
 territory of trie Mother  country.&apos;  On  the  contrary, this  part of the enquiry revealed wide differences of professional opinion between the Naval Staff and the Air  Staff, both in matters of principle and detail, on such questions as the power  of a fleet to operate within effective striking range of hostile aircraft, the effectiveness of. attacks  on a fleet by aircraft and the power of a fleet to defend itself against such attacks, the defence of naval bases against aircraft attack and the protection of certain portions of our trade routes.   The more closely the enquiry was pressed in matters of detail  the wider these differences  appeared.    In the  course of this enquiry frequent  appeals were made to the experience of the war in support of both sides of the various contro- versies,  and the Committee obtained independent historical evidence from the.Historical Section.  The conditions of the late  war, however, are not necessarily applicable to future wars, particularly in view of the potentialities of development in aircraft.    In the  light of present knowledge the Committee did not feel com- petent to form an opinion on the  difficult technical questions on which the General Staffs take different views.  They felt that, apart from the provision of an  adequate Air Defence  Force, which is  dealt with in Part VI of this Eeport, the most useful service they could render at the moment was to devise machinery for securing the smooth co-operation of the three Services, notwithstanding  the  differences of  professional opinion, and for gradually building up. a doctrine common to the three Services,   This part of the terms  of reference is dealt with in Part III of this Report.   &quot;While the Committee do not put forward  any sugges- tion to change the existing &quot;division of responsibility between the three Services as described in paragraph  10,  they  recommend  that  the responsibilities of the Navy and the Air Force in regard to the protection of communications in the narrow  seas should form the subject  of further investigation.  They also consider that experiment in respect of the problems of air  attack and defence at sea should be given  due weight in Admiralty and Air Ministry programmes, in order to  secure on the basis of practical experience the fullest measure of unity of professional opinion.    18. Before leaving the question of the co-operation and correlation between the three Services, the Committee desire to draw attention to the views of Lieutenant-general sir Charles Harington on the subject. which were formed  as the result  of his  experience in command of the*Ulied Forces of Occupation at Constantinople,  These views illustrate and confirm the soundness of the principles approved by the Cabinet in March, 1922 (paragraph  10).   General  Harington suggests &quot; that the principle should be  laid down that the &apos; predominant  partner&apos;  co- ordinates and the other Services  should conform in exactly  the same loyal way in which Admirals de Robeck and Brock both officers senior to me have helped  me.&quot;  While the  Committee are  not  prepared to recommend without further technical  examination that this principle should be adopted in the settlement of all military problems  in which more than  one Service is concerned, they consider that it is worthy of the most serious consideration and should be examined by the new Com- mifctee, of Chiefs of Staff referred to later in this Report (paragraph 36).
CONGLUSIONS.   19.  The conclusions of the Committee in regard to this part of the report  may be summed up as follows :-    (a)  While the Committee  do not put forward any suggestion to          change the  existing division of responsibility between the          three Services as described in paragraph 10, they recommend          that the responsibilities of the Navy and the Air Force in          regard to the protection  of  communications in the narrow          seas should  form the subject of further investigation.  The          Committee further  recommend that experiment in respect          of the  problems of air attack and defence at sea  should be          given  due  weight  in Admiralty  and  Air Ministry pro-          grammes, in order to secure on the basis of practical experi-          ence the fullest measure of unity of professional opinion.    (6)  The principal need, as regards co-operation and correlation, is          closer co-ordination, which is dealt with in Part III of this          Eeport.    (c)  The principle that in all belligerent operations in which more          than one Service is concerned one of  the three Services          should  be  selected as a &quot; predominant  partner &quot;  to co-          ordinate the  other Services should be examined by the          Committee of Chiefs of Staffs.    (d) While the menace of attack from the air has greatly increased          and necessitates a strong Home Defence Air Force as pro-          posed in Part VI of this Eeport, the three Staffs are agreed          that in existing conditions  the liability of the country to          sea-borne invasion has considerably diminished as compared          with pre-war standards.                 Part III-CO-ORDINATION.                    A Ministry, as Defence.   20.  Since  the  war the most widely-discussed  proposal for over-coming our defects  in co-ordination is a Ministry of Defence,  whichhas been put  forward repeatedly both in Parliament and in the  Press.In 1922 Sir Eric Geddes&apos; Committee on National Expenditure recom-niended &quot;the creation of a Co-ordinating Authority or  a  Ministry ofDefence responsible for  seeing that each force plays its part and isallotted appropriate responsibility for carrying out  various functions.&quot;A Cabinet Committee, which reviewed the Geddes Eeport, endorsed the&apos; above recommendation, but, while admitting the  creation of aMinistry of Defence may be the ultimate solution of the problem, did  not consider that the present time is appropriate for the fusion of theadministration  of the  three  Services under  one Minister.&quot;  they recommended instead &quot; that the Committee of Imperial Defence shouldbe in constant session all the year round in order to  consider and advise on matters of policy affecting the three fighting Services.&quot;  On  the21st March, 1922, the late Secretary of State for the  Colonies (Mr!Churchill), during a debate in the House of Commons, made an important    (b 34-954)0,                                           a  5   &apos;
speech, in favour of a Ministry of Defence as the ultimate solution ofour problems of co-ordination, though he admitted that the time foraccomplishing this had not arrived.  The gist is contained in the finalpassages:         &quot;No solution.of a harmonious or symmetrical character will    be achieved in  the  co-ordination of the Services except through    the agency of a Ministry of Defence, but it is not possible to create    such a body at the present time, nor will it be possible for a con-    siderable time.  In the interim the only steps which are open to    us are to create machinery for pooling the administrative functions    of the three arms and to create a common staff brain, from whose    exertions in the future the responsible advice given to the Cabinet    of the day in regard to matters  of defence  must and can only    effectively originate.&quot;    21.  The interim steps referred to by Mr. Churchill were the appoint-ment of a Committee, under Sir Alfred Mond, whose place was latertaken  by Lord Weir,  to  consider  the  amalgamation of the common services of the Navy, Army  and Air Force, and, later, of a Sub-Com-mittee  of the Committee of Imperial Defence under the  Minister ofEducation, on the question of establishing a joint Staff College for thethree Services.  Lord Weir&apos;s  Committee reported that &quot; the  amalga-mation of the common services would only be practicable if it formed part of a comprehensive scheme of reorganisation which provided forthe establishment  of a Ministry to control a defence force in which the identity of the Navy, Army  and Air Force had been merged.&quot;  they recommended,  however,  a complete  scheme  for co-ordinating thecommon services, which has since  been adopted by the Cabinet and isbeing  put in operation.   The report of Mr. Wood&apos;s  Committee, pro-posing a scheme for the formation of a Joint  Staff College, has been circulated to this Committee and is  now before the Committee ofImperial Defence. .    22. In view of the uncertainty as to what is meant by the  term&quot; Ministry of Defence,&quot; the Committee thought it desirable to approachsome of those who have advocated this solution of the problem of co-ordination, as  well as other  outside authorities,  in order to ascertaintheir views on the subject.  Among the outside experts who were goodenough to give the  Committee the benefit of their experience on thissubject, there were only two advocates of a Ministry of Defence, and each  of them contemplated  its formation by different methods.  sir eric G-eddes proposed to achieve  co-ordination of the Services by thecreation of a single  Secretary of State for &quot; Warfare &quot; or  &quot; Defence,with  responsibility  for the  three  Services.  Under  the Secretary ofState  he would put  the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, eachof which would be under a Sub-Minister.  These Sub-Ministers shouldnot be eligible for Cabinet rank, as that would make  for departmentalcompetition between them.  Among themselves they would be equalin importance and would bear the same relation to the Secretary of state as a Parliamentary Under Secretary holds to his Ministerial chief to-day.The Sub-Ministers would preside respectively at the Board of Admiralty,Army Council and Air Council, which  would remain more or less  as at
present.  The Seoretary of State would have a very small office, con-taining a Statistical Accountant and a Council consisting of the Sub-Ministers of the Navy, Army and Air Force, with two members eachfrom the Board  of Admiralty, Army Council and Air Council.   TheSecretary of State would have to obtain the endorsement of the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence  &quot; before his estimates and his provisionswere taken  to the  Cabinet.&quot;  Sir Eric Geddes added  proposals fororganisation after the outbreak of war, which it is unnecessary to enterinto here.   23. Major-General  Sir Frederick. Sykes  advocated a Ministry ofDefence by means of a form of fusion or amalgamation of the existing service  departments.   He considered that &quot;the real solution lies indefinite, unified, supreme control by a Defence Ministry, with the PrimeMinister as independent Chairman, and a joint Staff which would reallythink out defence as  a whole.&quot;  Failing this policy of  perfection,General Sykes would &quot; support every measure which will pave the way for such control.&quot; . He would achieve this by &quot; the real strengthening of the mandate and constitution of the Committee of Imperial Defence.In his view, the  Committee should frame estimates for defence for thethree Services, and a special section should be formed for the specificpurpose of jointly framing and supervising major schemes and measuresof defence.   As  many Services  as  possible should be  unified.   the personnel of the  regular arms should be trained from boyhood.  Thereshould be a joint boy-mechanic training, a joint Cadet College, a joint staff course, &amp;c.   The question  of  the amalgamation of similarServices should be reopened.&quot;   24. The proposals of the remaining  outside authorities had many points in common.  They all laid stress on the need for co-ordination.They all proposed that this co-ordination should be effected through theCommittee  of Imperial  Defence.   They  nearly  all  admitted, either directly or by implication, that the work of directing the Committeewas too heavy for the Prime Minister to undertake single-handed andthat he should have  the assistance  of a  Minister, as Vice-Chairman,who could give most of his time to this task. Several laid stress onthe importance of securing  the co-operation of the Dominions in theCommittee of Imperial Defence.    25. In detail, the proposals  varied considerably.   Lord Midleton and Lord Haldane did not indicate any particular  developments of the existing Committee of Imperial Defence, the case for which was summed up by the latter in the following terms :         &quot; The Committee of Imperial Defence is  an organisation that     has nothing quite resembling it in any other country.   The reason     is that  no  other  nation resembles the British  Empire, with its     Island centre for  a number of countries, some of which are self-     governing, and all of which are united by unwritten and elastic     obligations.  We have evolved this Committee to meet Dominion     as well as  Home necessities,  and to  meet  the former it  is far     better adapted than any  special Ministry of Defence could be.
    .....  But  a still more distinctive feature of the existing    organisation is that it has been evolved to meet a situation where    sea power comes first and where the other two Services are, in    some measure, merely its adjuncts, however great and important.    That is  why  the scope of the  Committee must be sufficiently    catholic  to  admit of the co-operation within it of  distinguished    experts at the head of very different Services.&quot;   The above extract was  specifically endorsed by  the  Chief of theImperial General Staff.   26. Major-General  Seely, Field-Marshal  Sir William  Robertson,Major-General Sir J. H. Davidson, M.P., and Lieut.-General Sir AylmerHunter-Weston, M.P., all advocated  definite extensions of the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence organisation, which resembled one another in principle while differing in detail.   27. General Seely&apos;s principal proposal was  &quot; that a Minister mustbe appointed, under whatever title be deemed expedient, whose soleduty it will be to secure the co-operation of the three Services, reportingfully  to  the  Prime Minister  and  the  Cabinet.   I  suggest that  heshould be styled &apos; Minister of  Defence and Vice-President of the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence.&apos; &quot;   General Seely strongly advocated theretention of the civilian heads of the three Service Departments in theirexisting  status  as  members  of the  Cabinet.  &quot; Great  government offices,&quot;  he writes, &quot; cannot possibly be controlled efficiently by any man without Cabinet rank.  I am sure that anyone who has had experi-ence of Great Government Offices would agree with this view.&quot;   28. Field-Marshal Sir William Robertson&apos;s  proposals  are sum-marised in his Memorandum as follows :     &quot; (a) Neither  a  Ministry of Defence nor  a  combined Imperial           General Staff  will provide, or help  to  provide,  the  co-           ordinating authority we  require.    &quot; (6) Controlling  authority, in  its true meaning, must  be vested           in the supreme executive power, the Cabinet, and it cannot           be placed elsewhere.    &quot; (c) Experience has  shown that we cannot conduct  a  great war       I!    through the medium of a Cabinet of twenty or more Minis-       i    ters,  and  that the duty  is  best assigned to a small body of           Ministers having no  other duties to perform.  As this           organisation is not feasible in peace time, its place should           be taken by a Council of Imperial Defence, which will form           a  nucleus for war.    &quot; (d) In  order to furnish this Council with the professional assist-           ance  needed, there should be, working under it, a Technical           Committee, charged with the investigation of all operative           and administrative  questions, and  with  presenting them,           with recommendations thereon, to the Council for considera-           tion and approval.    &quot; (e)  In time of war a Minister of Supply and a Minister  of Man-           power should be appointed and a War Cabinet  should be          formed.   The  latter,  assisted  and  advised  by  the  three           Chiefs of  Staff, would take over the duties in (c) and (d).
    &quot; (/) Every effort should be made to enlist the co-operation of the          Dominions,  both as to State policy and war preparations.&quot;   29. The followifig details of Sir William.Robertson&apos;s plan may beadded.  The Committee would be composed very much as heretofore.In addition:        &quot; The Prime Minister would, of course, be President. . It would    be the duty of the three Chiefs of Staff to advise the Council on    professional matters, the advice to be taken or left as Ministers    may think best, but to be heard.  These officers should,  as was    the War Cabinet system, attend the Council in an advisory capacity    and not as members.   I believe this procedure to be the best for    both parties.   Following the pre-war constitution of the Committee    of Imperial Defence, a senior officer from each of the three Services    should be  included in the Council as members.  Their experience    would enable them to give valuable help both to Ministers and the    Chiefs of Staff, and they would be specially useful to the former in    cases where the  latter might feel compelled to differ from each    other in  regard  to professional  matters upon which they were    called upon to advise.  If these  three officers (unemployed) are    not included in the Council, Ministers will have to decide for them-    selves professional  questions about which their knowledge  must    necessarily be imperfect, and the soundness of their decisions will,    therefore, remain largely a matter of chance.&quot;   30. Major-General Sir J. H. Davidson, M.P., referred the Committeeto an article published by him in the Army Quarterly of January, 1921,in which he advocated a plan presented to the Government  by theParliamentary  Army Committee in June,  1920, the essentials of whichare contained in the following extract from a Minute addressed by theCommittee to the  Prime Minister (Mr.  Lloyd George):        &quot; 4. It  is  possible  that the  most practicable  scheme  under    present conditions would be to create immediately a Standing    Joint Defence  Sub-Committee  of the Committee  of  Imperial    Defence,  formed of the  First Sea Lord,  the C.I.G.S.,  and the    C.A.S., or officers  appointed or deputed by them, together with&quot;    representatives of  the  Self-Governing Dominions, of India,  and    of other Departments concerned.       &quot; 5. Whatever be the Advisory Body formed, the members of    the Army Committee in the House of Commons are of opinion that    it is essential:           &quot; (I) That it should meet regularly and frequently.         &quot; (II) That it should have a specially selected and permanent               Secretariat to assist in its work,  and to record its pro-               ceedings and conclusions.        &quot; (III) That the Chairman  of this Sub-Committee should be               a Minister  not in charge of one of  the Great Depart-               ments of State, except on those occasions when the               Prime Minister is himself present.
         &quot;6. Among the duties  of the&quot; Standing Joint Defence Sub-      Committee of  the  C.I.D., shotild be included  the following:          &quot; To examine-          &quot;  (a) The Imperial Organisation for Defence.          &quot;  (b) The  Estimates, in draft, with a view to ensuring due                economy and efficiency.          &quot;  (c) Our Imperial responsibilities from the point of view of                Defence.          &quot;  (d) The effect of scientific progress and inventions.          &quot;  (e) Tho problems of Strategy and Logistics.          &quot; (/) The proposals of the League of Nations.&quot;    31. Lieut-General  Sir  Aylmer   Hunter-Weston,   M.P.,  was  a signatory of  the Minute of the  Parliamentary  Army  Committee referred  to above,  and his  Memorandum gives a  carefully thought- out  scheme  for  applying the  principles propounded therein.  He recommended the  retention of the  present Committee of Imperial Defence with the  title of Council of Imperial Defence, under the Chair- manship of the Prime Minister, with the Lord President of the Council as Vice-Chairman.  In  addition, he proposed the establishment of a Board of Defence, composed of the Ministerial and professional heads of the three Fighting Services, with a representative of the Treasury, meeting under the Chairmanship of the Vice-Chairman of the  Council of Defence, who might with advantage be called Minister of Defence. The  Chairman should have power of initiative in all matters of strategy, policy, and finance  affecting more than one  Service.  The  duties pro- posed for this &quot; Board of Defence &quot; under its Chairman are  similar in character to those suggested by the Parliamentary Army  Committee for the Standing Joint Defence Sub-Committee, but  worked  out in greater detail.    32. An essential part of General Hunter-Weston&apos;s plan was that the Council of  Imperial Defence should  function actively and  regularly, and that the Dominions and India should be represented at its meetings. He advocated that, as no one man can fulfil the functions  of Chief of&quot;the General War  Staff of our Defence Forces, the office should  be put in commission and  carried out by the professonal heads of the three Services sitting together in Committee.    33. In the view of the Committee the proposals for a  Minister of Defence are effectually disposed  of in the following passage from Lord Haldane&apos;s Memorandum :          &quot; In the way of the institution of a general Minister of Defence      there are obvious difficulties.   If established with anything like      adequate  power of control,  such a Minister would be bound to     interfere in administration, just as the First Lord of the Admiralty      and the Secretary of State  for War are  bound  to  be ready to do     so, by  reason of  their direct responsibility for it  to Parliament.     The Minister  of Defence would, indeed, be looked to as responsible     not only for efficiency, but for economy.  He would therefore
   require a considerable and varied staff, whose duties would overlap   and duplicate those of existing departmental staffs.  What would   be  the relation of this new staff to the staffs under the three   Ministers at present responsible to Parliament, and what would   be the constitutional and practical relationship of the new Minister   of Defence  to the three older Ministers ?   The former would,  I   think, be in considerable danger of proving himself to  be either   too great or too little.   He would be too little if the departmental   staffs developed to their full inherent capacity and were working   out general military policy  in conference.   In such  a case  the   Prime Minister would be the only person possessed of authority   sufficient to enable him to intervene effectively.       &quot; With the Cabinet behind him, he is in a position to exercise   influence as no Minister of Defence could.       &quot; If, indeed, the Minister of Defence were to make  himself, on   the other hand, very powerful by equipping himself with an effec-   tive administrative organisation sufficient for direct control of the   three Services, he  might well become  a rival of the Prime Minister   himself.   The  difficulty does not exhaust itself here.   The first   Government  that made  such an  appointment  would  probably   make  it with great care  and with sufficient regard to necessary   qualifications in the occupant of the position.  But if a subsequent   Government came in that were not deeply interested  in defence,   the temptation would be strong to give the office to an influential   politician distinguished, perhaps,  mainly for debating gifts.&quot;   34. To  these objections may be added  the following,  urged by LordMidleton:        &quot; It is surely beyond human power for one man to get his mind   impregnated  with the pros  and cons of large changes in three   totally distinct Services within the limited time for which Parlia-   mentary Chiefs hold office.   The fact that there have been eleven   changes in the Office of Secretary of State for War  in the  last   eleven years has been very prejudicial to the economy and possibly   to  the efficiency  of the Army.  First  Lords of the  Admiralty    attach the greatest importance to their official tours for elucidating    by contact with Naval Officers not  employed at  the  Admiralty    the problems  submitted  to  them.  The overworked  Minister of    Defence would be quite unable to find time for such excursions.       &quot; A further difficulty would be the Parliamentary one, since it    is often necessary for the Minister in charge to give a pledge during    a debate as to the course which his  Department will take.   Not    infrequently it has happened that by far the most efficient Head    of the Defence Committee  would be a  Member of the House of    Lords ;.............................&apos;  If the    supreme executive responsibility of all three Departments were to    be massed in one Minister it would be imperative  that he should    sit in the House of Commons, and attendance in the House of Com-    mons would add immeasurably to the already multifarious duties    imposed on him,&quot;
   require a considerable and varied staff, whose duties would overlap   and duplicate those of existing departmental staffs.  What would   be  the relation of  this new staff to the staffs under  the three   Ministers at present responsible to Parliament, and what would   be the constitutional and practical relationship of the new Minister   of Defence  to  the three older Ministers ?   The former would,  I   think, be in considerable danger of proving himself to be either   too great or too little.   He would be too little  if the departmental   staffs developed to  their full inherent capacity and were working   out general  military policy  in conference.  In such a case the   Prime Minister would be the only  person possessed of  authority   sufficient to enable him to intervene effectively.       &quot; With the  Cabinet behind him, he is in a  position to exercise   influence as no Minister of Defence  could.       &quot; If, indeed, the Minister of Defence were to make himself, on   the other hand, very powerful by equipping himself with an effec-   tive administrative organisation sufficient for direct control of the   three Services,  he might well become a rival of the Prime Minister   himself.   The  difficulty does not exhaust itself  here.  The first   Government that made  such an  appointment  would probably   make  it with great care  and with sufficient regard to  necessary   qualifications in the occupant of the position.  But if a subsequent   Government came in that were not deeply  interested in defence,   the temptation would  be strong to give the office  to an influential   politician distinguished, perhaps, mainly for  debating  gifts.&quot;   34. To these objections may be added the following, urged by LordMidleton:        &quot; It is surely beyond human power for one man to get his mind   impregnated with the pros  and  cons of large changes in three   totally distinct Services within the  limited time for which Parlia-   mentary Chiefs hold office.   The  fact that there have been eleven   changes in  the Office of Secretary of State for  War in the last   eleven years has been very prejudicial to the economy and possibly    to  the efficiency of  the Army.  Pirst  Lords of the Admiralty    attach the greatest importance to their official tours for elucidating    by contact with Naval Officers not employed at the Admiralty    the problems submitted  to  them.   The overworked Minister  of    Defence would be quite unable to  find time for  such excursions.       &quot; A further difficulty would be the Parliamentary one, since  it    is often necessary for the Minister in charge to give a pledge during    a debate as to the course which his Department will take.  Not    infrequently it has happened that by far the  most efficient Head    of the Defence Committee  would be a  Member  of the House of    Lords;............................   If the    supreme executive responsibility  of all three Departments were to    be massed in one Minister it would be imperative that he should    sit in the House of Commons, and attendance in the House of Com-    mons would add immeasurably to the already multifarious duties    imposed on him,&quot;
   35. The closely-connected question of a combined Staff is disposedof equally effectively by Field-Marshal Sir William Eobertson in thefollowing terms : .        &quot; The formation of a combined  Imperial  General Staff, con-    sisting of Military, Naval and Air Force officers, working under a    Chief (a soldier,  or sailor, or airman) responsible to  the government-    ment, or to a Minister of Defence, for working out plans of opera-    tions on  land, on sea, and in the air, and,  according  to some,    endowed  with &apos; financial and strategical  powers,&apos;  is even more    fantastical as  well as  dreadfully  mischievous.   An important    corner-stone  in military organisation is that he who makes a plan    ought to be responsible for its execution and stake  his reputation    upon it.   Consequently, the Chief of this proposed combined Staff    must draft and  issue the  orders of the  Government to all the    Generals and Admirals and Air Officers entrusted with the control    of the armies,  the fleets and the air forces.   The confusion that    would arise in the three War Departments and at the  front, if any    such  ill-considered system  as this were adopted, is  quite incon-    ceivable.  Further, this Staff would directly interpose between the    three Chiefs  of Staff and the Cabinet, and there could be no more    pernicious system than that.&quot;   36. The Committee considered these criticisms to be overwhelmingas against all proposals for setting up a Ministry of Defence or any minister of  Defence with  authority overriding  that of the  ministers at the head of the Service Departments, or a combined Staff. after careful consideration of the various proposals laid before them, after afull discussion with the Chiefs of Staffs of the  three Fighting Services,and after a  close  examination  of  the  constitution and  the presentmethods of work of the Committee of  Imperial  Defence,  the Com-mittee reached the following conclusions, which were adopted by theGovernment and presented to Parliament in August last (Cmd. 1938):        &quot; (1) It  is  undesirable  and impracticable to  supersede the    Ministerial heads of the three Fighting. Services by making them    subordinates of a Minister  of Defence ;  the alternative plan for    an amalgamation of  the  three Service  Departments is equally    impracticable.        &quot; (2)  On the other  hand, the existing  system of co-ordination    by the Committee of Imperial Defence is not sufficient  to secure    full initiative and responsibility for defence as a whole and requires    to  be defined and strengthened.      .:&quot; (3)  Under the existing system the  Committee of Imperial    Defence, an advisory  and  consultative body, enquires  into and    makes recommendations in regard to the issues of defence policy     and  organisation  which are  brought before it.   The  power of    initiative lies  with the Government Departments  and  with the     Prime Minister.        &quot; (4)  This system, though invaluable up to a point, does not    make any authority, except the Prime Minister,  who  can only    devote a small part of his time and attention to defence  questions,     directly responsible for the initiation of a consistent line of policy
directing tire common action of the three or any two of the three services, taking account of the reactions of the three Services uponone another.   &quot; (5)  While,  therefore,  the existing system of departmentalinitiative will continue, the responsibility for the wider initiativereferred to above in paragraph (4) will also rest with the Chairmanof the Committee of Imperial Defence acting  under  the general direction of  the  Committee of  Imperial  Defence and with theassistance of the three  Chiefs of Staff.   &quot; (6)  In accordance with the terms of the Treasury Minute  ofthe 4th May, 1904, constituting the Committee of Imperial defence in its present form, the Committee of Imperial Defence  will con-tinue to consist of the Prime Minister,  as  President, with such other members as, having regard to the nature of the subject  tobe discussed, he may from time to time  summon to assist him.In pursuance of a decision  by the Prime Minister, the Committeeplaces on record that the following should be members :     &quot; The Chairman (Deputy to the Prime Minister).    &quot; The Secretary of State for War.    &quot; The Secretary of State for Air.    &quot; The Pirst Lord of the Admiralty.    &quot; The Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the financial Secretary.    &quot; The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    &quot; The Secretary of State for the Colonies.    &quot; The Secretary of State for India.    &quot; The Chiefs of Staff of the three Fighting Services.    &quot; The Permanent  Secretary  to the Treasury as head of the          Civil Service.In addition  to these, other British or Dominion Ministers of theCrown and other officials, or persons having special qualifications,will be summoned as members by the President according to thenature of the business.                     -   &quot; (7)  The functions of  the  Chairman of the Committee  ofImperial Defence will be       &quot; (i) To preside over  the Committee of Imperial Defence  in          the absence of the Prime Minister.     &quot; (ii) To report to the Prime Minister  (when he  himself has          not  presided) and to the  Cabinet  the recommenda-          tions of the Committee of Imperial Defence.    &quot; (iii) In matters of detail,  to interpret the decisions of the          Prime  Minister  and  the  Cabinet  thereupon to the          Departments concerned.    &quot; (iv) Assisted by the  three  Chiefs of Staff,  as laid down  in          paragraph (5) above, to keep the  defence situation as a          whole constantly under review so  as to ensure that          defence preparations and plans  and the expenditure          thereupon  are   co-ordinated   and  framed  to  meet          policy, that full  information as to the changing naval,          military and air situation may always be available  to
                the Committee of Imperial Defence and that resolu-                tions  as to the  requisite action thereupon  may be                submitted for its  consideration.         &quot; (8) In addition to the functions of the Chiefs  of  Staff as     advisers on questions of  sea, land or air policy respectively, to     their own Board or Council,  each of the three Chiefs of Staff will     have an individual and collective responsibility for advising on     defence policy, as a whole,  the three  constituting, as it were, a     Super-Chief of a War Staff in Commission.  In carrying  out this     function they will  meet together  for the discussion of questions     which affect their joint responsibilities.         &quot; (9) Questions  relating to co-ordination of expenditure  may     be  entertained by the Committee  of Imperial Defence when re-     ferred  to it  by the  Cabinet.  The  Committee  (subject  to  any     directions by the Cabinet) will consider such questions in the  light     of the  general defence policy of  the Government, and  of the     strategical plans drawn up to give effect to that policy in time of     war.        &quot; (10) The Secretariat of  the Committee  of Imperial Defence     will continue to act  as liaison officers between the Chairman of the     Committee and the  Service Departments.  The staff of the Com-     mittee  will  be strengthened by  the addition of  an Assistant     Secretary to be nominated by the  Prime Minister on  the recom-     mendation of the Secretary of State for Air, whose status will be     identical with that  of the   three  existing  Assistant  Spcretaries     nominated by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of  the     Seoretary of State for War, the Secretary of  State for India,  and     the First Lord of the Admiralty.        &quot; (11) The Standing Defence Sub-Committee  is suppressed,     and its  past proceedings will be merged into those  of the Com-     mittee of Imperial Defence.&quot;     The above recommendations are now in operation.       THE REPRESENTATION OE  THE DOMINIONS AND INDIA.     37.  There is one point in the above conclusions on which the Com-mittee, in this their final Report, would like to add a few observations,namely,  regarding the provision in Conclusion (6)  for the extension ofinvitations to representatives of the Dominions to attend as membersof the Committee.  Prom  the earliest  days of the  Committee ofImperial Defence,&apos; representatives of  the  Dominions have  from timeto time been invited to take part  in its proceedings, and the Secretaryof State  for India has for many years attended its meetings.   38. The subject of Dominion representation was discussed  at  theCommittee in May, 1911, when all  the Dominions were representedand the following resolution was passed :        &quot;  That one or more representatives appointed by the respei    tive  Governments of the Dominions should be invited to  attend
    meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence, when questions    of naval and. military defence affecting the  Overseas dominions    are under consideration.&quot;   39. Before the war every effort was made to give  effect to theabove resolution by taking advantage  of the presence in this country of representatives of the Dominions, to invite them, with the concur-rence  of  their own Governments, to the meetings of the  Committeeand of its Sub-Committees.   Since the war no such opportunities have offered, though in fact many of the meetings of the Imperial Conference,1921,  were  analogous  to  meetings of  the Committee of  ImperialDefence ; those present included the regular members of the Committee,the  subjects were mainly those which naturally fall to the Committee,and the secretarial work was supplied by the  Committee in co-operationwith the Colonial  Office, the Dominions  and India.*  Moreover, bothbefore and since the war the Dominions and India have been furnished with many of the Reports of the Committee  of Imperial Defence.   PART  IV.-THE  RELATIONS  OF  THE  NAVY AND THE AIR                         &apos;  .    FORCE.   .   40.  The question of the relations  of the Navy and the Air Force   in  regard to fleet air work had already been the subject of acute and   prolonged controversy, and was recognised to require investigation of   a detailed character.   As already mentioned,  therefore,  this  question   was referred to a special Sub-Committee composed of : -               Lord Balfour.               Lord Peel.               Lord Weir.      Their Report,  together with the remarks  of the main Committeei   thereon, were adopted by the  Government, and presented to Parlia-   ment last August.  (Cmd. 1938.)  These Reports are annexed to thisI   Report for convenience of reference.   PART V.-THE RELATIONS OF  THE  ARMY AND THE AIE                               FORCE.      41. The question of the relations of the Army and the Air Force   formed  the  subject of an Interim Report by the Chairman to the   Cabinet, dated the 30th June, 1923, the effective portions of whioh are  contained in the following extracts :            &quot; The  Secretary of State for War  recently circulated to the        Sub-Committee  a  Memorandum  by.the  General Staff on this        question.....      * Note by  the Clmirman. This is equally true of the Imperial Conference,   1923. The question of defence was discussed by the plenary conference at great   length, and in  similar conditions to those mentioned in  this Eeport.  In   addition, important discussions took place at the Admiralty and Air Ministry.   (ice  the Official Summary of the proceedings  of  the Imperial Conference,   Cmd. 1987.)                                        -              &apos;
        &quot; Tlie views oi the  General  Stall are contained in Part I of     that Memorandum, and are summarised on p. 4 in the following     terms i          &quot; &apos; (a) The air.units, which are an integral part of the Fleet               and Air formations  (including probably Iighter-than-               air  formations) capable of co-operating with the Fleet               on the high seas, to be under the Admiralty.         &quot; &apos; (6) The air units, which are an integral part of Army forma-              ,. tions and  Air formations required to co-operate with               the Army  (including  Air Porces allotted to the general               pool for war and to home defence), to be under the War               Office.         &quot; &apos; (c) Civil aviation, research,  experiment and supply to be               under the  Air Ministry, which, relieved of all responsi-               bility for the employment of Air Porces in peace and               war, could be much reduced.                  &quot; &apos; Each of the three Departments (Naval, Military               and Civil)  would estimate for its own air requirements,               the whole being co-ordinated  by the Committee of               Imperial Defence before presentation to Parliament.&apos;        &quot; The view of the Sub-Committee was to  the effect that the     above distribution of responsibility was unsatisfactory, and that if     the Air Porces  of this country were to be developed to the utmost     it was necessary to  retain the  Royal Air Force as  a separate     Service, and that progress would not be so great if the War Office     proposals were adopted.  The conclusion of  the Sub-Committee     was             &quot; &apos; That they  were unable to accept the views expressed         by the General Staff in Part I of their Paper.&apos; &quot;   The Secretary of  State for. War, while  strongly supporting theGeneral Staff  solution, expressed the readiness of  the War Office toco-operate in furthering the  scheme as accepted.   The Cabinet adopted the  above Eeport on the 9th July and con-firmed1 the present  arrangement under which the Royal Air Force is administered by the Air Ministry as a separate Department of State.PART  VI.-THE  STEENGTH OF  THE  EOYAL AIR  FORCE.   42. The last item in the Terms of Reference is  the standard to heaimed at for defining the strength of the Air Force for purposes of Homeand Imperial Defence..   43. This  question was  dealt with  in an Interim Report, dated the12th June, 1923.   This Report was approved by the Cabinet on the 20th June, 1923,and  the  following announcement of the Governments policy basedthereon was made in both  Houses of Parliament on the same date :-       &quot;The Government have  come  to  the following conclusions    with reference to British Air power :-       &quot; In addition to meeting the  essential Air  power requirements    of the  Navy, Army,  Indian and Overseas commitments, British
   Air power must include a Home Defence Air Force of sufficient   strength adequately  to protect us  against  Air attack by the   strongest Air Force within striking distance of this country.      &quot; It should be organised in part on a regular and permanent   military basis, and in part on a territorial or reserve basis, but so   arranged as to ensure that sufficient strength will be immediately   available for purposes of defence.  The fullest possible&apos;use to be   made of civilian labour and facilities.      &quot; In the first instance, the Home Defence Force should consist   of 52 squadrons, to be created with as little delay as possible, and   the Secretary of State for  Air  has been instructed forthwith to   take the preliminary steps for carrying this  decision into  effect.   The result of this proposal will be to add 34 squadrons to the   authorised strength of  the  Royal Air Force.  The details  of the   organisation will be arranged with a view to the possibility of   subsequent expansion, but before any further development is put   in hand the question  should be re-examined in the light  of the   then Air strength of foreign Powers.      &quot; In conformity with our obligation under the Covenant of the   League  of Nations,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government would  gladly   co-operate with other Governments in limiting the strength of air   armaments on lines similar to the Treaty  of Washington  in the   case of the Navy, and any such arrangements, it is needless to   say, would govern the policy  of  air expansion set  out in this   statement.&quot;   (Parliamentary Debates, 26th June, 1923.)   44. In  order to arrive at the total standard of strength for theRoyal Air Force, it is necessary to add to the forces for Home defence the strength of:    Royal Air Force Units serving with the Navy.   The Air Forces required for co-operation with the Army.   The Air Forces to be maintained by the Air Ministry to fulfil their       responsibilities in Iraq and Palestine.       *   45. It is not possible at the present time to make a recommendation as to the  ultimate standard to  be  aimed at for any of the Servicesmentioned in paragraph 44.  As regards the Royal Air Force Unitsserving with the Navy, the ultimate strength in  war will be determined in the main by the number  of first line aeroplanes which can be carried by the Fleet, that is to say, by carriers, battleships and light cruisers.   46. As regards the Air  Forces  for co-operation with the  Army,the Secretary of State for Air has given an assurance to the Secretaryof State for War that any requirements will be fully satisfied, subjectto Treasury approval.  The actual figures  require  further detailed discussion between the Chiefs of the General Staffs.  This  consultationwas held up pending the decision on the relations of the Army and theAir Force.  The Committee recommend that these discussions  shouldbe pushed forward as rapidly as possible by the Chiefs of Staff underthe new procedure proposed in Part III.
   .47. Similarly, the ultimate establishment of the Air Forces abroadinvolves  many  uncertain factors,  such as the  future  of  Iraq and palestine, and the number of machines eventually to be provided for singapore.   48. The Committee are not concerned in the number of squadrons in India, which  are paid for by India and are a matter of negotiation between  the Government of  India, the India  Office  and the  AirMinistry.  The subject, however, has recently been fully explored bythe Committee on Indian Military Requirements.   49. In the above  circumstances, the Committee can only record their recommendation that there must be sufficient air strength for theNavy, the Army, the Overseas Garrisons  and Home Defence.  the squadrons and machines authorised  up to the 1st April, 1924, exclusive of Home Defence, are as follows :--United Kingdom                                  Machines.  (a) (i)  Fleet Air Arm. For embarkation in carriers         in all waters (13 flights)......    78      (ii) Naval Co-operation.

Army co-operation machines are not differentiated except inthe United Kingdom.                            AIRSHIPS.   50. A question which is closely related to the main inquiry is thatof airships,  which had been referred to  the Committee of ImperialDefence before  the  appointment of this Committee.  At the firstmeeting this question was remitted to an  Inter-Departmental Com-mittee composed of representatives of the  Admiralty, Air Ministry anaTreasury,  which was set up on the initiative of  the Air Ministry, andwas  asked to report. direct to  the  Committee  of Imperial Defence,
The policy of  the  Government on this question  was announced inParliament on the 26th July in the following terms :-       &quot; The question  of  the  development of airships has recently    been considered by the Committee of Imperial  Defence and the    Imperial  Shipping  Committee.  The  Committee  of  Imperial    Defence attaches considerable strategic value to airships, whilst    the Imperial Shipping  Committee considers that  it is by means of    an airship service that the carriage  of mails can most  cheaply    be expedited to the Par Bast and Australia.       &quot; The Government have, therefore,  decided to resume the    development of airships, and to proceed, if possible, by means of    a commercial service rather than by State operation.       &quot;. Proposals have been  placed before them by the hon.  and    gallant Member for TJxbridge (Lieutenant-Commander Burney),    under whioh a  bi-weekly service of six large airships to India will    eventually be set up.   The  Government have accepted the scheme    in principle, subject to the details of the contract being satis-&apos;    factorily settled by the Treasury.  The House of Commons will    have an opportunity of considering the scheme  when the details    have been provisionally agreed.       &quot; The Dominions are being informed of this decision, and it is    hoped to discuss the question at  the  Imperial Conference with a    view to their co-operation in the scheme.       &quot; The administration of the scheme in so far  as it  is a matter    of commercial aviation will come under the Air Ministry.&quot;*.102      PART  VII.-SUMMARY  OP  CONCLUSIONS  AND                     RECOMMENDATIONS.    51. The conclusions and recommendations of this Report may beI summarised as follows :-I Co-operation anal Correlation of the Services (paragraph 19).     (a)  While the Committee do not  put  forward any suggestion to           change the existing  division of responsibility between the           three Services as described in paragraph  10, they recom-           mend  that the responsibilities  of  the Navy and the Air           Force in regard to the protection of communications in the           narrow seas should form the subject of further investiga-           tion.   The Committee further recommend that experiment           in respect of the problems of air attack and defence at sea           should be given due  weight in Admiralty and Air Ministry           programmes,  in  order to secure on the basis  of practical           experience the fullest measure  of unity  of  professional           opinion.Sn *    Iml)erial Economic Conference,  1923.

    (b) The principal need as regards co-operation and correlation is           closer co-ordination, which is  dealt with in Part III of this           Report.    (c) The principle that in all belligerent operations in which more           than one  Service  is concerned, one  of  the  three Services           should be  selected  as  a  &quot; predominant partner &quot;  to  co-           ordinate  the other  Services  should  be examined by  the           Committee of Chiefs of Staffs.    (d) While the menace of attack froih the air has greatly increased,        il  and necessitates a strong Home Defence Air Force, as pro-           posed in Part VI of this Report, the three Staffs are agreed           that in existing conditions the liability of the country to           sea-borne invasion has considerably diminished as compared           with pre-war standards.Co-ordination of the Services (paragraph 36).    (e) It is undesirable and impracticable to supersede the Ministerial           heads  of   the  three fighting Services  by  making them           subordinates of a Minister  of Defence ; the alternative plan           for  an amalgamation of the three Service Departments is           equally impracticable.    (/) On the other hand, the existing system of co-ordination by           the  Committee of Imperial  Defence is not sufficient to secure           full initiative and responsibility for  defence as  a  whole,           and requires to be defined  and strengthened.    (g) Under the existing system the Committee of Imperial Defence,           an advisory and consultative  body, inquires into and makes           recommendations in regard to the issues of defence policy           and organisation which are brought before it.  The power           of initiative  lies with the Government Departments and           with the Prime Minister.    (h) This system,  though invaluable up to a point, does not make           any  authority, except the Prime  Minister,  who  can only           devote a small part of his time and attention to defence           questions, directly responsible for  the initiation  of  a con-           sisterit line  of policy directing the common  action of  the           three or any two  of the three Services, taking account of           the  reactions of the three Services  upon one another.    (i) While, therefore, the existing system of departmental initiative           will  continue, the responsibility  for the wider  initiative           referred to above  in paragraph (h) will also  rest with  the           Chairman of the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence acting           under the general direction of the Committee of Imperial           Defence and with the assistance of the three Chiefs of Staff.    (j) In accordance with the terms of the Treasury Minute of  the           4th May,  1904,  constituting  the  Committee of Imperial           Defence in  its present form,  the Committee of Imperial           Defence will continue to consist of the  Prime Minister, ai           President, with such other members  as, having  regard to           the nature of the subject to the  discussed,  he  may from           time, to time summon  to  assist him.   In pursuance of!
      decision by the Prime Minister, the Committee places on      record that the following should be members :         The Chairman (Deputy to the Prime Minister).        The Secretary of State for &quot;War,        The Secretary of State for Air.        The Pirst Lord of the Admiralty.        The Chancellor of  the  Exchequer,  or  the financial          Secretary.        The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.        The Secretary of State for the Colonies.  .        The Secretary of State for India.        The Chiefs of Staff of the three &quot;Fighting Services.        The Permanent Secretary to the Treasury as head of the          Civil Service.         In addition to these, other British or Dominion Ministers      of the Crown and other officials, or persons having special      qualifications,  will be summoned  as  members  by  the      President according to the nature  of the business.(k) The functions of the Chairman of the Committee of  Imperial      Defence will be      (i) To preside over the Committee of  Imperial Defence in          the absence of the Prime  Minister.     (ii) To report to the Prime Minister (when he himself has not          presided) and to the Cabinet the recommendations of          the Committee of Imperial Defence.    (iii) In  matters  of detail,  to interpret  the decisions  of the          Prime Minister  and  the Cabinet  thereupon to  the          Departments concerned..    (iv) Assisted by  the three Chiefs of Staff, as laid  down in           paragraph (i) above, to keep the defence situation as           a whole constantly under review so as to ensure that           defence preparations  and plans  and the expenditure           thereupon are co-ordinated and framed to meet policy,           that full information as to the changing naval, military           and  air  situation may  always  be  available &quot;to  the           Committee of Imperial Defence  and that resolutions           as to the requisite action thereupon may be submitted           for its consideration. (I) In addition to the functions of the Chiefs of Staff as advisers       on questions of sea, land or air policy respectively, to their       own  Board or Council, each  of the three  Chiefs of  Staff       will  have an  individual and collective  responsibility for       advising  on defence  policy  as  a whole,  the three  con-       stituting, as it were, a Super-Chief of a  &quot;War Staff in Corn-       mission.   In  carrying out this  function they will  meet       together  for the discussion of questions  which affect their       joint responsibilities. (w) Questions  relating to  co-ordination of  expenditure may be       entertained by the  Committee of Imperial Defence when193

The Committee (subject to           any directions by the Cabinet) will consider such questions           in the light of the general defence policy of the Government,           and of the strategical plans drawn up to give effect to that           policy in time of war.     (n) The Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence will           continue to  act as liaison officers between the Chairman of           the Committee and  the Service Departments.  The staff of           the Committee will  be strengthened by the addition of an           Assistant Secretary  to be nominated by the Prime Minister           on the  recommendation of the Secretary  of State for Air,           whose status will be identical with that of the three existing           Assistant Secretaries nominated by the Prime Minister on           the recommendation of the Secretary of State for War, the           Secretary of State  for India and the First Lord  of the           Admiralty.

The Air Forces required for co-operation  with the Army.        The Air &quot;Forces maintained by the Royal Air Force to fulfil            their  responsibilities in Iraq and Palestine.   The  figures,  excluding those for the Home Defence Air Force, sofar as they  can at present be arrived at, are given in paragraph 49.

THE Main Committee observe that the Special Sub-Committee are not altogether satisfied with the term &quot; Seconded &quot; which they have usedin describing the status of Naval officers serving in the Fleet Air Arm.It is clear that the actual  position of a Naval officer seconded, to theAir Service afloat differs from a seconded officer as hitherto understood.For example,  he continues to be under the ultimate tactical and.disciplinary orders at sea  of an  officer of the Service to  which hepermanently belongs, whilst he is serving under  the immediate com-mand  of an officer of the&apos; Service to which he is temporarily attached.Moreover, the work he is  called  on  to do in his temporary Servicedirectly relates to the needs of his parent Service, and he carries  it out under the eyes  of a commanding officer&quot;  of  his parent  Service,  TheMain  Committee  therefore  consider the term &quot; Seconded &quot; not alto-gether appropriate.

With  regard to uniform, the officers  and men generally of the fleet air Arm  will wear a distinguishing badge on their uniform.

SUB-COMMITTEE  ON RELATIONS  BETWEEN       THE  NAVY  AND THE  AIR  FORCE.REPORT.                           CONTENTS.                                                           page part   I.

Recommendations  .....................    33           PART I.-THE GENERAL PROBLEM.   1.  YOUR Sub-Committee were instructed to inquire into the rela-tions of the Navy and the Air Force as regards the control of Fleet air work, and on this point they have taken a great deal of evidence fromwitnesses representing both Departments.   In addition  to this,  two of our  members, Lord  Peel and  LordWeir, accompanied by Sir Maurice Hankey (Secretary), paid a visit tothe aerodromes  in the neighbourhood  of Portsmouth and the aircraft carriers &quot; Argus &quot; and &quot; Eagle.&quot;   2.  In  the course of  the somewhat acute controversy between thetwo Departments, a very large number of points have been raised whoseimportance is subsidiary and illustrative.  This was  inevitable, andprobably desirable ; but the broad principles lying at  the root of the policies respectively advocated by the contending parties are perfectlyintelligible, quite  apart  from the detailed  arguments, and counter-arguments by which they are supported.   3.  To the Air Ministry was given in 1917 control over the air forcesof the country.    The Department was at one stroke placed on a parwith the  Admiralty and the War Office, for, though aerial warfare is a growth of yesterday, it was felt that its rapidly increasing importancerequired an organisation which would ensure its development under themost favourable conditions.  In these circumstances it was only natural that the  Air Ministry should strongly object to being partially dis-membered so soon after it  had been brought into existence, the more so as in the early days of this dispute the severance of the Fleet Air Armfrom the  rest of  the Air Force meant an immensely larger proportionateloss than it would mean  at the present  moment.  But though the injury involved  in the complete removal from their jurisdiction of theFleet  Air Arm  is  relatively diminished, it  remains in  principle thesame, and if carried out to its logical conclusions would, in the opinion
of the Department, lead to many administrative difficulties and muchoverlapping, while in the region of supply and research it would hamperprogress and increase expense.   4.  The Admiralty case is  not less  worthy  of most serious con-sideration.  In their  view a Meet Air Arm is now as necessary to afleet as cruisers, destroyers or submarines.  Aerial reconnaissance andaerial  &quot;spotting&quot; are as strictly naval operations as gunnery, torpedowork  and wireless telegraphy.  It seems  to  them intolerable  that,while  they are responsible for the safety and success of our BattleFleets, the air work on which that  safety and  that success in large measure depend should be performed by persons belonging to anotherService,  imbued by different traditions,  and looking for  support andpromotion.to  a different Department.   5.  Your Sub-Committee have  the greatest sympathy with  both these points of view, and they have given much anxious thought to thequestion of how they can best  be dealt with.  They do not think thatthe present system can remain  altogether unchanged ;  neither do theythink  it possible to sever completely the Air organisation which doeswork for the Fleet from the Air organisation which is responsible for home Defence against ah attack and for co-operating with the Armyin other theatres  of  operation.  A course  somewhere between thesetwo extremes  is  the one  we recommend, but before describing oursuggestions in detail  it seems  desirable to give a brief sketch of thesystem now in course of development along the line where the two services come into contact.              PART  II.-THE PRESENT SYSTEM.                     THE GENERAL SYSTEM.  -   6.  The general system is that the Air Ministry  raises, trains andmaintains the Fleet Air Arm.  At sea the- Fleet Air Arm  comes underthe  operational and  disciplinary  control of  the  Admiralty, whichdesigns, builds and maintains the carriers.   The functions of the Fleet Air Arm comprise aerial reconnaissance,naval gunnery, spotting, bombing and fighting.        -*   The Fleet Air Arm operates  at sea from a carrier, which is a floatingaerodrome.  In addition, in time of war,  capital ships and cruisers willembark aeroplanes, but at  present the risk to  personnel  and materielis too  great to justify this in time of peace.   Air Force squadrons also operate over sea from shore bases in co-operation with theNavy, but these are not at present in question.   The numbers of the Royal Air Force personnel at present employedwith the Fleet Ah Arm are 115 officers and 681 other ranks.                             POLICY.   7. Naval Air policy is  concerted by the Air Staff  and admiralty war Staff.  Initiative may come from either side,  but naval officersof high rank do not, under the present system, have many opportunities of obtaining experience or training in Air matters to fit them for this work.
                        THE  COASTAL AREA.   8. Apart  from matters of  policy,  liaison is  secured  between theNavy and the Air Force by a  special machinery termed the &quot; CoastalArea &quot;  Organisation.  This is provided by the  Air Ministry for thepurpose of administering the Fleet Air  Arm on land, subject to thegeneral control of the Air Ministry,  The Coastal Area is commandedby  a senior  Air  Force Officer (the present occupant is an ex-naval officer) who is responsible for the maintenance at full strength of the personnel and materiel of the Fleet Air Arm, and for its special training for naval purposes.  He is the adviser to the Admiralty on Air mattersother than policy, and communicates directly with the  Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet,  on all  matters connected  with the Fleefsrequirements.   9. Under the Air Officer Commanding  the Coastal Area are  twoGroup Captains, with headquarters at Leuchars  (the Forth) and Lee-on-Solent, respectively.  In  the  case of larger  operations  involving the embarkation of aircraft or the carrying out of operations  fromshore bases,  the Naval Commander-in-Chief notifies his requirementsdirect  to  the  Air  Officer  Commanding  Coastal  Area.  For minoroperations he deals directly with one or other of the Group Captains.   10. Corresponding arrangements are made at Malta for the Mediter-ranean Fleet:                  POSITION ON  BOARD  CARRIERS.   11. As soon as the Air Units are on board the carriers  they come under the orders of the Naval Commandei-in-Chief, and are altogetheroutside the  control  of the Coastal Area Organisation, which is then,as we  have  already noted, only responsible for keeping units up to strength in air personnel and materiel.   The orders  for flying are givenby the Naval Commander-in-Chief (who has an  Air Force Officer onhis  Staff) to the  captain of the Aircraft Carrier, who is, of course, a naval officer, and he gives his orders to tho  senior Air Force Officer onboard.  The Royal Air Force personnel are responsible for the cleanli-ness and maintenance of their own quarters and some other parts of theship, such as the  aeroplane  deck.  They  can be employed on thegeneral duties of the ship.   Difficulties have, however, been, madein regard to  the performance  of particular duties such as the training and  use of Air Force personnel for passing ammunition to the guns,   12. A  certain  amount of  co-operation is practised  between the skilled mechanics of both Services.  The Royal Air Force may, forexample, utilise the services of the ship&apos;s blacksmith for certain repairs to aeroplane engines, and the Royal Air Force may undertake repairs to motor-boat engines.   Such co-operation is naturally limited by theliighly-specialised training which is inevitable in each Service.                       SUPPLY OP PERSONNEL.   13. The  Air Ministry are responsible for the supply of officers amiother ranks  for  duty with the Fleet Air Arm, with the  exception ofcertain naval officers, who, alter  training in Air Force establishments,
are employed as observers in &quot; spotting &quot; maoliines and some naval ratings employed as wireless telegraph operators.   14. It is of importance to note that the Eoyal Air Force possessesa number of officers who were formerly in the Royal Naval Ah Service,many of whom were trained as naval officers.  The senior positions inthe Meet Ah Arm are at present largely filled by these officers..  Theoriginal intention of the Ah Ministry was that, in order to replace these,some 30 per cent, of the  officers of the Fleet Air Arm should consistof naval officers seconded for a term of years.  Unfortunately, how-ever, only  a very few naval  officers responded to  the invitation to volunteer for this service.   15. It may be worth noting that the general system for the supplyof Air Force  officers  to  meet  future demands is  divided  into  two classes:         (a) Officers holding permanent Commissions ; and        (b)  Officers holding short-service Commissions.   16. Officers holding permanent Commissions, on  leaving  Cranwell,are given the choice of the particular branch in which they wish tospecialise.  Those selecting the  naval side will, in the first instance,do four years with the Fleet Air Arm.   They may then serve withother branches, including  courses of instruction, for a term of years inorder to gain wider experience, but will ultimately return to  the navalside  again.  This practice will ensure that  there will always be  a proportion  of senior  officers in the Royal Air Force with naval experi-once obtained in the  Fleet Ah Arm.   17. A proportion of the officers  holding short-service Commissionsfor five years, after receiving their initial training of one  year, areposted for  duty with  the Fleet Air Arm,  and do the  whole of their service with that branch.  On completion of their five years&apos; servicethey are posted to the  Reserve for five years,  when they are earmarkedas reserves  for the Fleet Air Arm in case of emergency.   18. The  Air Ministry endeavour to retain the personnel with theFleet Air units for the normal term of service      four years),  butexceptional cases arise when it is impossible  to allow them to  remain for the whole of that period.                            TRAINING.   19. The whole of the primary training of  flying personnel, whether their future work is to be on sea or on land,  is carried out by the AirMinistry.  No criticisms of it have been brought to our notice,  andwe do not propose to refer to it again.  The later and more specialisedtraining of the Fleet Ah Arm is partly conducted in the carriers  andpartly on land at technical schools maintained by the Air Ministry at certain naval ports.  Apart from their initial training, before they areembarked, the Air Detachments of carriers use these establishments fortraining, when not  required by the Naval  Commander-in-Chief forexercises.   It  will be  seen,  therefore, that as things are at presentthese establishments are used entirely for the  purposes of the Fleet air arm or  for shore-based aircraft co-operating with the Navy.  The AhForce training schools in tho Portsmouth area work in close touch
with the naval  gunnery and  torpedo schools.  Behind the establish-ments devoted exclusively to training for the Meet Air Arm are a seriesof technical  centres maintained for the Air Force  as  a whole, theresources of which are  available for the Fleet Air Arm.                   DESIGN  AND RESEARCH WORK.   20. New  design, experimental and research work to meet  navalrequirements  are carried out  by the  Air Ministry after consultationwith the Admiralty.   The Admiralty, after consultation between thetwo  Departments,  put forward their suggestions as to the types of machines  which they require, and  the  Air Ministry  design  suchmachines, as far as is practicable  from the point of view  of  aero-dynamics and similar technical consideration.  The Air Ministry draw up the specification of  the type required, and  call for designs from thetrade, and the Admiralty are kept fully informed of the progress made during the whole process and after the trials have  been carried out.   21. The  Navy are  not directly represented on the design, experi-mental or research branches at the Ait Ministry, but the Air Ministryutilise the services of a certain number of ex-naval officers, who havenow transferred to . the Air  Force, in these departments,  and also receive reports as to defects  in design and performance of machinesfrom  Air Force  officers serving with Fleet Air units, thus ensuring that due weight is attached  to the user&apos;s point of view in the modifica-tion and improvement  of design.   22. There is also in existence an Inter-Departmental Committeecalled  &quot; The  Joint Technical Committee on Aviation Arrangements inHis  Majesty&apos;s  Ships,&quot; which  consists  of  representatives of theAdmiralty  and  the  Air Ministry.   Its functions are to  examine thetechnical problems  which may arise with regard to the suitability ofthe types of aircraft intended for&apos;  embarkation on board carriers, andthe modifications and  improvements which can be effected on  board the carriers themselves.- It is clear from the evidence that new usesof aircraft involving possibly new types can be proposed either by thoAdmiralty or the Air Ministry, and that the latter give full considerationto all suggestions which may be put forward by the Navy.                    THE SUPPLY OP  MATERIEL.   23. At present the Air Ministry are solely responsible for the supplyof all materiel  connected  with aircraft.   An  establishment of the machines required for the Fleet Air Arm has been agreed upon betweenthe Admiralty and the Air  Ministry, and the latter is responsible for maintaining that establishment at full strength with its correct pro-portion of machines in reserve, the necessary spare parts and the variousshore organisations required for its maintenance.  This establishmentis at present limited by the  number of Aircraft Carriers in commissionin the Navy, but the  Air Ministry have made the necessary  arrangc-ments in their programme  of  construction to increase the number of machines up to  the number which.will be required when  the two new aircraft Carriers are completed in 1923-24.
               PART III.-RECOMMENDATIONS.   24.  We have endeavoured to explain, in the first place, the generalnature  of the objection felt by the  Ah Department to any importantchange in the existing system, and by the Admiralty to its maintenance.We have also given a full account of the system as it has been developedup to the present moment.  We now propose to turn to the future and make certain suggestions which, as we hope, may go far  to reconcile the contending parties and to  make  material improvements in theexisting system.   25.  Our task is materially lightened by the fact that, in the courseof discussions before your Sub-Committee, a larger measure of agree-ment was  found possible on certain aspects of the problem than had at one time seemed likely.   26.  In  the first place, it appeared  that on some  important pointsthe practice, though.not  the written law, of the Ah Department wasaheady in conformity with the wishes of the Admiralty.  Eor example,the Admiralty are very desirous that  the Group Captains in  contact with the Navy should be  officers with experience of the Fleet Ah  Arm.   First Recommendation. Broadly speaking,  the Air Ministry takethe same view, and we recommend  that it be made part of the settledpractice of the Ah Ministry to consult  with the Admhalty before such appointments  are made.  We  think  the  same principle should beextended to the Air Officer Commanding the Coast Defence Area andthe Senior Air Officer on board a carrier.   27.  The Admhalty desire that the Air Ministry shall provide all themateriel which they demand.  This, we believe, has always been theintention of the Ah Ministry.   Second Recommendation. We  think it  should be  formally  laiddown,  and that,  in the  event of the  Air Ministry for  one reason or another not carrying into  effect the wishes of the Admhalty, there shallbe an appeal by either party to the Committee of Imperial Defence.   28.  We have  no reason to believe  that  there is  any fundamental difference of opinion between the two  Services with  regard to certain questions of discipline, such, for example, as those which  might arise when a member of the Ah Force leaves the ship, where he is under the command, for every purpose, of the Captain, and goes for training tothe aerodrome, which is under the control of an officer of the AirForce.   Third Recommendation. But though there are no differences ofprinciple, there are .certain obscurities which  it would be desirableto clear up, and we therefore recommend that the two departments should,  in collaboration,  draw up a code of regulations which wouldmake clear the relations between them  at all points where they come in contact.   29.  In  all the cases that we have so far enumerated there may havebeen misunderstanding, but there has  not been at any time, so far asWe are  aware, any difference of principle.
   30. We now turn to a class of cases where, as a result of discussionbefore your Sub-Committee,  the Air  Department, have shown a dis-position to meet  Admiralty views.  The  first of these relates to theframing of the Naval Estimates.  The Admiralty desire that in these estimates should be included the cost of the Eleet Air Arm.   Fourth Recommendation. The Air  Department  are of opinion thattechnically this course would be inconvenient, but have no objectionto it in principle.   Your Sub-Committee are of opinion that this ques-tion should be settled by the Treasury in consultation with the twoEighting Services.   31. The Admiralty require that the Air Force on board ship shouldbe completely under the orders of its  Captain.   Your Sub-Committeeare of opinion that, inasmuch as all the airmen on board ship are underthe.Naval Discipline Act,  this, in theory,  is already provided for, butundoubtedly in the minds of those chiefly concerned some obscurityhangs over the subject.  This, we think,  should be explicitly cleared up.   Fifth Recommendation. The  position of a member of the Air Forcewhen on board ship does not differ in law,, and should not differ inpractice, from the position of, say, a Marine.   32. Sixth Recommendation. In order fully to carry out the policy laid down in the preceding paragraph,  we recommend, and have reasonto believe  that the  Air  Ministry will accept the principle, that allreports on officers of the Fleet Air Arm, whether confidential or pther-wise, should be signed by  the Captain of the ship and  passed throughthe Naval Commander-in-Chief  to the Air Officer Commanding the coastal Area.   .33..Seventh  Recommendation-A.  further point which  should bedealt with under this heading is one on  which the  Admiralty haveexpressed considerable anxiety and on which we have reason to believethat the Air Force are prepared  to meet their wishes.   The Admiraltyare apprehensive lest, in time  of war or other emergency,  the AirMinistry might1 \vithdraw  from the Navy units  of the Fleet Ah Armand use them for other purposes.  In respect of this  we recommendthat it should be definitely laid  down that the personnel, materiel and reserves of the Fleet Air Arm  should not  be withdrawn by the AirMinistry without either the consent of the Admiralty or a decision ofthe Cabinet.    34. Before concluding this class of questions,  we must  take note of a complaint made by the Admiralty that on board the carrier thereis a good deal of duplication of effort between the.purely Naval Serviceand the Air Force.    Eighth Recommendation. We think this subject should  be looked into by the  two Departments concerned and we do  not doubt thatarrangements can be made by which all overlapping can be  effectivelyavoided.    35. We now come to the last class of questions  with which we haveto deal,  which are at once the most difficult and the most important
We are strongly of opinion, and we have every hope that the two services share our view, that, since in war the Services may have toco-operate, it is vital that in time of peace they should form an accurate estimate of each other&apos;s needs and capacities.   Ninth Recommendation. We therefore recommend      (i) That Naval officers should be appointed to the Air Staff.     (ii) That Air Force officers should be appointed to the Naval War          Staff.    (ii) That some means should be devised by which the wealth of          technical knowledge at the disposal of the Admiralty should          be utilised in the technical departments of the Air Ministry,          preferably  by reinforcement of the staff of these  depart-          ments by naval  technicians.   36.  These recommendations refer exclusively to the headquarterso  the two Services ; but it is perhaps even more important that theji lior ranks of the two  Services, who will in time occupy responsiblep. sitions,  should  have a considerable sprinkling of persons familiarw,un the needs and capacities  of the other Service.   37.  The Air Force look to a system of naval seconding for carryingout half this policy, and we cannot believe that the Admiralty wouldbe averse  to having members  of the Air Force on board the carriers.Unfortunately, seconding from the Navy to the Air Force, as at presentunderstood, must be deerned to  have been hitherto a failure,  and we find it difficult to believe that, if the present system remains unchangedand unexplained, any great improvement is likely to occur.   We cannotbe surprised that a young  officer  who  has  just joined the Navy  isreluctant to  abandon,  even temporarily, the department under which he expected  to serve and to exchange it for  one which is  essentiallydifferent.  The feeling is natural and cannot be ignored.   It must, however, be pointed out that if the word &quot; seconding &quot;is thus used this is not what any naval officer under the present scheme isexpected to do.  In ordinary practice, when  we say that an officer  is&quot; seconded &quot; to another Service we  no doubt  intend  to express theidea that for the duties which he had to perform and for the authoritieshe had to obey in the Service which he has  temporarily left, will besubstituted new duties and new authorities.   But this  does not reallyrepresent  the  facts in the  case of so-called &quot; seconding &quot; from theNavy into the Air Force.  The duties of the seconded officer, thoughcarried out in the air, remain,  nevertheless, naval  duties, and the captain whom he has to obey continues to be a Naval Captain.   Tenth Recommendation. In order to  make this situation perfectly clear, we recommend that no seconded naval officer shall be asked to perform non-naval air duties, except with the consent of the Admhalty.We believe the Air Force are prepared to accept this principle.   38.  If this recommendation be carried into effect, the most importantchange involved in the operation of  what is  (somewhat inaccurately)called &quot; seconding &quot; is. the change from the naval to a flying uniform-a change  which can hardly be said  to touch the  essence of thesituation,
   Eleventh Recommendation. We suggest, however, in order to meetthe sentimental, though not on that account unimportant objection,that the uniform of a naval flying  man who, except for his period oftraining, is to all intents and purposes still under the Admiralty, shouldbe distinguished from the flying men  under the Air  Force by somedifferentiating badge or mark.  This would be the outward and visiblesign that he still remains a member of  the Service which he originallyjoined.,j  It would  be a clear indication  that what he proposes to do isto add accomplishments in naval flying to the  other accomplishmentswhich his brother officers are cultivating.  If such a plan were foundpracticable, the objection felt by the Admiralty to the introduction ofwhat they deem an alien element into the  domestic  life of the shipshould be largely mitigated.   39. It might well be that, if this scheme  succeeded, the number ofofficers seconded from the  Navy to  the Air Force would exceed the30 per cent,  of the total contemplated by the Air Service.   Twelfth  Recommendation. We  see  no reason  why 30  per cent.should be regarded as the maximum, and we should propose to leave it to the Admiralty to determine what the proportion should be, subjectto the proviso that not less than  30 per cent, of Air Force Officers,whether regular or short service, should serve on board the carriers.   40. There is another point of great practical importance on whichsomething must be said.  It is agreed that the work of spotting for&apos; naval gunnery is one which should be undertaken in all cases by naval officers, but such investigations as we have been able to make convinceus  that naval spotting and fleet reconnaissance cannot  be  sharplydivided, and that  the officer entrusted with the one- may inevitably findhimself called upon to perform the other also.  Wo have been unableto discover any objection to this change, which, on the face of it, seemsobviously reasonable.    Thirteenth Recommendation. We therefore  recommend that  fleetreconnaissance, as well as naval spotting, should be entrusted to naval officers,  seconded  or otherwise.    41.  If  anybody will take the trouble to read the evidence given before us they will, we believe, be impressed by the number of problems for which a solution has been found by the two Departments or suggestedin this Eeport.  We earnestly trust that no merely technical difficulties will be allowed to stand in the way of a settlement, which in the public interest is most urgently required.
