[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1924.1SECRET.ffffp                                            IllStlCP. 24  (24).           CABINET.  SPECIAL   REPORT   ON    UNEMPLOYMENT.       No.   100.   Period ended December 31, 1923.    THE figures in Part I (A) of the report indicating the total number of work-people unemployed on the 31st December show an increase of 113,129 as comparedwith the previous fortnight.    An eA&apos;en sharper rise of 127,819 was announced early in January of last year.    This sudden jump upwards in the unemployment figure is due to holidays, andseasonal causes connected with Christmas and the end of the year.    Last year, by the beginning of February, the total had fallen again by almost thesame amount as the big rise announced at the beginning  of January, and the downward curve in the unemployment chart then continued fairly steadily.  Thereare already  indications that a fall is not improbable  during  the present monthanalogous to that which took place throughout January 1923.    As, however, in  view of our  experience of last year, it will probably not bepossible for some weeks to ascertain how far this big dislocation is, as last year,temporary in character,  the analysis of the industrial position by localities and industries set out in Part I  (B) and Part II of the report is confined to the period ended at Christmas prior to the big increase of  113,129 mentioned1 above.

Coal Mines. Employment continued good generally and was slightly better than during November.  The number of wage-earners on the colliery books on the 22ndDecember (1,185,000) showed an increase of 5 per cent, as compared with the previousDecember.  The average weekly number of days worked by the miners during the fort-night ended the 22nd December was 5-68 compared with 5-54 in the previous month. In.the Yorkshire and Durham fields employment remained good.  The  amount of coal and coke shipments from the Tyne during October was reported to be unprecedentedin the history of the coal export trade of the district.  Continental  demand is con-tinuing good and shipments to Germany are especially heavy.  Prospects are brighteras a result of the  improved position  in the shipyards.   A steady and substantial increase in  the home demand for  all kinds  of manufacturing fuel is  confidently-anticipated.   On the Lancashire  coal-fields most collieries are working five days a week and the position is likely to remain satisfactory.  In the Midlands, employ-ment continues good with a tendency to improve.  Full-time working continues in.North Staffordshire.  At Coalville and Leicester stocks are being reduced and output is absorbed day by day.  At Chesterfield there has been an increased  demand duringthe period.  Cobbles and nuts for steel smelting are moving in large  quantities, andthere is a heavier  demand for slack for boiler and electrical work.  The continuedshortage of. railway wagons in nearly all Midland districts is giving  rise to  muchanxiety amongst colliery owners. In the Forest of Dean steady work continues andthe Bristol and Somerset coal-fields  show slight improvement.  In Wales there was ageneral improvement during  the month.  Orders  have exceeded output, tonnage  is-again  plentiful and collieries work fairly  regularly.  The position  continues  to be-steady in Scotland.  At the  sea ports of  the Firth, and Forth, exports from theFife and Lothian coal-fields continue to show an increase compared with last year.    Stone  Quarries. The Portland Stone  Quarries are still very busy, and  there-is much employment available, especially for skilled men.    China Clay. Employment continued good on the whole.    Iron and Shale Mines. Generally there has been a slight improvement duringthe month and there is every prospect of increased activity in  the  near  future..Employment in shale mines continued  fair.                     &apos;&apos;    Tin Mines. No change has occurred in the position in the Cornish tin-mines, andemployment there is still very bad.IRON  AND  STEEL  PRODUCTION.    Employment in the pig-iron industry showed a further improvement during themonth.  There is  a  steadily  expanding demand  for pig-iron, which  has alreadyincreased production.  Orders are  coming  forward,and prospects are  regarded asencouraging.  Eleven additional blast-furnaces are reported to have been put intowast m the North-East Coast area.  Imports of iron-ore  continue to be on a large      [HI 1^]                                                      B 2
  scale as compared with previous months in South Wales.  The output is increasing  and keeps pace with the continued activity in the tinplate and sheet trade.  .,.  .The position in the iron and steel trade  is still slack, hut these industries are  reviving and, with the increased demand, prices have risen  and scrap metals have  il3fV!10ved upwards.. The two main causes of increased activity have been the revival  of shipbuilding and repairing and the winter programmes on railway reconstruction  and -development.  Stockton has felt the effect, of orders for shipbuilding material  and employment  there, has  increased.-., Middlesbrough. has secured an  order for  8,000 tons of rails for:a railway company;  Rotherham and Sheffield-have  also a  share in the benefit of the railway programme.  . .  . , In the  Midlands employment in these industries is still  bad, but it is reported  that many,  contracts for the New  Year are in  progress of  negotiation. - Trade is  fairly good  at Stourbridge and Tipton.   There has been a distinct improvement &quot;during, the  month at Walsall.   The position at Brierley Hill is still  very bad,  Approximately 1,000 iron and steel workers being unemployed in the district.  In  North Staffordshire-trade is steady.  Large railway orders for steel rails and girders  have been secured at Hanley  . Unemployment has increased at Burslem.  Practically  all South Wales  steel-works are busy.  The exceptions  are Risca and  Dowlais  (Merthyr),,where intermittent working is still prevalent.   Improvement is shown at  Cardiff. &apos; In Scotland the outlook appears  to be still more encouraging, especially  on the Clyde, where the revival of shipbuilding and repairing has a &quot;direct influence  on the industry.   At Airdrie one firm has restarted 350  workers, who have been .idle for over twelve months. - For the first time for two years the number of  shifts  has been increased at an important factoryfor rivets, bolts and mits at Coatbridge.  TIN-PLATE AND STEEL SHEET. - -   Employment  continued  good.  Practically&apos; all tinplate works  are engaged at  high pressure.  The demand for tinplate  remains good, and  the market has a firm tone;. The works have good orders booked and have little  time to spare before tho end of&apos;March.&apos;             .    - SHIPBUILDING  AND  SHIP-REPAIRING.     Employment, though still very depressed, showed ,an improvement during the month.  The settlement of  the  Boilermakers&apos; dispute occurred late  in  November and  its effects have  become  very: evident during December,  as  more men are being gradually re-engaged.  New orders are  coming to hand, and it is expected that  improvement will continue.  So far as. the North-Eastern area is  concerned registrations of unemployed workpeople in these industries  have been reduced by 5,357;  in  the Tyne  area,  3,290  in  the  Wear  area  and  2,625   in  the Tees &apos; area.    The extent  of   the   recent  depression  in  this   industry  on the North-East  Coast  is  reflected  in  the  fact  that  the  tonnage  of  ships produced during  1923 is  lower than in any year since 1887.  On the Mersey-side there has been a decided improvement; large numbers of skilled workmen have been absorbed by the shipbuilding firms and it is expected that the  situation will steadily improve.  Increased  activity  is also  apparent at  Barrow-in-Furness, where Messrs. Vickers (Limited), have secured contracts, which enabled the firm to employ approximately 1,500 additional men during the month.    - Employment  in the London ship-repairing yards is poor,  with the exception of some continued activity at Bermondsey.  In the South-West there has been marked improvement, and large numbers of orders are now  being given.  At Ayonmouth and Bristol  the docks-have been exceptionally busy,  and the ship-repairing yards have had a, share in the general activity.  At Cowes the position has improved owing-to  the receipt of  an order  for reconditioning Greek  destroyers.  Additional men have been engaged and prospects are brighter.  A new dock scheme is contemplated at  Southampton.  At Portsmouth and Devonport no notable change is  reported, but more entries-chiefly among  fitters-have been effected in the  dockyards.  At Poole some discharges have taken place  owing to the decline in ship breaking operations. At Falmouth improvement continues, 120 additional men having been placed in employ- ment during the mpnth and steady.work is anticipated during the next six months. There is still, however, a large surplus of shipyard workers to be  absorbed,  roi example, 1,000 men in this industry are unemployed at  Wooltson.  In  Wales tne employment, position remains bad.                                          . a  - ,   On the Clyde the reabsorption of workers in  this and allied trades is becoming more apparent&quot;, and there  is evidence to.show that the process  will be accelerated j the New Year.  At Dumbarton,  an 8,000-ton steamer and a number  of contract
188held up by the recent dispute are to be commenced after the New Year holidays.At  Govan the  shipbuilding yards have work on hand for the first time for  twelvemonths.  At Clydebank  a large contract  for the reconditioning  and converting tooil  of a  Cunard liner, and  a further contract for the  repair of  a  C.P.R. liner-will- provide  a substantial  amount  of work until  late  Spring.   In  Aberdeenfour firms have received  orders, which will keep them  busy for six months at least.The extent of the recent  depression in these industries on the Clyde is indicated bythe fact  that  the output  for  the district for 1923 was  172,275 tons,  the  lowesttonnage recorded since 1887 as in the case of the North:East Coast area.       :  ,ENGINEERING.    Employment remains bad on  the whole, but improvement is reported in various districts  and a more hopeful outlook has been created by recent placing of contracts in connection with the winter programme of the. railway companies. In the  North-Eastern area a further improvement was apparent and the conditions in the ironand steel trades seem better than they have been for many months past.  The position at Elswick, Horbury  (Wakefield), Leeds, Lincoln and  Rotherham  has  been relieved by  the placing of contracts. for  locomotives. and . railway rolling-stock.   It  is .niptexpected that these contracts will  lead to a very large reduction in the unemployment figures of the districts concerned, but they will necessarily increase to a very largeextent the employment for men engaged  on short  time.   At Sheffield the cruciblesteel departments. are quiet, but railway  demands will  undoubtedly cause moreactivity in this branch.   Wire trade reports  progress, but the  cutlery and platebranches are extremely quiet for this time of the year.   Constructional, engineering(bridge building) is active at Middlesbrough, and snows an.improvement at Stockton.    The position in many large Lancashire towns remains very depressed.  Blackburnand Bolton areas are very much affected by slackness in this industry., Some iniprove-ment is  apparent in Manchester, where working hours  have been, extended and additional men engaged,  but  there is still severe  unemployment; there.   Textileengineering firms at  Oldham, Accrington and  Bolton  continue to work short time.The locomotive, electrical and motor firms in the North-Western area are fairly wellemployed                                -                  /&apos;-&apos;&quot;  v  &apos;.     In the Midlands  depression continues bothln general engineering and the motorAND cycle trades, but there is a  tendency towards improvement in both branches.At Aston 1,500 motor workers were suspended for three weeks extending over the christmas holidays.  Short time  in the motor trade is being worked at Derby.. AtCoventry so far as motor engineering is concerned, improvement continues, and thereis every possibility of a good winters trade.  There is a remarkable dearth  of boysand youths from 14 to 20 years of age, and all available labour of  that  type has been cleared from surrounding towns.  Improvement has occurred at Nottingham; tradeis brisk  at Tipton where overtime  is being worked,  and there  has been a slightimprovement at Wolverhampton and Stafford.  With regard to general engineeringIN  the Midlands, several large firms are fully employed  at Beeston.   The  textileengineering at Nottingham has improved.   The &quot;London, Midland  and Scottish.Railway workshops at Derby  are engaged  at  full pressure.  At  Chesterfield mostfirms are working full  time.  The  position at Leicester and Loughborough  has improved, and at Newark trade&apos; is good,  particularly  with ball-bearing, pump  andengine makers.  At Kettering and Peterborough, there is still much unemployment.     In London and the South-Eastern Counties considerable improvement is reported m all districts where motor-engineering is carried  on, but general and heavy engineering remain slack.  Improvement is reported  at Dartford and Erith.  .In the South-Western Counties  there has been no appreciable change during the  month. At Basingstoke and Bath  firms are  still busy.   Employment  has  increased at -MVMDON. Motor-car and motor-cycle works, at Oxford and Kingswood are busy.  The Gloucester Aircraft  Company have  increased their staff, and the Super-Marine Engineering Company at  Woolston is still working at full pressure.  A high level of employment in railway-carriage  and  wagon works continues, and  tljere  is  a shortage of coach-body  builders and  finishers.   Gloucester Wagon  Works have obtained an order for 225  mineral wagons.  The position is bad generally in  Wales.  there has been a temporary  improvement at Cardiff and Port Talbot,  and a  falling oft at Newport and  Llanelly.  In the west of Scotland  the. ship  and locomotive uffl    0^ ^e tra(^e are comparatively busy, and prospects are brighter. At Dundee ah firms hitherto working short-time&apos;are now&apos;fully employed.  The North British Locomotive  Company- at Springburn have received an order for forty-six engines, including twenty of the 2,000&apos; h.p.&quot;&quot;Pacific&quot; type                  &apos;,&apos;*,__rf!$J,            -&apos;&apos;...-:&apos;.&apos;:&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;/-;Viv^-;:-:&apos;--::&apos;.,^&apos;-!-.:
  TEXTILES.      Cotton. There has been no important change in the general position during the  month. The Egyptian Spinning.Section of the trade continues to be fully employed,  and prospects are considered to be  good.   Since November  there has  been no  organised curtailment of production,  but  in the American Spinning Section it is  estimated that the equivalent of 70 per cent, of full time was worked  during the  month.  The  position in  this Section improved slightly up  to  Christmas, but the  market continues to be disturbed on account of the violent fluctuations in the price  of raw cotton, which have, in a marked degree, interfered with  an extension  of the  cotton industry at a time when a revival of trade seemed imminent. For  this  reason  it is impossible to state with any confidence what the present employment prospects  are. In the Weaving Section there has been no material alteration during the month.  The position is still bad, but further improvement is expected in the New Year.  The  situation in Blackburn improved during the period, and more machinery is running  than at any time during the year.  It is reported that there  are  16,000 looms idle  at present as  compared with 34,000 idle in May last.  At Burnley the  position is  not so good, and in spite of  a temporary improvement before Christmas, there are  still large  numbers of cotton operatives remaining on  the Employment Exchange  Live Register.  In Yorkshire  some  improvement  occurred during the  month, but  this was considered to be of a temporary nature, and the  outlook is regarded as  uncertain.      Hosiery. Unemployment is still serious, and  much short  time is  being worked.  The position, however, in the Midlands varies considerably in the different districts.      Woollen and Worsted. Some improvement took place in employment during  the month, but this was due largely to what is apparently an established  practice  on the part of Yorkshire employers to make a special effort to give full employment,  as far  as possible, for the period immediately preceding the Christmas holidays.  At  Batley7 orders  have been more numerous, and the signs are encouraging.   There is a  better  outlook in Bradford,  where there has been a decrease in  the Register for  textile workers.   The general opinion there  is that no  permanent recovery can be  made until the European rates of exchange  cease to operate so favourably to the  Continental competitors.   There  has been  increased  employment at   Brighouse,  Dewsbury,  Otley,  Shipley and  Wakefield, while  unemployment has increased at  Halifax and Sowerby Bridge.  The  position at Wakefield shows  that employment  is likely to remain  fairly good for at least a few months.  There has been general  improvement in  the heavy woollen trade rugs, blankets, &amp;c. at Dewsbury, due to  orders from Japan.  The rag trade is better than  it  has  been since  the slump  in 1921.      Lace. Employment continues bad, and there is no sign of general improvement.  Trade  in the Curtain and Plain Net Section is fair, but in spite of a slight improve-  ment the position in the Lever&apos;s Section is still very depressed.  At Tiverton full time  was worked for about a fortnight before  Christmas, but suspension  for extended  holidays was unavoidable.      Silk. Employment continued very slack in the Macclesfield, Leek and Congleton  district. At Derby trade in  artificial  silk  was brisk, and at  Coventry employment* improved.  The silk trade was good at Yarmouth.      Jute.-Employment in Dundee and Forfar continued fairly good, and there was  improvement during the month.  There is  a continuance of orders which will soon  result in the use of machinery which has, for some time, been idle.      Carpets. Employment is good  at Kidderminster, and  trade there  is very  flourishing.  BUILDING  AND  BRICK  AND  TILE  MANUFACTURE.      The building and  allied.trades  remained busy, subject  to  some irregularity  due to seasonal causes.  All districts report that apart from stoppages due to frosts  there  is no diminution of activity in the  building trade.   There  is  a  genera]  shortage of bricklayers, masons and plasterers, which in some districts  is preventing  expansion  in  the industry.  There are vacancies in national circulation for ijo  bricklayers, 200 masons   (excluding,  monumental masons),   and  125   plasterers.  Painters and unskilled labourers are suffering severely from unemployment mnemj  all districts, and the absorption of the unskilled labour is unlikely until the shortage
107in the skilled occupations has been supplied.  Unemployment among painters is, ofcourse, a seasonal feature of the trade, but some relief has been afforded in various districts by Local Authorities placing painting contracts  for schools and other public buildings-^notably London County Council Schools.    The brick and tile making trade  remains good on the whole, although varyingin different districts.  The trade was good*at Hereford, Coalville and Cannock..: Animprovement has occurred at Derby.   No change is  reported from Peterborough,where the position was  satisfactory last month.  Short-time working prevails atBrierley Hill, and considerable unemployment exists at Dudley.  The fire-brick branchat Sowerby Bridge is more active, owing presumably to  the improved conditions inthe iron and steel trade:  In the South-Western Counties employment is  still at ahigh level, but shows some signs of seasonal depression.CLOTHING.    Employment in  this industry is  bad and  further depression has taken place during the month.   The decline in the wholesale  tailoring trade has continued inLondon, and now both the West End and the  East End&quot; are  affected.  The dress-making and underclothing trades in London are very depressed.   Severe unemploy-ment exists among tailoresses throughout the South-Eastern Counties.  In the North-East Counties practically all districts report unemployment among dressmakers andmilliners.  There was increased unemployment in Manchester among women engagedin the wholesale clothing trades, but  at Crewe the wholesale trade and shirt  andunderclothing manufacture are still fair.  Unlike other districts most centres in theMidlands are fairly  busy in the wholesale and bespoke  tailoring trades.   Seasonalslackness is apparent in the  South-Western Counties.    The  straw  hat  season has commenced at Luton  and St.  Albans, resulting in increased employment for some hundreds of women.  The corset  trade is  still very bad, but there has been a slight change for the better both in the South-Western andMidland  Counties.   At Yeovil the glove trade is still bad but improving,  and most.factories  there are now engaged on four or five days per week.  Glove making atWorcester remains depressed.BOOT AND SHOE.                            \    In the main centres this industry is still very depressed.  At Northampton therewas a decided improvement just before Christmas,  but trade is still slack.   Improve-ment early in the New Year is confidently expected.  At Stafford  most factories are working  full time, but there is  still a surplus  of  both men and women operatives.At Wellingborough employment is steady and very little short  time is worked there. One or two factories are working overtime,&apos; but  there is little  demand for handsewnwork. The demand for young girls as learners at Wellingborough- exceeds the supply.The position at Leicester, Kettering and Wolverhamption shows a slight improve-ment during the month.  Trade was  fair at  Derby and Mansfield.  In the North-eastern Counties manufacturers have a fair amount  of work on hand, and exporttrade is reported to be better. In London and the South-Eastern Counties no general improvement can be reported.   At Bristol and Kingswood  trade was fair on thewhole. In Scotland  the December trade was generally fair, but at Arbroath it wasvery bad. POTTERY.     The  employment position remains bad, but there was some  improvement just before Christmas. The home demand  has slackened considerably, but there was still a fair amount  of export trade.  Most firms closed down for extended Christmas holidays.  The electrical porcelain brancn at  Hanley was very busy, and there was further improvement in the stone and brown-ware sections&apos;at Chesterfield.  The satisfactory  condition of the horticultural pottery trade at Basford is maintained. the porcelain factory at Derby is working full time, but at Worcester trade was only lair, and prospects  are not  encouraging.  The  employment position  at Bristol was tair and  at Barnstaple, Exeter and Poole was very good.                          * TRANSPORT.     From nearly all the main ports improvement was reported  in the employment position  at the  docks.  This was directly due  to special Christmas  trade and can K X 13(3 regarded as a temporary improvement.   Business was reported to be very  nsK at all the London docks with the exception of those in the East Ham area, and
the activity was chiefly  due to food and timber  imports.  At the North-eastern and North-Western  ports similar  temporary  activity  was manifest.   The LiveRegisters  for  dock workers decreased considerably at&quot; Avonmouth and Bristol, butat Southampton Docks there was  depression due to the mid-winter stoppage  of the trans-Atlantic passenger trade.  Gloucester and Sharpness Docks were slack duringthe month, but it is reported that a new line of steamers from Norway to Gloucesteris to be established at  an early  date with the object of distributing Norwegianproduce in the Midlands.    At  Cardiff and Barry work in the docks was fair, being1 mainly in connectionwith coal shipments.  There was a slight improvement during the period at Newportand Swansea.  At Holyhead the  increase in Irish traffic has given an  impetus to employment at the docks.                       III. OVERSEAS  SETTLEMENT.                                  (Colonial  Office.)     Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia,New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion authorities concerned.  In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land havebeen agreed  with the Governments  of New South  Wales,  Victoria and Western Australia.   A number  of organisations,&apos; having as  their  object the provision of facilities for&apos;the  settlement of  immigrants in certain  of the Dominions, have alsobeen assisted.   An extension  of this assistance to  other   organisations  is  underconsideration.

To  assist  in the  provision of  employment for  demobilised members  of HisMajesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed  into industry,  theGovernment  after the Armistice inaugurated a  special fund for  the purpose  ofmaking grants  on certain  conditions to  Highway Authorities for road work.   Thetotal of such grants has amounted  to  approximately  9,328,000  for Great  Britain,and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost  approximately  20,000,000.(ii.)

    An additional programme was authorised by the Government in  October last.This contemplates a Government contribution to a maximum of  8,050,000 towards atotal estimated expenditure of  11,750,000, excluding the possible construction.of anew road connecting Liverpool and Manchester,  the inclusion  of  which brings thetotal programme up to the figure of  14,000,000  announced by Ministers.(iii.) Port of London Dock Extension.    Early in 1923,  the  Prime Minister  was informed by the  Port of london authority that certain extensive.works could be put in hand at once for the relief of unemployment if the Government would assist with a loan on favourable terms.A loan of  4,500,000 at 3^ per cent, was promised by the Prime Minister.  It was arranged  that this loan should be advanced from  the Local Loans Fund, at the rateof interest applicable to such loans, the Exchequer undertaking  to pay the differencebetween the annual loan  charges  (on the annuity basis), and  the 3-J  per  cent, onoutstanding advances to be paid by the Port;  Advances were to  be repaid in fullby the Port at the end of thirty years from the date of advance.    Two Schemes have been under consideration.   The construction of a new deep-water  dock and  a new dry dock at Tilbury, and of a new deep-water  dock and animpounding station at the Surrey Commercial Docks.  Work on  the latter scheme has been commenced, but the Tilbury Scheme, which will require a public enquiry andan order by the Minister of Transport, has, owing to certain difficulties, not yet been settled.    It is now estimated that the cost of the Tilbury Scheme will be about  7,000,000,while the cost of the Surrey Commercial Dock Scheme will approximate to  585,000.The present value of the assistance promised by the Exchequer, on the basis of theloan of  4,500,000, is estimated at approximately  1,150,000.(D.)
