At the International Labour Conference of 1921 a Draft-Convention was adopted providing (a) that the use of whitelead should be prohibited for the internal painting of buildings (subject to certain exceptions) as from November,1927j  (b) that Regulations should be applied to externalpainting, and, during the interval before prohibition comes into force, to internal painting.   This Convention wasadopted as a compromise and agreed to by all parties.   Acopy of the Draft Convention is attached.      At the time when the conference was meeting, the question of the use of lead paints in this country was underfurther examination by a Departmental Committee, of whiohSir Henry Norman was Chairman.   This Committee reported inFebruary, 1923, that they could not support the recommenda-tion made by the earlier Home Office Committee of 1911 forthe entire prohibition of lead paint both for external andfor internal work, becauBO experience had shown that for external work there is at present no efficient substitute for lead paint, but that thOTr thought tho agreement reached at Geneva was a satisfactory method of dealing with thequestion.      Although at Geneva  the white lead manufacturers agreed,through their representatives, to tho Convention, they havesubsequently repudiated the agreement, mainly on the groundthat a new process of wet rubbing down has been invented whichHUMHILl
thoy contend practically eliminates the dangers from lead.dust.   They also maintain that when they agreed to theConvention at Geneva they had been misled as to the propor-tion of lead paint used in internal work .and that subsequentenquiries have convinced them that prohibition for internalwork would mean a much more serious loss to the manufacturing trade than they had anticipate do      I understand that the question of ratification wasdebated at some length by the Home Affairs Committee of thelaBt Cabinet, and when the matter came before the full &apos;Cabinet it was decided that, in view of the forthcomingdissolution of Parliament; the question should stand over until after the- election.      The view always taken by the Home Office has beenthat the Convention should be ratified.   The risk of lead poisoning incurred by house painters is serious andindisputable, and owing to the nature of the industry, this risk cannot be effectively met, as it is met in factoryprocesses, by exhaust fans and other safety regulations.The recent invention of waterproof sandpaper by means ofwhich the process of wet rubbing down can be substituted forthe process of dry rubbing down is a valuable invention whichmay have a great influence in diminishing the risk of lead poisoning;  but it will be difficult, and will probably bethe work of years, to induce workmen to abandon the practioeof dry rubbing down, which has been in use for generations,and to use the new process consistently.   Owing to thenature of the industry systematic enforcement by FactoryInspectors must always be very difficult,.   However largethe staff of Inspectors, they could not hope to  eep any effective supervision over painting work done inside and outside houses and buildings all over the country.   If theConvention Is ratified, we may fairly&apos; count upon the general support of the master painters and working painters to
  co-operate with  tho Department  in  securing full&quot; compliance  with its provisions, but  this co-operation could not be  expected if  the  compromise  of Geneva were rejected.        I accordingly recommend that the  Government  should  .  decide to ratify the Convention.    if this decision is taken,  it will be necessary at once to introduce a  Bill providing  (a)  that as  from November,  1927, tho use of  lead paint for  internal work  shall be prohibited,  subject to  the  exceptions  mentioned in the Convention, and  (b) providing for Regulations  for  the painting of buildings.   At present  there  is no power  under the Factory Act to  make such Regulations,.   A draft code  was,  however,  drawn up by tho Homo Offico after the Oonforenoo  of  1921 in collaboration  with the  Painters&apos;  and Decorators&apos;  Industrial Joint Council  and this  code  san be  brought into  effect as soon as the necessary Bill becomes law.        So far as  the Bill  is concerned with Regulations, no  opposition is  to be expected.   To tho  proposal for partial  prohibition  the  white lead  manufacturers will  no doubt do their  beBt to raise  opposition, but their case is  not strong,  especially as  the Master  Painters  are adhering to  the  Convention.        It is  very desirable  that a  decision  should  be taken as  soon as possible, as until  that is done the  vrtiolo  question  of  protective  measures for  workers in the painting industry  is  held up.        The steps  will be -     (l) an official announcement that tho Government propose to  ratify the Convention and to introduce  the necessary legisla-  tion to give effect to its  provisions:     (2) the passage through  Parliament of a Bill;     (3) as soon as the Bill  has  passed,  formal.ratification by  tho Government of the Convention&apos;.        If the Cabinet agroo  to those proposals,  I will at  onoe  circulate a  draft Bill for  Cabinet approval.                                         A.H.4/2/24.  ,,,                           *
