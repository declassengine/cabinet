The principal Contracting Departments have under-E13RAT10N$OVERMEN IfS.         taken to accelerate Government work during the present           winter to the following extent:-                     Admiralty ................    1,010,000                     War Office           .....      515,000                     Office of Works and Forestry                            Commicisicn,.........      200.000                     Post Office...............,   1,000.000                                                 &quot; 2,725,000.                                                        9.........                It is doubtful whether this aggregate figure could,           with advantage, be appreciably increased.  In addition           to the above the late Government approved (Cabinet 5 (24)           Conclusion 4) the insertion in the Eavsl Estimates for           1924-5 of the sum cf  5 millions for the construction           of Cruisers.  Tenders for the vessels have not yet been           invited, and while it should be noted that some little  time           must elapse before construction can commence it must not be           forgotten that from the purely unemployment point of           view the orders will be the most useful work which can be           undertaken in the severely distressed shipbuilding           industry.

The most important of these is the scheme for the             Manchester-Liverpool Road.   This scheme would cost             a total of  5 million and negotiations are being             conducted on the basis of a Government contribution             of 5D per cent.,   Other schemes are the North-Orbital             Road round London, and the Cherteey Road, estimated             to cost  5 million and  1,500,000 respectively.

At the same time Local Authorities were informed that             the terras on which State assistance would be granted to             approved schemes were.to-be improved in the case of certain             classes of so-called &quot;revenue producing&quot; works by increasin             from five years to fifteen years the period of grant of             50^ interest on the capital cost of the works - later this             was extended to all revenue producing works.

The response to the Committee1s circular was highly             satisfactory - Local Authorities submitted preliminary and             provisional statements of schemes amounting to over              24,000,000 on the loan basis and over  1,000,000 on the             60$ wages cost basis.   This was a marked Increase on the             response to the Committee?s circular of the previous year,             when the value of provisional schemes submitted on the loar             basis  amounted to  some   13,000,000.

The Committee, however,&apos; have recommended tothe Treasury further guarantees in excess of  1,000,000and &quot;the Treasury have expressed their willingness togive guarantees in those cages as coon as the necessaryStatutory Powers have been obtained.  One of theseguarantees is to the Government of Lithuania for 1,000,000 for the construction of certain railwaysand the construction of grain elevators.  The Committeehave also indioated to Companies the terms on which theywould be prepared to recommend guarantees.  The  total amount involved being  4,250.000 the two largest beingthe Electricity scheme of the British AluminiumCompany, and shipbuilding proposals  amounting to 1,700,000     In. response to enquiries by the UnemploymentCommittee of the late  Government,  the  Colonial Officerecently submitted certain proposals for assisting  the14 -hhhi
Illrelief of unemployment at home ,  and. at the same timedeveloping the Colonies and Protectorates in Africa.By far the most important of these proposals was one for the construction, at an est-&quot;&quot;ted cost of 6,150,GOO, of a Hallway in Kenya and Uganda to openup large cotton growing areas.  The late Government,on the recommendation of the Unemployment Committee,approved in principle the construction of this railway and requested the Treasury and the Colonial Office toexamine the financial aspects of the proposals, with aview to the scheme being financed on terms as favourableas the circumstances may permit.     The present intention is that.the assistance givento development schemes in the Crown Colonies and protectorates ahould be on the same terms as were offeredat tho recent Imperial Economic Conference to theDominions, namely the provision by the British Governmentof three-quarters of the interest for a period of five-years on loans raised for the undertakings.     These terms have bean communicated to the variousDominions concerned and are still under consideration.So far as is at present known no proposals have yetbeen received from the Dominion Governments or from thoDominion State Governments.

In this part of their Report the Oommittee submit to thecabinet their views aq to the barit rowo&amp;ioc for the immediaterelief and ultimate solution of the&apos;unemployment problem.  Owing&quot;to the very short time available  the 0onruvitee have not &quot;beenable to examine the possibilities and effects of a change ofpolioy and for the time being they fsel bound to limit theireuggeationa to little more than&apos;, an extension of the chief admin-istrative measures they have found in operation, particularly those like the Trade Facilities salw-me and the Export credits scheme, which stimulate the  development of normal trade alongnormal lines.,       In the past thetendency  of previous Governments has been to start by attempting to alleviate unemployment by the provisionOf relief works of various kinds  and after experience has shewnthe difficulty of-solving the problem on these lines% to concen-trate more and more on efforts  to revive and expand trade.  TheCommittee assume, however, that the policy of the present government will, from the start,  aim at the augmentation of thetotal volume of employment and  the consequential absorption ofthe unemployed in their own trades and industries, and that theGovernment will regard the ad hoo schemes for. the temporaryrelief of the unemployed as of  secondary importance and as being1&apos;merely supplementary expedients pending the coming into full operation of the Government&apos;a plane for providing furtherpermament employment.       It follows from this that the Government&apos;,s schemes should go on all the year round and that arrangements ahould not aim, asin the past at attaining their maximum effect in the winter months       The Committee think it necessary that emphasis should belaid on the Government&apos;a policy not being so much for the&quot;relief&quot; of unemployment aa for the. restoration of trade.Specific schemes recommended to stimulate trade or temporarily to absorb unemployed,  must be been in perspective to the Govern-menfa whole polioy both in foreign ^and internal affairs forthe restoration of the international trade on which we                        -17-                                BO
so largely depend.   The Committee are so impressed with...the Importance cf&quot; this fact, which has been too littlereocgnised in the past, that they suggest that the PrimeMinister might take tho earliest possible opportunity ofmaking it clear that the Government have nb intention of drawing off from the normal channels- ?f trade large sumsfor extemporised measures which can only be palliatives,and that the necessity of expenditure for subsidising&apos;schemes in direct relief of unemployment will be  judgedin relation to the greater necessity for maintainingundisturbed Jhe ordinary-financial-facilities - and recoursesof trade and industry.       By the end of 19S3, a.number of important  industries had made some recovery  (in one or two caseh almost complete), from the serious depression which prevailedearlier, and there seems no reason to. think that  during thefirst few months of 1924, at least, this recovery willnot be maintained.   Among these industries may be mentioned coal (which produced more than, in any otherprevious year except 1915, and exported almost as muchas in that year);  iron and steel, (whioh is benefitingby the reoehi large orders planed by the railway companies-andand the improvement, such as it is,, in shipbuilding, but may be adversely affected by intensified competition from Germany, Prance and Belgium).;  building material;pottery; &apos; leather;  and boots and shoes,    With a largehousing scheme in operation,, improvement should spread                            material from the building and building/trades  to a number ofother related Industries.      Shipbuilding deems- to  have moved from low-watermark, but the improvement, so far, Is  slight and there                       -18-
ia no proapeet of normal activity being reached forsome considerable time to some&quot;.  General engineeringis also likely to remain below normal, though some improvement maybe anticipated.   The light motor car&apos;,the textile machinery, and the heavy electrical engineering sections are those    which have beenleast unsatisfactory.   Heavy  chemicals, cement, andthe heavier branches of the miscellaneous  (non-ferrous)metal trades show signs of fair activity.  The glasswareindustry seems to have email prospects of  advance,     . The textile industries are probably  those which show the least promise of early improvement.;  Hosieryand carpets are not so unsatisfactory, but lace is verydepressed.   Silk, Jute, flax  (Dundee-canvas morethan Belfast linen) wcol and cotton are  all unsatis-fastory.  The shortage of flax due  to the  absence ofRussian supplies, and  of cotton because  of the smallAmerican crop, and the probable shortage of wool due tod,tmisished flocks of  sheep have had the  effect of main-tainizg prices at a high level,, with an  upward tendency;iaiid&quot;---in-*the^^ha-a-been^-and^^^factor?&apos;       Any  attempt at  prophecy must necessarily bevery qualified and the whole situation might be radicallyaltered should disturbing elements  arise either athome  (a.g.  serious industrial  disputes)  or abroad.      Some  Notes  on particular trades are  annexed.     *See Appendix II,
MEASURES DESIGNEDTO STIMULATE AMDEH COURAGE THEEXPANSION OPTRADE.A, ImprovedRelations withForeign Powers.     The Committee are oonvinoed that no permanent solution of the Unemployment problem is possibleuntil normal conditions of peaoe have been re-established throughout the world, and  in particular,until the relations of Great Britain with certainForeign Powers whioh, In the past, have been herimportant oustomers, have undergone Improvement.  In -this connectionj the Committee have in mind there-establishment of normal conditions in Europe andthe full resumption of political and trading relationswith Russia and certain other countries.     The Committee welcome the decision of theGovernment to grant de Jure recognition to Russia asa first step in this direction.   At the same time they are of opinion, from the information before them,that the grant to Russia of de jure recognition willnet of itself have any great Immediate effeot uponthe Unemployment situation because -       (a)  The maximum amount of trade which            could be done with Russia in any case            Is not great:       (b)  The problem of finance, without whioh            no large volume of trade is possible, is            still unsolved:       (c)  The revival of trade, must In any case            be a slow and difficult process:     The Committee also feel that the ab^ve general considerations apply, though no doubt to a muoh lessextent, to the case  of Mexico fromwhich oountrylc withheld.at present de jure recognition/The Committee
(The Committee recommend to the Cabinet *   To take note of the committee view that the   most hopeful solution of the Unemployment problem   lies in the re-establishment of normal peaceful   conditions throughout the world and in particular   In the  removal of all impediments, whether political   or otherwise to tho full re-opening of normal   trading relations with countries whero such rela-   tions do not at present exist.agd&quot;^gpo?f schemes for the artificial creation of employment or forOrsuTESo&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;relieving unemployment by payment of benefit can only beregarded as palliatives and that the only real cure is such, a revival of normal trade activity as will automaticallyre-absorb unempls^sd.workmen into their accustomed occupa-.tiona.  This revival will naturally be expedited by any-improvement in the political and economic situation in central Europe.  Apart from this, however, it would not bowise to expect too great immediate-relief from positiveGovernment measures of encouragement.   The Committee1&apos;attention, however, has been called to the operation oftwo measures;, the Export Credits Scheme and the TradeFacilities Act, both of which were expressly devised to stimulate enterprise of a kind likely to increase employmentin the United Kingdom^  Immediate legislation is necessaryto extend the period during whioh guarantees can be given under both these measures.  The Trade Facilities Bill as drafted extends the operation of the existing legislation for one -year, namely, to November 9th 1924, and should itbe decided to extend the arrangements beyond that datefurther legislation in the Autumn would be necessary, Jratmay be very difficult to enact having regard to Parliamentaryconsiderations.  It has accordingly been agreed that theBill should provide for an extention to March,1925Tta cleAs indicate5. above the Committee recognise that allfacilities
It is also proposed to extend the period of guaranteesunder the Export Credits Scheme to September, 1926,and the period during which the guarantees may remainin force to September, 1950.   Ko addition is requiredto the sum already available for Export Credits,     The Committee assume that if the financial negotiations with Soviet Russia about to be opened InLondon are successful they will be followed hy theextension of export credits and trade facilities tothat country,   No new legislation will be requiredfor thiB purpose, and the committee understand that any modification of method which may be found neoessaryIn applying the Export Credits Soheme to a countrylike Soviet Russia where foreign trade Is a Governmentmonopoly, can be made by administrative action.     The Committee recommend to the CsMnat:-   (i)    Ihet subject to the examination of the  draft         Trade Facilities Bill by tho Home  Affairs         Committee authority should be given for the         introduction of the Bill in the House of         Commons as sooc as possible after  the ro-         assembling of Earllament.

While it is true that these industries are                   suffering from the general trade depression                   there are particular causes at work in each.                   Por example, shipbuilding Is dependent en                   the requirements of shipping, and there is                   afloat several milllen tens of tonnage more                   than in 1913 at a time when the movement ef                   international trade is much below the 1913                   level.  V/hile it is true that some of this                   tonnage is obsolescent, thero is probably still                   a margin between the available tonnage and the                   required tonnage to be taken up as trade                   revives before any substantial erdars f*r new                   tonnage are likely to be placed.                        Heavy engineering is nominally carrying                   a personnel probably substantially in excess of                                                    pfaspeotive....
prospective requirements.  This is duo ofcourse to the artificial Increase of thoengineering industry caused by war work,,and the position has been intensified bythe great reduction in the market for armaments.     Tho iron and steel trade shows a percentageof unemployment of V! (a falling percentage)but according tf press reports its production is now at the level ef 1913.  This is dueprobably to the very great improvement inmechnioal plant introduced during the war.     The Cotton trade has to face the diminishedpurchasing power of valuable eastern markets andat the same time the prospect, this year, accord-ing to market reports, of a possible shortage,and/or severe increase in the price of raw cotton.     It would be difficult so far as the Committeehave been able to go at present to bring withintho ambit of any general scheme for relieving           in umemployment/trades with suoh diverse problems and accordingly the Committee recommend:-       That the President of the Board of       Trade end tho Minister &amp;t labour       should be re quiet ad to enquire and       present a joint report to the       Unemployment pommittee $a the       position and prospects of tho       abevenamed and any other basic       industries where unemployment has       been eentinuously severe over a       long period.

The Committee have requested the  Ministry  of              Transport to furnish them with particulars, of these              various  projects,  the carrying into effect  of which              necessitates Borne  consideration  of the finance  of              the  Road Fund  which is discussed in the following              paragraphs.   FUND            The actual state of  the  Road Fund on  the 31st March,pASGE.              1924,  is likely to show an excess of liabilities  over            -  assets of about  6 millions.   In future years  it is              expected that  this excess will be liquidated and will              be fully discharged by the end of 1928-9.    This              calculation, however, includes no contribution  to the              Manchester-Liverpool Road -  (the estimated  cost of              which  to the Road  Fund would  be   1-1 million on  a  50$&apos;              basis) or  other similar future undertakings, for whioh              no provision has as yet been  made,                                     -28-                                                                On/
     On tho 31at March next the Road fund till holdvery large cash reserves (over  13,000,000)  and  noquestion of borrowing to meet existing liabilitiesarises immediately in view of this fact.     The existing Statutory Borrowing Bowers of  theRoad Fund are conferred by Section 13 of  the Develop-ment and Road Improvement Funds Aot, 1909, whichempowers the Minister; with the approval  of  theTreasury, to borrow on tho security of the Road  fund for expenditure &quot;which appears to the Treasury to beof such a nature that it ought to be spread  over a  termof years, oo, however, that the total amount requiredfor thG payment of interest on and the repayment ofmoney so borrowed shall not exceed in any one year 200,000&quot;.     The question whether to exercise, or even toextend, the existing powers of borrowing  was consideredby tho late Government but it was considered that with the guarantee of Treasury cover the Road  Fund wouldbo able to finance not only its liabilities  then existing, but tho new (1924-25) programme, and alsothe Liverpool-Manchester Road.  It was therefore considered unnecessary to pursue the question of exercising tho existing powers of borrowing  or toask Parliament to extend the limit within which  theRoad Fund can borrow with a view to future exerciseof the powers so extended.                    -29-

These              taxes,  which were  imposed in  consultation with  the              industry, were  based oh the understanding that  the              money should be used for the  improvement of  roads.              The motoring industry is suspicious that the money              is  in fact  being  diverted for the relief of  unernploy-              ment which  thoy consider is not a proper charge on              tho Road fund,  The Ministry  of Transport has always              selected works  which are required in the int/rests              of  traffic  and  has only anticipated them for the              purposes of unemployment relief,  but in  any  suggestion              to  tie  up the finances of the Road  fund  for  a long              period  of years,  criticism  and  possibly  opposition              must be expected  from the motor users.                   The now motor taxation introduced by tho finance              let, 1920,  formed in effect a bargain between motor              vehicle owners, as road users,  and  the Government.              This understanding was referred to  again and again              in  the  course of  the. debates  on the Finance  Bill and              the Roads Bill.                   The Committee recommend  to the Cabinet  - &apos;                      (1) Thai  the Minister of Tran.sport should                         be  authorised -                          fa) To re-open  negotiations  with the                             Authorities interested in the                             scheme for  the  Liverpool-ManChester                             Road on  the basis that the Government                             contribution  should be fixed in                             accordance  with terms agreed between                             the Minister  and the  Treasury.
    (b)   To  prepare  for  the  consideration of         the Unemployment  Committee, a programme         of  Works  for  the  winter  1924,-25j such         programme to  Include  among other         important undertakings the Eorth         Orbital Road  and  the  new Chertsey         Road.    (c)   To  prepare  for  the  consideration of         the Unemployment  Committee a         statement as  to the practicability of         relieving&apos;unemployment by means of:-            (i)  An  extension  of  light railways,&quot;                particularly  in  Agricultural                districts.           (li)  Improvements  in  the existing                Canal system.(2)  To request  the Chancellor  of  the Exchequer    in consultation  with the Minister  of    Transport to  examine the general question    of the provision of  further financial    resources for  the  oroDosed new programme    indicated in  (1) above,  particularly with a view    to determining whether the existing  limits    within which the Road  Fund can operate, should    be extended and  if BO  in what form Parliamentary    sanction for  such extension i3 necessary.(3)  To take  note that  the  Committee propose, in the    near future, to  examine  suggestions  submitted  to    them by  the Minister of  Transport  (C.U. 636 &amp;    C.U. 637) for  undertaking  a new road and bridge    construction  programme -\nd -;lso for  stimulating    employment  by  the  improvement of existing    highways*
      The Committee have noted the very substantial measure  of unemployment relief whioh  has  resulted from the efforts of the Unemployment Grants Committee. The Committee feel,  no  doubtj  that the  Cabinet will wish the work to be  continued  generally on existing lines.      The Unemployment Grants Committee  were authorised to  approve  for  grant works carried out  by  loan, oommenced during tho Autumn and  Winter  of  1923/24 up  to a  total capital oost of  20,000,000.  They have approved  over  14,250,000 worth  of suoh works and&apos;&apos;have under consideration further schemes to  the value of  4,250,000 making a total figure of  18,500,000. More schemes are coming in daily and it is probable that the figure  of  20,000,000 to which their authorisation.- tion extends will be reached  if not exceeded  in the course of the next few weeks.     The Committee propose to consider, in consultation with the Unemployment Grants  Committee  certain of the conditions upon which grants  are at present made  witha view to seeing whether any  relaxation of the conditions is desirable.     It will also be necessary for the  Committee  to make an early recommendation  as to. the total  capital valueof works carried out by  loan  which the  unemployment grants Committee will be authorised to  aid  in  thecoming Financial year.   As indicated above  thecorresponding figure for the  Autumn and  winter of1923/24  was  i:2O,000,000  and on the information atpresent  before them,  the Committee think that  sanction for an amount not less than this figure  will berequired.
The Committee recommend to  the  Cabinet - (i)     That in order that the Unemployment  Grants      Committee may be able to continue to  assist      Bchemes on the loan basis,  the  Committee may be      authorised to exceed the oxisting limit of       20,000-000 (the total value  of such  schemes      to bo assisted in 1923-24 by  a  further sum of      1:2,000^000 making  22,000,000 in all).(ii)     That the Cabinet should  approve in principle-      the polioy of assisting works starting in the      Spring and Summer months.                        \iii)     That the Treasury,  the Ministry of Health,     : the Scottish Office and the Unemployment      Grants Committee be authorised  to formulate      proposals regarding the financial provision      to be made during 1924/25 in  respect  of the      Committee&apos;s various sohemes with a view      to the issue of a circular  to Local Authorities      early in March 1924;(iv)     That the Unemployment  Grants Committee      be requested to submit for  the  consideration      of the Unemployment Committee a memorandum      on the proposals and  difficulties of  the      present schemes under  whioh financial      assistance may be given to  Public  Utility      Undertakings.-32^-
        The latest-analysis of the Ministry of&quot;Labour of the industrial distribution of unemployment on the Slat December 1923 shows that 270,000 females were unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland out of an insured population of 2,975,000, a percentage of 9.1 as compared with a corresponding percentage for males at that date of 1103.   Of this figure the textile trades  inoludinj textile bleaching and dyeing account for about 93,003;  the clothing trades,, pacticu- larly tailoring and dross and mantle, making and millinery for 38,000;  the distributive trades for S3.00C and hotel, boarding house and club services, which are of course&apos; affected by seasonal considerations, for a further 21,000.  It is obviously a very diffioult problem to devise &quot;relief schemes&quot; applicable to women, and so    far    it has only been possible to make arrangements for different types of domestic training.  The Committee understand that the Central Committee on Women&apos;s- Training and Employment are considering the matter and will shortly be making proposals to the Ministry of Labour on the possibility of finding employment for some of the unemployed women and these proposals will receive immediate consideration. Financial provision for these schemes will have to be made and the Committee propose to consider this question in the near future.   -                 *
(/millI0YL1UT.RI CULTURAL LCILOX-BMT.   i  The Committee recommend to the Cabinet -          That a Committee composed of representatives of          the Treasury, the Board of education, the          Scottish education Department and the Linistry          of Labour be authorised to prepare a Report          for the consideration of the Unemployment          Committee on the whole question of Juvenile          Unemployment,, regard being had to matters such.          as the extension of the system of Juvenile          Unemployment centres, the lowering of the age          limit in the- Unemployment Insurance  ^ot and          the raising of the school-leaving age,     /hile some Unemployment undoubtedly exists incertain rural areas,  the question is not so abnormal andacute as in the towns and is largely bound up with  thelarger problems of agricultural depression which isunder the consideration of the agricultural PolicyCommitti e.       ci: 1 causes such as the  CattleSlaughtering policy no doubt tend to swell the  volumeof rural unemployment.   The Committee, consider that,pending further investigation,  the best policy will be tocontinue the  existing relief schemes for which additionalfinancial provision in respect of the  current year willhave to be made.     The Committee recommend to the Cabinet  -     (1) That the- Linister of agriculture and : fishieries         should be authorised to expend a further sum         (over and above the   250,000         authorised by the late Government and now ex-         exhausted on commitments) in assisting outstanding         land drainage works in relief of unemployment a-v         that work on the schemes be allowed to continue         until 20tn June, 1924,     (2) That the joottish Board of Agriculture should be         authorised to expend a further sum         (over and above the sum of  50,125         already provided) for assisting works of lana         drainage&apos;, farm water supplies and improvements t         farm roads in  Scotland, and that work  on the         schemes be  allowed to continue until Sotfci June .

As regards the normal Departmental Estimates for 1924/2!?              the position speaking generally is that those estimates              are still under consideration and that should the Cabinet              decide to increase the provision at present made in the              various Estimates for unemployment relief the necessary              alterations could be effected.d)*   R.B.

Imports of raw materials  in  1928 were in        every quarter better than in 1922 and though tne impulse of the.        Ruhr died out, the fourth quarter showed a revival on the        third.  -  The imports of iron ore ware in that quarter nearly        72$ of the quarterly average for 1913,  British exports also        were Better than in 1922 and again the fourth quarter showed a        revival on the reaction of the third and was only slightly        behind the total of the second.  The revival was most        noticeable in the more finished classes of tinplatea, galvanised        sheets, railway material, &amp;o.  Prospects, for 1924 appear bright,.jiohlnery.           Competing imports are not important except in a few        classes.    The loss in exports during the summer was nearly made        good in the fourth quarter whioh was only 2,00G tons behind        the first.   This revival, should aontjnue. as steel production        has increased.ihioles.            Exports of motor oars ana oyoles increased progressively        tkrougb the year, and those of looomotiveswere greatest in        the fourth quarter.

Retained imports of raw cotton in the fourth quarter        of 1923 were nearly 16$ greater than those in the fourth quarter        of 1922, but owing to the short American crop and higher prices        it appears doubtful whether the aggregate imports of last        yoar will be equalled.  Outlook bad.I01,               Retained imports of sheep&apos;a and lambs&apos;  wool in the        second half of 1923 were less than one-fifth of those of the        first half.
