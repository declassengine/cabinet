The Bill will require to &quot;be introduced on a financial resolution and as in the absence of powerto guarantee approved schemes are actually &quot;being--held -up it is a matter of urgency to introduce this resolutionas soon as the House meets.     Clause I - ax tension of Trade Facilities Acts.         - The Trade Facilitios ,v.cts 1921 and 1922authorised the Treasury after consultation with thoAdvisory Committee appointed thereunder to guarantee thepayment of the interest and principal or of either interest or principal of loans to bo applied towards the carrying-                                                     outT11IS  BOCUIEHT  IS  TSD P30P1ETY 0?

 out $f  capital undertakings  or  in tho  purchase of articles manufacture&amp; in  the United  Kingdom  required for the purposes  of any such undertakings,           The aggregate capital  amount of  the  loans, the principal or  interest&quot;of which might ho  guaranteed under    1 the Acts^was  50,000,000.   Tho  period during  which  guarantees  1                                                                11 could he given expired  on November 9th 1923  up to which date guarantees to the  amount of   38,205,645 had  been  givon, leaving authority for  11,794,355 unused.           The Bill proposes (1)  to extend  the  period during which guarantees may &quot;be given to November.  9th,  1924 and (2) to increase the total of   50,000,000 to  65,000,000. It will accordingly permit of guarantees being givon inrespect of further loans amounting to   26,794,355.      Clause II,  - Bnpire Development.          This clause proposes to  carry  out thescheme suihmitted to the &quot;Committee  on lunanoial Co-operation for&apos; assistance towards Imperial Development and adoptedby the Imperial Confereace.    The clause provides  thatthe Treasury may, if certain conditions  are &quot;complied with, undertake to pay for a period not  exceeding 5 years to the Government of any part of His Majesty&apos;sDominions an amount not exceeding three-quarters of theinterest payable on such part of a loan  as is expendedin tho United Kingdom.   The Dominion Government will beresponsible for payment to the ultimate  recipient oftho grant.                                           *&apos;                                                   TheaiMMMIIUnmuuuuljmmnauMua.....JIIII
          Hie aggregate amount which may he paid hy the     2u[Treasury in any one year is limited to  1,000,000 and; thetotal contrihution to     5,000,000 and no undertaking mayhe given hy the Treasury after three years from the coHoenee-ment of the Act.           The Bill provides that the loans must ho appliedto capital expenditure on or in connection with a publicutility undertaking in some part of the Dominions in accord-ance with a scheme approved hy the Government of the Dominion,and that the expenditure on the scheme must he expenditure which would not normally&apos; he incurred until a later date.     Clause III ^ Guarantees under Overseas Trade Acts.          Under tho Overseas Trade Acts 1920-1922 as extendedhy the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act, 1923, the Board ofTrade were authorised hy Parliament to make arrangements inconnection with export trade for granting credits and givingguarantees to an amount not exceeding  25,000,000 such creditsand guarantees to he granted before the 3th day of September,1924, and to he liquidated not later than the 8th day ofSeptember, 1927.          It is proposed that power should be taken toauthorise the Board to jive guarantees up to tho 8th September,1925, to be liquidated before tho 8th September, 1930.  Itis not necessary to alter the maximum liability of  26,000,000.       Clause IV  ^ Soudan Guaranteed Xoan^          By the&apos; Tr--.de Pacilitiea and loans Guarantee Act,1922, the Treasiiry were authorised to guarantee the                                                  principal
   principal of and  Interest on any loan raised by the Govem-   ment of the  Soudan  for irrigating the Gezireh Plain for   cotton growing  not  exceeding an amount sufficient to raise    3,500,000.   The position then (December 1922) was that   tho Soudan Government had spent the  6.,000,000 raised u:.c.or   British  grantee:  under  the Act of 1919, and that it would   cost another  7,000,000 at least to complete.  . It was   impossible while  the  relations  of Egypt and  the Soudan   remained  undetermined  for the Soudan to hope to raise tho   money on  their  own  credit.    It was decided  to guarantee    3^- millions of the  7,000,000  required,  tho idea being   that by the  time  the  balance was required tho Soudan   Government might  be able  to raise it by realisation of   assets or that  by that time the relations between Egypt and   the Soudan would  have  been settled and. the Soudan Government   would have been able, to raise a loan on,-its  own credit,   It   is now clear that neither alternative is pds&amp;ible and it is   necessary therefore to guarantee a loan for  the balance re-   quired to complete  the scheme.   It is proposed therefore that   the guarantee shall be for an amount sufficient to raise a   further  3,500,000, making  7,000,000 in all under the Act of   1922, subject to  the  limits and conditions laid down in the   1922 Act.
