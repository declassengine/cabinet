I have had careful investigation made into theprobable effect upon Admiralty interests of the draft agreement between the British Dyeatdffs corporation and the German Intersssen (Jems ins c haft, and I circulate herewith a Note of the Admiralty views, for the infor-mation of ray col le agues0                           (Intld.)    0uWEHo. 71(24)6th gehmary 19
  JIOTE OH THE ADMIRALTY YLEW ON TffiJ PROPOSED   A&amp;KEEivlEIT BEMBES $HE BRITISH AGREEMENTBETWEEN 1113 BRITISH AND ($$WAS MS CORPORATIONSMLRALTYterest ina chemicaldnstry.eQt of theseraeat on Isvelop-J of theTISH   T.         The proposed agree merit is one of which the falleffaots will not &quot;be immediately apparent, and  the positionwhioh is talcea hy the Admiralty in regard to it and its effect on national security, is governed by their estimateof the probable coarse of events daring the period of theagreement.         It mast he evident that the Admiralty are vitallyconcerned in the welfare of the chemical industry,   Theydepend upon it for explosives, the materials used inoffensive ohetnical warfare and anti-gas arrangements, inmedicine and sanitations   The properties of explosivessuch as rate of &quot;burning, stability and destructive power,the toxic properties of liquids and gascjs and the aabsorbent powers of certain solids are discovered and improved, not only be researches in tho laboratory, hatby those in the factory.   The &quot;safety&quot; element in manu-facture is almost entirely a factory problem.   In time ofwar, it is the whole chemical industry of the country whichwill be required to meet the nation&apos;^ needs as regardsadequate supplies and rapid expansion, after general andfactory research has proceeded sufficiently far to enableproduction of the required chemicals to Toe undertaken atonoe on a large scale,   The Admiralty are therefore opposedto any agreement whioh tends to reduoo the security of thiscountry by jeopardising the supply? in war-time of essentialsabstances produced hy the chemical industry.        *         In examining&apos; the effect of the proposed agreement upon the chemical Industry, it is important to notice that, according to the proposals under examination,  the                                               fie Id.....
                             li                                 m        field for home-produced dye-strife arid by-produots is limited        to the home market and half (1) the colonial market, i6e9        we are debarred from competition in fields where the        greatest expansion is likely to occur,&apos; and we effectively        limit our production and stifle the growth of our industry.        It is also certain that German dyes, which either cannot be        produced in this country owing to lack of intermediariess        or can be produced far more cheaply in Germany, will find a        large market in this country for use at.home and for export        to the colonies s thus again handicapping home production,,        It is improbable that the cost of production in this country      &apos;  will be as low as in Germany and it is believed that the        BoD0 would eventually obtain many I2G0 products for sale        in this country and the Dominions:,  It appears from the        Agreement that if the B,,Da manufactured nothing it would        possess sole selling rights of 1-6* products in the home        market and could pay dividends,,  It appears therefore that        the German industry, starting with the enormous advantages        of a high degree of organisation and an already great out-        put , would flourish greatly at the expense of a weekly and        discouraged British industry,., so that the latter would,        after even less than fifty years, become  an affair of        negligible magnitude and the supply of chemical munitions        of war would be inadequate0Is not             From the Admiralty standpoint this view of thef toft ion,   probable trend of the industry is sufficiently serious,  but onjeko     there is a further and more far-reaching  effect of the        shrinking output  and profit.  It is perhaps a large assump-        tion, but for the moment  let us assume that the exchange of        secrets is completely and honestly carried out  The  gainof British Industry is only a temporary one   The  futureof o .
                      -   of the Industry depends upon progress  and the rate of progress is determined largely hy the  number and ability of the research workers,   A great and prosperous industry can afford to spend more money on research and its rate of increase is therefore greater, in proportion, than that of its smaller rivals.   This means that the German Industry will soon &quot;be again in &quot;the possession of a number of secrets no less valuable than those they propose to hand over, and there is no guarantee that these secrets willbe of no military value - in fact all  indications point to the contrary(  for their funds and opportunities for discovery will ha proportionally greater than oars, the greater is their chemical trade,   They would undoubtedly engage in research and manufacture of  explosives and chemical warfare  materials, knowledge  of which would notbe communicated to us (interchange of  information is limited to the domostio market) hut might he commuiiicated to an s nemyu         This agreement applies tovby-products as well as to dye-staffs, for the chemical industry of a country is anarticulated structure in which each link connects many parts,,   The  movements of the whole  structure are dater-minecl hy those of a master member or hey chemical industry.   This centre of the chemical industry In Germany is the dye industry, and there is a strong tendency for an increasing&apos; number of substances to be  derived from some process or stage  of dye-production,,    It seems therefore that an agreement of the  kind proposed would, before manyyears have passed, have removed from our hands the possibility of competing with Germany, in certain markets, in the sale of an unexpectedly large number of &quot;by-products of the dye industry.
