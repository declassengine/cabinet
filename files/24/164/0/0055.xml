.V24     Note by the Secretary of State for India.                    ClANPHI.          The Governor of Bombay telegraphs to theViceroy that Moderate Liberals will support theresolution for Gandhi&apos;s release to be moved In theAssembly on February 5th.          The Governor is strongly of opinion that theposition of the Government will be weakened by theoffer of any conditions to Gandhi, as the conditionsare certain to be refused.   The Governor notes:-     (a) The universal character of the demands throughout India from all sections of political opinion:     (b) His belief that Gandhi would exercise arestraining Influence on the All brothers;     (c) That his release might he a set-back to theSwaraj party;     (d) His return to prison might easily lead to theoutbreak of violence which, in view of the present industrial situation in Bombay would probably lead to amost serious position;     (e) His release would greatly facilitate the smoothworking of the Assembly and the Council.          Under all the circumstances and In view of thestate of Gandhi&apos;s health, and of his known inclination no;;to take part in politics for some considerable time, theGovernor of Bombay asks that authority may be given to                                                   himTHIS DOCUMENT IS THS PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot; S                       GOVERNMENT                          /&apos;
3952*him to announce that &quot;the Governor In Council has decidedunder section 402, Code of Criminal Procedure to rornitthe further term of Mr. M.K. Gandhi1 s imprisonment,,&quot;He adds &quot;that it is probable that Colonel Maddock will get an undertaking on medical grounds from Mr. Gandhithat he will not take part in politics for six months.&quot;          On this the Viceroy refers to the opinion he expressed in paragraph 2 of his telegram of the 25thJanuary, namely, &quot;We are profoundly impressed with thepractical certainty of recrudescence of agitation anddanger of revival in some form of its gravest aspects,such as mass Civil Disobedience, end we consider that no action on other than medical grounds would he warrantedwhich did not give sufficient safeguard against such aneventuality.&quot;   He will, however 11 consider tho situationfurther in the light of the Bombay Government&apos;s reply,to whose opinion as the Local Government most directly and intimately concerned, wo must naturally attach great weight.   It may be anticipated from the contents of theirtelegram that their opinion will be largely influenced bythe strike &quot;situation in Bombayi which may have rapiddevelopments..   In view of this and of the fact thatthere may be some delay in-receiving their reply, while our attitude must be determined before the meeting ofthe Assembly on the 5th, we may find it necessary to announce our decision without previous reference to you,but we shall apprise you without delay of its terms.&quot;.
