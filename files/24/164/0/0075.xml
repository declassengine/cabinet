Afl,alrsi Committee),    MERCHANT SHIPPING ( INTERNATIONAL LABOUR  CONVENTIONS? BILL-,        Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     This is a Bill to give effect to certain international conventions for the benefit of Merchant Seamen,     The Conventions in question are three in number,  and were adopted by the International Labour Organisation of the League ofNations in 1920 and 1921.  They are:-     (1) Convention regarding Unemployment Indemnity  for Seamen          on loss of vessel, adopted in 1920.  This provides          that a seaman&apos;s wages shall run on for a maximum period          of two months from the date of the loss of his ship,     (2) Convention fixing minimum age for trimmers and stokers          employed on shipboard:  this was adopted in  1921, and          fixes the minimum age at 18.     (3) Convention regarding medical examination of young persons          employed at sea, adopter! in 1921:  this provides for          the. medical examination of boys  under 18 before they car          serve on board ship, and thereafter once a year till          they reach the age of 18,     The three Conventions were signed by (among others) all theBritish representatives at the respective Conferences  i.e.  therepresentatives of the Government, the employers and the seamen,but they have not been ratified by His Majesty1s Governmentpending legislation necessary to give effect to them.     Under the present law, a seaman&apos;s right to wages  terminateswhen his ship is lost, and this causes a certain amount of hardship.  The idea at the back of the first Convention is  thatthe man should continue to receive wages until he has time  to get back home to be able to look for employment again.   For thispurpose a maximum of two months&apos;  wages Is  allowed.   Thisalteration of the law will be welcomed by the mea1s  representatives and will probably not be opposed strongly by the shipowners..   Theother two Conventions will not be so strongly pressed for by the
   men,  and will not be opposed by the  owners.        The adoption of these  Conventions  means  altering  the   Merchant Shipping Acts, and the present  Bill makes  the  necessary   alterations in these Aots&apos; for the purpose of giving effect  to   these throe Conventions.        A point has been raised on Sub-Clause 2 of Clause  1  of   the draft Bill, as to whether the onus of proving that  a   particular man was or was not employed should  he placed on  the   owner of the ship or on the nan.  It would not be a very  work-   able  arrangement, or altogether fair, to place on the seamen   the onus of proving that he was not  employed,  and it is pro-   posed to enact that the men  shall get wages for two months,   with a proviso that If the owner shows that, the man was in   employment during any part of that periods wages shall  not  be   payable by him for such days,        I suggest that an early opportunity might be taken of   introducing and proceeding with this Bill,                                             S.W.Board of Trade,   6th February, 1924.
