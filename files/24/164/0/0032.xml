                                                         &apos;  2sr               The Anglo-Persian Oil  Company was formed to develop     certain oil  concessions granted  by the Persian Government over     a large part of Persia for a term of years which expires in     1961 in 37 years from the present date.   In 1914 His Majesty&apos;s     Government with a view to securing supplies of oil fuel for     the Havy not only entered into a long term contract with the     Company for  the supply of oil fuel but also subscribed under     Parliamentary powers for  2,000,000 ordinary shares besides      200,000 in  Debentures and Preference shares.   Two Government     Directors with special powers are on the Board of Directors,     Since the war, the Government has subscribed for further     issues of ordinary share capital to the amount of  3,000,000,     making 5,000,000 ordinary shares.               The object of the original investment (and of the.7419. subsequent additions thereto) as set forth in the Blue book     was &quot;to secure that at least one  large British OH Company     shall be maintained, having independent control of considerable     supplies of  natural petroleum and bound to the Government     by financial and contractual obligations&quot;,      It is     interesting  to note that the original investment by Government     was made from the fear that otherwise the Oilfields would     fall into the hands of the Royal-Dutch Group.               The Admiralty supply contract is for 5OO5OC0 tons     of oil fuel  a year at a price of 30/- f ,o.b.  Abadan (a price     which is subject to a rebate down to 20/- if the Company     pays dividends over 10%.)                                                      *  The
9   A/SOU -          The present scale of the anglo 0*. Persian Oil  ;Company^ transactions may be indicated by a few figures:its total paid kp capital was at 31st March, 1923, over 19,300,000, besides  4,625,000 Debentures;  its asseteappear in the Balance Sheet at jjust undef1  40,000,000:its production in 1922/23 was 2,959,028 tons:  It owns the shares in whole or part of some 15 to 20 associated companies:  its fleet comprises some 240 vessels of nearlyi million tons.   It is now the&apos; third largest of the  greatOil Companies. ,          The Blue&apos;-book before alluded to refers to thetendency  &apos;for the oilfields of the world and the marketing of their products to fall more and more under the controlof comparatively few concerns&apos;.   The 2 largest of thesecombines  are the Standard Oil Company and the Shell - RoyalDutch group-.   The latter,, group hold  (in-proportions  40 Shell60 Royal  Dutch), shares In the various-companies in theirgroup.    The preponderating influence is therefore Dutch,In 1916 and again in 1918 suggestions were  considered for^bringing  about a combination of British oil companies with a view to securing a predominating British influence   Lover the  Royal Dutch group, but on each occasion the  projerf-&apos;/:proved abortive.   In 1922 proposals were put forward fora merger  in a single combine of the Shell - Royal Dutch -.                                                Burmah
Burraah Oil and Anglo-Persian Oil Companies.   A CabinetCommittee was appointed to consider the proposals whichwere held almost necessarily to involve the sale by theGovernment of its Anglo-Persian shares, but advised theCabinet not to authorise the Anglo-persian Company toenter such a combine.   The Committee did not consider that under the scheme an effective and permanent control whichwould be exercised continuously in British national interestscould be secured, the fact being that British control isa term to which it is difficult to attach a very precisemeaning when applied to a commercial company conductingits business for profit.          The rejection of the suggested merger did notlong remain unchallenged..   In October last new proposalsdiffering but little from those of 1922 were put forwardhja the Burmah Oil Company.   Although the offer comesostensibly from the Bum ah Oil Company which is a largeshareholder of the Anglo-Persian Company and has 2 directorson the Board, it is obvious that the Shell Company is thereal author of the proposal.   Nor is their motive difficultto discover:  the Anglo-Persian Company is the fortunatepossessor of a large oil field with abundant supplies ofcheaply produced oil.   Their products compete increasinglywith those of the Shell Company  both  in                                           British
British and Eastern markets, and the Shell Company musthave oil.             The main features of the offer are:-1. The payment of a price substantially in excess of the   current market price of the ordinary shares for the   British Government&apos;s holding of 5,000,000 shares.8.  the formation of a combine consisting of the Burmah   Oil, Anglo-Persian, Shell end Koyal Dutch Companies,   each maintaining a separate existence but under a Committee   with a British majority controlling it,  British interests   to represent 51,&quot;! and Dutch 49$ of the whole.3:. A &apos;guarantee&apos;  of the Admiralty supply contract with the   Anglo-Persian Company,  which would not be dependent as at   present on the Eersian oil fields but would extend over the   whole area of the combine&apos;s production.             Apart from the financial aspect of the offer,  it   would have enabled the  Government to sever connection   with a trading company and thus avoid certain   embarrassments both commercial and diplomatic which are        j   inevitably involved by such a connection.             Moreover in the 18 months which had elapsed                                                                 ; I   since the examination of the previous proposals,  oil   prices had fallen,  the  value of the shares had gone                                                                  I   down from 4 to 2f,  the  Anglo-Persian Company was   supposed to have lost large sums in unsuccessful attempts     jj   to find oil elsewhere than in Persia and by costly   developments during periods of high prices,  and rumours of   mismanagement, were freely circulated.                   .&quot;             lord Inchcape one of the Government Directors                                                                 I   who  was invited to get  into touch with the combine                                                  ascertained    !1                                                                 -1
 ascertained that they were prepared to offer a price somewhere between 3f and 4 for the 5,000,000 Government- shares.   This price he considered satisfactory:  it would place a sum of &quot;between  15 aM 20 million (of which  5 or  ^ perhaps 10 million would be paid at once) in the hands of the Government which at 5$ would represent nearly  1,000,000 a year on an original investment of  5 million.   His advice was however 6f course subject to all Admiralty requirements being completely satisfied.           Discussions therefore proceeded between the Admiralty officials and the  representatives  of the proposed combine.    It  soon appeared  that the Admiralty had much to lose and  little to gain by the  proposal.   The Admiralty contract  of    million tons a year represents only about 40$ of their  annual consumption.    The remaining 60$ they have to purchase  in the open market.    The formation into a single group of  the 4 Companies would  enable  the  group,  together with the  Standard  Oil Company,  practically to  control  the oil  fuel  supply of  the  whole  world.    The  loss  of bargaining power  which  this would  mean  to  the  Admiralty would certainly result in  higher prices being charged  for  oil  fuel.    This might  in    few years neutralise the whole  profit  on  tho  sals of the shares.   Moreover  the &quot;guarantee of  their contract on the whole output  of  the combine&quot; proved to be  entirely illusory.   It merely meant that  if  the Persian oil  fields give out,  the  Admiralty would be  free  to buy from the  combine at market  prices the  oil whioh they require.    But this of,course they would always be free  to do.           The  representatives of  the combine made  it ^uite clear  that they were  not prepared to increase the  contract supply at  a fisod price.   Tho whole argument of  the admiral&quot; was  set out in a Cabinet paper circulated by lir. Amery. Generally  the  conclusion was  that from a naval point of view the propos-il was entirely unsatisfactory.
          It might however  he represented that  the  losses of tho Anglo-Persian Company had been  so  heavy or  their fiancial position through mismanagement  or otherwise had become so precarious  hat tho Government had.  hotter soli their shares lest a worse fate befall  it.    Such  enquiries HB have been mado do not justify those apprehensions.   it- appears undeniable that the value of tho  Company&apos;s assets,  owing  after a drastic writing down to meet losses  or inflated costs during periods of high prices are well  ooBered by the real value of their properties,  particularly those of the oil-producing Companies.   Their organisation has bsen recently overhauled,  and unsuccessful experimentshave been closed down.          During the past year,  oil prices have boon low owing to the immense expansion of American production especially in California,  which has more  than offset the failure of the Mexican fields.    There  are indications that this production is falling  off and that prices will rise again.    As Id. a gallonon petrol represents from  650,000/ 75Q,000 and Id. a gallon on Kerosene represents from  25G,000/ 350,000 to the Company&apos;s revenue,  it will readily be seen thata riso in prices should ouiolrly bring increased prosperityto the Company,  particularly as  the  unit of increase ordocreaso in prices has been 3d.  a gallon.                                                 The
         The same figures will illustrate forcibly howimmensely it would be to the Shell Company&apos;s advantage to bring about an amalgamation which will eliminatetroublesome competition and enable them, in agreementwith the standard Oil Company,  to adjust the productionand price of oil in the manner best suited to their commercial interest.     A rise of Id. a gallon onPetrol alone means to the Shell Company nearly a millionpounds a year.    If they could put up the price by l/-a gallon they would recover in a single year on theirown sales, half as much again as the whole premium theyare prepared to pay for the Anglo-Persian shares,  apartfrom all other sources of profit.          There is little doubt that the formation ofsuch a combine as proposed would have serious reactionsfor the private consumer, and alarmed protests havealready been received from various quarters.    It maybe argued that the Government as the vendor of the shareBneed not consider the general interests of privateconsumers throughout the country, who muet be left toprotect themselves as best they can.   But the government must surely look at the broader economic aspects of itsaction, and the present Government could perhaps least ofall shelter itself behind the plea that the transactionwas purely a commercial one-.    The Shell Group is a powerful and - if half what is  said about it be true -a not too scrupulous combine which would not hesitate to reooup itself for its outlay in purchase of Government                                             shares
shares by any additional charges it found itself in aposition to impose on the public.        The bearing of the proposed sale on the que2tfi h ;of-unemployment must also be considered.    The Anglo-Persian Oil Company maintain a large oil&apos; refinery,atIlandarcy near Swansea,   They also maintain the Scottishshale oil industry which is at present vrorking at a loss.The proposed combine have stated plainly their view thatthe refining of crude oil in these islands is uneconomicand would have to be put down.    The same reasoning mightno doubt apply to the Scottish shale oil industry,  and nodoubt large economies would also be effected in the staff employed by the British Petroleum Company, which is therival distributing agency which markets the Anglo-Persianproducts in this country.           Finally as regards British control over the oil combine, the intention appears to be to appoint aCommittee of 9, of whoa 4 would represent the &quot;loyal Dutch,3 Shell, and 2 ^urmah and Anglo-Persian interests,  thushaving a majority of 5 to 4 British.  -  The connection between the Shell and the ^oyal Dutch hae, however, been so clone that it. would be necessary to make sure that the composition of the Committee did not in fact mean 7foreign to 2 British representatives.          The late Government considered the question atone of  their final Cabinets, but decided that it was amatter which in normal circumstances a Committee wouldhave bean set up to consider, and therefore left it over.          If the Government deoide not to part with the shares, they will of course run the risk that the sharesmay Deo^^alualsss either by a failure of the Persian                                              oilIrk              .                           &apos;:    ; li
oil field or by political disturbances in Persia, or throughmismanagement by the Company in the face of keen commercialrivalry.   Advocates of the combine oan fairly point cut, thatreliance on a single field imperils in the event of itsfailure the whole structure of refining&quot;,transporting and distributing agencies built on the production.          The failure of the field is a possibility as theexperience of l.exico demonstrates but the scientific advicereceived is that so far from there being any indication of failure all the signs go to show the existence of anexceedingly large and extensive supply of oil which may welllast for the full period of the concession.   liany wellshave been proved but kept as a reserve.   Tho area of the concession is so large that to speak of it ap a single fieldis in itself rather misleading.          The geographical situation of&apos;tho field, thoobvious.interest of the Persian Government in the maintenanceof a reliable source, of revenue which they derive fromrealties,  and the similar interest of the Bakhtiari Khans in whose actual territory the present wells are situated are thebest protection against political disturbance.          The Government by means of their representation onthe Board can watch the course of the Company&apos;s trading operations.   There is no reason, in view of the richness ofits oil field and the increasing dependence of the world on oil deposits why it should not be able to hold itB own.           The conclusion of the Treasury on v. careful reviewof all tho arguments for and against the proposed transactionis that it ought to be unhesitatingly rejected, and theproposed purchasers should be told that on no account willHis
                                                      2p this Majesty&apos;s Government part with the shares.    Such a,decision should he announced publicly as soon as possible.as the uncertainty causes much injury to the interests &apos;of the Anglo-Persian Company,G,L,B,
