[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1924.SECRET.CP. 97 (24).                                                                  ICABINET.PROPOSED IMPERIAL ECONOMIC  COMMITTEE.              Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies-.    I HAVE had some preliminary discussion on  this with the Chancellor  of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade, and  I was at  first inclined to share the view that it would be desirable to accept the recommendation of the ImperialEconomic Conference (Cmd. 1990, pp.  18-19)  that a standing Economic Committeeshould be set up.    I have,  however, subsequently  had an opportunity of  reading the discussions atthe Conference, and  particularly the objections taken (see  Cmd. 2009, pp. 573-4)  hythe Canadian  representative  (Mr. Graham),  and I have  now come to the definite conclusion that it would be unwise to proceed with  the establishment of a committee with a general reference such as that contemplated by the Conference.    I feel  that such a body  would,  almost  inevitably,  become either completelyineffective or else politically dangerous.    At the same time, I suggest  that the Government, if  it decides not to proceedwith the proposal for a standing Economic Committee, should make it quite clear thatit would  welcome the establishment of ad hoc Committees, on which all or some ofthe Dominion Governments would  be represented, as well as  His Majesty&apos;s Government,to  consider  any questions or groups of questions which were agreed  by the Govern-ments concerned to require co-operation in enquiry with a view to action.                                                                   J. H. T.    Colonial Office, February 9, 1924.11219]
