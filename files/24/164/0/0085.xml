CP. &quot;84(24).                   HOIK  AFFAIRS  CCLMITTLh&apos;,,                     The Pacific Qable Bill.        i emorandum &quot;by  the Secretary  of State for  the&apos;Colonies.              legislation will he required this session to carry out     the decision to  lay new cables and to set up  new wireless     stations in the  Zest Indies in partnership with the. Canadian     Government.   This legislation was drafted for the proposed     session last autumn, but no opportunity arose to introduce it.              The question of improving telegraphic communications     with the Lesser Antilles and British Guiana has been engaging     the attention of the Governments of the United iCingdom, of     Caneda and of the Colonies concerned, for some years.     The present service to the Leeward Islands,  the Windward     Islands, Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana is at present     provided by the  /est India and ranania Tel-graph Company,  which     receives subsidies amounting to  26,300 a year from the United    Kingdom, Oanada and the   i st Indies under a contract which will     expire on the 30th sept-mber,  1924.    The  service has however     been subject to frequent, and on occasions  prolonged,  interruption-     tions, causing considerable  economic losses to the Colonies,  and     arousing great dissatisfaction.    The cables are old and the     Company is hampered by an agreement with another Company (the     Cuba Submarine Company)  to whom it has to pay a royalty on all     messages, whether sent over the wires of that Company or not,     and, apart from tin- fact that the existing  cables will not*     last much longer, it is essential to provide  a new system     Of telegraphic communications free from this entanglement.              If the new system is not in operation by September     next year all the Colonies except Barbados  will be deprived                                                      /of
cablos and the wireless stations have -therefore been orderedat a cost of some  305,000 in order to be ready by nextSeptembero          The Governments concerned have agreed to ask the pacific Gable Board to operate tho system when established as their  qgents and at 1heir  expense.   The Board have been approached and have agreed to take over the management ofthe System subject to the consent of the Governments repre-sehted on the Board - these Governments being the UnitedKingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.          As all the Colonies concerned whose total  tradeamounts to some  25,000,000 will be deprived of telegraphiccommunication after September unless the new system is inoperation it is essential that  arrangements should becompleted to enable the Board to take over the system at theearliest possible date.    As the present powers of  the Boardaro not sufficient to enable them to take over the systemwithout legislation amending the acts under : hich the board was constituted., authority is sought for the introductionearly this session of a Bill to  confer the necessary powerson the Boards          The opportunity has at the same time been takento draft  tho Bill in the form which .will enable the  PacificCablo Board, provided that iho consent of the partnerGovernments, represented on tho Board, is first obtained to operate any other- system of cables or viroloss telegraphyon behalf of any of the Governments of His Hajesty&apos;sDominions *   It is not at present contemplated however th*atthe Board should be asked to undertake any v.ork other thancablo and  wireless communications in the West Indies*          It will bo noticed that tho Bill provides  that                ,&apos;.-&apos;&apos;;:.:               i- /&apos;  I        &quot;the&apos; .: :                         - 2  -  .      i
 the accounts of any work thereby undertaken are to be kept separate  and distinct from the other accounts of tho Board and the Board sill thus not be able to touch the Reserve Fund constituted under existing legislation.           The op;:ortunity has at the same time beon taken in Clause 1 (2) of the Bill to introduce a clause legalising the action, already taken by the Board (with the consent of the Governments represented ther :-on) in connection with the two cables worked by the C-government of the United Kingdom between that country and Canada.           Clause 1 (3) of the Bill also requires explanation. At the present moment the Vest India and Panama Telegraph Company are Under  so obligation to provide a daily news bulletin to the West Indian Colonies,   This bulletin contains  a summary of current events and also of market4-quotations in Hew Yorko   The bullet in-is made up by the Halifax and Bermuda Cable Company  at Halifax from Canadian newspapers  aid is telegraphed  to J arnica, where it is bought by tho vest India and Panama Telegraph Company and then transmitted over their system to the Colonies of the Looward Islands, Grenada,  St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana.  There are at present no special press rates to  the Viost Indies  aid these Colonies are almost entirely dependent for news upon the daily bulletin which is thus transmitted over tho cables of the IVest India and Panama Telegraph Company.   The Vest Indian Colonies attach great importance to this service and it is desired to give the Pacific Cable Board power to continue the samo facilities^ February  7th 19240                             - 3 -
