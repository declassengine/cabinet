REPORT.     THE SELECT COMMITTEE  appointed to consider what the REMUNERATION OF MINISTERS                    should be: HAVE agreed to the following REPORT :     1. Your Committee first  heard the evidence of Sir Warren Fisher, K.C.B., the permanent secretary to  the Treasury.   He laid  before  them  a full  statement  and  explanation  of  the remuneration at present  paid  to Ministers by  the  Treasury, and, where required, he furnishedsupplementary statements from the Departments concerned.    2. Your Committee&apos;had also the advantage of hearing Mr. Asquith, whose long experience  and ready response to the questions put to him with regard to past changes and  the  present positionmade his evidence most valuable.    3.. Before your Committee finally approved  their Eeport  the  Chancellor  of the Exchequer, athis own request, gave evidence on the nature and historic importance of the. tie that links the officeof First  Lord of the  Treasury to that of the Prime Minister. Your Committee did  not feel that thisevidence conflicted with their recommendations, and they recognise that  the office of First Lord ofthe Treasury would  naturally be held by one of the leading Ministers, if not by the Prime minister himself.    4.  The  standards of work and pay upon which the  present  scale*&quot;*of remuneration has beeiibuilt up were very different from those obtaining to-day, whether temporary orpermanent, andanewfactor has certainly arisen in the adoption by the House of the principle of the payment of Members,a payment in which Ministers do not participate.  But whilst the terms of the order of Reference,finally adopted by the House, are wide.enough to cover an exhaustive review  of the situation, your committee do not feel that this is a suitable time to recommend, by a general increase in Ministers&apos;remuneration, a large addition to the total amount of money  allocated for the payment of Ministers.They have, therefore, chiefly confined themselves to considering  the  relative position as between one Minister and another, having regard to  their responsibilities or to the work of the office held.    5.  From the evidence laid before them, your Committee are of the opinion that official residences Appendix .in London are a negligible factor in a  Ministers remuneration.   They therefore  recommend that Qs. I9andno Minister should receive an allowance in respect of a house  which he does not occupy, nor, on theother hand, should he suffer a reduction of salary if he chooses to accept the offer of the officialresidence.    6.  Considering the increasing&apos; burdens and responsibilities which recent Prime  Ministers havehad to bear, your Committee are of the opinion that the remuneration of the office is inadequate andshould certainly exceed that of other Cabinet Ministers.   Indeed, it is very doubtful  whether  any    u.man called to that  high office during recent reigns could  have sustained  the  position  without  *;  d&apos;private means.   Ttiey therefore recommend that the salary of the Prime Minister, as such, be fixed at  8,000 per  annum,  whether or not he holds the office of First Lord of the Treasury, the remuneration of which should  be abolished.    1. Your Committee have also agreed to the following recommendations:          (a)  That all members of the  Cabinet, with  the  exception of the Prime Minister, should    receive the same total salary irrespective of the office held.         (b) That the difference  between the  salaries  attached  to what may &quot;be called first  and    second class Ministries, which appears to your Committee to be unjustifiably  wide, be reduced    as shewn in Schedule I.         (c) That the distinction in the salaries of the various Parliamentary and Undersecretaries,    except  in  certain  cases  of special responsibility, such  as the Financial and Parliamentary    Secretaries to the Treasury, should be abolished.    8. Hitherto when the Prime Minister has desired the services in the Cabinet of n colleaguefree from the burden of heavy departmental work he has appointed him  to one of four practicallysinecure offices, namely, to that of the First Lord  of the  Treasury, the Lord Privy Seal, the lord president of the Council or the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  More recently a minister without Portfolio has been created.  Your Committee recommend that the remuneration attaching to these  offices, but not the offices themselves/should  be abolished, and that instead  the  PrimeMinister should  be entitled to  bring up to Cabinet rate of remuneration any unpaid or less highly paid office-holder, so long as that particular Minister holds a seat in the Cabinet, and any sums Sohednle n,so allocated should be placed on  the Estimates under the head of the Cabinet.  The remuneration ,attaching to  the above&quot; sinecure  offices now amounts to  19,000 per annum, but your Committees.estimate is  based on the assumption that the Prime  Minister^ normal  lequirements  under  thisparagraph would not exceed  10,000 in any one year.    0.211.                                           I                              A 2
               9.   Your Committee recommend the following classification  of  offices into which, with the           exception of the Prime Minister and the Law Officers, they are of opinion that all Ministers can b&quot;           suitably divided:                     1st class at  5,000 per annum.                    2nd class at  3,000 per annum.                    3rd class at  2,000 per annum.                          ,                    4th class at  1,500 per annum.                    5th class at  1,000 per annum.                                                            i               10. Whilst it will be seen that the present offices naturally fall  into  the above classification           your Committee make a special recommendation that  the Secretary for Scotland and the President           of the Board of Education be raised to  First class rank.  In the former case a Lord Advocate on           being appointed Secretary for  Scotland, has had  to  sacrifice   3,000 of his salary, the superior           position being paid less than the lower.  The growing  responsibilities  attaching to the Head of the           Board of Education ought also to command the services ot a Minister  of the First rank.               11. With regard to  the Ministry of Transport, your Committee feel that, unless  unforeseen           developments occur in the futurt), the work of this Department  does not seem to  merit more than           Second class rank.               12. Your Committee are of the opinion that the Lord Chancellors salary from theConsolidate:l           Fund should not exceed that of a First-class Minister, namely  5,000 per annum.  His remuneration           as Speaker of the House  of Lords they  feel is outside their terms of reference.               13. Your Committee have not taken special evidence with  regard  to the  remuneration  of the           Law Officers, but  certain memoranda have been submitted to  them which shew that the system           varies in England, Scotland and Ireland, and has been subject to changes from time to time.  That           now in force shews that in England a  fixed salary  is  paid, and that certain fees for contentiousAppendix.   business are allowed.  In return the officers give a whole-time  service.  After consideration of the           figures set out in  Appendix No. Ill, your Committee recommend that the salaries of the Attorney-           General and the Solicitor-General, at present fixed at  7,000 and   6,000 per annum respectively,           be  each reduced  by  2,000 per  annum, on  the understanding  that their  fees for contentious           business should remain.   .               In Scotland and Ireland an inclusive sum is paid to cover all services and your Committee do           not recommend any alteration in the salary attached to the  offices of Lord Advocate, Solicitor-           General for Scotland, Attorney-General for Ireland  or  the Solicitor-General for Ireland.Schedule If      14. In making this  Report your Committee have had in mind the fact that the operativeTable A.  &apos;  result  of their recommendations-as  a whole  would  be  practically  to balance  any resulting           increaseiby the reduction or abolition of a number of salaries.
