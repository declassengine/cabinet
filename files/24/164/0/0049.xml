It is unquestionable that this Company has aninternational reputation, and is, in fact, one of the finest,, ifnot the finest Opera Company in the world.  It is obvious that a refusal tt allow the Company to oome might cause a certain amountof astonishment and disappointment, not only to music lovers inLondon and Britain generally, but also to muslo lovers throughoutthe world who know the traditions of the Viennese Opera and itshigh artistic value.  The whole of the Company&apos;8 orohestra, as wellas -  singerB, work together harmoniously as a -result of longtraining and, if one might use the term, play as a team.     On the other hand, Sir William MtOormiok informs me that theeffect of this visit would Tte literally to destroy the British OperaCompany,  He says that there is no other theatre in London availablefor them;  that they look upon the time of the Empire Exhibition asa time when they ean recoup themselves for losses alreadyexperienced;-  that the whole of the Oompany, including theorchestra, will be out of work during the 10 weeks the VienneseOompany desires tft  1 .stay;  and that there is great danger ofdisintegration if the Oompany again breaks into its constituent parts.     I personally know that there are differences of opinion in theCabinet as to what ought to be done, and my suggestion is that thedecision should be a Cabinet decision-in view of the many things that are to be considered, amongst them being, of course, foreignrelationships,  for a decision to turn down the request of the vienna Opera Company oould not fail to have a repercussion outside,Rt.Hon.J.Ramsay Maodohald, M.P.                         /what   10, Downing Strtot,
     What I propose to do, if it meets with yeurapproval and that of the Cabinet, is to try to get BaronFranokenstein, the Austrian Minister, Sir WilliamMoOormiok and, if necessary, a representative of theBritish Musioians round the table,  in order to get, ifpossible, a compromise agreement,  Th6 Cabinet might decide to appoint some of its members to be present atthat meeting and to give them power, after hearing the statements made, to oome to a decision,     I am sorry to trouble you with this matter, but under all the circumstances I think that Cabinetresponsibility is the better course in the matter.                       Yours very sincerely,                           (Sgd,) To SHAW,
