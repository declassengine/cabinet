Its&apos; main objectswill be (a) the continuance, subject possibly to some modification, of the temporary scheme for spreading the cost of outrelief throughout London, (b) the further extension of the periods prescribed by the Local Authorities (financial provisions) Act, 1921, in relation to the borrowing by localauthorities for purposes of or in connection with unemploymentrelief, and (c) the continuance, subject to amendment, of thetemporary provisions for out relief to able-bodied persons inScotland.         The Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions). Act oflast year continued the temporary provisions mentioned aboveuntil  the 1st of April; 1924, in the case of (a) and  (b), anduntil  the 15th of May, 1924, in the case of (c)0   It will beseen,  therefore, that it is imperative that the continuinglegislation of this Session should be passed at a very earlydate,                                              /     2* National Health.....Insurance. Bill.   This Bill,  whichwas  also referred to in the King!s Speech, is required in.6rdeto make provision for the cost of medical benefit,    It isdesirable that the Bill shoul.1 be passed as early as  possible.
                                        - v. 4 IB   !The findings of the Court of Inquiry have been received,and there is strictly no legal authority after the 1st ofJanuary this year for payments In excess of the  7s.,5d,provided for in the original Act.     3. Menta 1 Treatment.-: Bill.  This Bill passed the Houseof Lords last year and has now been revised.   It isproposed that It should be introduced in the House ofCommons this Session.     4&apos; Therapeutic Substances Bill.    This Bill provides.:for the regulation of the manufacture,  sale, and importation&apos;of vaccines, sera, and other therapeutic&apos;substances.        The Bill passed the House  of Lords  last  year,  andit is  desirable from a health  point of  view that it  ahouldbe passed  into law this Session.   It  is proposed that itshould again be introduced  In the  House of  Lords.      ^*  Hating and Valuation.Bill.   This Bill was  also mentioned  In the King&apos;s Speech&apos;.    It will not be practicable to settle  the  final  form  of the  Bill for some time,  as the observations and  criticisms of the Associations  of  localauthorities  and other  interests  concerned  to  whom  a  draftcf the Bill has been circulated  have not yet  all been  received,and when this  has  been done negotiations will almost certainly be necessary on various  aspects  of  the question before the Bill  can  be introduced.      6&apos; National  Health Insurance  (Consolidation)  Bill..This  Bill was  introduced  last  Session  in the  House  of  Lords, It is proposed that  it 3hould  again be  introduced  in the House of Lords,  and,  in accordance with the usual  custom, referred to the  Joint  Committee  on Consolidation Bills. This  Bill, like  the  three others mentioned below, makes no change in the  law but merely  consolidates  the existing
         statutes^    It is very -argently demanded by approved         societies  and all persons concerned; in; health insurance         administration.              7o Housing (Consolidation) Bill.   This Bill con-         solidates  into a single code the permanent provisions of         the Housing Actsj  it leaves untouched the temporary         provisions of the Acts now in force for encouraging the         building of houses.   Local authorities have for a long         time past  pressed for a Bill of this kind and It is very         desirable  that It should be passed, if possible this         year,.   It would also be introduced in the House of         Lords and referred to the Joint Committee on.Consolidation         Bills.              8. Town Planning-(Consolidation) Bill.   This ia a   ,         Bill to consolidate as a separate code those-Parts and         Sections of the Housing Acts of 1909, 1919.and 1923, which         relate to town planning.   The Bill is a necessary         consequence of the consolidation of the Housing Acts         proper, and it is proposed that it should be introduced         and dealt with in the same way.              9&apos;, Small Dwellings Acquisition .(Consolidation) Bill.         This Bill, which is also consequential on the two preceding         Bills, consolidates the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act,         1899, and the Section amending that Act in subsequent         housing legislation.   It is proposed that It should be         Introduced and dealt with in the same way as the other         three Bills.              10. Smoke Abatement Bill,-   This Bill was read a         second time in the Lords last year but made no further         progress.   It will probaoly be desirable to introduce         it  in. the Lords again this Session.                                  .  (Intld.)  J.W.Ministry  of Health,     5th  February, 1924,
