OPERATIONS. CORRECTION.In telegram No: 320 of 19th instant from General Delme&apos;-Radcliffe to 0*1.0*S?  please read in line 15, page 2, for &quot;(one group Undecipherable) plateau11   &quot;Bainsizza Plateau&quot;.K Circulated to War Cabinet on 20th August, 1917. (G.B. 1783)SECRET.-   /C471
E.the Fornaza Heights continuing south-west towards Comarie t runs close to the enemy Ts trenches as far as Flondar, from which point south the Flondar line has been taken by the 13th Corps.      Italian line now passes through point 110 to San Giovanni, which has been occupied.     Italians have lost heavily from artillery and machine-gun fire.     Out of 6 strong battalions Bersagliere Brigade of the 23rd Corps has only 17 officers and about 500 men left.     By 7 p.nu 3,700 prisoners and six 150-millimetre guns had been taken.     Prisoners state that Austrian losses are slight as they hold front line trenches very lightly, and, during Italian bombardment, keep their troops in deep dug-outs. On the whole progress of Second Army is satisfactory and promises to develop well, as the out-flanking and converg-ing movements towards the (one group undecipherable) Plateau has been well started and will be pressed with vigour.     Progress of Third Army is a little disappoint-ing and better results had been hoped for and after good beginning of the infantry advance this morning.A feature of the operations has been diversion of half the body of the Isonzo into the latisone River by means of four dams in neighbourhood Caporetto, which have taken about 4 months to construct.     The Infantry of the Second Army was enabled by the diminution   of the water in the Isonzo to wade across at several places.     A heavy bombardment is proceeding on the Carso to-night and another attack will be made to-morrow, chiefly with fresh troops.
