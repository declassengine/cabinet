SECRET.WAR   CABINET. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE BILL.Notes on Sir Edwin Cornwallls Memorandum - CT.1594 -and Mr. Hayes Fisher&apos;s Memorandum - G0T9 1662*(1)   The following notes should be read together with mynotes (G.T.1268) on Lord Rhondda^ Memorandum (G.T.1056), and I have little to add to the views which I there expressed.     I quite agree with Mr0 Hayes Fisher that it is impossible to suppose that Parliament would assent to a Bill of the kind suggested by Sir Edwin Cornwall.(2)   The Draft Bill which Sir Edwin Cornwall has circulated involves the following important changes, any one of which would in existing circumstances, in my opinion, be strongly opposed in Parliament(a)   it requires the sanction of at least three Central Departments namely the Local Government Board for England and Wales, the Insurance Commission for England, and the Insurance Commission for Wales, to action contemplated by an authority under the Bill. I am inclined to think that one should add a fourth Central Department, namely, the Board of Education, who would certainly havo to be consulted in numerous instancec.(b)
(b) Clause 1 (2) of the Bill proposes to create new areas for health purposes by excluding the smaller Urban District Councils and the Rural District Councils from operating independently under the Bill.(c) Clauce 2 of the Bill imposes upon. CountyCouncils, County Borough, Urban District, and BoroughhealthCouncils an obligation to add to their/authority under the Bill a considerable proportion of members of Insurance Committees.     It must be borne in mind that these Committees are not elected bodies responsible in any real sense to their constituents, but are nominated, not by the insured persons themselves, but by the Committee of Management of Approved Societies, who obtain repre-sentation on the Insurance Committees in proportion to the number of insured persons who are members of particu-lai? Societies.Moreover none of the services in connection with maternity or child welfare are any part of the present duties of Insurance Committees.     None of the proposals now made for developing the medical services under the National Insurance Acts emanated either from Insurance Committees or Approved Societies.     They were   in fact formulated and worked out by myself for the considera-tion of the Prime Minister when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer before the outbreak of the war.(d) The Bill involves the abandonment in regard to provision for maternity and child welfare of the princi-ple of Grants in Aid, which has always been used hithertoto
to stimulate local effort and to bring home to the areas concerned their responsibility for the state of public health in the area, . .I gather from Clause 3 of the Bill that no obligation whatever would be thrown upon the rate-payers unless and until they decided to make provl-sion in excess of that which the Central Departments concerned considered adequate.As I pointed out in my previous memorandum, I do not doubt that a thorough examination of the position of the Local Authorities which exercise powers in regard to public healthy and of the division of responsibility between the various Authorities, is urgently required, but I do not see how        Parliament can be expected to assent to sweeping changes which are proposed; not after consultation with the Local Authorities concerned, since the Minister responsible for Health Insurance has no jurisdiction over these authorities, but simply to conciliate a rival set of authorities who object to any extension of public health work which does not provide the safeguards considered by them to be necessary in their own interests0The position, therefore, is that the Approved Societies, whose policy is governed in the main by representatives of the Industrial Assusance Companies, will prevent the passage of any measure on the lines proposed by the Local Government Board, while the Local Government Board cannot accept the mimimum proposals required to secure theacquiescence
acquiescence of the Health Insurance bodies.I am driven to conclude that both the Local Goveflrn-ment Board and Sir Edwin Cornwall are in error in supposing that any minor measure affecting public health can be carried through Parliament until the Ministry of Health proposed by Lord Rhondda has been established.   I do not believe that any other authority can open negotia-tions with the numerous and po7/erful interests concerned with any prospect of reconciling their differences. The existing Departments are necessarily regarded as upholders of the views of a particular section, whether Local Authorities or Approved Societies, and I believe that the establishment of a Ministry of Health which can go into these questions without being accused of partisanship is long overdue and is most urgently&apos; required.When the question of authorising the introduction of a Eill to establish a Ministry of Health was discussed by the War Cabinet in June last, I understood that the opposition anticipated from those who control the Approved Societies was the sole reason which led to the postponement of the War Cabinet!s decision,       I have had an opportunity of reading the document on which Sir Edwin Cornwall&apos;s present proposals are based, and I notice that those whom he consulted, (and among them were representatives of the Societies connected with Industrial Assurance Companies as well as of otherApproved
Approved Societies) said that &quot;the proposals stop short of what they all desire to see attained as soon as possible, viz. the establishment, on suitable lines, of a new Central Department unifying various elements in a Ministry of Health.&quot;This statement lends additional support to the proposal that the War Cabinet should sanction the establishment of a Ministry of Health, and until this has been done should not approve the introduction of any partial measures, which are, I believe, from the outset doomed to failure, and would involve much controversy and endless departmental friction.(6)    The War Cabinet will not have failed to observe that, since the establishment of the Ministry was last dis-cussed by them, popular feeling on the subject has become very much stronger.     There have been the demon-strations in favour of a Ministry of Health which arose in connection with Baby Week; the public pronouncement by Lord Rhondda to the effect that he regards the C-overn-ment as pledged to establish it; and the letter in the &quot;Times&quot; from Mr. Benjamin Broadbent threatening further agitation in the event of continued delay.     I believe that the establishment of a Ministry of Health could bring the Government nothing but credit, and I do not think that any alternative measure, even if it were possible to secure its passage through Parliament, wouldtake
take us any nearer to the solution of the most urgent problems with which it will be the duty of the first Minister of Health to deal.C. ADDISON.13th August, 1917a
