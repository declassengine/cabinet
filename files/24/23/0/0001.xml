GOYEKLvIEiNT.L -gote by the Secretary.At the Lieeting of the War Cabinet; held on^August End, 1917, (YJar Cabinet  03, Hinute 5), the First .jea Lord stated that it migirt ^possible but not easy, for the lavy to spare some senior officers to assist the re-organization of the Russian IJavy.The War Cabinet will remember that, at the recent Conference with the French and Italian Governments, the same question was raised, when ii. Albert Thomas pressed that the ^British Government might give assistance to Russia in this respect.fI have now received an intimation from the Admiralty that the First Lord has been considering the question; that there is likely to be some difficulty in providing an officer of high rank and an adequate 3taff; and as the Admiralty are very uncertain as to what would be the best form for such assistance to take, the First Lord thinks it would be best to wait until Sear-Admiral Victor A. Stanley reaches Petrograd and is able to confer with the Russian Government as to whether Haval assistance would be acceptable and what would be tbe best form for it to takevAdmiral Stanley is leaving England shortly and will be asked to report on the matter as soon as possible after his arrival.(Intd. ) M.P.A.H.Z Whitehall Gardens. o.i., 13th August 1917,
