Jo f?    /SECRET.WAR   CABINET.G T. 1756.THE PETROLEUIi POSITION.fcEE-jORANHj^ BY Mr. &apos;Walter Long with a Covering Note.I think the Cabinet may be interested to   have a brief summary of the Petroleum position:   the control of which they entrusted to me on the 22nd of l:ay. . (War Cabinet No. 142, Minute 10.)The task of evolving order out of chaos and of increasing the supplies has been an extremely anxious and difficult one and I am deeply indebted to Professor Cadman my Liaison Officer for invaluable assistance.   The Shipping Controller has gj ren unfailing help, and his representative lir. Keraball Cook has handled a very difficult situation with splendid courage and ability.I am greatly indebted to all the Departments for their ready and cordial acceptance of the new conditions and for their loyal co-operation,e The Fourth Sea Lord, Admiral Tothill,. Sir Walter Sgerton, Chairman&quot;of Committee&apos;responsible for Imported products, and Sir E. Jones, the Petrol Committee, have given me most loyal and able assistance.The Board of Trade and Ministry of Munitions have placed their resources and help unreservedly at my disposal and though it is not possible that the position can be regarded as satis:&apos; -factory for some months to come,  I am able to state that all is going smoothly,  all the friction has disappeared and I believe everything possible is being done here and in the United States of America to secure -success.   For the present the greatest economy at home is essential.The present position is somewhat improved as compared with that of months ago, although it is still causing grave anxiety.I have adopted a policy of maintaining a stock of at least two months supply for all the Departments.    It is, of course, by no means sufficient for real National safety.   The Admiralty stocks are&apos; always given priority.The total stocks of all Petroleum produots for the Admiralty War Office and Civil requirements should not be less than 1.500;000 tons per month.   The present consumption amounts to just under 500,000 tons .per month.   These figures, however, will rapidly increase with the greater demands of the Admiralty for fuel as new ships come into commission.   The present total stockB amount to just under 1,000,000 tons or roughly two months supply. There are special cases such as Home consumption of Petrol and Kerosene in which the stocks are not so good.   Por instance, there is only one month&apos;s supply of Kerosene in the country and six weeks&apos; supply of Petrol.   Steps are being taken, however, to increase the stocks   of these products.   Kerosene is greatly used by the wage earning classes for cooking and heating. .(Intd.) W.H.L.16th. August, 1917.MEMORANDUM ON THE PETROLEUM POSITION.
