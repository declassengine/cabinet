The general position has taken a slight turn for the worse during the last week.   The most active unrest is still to &quot;be found among the miners..-  A number of strikes of some importance are in proTress, though none of them are of national significance.A four days strike of the workers at the Lewis Merthyr colliery began on the 9th.   The cause of it is an excellent commentary on that section of the report of the Industrial Coimiissioners for South Wales which dealt with the lack of a human and conciliatory spirit among&apos; employers and workers,   in assistant timberman employed in the oollisry was killed.   Following the usual custom the miners ceased work for the morning- as a token of respect,   IThen the men reported for the afternoon shift the Management annoyed at their conduct, and alleging that only the night shift, to which the dead man had belonged should have ceased work, locked them out.   All the men in the colliery then declared a one day strike and as an act of retaliation the Management decided to continue the lock out over the week-end.   There has also been a strike involving 1,200 men at the Croesfaen Colliery, Treharris, owing to a dispute about a ;.ar Bonus.In Yorkshire a series of strikes involving about 15,000 men and beginning at the Hew Silkstone and Haiffh Moor Collieries on the 8th have talien place.   The miners are aggrieved at the present method of recruiting for the army,   A meeting was held at Castleford at which the men resolved that they were prepared to go back to work provided that all men who have entered the mines since August 1914 are immediately combed out.   The officials of the Yorkshire Miners Association are doing their best to calm the men, but it is feared that the trouble may spread. An important strike also commenced on Monday among the iron ore miners in Cumberland, some 9,000 men being involved (see Part III)The men who struck work at the Crown Tube Works. We&amp;nesbury. for the dismissal of a manager who had been insolent to a discharged soldier seeking reinstatement are still out.   The Ministry of Munitions have promised an investigation providing the men will first return to work, but the officials of the Workers1 Union are quite unable to persuade them to do so.   It appears that the manager in cuestion has for some time been unpopular.Reference was recently made to dissatisfaction existing among the dockers at Hull owing to an award of the Committee on Production.   A report has now been received that some 200 of them have ceased work.All the electrical workers employed by firms in Cardiff struck work on the 2nd in consequence of a difference of opinion cts to the proper inter-rotation of
an award of the Committee on Production.   The men were persuaded to return to work and a joint reference of &quot;the dispute has &quot;been sent to the Chief Industrial Commissioner.SJJCTION II. DISPUTES.Owing to the prolongation of the holidays the week has been marked hy a very.considerable diminution in the number of disputes which have been reported.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 65 cases almost all of which are from the Clyde or the Newcastle area, only six of which resulted in a stop-age of work, and twenty one of which have been successfully settled, in most cases by officers of the Department.   The most interesting disputes described are from Liverpool; the first owing to the employment of non-unioniBt Canadian Boilermakers who have now been discharged, and the second to the refusal of Messrs. Abdela h Mitchell of Queensferry to accept an award: the firm in this case are apparently following the disastrous example which has too often been set by the men.   A delegation of boilermakerB ??as received at the Ministry of Labour /bh Thursday last in regard to the threatened stoppage of &quot;Boilermakers at the Eartlepools over the question of standardised ships.   Certain proposals were made to the delegates, which have been accepted by the men and the matter appears to be in the way of settlement.The Ministry of Munitions report twelve cases of dispute as having arisen during the week, four of which have since been settled.   Of these latter one was due to the attempt of a new foreman in an aeroplane metal factory to speed-up the production, and the other to tho action of an apprentice in his fourth year who refused to perform work which he regarded as unskilled.   Two disputes are reported from Motor works.   One of thSJBS has been proceeding for some time and is due to the fact that Messrs. Crossley Motors Ltd* who have started a fluctuating bonus which is very popular have not extended it to the labourers in the tool room.   The other is at the Leyland Motors Ltd. Preston.   This firm is alleged to have employed women on skilled machines, but at ordinary rates.   There is little likelihood of a strike however as the men affected who are few in number are afraid of the possible action of their patriotic neighboursThe War Office Contracts Department has only two new cases of dispute to report, nine old cases are however referred to.   A strike of hosiery workers at Dumfries is feared unless wages are increased, while the National Leather Trades1 Federation has issued a notice to the employers requiring them to pay an advance of 50^ on existing rates of day work on Government contracts for certain leather work. . The object of this is thought to be the abolition of day work rates as opposed to piece work rates, which are ouch more remunerative. In the Jute trade the spinners and weavers have applied for an increase of 5/&apos;- a week to all employees.In the Woollen trade the Central Advisory Committee has recommended that the maximum hours be Increased to 50.   Should this recommendation be adopted it may lead to a considerable relaxation of the tension which has
been noted in Yorkshire and other woollen districts.iihe movement for an eight hour clay&apos;among a section of the locomotive drivers- is becoming more prominent. Resolutions in its favour have been passed in many parts of the country.   The last and most important of these, in that it included the threat oi an immediate strike, is reported irojn a meeting of drivers and stokers on the Go:eat   extern Railway held at Tondu in Sales on the 14th. The national Union of Railwayman have refused to take part in the movement-       have earned their members that it is their duty to obey the Executive and remain at work, i&apos;he position was fully stated by Sir Albert Stanley in the House of Commons on the 15th instant.A uovement for an eight hour day is also reported to be causing anxiety in the Yorkshire coal fields where the surface i:or--.ers are threatening to hand in their notices.   Should a strike occur  0,000 \*or?iers vrill be affected..The Committee on Production have during the past week heard eighteen oases, three of them in Scotland and the remainder in London.   The most important of these was an application by the National Union of Dock Labourers snr&quot;! Riverside Workers to the Enroloyers Association of the Port of Liverpool for an advance of wages and alteration in r; or king conditions.
III. DISTRICT REPORTS.mk North 1st Coast,The position on the Clyde :j.s still fairly quiet. There is a small strike of rivetters owing to a question arising out of the building of standard ships% and there has also been trouble at Parkhead in connection with the calling up of several hundred men for military service.The agitation against the present basis of the income tax, which is now equal to a pre-war assessment of about  75, has spread to the Clyde and,resolutions have been passed advocating a refusal to pay the tax if there is any increase either in the rate of the tax itself or in the price of food.The proposed conference of Soldiers1 and Workers&apos; Delegates which was to have been -held on Saturday last was prohibited by the authorities.   A demonstration of protest attended by some 2000 people was however held, at which it was stated that the conference would certainly be held at a later date.Peeling in Scotland on the subject of attending   the Stockholm conference is divided.   The Glasgow Labour Party which represents chiefly the engineers instructed its delegates to vote in favour of accepting the Scandinavian Committee&apos;s invitation.   The miners on the other hand and possibly the textile workers, are much opposed to such a policy.The position in this district is satisfactory, although the introduction   of pneumatic rivetting tools into various shipyards seems to have caused some discontent among the Boilermakers.   The latter are also still very restless about the delay which has taken place in connection with the question of standardised ships.   The Ministry of Labour&quot; is dealing with the matter.Opinion at Newcastle is on the whole decidedly opposed to the policy of the Stockholm Conference.Conditions at Barrow are still quiet after the holidays. The Joint Trades Committee has agreed to support a national protest against the recent 3/- Engineering Award even to the length of handing in a weekTs notice.In Cumberland the marked unrest among the iron-ore miners, under present conditions one of the most important bodies of workers in the country, continues.   Proposals made by the Ministry of Munitions were regarded as distinctly unsatisfactory and as a result the men refused them and did not return to work on Monday las.t.   The strike involves .9,000 men, but it is hoped that it will be of short duration, as a representative of the Chief Industrial Commissioner is to meet the men today (Wednesday).jfeoashire The conditions in this area are fairly normal exceptI Cheshire.for continued unrest among the boilermakers at Liverpool.The men have apparently been under the impression that an award supplementary to that on standard ships and in regard to the merging of their 4/- rise in wages in the subsequent Iff 5/- award was to be issued on the 11th instant and areholding a meeting tonight (August 5th) to discuss the matter. The Ministry of Labour has however informed them that the award cannot be re-opened.At Stockport a meeting of Workers and Soldiers Delegates was held on Saturday and the proceedings were somewhat riotous,   A resolution in support of the-Russian Revolution and advocating a similar one for this country ?/as hoy/ever passed.In regard to Stockholm and the proceedings of last week/ thefrrrow and interland.
the tendency seems to have been to follow Mr. Henderson rs judgment in the matter.   Subsequent events have caused the men to I to withhold their judgment in acticipation of Mr. Henderson&apos;sstatement in the House of Commons.The approaching conference of Shop Stewards has caused little interest,kshire. Owing to the extended holidays the position is quiet.    It-    is n0^. ye^- possible to give a definite estimate of opinion with regard to Stockholm, but the miners and garment workers are strongly opposed to it.It is characteristic of the better side of the Shop Stewards movement that they have decided that the dismissal of Riley, the elleged sufferer from victimisation, is justified owing to his immoral conduct.Unrest among the miners is referred to in Section I..he Midlands.       Conditions in this area&apos; are on the whole quiet, though at Nottingham there are signs of unrest, among the engineers.   The 3/- award is still very obviously rankling, while there has been a recrudescence of suspicion about female and unskilled labour,At Nottingham opinion is definitely hostile to Stockholm but at Birmingham it is more evenly divided.   In the latter city anxiety as to the employment of Chinese labour in the heavy iron trade is said to be increasing.lOndon. The industrial situation is qaiet, /The various peace societies signalised the meeting of the Labour. Party Conference by a week of activity.An important meeting of the Amalgamation Committee for the Engineering, Metal and Shipbuilding Trades which was attended by delegates from various centres took place on August 5th and apparently, decided to dissolve itself and to form a new industrial union as part of the Independent Workers of the World,   W.1P, Watson, who is not as yet a member of the latter Society but has been the life of the Amalgamation movement, has resigned his position as Secretary.ioutn The position in South &quot;/ales is unsettled owing to marked[dies. unrest among the miners which shows no sign of abatement.Opinion in regard to Stockholm is generally favourable to representation though several branch meetings of the Labourers1 Union have been held at which the action of the Seamenrs and Firemen^ Union has received strong support and demands made for the removal of those officers of the Society who supported Mr, Henderson on Friday last.
I- HffiSS OPIUMS,The chief subject of comment in the labour Press t..iu of last weel: no less than in the Press as_a whole hasSr%^ocEholm   been the labour Party Conference held on iPriilay last, Terence^      and the question of the Stockholm Conference which was ^ raised thereby,     It is at present only possible todeal with opinions which were expressed in regard to the desirability of the Labour Party sending represen-tatives to Stockholm as no commentary on the actual proceedings has yet been received.A strong view against going to Stockholm is expressed, in the &quot;British Citizen and Empire 7orker.&quot; &amp; which not only attacks Hr. Henderson but the Primeilinister and the Government as a whole for not pursuing a more definite and vigorous policy:-      &quot;It &quot;is idle to ignore the fact that the Government of Mr, &quot;Lloyd George is steadily losing the confidence of the&quot;nation.........* Ho deadlier blow has been dealt at&quot;the solidarity of the ?iation since the outbreak of the&apos;%rf&apos;........ The Government is doing badly, and by&quot;none has it been served worse than by Mr, Arthur &quot;Henderson,&quot;    This point of view is strongly supported by &quot;Justice&quot; in a somewhat better reasoned, article ending;- &quot;This is no time for big conferences and&quot;Stockholm fiascos.     It would be a gross betrayal of &quot;Liebimecht for us to meet the Gorman &quot;Majoritaires&quot;. &quot;It would mean treachery to our men in the field and on &quot;the seas to allow them to be misrepresented by a host &quot;of conscientious objectors&quot;.The &quot;Clarion&quot; makes up the triumvirate of what may be termed the patriotic socialist press.     Its article is headed &quot;Stop at Home&quot; and ends with the query:-      &quot;Does Labour in this country noan to attend - &quot;a Conference whose &quot;good&quot; results would be another &quot;Armageddon?     To-day they will decide.     Let us hope &quot;that common sense will prevail.&quot;The attitude expressed in these papers is that of the Daily papers as a rchole both in London and in the -Provinces.The &quot;Hew Statesman&quot; which has some claim to represent the intelligenzia of the Labour movement says that whatever happens will be &quot;a triumph for Mr. Henderson&quot;.      It expresses no opinion either for or against his proposal but doubts very much whether the Conference vd.ll actually assemble.The &quot;Hation&quot; \7liose bitter jibes usually find a resting place in the extremist labour organs thinks that if the labour Party &quot;should elect to go, its &quot;decision will be at once the salvation of the Alliance, &quot;and a rude check to the party whose policy would &quot;destroy it.&quot;       This attitude is strongly supported in the &quot;Call&quot; which thinks that &quot;the Labour movement &quot;of Great Britain holds the peace of the world in its &quot;hand.     On its decision rests the aotion of the s&quot;Socialist majorities in Germany and Prance&quot;.The &quot;Herald&quot; is argumentative;-      &quot;The Stock-&quot;holm Conference is being held not in order that a &quot;section of each country may make a patched-up peace, &quot;but in order to find out first how the present&quot; war &quot;can be ended, and. secondly how Labour can secure that &quot;such a catastrophe may never happen again.&quot;      Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; is less bitter       &apos; than usual and says;-       &quot;Hr. Renders-en&apos;s action isnot/
&quot;not only sensible, but the only thing he could have done in &quot;the circumstances.&quot;The local Labour papers which are all more or less dominated by the Independent Labour Party express fairly moderate views in favour of going to Stockholm.The &quot;Leicester Pioneer&quot; points out that &quot;this is not a matter in which all the pre-war men are on one side with the Pacifists on the other&quot;, while the &quot;Glasgow Forward&quot; hopes &quot;that the conference will materialise successfully&quot; as it will result in a clearing of the air.Finally Mr. Ramsay Hacaonald after arguing in the &quot;Leicester Pioneer&quot; that the Capitalist class fear the Stookholm Conference lest it should bring about a Resolution in Germany, proceeds in the &quot;Forward&quot; to make vague threats against the Government if, as he fears, they refuse passports to the delegates.ftrkers and. These Councils which are of course closely connected with:s      the Stockholm movement are the subject of less oomment this week.The&quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; thinks that &quot;they have now beoome &quot;the &apos;&apos;storm centre of the movement for a peOple^ peace&quot; while the &quot;Kerald&quot; draws attention to the fact that &quot;the more active &quot;portion of the Labour movement in Scotland is at present concentrated &quot;on their work&quot;.   Generally speaking, however, the Counoils are attracting little attention and show little sign of becoming important.adust rial .The reports of the Industrial Commissioners continue toomaissions attract attention.   The &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; demands that the Government should emulate &quot;their commendable zeal and speed&quot; by at once putting their recommendations into operation.The &quot;Herald&quot; is condemnatory, accusing the Commissioners of omitting to deal with various important matters such as the working of the Munitions Tribunals and also of a degree of hypocrisy, in that although they must have been well aware &quot;that our whole industrial system is obsolete and past repair, not a hint of this fact &quot;appears in any of the reports&apos;1&apos;,The &quot;Labour Leader^ finds fault with Hr. Btirnes for &quot;bowdlerising &quot;and giving an incorrect version of the reports, which it thinks, though not original, are better than might have been expected.Several Trade Journals have been received and none of them are very enthusiastic.   The &quot;Iron and Coal trades Fteview&quot; &quot;harps on the prominence given to the distrust of the Government, y/hile the &quot;Colliery Guardian&quot; raises a number of more or less weighty objections to putting the recommenda-tions of the ComrrLs si oners into practice.Abundance of cheap vegetables no doubt largely due to the encouragement of allotment gardening has temporarily put a stop to the food agitation and there is but littlo comment,now&quot;Justice&quot; is sarcastic:- &quot;Lord Rhondda is^making a move, VRo is making a move to make a move in September towards faking the move in December.. Marvellous!&quot;FoodThe. &quot;Clarion&quot; is pessimistic &quot;having not much hope of &quot;bhe great results accruing to the people by the control of &apos;bne item of food&quot; (bread) -Virile the &quot;British Citizen&quot; has a powerful article on &quot;Lord Rhondda&apos;s Cheapened loaf policy&quot;
and -bounty system.The forthcoming conference of Shop Stewards at Hanchester has not attracted much notioe* The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; thinks that &quot;it may have an exceedingly important &quot;influence on the future of British Trade Unionism&quot;, while the &quot;Hew Age&quot; characterises the movement as essentially &quot;defensive&quot; and due to the &quot;universal distrust&quot; of Trade Union officials and the Government policy.   The &quot;Herald&quot; is still appealing for funds to pay the legal expenses of the men arrested in connection with the strike, and there are other indications that the movement is in difficulties for funds.The &quot;Herald&quot;, &quot;Labour Leader&quot;, and &quot;Forward&quot; contain highly enthusiastic descriptions of meetings which have been held by these organisations, the activities of, which are becoming prominent.Recent events in Russia seem rather to have damped ion   enthusiasm for the Revolution in this country.The &quot;Leicester Pioneer&quot; however says that &quot;If the ^Russian Revolution has thrown back the Allies in the &quot;military sense it has had the compensation of clearing the &quot;political issues they represent and in forcing a little more &quot;of moral idealism into their war aims0&quot;Tj? The conversion of the 17ar Bonus which had been given tothe railwaymen into a permanent wage increase is greeted with a good deal of enthusiasm by the mom strictly labour papers.The &quot;Herald&quot;-says that the action of the Rail?/ay Executive is &quot;interesting because everybody knows that the cost of living will not go dovm when the war ends but there is reason to believe, that there will be attempts to depress wages&quot;.   It also calls upon every Union &quot;to insist that &quot;increases shall be reckoned as permanent wages and not as &quot;a?ar bonus.&quot;I
V.   SMBRAL REMARKS.The Commissioners on Industrial Unrest gave a prominent position to the administration of the Military Service Acts, to which attention has on occa-sion been drawn in these reports, as a cause of discon-tent.     They were, however, of the opinion that the evident irritation was due to the administration of the Acts and not to the Acts themselves,     -/iiile generally speaking this is no doubt true there is a body of evidence, more particularly in regard to certain industries, which suggests not only that the generalisa-tion is too sweeping, but that labour opinion in that connection is perhaps changing.First of all there can be no d.oubt that much of the suspicion which led. to the refusal of the &quot;Dilution Bill&quot; was due to a lively fear that that measure was intended as a means to further recruitment from the ranks of the skilled engineers.    This view was expressed at the time of the strike with an openness which suggests that it is held by no inconsiderable body among the engineers.    At the present moment it is reported that a serious position has arisen among the men on the Clyde owing to the calling up of some two hundred engineers and the unlawful arrest of several exempted men, and that an important strike may be the result.Much more serious however is the position in the coalmining industry;   where the Executive of the Miners1 Federation has recently undertaken to obtain  1,000 recruits for the army from among the members of the Union.     Owing to tho difficulty experienced in carrying it out, the scheme has now been suspended for a month, and some adjustments have been made to meet objections raised, but it is impossible to say what the result will be, when a further attempt is made to enforce it. In the meanwhile o-nly men who entered the mines since the war are being taken, and there are not many of these left.In the most important of all the coal fields that of South Tales opinion is undoubtedly hostile to any further oombing out.    A joint meeting of the Merthyr and Dowlais miners held on July 29th passed a resolu-tion &quot;rejecting the proposed comb-out until such time as the members were given an opportunity of expressing their opinion by ballot&quot;.    Local meetings have been held at Rhymney, Arrail, Griffin, Blaina, Treoynon, Haymney, Cambrian Colliery, oiydach Vale and Tylerstown. Finally at a speoial conference of the South /ales Miners Federation held at Cardiff on August 2nd the delegates rejected the scheme by 236 votes to 25 and resolved to take a ballot upon the procedure to be adopted to give effect to the resolution.In Lanarkshire thero appears to exist a similar if les3 widespread feeling.    At a meeting of protest . against profiteering the mass meeting claiming to represent the South Lanark miners &quot;pledged itself to a down tools policy to resist any attempt of the Govera-ment to take a single man for military service&quot;.In Yorkshire strikes involving about 15,000 men took place last week owing to the proposed comb out. The men demanded that all men who have entered the mines since the beginning of the war should go first, and threatened a complete stoppage if any of the others aretaken/
taken.The Leicester miners have also entered an objection to the recruiting scheme..At a meeting of Yorkshire Textile Workers representing 120,000 members a resolution against taking any men from the industry into the army was passed and the local societies were instructed to take the opinions of their members as to handing in seven days notice unless that resolution were agreed to by the Certified Occupations Co:iaitteQ.    A local Labour paper of moderate tone congratulates the officials on the excellent work they have done in securing exemption for their members.There is Qoue evidence that a similar feeling also exists among the railwaymen.    At the Annual general meeting of the IT.I5.R. a statement was made on behalf of the executive to the effect that the number of men released had reaohed the highest possible limits. A strong resolution was passed at a uass meeting of railwaymen held at Hull during the last month, against the release cf further men for military service, and decided that if auy more were released a further mass meeting should be called immediately to decide on the aotion which ought to be taken.A similar decision was tolam at a recent meeting of railwayman at Port Talbot.Strongly wordeft letters against the asHinc up of further workers wfciah have been given a prominent position in reoent numbers of the Journal of the Amalgamated Society of Cari*nter3 and Joiners suggest that there is socie body of opinion on the subject among the members of that Union.A significant episode al30 took place at a recent meeting of the Electrical Tra&amp;e3 Union, which was referred to in this Report for the week ending July 25th.    At this meeting, which was called to die-cuss the question of overtime, the London District Secretary stated that he had done his best to save men from the army, but there were now a number of members unemployed who would be called up by the. Military authorities unleoe work were fouad for them, whioh could only be done by prohibiting overtime work.    Al-though a motion to this effect was eventually negatived, it received very considerable support from speakers.There can be little doubt that much of the early enthusiasm for military service has evaporated and that there is some feeling- that the ideals which were in men1s hearts in the first months of the war have been forgotten by the governing classes.     There is a need for reassuring the country that the ideals of 1914 are still the ideals we are pursuing.     It is also no doubt the case that the voluntary system having exhausted most of those who were keen to fight, the later drafts under conscription consist mainly of men averse to doing 30.     The chief cause of this aversion, however, is probably the feeling that a man forfeits too much of his citizenship on becoming a soldier, that he is not treated with human sympathy and consideration by the military eAithorities.     It is- felt that the old military system is not suited to the needs of a oitizen amy, and that regulations which were framed for the professional soldier are unnecessarily irksome and oppressive as applied.&apos; to men of the ITe-w Armies.   There is also a belief that in dealing with offences no account is taken of the particular circumstances of each
case.     This feeling is strongly expressed in the &quot;Clarion1&apos; of August&quot;10th by Robert Blatchford, who whatever his defects has some experience of the old army and of the new.     &quot;The chief cause of the. impending row about the Army&quot;, he says, &quot;is the failure of the Government and the military authorities to recognise or understand the difference betvreen a professional sol-dier and a volunteer.     A volunteer goes into the armyto defend his country and not to get a living.&quot;.......&quot;Professional soldiers are used to abuses which strike a civilian as senseless outrages.     There is no public opinion in the professional army;    there is no trade union, no right of free speech or public meeting.   There is no standard of discipline other than the standard set up by the.military authorities.     That kind, of thingwill not do for an army of civilians.&quot;............&quot;Though numerous cases (of &quot;brutal severity&quot;) have not been made public they have not been forgotten.   Parents, wives,:friends of the volunteer soldier in England and the Colonies remember, and so do the civilians under arms, : The feeling is very widespread and intensely bitter*     That is why I say that after the war there will be trouble about the Arm,/.&quot;After making every allowance for exaggeration, there can be no ruestion that the feeling which finds expression in this article is very widely prevalent though it is vague and ill-defined.     There is some evidence that the extremists are obtaining converts among discharged soldiers, which if true is a proof of its existence.     Moreover, it not only makes the task of recruiting more difficult at the moment, but it will permanently affect the attitude of t?ac civil population to the Army after the war, and will make the question of military service one of extreme difficulty, should it be found necessary to maintain a larger Army than in pre-war days.The whole question is one which deserves the very serious consideration of the V/ar Office.D. J.S.16th August, 1917,
