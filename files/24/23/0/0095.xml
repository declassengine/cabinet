12599General Barter, Russia.OPERATIONS.19th August, 1917.SECRET.To:-C.I.G.S.,War Office.Handed in 1.20 a.m.No. 1195. August 18th.Last night Commander-in-Chief returned from Petrograd. He tells me he had only short interviews with Kerenski and . Minister of War which were satisfactory, latter especially strong-ly supporting him.considers it advisable to take Ministry generally into their confidence yet as regards all Commander-in-Chief&apos;s conditions probably because Kerenski fears Ministers representing to Petrograd Committees.   However, Kornilof said that conditionsMoscow on August 12th (sic) when the Government would be clear of Petrograd.   He said also that he was already putting some of his discipline measures into operation without reference to Government,at Moscow Congress. If he goes I propose to go too. Congress will last 3 days.as showing in polite way that British Government approve of Kornilof&apos;s policy if before the Congress he was given a high British decoration and that British Ambassador at Petrograd were to be immediately informed for notification   to Russian Government.hot been invited to the Conference on Salonika held in London. He seemed to think other Allied representative had taken part but could not give me any positive information except that Russian Ambassador had been invited late in the day.    In very friendlyApparently neither Commander-in-Chief nor Kerenskiwould be disclosed just before the Congress which will openKornilof does not know yet whether he will be presentI venture to suggest that it might have useful effect. Kornilof represented to me that General Desssino had
but firm way Kornilof   intimated that he thought slight had been inflicted on Russian tony and he asked me to find reasons. He said he would recall Dessino immediately if it was due to his personal shortcomings.I assured him no slight could have been possibly intended and explanations I should receive would prove quite satisfactory.   Evidently Kornilof   did not attach so much importance to absence of co-operation in Salonika direction as did Alexeieff but he thought it was very desirable to have active assistance there in its relation to South Western and Roumanian fronts.     I gave him same reasons I had given Alexeieff.Kornilof   was very anxious to know if, as seems to be indicated in Press telegrams, the British were beginning another offensive in France.   I was obliged to express my regret that I had no information on subject.
