T347dNATIONAL SHRVIOS DBPARTICffiT AND RECRUITING. 0 I -desire to refer to two memoranda which havebeen circulated:1.   Tribunals and Medical Boards (G.T.1716)h:;--&apos;;.-.2.   National Service and Employment Exchanges(G.T.1718)Past and present difficulties in connection with recruiting have been and are in my opinion, largely due to incoordination resulting from the distribution to several Departments of responsibility for the administration of the Military Service Acts and of matters inseparably connected with then,For more than twelve months I have believed, and have urged, that the most pressing need was a Department organised to deal comprehensively with this most difficult question of Man-Power.If the suggestions in the papers referred to be adopted, it is necessary to abandon hope that such a Department will be formed.    Their effect in conjunction with the decision to transfer the control of Recruiting to the National Service Department (G.T01647), would be to make the name National Service Department&apos; merely a label for the Directorate of Recruiting after its removal from War Office control.Standing alone, under any name, that Directorate would be powerless to solve the problems which confront it daily.In these circumstances it would collapse. The results would be far reaching, for the fate of the Armies in the Field depends ultimately upon that of the Department which finds them men.A.CA35PBELL GEDDES.loth August, 1917
