MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS OP WAR.ORGANISATION OF MUNITIONS COUNCIL.(1) The recent enormous growth of the Ministry of Munitions, and the extension and multiplication of its duties, render necessary important changes in the system of control.and this single department of State is now employing about 2,000,000 persons, is in contact at innumerable points with almost every business interest in the country and is responsible for expenditure which, may well amount to between six and seven hundred millions a year.(2) The conditions under which the Ministry of Munitions was created were those of intense war emergency. The vital need of supplying the armies in the field with adequate, abundant and finally overwhelming supplies of ammunition, guns and war material of all kinds, necessitated and justified every expedient and the suspension of all ordinary rules. The immense and then unmeasured resources of the United Kingdom afforded an ample field for the enterprise and energy of departmental direction and for the organizing capacity and bold initiative of British business men. Supplies were freely drawn from all parts of the Empire, and purchases from neutral States were used to supplement any deficiencies. As new needs arose they were met. Department was added to department. Military requirements were not only satisfied but anticipated. Vast programmes were successfully carried through. The British armies became the best equipped and most formidably armed in Europe. This process still continues and will become increasingly pronounced.(3) But after these great efforts, and in the fourth year of the war, we are no longer tapping the stored-up resources of National industry or mobilizing them and applying them for the first time to war. The magnitude of the effort and of the achievement approximates continually to the limits of possibility. Already in many directions the frontiers are in sight. It is therefore necessary not simply to expand, but to go back over ground already covered, and by more economical processes, by closer organisa-tion, and by thrifty and harmonious methods, to glean and gather a further reinforcement of war power.(4) It is necessary for this purpose that the Minister of Munitions should be aided and advised by a Council formally established. The time has come to interpose between more than fifty separate departments on the one hand and the Minister on the other, an organism which in the main will play a similar part and serve similar needs as the Board of Admiralty or the Army Council. It has been decided therefore to form the departments of the Ministry into ten groups, classified as far as possible by kindred conditions, placing in superintendence over each group an experienced officer of the Ministry, and to form these officers into a Council for the transaction of business of all kinds in accordance with the general policy which the Minister receives from the Cabinet.(5) It is believed that this can be accomplished without impairing the responsibility or hampering the initiative of the heads of existing departments of the Ministry. It is after all modelled on the only system by which it has been found possible to exercise the control of great armies in the field. The functions of superintendence are distinct from those of direct executive and administrative action, and, wisely exercised, are not a hindrance to it but a stimulus and support. It is indispensable that persons near the heads of very large organisations should not be smothered by detail, or consume them-selves in ordinary day to day business, but that they should have opportunity and freedom to take wide and general- views, and to search resolutely and anxiously amid the incidents of business for the dominant truths. With a proper comprehension of their respective functions, there should be no conflict between the fullest simultaneous exercise Doth of superintendence and action.(6) Another indispensable feature of office organisation lies in the development of a trained and efficient Secretariat. The direction and distribution of the flow of official papers among all the departments, and the means taken to concert the action of the various departments and authorities concerned in each class of business, the recording of action and the circulation of information of all kinds, constitute a sphere second only in importance to decisions on policy and merits. Experience shows the value for these purposes of a strong element of trained civil servants, thoroughly acquainted with official methods and inter-departmental relations. Kecourse at this juncture to a Council of business men already closely associated with the development of the depart-ment together with the strengthening of the Official Secretariat should enable the Ministry, in spite of the increasing difficulties and strain of the war, to continue to render good and remarkable service to the State.18th August, 1917.
