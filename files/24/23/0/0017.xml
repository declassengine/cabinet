SECRET.I ll 11    mG.T.-1717U R     C A d I H S f.^I ^,-2  RATTLE .i Resolution passed by the Staffordshire Chamber ofAgriculture. 1.1  .............    i.ii..........That this Chamber pretests in tho etrongost possible manner against the prices for Cattle fixed by the Food Controller on the ground of the great in-justioe it imposes upon tbo large number of Farmers, who, at the high price ruling in the Springj bought Cattle for Winter feoding which it ie impossible to finish on the grass.   Tho Chamoor would point out that the action of tho Food Controller has entirely destroyed the oonfidenco of the Farmers and gr&amp;vely prejudices the efforts to increase the Food Production of the Country as Farmers csnnot be expected to take the risk of ploughing up grassland or incurring a heavy outlay in manure in an endeavour to add to the yield of the present arable land:,, while there is a danger of tho produce of this land being taken on the same unfair basis as Moat, of which under the present Order there cannot fail to be a great scarcity in the coming Winter and Spring months.14th August, 1917.
