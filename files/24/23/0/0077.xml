5,    The Pension Appeals Tribunal met on the 14th sod ieth instant and heard evident * en T cases acid although their judgment has net ret seen pronounced the chairman, Judge Parry has fairly strongly indicated the line which Is likely to be taken.   He has recofltftended that in deciding on whether^ man is eligible for pension er net , the Ministry, sr, seme one acting on their behalf, should actually see the imjei.   At present the Minibtry largely relies upon the verdict ef the Medical Officers, whe have seen the nan sad found feim unfit far service,       one of whose duties is te advise as ts the eauaatiem ef the disability.    This O^dge Barry meet net sens id er sufficient, and the Minister is mow carefully examining the question.    He has la view that his efforts to arrive at a decision might be strengthened by       * allowing the man, whsse ease has been adversely reported em by the Maval or Army Medical Officers, te appear before his Local Committee, in order that they may fern am opinion, of his case for representation to the Ministry, and he trusts by such a plan to secure that combination ef medical ana lay opinion, which seems to so nosessary for the due consideration ef a nan*s easea.      6n the Mtfe Instant the Minister considered with his Statutory advisers tho question ef pensions te men disabled and te the widows of men deceased as a result ef military service before the present war and decided to make certain recommendations to the Treasury.A full reply to the criticisms em tho Army Officers Warrant ef the Parliamentary War Pensions Bureau was sent te its Secretary on the 17th instant.   It deals mainly with the rather Intricate points of detail.     It was decided that it was not necessary to continue the correspondence en the same subject, but from another point of view in the &quot;Morning Poet&quot;

For the purpose of treatment the Ministry are necessarily taking advantage of the Red Cross Hospitals which have been established in all parts of the country as auxiliary to the military hospital system.    A general agreement has been reached with the authorities of the Society that the fees to be charged in thees hospitals for out-patient treatment shall be those laid doxm in paragraph 3 of the First Schedule ot the Instructions for Traatmant and Training and for in-patient treatment shall be the present average cost, namely 3/9 per day.

which is being manifested should have satisfactory results.0111gaer Local Committee has greatly improved inorganisation but irregularities are still numerous. AtWhitohaven and Workington Local employers readily giveemployment to discharged disabled men but the question israised whether they will be prepared to retain thesedisabled men after the War when able bodied men are availableUpon the Stoke*on-Trent Committee the report is unfavourable;this is due to the working of the sub-committees ofthe five towns in complete disregard of the local committeeat Stoke which, in turn, neglects its duty in respect tothe other towns.   The Inspector of Accounts for Cheshire,Shropshire, and the six counties of Korth Wales reportsthat, with one exception, the work of the various committeesis satisfactory, but points out that     - administrativeexpenses show an upward tendency and will need vigilantsupervision.

opposition of the County Councils, havo not recommended assent. As te (faineborough and Newcastle, although the County Councils were indifferent or not distinctly opposed, the attention of the Minister was called te the small populations and the absence of any strong ground for the proposal.   In the remain-ing seven eases, Tu&amp;bridge Weils, Worthing and five places in Monmouth) no objection was offered.The Minister 1* toting generally on tho foregoing recommendations but as regards Usually Is arranging to confer with representatives of the Borough and Council.A draft scheme for Hove has been approved by the Committee who havo prepared draft schemes for local committees in Ireland.If.       The Statutory Committee held its final meeting 0$ the 16th instant under the presidency of Mr. Barnes, and discussed the arrangements to be made for the transfer of their powers to the Ministry of Pensions on September 1, 1917.A list of such amendments and additions to the regular tlons as had been approved by them during the past eight months, but had not been sanctioned, was discussed.   It was agreed that, even now that tho new warrants for officers and men have been framed, some of those modifications will be required, and it was decided to forward the list to the Pensions Ministry for the consideration of the new Special Grants Committee.The Statutory Committee put on record their great appreciation of the manner in which the Vice Chairman, Mr. Cyril Jackson, had carried out his duties and passed votes of thanks to various gentlemen who had given their services voluntarily at the Central office during the past ysar.The Committee are, in the opinion of tho Minister,fully justified in the belief expressed at*t.hle last meetingthat

It was resolved that  5000 should be handed over by the Red Cross Society through the Institutional Committee to the South Eastern Scotland Joint District Committee to carry out the equipment and arrangements generally and to take a 5 years1 lease of it with a break on either side at 3 years.   Bailie Adams was thanked by the Committee for the trouble he had taken in the matter and undertook to place the who^ the South Eastern Joint District Committee. Orthopaedic Annexes.Sir Robert Jones, upon the invitation of the Chairman, made a statement as to the necessity for Orthopaedic Annexes for discharged sailors and soldiers in Scotland, and  ir George Beatson announced that the Scottish Red Cross .iad agreed to vote  10,000 as a minimum towards the cost of their erection.(1)   It was agreed that an annexe be established at Gordon College, Aberdeen, and that the Northern Joint District*Committee be asked to undertake the arrangements and to appoint a Sub-Committee for the purpose, and to co-opt Colonel RiddelL. on to the Sub-Committee.(2)   Dundee.&apos;  Lady Baxter stated that Dudhope House could be leased at  160 for five years, and that a hostel with treatment could be carried out there, or else additional apparatus for massage and electric treatment could be placed at the infirmary.     The scheme was approved generally, and it was agreed that the Central Joint Area Committee be asked to appoint a Sub-Committee to make arrangements, and to co-opt aMedical
Medical Adviser and also a representative Of tho Red Cross Society.(3) Edinburgh.     Bailie Adams announced that the Joint Committee were considering a scheme.   It was agreed that the Joint Committee should appoint a Sub-Committee, and that the scheme should if possible be brought up at the next meeting.(4) Glasgow.   It was agreed that the same procedure should be adopted in Glasgow, and that the Joint Committee should be asked to co-opt Sir George Beatson on to a Sub-Committee.Bpilepsy.   Dr. Bond on the invitation of the Chairman made a general statement as to the necessity for an Epileptic Colony in Scotland.     A Sub-Committee was appointed to enquire into the whole question, consisting of Sir George Beatson, Colonel Macpherson, and Bailie Adams,&apos;to report to the next Meeting.Rheumatism. Colonel Riddell explained the arrangements which.had been made at Moffat and Strathpeffer.   It was agreed that a circular should be sent to all Local Committees in Scotland informing them that arrangements could be made to treat a limited number of discharged sailors and soldiers suffering   from Rheumatism at these two places:   application to be made to the Secretary of the Joint Area Committee in each case.   The Secretary of the Joint Area Committee should notify the Local Director of the Red Cross in order to make arrangements.Tuberculosis.   Colonel Riddell reported as to the offer ofMrs. Stewart Mackenzie of Seaforth, Brahan Castle, CononbridgoRoss-shire to provide a Sanatorium.   The Chairman undertookto enquire into the matter and report.Paraplegia.        Sir George Beatson reported that he hadhad an interview .vith the Duke of Portland as to providinga
General Board op Control, 25 Palmerston Place, -Edinburgh,July 1917.Instructions relating to the Classification and Treatment of Soldiers and Sailors as &quot;Service Patients.&quot;1. Every soldier and sailor who has been awarded, as the result of service during the present Avar, a disability pension, and who, on the 1st of August 1917, is a patient in a Royal, District or Parochial Lunatic Asylum in Scotland, or who, subsequent to that date, may be admitted as a&apos; patient into any such Institution, is entitled to be placed on the list of private patients and treated as a &quot; Sendee Patient.&quot;2. Sanction has also been given to the treatment of non-pensionable cases (that is, cases in which the malady was not due to or aggravated by military service) as &quot;Service Patients &quot; for the period of the war, and Twelve months after, subject to the condition that it shall not extend to cases in which there is evidence that the man has been confined in an Asylum before enlistment. The records of the Asylum to which a sailor or soldier is admitted should be examined to see if this condition is fulfilled in so far as that Asylum is concerned.3. No soldier or sailor admitted to an Asylum is to be placed on the &quot; Service Patient &quot; list until notice has been received from the Minister of Pensions that he is &quot;entitled to be classed as a &quot; Service Patient.&quot;Medical Superintendents should intimate forthwith to the Secretary of the Ministry of Pensions and also to the Board : (a) The names of all patients now in asylums who have served in the army or navy during the present war, and not at present treated as &quot; Service Patients,&quot; giving particulars, so far as known, as to age, regiment or ship, army or navy number, and rank; and(6) Similar intimation to the Pensions Minister and the Board uponthe admission of,.patients who have served in the army or navy during the present war stating the form of admission, i.e. Sheriffs Order or Army warrant. 4. When a discharged soldier has been admitted under Section 91 of tlie Army Act, or a sailor has been admitted under Section 3 of the &quot;&apos;\&apos;aval Enlistment Act, 1884 (adapting to sailors the provisions of Section 91 of the Army Act), inquiry should be made of the Pension issue Office, Baker Street, London, W. 1, as to whether such discharged soldier or sailor is to be treated as a &quot; Service Patient.&quot;In the case of a male patient admitted .on an Order of the Sheriff, whenever the admission papers contain any statements to suggest that &apos; lie man has been serving as a soldier or sailor during the war, or any ^formation to this effect is forthcoming from the Inspector of Poor, or other person escorting the patient, or otherwise, similar inquiry should &quot;lso be made.In each instance the inquiry should be accompanied by a short ! tatement of the facts that have been elicited and the reasons for thinkingM &amp; G Ltd Wt 2081/562 7-17  1250 G. 2
that the patient has beeu serving in either branch of His Majesty&apos;s Forces and may or should be entitled to be treated as a &quot; Service Patient/&apos; together with the opinion in writing of the Medical Superintendent on the medical aspects of the case.It is desirable that any information so obtained either for or against the supposition that the man is entitled to be treated as a &quot; Service Patient &quot; should be promptly and prominently entered in the case book. If no such information is obtainable at the time of admission the Medical Superintendent should, as subsequent opportunities arise, endeavour to clear up the position.5. Evidence whenever obtained tending to show that a, man lias served in the Army or Navy during the present war should be at once communicated to the Pension Issue Office, with the object of ascertainin;; whether the man is entitled to be treated as a &quot; Service Patient.&quot;6. So soon as information has been received from the Pension Issue Office that a man is entitled to be so treated, the Medical Super-intendent should at once classify him as a &quot; Service Patient &quot; and notify the Local War Pensions Committee, the Pension Issue Office, and the General Board of Control, that this has been done, and should at the same time inform the Local War Pensions Committee of the man&apos;s place of residence.7. The Medical Superintendent should use his best endeavours to see that the names of all ex-soldiers and ex-sailors in his Asylum are intimated to the Ministry of Pensions in accordance with Instruction 3 with a view to getting placed on the &quot; Service Patient &quot; list all who air entitled to be so classed.8. As from the date contained in the notice authorising classifica-tion as a &quot; Service Patient&quot; the Minister of Pensions will become responsible for all payments on behalf of the man under the scheme. Any formal agreement to this effect has been decided to be unnecessary.9. Accounts for the maintenance of &quot; Service Patients &quot; should be presented quarterly to the Pension Issue Office as soon as practicable after the 15th August, 15th November, 15th February and 15th May. The accounts should include and indicate separately: (a) the cost of maintenance calculated at the current weekly pauperrate;(b) the additional 3s. 9d. per week per patient payable to the asylum&apos; authorities under the terms of the scheme ;(c) the special grant up to 2s. 6d. per week per patient for extra com-forts, whenever such grant is made ; id) the cost of reasonable travelling expenses incurred under Instruc-tion 14;(e) funeral expenses of a patient dying in the Institution (see Instruc-tion 15)..10. Each asylum authority will supply their &quot; Service Patients &quot; with suitable private clothing, the cost of which, so far as it is not met by th charge for clothing included in the current weekly pauper rate, should b-defrayed out. of the additional 3s. 9d. (see Instruction 9 (&amp;)) which the asylum authority will receive ; any balance on this sum will be placed t&quot; the credit of the Building and &quot;Repairs Fund Account.It is proposed that a small appropriate badge shall be worn by each &quot; Service Patient &quot; on his jacket, and that there shall be one distinctiv badge for ex-soldiers and one for ex-sailors. Particulars of these badge and information as to their cost and where they can be obtained wil! be furnished by the General Board of Control so soon as the badges hav received the respective approval of the War Office and the Admiralty.The jackets, waistcoats, trousers and overcoat intended for paupe patients must not be worn by &quot; Service Patients,&quot; but it will be lef
entirely to the Medical Superintendent to determine what clothing should be worn (a) by a patient when employed on the farm or gardens, or in other work;(6) by a sick patient; and(c) by&apos;a patient whose habits are fault)&quot; or destructive. 11. The provisions of Section 16 of the Lunacy (Scotland) Act, 1862, with regard to the sending of patients &quot;on probation&quot; with a view to discharge and of Section 6 of the Lunacy (Scotland) Act, 1866, authorising the temporary absence of a patient on pass from an asylum for 28 days will apply to the case of a &quot; Service Patient,&quot; but unless the circum-stances are exceptional and except with the sanction of the General Board of Control the period of probation shall not extend be)^ond one month.When a patient is absent &quot; on probation &quot; or &quot; pass &quot; the asylum authority will continue to charge for him as though he were in the asylum ; but they will hand over, in fortnightly instalments, either to the patient himself, or to his friends, whichever the asylum authority thinks best, for his maintenance, while on probation, a sum of money equivalent to the amount received by them from the Minister of Pensions for his maintenance, plus the special grant of 2s. 6d. The additional 3s. 9d. during the period of probation will still be credited to the Building and Repairs Fund Account.12. As &quot; Service Patients&quot; are on the - legal footing of private patients, the provisions of the Lunacy Acts as to private patients will be applicable to them, one of the most important matters in connection with which is the power to discharge a patient from an Asylum, which is dealt with under Section 92 of the Lunacy (Scotland) Act of 1857, Section 17 of the Lunacy (Scotland) Act, 1862, and Section 55 (3) of the Mental Deficiency and Lunacy (Scotland) Act, 1913. In the case of a &quot; Service Patient &quot; there will ordinarily be no petitioner, and it is probable that occasional instances will occur in which the friends desire to take the patient out of the Asylum and to look after him at home, though he has not recovered. If the Medical Superintendent advises or approves this course, no difficulty will arise, but they will sometimes be anxious to discharge the patient against the advice of the Superin-tendent that such a course is likely to be prejudicial to him. The Super -intendent cannot refuse to obey the direction of the friends to dis-chargebut he is authorised to inform them that he (the Superin-tendent) is deemed by the Minister of Pensions to be the person certifying that the man requires medical treatment in an Asylum (see Article 6 of the Royal AVarrant for the pensions of soldiers and sailors and the definition of &quot; Certified &quot;in Article 24 (8)), and that, if they insist on his discharge, the chance of the patient being again received as a &quot;Service Patient&quot; into &quot;the Asylum will be jeopardised, and that, in addition, he may possibly lose a part of his pension as provided by Article 4.   ,13. Subject, to Instructions 2 and 12, the Medical Superintendent of his own accord can, on the re-admission of a patient who has previously been on the footing of a-&quot; Service Patient,&quot; at once.re-classify him as a &quot; Service Patient.&quot;A &quot; Service Patient&quot; whose discharge has been insisted upon by friends contrary to the advice of the Medical Superintendent, if re-admitted, can-not be again classified as a &quot;Service Patient&quot; without reference to the Minister of Pensions.14. The Minister of Pensions hopes that too much insistence will not be laid upon permanently retaining a &quot; Service Patient&quot; in the Asylum to which he would have gone if he were a pauper, and which
Secretary.may be in quite a different part of the country to that in which his wife, family or friends are living. The main object of the scheme is to secure the happiness and contentment of the patient and to consult the convenience of his friends. An Asylum Authority will have power to arrange with another Asylum Authority for transference of a case where there is good reason for this to be done, and the General Board of Control will be prepared to give facilities for the removal of such cases. Probably, in the long-run, such transfers would fall&apos;fairly equally on all Asylum Authorities.The reasonable travelling expenses incurred by Asylum Authorities in connection with such transfers will be defrayed by the Minister of Pensions.15. The burial expenses of &quot; Service Patients &quot; dying in the asylum will be defrayed by the Minister of Pensions. As a general rule, tin-funeral expenses of a patient should not exceed  1. If the friends of a patient wish to remove the body for burial, a sum not exceeding this amount maybe given to them for this purpose, which will be refunded by the Minister of Pensions.16. The Minister of Pensions will leave the following additional matters to be determined by the Asylum Authority on the advice of their Medical Superintendent: (a) which patients are capable of appreciating and benefiting bythe special grant up to 2s 6d. ; upon what additional corn-forts the money should be spent; and whether the patient may,properly be entrusted with spending the money himself ;(b) the fitness of a patient for being sent &quot; on pass or probation &quot;or fordischarge.17. On the discharge of a &quot;Service Patient&quot; notice should be sent to the Pension Issue Office and the Local War Pensions Committee of the man&apos;s proposed place of residence in order that the former may make any necessary change in the amount of payments to the man and to his wife and family, and that the Local War Pensions Committee may keep an eye on him.18. The. Pension Issue Office should also be informed as speedily as possible of the removal and admission under Instruction 14; of the re-admission ; and of the death of all &quot; Service Patients.&quot;

It is considered that for in-patient treatment payment at the rate of 3/9 a day would cover the average cost and arrangements on this basis may therefore be made.In regard to out-patient treatment the terms stated in Paragraph 3 of Schedule I. of the Instructions have been agreed to on behalf of these Institutions. 8/17(12886.)

Treatment        Report on schemes submitted etc., in week endedAugust 15th 1917*1.    The Joint Committee for Leinster and Connaught submitted a scheme for Institutional treatment in the area under their control.   Provisional sanction has been given to the arrangements proposed, and a statement containing the information required for the general scheme to be submitted in accordance with the recent instructions has been forwarded to the Committee.2.    The Willesden Local Committee submitted a scheme for institutional treatment in the area under their control and also for Home Treatment by General Practitioners.   Provision-al sanction has been accorded to the use of most of the institutions and some further information has been requested in a few esses.    As regards Home Treatment, the suggestion that  .2 3, treatment should be dealt with outside the national Health Insurance Act and paid for by the Local Committee could vet be accepted, as the special arrangements made by the National Health Insurance Commissioners would be affected. It was suggested that the Committee should consult the Local Committee for the County of Middlesex with a view to sub-mitting a single scheme for the whole area of the County, and a letter has also been sent to the County Committee forwarding a list of all the Military and Auxiliary Hospitals in ^heir area and asking them to submit a general scheme on these lines.3.      The Denbighshire Local Committee asked for sanction to use the Llcndrindod Wells Hospital for cases of Rheumatism.   The proposal has been sanctioned provisionally and a list of tho Military Auxiliary k Red Cross Hospitals in the county has been forwarded on the form required foruse
use in the preparation of a general scheme for institutional treatment.4.      The Local Committee for Portsmouth submitted a scheme for institutional treatment which has been sanctioned provisionally.     Steps are being taken to facilitate the submission of a general scheme by the Joint Committee for the South Central Area with a view to placing the facilities of the whole area at the disposal of all the Local Committees included in the counties administered by the Joint Committee.

He has also offered to pay a grant of 5/- a Wbok to married men during their training, in addition to the maintenance allowance paid - to them under the Royal Warrant.2* Sanction has been given to. a schemesubmitted by the Local Committee for Wimbledon teprovide training for disabled men in Agricultureand Nurserymen1s work with the firms ofMessrs.

, : APPENDIX XIV.WAR PENSIONS &amp;c, STATUTORY COMMITTEE.442REPORT TO THE PENSIONS MINISTERFor week ended loth August, 1917,ORGANIZATION BRANCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors of Accounts.COUNTY OF MONMOUTH LOCAL COMMITTEE.Our Inspector visited the Secretary of the Comnittee and the Clerk in charge of the work on 31st July.As a result of the interview a basis was formed for a reorganization of the Ccunty work and it will now be for the Sub-Oommittees to carry out their part to ensure the success of the scheme.     With the exception of matters to be referred to London, the responsibility of the whole of the work will rest on the Sup-Committees.     Instructions will be issued on the pointa of proper case investigation and filling up of case-papers, Recoverable and Emergency Grants.     The Sub-Committees will be asked to deal with the Register for Disabled Men, to set up a true and complete reoor*d of each case and to take a general interest in the men, especially from the treatment and training standpoint.     The system should do away with a lot of unnecessary and irritating work and with the better feeling whioh is mani-festing itself all round, the work should in the future become smoother and more satisfactory.     The County people are quite appreciative of the assistance given throughout their area but the intervention of an outsider has done muoh to bring about a general improvement.GSLLIGAER LOCAL COMMITTEE.It will be remembered that this is one of the Local Committees previously very badly reported on. Our Inspeotor reports great improvement in organization but there are still numerous irregularities whioh have been sent to the Statutory Committee for their observations.A member of the Comnittee, who is also a Trade and Labour Representative, is applying for the post of Enquiry Officer;   his   appointment would not appear to be a suitable one.There are about 120 discharged men in the district, nearly all working.     A few are waiting for institutional treatment.
MlTEHAVEN , LOCAL COISIIT3JEE.The organization and administration are working satisfactorily.The Local Committee has been fortunate enough to place all disabled soldiers with the Whitehaven Colliery Company, but it should be mentioned that these men were all connected with mining in some way or other before the war.Tne books are accurately and neatly kept but though ready, the accounts have not yet been audited for the June Quarter,WORKING-TOR LOCAL COMMITTEE.The organization and administration appear now to be satisfactory.It is found here as in Whitehaven that employment is readily given by local employers to discharged disabled soldiers.Whilst employers gladly give work now to maimed men, that they will be prepared to retain them after the war when able-bodied men may be expected to be available may well be questioned.     Neither in the interests of the men nor of the Government can this solution of this1 important question be regarded ad satisfactory, for it merely postpones any well considered treatment until a time arrives when its permanent settlement may have to be faced under less favourable conditions.STOKE-ON-TRENT LOCAL COMMITTEE.This Committee is singularly different from any other County Borough Committee.     Normally an ordinary County Borough but aotually, and in the practical work, there are really six Committees entirely independent of each other.     The six Committoes represent Burslem with a population of 41,000, Penton with a population of 25,000, Hanley with a population of 66,000, Lcngton with a population of 37,000, Stoke with a population of 38,000, and Tunstall and Golders Hill with a population of 37,000.     Stoke is the headquarters of the Looal Committee and at Stoke the meetings are held.     The other Committees resent this arrangement and in their estimation ooneider themselves quite as eligible for the headquarters of the Local Committee.     Thsre is a strong feeling of -resentment against Stoke being the centre of the looal government of the^potteries,     The Local Comnittee   have been most negligent of i*S duty to the other towns, they have constituted them Sub-Committees and then left them entirely without direction or control.     As a oonsequenoe every Sub-Committee is working quite independently and in complete indifference to the head-quarters at Stoke.The work regardinc disabled men has been almost entirely oonfined to the giving of grants,     The Inspector disoussed the situation with all the Honorary Officers of the Sub-Committees and pointed out to them the very serious position natters had assumed as regards their general work, particularly the character of their work on behalf of disabled men;    his strictures were generally admitted to be justified.
They appear to be seriously concerned and anxious to improve but remarked that until Stoke took up the work seriously, real improvement oould not be expected.     The alternative preferred would be that each of the Sub-Committees should be given complete autonomy as a separate Local Committee.     The state of affairs generally of the Stoke-on-Trent Local Committee area is rather disquieting.Extracts from the General Reports of Inspectors on their area.Our Inspector for Cheshire, Shropshire and the six Counties of North Wales lately reported as follows:-With one exception of which I have already made report the work and management of the various Committees in my area may be regarded as satisfactory and especially so when the great part that voluntary work plays in their organization is remembered. Like all human systems, voluntaryism has its imperfections and.disadvantages but it may be stated with oonfidenoe and truth that in a time of stress and need it has in connection with the granting of pensions to sailors and soldiers and allowances to their dependants, done the nations work.Administrative expenses show a tendency to increase and the payment now authorised to be made to members of Committees will, it is feared, materially swell this item and in our Inspectorfs opinion is likely to diminish the supply of voluntary aid.     These expenses will need a constant and vigilant supervision in the future.Regarding the training of disabled officers and men, several conferences have been held and it has been decided that the committees of Cheshire shall amalgamate with those of North Wales for this purpose.     North WaleB was somewhat in favour of uniting with South Wales so aB to bring the whole principality under one scheme.     One of the main arguments was that as South Wales had the money and North Wales had the intelligence, partnership would be mutually advantageous. South Wales proved reluctant to the argument adduced.Special or Emergency Grants are more than other allowances in the discretion of the Committee the most valuable feature of the Regulations.The confidence displayed by the Statutory Committee in permitting such latitude to the Local Committee, was found in only one case to have been abused.Reporting on the group of Counties containing Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire Kent Oxford, Surrey and Sussex, our Inspector   says the results have been a better understanding not only of the Regulations but of the necessity of their being adhered to. Where cases are submitted to the Local Committees very few errors have been found but in sub-divisions not under the control of the Local Committee, not only errors but difficulties have arisen owing to the non-use of casepapers and the required information not being obtainable at the inspection.
-v   o ^ nv7he??ver possible he; had attended meetings of the Sub-Committees for the purpose of fully explaining the forms of application, the Regulations and the work generally and answering all points raised by members present.   The result has been most-satisfactory and keener interest in the work has been aroused.PENSIONS   BRANCH.Of the individual cases considered during the week there is none which calls for special comment.FINANCE.  s     d.Amounts advanced to LocalCommittees 38,258.   0.   0Other Expenditure      8    dTemporary Grants outof voluntary funds 132. 11. 2.Salaries &amp; Wages 512.   2. 8.Travelling Expenses 96. 13. 2741.   7.   0.  36,999.    7.   0.Voluntary Contributions Nil.OFFICERS&apos; SUB-COMMITTEE.

APPENDIX XV.REPORT OF THE ORGANIZATION AND GENERAL PURPOSES UB-COKMITTSB OF THE&apos; WAR PENSIONS &amp;e. , STATUTORY COMMITTEE.30th July &amp; 9th August 1917.We have held two meetings since the last meeting of the Statutory Committee,We have had before us 16 cases in which application for a separate Local Committee had been made to the Minister of Pensions under Section 3 of the Naval and Military Jar Pensions csc., (Administrative Expenses) Act 1917.We have reported to the Minister on all these cases after communicating on his behalf with the County Councils concerned.In two instances. (Maidstone &amp; Stafford) we have in reporting to the 1&apos;inister pointed out that these places ao County Towns are the seato of the County Local Cc&amp;aaittees, and that it would seem that as regards them, effect might be given to the opinion generally expressed at the Conference with representatives of various Associations of Local Bodies held at the Ministry last June, viz. that in such circumstances as these, separate Local Committees should not be constituted.In five cases (Erith, Gosport and Alverstoke, Guildford, Llanelly and Richmond) we have not felt in a position to recommend assent, looking to the grounds of opposi-tion of the County Councils concerned.As regardc the applications from Gainsborough and Newcastle under Lyne, respecting which the County Councils were indifferent or not distinctly opposed, we so informed the Minister, at the same time calling attention to the small population of these places, and the absence of any strong ground for the propooal made.In the remaining seven cases (Tunbridge Wells, Worthing and five places in Konmouthshire viz. Abersychan, Abertillery, Bedwelty, Ebbw Vale and Tredegar) we offered no objection to the grant of separate Local Committeest but we urged that in the Monmouthshire cases there should be an understanding with the Urban District Councils that the need for proper organisation and strict observance of the Regulations would be impressed on the Local Committees.As mentioned in our last Report the Minister decided that a separate Local Committee should be constituted for the Borough of Hove.   We have since approved of the draft Scheme for this purpose which was submitted to us by the town Council.
9.    We stated in a previous Report that there were- thenCounties in Ireland in rerpect of which no Scheme for Local Committees had been submitted, and-that we had asked for instructions frrm the hinister of Pensions as to the com se to be taken with regard to these cases. The Minister has now intimated his wi3h that steps should be taken by the Statutory Committee to frame Schemes themselves for these Counties.   We have prepared Draft Schemes accordingly, and are in communication with Mr. Lane, the Inspector for Ireland, as to the Bodies - and Organizations to be represented on the Local Committees.10.   We have now completed the Report of the Statutory Committee for 1916 (including an addendum relating to the work of the Committee during the present year).   The Tables cf Accounts in the Appendix will be made up to the 25th instant, after which date no paymento will be made.11.   Arrangements have been effected in consultation with theMinister for the appointment of representatives of the Ministry and of Inspectors of Accounts in the districts covered by the Joint Committees for Treatment and      * Training.   There are 12 such districts in England, 2 in Wales, 4 in Scotland and 3 in Ireland.   In six districts the representatives will also discharge the duties of Inspector of Accounts, and in 15 these duties will be performed by a separate Officer.12.   We have approved Circulars to Local Committees relating toTreatment and Training of Disabled Hen (Ho.5?) Openings in Industry for such men in Agricultural Motor Tractor Work, (No.58) and Increase in gratuities under the Order in Council and Royal Warrant (No.59).S. B. PROVISChairman.13th August 1917,
