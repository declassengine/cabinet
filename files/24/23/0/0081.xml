Operations. G.O.C. Mesopotamia.SECRET17,8.17.C.I.G.S. War Office, repeated India,X.3234.Your 39445..On receipt of your 39253, I arranged with Baratoff to place supplies at Baqubah for his 13,500 men and 9000 animals.     These supplies to be available from, date of his troops reoccupation of line of Dialha when they are therefore in position to draw from Baqubah,     Supply column to be provided by Baratoff for this purpose as originally suggested in my P.S.M.35 June 18th and agreed to by him, I have told him that I will place remounts and drafts and reasonable amount of military stores and ammunition at Baqubah, if he will have them delivered at Basrah as required and that I will evacuate his sick and wounded from Baqubah, if he will send them there,     I have impressed upon him importance of reoccupying as soon as possible line of Dialha in view of fact that cooler weather will commence shortly and that enemy are daily strengthening that line and have suggested that in addition to force sent to me, he should maintain garrisons at Pai-Tak, Hamadan and Kermanshah.     Prom your 39445 and other indications, it seems unlikely Russians v/ill move on Caucasus front.   This as foreshadowed in my X.2859 and subsequent telegrams must of necessity restrict any offensive action by me up Tigris, even supposing Valbolski makes vigorous stroke at Mosul, which seems unlikely as stronger enemy pressure down Euphrates v/ill be result of inaction   in Caucasus., It appears likely that enemy&apos;s plan of campaign will be enveloping one, pushing forward through Jemiscacal, Hamrin and down Euphrates.     Against former, Baratoff&apos;s detachment amounting, approximately to British scale, to one cavalry division and one strong infantry brigadewill
will be helpful if it will fight at all.   My doubt is whether it will now be able to regain line of Dialha but we will try and pull it in somehow, if it will only make the effort.   It-is disappointing to see prospect of vigorous allied offensive vanishing for second time since we reached Baghdad: but Russian disintegration shows clearly -that this can no longer be reckoned upon.     Opportunities may however still occur for limited offensive, which if planned with, discretion will obviate our being relegated to that passive attitude, which will give enemy his best opportunity and at same time gradually damp our troops fighting spirits.     Your latest telegrams are most encouraging, as they indicate that you still extend to me -within reasonable limits that freedom of action which you have always, given me, subject to policy imposed by His Majesty1s Government; and it is needless to say how much this helps me in ray endeavour to do my best to carry out principles you outline.     I have just completed tour of ? British cavalry division and 3 divisions and have inspected defensive lines which we have designed and prepared.     The troops I found everywhere, in spite of recent severe heat looking well, happy and brimful of fighting spirits.     Their training has progressed under difficult conditions in a satisfactory manner and positions which I inspected closely have,been well prepared,,   Sick list, except for effect of heat now fast disappearing; this is most satisfactory.     I have reason therefore to look forward to.future with confidence and feel satisfied that all ranks of this army which has done so splendidly in. the past will again-give of its best however arduous the task may be before it.
