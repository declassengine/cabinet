Sir,Supply of Fertilleers.1 am directed by the Eoard of Agrioulture for Scotland to refer to their circular letter of the 28th June last, arid.to en-quire whether you are now in a position to furnish a list of the names and addresser of firms who, whether as Bianufaoturers or as agents, supply (!) fertilisers and feeding.stuffs, or (2) agricul-tural and horticultural seeds in the area of your Committee.   This information is urgently required, and the Board would be glad to receive it by. return of pust. .Baglo Slag.The.Board would also be glad to reoeire information on the following points:-(1)   Whether any merchants or farmers in the area of your Committee have been unable to book orders for a sufficient supply of Basio Slag, either to.be delivered immediately or at a later date.   The names and addresses of such merchants or farmers should be stated *(2)   Whether your Supplies Committee hare been in communication with looal merchants with a view to ascertaining whether the latter have booked orders for Basic Slag sufficient to meet not only tnb normal demands of the district but also the augmented demand likely to result from the efforts that may be made to improve pasture and, other crops in 1918.   If this has been done perhaps the Cosaaittefc-will say whether in their opinion adequate provision has been mads..The Board have been given to understand that orders for the larger part of the seasons output of Basic Slag are already booksd, and in order to ensure that dietricts not already supplied may obtain an equitable proportion of the remaining supply available, it is essential that arrangements in thie direction should be made at the earliest po&amp;sible dafce*   In these circumstances, ycur Committee will no doubt realise the importance of having the in-formation indicated above forwarded to the Board in as complete a form and as expeditiously ae possible.Sulphate of Ammonia.The Board would again remind the Committee that if the production of this feitiliesr is to be maintained and the maximum quantity for hone use ecouied., steps must be ta&amp;en to prevent congestion at the works during, the epiiimer and autumn months.   This can only be effected if manure mixers., agricultural merchants, co-operative societies and famors are prepared without delay to place their orders with the manufacturers, and the Board would impress upon /Any further communications should be addressed, not to any individual by name, but to-&quot;The Secretary,Board of Agriculture tor Scotland, 29 St. Andrew Square, I Edinburgh. &quot;Correspondents are requested: 1.

upon the Committee the need for keeping this fact prominently before all persons in their district who still have to book their supplies for next season.General.On the general question of the supply of all kinds of fertilisers for the 1918 crop, the Board are advised that unless farmers place their ordere not labsr fchan let September with the merchants or direot with the manufacturers fshould this be more oonrenient. ih individual oases) no assurance can be given either tfyat sufficient supplies will be forthcoming or that the available supplies will be.equitably allocated as between the varioue dis-triota of the oountry.   They would therefore urge your Committee to take immediate steps to bring this fact prominently before the farmers in their, district, either by advertisement or Press notice and by any other effeotive methods that may suggest themselves to the Committee.I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,H.

ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH.1917 .SUPPLY Off FERTILISESI am directed by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to state that they have had under oomideration the question of the supply of fertilisers for tho 1918 orop and in connection therewith  iotriot Agricultural Committees have been requested to urge farmers to place the whole of their orders for next season either with merchants or manufacturers not later than 1st September.As you may be aware a survey is at pr^csnt being made of all agricultural land in the United ICing-doa with a view to extending the area under tillage in 1918; and, if this is done to the extent propoced, the demand for ei*tificir,l manures will be very considerably augmented.   The Board would be glad to be informed, therefore, whether thi&amp; possibility has been taken into account by your firm in &amp;stSorting their probable r$-quiremsnte for the coming ceason, and. if bo, whether you have been fortunate enough, to bock orders either with manufacturers or wholesale merchants for the whole of the supplies whioh you will require later in the season for re-sale to your customers.If congestion in the Spring months, both at the Works and on the railways, is to be avoided it would appear to be necessary that merchants, who have the necessary /
at the earliest possible date.    The Board recognise, however, that the question of adequate and suitable storage a^ommoda-tion may present a real difficulty to many traders, and they would be glad to learn whether this difficulty has arisen in your oase and, if so, whether your firm either on their own initiative or in conjunction with the Supplies Sub-Committee of the District Agricultural Committee have been able to overcome it.At the moment there is a probability that the supply of certain kinds of manures may not be sufficient to meet the demands of the whole country and in that event it might be necessary to devise a scheme of distribution whioh would ensure that the available supply is equitably allooated between the various districts.    In view of this contingency the Board are anxious to have before them particulars of the quantities of Sulphate of Ammonia, Basic Slag and Superphosphates already ordered by your firm together with an estimate of the a&amp;dit-tional quantities of each of these manures whioh will yet be required.Oopiss of forme on which the relative particulars ars to be entered are enclosed herewith and as the, question of the supply of Basio Slag is partioiiqa,rly urgent the Board would be obliged if the return relating to this manure oould be completed and forwarded to this office not later than Saturday the 11th instant.     In returning the form perhaps you will kindly state whether you have experienced any difficulty in placing your orders for Basic Slag and, if so, the name and address of the firm who have intimated their inability to accept your orders might be furnished for the Board&apos;s informa-ttion.
P.-8. The forms for Superphosphates and Sulphate of Ammonia will be sent later.I am to add that in approaching your firm in this connection the Board desire solely to ohtaJjx^l^&quot;ble^iJifor2iia--ttion as to the present position of the supply of artificial manures and any particulars you may he good enough to furnish will &quot;be regarded as strictly confidential.A copy of a memorandum intimating the arrangements that hare been made for the supply of Sulphate of Ammonia is enclosed herewith for your information.I am, Gentlemen,Your obedient Servant,H.
