From Viceroy, Army Department, l\th August 1917. (Received 2.30 pan.)11,833. Reference to your telegram of 25th May and your telegram of the 24th ultimo, 1358. We consider that although river conservancy, especially on Tigris is paramount, irrigation measures on Euphrates may be necessary as maintenance works and that Sir P. Cox should have an adviser available for the purpose. We do not consider a man of Buchanan&apos;s eminence necessary for this duty. We are asking General Officer Commanding, &quot;. D,&quot; if he can make a suitable man available,.Above has been repeated to General Officer Commanding, Force &quot; D.&quot;
