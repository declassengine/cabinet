Where barley is bought by a licensed manufacturer for the purpose of his business or by a recognised dealer for re-sale for such manufacture, 5s. Zd. per quarter may be added to the standard rate.In the case of damaged wheat or rye, or tailings and dressings, 7s. per quarter shall be deducted from the standard rate; in the case of barley 7s. Qd. per quarter; and in the case of improperly cleaned oats or tailings and dressings, 5s. per quarter.Certain additions are permitted in the case of purchases from recognised dealers other than the producers.   Where the purchase is.: made by a flour miller for the purpose of his mill, Is. per quarter may be added to the price otherwise applicable.   Where it is made otherwise. than by a flour miller, 2s. per quarter may be added. In cases where the purchase does not exceed 15 sacks of a particular grain in seven consecutive days, the added price may be 4s. per quarter, and where it does not amount to one sack in the same period, the added price may be 8s. per quarter.Payments for purchases made under this Order are to be uet cash within seven days, with interest at 5 per cent, or at bank rate, whichever is higher, on amounts outstanding after that period.This Order revokes the 1917&apos; Crop Restriction Order, except as regards potatoes.(2) The Winter Oats and Eye (Restriction) Order, 1917, dated August 14,1917, prohibits the use before November 1, 1917, of any winter oats grown in the United Kingdom in 1917, or before January 1 next any rye so grown for any purpose other than seed. While these restrictions are in force dealings in winter oats and rye are limited to persons ordinarily dealing in them for the purpose of seed or to persons requiring them for that purpose.   The Order does not apply in Scotland or Ireland.(3) Under the Beans, Peas, and Pulse (Retail Prices) Order, 1917, a General Licence, dated August 14, 1917, authorises the retail sale of peas in 1 lb., 2 lb., or I lb. packets at fixed prices. Such packets may contain only peas and a bag of cooking requisites, and there must be printed ona   (33)3659-3   Pk 1   00   8/17   E S A

No barley flour must be used on or after the same date except in the manufacture of articles suitable for and to be used as human food; and no barley or barley flour or any article containing either must be so damaged or treated as to be rendered less fit for the purpose for which it is reserved under the Order. The question whether any barley is unfit for milling or any barley is unfit for human food shall be determined by the Food Controller, or in England and Wales and Scotland by the local authority empowered to enforce this Order.Organisation.On August 11, Lord Rhondda cabled his congratulations to Mr. Hoover on his appointment as American Food Controller, and he has received the following reply:-Washington, August 14, 1917. &quot;Appreciate your congratulatory cable and reciprocate your good wishes. It is obvious that we cannot expect results hoped for without closest co-operation.&quot;* , Hoover.In order to enable the work which will be involved in the investigation of the costs of food production and distribution to be effectively carried out, leading firms of accountants in all parts of the United Kingdom have been invited by the Food Controller to act in an honorary capacity as supervising accountants for their districts under the immediate direction of Mr. W. H. Peat, who has been appointed Financial Secretary of the Ministry of Food.Progress is being made in the appointment of Local Food Committees on the lines indicated in a circular letter to Local Authorities from the President of the Local Government Board covering a letter from the Food Controller. The request that each Committee shall contain at least one representative of labour and one woman is being interpreted strictly, and both workers and women are complaining of inadequate representation. In view, however, of the fact that much of the work will be done by sub-committees which will allow the inclusion of a greater number of labour and women representatives, it is anticipated that this irritation will presently subside.Enforcement of Orders.Potatoes. A Perthshire potato vendor was fined 75Z. with alternative of three months&apos; imprisonment for selling seed potatoes above the maximum price.A potato vendor from whom returns had been demanded under Regulation 2G was prosecuted at the request of this Ministry for failing to make a return and wras fined 5Z.A report was received that Main Crop potatoes were being sold on the Norwich market in contravention of the 1917 Crop (Restriction) Order, 1917. The police made an investigation.at this Ministry^ request and the charge was proved to be without foundation.Price of Milk Orders, 1917. A great number of complaints of illegal prices have been received from Yorkshire, but action is at present suspended pending the result of an enquiry which is being held in that area by officers of this Ministry.      ;  .Public Meals Orders, 1917.-t-A report from the Manchester police says that these Orders are being vigorously enforced in that city: Three thousand visits have been made to public-eating.places ancLconsumption is well-within the permitted allowance.Dealings iri; Sugar ffiestnctitM) C^enilOlT-^A^repdrtthasrbeenDreeeived from which ife Appears; thi^ jvkry^eat; scale by a

Meantime certain features may- be indicated : 1. The stocks of many important commodities show a considerable improvement ,as compared-with,.those on August 1st, 1916.   This is markedly the case in grainstocks ancl to a less extent it is true of butter, cheese, and margarine. Meat stocks, &apos; however, when taken together show less improvement, those held at present being Jittle in excess of, those in August of 1916.  The * stock of . sugar has diminished- oncomparison, though it is higher now than in the earlier months of the summer.10&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;:. 2. Imports of. food-stuffs, with some exceptions, have been high during the past -few weeks. .Here,, also, cereals have been.most prominent.   This increase,,as/is shown Mn the tables, has compensated for the low importation in the,early season,of the year. ; - /&apos; 3.&apos; There has been a reduction in the. consumption of bread ,as compared with , 1916. .&apos;With the entry.into autumn a. rise in consumption, as compared with that ofthe summer must be anticipated.   The /relation between the - consumption&apos; in. thewinter of 1917-18 and that of 1916-17 will require to be watched carefully.Imports.      -k0 ........       u- -t4 &apos;-&apos;*----!.--r^&apos;x^ .The aggregate of principal foods imported ;last week (Table A) is lessthan in any of the previous six weeks, but only    per cent, below the average so far this, year, -&apos;&apos;and 22 per cent, above the&apos;corresponding week:last year.&apos; Tt is&apos; interestingr to. motice -that the aggregate for 1917 is now practically equal to the corresponding aggregate &apos; for 1916. &apos; j &apos; v,,-: r      ,    .. i :J w      ,    - -  .      , x -.r &apos; y^/fi      ; &apos; &apos; * Imports of Principal&apos;Foods,   &apos; .&apos;      ;tf;j,fr.Thousand Tons.Period.1917.1916.Excess, 191G. j .

In each case the amount was more than the average, for June or July in 1916 or 1917.   In London there was&apos;Ja considerable falling off in the weekending August 11th. - .......-.....-.....-..........Of fat cattle. (Table .C.) at. 51 markets the.,supply:. was. in. the first week of August 15 per cent.-less than in&apos;&apos;the: previous week,&quot; was nearly the same as the average for July 191,7, and 7 per *cent. above the supply in the first week of August 1916.

Averaging Irish, Danish, and Canadian baCon together we find that.the price is 130 per cent, above that in July 1914. This increase, however, is relatively less than that.of.

Comparison of the Movements of Wholesale and Retail Prices.Retail prices taken together have risen during the past three years by a smaller percentage than the corresponding wholesale prices, but there has been some tendency during the last 12 months.for such .an increase of retail&apos;prices as to increase the margin between wholesale and retail perhaps unduly.J? r.cenlage Increases.Article.July 1st, 1916,over JulyJLat, 1914.&quot;June 1916 over June 1914.August 1st, 1917, over July 1st, 1916.July 1917 over June 1916,Bread -   .FlourBeef : British  -Imported Mutton : BritishImportedSugar CheeseKetail. 46   r60 83 60 9.4 158 51Wholesale.-70 &quot;86 1236163 15448&apos;Retail. 3923 21 28 27 12 30Wholesale,31 20 17 1912 28*J ^se of bread the cost between the mill and the customer wasapproximatelv 2d., 2fdL, and 3K at the three dates, July 1914, July 1916 and August 1^^17 &apos;For sugar the margin between wholesale and jretail prices was - Sid - ffi and W I very great increase.
