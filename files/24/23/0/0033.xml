SPECIAL PARTY CONFERENCE.Central Hall, Westminster, Friday, August 10th, 1917.REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.Soon after the outbreak of War and the occupation of Brussels by the German troops the headquarters of the Internationalist Socialist Bureau was transferred to The Hague and a temporary Executive Committee formed by the co-option of a number of members of the Dutch Party Executive to the available members of the original Executive. This arrangement- was submitted to all the-affiliated Parties concerned, and was endorsed by the Party Executive at the time in common with a large majority of the affiliated sections of the I.S.B., and has continued throughout the War.In 1915 the I.S.B. Executive sought to secure interviews at The Hague with representatives of tbe various belligerent countries. In some cases success attended their efforts, but so far as Great Britain was concerned it was deemed prudent at that time that no representative should attend from this country. Towards the end of 1916 the I.S.B. Executive was also responsible for the holding of a Conference of representatives from the Parties of Neutral States.Early in the present year Hjalrnar Branting, the leader of the Swedish Socialist Party, in conjunction with other representatives of the Scandinavian Parties, secured the co-operation of the I.S.B. Executive in arranging con-sultations at Stockholm with delegates of the various nationalities engaged in the War. An invitation from the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee formed for this particular purpose was received by the various affiliated sections in this country in May last. This invitation was very carefully considered by the Party Executive in the light of the resolutions and discussions on the &quot; International &quot; at the Manchester Conference of the Party last January. It was ultimately decided that the invitation should not be accepted, but that an attempt should be made to convene a meeting of the Labour and Socialist Parties of the Allied Nations in London, preferably at the end of June, it being understood that the American Federation of Labour should be invited to participate. It was also agreed that all majority and minority sections of the Allied Parties should be invited, and that no resolutions of a binding character should be carried, but that differing policies should be discussed and placed on record. Within two or three days of this decision an announcement appeared that the Eussian Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Deputies the organisation representing the forces responsible for the Bussian devolution had decided to issue invitations to the Socialist and Labour Parties of all nations to a Conference with a view to securing the adoption of a general Working-Class Peace Policy. The Executive were unanimously of opinion, when this invitation was reported, that arrange-ments for the proposed Inter-Allied Conference should be suspended until further information regarding the Bussian proposal was forthcoming. A deputation was appointed to proceed to Petrograd for this purpose, and, if desirable, with permission to consult with Branting and his colleagues at

Stockholm. Owing to reasons with which delegates will be familiar, the official deputation (Messrs. G. H. Roberts, M.P., and W. Carter) did not proceed to Petrograd. The Executive Committee thereupon agreed, before deciding on any further action, to await the return of Mr. Henderson, who had proceeded to Petrograd at an earlier date on a Government mission. Mr. Henderson returned to London and arrived at the same time as four representatives of the Russian Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Deputies (Messrs. Roussanoff, Erlich, Smirnoff, and Goldenberg). Consultations witli the Party Executive were immediately arranged, and it was made abundantly clear by the Russian delegates that the proposed International Conference at Stockholm would be held whether the British Party decided to be represented or not, and that there were important reasons for it being convened without delay.The Party Executive also agreed that the Inter-Allied Conference should be proceeded with, recommended that it should be summoned by the British Section of the I.S.B. for August 8th and 9th, and that the present Special Party Conference should be called for the purpose of receiving a report of the Inter-Allied Conference and to decide whether the Party should be represented at the International Conference at Stockholm. The Executive agreed, by 5 votes to 2, to recommend to the Special Conference that the invitation should be accepted conditionally upon the gathering being of the nature of a consultation and that no binding resolutions should be adopted.The conditions governing the International Conference (Appendix I.) were as unsatisfactory to the French Socialist Party as to the Party Executive, and when the Executive met on July 25th an invitation was reported from the French Socialist Party for a deputation from the Executive to accompany the Russian delegates to Paris to examine the new invitation. Messrs. Henderson, Wardle, and MacDonald Were appointed for this purpose, and, in company with the Russian delegates, proceeded to Paris on July 27th. Consultations there took place upon the Russian invitation, with the result that a series of resolutions regarding the procedure of the Conference was decided upon and a recommendation made that it should be postponed until September 9th (Appendix II.). It was also decided that the Inter-Allied Conference, which the British Section of the I.S.B. had already summoned, should be postponed until August 28th and 29th. These changes have been endorsed by the Bi-itish Section and the Party Executive and the postpone-ment of the International Conference has been accepted by the Organising Bureau of the Conference. Under all these circumstances, however, it has been considered advisable for the present Special Conference to be held as originally proposed.The foregoing is a brief outline of the course of events leading up to the present Conference, and the decisions of the delegates upon the following resolutions are now invited :  Resolution I.&quot; That the invitation to the International Conference at Stockholm be accepted on condition that the Conference be consultative, and not mandatory.&quot;Resolution II.&quot;That the Party delegation consist of 24 representatives, the Executive to appoint eight, the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to be invited to appoint eight, and the present Special Conferente to appoint eight; this sectional representation to be equally reduced should circumstances necessitate.&quot;

Resolution III.&quot; That this Conference stands adjourned until Tuesday, August 21st, at 10-30 a.m.; that the Executive Committee&apos;s Report and the Draft Memorandum on War Issues be circulated to Affiliated Societies; that Amendments be received up to Friday, August 17th; and that the Memorandum and Amendments be the subject of discussion at the Adjourned Conference.&quot;APPENDIX I.INVITATION TO THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONFERENCE AT STOCKHOLM ON THE 15th AUGUST AND FOLLOWING DAYS.WORKERS  OF ALL  COUNTRIES!  UNITE!The War has been going on now for three years and we do not yet see the end of the conflict.It is the need to pave the way for this which has led the Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates to summon, under the flag of the Russian Revolution, an International Conference of the Socialist World.This proposal, which had been preceded by similar suggestions from many Socialist Parties, has been sanctioned by the All-Russia Congress of the Councils of Deputies. Its aim is to unite all the forces of the inter-national proletariat in order to obtain a peace without annexations or contributions, and based on the right of peoples freely to dispose of themselves.To enable it to succeed in its work the delegation of the Russian Councils has been assured of the effective collaboration of the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee, which has merged its plans in the Russian initiative, and which had already elucidated numerous questions by separate conferences with most of the Socialist Parties in order to prepare for the General Conference. It has created an Organising Bureau composed of delegates of the Russian and Dutch-Scandinavian Committees. This Bureau has decided, in order to avoid disputes, to respect as strictly as possible the procedure followed at the ordinary Congresses of the International as regards both admissions and the allocation of votes.The Delegation of the All-Russia Congress of Workmen&apos;s Deputies and the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee therefore invite to the General Confer-ence all the parties affiliated to the International Socialist Bureau; also those who, during the War. have been connected with the Berne Commission  majorities and minorities, as well as the oppositions which, in the course of recent events, have formed themselves into distinct Parties. They also invite the occupational organisations affiliated to the Trades Union Inter-national. The Congress will be held at Stockholm on August 15th and following days.The provisional programme of the Conference has been drawn up as follows: 1. The World War and the International.2. The Peace Programme and the International.3. The ways and means of realising this Programme and bringing the War rapidly to an end.

The organisers of the General Conference are deeply convinced that in order to bring about the end of the World War the International ought to induce all the Socialist Parties and all the Trade Union organisations to abandon any co-operation with Governments which refuse to indicate their War aims, or which have adopted Imperialist aims in an open or disguised manner and refused to renounce them.Convinced that your organisation also approves of these views, and that it is ready to undertake to put into practice without hesitation or deviation the resolutions of the General Conference conforming to these principles,&apos;1 the Delegation of the Russian Council and the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee beg you to take an active part in the International Socialist Conference and to send representatives.In the event of your organisation desiring to have placed on the Agenda any question which does not appear in the Programme of the Conference, a communication containing the proposal, accompanied by a report, ought to-be addressed to the Organising Bureau of the International Conference, Uplands-gatan, 14, Stockholm, and be in the hands of the Secretary before August, .5th.Socialist and fraternal greetings.For the Delegation of the Prussian Congress of Deputies of Soldiers and Workmen: H. EitLicn. N. Roussannoff.J. GoLDENBERG. A. SMIRNOFF.W. RoSANOFF.For the Secretariat : Camille Huysmans. Arthur Engberg.For the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee : P. J. Troelstra. H. H. Van Kol. J. W. Albarda. (Substitutes : W. H. Vliegen, F. M. Wibaut.)Stockholm, July 11th, 1917.Supplementary Declaration of the Russian Delegation : The Delegation of the All-Russian Congrass of the Councils of Work-men^ and Soldiers&apos; Deputies notes with regret that it has been unable to obtain the collaboration of the International Socialist Commission at Berne in the preliminary work of the General Conference.The Delegation believed that it was its duty to make sure of the assistance of the Commission, not only because it had strict instructions to do so, but also because all the active Socialist Parties in Russia are affiliated to the Zimmerwald Union.The participation of the Berne Commission in the preliminary work of the Conference appeared to the delegates especially necessary for another reason, that a considerable number of large Parties in Russia and abroad, affiliated to the Berne Commission, had already expressed a desire to take part.in the Conference proposed by the Council of Workmen and Soldiers.Hj. Branting. e. soderberg.G. MoLLER.F. I. BORGBJERG.(Substitute: Nina Bang.) J. Vidnes.

Be that as it may, the International Socialist Commission, composed for the moment of four members who are at Stockholm, has refused to take part in the preliminary work, without, however, refusing to give the Delegation technical assistance.The Zimmerwald Conference, where the question of participation at the General Conference will be considered, will be held five days before the meeting of the latter.APPENDIX II.REPORT OF MEETINGS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BRITISH LABOUR PARTY, THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE FRENCH SOCIALIST PARTY, AND DELEGATES OF THE RUSSIAN COUNCIL OF WORKMEN&apos;S AND SOLDIERS&apos; DEPUTIES.A meeting of the representatives of the British Labour Party (Messrs. Henderson, MacDonald, and Wardle), the Delegates of the Russian Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Deputies, and the Executive Committee (the &quot; C.A.P.&quot;) of the French Socialist Party, was held on Sunday, July 29th, 1917, at the offices of the latter (37, Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, Paris) to consider the conditions on which the British and French Socialist and Labour Movements would be prepared to attend the International Socialist Conference convened jointly by the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee and the Council of Workmen&apos;s arid Soldiers&apos; Deputies.M. Dubreuihl, the Secretary of the French Socialist Party, outlined the steps that had been taken since the question of holding a Conference had been raised by the Russians at the end of May, 1917. A prolonged discussion then took place on the constitution of such a Conference, especially on the point whether it was to be held strictly on the lines of the International Conferences formerly convened by the International Socialist Bureau, or whether it was to be an ad hoc meeting under its own rules.Mr. Wardle moved that a small sub-committee should be appointed to decide the basis of representation at the Stockholm Conference, its date, and place. This was carried, and a sub-committee was formed accordingly, consisting of Mr. Henderson and Mr. MacDonald; M. Longuet and M. Renaudel; M. Erlich and M. Goldenberg.The sub-committee met on Monday, July 30th, and decided to recom-mend to the full Conference the eight following resolutions :- (1)The meeting expresses its cordial approval of the initiative taken by the Soviet and supported by the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee, the result of which is the joint invitation of the two organisations to the working class of all nations to meet at an International Socialist and Labour Conference.&quot;(2)&quot; The organising bureau, consisting of the Russian delegation and the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee, with the technical assistance of the Secretariat of the International Socialist Bureau, is to have sole charge of all communications with the national sections for the purpose of the Conference.&quot;

(3)&quot; All bodies affiliated to the International shall be invited to take part-in the Conference.&quot;(4)&quot; Where, since the War, these bodies have been divided, the minorities as well as the majorities shall be invited in those cases where the minorities have formed themselves into separate Parties.(5)&quot; Trade Union organisations not affiliated to the I.S.B., but affiliated to the International Trade Union Bureau, shall be invited, provided that they are not already represented through organisations affiliated to the I.S.B.&quot;(6) .&quot; The invitations to each fraction of each national section shall be issued by the Organising Bureau, through the national sections of the International, and any appeal from the decisions of these sections shall be made to a Bureau to be elected, two representatives from each nation present, representing majority and minority, at the International Conference.&quot;(7)The future and the action of the International being dependent on the loyalty with which the resolutions passed by the Conference will be adhered to, the national sections who will take pai-t in the Conference hereby under-take, after the general decisions have been taken, to declare definitely at the meeting of the International what effect they intend to give to such decisions.&quot;(8)&quot; The sub-committee recommends that this meeting suggests to the organisers of the Conference that it should be held in Stockholm from September 9th to 16th. If there is any practical difficulty preventing this, the organisers should be requested to hold it in Christiania or elsewhere on the dates named.&quot;These resolutions were afterwards placed before a meeting of the British and Bussian delegates and the Committee of the French Party, and were earned.Discussion also took place on the agenda of the International Socialist Conference, with special reference to the statement contained in the official invitation, that the provisional programme was to consist of:  &quot;1. The World War and the International. 2. The Peace Programme and the International.3. The ways and means of realising this Programme and bringing the War rapidly to an end.&quot;The meeting adjourned soon after 9 p.m.

APPENDIX m.DRAFT MEMORANDUM ON WAR ISSUES PROPOSED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE INTER-ALLIED AND INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONFERENCES.The postponement until August 28th and 29th of the Conference of the Socialist and Labour Parties of the Allied Nations enables the Special Party Conference to consider what proposals should be submitted on behalf of the Labour Party. It will be remembered that at the Inter-Allied Confer-ence no proposal will be put to the vote unless unanimity can be secured, and that if, after consultation and discussion, unanimity cannot be reached the different statements will be simply recorded.The Executive Committee submits to the Special Party Conference the following draft of a statement which might, if the Special Party Conference approves, be laid before the Inter-Allied Conference on behalf of the Labour Party:-I.THE WAR,The Conference, in the name of the Socialist and Labour Parties of the nations now allied against the Governments of the Central European Powers, ratifies and reaffirms the declaration unanimously agreed to at the Confer-ence of the Socialist and Labour Parties of allied nations on February 14th, 1915, in the following terms This conference cannot ignore the profound general causes of the I European conflict, itself a monstrous product of the antagonisms which tear asunder capitalist society and of the policy of colonial dependencies and aggressive imperialism, against which international Socialism has never ceased to fight, and in which every Government has its share of responsibility.The invasion of Belgium and France by the German armies threatens the very existence of independent nationalities, and strikes a blow at all faith in treaties. In these circumstances a victory for Gennan imperialism would be the defeat and the destruction of democracy and liberty in Europe. The Socialists of Great Britain, Belgium, France, and Russia do not pursue the political and economic crushing of Germany; they are not at war with the peoples of Germany and Austria, but only with the Governments of those countries by which they are oppressed. They demand that Belgium shall be liberated and com-pensated. They desire that the question of Poland shall be settled in accordance with the wishes of the Polish people, either in the sense of autonomy in the midst of another State, or in that of complete inde-pendenee. They wish that throughout all Europe, from Alsace-Lorraine to the Balkans, those populations that have been annexed by force shall receive the right freely to dispose of themselves.While inflexibly resolved to fight until victory is achieved to accom-plish this task of liberation, the Socialists are none the less resolved to resist any attempt to transform this defensive war into a war of conquest, which would only prepare fresh conflicts, create new grievances, and subject various peoples more than ever to the double plague of armaments and war.Satisfied that they are remaining true to the principles of the International, the members of the conference express the hope that the

working classes of all the different countries will before long find them-selves united again in their struggle against militarism and capitalist imperialism. The victory of the Allied Powers must be a victory for popular liberty, for unity, independence, and autonomy of the nations in the peaceful federation of the United States of Europe and the world.II.THE PEACE.The War, which has become almost world-wide, bringing misery and desolation to nearly all nations, has now lasted for more than three years. It has already been the occasion of one great social revolution in the destruction of Czardom in Russia, on which the Conference most heartily congratulates the Russian people. It has united, in the defence of Democracy, the Old World and the New; and the Conference warmly welcomes the assistance to the cause of Human Freedom, in council no less than on the battlefield, that is now being afforded by the American people. So far as the Socialist and Labour Parties of the Allied Nations are concerned, it is against the ruthless Imperialism of autocratic Governments that the struggle is being waged. The Conference now, as on February 14th, 1915, asks the people of the several nations, and particularly their Socialist and Labour comrades in Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey, whether it is not possible for the united action of the working classes of the world to bring this monstrous conflict to a summary conclusion conformably to the principles of the International.III.THE RUSSIAN DECLARATION.The Conference cordially welcomes the Declaration of the Russian Government, in agreement with the Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates, that the only satisfactory basis of peace lies in the formula of &quot; No Annexations and No Indemnities; leaving to each people the freedom to settle its own destinies.&quot; The Conference repeats its determination to resist any attempt to transform this War into a War of Conquest, whether what is sought to be forcibly acquired is territory or wealth. The only readjustments of national boundaries or national citizenship of which the Conference can approve are those that may be arrived at by common agree-ment for the purpose of setting the several peoples free to settle their own destinies, or of removing some plain cause or excuse for another War. The Conference equally protests against any perpetuation of the War in the expectation of any Government being able to inflict on any nation whatever the crushing burden of an indemnity by way of punishment for having caused the War. The financial arrangements for the restoration of the ruined districts and the compensation for proved wrongdoing by any party to the War must be made as hereinafter indicated.IV,THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Of all the War aims, none is so important to the peoples of the world as that there should be henceforth on earth no more war. Whoever triumphs the world will have lost, unless some effective method of preventing war can be  found.    As  means  to this  end  the Conference relies very

largely upon the complete democratisation of all countries, including Germany and Austria-Hungary, which now cannot fail to place thein-selves in line with other civilised nations; on the frank abandonment of every form of &apos;&apos; Imperialism &quot;; on the suppression of secret diplomacy and the placing of foreign policy, just as much as homo policy, under the control of popularly elected legislatures; on the absolute responsibility of the Foreign Minister of each country to its legislature; on such concerted action as may be possible for the common limitation of the costly armaments by which all the peoples are burdened, and upon the entire abolition of profit-making armament firms, whose pecuniary interest lies always in war scares and rivalry in preparation for war. But the Conference demands, in addition, that it should be an essential condition of the Treaty of Peace itself that there should be forthwith established a Super-national Authority, or League of Nations, which should not only be adhered to by all the present belligerents, but which every other independent sovereign State in the world should be pressed to join; the immediate establishment by such League of Nations not only of*an International High Court for the settle-ment of all disputes between States that are of justiciable nature, but also of appropriate machinery for prompt and effective mediation between States in issues that are not justiciable; the formation of an International Legisla-ture in which the representatives of every civilised State would have their allotted share; the gradual development, as far as may prove to be possible, of International Legislation agreed to by and definitely binding upon the several States; and for a solemn agreement and pledge by all States that every issue between any two or more of them shall be submitted for settle-ment as aforesaid, and that they will all make common cause against any State which fails to adhere to this agreement.V.RESTORATION OF THE DEVASTATED AREAS.The Conference holds that one of the most imperative duties of all countries immediately Peace is declared will be the restoration, so far as may be possible, of the homes, farms, factories, public buildings, and means of communication in France, Belgium, the Tyrol and North Italy, East Prussia, Poland, Galicia, Russia, Roumania, and the other Balkan States, Armenia, and Asia Minor. Apart from Belgium, which has already been referred to, the Conference holds that the restoration of these devastated areas should be undertaken at the expense of an International Fund, to which all the belligerent Governments should be required to contribute in pro-portions to be agreed upon, having regard among other things to their several responsibilities and participation in the damage; that the restoration should not be limited to compensation for public buildings, capitalist undertakings, and material property proved to be destroyed or damaged, but should be extended to setting up the wage-earners themselves in homes and employ-ment; and that to ensure the full and impartial application of these principles the assessment and distribution of the compensation, so far as the cost is contributed by the International Fund, should be made under the direction of an International Commission.VI.INQUIRY INTO WRONGDOING.The Conference welcomes the fact that public feeling will not be satisfied unless a full and free judicial investigation into the accusations so freely

made on all sides that particular Governments have ordered, and particui officers have exercised, acts of cruelty, oppression, violence, and theft again individual victims, for which no justification can be found in the ordim usages of war.   The Conference draws attention, in particular, to the lo; of life and property, of merchant seamen and other non-combatants (ii eluding women and children), resulting from the inhuman and ruthle; conduct of the submarine warfare.   The Conference recommends that should be part of the conditions of Peace that there should be forthwith st up a Court of Claims and Accusations, which should investigate all sue; allegations as may be brought before it, summon the accused person Government to answer the complaint, to pronounce judgment, and awar compensation or damages, payable by the individual or Government cor demned, to the persons who had suffered wrong, or to their heirs.VII. BELGIUM.The Conference once more declares that the foremost condition of Pea&apos; must be the reparation by the German Government of the wrong admittedi done to Belgium; payment for all the damage that has resulted from tlii wrong; and the restoration of Belgium to complete and untrammeled hide pendent sovereignty, leaving to the decision of the Belgian people t\v determination of their own future policy in all respects.VIII. THE BALKANS.The Conference insists on the restoration to then: several peoples c the territories of Serbia and Montenegro.  It suggests that the whole problei of the reorganisation of the administration of the peoples of the Baikal peninsula might be dealt with by a Special Conference of their represents-fives, or by an authoritative International Commission, on the basis of (n the complete freedom of these people to settle their own  destinii-irrespective of Austrian, Turkish, or other foreign dominion; (6) the hut pendent sovereignties of the several nationalities in those districts in whici these are largely predominant; (c) the universal adoption of religion-tolerance, the equal citizenship of all races, and local autonomy; (d) Customs Union embracing the whole of the Balkan States; and (e) the entr of all the Balkan National States into a Federation for the concert arrangement by mutual agreement among themselves of all matters common concern.IX.ALSACE   AND   LORRAINE.The Conference reaffirms its reprobation of the crime against the pear-of the world by which Alsace and Lorraine were forcibly torn-from France k 1871, a political blunder the effects of which have contributed in no small degree to the continuance of unrest and the growth of militarism in Europt-and the Conference profoundly sympathising with the unfortunai inhabitants of Alsace and Lorraine who have been subjected to so mucl repression, asks that they shall be allowed to satisfy their inflexible desn-for restoration to the French Republic.

X. IITALY. 11The Conference declares its warmest sympathy with the people Italian race and speech who have been left outside the inconvenient ancl indefensible boundaries that have, as a result of the diplomatic agreement?! of the past, been assigned to the kingdom of Italy, and supports their clainl to be united with those of their own race and tongue.  The Conference recoql nises the necessity for securing the legitimate interests of the people o: Italy in the Adriatic and JEgean, without precluding a like recognition of tlx claims of other peoples, upon the basis of an agreement securing the safeh and welfare of them all.XLPOLAND, Etc.With regard to the other cases in dispute, from Luxembourg on the ono hand, of which the independence has been temporarily destroyed, to the lands now under foreign domination inhabited by other races the out standing example being that of the Poles the Conference relies as the onl; way of achieving a lasting settlement on the application of the principle oi allowing each people to settle its own destiny.XII.THE JEWS AND PALESTINE.The Conference demands for the Jews of all countries the same elementary rights of tolerance, freedom of residence and trade, and equal citizenship that ought to be extended to all the inhabitants of every nation. But the Conference further expresses the hope that it may be practicable by agreement among all the nations to set free Palestine from the harsh and oppressive government of the Turk, in order that this country may form a Free State under international guarantee, to which such of the Jewish people as desire to do so may return, and may work out their own salvation free from interference by those of alien race or religion.XIII.THE PROBLEM OF THE TURKISH EMPIRE.The Conference realises that the whole civilised world condemns the handing back to the universally execrated rule of the Turkish Government any subject people which has once been freed from it. Thus, whatever may be proposed with regard to Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia, they cannot be restored to the tyranny of the Sultan and his Pashas. The Conference disclaims all sympathy with the Imperialist aims of Governments and capitalists, who would make of these and other territories now dominated by the Turkish hordes merely instruments either of exploitation or militarism. If in these territories it is impracticable to leave it to the peoples to settle their own destinies the Conference suggests that they should be dealt with in the same way as the Colonies of Tropical Africa, and placed for administra-tion in the hands of a Commission acting under the Supernational Authority or League of Nations. The Conference further suggests that the peace of the world requires that Constantinople should be made a free port, permanently

neutralised and placed (together with both shores of the Dardanelles ai possibly some or all of Asia Minor) under the same impartial administrateXIV.THE COLONIES OF TROPICAL AFRICA.With regard to the Colonies of the several belligerents in Tro])] Africa, from sea to sea (North of the Zambesi River and south of the Sahai Desert), the Conference disclaims all sympathy with the Imperialist id that these should form the booty of any nation, should be exploited for tli profit of the capitalist, or used for the promotion of the militarist aims Governments.   In view of the fact that it is impracticable here to leave t! various peoples concerned to settle their own destinies, the Confereno suggests that the interests of Humanity would be best served by the fu and frank abandonment by all the belligerents of any dreams of an Africa Empire; the transfer of all the present Colonies of the European Powers Tropical Africa, together with the nominally independent Republic of Liber to the proposed Supemational Authority or League of Nations here suggested; and their administration by an impartial Commission under tli. Authority with its own trained staff, as a single independent African Stat on the principles of (1) the Open Door and Equal Freedom of Enterprise the traders of all nations; (2) Protection of the natives against exploitali&apos; and oppression and the preservation of their tribal interests; (3) all revem raised to be expended for the welfare and dvelopment of the African St;i itself; and (4) the permanent neutralisation of this African State and abstention from participation in international rivalries or any future wars.XV.SUPPLIES AFTER THE WAR.That, in view of the probable world-wide shortage, after the War, exportable foodstuffs and raw materials, and of merchant shipping, it imperative, in order to prevent the most serious hardships, and even possii famine, in one country or another, that systematic arrangements should made on an international basis, for the allocation and conveyance of tl available exportable surpluses of these commodities to the different countri in proportion, not to their purchasing powers, but to their several pressii needs; and that, within each country, the Government must for some tic maintain its control of the most indispensable commodities, in order i secure their appropriation not in a competitive market mainly to the rich&apos; classes in proportion to their means, but, systematically, to meet the mo urgent needs of the whole community on the principle of &quot; no cake &apos; anyone until all have bread.&quot;XVI.THE PREVENTION OF UNEMPLOYMENT.The Conference cannot but anticipate that, in all countries withoi exception, the dislocation of industry attendant on Peace, the instant di charge of millions of munition makers and workers in war trades, and t&apos; demobilisation of millions of soldiers in face of the scarcity of industr: capital and the insecurity of commercial enterprise will, unless prompt ai energetic action be taken by the several Governments, plunge a large part 1

the wage-earning population into all the miseries of Unemployment mo or less prolonged. In view of the fact that widespread Unemployment any country, like a famine, is an injury not to that country1 alone, I impoverishes also the rest of the world, the Conference holds that it is t duty of every Government to take immediate action, not merely to relit.-the Unemployed, when Unemployment has set in, but actually, so far may be practicable, to prevent the occurrence of Unemployment. T. Conference, therefore, urges upon the Socialist and Labour Parties of eve: country the necessity of their pressing upon their Governments the pi paration of plans for the execution of all the innumerable public works (su; as the making and repairing of roads and railways, the erection of schoc and public buildings, the provision of working-class dwellings, and t: reclamation and afforestation of land) that will be required in the near futui not for the sake of finding measures of relief for the Unemployed, but win view to these works being undertaken at such a rate in each locality as w suffice, together with the various capitalist enterprises that may be in pi gress, to maintain at a fairly uniform level year by year, and throughout ea year, the aggregate demand for labour, and thus prevent there being a: Unemployed. It is now known that in this way it is quite possible for a: Government to prevent, if it chooses, the very occurrence of any widespre or prolonged involuntary Unemployment; which if this is now in any count allowed to occur, is as much the result of Government neglect as is at epidemic disease.XVII.ECONOMIC RELATIONS.The Conference declares against all the projects now being prepared I Imperialists and capitalists, not in any one country only, but in practical all countries, for an Economic War after Peace has been secured, eitli against one or other foreign nation or against all foreign nations. Su an Economic War, if begun by any country, would inevitably lead ; reprisals, to which each nation in turn might in self-defence be driven. 1 Conference realises that all such attempts at economic aggression, whet! by Protective Tariffs or capitalist trusts or monopolies, inevitably result the spoliation of the working classes of the several countries for the pro! of the capitalists; and the Conference sees in the alliance between u Military Imperialists and the Fiscal Protectionists in any country whatsoeu not only a serious danger to the prosperity of the masses of the people, h also a grave menace to Peace. On the other hand, the right of each natic to the defence of its own economic interests cannot be denied. The Cos ference accordingly urges upon the Socialist and Labour Parties of a countries the importance of insisting, in the attitude of the Governmei. towards commercial enterprise, on the principle of the open door, on Custoif Duties being limited strictly to revenue purposes, and on there being t hostile discrimination against foreign countries. But the Conference ui? equally the importance of the utmost possible development by appropria: Government action of the resources of every country for the benefit not ore of its own people but also of the world, and the need for an internatioi-agreement for the enforcement in all countries of the legislation on facto: conditions, hours of labour, and the prevention of &quot;sweating&quot; and unhealtb trades necessary to protect the workers against exploitation and oppression

THE   SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL.The Conference declares that the proposals made for the security ci Peace in this Memorandum will be made more secure if the Socialist Inter-national is reconstituted so that it may discuss and deal with more effectively than hitherto all questions of international importance, and thus enable the Socialist and Labour Parties in each nation to take co-operative action in their National Parliaments to achieve common and agreed ends.XIX.THE BASIS OF AGREEMENT.The Conference holds that agreement among the warring Governments can be secured only by a free and frank discussion of each other&apos;s claims and desires; it deplores the reticence and secrecy in which the diplomatists cloak their respective aims; and it calls upon the Socialist and Labour Parties in the several countries now at war to press for the earliest possible exchange of views and the most considerate treatment of each other&apos;s prepossessions, in the confident belief that, by a common repudiation and abandonment of imperialism and aggression, the present terrible calamity may pass, and may issue in a World made safe for that complete Democracy in which lies the only hope of the people.
