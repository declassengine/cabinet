eve7121/*Transport/S65WAR CABINETTrain Ferries. iiA^k^^ Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I forward a note on the present position as regards train ferries.DERBY.17th August, 1917.Three steamerB are under construction. 2 byMessrs. Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Co., and 1 by The  airfield Shipbuilding Co.   .Satisfactory progress is being made, and the first of Armstrong Whitworth1s was launched a week ago, the second will be launched in 3 or 4 weeks, and the steamer building by Fairfield will be launched in about a week*s time.As regards Terminals, those on this side at Riohborough and Southampton are well advanced, and will be ready before the necessary bridge work is delivered.As regards the French Termini, Dunkirk, Calais, and Dieppe, The Chief Engineer Port Construction reports all work as being well forward.Some delay has occurred in connection with the construction of the 5.loading bridges, the orders for which were placed with Messrs. Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Co.     They will b* . completed at the Yards between the 31st. of August and the 22nd &apos; September, and will then take from a moith to six weeks to erect.,The delay in this connection is said by, Messrs. Armstrong to be partly due to the intervention of&apos; the holidays during^July and August, a fortnight in Scotland being &apos; immediately followed by a week in England,,but there was also considerable delay in getting delivery,of the steel required.Therefore, although;the steamers and terminals will be ready, the bridges will be delayed, and, the service will not start as early.as was at first anticipated^ but it is expected that the first ferry will commence running about the 1st Of November.     All tho necessary.arrangements for the traffic operating of. these ferries are well in hand and have been thoroughly discussed with the various ITar Office Departments concerned.,&apos;-. -----it Is anticipated that the steamer between -Richborough,and Calais will make one round trip per day; and between Southampton and Dieppe one round trip per day and ahalf.-  .- .        :
