SECRETIntelligence Bureau,378Department of Information. BA\7/013.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary.   XIII.The attempts of Dr. von Seidler to reconstruct his Cabinet on a parliamentary basis seem to be further from success than ever. LVen the German parties are by no means unanimous in their support. For instance, the Christian Socialist party passed a resolution to the effect that it v/ould vote all measures necessary to the State, but that it would not enter the government * because &quot;the basis for an entry does not exist&quot;.     The Prime Minister after&quot; this continued his negotiations with the Czech socialist leader, Smeral, and Mr. Lazarski, the President of the Polish Club, but without success. The apparent quarrel between Czechs and Jugo-Slavs which was summarised in last week&apos;s report was welcomed with paeans of joy by the whole German press of Austria as a sign that the Slav bloc was breaking up; but it soon became apparent that this was untrue. The leading Slovene newspaper formally announced that the differences between the two races were a mere question of tactics, not of principle, and scoffed at the Germans for thinking that they could break up the bloc.     Its restatement of policy - which the official Premdenblatt thought sufficiently important to reproduce - defined the &quot;minimum demand of the Slovenes&quot; as &quot;a free and united Southern Slav State under the Habsburg sceptre&quot; on the basis of the Reichsrat declarations of the 30th May.     It then added, &quot;we no longer feel ourselves to be merely Slovenes but an essential part of the Southern Slav race: and this not as dreamers but as Realpolitiker who know what they want&quot;.     The Slovene clerical leader, Dr. Krek, also published an outspoken article to the effect that &quot;to-day we must make our own history&quot;.
The meaning of all this soon became apparent-     On August 7th Father Korosec, in the name of the Jugo-Slav Parliamentary Club, definitely declined to support any government which was not willing to accept the Jugo-Slav programme, and categorically denied the rumours Qf a breach bettreen Czechs and Jugo-Slavs.     He also demanded the restoration of constitutional government in Bosnia. Thus the Slav bloc iB not dead after all, and Seidler!s schemes for a parliamentary government seem to have failed at any rate for the time.Croatia for Southern Slav Unity. Meanwhile incidents in the Croatian: Parliament have revived the ever-latent friction between Agram and Budapest.When Count Tisza fell last May, Baron Skerlecz, the Ban of Croatia, resigned with him.    At first the Hungarian Clerical leader, Count Aladar Zichy, was made Minister for Croatia by Count Esterhazy, and there was a determined clerical intrigue to give the cold shoulder to the Serbo-Croat coalition which forms the Parliamentary majority in Croatia and to reinstate as Ban the notorious ex-Dictator, Baron Rauch.     After a long struggle,^ however, Count Esterhazy came to terms with the Serbo-Croat coalition, and made one of its most conservative members, Mr. Mihalovic, a large land-owner in Slavonia, Ban, promising also to replace Count Zichy by a Croat.     On 12th July the Croatian parliament,met and the new Ban put forward a programme of &quot;demooratisation as the foundation of a larger and happier national future&quot; and promised universal suffrage, liberty of the press, freedom of association and assembly,and independence of the Bench. The majority, in supporting him, has adopted a frankly opportunist policy.     Having been thss promised all the main reforms in in-ternal policy for which it has been agitating for years it calculates that it is wiser to pay lip service to the existing constitutional arrangement between Hungary and Croatia, and to await events in
foreign policy, which may bring a realisation of its full ideals, gut a hint of the true feeling is given by a small incident on the opening day.     A supporter of the new government was describing it a appointment as &quot;a great success&quot; when an opposition deputy finished his sentence for him with the words &quot;of the Russian Revolution&quot;.     &quot;When the Russians are more ready there will be more success.&quot;    On 4th August the peasant leader, Mr. Radich, in a speech of two hours, put forward a programme of complete unity and independence for the Croats, declared that national unity could not stop short at the Brave and the Danube, in other words that Croatia and Serbia must come together - and ended by demanding the immediate ejection of all Magyar officials from Croatia and the closing of Magyar schools in Croatia.    The Vice-President of the Diet, as in duty bound, made a formal protest against such claims as incompatible with the Hungaro-Croatian compromise, as they of course are in fact.    But the Hungarian press is not satisfied with this - naturally enough, in view of the fact that the very same man himself made a very daring speech in favour of national unity not much over a year ago.     The semi-official Pester Lloyd devotes a whole page to what it calls &quot;Southern Slav Orgies&quot;, and demands that the Hungarian Premier should take a very strong line against such scandals.     The Budapesti Hirlap (now In close touch with Tisza) on the eve of Radich&apos;s speech devoted its two front pages to a still more violent attack on the Croats.   It is interesting to find this ablest journalistic ex-ponentr of the anti-Croat thesis writing as follows: &quot;To-day the Jugo-Slav empire is still a dream, but the dream of millions of men among the Jugo-Slav population.    The Jugo-Slavs inside the Monarchy preach the realisation of the national Jugo-Slav ideal, always adding that they desire it under the sceptre of the Habsburgs.     Outside the frontiers of the Monarchy the Jugo-Slavs talk differently and wish to make the Jugo-Slav State free and
independent even of the Eabsburg sceptre.&quot;    This from an open enemy is valuable testimony.     All this had occurred before the Pact of Corfu &quot;feetween the Serbian government and the Jugo-Slav Committee could have become known in Croatia or Hungary.     It will undoubtedly reverberate throughout the Southern Slav world.Aa Ujsag (tisza!s organ) announces the impending resignation of the Hungarian Premier owing to ill-health and internal dissensions in the Cabinet.     It is not impossible that the Croatian difficulty has something to do with this rumour, which is still unconfirmed.The Viennese Press on Mr. Balfour&apos;3 Speech-of July 50 and*tO*-fc***Mi -- **********m*w**.********mm**-m      WKi-mm      *m mm - mm * ^m^m^mv*mmmmm*mm^m*mm****mmmm^^m*****w^mmmmmaMMMMthe Prime Minister&apos; s Speech of Ay.gy.ot 4.     The very elaborate Austrian and Hungarian comments on the speech of Lord Robert Cecil -summarised in a special Memorandum X. - have been followed up by equally elaborate comments on the later speeches of Mr. Balfour and Mr. Lloyd George.     Those of the official ffiomflfinblatt are colourless and merely amount to rather formal expressions of loyalty to the Gorman Alliance.     There are, however, a whole series of nervous outbursts in the ffoue Preie Presse which are distinctly interesting.     On 1st August H. Ribofs policy is compared to that of Louis XIV and Hapoleon III and Mr. Kerenaky is denounced as worse than the Tsar.     &quot;He returns to Milyukov, to the despised persons who sat in the Duma and were swept away by the Revolution.&quot;    The evening edition of the same day deals at great length with the speech of Mr. Balfour, whose aim is assumed &quot;to overthrow or influence the internal policy of the Monarchy&quot;.     &quot;As is natural with a statesman of polished form there is no trace of the brutalities and frivolity of Lloyd George.    The other nationalities (the paper laments in a mood of frank confession which is extremely significant in that particular quarter) have got so strong as to upset a powerful Cabinet (i.e. Clam-Martinic) and drive the Germans on to the defensive; but the Monarchy will none the less never
tolerate foreign interference.     Mr. Balfour&apos;s remarks about the nationalities are &quot;very cool and condescending, as from one who does not wholly reject certain- suggestions from emigre sources&quot;. He is said to ignore Russia, Serbia, the Balkans and Rumania &quot;in away characteristic of the author of the book on scepticism&quot;. His remarks on Alsace are treated as the kernel of the speech, and what he says of Germany is the more important because it comes from &quot;one of the fetf Englishmen who know Germany&quot;.     Altogether the paper draws from the speech the impression of &quot;a certain ringing-off of imperialistic policy&quot;.Next day in a fresh leader the Keue Freie Presse   quotes &quot;the leader of the group of independent peace&quot;&apos;friends&quot;(Mr. Snowden) as speaking of &quot;the possibility of a French revolution&quot;, and emphasises the importance of such an &quot;admission&quot; from &quot;a serious man whose life has been threatened owing to his opinions and who does not throw out remarks thoughtlessly&quot;.     France, we are told, really cares much less atsout Alsace than about destroying German unity.Mr. Balfourfs speech is dealt with as containing far more than appears on the surface.     It is quite noticeable that he is &quot;a doubter who^defends outwardly a policy in which inwardly he does not believe&quot;: for he is far too acute and refined &quot;not to see through the absurditiee in the policy of Lloyd George and Bonar Law&quot; Thus the general impression is that he is not in agreement with the policy of his own country, but that he could not speak otherwise in the middle of the great Flanders battle.    The real importance of the speech would become evident if the British offensive should fail.     One other phrase is of interest:-   &quot;Sonnino is in London and Balfour seems to have forgotten that Italy is in the world.&quot;On 6th August the Neue Freie Presse devotes another long leader to the Prime Ministers Queenfe Hall speech.    Beginning with the phrase &quot;Lloyd George is a political swashbuckler&quot;, it elaborates still further the theory that there is a divergence of views on
war policy inside the British Cabinet.     It treats the acceptance of indemnification of territory ae &quot;the Caudine Fork which we could never adcept&quot;.     This leader is remarkable for the amazing lie that &quot;there would have been peace if England had not joined the war, peace, which was only bfoken because, Lord Grey in a telegram to Paeic promisedJSngland13 support&quot;.    Heedless to say no attempt is made to prove this assertion.The more honest and independent Zeit had an entire leader confiscated probably dealing, on less clap-trap lines, with the same subject, as I can find no commentary on the speech elsewhere in that paper.    The clerical Reichspost, on the other hand, has some very interesting remarks under the title &quot;The First Dove?&quot;. It treats Mr. Balfou^s speech as deliberately vague and proving his desire to say neither too much nor too little, and then claims that if Mr. Balfour is right in not defining war aims further, then Mr. Lloyd George must be wrong in blaming Dr. Michael!s for doing the same.     It praises Mr. Balfour&apos;s remarks on Austria-Hungary aa containing &quot;nothing insulting, nothing even which we ourselves do not want&quot;, and interprests him as meaning that Auatro-Hungarian questions cannot come up at the Peace Conference.    Mr. Balfour, it adds, is &quot;clearly opposed to those who wanted to force on Germany and her allies a fight for their existence   These comments deserve attention, in view of their source: for the Reichspost,   which wae the organ of the la e Archduke Francis Ferdinand, ie still in fairly close touch with his nephew, the present $mperor, and still more with the highest ecolesiastical and military circles In Auetria.On 6th August the same paper deals with Mr. 140yd George&apos;e speech, which &quot;means a bad relapse into insulting rancour and malicious passion&quot;.    By its &quot;orgy of wickedness and ^iate it destroys all the effect of previous British speeches&apos;. &apos; The Releas-Eost adds that it is painful to assume that &quot;the words of the Prime Minister weigh more than those of the Foreign Minister&quot;.
Magyar Press Comment.      The comments of the Hungarian press are on the whole more commonpla6e.     The Pester Lloyd says of Mr. Balfour that &quot;those v/ho know this trained dialectician of old will hardly recognise him &quot;and treats him as pouring water into his wine by his avoidance of all talk about the destruction of Germany. It also connects Sir Edward Carson!s reference to the left bank of the Rhine with the German Chancellor^ revelations regarding M. Ribot.While the party organ of Count Karolyi treats Mr. Balfour^ speech as a clear proof that &quot;Peace is on the march&quot;, the radical and clerical papers also welcome it as a hopeful sign.     Count Andrassy!e organ is polite to Mr. Balfour but rages against the &quot;infamous&quot; M. Ribot.    Az Ujsag, the liberal organ of best standing in Hungary, contemptuously classes &quot;Balfour, Asquith, Cecil and the others&quot; all together and says that Czernin and Michaelis have already given fche proper answer to these boring fellows * but the most outstanding expression of opinion is an article of Count Tisza himself which he characteristically publishes in the most rabidly Jingo paper in Hungary, the Budapesti Hirlap.    He draws three special conclusions from Mr. Balfourls speech - (if that England in-Eends to retain complete freedom to annex the German colonies; (2) that &quot;tyrannous, oppressive, barbarous Germany&quot;is invited to rise to the level of Great Britain; and (3) that &quot;liberation&quot; in the mouth of Entente politicians means support for those races which have been guilty of treason and &quot;such a transformation of the Monarchy as would secure the leading r^le to the 3Shtente!s humble servants?.     He argues that such a speech would be impossible but for the indifference and ignorance of the British public in regard to European politics, and ascribes the er-t.ire responsibility for the war against the peace-loving Central Powers to Pan-Slav ambitions, French revanche and English economic
P^reed. His whole tone strongly suggests eagerness to cover up his own very great responsibility for provoking the war.R.W.S.W.18/8/17.
