hiSECRET .G.S., Salonika, No, 545/17. G.Chief of the Imperial General Staff, . War Office, London, S.W.I enclose a Summary of information concerning the allied forces on this front for the month of July, together with a sketch map showing approximate dispositions of all troops in this theatre.G .H .Q, a ,Salonika, 1st August, 1917..(Sd.)   GEO. F. MILNE,Lieutenant-Genera1, C ommand ing-in-Chief, British Salonika Force.
British Force.The scope of operations during the month has continued to he limited to patrol encounters, local raids, artillery and aerial action.Amongst the numerous minor operations which have been of almost daily occurrence, the most important and successful was a raid undertaken by the 1st Royal Scots together with 2 companies Scottish Horse, one squadron Yeomanry, 2 sections llth Battery R.F.A., and one aeroplane^ for the purpose of raiding the village of Homondos in the Struma valley.     The operation was successfully carried out and one wounded officer and 33 other ranks (Bulgars) were captured as well as a small quantity of war material. Two mountain guns were found but, as it was not possible to remove them, the sights were taken away and the guns otherwise damaged.      Our casualties were very slight. The enemy&apos;s killed are estimated at about 60.Of the two detachments mentioned in my last summary of operations, which were sent to Old Greece to co-operate with the French, the one composed of 500 all ranks 4th Rifle Brigade has returned.      The other, composed of 500 all ranks 2nd East Yorkshire Regiment is due to arrive here on August 1st.        While in Thessaly it suffered somewhat from malaria and dysentry.Owing to the lack of experience shown by the 228th Infantry Brigade when holding the extended line from Lozista to Dova Tepe, I have replaced it in the line by a regular brigade, and it is now undergoing a course of training as a front line unit so far as the age and physical condition of the men will allow.ExceptSECRET.SUMMARY   OF   OPERATIONS OF   ALLIED   FORCES   SALONIKA     -     JULY   1917.
Except for reliefs within divisions, no other alteration in the distribution of the force has taken plaoe; every opportunity is being taken to train such troops as it is possible to withdraw from the front. Aviation.Owing to favourable conditions for aerial operations-, our machines have almost daily carried out bombing raids, causing considerable damage to enemy dimps, encampments, and railheads, notably at Angista, Demirhissar, and Puljovo with the loss of only one of our machines. The average number of machines engaged on these raids has been seven. Since the beginning of the month over 15 tons of high explosive bombs have been dropped.    Petrol bombs have also been employed with effect for the purpose of burning enemy crops.On the 13th a hostile aeroplane was brought downnear Angista. Other Forces.Of the French troops sent to Thessaly and Corinth last month, the following changes have taken place:-The 40th Infantry Regiment and 58th Infantry Regiment both of the 30th Division (Group of General Regnault) are moving north from Athens.Two regiments of Chasseurs dfAfrique (1st and 4th), of the group of General Venel, are moving north from Thessaly.     The command of this group was taken over by General Sarda during the second week in July.The positions of the other forces remainunchanged. General.The health of the army, as compared with that of last year, has been most satisfactory.      In only onedivision/
G .H m.0, .  ySalonika.1st, August, 19.17..division on the Doiran front has there been an abnormal increase in malaria.     In spite of the fact that many of the malaria cases are recurrent from last year the daily nick rate in July was only 3.09 per thousand as compared to 4.7 for the same period last year. The mostsatisfactory indication of the success of the preventativo measures taken is that the actual malaria attacks are of a much slighter nature, as is shown by the fact that the death rate due to fever has fallen from .7 to .13.
