(b) If the working of the invention within the UnitedKingdom on a commercial scale is heing prevented or hindered hy the . importation from ahroad of the patented article hy the patentee or those claiming under him, or hy other persons against whom the 5 patentee is not taking or has not taken any proceedings for infringement:(c) If the demand for the patented article in the UnitedKingdom is not heing  met to an adequate extent and on reasonable terms : 10(d) If, by reason of the refusal of the patentee to grant alicence or licences upon reasonable terms, the trade or industry of the United Kingdom or the trade of any person or class of persons trading in the United Kingdom, or the establishment of any new trade or 15 industry in the United Kingdom, is unfairly pre-judiced, and it is in the public interest that a licence , or licences should be granted : ,  ,(e) If any trade or industry in the United Kingdom, or anyperson or class of persons engaged therein, is unfairly 20 prejudiced by the conditions attached by the patentee, whether before or after the passing of this Act, to the purchase, hire, or use of the patented article, or to the using or working of the patented process:Provided that for the purpose of determining whether there 25 has been any abuse of the monopoly rights under a patent, it shall be taken that patents for hew inventions are granted not only to encourage invention but to secure that new inventions shall if possible be worked on a commercial scale in the United Kingdom without undue delay. 3q(3) On being satisfied that the allegations of any petition under this section are proved, the comptroller may exercise any of the following powers as he may deem expedient in the circumstances:     ,(a) He may order the patent to be indorsed with the words 35 &quot;licences of right&quot; and thereupon the same rules shall apply as are provided in this Act in respect of patents so indorsed, and an exercise by the comptroller of this power shall entitle every existing licensee to surrender his licence in exchange for a licence to 40 be settled by the comptroller in like manner as if

PATENTS AW DESIGNS * &apos;Explanatory Memorandum by the Board of TradeonPatents and Designs BilJU
PATENTS AND DESIGNS BILL.The experience which the Board&quot; of Trade has gained in administering the Patents, Designs, and Trade Maries (Temporary Rules) Acts, 1914, under which licences are granted to work enemy-owned patents and designs and permission given to use one my-owned, trade marks lias led the Soard to consider in what respects it is desirable to amend the law relating to patents and designs.The object of granting patents for new inventions is to benefit the trade or industry of the United Kingdom, lor this purpose it is not enough to reward the inventor; it is also necesaary to secure that new inventions be brought into commercial use without undue delay.    To bring a new invention into commercial use requires in many cases the co-operation of the capitalist, and the readiosr way of securing this co-operation is a grant of a monopoly.    A monopoly being contrary to common right can only be iusti-fied by some consideration moving to the public.    The con-sideration justifying the grant of a monopoly for a new invention is not only the disclosures to the public of in-formation   which they can use when the period of the monopoly expires, but the benefit to trade by the new in-vention being brought into commercial use during that period.    The public therefore are entitled to nave the monopoly so framed and guarded that they are not deprived of this consideration,,    The real difficulty is to prevent the abuse of the patent monopoly without so restricting it as to deter the capitalist from financing the inventor.There are therefore various conflicting interests to be considered.    The inventor has to be rewarded and encouraged to exercise his inventive skill.    The financier has to be induced to assist the inventor&apos;in bringing his invention into practical use, and lastly, the pu lie have to be protected from the abuse of the monopoly and the loss of the consideration which alone justifies the grant.    The last consideration applies especially in the case of foreign patentees, where it is particularly necessary that the monopoly given by the Crown in the public interest should not be ivto tne detriment of national trade or national interests%The cmef abuse of the patent monopoly may be summarised as follows(l) Preventing the use within the Realm of the patented invention from ulterior motives.(2) Using the patent monopoly to&quot;encourage trade abroad and to hinder trade in the Realm.(3) Hindering the trade in the Realm by unfairly refusing to grant licences.Clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill are an attempt to deal with the whole question and provide a complete and comprehensive scheme for the purpose of both encouraging early manufacture within the Realm and of preventing abuse of the patent mono-poly.   As rflgftrda fllaaaa ,1, -the procedure under Section 24 of the Patents and Designs Act  1907, has been found cumbrous and expensive and 1-as been rarely used;   and as regards Section 27 the standard of comparison l&amp;etween British and -Foreign
manufacture was one which it has been found difficult to work out in practice, as the&quot;*necessary data was not available. Further there &quot;ire cases where the appropriate penalty is re-vocation, others where the appropriate remedy is a compulsory licence and there would zeem to be no reason for not allowirg the Tribunal to order either remedy in its discretion.   It is therefore proposed in Clause 1 to replace both the sections re-ferred to by a single clause amalgamating the procedure as far as possible for dealing with all future abuses.   It must be borne in mind that inventions may be divided roughly into two cfesses, namely, those which do and those which do not reauirev for their practical development the expenditure of considerable capital.   In the case of some inventions capital to the extent of over  100,000 has been expended before any return has been received by  he owners of the patents.   On the other hand there are many inventions which needbut little capital to procure their commercial use.   The ne^ sections are so framed that adequate discrimination in this respect can be exercised by the tribunal in determining whether in any particular case there has been an abuse of the patent monopoly.   Experience has shewn that it is not the case tnab revocation of a patent in the case of abuse of a patent monopoly is always or even most frequently the best course to adopt ?n the interests of the Realm,   xhere are no doubt cases in which the only punishment for the abuse? of the patent monopoly should be revocation, but in the majorit; of cases the best interests of the country will probably be served by making the grant of compulsory licences the punishinen&apos; for abuses of the monopoly,   It would frequently be to the ad-vantage of a foreigner that a patent - even his own patent -should be revoked if it were -not being worked within the Realm; in spite of such revocation he could still import the patented article from abroad and sell it at a price which would preclude its manufacture in the United Kingdom.   This would not be possible if a.compulsory licence ^ere granted preferably to a British trader and the licensee given power to enforce ihe patent monopoly.   The patentee in that case will still receive nis rew&amp;rd in the shape of royalty and the genuine British Trade will be assisted.   In default of agreement the terras of the liaonee ^ill be settled by the Comptroller or Court on principles laid down in the Bill itself - and the Comptroller may call it in an arbitrator if it appears desirable in any case.^In the first clause (which is to be substituted for Section 27). it is proposed to provide a simple and inexpensive means of obtaining the^grant of&quot;compulsory licences and the working of patented inventions.   Any abuse of his patent rirh by the patentee, either by failure to work or to grant lie ex, on reasonable terms wherever the public interests demand, cr by unfair conditions imposed on the sale or use of the patent article, will render him liable to have his. patent revoked oi a compulsory licence granted on reasonable terms, wherever thi latter appears to be the fairer or more appropriate remedy,   k compared with the provisions of Section 24, the procedure for obtaining licences has been greatly simplified, while the grounds for applications have been enlarged, and more clearly expressed.   Application is to be made in the first instance to the Comptroller with an appeal to the Court.
A ZL QIdaIn the second Clause to be substituted for Section -  of the Act of 1907, it is proposed that the patentee should be allowed to declare his patent to be a &quot;licenee patent11; and in that case anyone who wishes may claim a licence under it as of right.   This is intended as an encouragement to the Commercial working of inventions and as a possible assistance to inventors who have no means   of exploiting their patents them-selves, or of coming in contact with those who wish to use the i^jianiiaa^QQiiJmerciallyi In default of agreement the terms of the licence are to be settled by the Comptroller or Court In framing this Section care has been taken that the patentee, does not evade the possibility of the revocation of his patent by converting it into a &quot;licence patent&quot;.This merely repeats Section ^4 (6) of tiie principal Act with the necessary modifications.Representations have freouently been made that the inves-tigations made by the Patent Office as to anticipations of inventions are not sufficiently wide in their scope and that an attempt should be macle to make the search universal.   Judging from the experience in other countries who profess to make a universal search it would appear that this is an unootainable ideal, but it was felt that in order to guard against the grant-ing Of invalid patents certain additional aTOund of opposition might usefully Be provided under section II of tne xxCt of 1907 by which the granting of patents might be opposed.   This dection provides that opposition may be filed (l) on the ground that the invention has been published prior to tiie application in any printed document which has been published   ana \Z) in the case of convention applications when the invention described in the specification filed in this country differs from that described -in the specification filed in the country of origin, and when - the additional matter forms the subject of an application made by the opponent in the interval between the leaving of the application in the foreign State and the leaving ol the applica-tion in this country.   The remainder of this Section is merely re-drafting consequent upon the amendments proposed.k        In this Section it is proposed to make provision for over-coming the difficulty which has arisen in some cases where tiie applicant has agreed in writing to assign the patent when granted to another party or joint applicant, and refuses to proceed with the application; such cases may under this Section proceed at the request of the person to whom tiie invention has been assigned when the original inventor declines to carry out his agreement.In most other countries which are signatories to the InUr-- national Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the terms of a patent is longer than that in this country and in no case is it less than fifteen years.   In this cinntry it has remained at fourteen yearst and the period dates from the date of application and hot of the grant.   Otiier countries and among them our principal Allies have frequently urged that this term should be extended, and the request may oe said to he supported by inventors generally.
k abe 8It is felt that the opportunity should now be taken of extend-ing the   term of patents to   - in  any case - fifteen  years in-stead  of fourteen.   This extension will  bring us  more into conformity  with  ether countries,   and v/ill also   be   a consider-able compensation - if any is required - for the somewhatwider  powers over patents given by section 1.   A further clause in the Section gives power by Order in Council to extendthe   term to sixteen   years;&quot; if this   is expedient in view of any conventions with   foreign countries.   The clause is   intro-duced because of a  general expression   cf opinion  on  the point of the Technical representations of cur Allies that sixteen &quot; yer-rs   should  be adopted as the term for the duration  of patentsDuring   the V/ar representation- have been  made by inventors from time to   time that the term of existing patents should be extended for the period of the Far.   In ^tne opinion of the Board cf Trade the   general extension of all   patents for the period   of the &apos;&quot;ar is   not a   course which can&quot;be recommended. Losses h-,;ve been universal in the War to   all classes aid to all trades and   the effect of any such proposal would be to single out inventors as a special class for special treatment, further it would not discriminate between those who have suffered and those who have largely  profited by  the TJar.   It is   thought, however, that power might be given&apos;to the Court to extend the   term of patents in proper cases upon applica-tion being-  m-^de under the existing procedure. In  proposing this   amendment it is, at the same time,   suggested&quot; that the period of extension should be reduced from seven and fourteen years respectively to   six and twelve.   It is   thought that this should be   done in view of the extension which   it is pro-posed to   give to   all patents now in existence of   one to   two years, as provided in section 6.be S.?se 10.The   Courts have for a long time   felt that the   issues in a patent action are far too  numerous and that it ought to &quot;be porsible to   try the real issue &quot;between   the parties cheaply and e:rpeditiously.   This section   is an attempt   to   simplify the   trial of  a oatent action by  confining it   to   the&quot;&quot;claim which   it   is   alleged has been infringed, rnd excluding other considerations or the validity of other claims. It   does   not in   any  way   alter the rights of the parties,   but simplifies procedure and saves the cost.   The results to   be obtained under the proposed   section can   only now be obtained by tv/o trials with an  intermediate application to   amend.   Provision is rn.de to   give the Court power to grant relief subject to discretion as to   costs and terms.This section deprives the plaintiff in an action for in-fringement ox the right to an account   of profits.   It   is   an expensive procedure and damages appears to be the proper and adequate remedy.In view ox the changes introduced by   the   new Section 27 (Clause 1),   it is thought undesirable that   sub-section 4 of Section 38 of the Act of 1907 should  remain;   moreover, it should be pointed out    that   ^ Section    38     provides that   the   insertion    of   such  a   condition    in  acontract
r contract is null and void.    There is a further objec-tion that it increases the issues in a patent action a state of affairs which is highly undesirable,,58 11* This section is intended to bring the law in GroatBritain into greater agreement with the laws of nearly all other countries which curtail the rights of patentees in &quot;the case of inventions relating to food and medicine.    It is felt to be in the publictinterest that there should be the right of free use of inventions so far as&quot;they are used for the manufacture of food and medicines;  but as the patent may also be of use for other purposes it is proposed only to restrain manufacture or use for food or medicines.;e 12,. Section 39 of the Act of 1907 gives the Comptrollerr power to award costs in certain cases.    Since the passingof that Act experience has shown that it is desirable that this power should be general in all proceedings under the Act before the Comptroller.    Section 29 is therefore re-pealed and the new section inserted in the &quot;general&quot; part of the Act, so as to make it applicable to all proceedings relating to patents and designs.ss 13. Under the present wording of Section 41 (2) of the Actof 1907 it mi^it be possible for a person to use an inven-tion secretly for a considerable period, and when his secret was discovered or disclosed by an employee he could obtain a valid patent if he at once applied for the grant.    It is folt that thi s is providing him with an unfair monopoly- and it is proposed that the protection afforded by this section -should not extend to cases where the invention has been work--ed commercially for more&apos;than six months prior to the publica-tion referred to therein.38 14* The only check at present on the registration of designsis in the case where the complots and almost identical design is found upon the register.    Tho consequence is that a large number oi worthless and unoriginal designs are reg-istered which may be used to hamper trade.    The present sec-tion has been framed therefore to give the Comptroller power to cancel any design which has been published in the United Kingdom prior to the date of registration.    It is further proposed to provide fey the cancellation of the registration of a design where it is applied by manufacture to any article in a foreign country and is not so applied by manufacture in the United Kingdom to such an extent as may do reasonably anticipated in the circumstances of the case and within a reasonable timeaHi It has been hold that Section 71 of the Act of 1907does not make it compulsory for an assignee of a patent or design to register his title in the registers at the Patent Office.    Considerable difficulties have arisen from time to time both in the office and outside in view of the fact that the name of the proprietor of any particular patent or design cannot be&quot;ascertained by looking at the Register,,    This section has been framed to make it compulsory to register any such assignment at the Patent OffiGe, and thus secure a complete history of any legal transactions connected with the Patent.
ause 16.        This amendment merely makes statutory what has been &quot; the practice for many years past*    Hitherto it hasbeen necessary to frame the decisions given under this section in such a form as to allow an appeal to the Law Officer and the present amendment does not alter the practice in any way.manse 17.        In consequence of the decisions given in theCourt from time to time, it has been found very diffi-cult to obtain a conviction under section 84 of the Act of 190?., where persons have held themselves out to be Patent Agents while not describing themselves as such by using the identical words &quot;Patent Agent&quot;. This section is not intended to injure those who are carrying on a bona fide, business but whose names are not at present upon the register of Patent Agents * It is merely an attempt to control those persons who are really practising as patent agents and to exclude from practice all undesirable persons.     It will have the effect of consolidating the profession of Patent Agents, and placing them all under a body which can exercise discipHnary powers similar to those exercised over solicitors by tne LawSooisb-*    The clause provides that any person not at present registered -but who proves to &quot;the satisfaction of the Board of Trade that prior to the day of he hasbeen Mna^fide. practising as a Patent Agent shall be entitled to be registered as such if he makes the -proper application for that purpose.Clause 18. The definition of &quot;patentee&quot; is amonded so as toharmonise with the amendment proposed in Clause 15 this making the person whose name appears on the register as the proprietor of a patent the only person entitled to deal with it.    The &quot;definition cf ^design&apos;&apos; is amended in order to bring it more into&quot;accordance with the principles of existing legal decisionsaThe schedule to the bill &quot;contains several minor amendments of the Act of 1907, which the experience of Yforking that Act lias shown to be desirable.    Many of the amendments are by way of deletion of matter which is now obsolete or merely make statutory what is at present Office practice.The amendment to Section 15 of the Act of 1907 &quot; gives the Comptroller power to grant a patent in lieu of a patent wnich has been revoked on the ground of fraudo    Hitherto it is only the Court which has had this-power;   although the Comptroller could revoke the patent on the ground that the invention had been obtained from the applicant he could not grant the applicant a fresh patent in lieu of the patent revoked.Amendment to Section 19 of, the Act,.,    At present all patents of addition stand or fall&quot; with the original patent,and in the event of the original patent being   &quot; revoked any patent of addition thereon is also revoked. By this amendment provision is made that where the original patent is revoked any patent of addition thereon may if so ordered become an independent patent.
The amendment to Section 29 of the Act provides that where a Government Department by their agents, con-tractors or others wish to use a patent they shall give such agents, contractors or others the necessary author-ity to do so in writing.Amendment to Section 36 of the Act.    Bxperience has shown tnat the terms of the present section are not wide enough to cover improper threatening under a Patent.    As the section is at present framed it   applies only to threats by the patentee himself.    Oases have arisen where a licensee has threatened others but taken no action, and the Courts have held that there is no rem-edy in such a case.    The proposed amendment is made with a view of counteracting this abuse.Clause 18 merely contains direction for the reprin-ting of the principal act with the amendments so that it may be read   as a whole.
