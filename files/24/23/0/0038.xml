WAR CAB 1282*IpS   ) -    ... &apos;- 4,.-,.v;&apos;;./      Health of British Forces Memorandum by the Secretary of State for WarWith reference to War Councij %$i  ((4) (5) and (6) ), I circulate the subjoined note for the inf^Tnartion of my-, colleagues. .   The charts mentioned therein have been j&amp;eirrt     the Secretary of the War Cabinet.DERfcT16th August, 1917*The mere enumeration of the number of admissions to Hospital affords no information as to wastage on active service on account of disease     Those diseases which influence wastage &quot;by causing deaths and invaliding such as Malaria. Enteric and Dysenteryi are those which a well ordered administration on the spot can diminish.     We therefore receive weekly reports of the incidence of these diseases, estimating their incidence per cent or per. mi lie and the amount of wastage which they are causing. ..&apos; We receive from Egypt, East Africa, Mesopotamia and Salonika an account of the weekly admissions for the preventable diseases. 1 Those for Salonika and Mesopotamia are shown on the accompanying Charts, but these figures in the case of kaLaria especially and in the case of Dysentery, are not to be taken to mean numbers of men.     They are the numbers of attacks in which three or four attacks are counted as three or four admissions, and not three off four men.     The only true indices of wastage are deaths anu\ invaliding, for the total admissions to Hospital include all manner.of minor ailments of no importance except that they have laid men up for longer or shorter periods.     The total number of men invalided from the East has.now been diminished on account of the difficulties of transport and we are, therefore, without this valuable indication as to the effect of the diseases upon, the strength of the Armies.All demands for material which have &quot;been made upon&apos; us have been and are being complied with, but I am unable to comply with the demands for medical officers.On the 26th July, the following demands had beenreceivedEgypt India; Salonika 3Sast Africa Mesopotamia PranceTotalit is impossible to comply with these demands.     The medical profession. has been,drawn upon^tp the utmost limits though it is believe^ that a. -$Vtifliv distribvitiih. of; civil medical *fpractitioners among the civil population would enable us tor&apos;111100 5215400710obtain
Obtain more than we can obtain at present.     This shortage of medical men is a. source of great anxiety %p m.e.We have, every reason to believe that Anti-Malarial measures are being pursued with vigour at Salonika,     This area was visited from time to time by the specially appointed Eastern Sanitary Commission, and many Malarial questions are being considered by a special Malarial Committee at the War Office, as well as by the Amy Sanitary Committee,     The recent rise in admissions in Mesopotamia is due to Heat $troke.We cannot at present give the ratios for British troops in East Africa, all.the returns we have had included the whole Force.     We have now asked for the white troops to be shown separately.
