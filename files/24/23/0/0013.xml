WAR   CABIKBg..,IMPERIAL PKBFSR&amp;TCS.(Note by the Secretary in regard to Foreign Office Memorandum of 3let July)In a memorandum dated July 31st, prepa,red by the ouanercinl Department of the Foreign Office, which has been cir-ulated to the War Cabinet at it?, Baifour16 request, the w^i-ser tates that &quot;I cannot trace anywhere that the acceptance of the rinciple of Colonial (sic) Preference was decided upon with the oncurrence of this Office&quot; and great stress is subsequently laid pon   the &quot;irritation and estrangement&quot; which may be caused between hie country and the Allies in consequence of the erection of a tariff wall round the British Empire&quot;.The memorandum wan evidently written in ignorance f the discussions which took place in tho Imperial War Cabinet On he question, and under a   misapprehension as to the actual character f the decision arrived at.    The question of Imperial Preference ccupied the greater part of two whole meetings (Nos. 11 and 12) of&quot;.he Imperial War Cabinet,     At both these meetings tho acting ecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Robert Cecil, was resent, and took an active part in the discussions.   He was alsoa. member of the sub-committee whioh was convened by the Seoretary f State for the Colonies, between the two meetings, in order to ettle the precise wording of the resolution which was agreed t6 in he Imperial War Cabinet and subsequently passed at the Imperial onforence.     It was, in fact, at his suggestion that, at the very utaet of the rosulution, the words &quot;having due regard to the in-ereBta of our Allies&quot; were inserted.     The question of the possible ffsct upon the Allies was discussed at both meeting^, and was one f the reasons why an alternative and more e^cplicit resolution, which n other respects commended itself to the majority of the Imperial ar Cabinet, was not proceeded with.There ie no reference in the resolution to any pro-poaal for the ereotion of a &quot;tariff wall&quot;.     The resolution states pimply that the Conference is in favour of the &quot;principle that eaoh part of the JEmpire, having due regard to the interests of our Allies, shull give specially favourable treatment and facilities to the produce and manufactures   of other parts of the Empire&quot;     The ainuteB of the discussion show that the facilities in question re-ferred more particularly to shipping and other similar facilitiesi and that with regard to tariffs the resolution does not mean that ariffa are to be imposed, but thatj wherever duties are imposed, those duties shall be mere favourable to the rest of the JEmpire then to any foreign country..(Intd)   M.P,A.H.E C R E .1-v. 1713.
