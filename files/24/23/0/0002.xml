I.

Proposed Parliamentary Question by Mr. A. Fell, M.P. Chairman, Channel Tunnel Committee of House of Commons.

Wednesday, 15th August, 1917.

103. Mr. Fell,- To ask the Prime Minister, if he can now say if the Government is in favour of the construction of the Channel Tunnel, provided that it is a condition that no work is to be done or money raised in connection with the tunnel during the continuance of the war except with the consent and at the request of the Government, and that on these conditions the Government will support the Bull when introduced to give the necessary powers to link up the South Eastern and Chatham Railways of England with the Chemin de Fer Nord of France. (Tuesday 14th August).



II.

Draft Reply.

The Cabinet have again carefully considered the question in consultation with their naval and military advisers and they are still of the opinion that it is not practicable to proceed further with the matter during the continuance of the war. In these circumstances it would not be possible for the Government to support a Bill of the nature indicated in my Hon. Friend&apos;s Question.



III.

Copy of letter dated 13th August, 1917 from Mr. A. Fell, M.P. to the Prime Minister.

Sir,

     I have been authoritatively informed that the Government has been advised by the Admiralty and the War Office that they both oppose the Channel Tunnel and that consequently, in answer to my question to-morrow, the Government will say that it will not support the Tunnel Bill proposed to be introduced in the Autumn.

At this last moment we urge reconsideration. This decision the Channel Tunnel Committee consider most unfortunate and it is quite unexpected.

On the board international question, it must have a depressing influence on our own people and on France, Italy and Belgium, where the question is being followed keenly.

 




alJtiixnlgh&apos;little appears in the Press on the subject.   It will be Y^^red with great-Balrtsjfaction in Germany.   It -points to the faot that the Peaco to be obtained will not be of long duration, and that after it is declared ttg shall not be able to devoto our energies to trade and commerce but shall still bo trammelled by a 30-called strategic and military oolicy.   The great enterprises v/hich are boing considered, and of which this is the foro-most, are still to be dependent on the Government Popart-merits, and under these conditions,, little will certainly bo done.This policy must kill our hopes for great increase of trad;, with Italy arid Switzerland and thoso countries wiil.be thrown back upon Germany for the sale of thsir produce and. tho great increase of commerce and trado expected with Franoe will be postponed,.If the Bill were supportod by the Government, the effect would have beon immediate in putting new heart into the Tiostern Allies, proving that they were to be knitted more closoly together after the war and giving them a great object to look forward to.... It would have strengthened their hands when dis-cussing terms of Peace and rendered Poaco itsolf nearer.The strategic difficulty raised is, perhaps, still more aisheartening.   Vihy the Admiralty was consulted, rce fail to understand.   If it.were a channel ferry or bridge, one could appreciate it.The question is - what has the Admiralty to do with tubes under the sea situate below any possible attack by min-s or explosives?The .7*ar Office is rightly asked how the tunnel mouths in England should be defended and where they should oraerge, but the policy involved in their construction is not. for the V/ar Office officials but for the Government to decide.   The officials change but they do not change their system.  :The Channel Tunnel &quot;dossier&quot; is handed on from the Duke of Cambridge and Lord woIseley down to the present holders and they all support the system and the old -theories. Aeroplanes.and submarinos or tho starving of this country haveno effect on their theories.The War Offico,: $$resume, looking-at the matter froma war point.of view only^bnsidor8 that the Peace to follow : will be only temporary arid *\$$.*ar-will begin again, in, say, ,yhe Gorraan-eu&amp;gested time oi^en years,. The tunnel would&apos;be :jn.operation; and, in&quot; the event of a Gorman warj the-soldiersallow its benefits would be incalculable.   If France and .. Belgium were neutral,.- tho source of supply from neutralSm?^68 ?0Sld *e available,-as Germany has- proved with , ttoiiand and Denmark,   The Channel would be impassable, win?to the submarines and the tunnel would be our means, of access
to neutral Europe.- The Germans aro fully aware of all this and so oppose the tunnel by every means^If the War Offloe suggestthat we should run the risk of invasion by France through the tunnel at some future time, this Committee declines to consider this suggestion or discuss it.If, however, a long Peace is to follow, then the tunnel is a matter of commerce and trade and not of strategy and that is how this Committee regards it. - If &apos; Peace is to endure.,for fifty yearsthere wi 11   o half-a-dosen &quot;tunneis^&amp;ef ore then - pouring wealth and commerce in arc. oivb of this country, and; no-one at the War Office would have the hardihood&apos;to prophesy what will be. the means of attaefe and defence at that &quot;date. -Our question is of such far-reaching importance that this Committee, comprising tho most &quot;active Members of the House of Commons., hope that the Government will take a broad view of the matter and be influenced as much by the opinions of our Allies and by the House of Commons as by the opinions of their own oxperts.I am,......Your faithful Servant,(Signed) FELL.Chairman, Channel Tunnel Committee of House of Commons.2 V.hitehall Gardens, S.1:, 14th&apos;August, 1917. &apos;
