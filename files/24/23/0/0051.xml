Z^6o 2248OPERATIONS.SECRET.Promt-   General Barter.13th August 1917.To:-C . I .G .S .Received August 16th, 3.30 p.m.1186.This evening I had a confidential interview with the Commander-in-Chief.     He has prepared, for immediate presentation to the Gov-crnment, a document which he showed, me.     It contains definite con-ditions regarding discipline and reorganization.Tho following are its principal features:-1st.   The proper authority of officers and the saluting ofofficers by soldiers must be restored.2nd.   Military discipline, with tho death penalty, to beapplied to railways.3rd.   Throughout the country and not only in the front lino there must be military control of food supplies in a military sense.4th.   There must be power in the whole interior to deal with disorder by military force.5th.   Proper pensions and proper pay for officers to bo re-established where these have been prejudiced.Those conditions arc in addition to those regarding dis-ciplinary measures at the front which have already been demanded.I presented your telegram 39420 to General Korniloff, and I assured him that you entirely approved of the disciplinary measures already reported to you.Korniloff assured me that he was determined to make a firm stand. At the same time he made it clear that he had not full confidence that the Government would support his conditions. He expressed the opinion that Kerenski was an opportunist and that ho could not be roliod on.
I asked the C-in-C. this direct question.   In the event of the Government hesitating to adopt his views, did he think it desirable for the Allied Powers to exert severe pressure through tho diplomatic channel?     He emphatically declared that, in that event, it would be the only step which might save the situation.It was then arranged between us that this premonitory message should be sent to you by me.     He promised that he would give&apos; me the earliest possible information regarding the course of events in order that I might transmit it to you. He thought that it might probably be in about three days; but in that case the question of time would be of great urgency.I myself ventured to express the opinion that if the Government will not concede Korniloffrs demands (he is gener-ally popular and his proposals are approved of by the most patriotic and most Intelligent Russians) there is no hope that any other commander will succeed better, in which event there is little chance of the Russian Army being restored to efficiency for a long time, for an indefinite period.-In that case Raumania is doomed and will make a separate peace; if, Indeed, she is not induced to join the Central Powers Korniloff agreed with this view, and also with the prospect of a winter of anarchy throughout Russia.Further, also, I hinted to the C-in-C that, in my judg-ment, it was possible that England would.....(1 group undeciph-erable)....have to reconsider seriously her military policy as regards co-operation in the West, the supply of guns etc. That we desired to employ our resources better v/here they would be of the most advantage against the common enemy.
Korniloff quite recognized the justioe of this possible change of attitude.After conferring at length with the Ambassador at Petrograd it is also my opinion that the Provisional Government may not be strong enough, even if willing, to impose Korniloff f&apos;e aemands on the Petrograd Committee of Soldiers and Workmen which forms such a strong proportion in the jviinistry including the notorious Tohernov whose mere presence in the Government is an ominous presage In connection with KorniloffTs ultimatum.     Personally I am of opinion that even if Herensky is really animated with good intentions, he will not be able to secure the adoption of KorniloffTs proposals by the Government.It is possible however that pressure by the Allied Powers might help him and in any case it would be easier for the Government if pressed severely from outside to concede Korniloff1s programme before it had already rejected it.I beg therefore to represent, in view of the urgency of the question of time,whether at the given moment it would not be expedient to grant the Ambassador at Petrograd power to apply this pressure immediately and collectively at the psychological moment.I again represented to Kbmiloff,acting on your telegram No. 39258. the urgent necessity of destroying the oilfields and crops in Roumania. To this he replied that he was taking the necessary preparatory measures but that he did not think that they would be required.The C. in C. said that there was better news from Roumania. Roumania had compelled Germans to retire &quot;before Okna and had taken 600 prisoners.
