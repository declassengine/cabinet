Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.At the War Cabinet held on Wednesday, August 15th, the Minister of Munitions produced certain figures with regard to the-wastage of guns in Prance.   The M.G.O. disputed the figures &quot;but had not the papers at hand to give details of actual losses.   The War Cabinet instructed him to prepare a paper on the subject and I now append it.    The War Cabinet will see it does not bear out the Minister of Munitions * statement as to our satisfactory state with regard to guns.   Guns are no good without carriages, and the deficit, therefore, in actual losses is much larger than the figures the Minister of Munitions placed before the War Cabinet.(ltd.)     D.16th August, 1917.At the meeting of the War Cabinet this morning, the Minister of Munitions gave some figures which - as I ventured to suggest at the time - may have led to a false impression.His point was, as I understood it, that in our demands on the Ministry we had asked for a larger number of guns for maintenance than the events of this Summer^ fighting have actually justified, and that consequently Sir Douglas Haig is better off than he expected to be at the time that the present operations were sanctioned by the War Cabinet.receive the following	6-inch	Howitzers	Hows.

Carrs.June	99	90July	97	80August	26	-26The difference up to date between promises and perform-ances is a surplus of 14 howitzers and a deficiency of 31 carriages.Exclusive of the 2 batteries which the War Cabinet decided yesterday to send to Russia we hope to be able to send to Sir D,HaigHows. Carrs.an additional 50&quot;&quot; 54 in Augustand 96 100 in September.It is quite true that during this summer&apos;s fighting we have only lost 168 6-in. Howitzers as compared with our budgetting for 170, but during the same period our losses in carriagefor
0 a 9for this nature have amounted to 1254, as compared with the 103 anticipated.Since our June promise to Sir D. Haig, we have sent 25 equipments to Italy, 32 to Egypt and 10 to Mesopotamia, making 67 in all.The reserves of 6-inch Howitzer equipments in prance to-day are 115 guns and 22 carriages, as against the authorized reserves of 47 guns and 47 carriages.Our armies in Prance to-day need 88 - 6-inch Howitzer equipments to equip the &quot;batteries in that country, and are short of a further 400 equipments to &quot;bring them up to the number of 6-inch Howitzers per division authorized in October, 1916.The allocation of these 8 equipments to Russia will delay tho possibility ef our making good our promises to Sir      Haig.Further, as I stated this morning, owing to his shortage in 13-prs, (on 22nd July this shortage was 282 equipments.   To-day it is 196), the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief in Prance is dependent on 6rinch Howitzers for much work, especially wire-cutting, which would otherwise be done by field guns.Another suggestion made by the Minister of Munitions was to the effect that we could well spare G-inch Howitzers as there were in Prance sufficient Howitzers to fire all the ammunition we can send them.As a matter of fact, so splendidly have our latest demands on tho Ministry for this ammunition boon met, that I am sanguine we shall be able to keep our Armies in Prance amply supplied in this nature; more over, with active operations being conducted by 4 out of the 5 Armies, it will readily be understood that every single 6-inch Howitzer that can be kept in action furthers our chances of success, at a smaller cost of our Infantry, even though the . total number of available rounds of ammunition remains constant.
