12 1/Uedi t err an ean/l 9 24.British Policy in Palestine.Memorandum by the Secretary of StaSe for War.1, General Sir Edmund Allenby has telegraphed to saythat it will &quot;be necessary in the interests of the safety of the troops to issue from tine to time proclamations of a purely military nature in occupied enemy territorijiy and that he presumed he may act accordingly without reference home..2, It is customary to give Commanders-in-Chief in thefield authority to issue proclamations as necessary, and General Allenby says that those he proposes to issue will be of a purely military nature.     It will, however, guide and assist him in issuing such proclamations if he is clearly informed as to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to Palestine, and I think the time has come when he should have this information.     In this case it is the more necessary as both the French and Italian Governments are closely interested in Syria.3. I should be glad of instructions from the War Cabinet,derby.14th Augusts 1917.
