From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 16t/i August 1917.Your telegram dated 15th August. Reforms. Following is final text ol announcement which I shall make in House of Commons Monday afternoon next.   You may publish simultaneously : &quot; The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with which the Government of India are in complete accord, is that of the increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration, and the gradual de-velopment of self-governing institutions, with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible Government in India as an integral part of the British Empire. They have decided that substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as possible, and that it is of the highest importance as a preliminary to considering what these steps should be, that there should be a free and informal exchange of opinion between those in authority at home and in India. His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly decided, with His Majesty&apos;s approval, that 1 should accept the Yiceroy&apos;s invitation to proceed to India to discuss these matters with the Viceroy and the Govern-ment of India, to consider with the Viceroy the views of Local Governments, and to receive with him the suggestions of representative bodies and others.&quot; I would add that progress in this policy can only be achieved by successive stages. The British Government and the Government of India on whom the responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement ol the Indian peoples must be the judges of the time and measure of each advance, and they must be guided by the co-operation received from those upon whom new opportunities of service will thus be conferred, and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can be reposed in their sense of responsibility.&quot; Ample opportunity will be afforded for public discussion of the proposals which will be submitted in due course to Parliament.&quot;I have telegraphed separately text of announcement regarding Commissions to your Army Department.Please acknowledge receipt of this telegram.
