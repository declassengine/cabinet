/ f^S^m, c/(o 383SECRET. Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. DST?*/005.WEEKLY REPORT ON SERBIA &amp; MONTENEGRO. V. (18 August, 1917).The Pact of Corfu.The outstanding fact in Serbian politics during the lastmonth is the Pact signed at Corfu on July 20 by the SerbianPrime Minister, Mr Pasic, and the President of the JugoslavCommittee of London, Dr Ante Trumblc.     This   has been publishedfairly fully in the press, so the twelve clauses of It need notm,therefore, be given here.   In the preamble to the agreement thefollowing passage occurs:&quot;The representatives of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes declare once moro and in a most categorical fashion that our nation of throe names constitutes but one nution, and that it Is the same by blood, by spoken and written language, by its feeling of oneness, by the continuity and oneness of the territory on which It lives, and by the common vital interests of its national existence and of the general development of its moral and material life&quot;.Pull agreement has been reached as to the constitution of a future &quot;Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&quot; under the Karadjordjevi6 dynasty as a &quot;constitutional, democratic and parliamentary monarchy&quot;.     In that State complete equality for the three peoples constituting it is assured.   A claim is made for the Incorporation in it of all the compact territories inhabited by the Jugoslav peoples &quot;who demand nothing that belongs to others, but only what is their own&quot;.     The signatories &quot;refuse consciously and firmly all partial solutions of the problem of its  -deliverance from Austro-Hungarian domination and of union with Serbia and Montenegro in a State forming one Indivisible whole&quot;.
Thus is summed up in an official document the final, decision of the peoples both of the Serbian Kingdom and of those still under Austro-Hungarian rule, in so far as their views can be expressed through their representatives abroad.The Effect In Austria-Hungary.No Jugoslav papers from Austria-Hungary have yet come to hand so it is impossible to quote their direct opinions on the Pact.   In any case they must, gf course, bo careful in their expression of these opinions, as they are confronted by the danger of sentences for high treason.   The intransigeant tone of the Magyar press shows that there is no doubt in Hungary as to the real views cf the Jugoslavs of the Hungarian Kingdom. Further consideration *f this point does not fall vd.th.in the scope of this Report, but attention may be drawn in this connection to the remarks on the subject In the recent Weekly Reports on Austria-Hungary, especially Nos. XII and XIII, issued by this Bureau.   The language employed by the leader of the Peasant Party, Mr Radii, in the Croation Diet is of special significance.Italy and the Jugoslavs.A marked change is taking place in the attitude of sections of the Italian press towards tho question of Jugoslav unity. At least three significant articles have recently appeared in the Corriere dolla Sera (on July 25, August 5 and August 14). This important Milanese paper, which has hitherto displayed considerable distrust and even dislike of the Jugoslav movement, now emphasises the fact that an agreement between Italy and the
Jugoslavs is absolutely necessary for the future safety andprosperity of both.   The Corriere della Sera does not make itplain -whether Italy is prepared to forego any of the territorialclaims assured to her by treaty with the Allies in furtheranceof - tMs--understanding with the Jugoslavs, but at least progresshas been made towards this end in that this paper obviouslycontemplates the formation, within whatever boundaries, of aJugoslav State.     A fuller, still more friendly, and more liberalview of the question is to be found in the Roman weekly Unltaof August 2, which emphatically declares itself in favour of aJugoslav State alike for reasons of justice and of interest.The following passage may be quoted from the article as typicalof its tendency:&quot;As regards Italy&apos;s AllieB the creation of Serbo-Croat-Slovene unity is an absolute necessity for England because only when Germany and Austria have boen shut off from the Aegean will England be safe In the Eastern Mediterranean. Henceforth England would defend the Isthmus of the Suez against Germany by means of the new Serbia on the line of the Drave;   and in this Italy has the same interest as England. Cjltifis Italy1 s good fortune that a solution of the audoW^&amp;lav problem favourable to her interests and those of the anti-German Powers is possible, thanks to the movement towards unification with Serbia which has grown steadily more intense during the last twenty yearsin Slovenia and Croatia......It Is thus evident whatshould have been Italy1s policy if we really wanted to dismember Austria - to take up once more our splendid Mazzinian and Garibaldian tradition and proclaim ourselves allies and champions of the Southern Slavs against the Germans and Magyars&quot;.The conciliatory attitude of the Corriere della Sera towardsthe Jugoslavs is mainly due to the fact that the fear has gainedground In Italy that Italy&apos;s British aid French Allies mightcontemplate terms of peace which would leave Austria-Hungary inexistence.   Recent speeches made in the House of Commons havebeen Interpreted in this sense not only in Italy, but also inAustria-Hungary and Serbia.   Mr Lloyd George&apos;s stirring advocacy
i 4.of the Serbian cause at the luncheon of the Serbian Society on August 8 hss, therefore, been hailed with relief by the Serbian press.     The official organ Srpske Novine (published in Corfu) greets the speech with enthusiasm.   It says; &quot;This great defender of the doctrine of the rights of small peoples h&amp;s spoken wordswhich will always remain groat and sacred for us.....We areparticularly grateful that such words should have been uttered by Lloyd George, for in our eyes these words are deeds&quot;.Conditions in Serbia.Shortly before the Reichsrat was adjourned the Slovene deputy from Trieste Ribar drew attention to the fact that 30,000 Serbians had been deported from the country and sent to Asia Minor. This appears to have been mainly from the Morava district, to which the Bulgarians continue to pay special attention.   The objects of these deportations are mainly neither military nor economic, but directly political, for the Bulgarian Government has set itself the task of turning the Ivloravu Valley into a &quot;Bulgarian&quot; country, in order to be able to claim it (and rith it a territorial link with Austria-Hungary) before the Peace Conference.The Attitude of Montenegro.The Rome Correspondent of the luorning Post (August 10) ventured on the statement that as far as Montenegro is concerned it seems to be extremely unlikely that the people or the dynasty will be inclined to&apos; merge themselves in the now proposed Kingdom (of Jugoslavia).   In support of this statement he could merely quote the fact that &quot;in a recent Interview with tho Tribuna King Nicolas showed no signs of wishing to resign his rights&quot;.
The Correspondent (Mr William Miller) strangely assumes that King Nicolas&apos; wishes are shared by the majority of his subjects. As was pointed out in TVeekly Reports III and IV this is almost certainly not the case.     The Montenegrin &quot;Committee for National Union&quot;, at the head of which is Mr Andrija Radovic, continues to issue in Geneva its paper Ujedihjenje (&quot;Union&quot;), and is now also publishing a monthly Bulletin   Montenegrin   in French in the some town.      The latter expresses the need for union as follows:-&quot;A Montenegro separated from Serbia and its other brothers would be just as if, after the liberation of Italy, a Duchy of Parma had been allowed to exist, and incomparably less justified than a State of the Two Sicilies separated from the rest of the Kingdom of Italy&quot;.Judging from recant Cabinet crises in Montenegro, Mr Radovic&apos;s Committee is supported by almest the whole of Montenegrin educated opinion.18.8.17AWAL
