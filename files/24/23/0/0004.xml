G T.-1704        EFFECT ON GEKSfi.41. TO PAGE&apos; CAPACITYA^l&apos;ClMT^r^BBIM&apos;l)S&quot;yQR OIL &quot;FUEL .FOR THE ffAVY&quot;:Copy of letter from the Shipping Controller to the Secretary, War Cabinet.-Ministry of Shipping St. Jameses Park, London, S.W.I.Reference Ho.SCO.32.8.17 13th August, 1917.Pear Hankey,I send herewith copy of a- Memorandum I have sent to the First Lord..    I think the matters referred to require serious consideration of the Government.     I do not think it is realised in this country the extent to which&quot; our Navy is dependent on the goodwill of the United States, and I understand all the Super-Dreadnoughts are adapted for oil fuel only, of which we have practically none produced in this country.     I believe oil is more effective but ships might be adapted for the burning of either coal or oil fuel.I.should think it likely that you will hear from the First I*rd relative to the matter, for the information of the Cabinet.Yours faithfully,(Signed)     J.P.HACLAY.ENCLOSURE.NOTE forwarded by the SHIPPING CONTROLLERto theFIRST LORD,OF THE ADMIRALTY.The Shipping Controller is of opinion that the time has come when full consideration should be given to the policy of building warships for the Navy which are entirely dependent on oil fuel.     It is a question whether It wouid not he better in view of all the circumstances, either(l)   to build coal burning - ships,(2)   to build ships which can burn either oil or coal.The Admiralty have already no: doubt given consideration to this question, but the demands made by the Navy on our general tonnage capaoiiy for the maintenance of the oil supply the Fleet are now so serious that the Shipping Controller&quot;; ieels it to be his duty to bring the matter to the notice of the War Cabinet from this point of view.It is understood that the present stock of oil&quot;fuel &apos;(fr the Navy is such as to give grave cause for alarm, and the Shipping Controller has assented to various measures which are designed to prevent its further depletion, and to place the reserve on a more satisfactory footing.
^h^ejmeaim^6^rl3JL result&apos; in(l)   the diminution of our imports from theUnited States and Canada of other commod-itiesj - by about .1^ million tons per annum, owing to the necessity of importing that quantity of oil in the double bottoms of liners and cargo stearners.(2)   The annual allocation of about 480,000tons^ gi-oss of new construction to replace tile estimated losses of tank steamers by submarine attack.   This figure amounts to no less than one-fifth of the entire new merchant ship construction under the programme   approved by the War Cabinet, representing a loss in terms of imports, -   of at least 1,700,000 . tops over a period of twelve months.Bven allowing for these measures being taken, it will be a matter of extreme difficulty to raise the ivavy fuel oil, reserve beyond three, or at the most, four months^    consumption.Apart from the above it&apos;is obvious that we are entirely dependent on the United States for the mobility of our Bavy and any failure of the United States&apos; supply, or any action by the United States Government to restrict that supply, would be a determining factor in our War policy,.-It is &quot;recognised that it is probably impossible to alter this position&apos;-in regard to existing ships, but it is submitted that before the policy of continuing to build oil burning ships-at all events of the larger classes - is decided upon,  the matter should be fully reviewed in the light of the above facts (bearing in mind the fact that we have supplies of coal in this country which are believed to be ample.)N.B.&apos; In estimating the encroachment on ourcargo - carrying capacity due to oil require-ments no account has been taken of the commercial petroleum needs.   To maintain these at. a minimum figure.. . a further 250,000 tons of capacity per annum from U.S.A. must be diverted for double bottom shipments, and an additional quantity of 240,000 tons gross per.annum must be allowed for out of our mercantile construction programme, to replace losses of commercial oilers.
