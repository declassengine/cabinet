SJCRET.G.T.-1732W 4j0 A IS I M b T,RaGOQHITIOB. AS REP3ESiMINg CIVIL SERVANTS. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTRY OP LABOUR.(For Memorandum by tho Conciliation ui Arbitration Board, see Peper G.1,1731)Tho praotiee of the Ministry, as regards its own staff, continues that adopted by the Board of Trade, namely, that on subjects affooting the terms of employment of tho stsff, the Ministry will only deal officially with those organisations whose membership is oonfined to employees of tho Department. It is felt that, in view of the special nature of tho duties of tho Department, the greatest possible care should be taken to ensure that the reputation of tho Department for absolute neutrality as between employers and employed and indepondonoo in dealing with Trade Unions and other Associations should not bo impaired.   T/hile, therefore, any recognised Associations should be fully adequate to represent the grievances of the staff themselves, it is not considered desirable that thoy should form part of, or be affiliated to outside organisations which are bound to identify themselves with tho interests of one of the parties. It has not, however, been required as a condition of recog-nition that the responsible officers of a Departmental Association, as well as the members, should be di-awn exclu-sivcly frcm the Officers of the department, though all the officers of the recognised Departmental Associations aro, in fact, officers of the Department.It is bolieved that the practice herein outlined is, generally speaking, that of other Government Departments, though certain Civil Service Associations e.g,, the Postmen1s Federation are affiliated to the Labour Party. The labour Party, is of course, a political organisation, and the general rule that Government Departments recognise officially only Associations of their own employees is not affected by such affiliation.In their rules as to the making of representations by the Employees in HcM. Dockyards and Naval Eatablish-raents respecting the conditions of their employment, the Admiralty admit to only a very limited extent the right of outside Associations to submit grievances for con-sideration, and anything approaching full recognition i.e. the representation Of the smployoes concerned by an outside Association is not accorded-     Under the Admiralty system of &quot;Annual Hearing of Petitions&quot; the case for tho employees submitting comp3aints, grievances or requests, may be presented at interview by delegates who are chosen from amongst themsol^es, and who may be accompanied by other persons, not necessarily in tho Admiralty employment to assist them in submitting their petition.It appears to the iiinistry of Labour that in dealing with Government employees a distinction should be drawn between those who aro public servants engaged in administrative work and those who are simply doing industrial work for a Government Department.   It is clear that all Government servants to a greater or
leaser degree are required to preserve impartiality in dealing with the public of all sections, and that this cannot bo expected if they are members of and . represented by outside organisations.   The Trade Unions necessarily play,such e large part in publio llfey and will probably be a larger part in tho future, that there aro few:--Departments of State activity which do not touch thorn.   Ae has already been pointed out, those considerations apply vith particular foroo in the case of tho Smploymdnt Exchange Officers, but thoy aro almost equally explicable to tho Staff of the national Health Insurance Commission, the Loeal Governnumt Board and other Departments,    ho Minister of Labour therefore considers that at present there are strong grounds for regarding tho administrative and clerical branches of the Civil Service as on a different looting from thOBe engaged in industrial occupations in the Government omploy, iind that whereas he is inclined to think tho recognition of Trade. Unions in tho Admiralty Dockyards in a fuller measure than at present would produce good rather than harm, he thinks that tho contrary might be the caso as regards tho administrative and clerical branches of the Service..    In any caso it would be advisable before arriving at any general decision in the matter to carry out tho reeomraondation of the iioyal Commission to institute a Special Enquiry into the whole question.   Such an Enquiry would hardly be opportune at the present time, as tho conditions and the personnel of the Service.have been considerably affooted by the Var.   In the meanwhile it is suggested that it v/ould be best for the Coneilia-tion and Arbitration Board for Government Zrnployoos to intarpret their terms of reference and method of pro-cedure strictly, and to hear only these Associations whoso membership is confined to the Civil Service.
