[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government/Printed for the War Cabinet   August 1917.SECRET AND CONFIDENTIAL.TRANSATLANTIC FISH SUPPLIES.INEXPENSIVE and abundant food may help to win the war and tide over the difficulties of the first months of peace. If fried fish shops in large industrial centres can be supplied with fish cheaply and plentifully it may become a matter of supreme importance. In all probability also the exportable meat supply of the world for some time to come will be inadequate to meet the increased demand which will be made, owing to the depletion of flocks and herds in belligerent countries and to the use of meat every day to which men on active service will have become habituated.For these two reasons I desire to call attention to the attached-[scheme (Appendix) for placing large quantities of frozen fish on the market in this country at cheap rates.The supplies of fish landed by British fishing vessels have, mainly as a result of the demands of the navy for men and ships, decreased by approximately 75 per cent. This decrease is likely to be progressive while the war lasts. The resumption of fishing operations after the war can only be gradual, and a considerable time must elapse before the home supplies reach their pre-war level. On the other hand, the existing fishing-power of Canada and Newfoundland is not now exerted to its full capacity, and largely increased supplies could be taken in Canadian, Newfoundland, and Labrador waters if there were a certain market for them. The fish resources of those waters are, for the present at any rate, inexhaustible.The Reid Newfoundland Company is preparing a large system of cold storage. They already have a freezing plant at work at St.&apos; Johns, Newfoundland, where some hundreds of thousands of pounds of fish have been already frozen. Their scheme contemplates the erection of ten other local cold storage plants. The completion of the scheme only awaits the development of a certain market.Furthermore, Canada is ripe for a great development of the fishing energy. If a certain market were secured an organisation would rapidly be formed in Canada for operations on lines similar to those of the Reid Newfoundland Company. It is stated that the Bank of Montreal would be prepared to back the enterprise financially, and that a capital of from 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 dollars would be available. It seems to be probable that the new organisation, if formed, and the Reid Newfoundland Company would act generally in co-operation.The proposal is that the British Government should undertake to purchase, at an agreed price and subject to inspection, for the period of the war and a year or eighteen months afterwards, all the frozen fish, with the exception of one or two special kinds, which the Reid Newfoundland Company and the contemplated Canadian Company could send to this country, up. to, say, 2,000,000 lb. a week, or whatever limit it may be thought necessary to fix. If this step were taken, it is believed that a supply of at least 1,000,000 lb. a week could be maintained after September, and could be rapidly increased to whatever limit the Government might fix. The fish would be delivered from the cold storage alongside the ships, headed, dressed (i.e., offals removed), and cased, at a price, say, of Ad. a lb., and could be landed in England at a price of A%d. per lb. The value of this kind of frozen fish as food is already recognised, and it is largely used in the rationing of Canadian troops as well as of British troops in this country.The saving in tonnage is great. A refrigerator steamer could make four round trips between St. John&apos;s, Newfoundland, or Halifax, and Liverpool in the same time as an Argentine beef boat could make one trip between the River Plate and Liverpool; moreover, the packing space of fish is less than that of meat. Thus, 24,000,000 lb., of fish could be brought to England in the same tonnage and time as 4,000,000 lb. of edible beef.
A condition of the success of the- scheme would be the provision of additional cold storage at convenient centres in this country. It would, not, however, probably be necessary to defer the adoption of the scheme until the cold storage was installed, as accommodation could probably be found for early consignments, before the scheme was fully developed, in existing cold storage in the country.R. E. PROTIIERO.APPENDIX.Scheme.Canadian, Newfoundland, and Labrador Fish Supplies.NOW that fish supplies have been organised for British and Canadian troops in England, steps might advantageously be taken in connection with the feeding of the civil population in England for the following particular reasons: I. The impaired condition of the home fish supplies owing to the usage of trawlers (probably long after war ceases) for mine-sweeping and patrol purposes, and the fact that it will obviously be some considerable time before the British fishing industry can possibly be rebuilt to the previous productive power. (Trawlers and drifters having been sunk, Scotch fishermen who were Naval Reserve men having been drowned, and also large bodies of Scotch fishermen having joined Highland regiments, been killed and maimed in battle.)2. The large financial saving effected by the use of sea fish as compared with meat, fish being boug-ht to-day for British troops at 6f cents^3^i. per lb. with five-eighths of Id. added for freight, or about 3fd per lb. free in England, this price being for all dressed fish, that is, the heads off and offal removed, packed 200 lb. of netc fish in each case.3. The fact that the revenue from Canadian, Newfoundland, or Labrador frozen fish would remain in the Empire and would also help to foster the fishing industry in these places where for the last twenty years it has practically stood still. The great possibilities in encouraging these overseas fishing grounds to breed men suitable for Royal Naval or Naval Reserve purposes should certainly not be overlooked.4. The immense saving in steamship tonnage and time, inasmuch as a refrigerator steamer could make four or five round trips between, say, St. John&apos;s, Newfoundland, and Liverpool in the same time as one meat refrigerator steamer would take to make one trip between Liverpool and the Argentine.5. The enormous increase in the quantity of food entering England since the fish are packed in solid bulk in less space than sides of beef, and everything on the fish as packed is edible, whereas bone has to be removed as waste from the meat.6. The Canadian, Newfoundland, and Labrador fishing interests are most anxious to help in any way to get up production by building cold storage warehouses at suitable points on the coast, where practically unlimited quantities of fish can be got, and in a very short time after having the Government order to go ahead could produce fish to feed the whole of Britain if needed. These fishing industries would not require any help in the way of c ipital to undertake this big development, but would require an order for at least the duration of the war and about eighteen months after, so as to encourage them to go ahead with this big undertaking, which would mean an outlay of millions of dollars.7. In regard to quantities it has been figured that, if arrangements were made now to go ahead with this fish supply, by September of this year about 5,000,000 lb. to 6,000,000 lb. of dressed fish would be available for the public use, this over and above what the army are now taking, and that by the spring or early next summer this quantity could be arranged for weekly (as stores for freezing were built).8. In regard to price, it has been pretty clearly figured that if a large quantity were to be got, the price fee at steamer with guaranteed Government inspection at Atlantic ports would need to be about 8 cents, or Ad. per lb. for dressed fish, cases free.   This price landed in England would be about 4\d. per lb.
9. Tinned fish could also be arranged for very cheaply in 1-lb. cases, either for selling to civil population or for refugees.10. After the war, meat being a big price, and for years to come, this cheap fish food would greatly help the poorer classes to help out their food troubles.11. This fish has been a big success with Canadian and British troops, and if rightly thawed out by putting in cold water, cooks just like fresh fish, and as the public are now buying big quantities of frozen salmon and halibut, there is no doubt they would take to any kind of fresh frozen hsh.
