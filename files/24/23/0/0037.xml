79/Irish/469/7*7WAR CABINETArms in Ireland,iiieinorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for WarI circulate a copy of a minute which has been addressed to the Chief Secretary for Ireland by the- General Officer Commanding-in-Chief the Forces in Ireland,DERBY16th August, 1917.With regard to our conference on the question of the Arms in the possession of unrecognised Associations, it appears to me that the Conference of the Irish National Volunteers called &quot;by Colonel Moore on Sunday last has materially altered the situation.-As far as I can gather from the reports of this meeting,&apos; Colonel Moore and his followers passed a resolution advocating re-union with the Irish Volunteers, and formed a Committee to enter into negotiations with the leaders of that Body, with a view to the formation of a National Army for Ireland.     This will mean in effect that many of the arms in possession of the Irish National Volunteers will pass into the hands of a disloyal organization.From the military point of view this is a matter of extreme importance and danger.     I consider it is necessary for the purpose of securing the public safety to take possession of the Arms of the National Volunteers as far as it is possible,to do so, and more especially those arms which are at present collected in armouries..Before taking action as Competent Military Authority under Regulation 2 (e) I desire to know whether I have your full concurrence in such action.
