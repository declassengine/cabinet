WAR CABINETConscientious Objectors memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,Mr, Asquith spoke to me a few days ago with reference to the position of those Conscientious Objectors whose exemption from service he considers should be made absolute..and in conformity with his wishes Brigadier General Childe and I met him and Mr. MoKenna at the House of Commons.     The subjoined precis describes the interview and has been approved as being correct by Mr, Asquith.I gather that there is a oertain pressure being put upon him by some of; his followers to bring the matter before Parliament on the ground that hiB pledges to Parliament with regard to the absolute exemption of certain Conscientious ObjectorB are not being properly fulfilled.There is no doubt that Conscientious Objectors in some oases have got the right to complete exemption, but the right to give such exemption is vested in the Statutory Tribunals,     These Tribunals in some cases refuse&apos;to give complete exemption, and in other cases the Conscientious Objectors themselves refuse to plead, in which case naturally their cases are not heard and they are treated as ordinary conscripts.     It is these cases which really give us the most difficulty and personally I should be very glad to get rid of them, but certainly not in the way that Mr.Asquith suggests.In order to make the matter clear I should explain that the War Office set up a Central; Tribunal which is a non-statutory body and is simply used as an advisory body to assist the War Office in determining whether or he men who claim conscientious objections and have been over-ruled by Tribunals have really got a right to be considered at ail events for work of national importance other than actual soldiering.     This Body has no powers..     It is presided over by Lord Salisbury. It has given us the greatest assistance, and Mr. Asquith bore testimony to the admirable way and thorough impartiality with which it has done its work.  , But here again we are faced with the difficulty of the men who have refused to plead before Tribunals and have refused to .go before the Central Committee. A typical case is Mr.Stephen Hobhou.ee*-   I do not think there is the least doubt in his case that ne is a genuine Conscientious Objector - one of the very few, who exist * and personally I should be glad to liberate him, but there is no method by which this can be done-     It would be very inadvisable to accept Mr. Asquith1s method, which is this.     That the Secretary of State, of his own initiative* should, from amongst those men who refused to plead, select any who, in his opinion, are really Conscient-ious Objectors and ask the Central Tribunal to consider their case without the man himself appearing as he probably would :: refuse te plead.    This   is asking me to pull chestnuts out of the fire- to redeem Mr. Asquith*s pledges and I have no wish to undertake a   particularly disagreeable task.     If these men are to be liberated it can only be done by an Act of Parliament which would entitle every man who had undergone imprisonment for refusing to obey an order to have his case examined by the Central Tribunal, and to give the Central Tribunal statutoryrights
rights to give complete exemption.,     I de^not think: thlsfweuld. ^ he a popular Bill at all, &quot;but still-if Mr. Asquith aoes think that his pledges have been violated the Vfar Cabinet way think something must be done to give effect to them, and if such a Bill is to be introduced I should frankly st?ite in introducing it that it was brought in simply and solely at Mr. Asquith&apos;8 request,     I very much doubt whether either House of Parliament, would consent to pass it,DERBY21st August, 1917.The Secretary of State accompanied by the Director of Personal Services met Mr. Aequith and Mr. MoKenna in Mr, Asquith&apos;s room at the House of Commons on the 2nd August to discuss the position of absolutists.It was represented by Mr. Asquith and Mr, McKenna that according to information which they had received there were some 800 men termed &apos;absolutists&apos; new in prisen undergoing sentences inflicted by Courts Martial,    The point as to repeated trials was raised by Mr. Asquith but it was explained to him that now that the Army Council had ceased to make remissions repeated trials would automatically cease.     Mr. Asquith suggested, in effect, that the fact that these men had suffered and were suffering and were prepared to continue te suffer imprisonment might be deemed to be prima facie evidence of the genuineness of their &apos;conscientioue1 objections.     It was pointed out to Mr% Asquith that such a view could not be accepted and that only an appearance before a tribunal, and a finding of a tribunal of conscientious objection, could be accepted as proof thereof.    Mr. Asquith quite concurred but urged that the Central Tribunal should now be asked to reconsider these cases in the light of the fact that the men had undergone long periods of imprisonment and be asked te express an opinion as to whether or not they now considered that the men concerned had established the bona fides of their conscientious objection.    Mr. Asquith made a point that all other relevant circumstances should in each case be taken into consideration. It was pointed out to IxT. Asquith that the absolutists now in prison consisted of men who fell in the following categories(a) Those who have been rejected by the tribunal -about 91 EiSh.(b) Those who refused to plead before the tribunal -about 462 men.(c) Men who refuse to accept the conditions of work -about 301 men.Mr. Asquith was informed that the Central Tribunal has hitherto always refused to permit a man to appear before them again who had previously refused to plead but had subsequently changed his mind.    Mr, Asquith was also informed that the Director of Personal Services had always supported such requests but that the Central Tribunal had not been able to see their way clear to grant it. xMr. Asquith was made aware that the military authorities took grave exception to men being given their release from military service by administrative means who had been put into the Army by Act of Parliament.     It was pointed out to Mr, Asquith that there -were some four or five hundredmen
men who had &quot;been granted certificates of complete exemption and it was recognised by the military authorities that there were many hundreds of men who were forced into the Army through the ineptitude of the tribunals who should hare been clearly given exemption by the tribunals when acting in their statutory capacity.     The Military authorities at the War Office held the view that a just and proper procedure to take would be by short legislation to give the Central Tribunal the power to re-examine the cases of conscientious objectors who had been given exemption as well as those who had been forced into the Army and to provide that such men who satisfy the tribunal should obtain their certificates of exemption or, if serving in the Army should be given release from military service,     Mr. Asquith doubted whether there was any necessity for legislation which he pointed out would take a long time and arouse controversy.     He thought the case of real urgency might be met if, after reference to the Central Tribunal, and with its approval, the Army Council should give discharges to conscientious objectors now serving in the Army.     It was pointed out to Mr. Asquith that the immediate effect of giving a discharge to a conscientious objector in the Army might be to turn all the alternativists now working under the Brace Committee into absolutists.     Mr Asquith said that this dnager had occurred to him, but he did not think it a formidable one.    The Central Tribunal would make short work of such cases.Briefly summarized the request of Mr. Asquith was that the Central Tribunal should be asked by the Army Council to re-examine the cases of the absolutio-ts and if, on a re-examination of the whole circumstances of each 6ase, the good faith of the objector was established to the satisfaction of the Tribunal, the man should receive   his discharge from the Armys He added that if the Central Tribunal refused to undertake such further investigation he did not see that the War Office could do anything more in the matter-Lord Derby undertook to give the matter consideration.
