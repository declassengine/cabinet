&apos;7)^ EIGHTH REPORT BI THE BOARD OP TRADE ON /  IMPORTS AND INDUSTRY IN RELATION TOSHIPPING.A Report has been prepared on imports and industry inrelation to shipping, which shows the position at the end ofJune,   The outstanding points seem to be:-(1) In July 1917 the tonnage of goods imported amounted to 3,421,000 tons, a decrease of 16$ on July 1916.   This decrease is considerably smaller than the corresponding decrease on 1916, i.e. 25$, that took place in June. But as against 1913 the percentage decreases in June and July were the same, namely 36$,   On a general review of 1917, it appears that the percentage reduction as against both 1916 and 1913 has tended to grow larger in the later months.   None the less the actual imports during May June and July together have exceeded Sir Alfred Watson&apos;s and Mr. Elderton^s estimate by over li million tons or 20$. (2) In July the imports placed upon the restricted list were down by 688,000 tons or 64$ as against 1916 and by 81$ as against 1913.   But the imports of unrestricted goods were larger by 30,000 tons or 1% in July 19174   than in July 1916.   As against 1916 this is a consider-able improvement upon the position shown in June, but, if the comparison is made with 1913 there is little change.(3) Among unrestricted goods the imports of grain and flour exceeded the corresponding imports in July 1916 by no less tftan 442,000 tons or 58$ and meat imports were up by 9,000 tons or 11$.   The imports of raw cotton weredown bv 56$ on what tkay wee in July.,1916, a reduction
slightly greater than ruled in June.   But the export of j jn cotton manufactures were only 5% less than a year ago.. In the Beport detailed enquiries are made as to the stocks of timber, vegetable oils, mineral oils, flax and leather. These being already condensed do not lend themselves to summary.   The position appears to be very serious as regards motor spirit and kerosene.   Attention is called to the very large consumption of petrol, no less than 4,000 tons a month, by the Home Army.   The cotton position is also very serious.   Under a scheme sanctioned by the Board of Trade on August 9th, the machinery kept at work will be largely cut down.   It appears to be vital that a monthly import of at least 55,000 tons of American cotton should, if that is in any way possible, be maintained. For July as for previous months the reduction as against 1913 in tons of goods imported was much less than the reduction of tonnage entrances (with cargo);  but tiie ratio was somewhat less favourable than it had been in June.   As against 1916 the improvement in July and June alike was very small.In July the entrances of British vessels, exclusive of certain special registered vessels for which returns are available for the first time in June 1916, were 1,854,000 tons (i.e. 4% more than in July 1916)   This is a great improvement on June when British entrances were 11$ down on 1916.   Foreign entrances stand in about the same relation to 1916 as they did on the averagB of May and June.   British, clearances were 1,348,000 tons, (i.e. 16% less than in July 1916).   Foreign clearances are still about half what they were in the corresponding period of 1916. When foreign vessels are divided up into groups according to nationality, it appears that in July the entrances both of Allied vessels (otiier than the United States of iimerica)and
and of united States vessels were considerably better, relatively to 1916 than they had been in June.    Neutral - entrances on the other hand showed no improvement. Prom April onwards they have stood at about one third of what they were in the corresponding months of 1916.(S)During July the tonnage of British ships over 500 tons ompleted and brought into service amounted to 84,000 tons as against 49,000 tons in vune and 130,000 tons in May:   and the total gains from all sources, including ships requisitioned abroad, amounted to 179,000 tons as against 103,500 tons in June and 192,000 tons in my. The losses in July from enemy action and marine risk together, for all British ships over 500 tons, amounted to 356,000 tons as against 438,000 tons for June and 402,000 tons for May.    Bir Alfred Watson&apos;s and ^ Blderton*s forecast of losses in July was 350,000 tons.(9)0n June 30th 1917 there were (including prizes) a grand total of 16,435,000 tons of British shipping actually in existence.    These figures included 466,000 tons of vessels repairing and 373,000 tons of vessels launched but not completed.      Thus the tonnage of vessels over 500 tons actually ready for use amounted to 15,594,000 tons, including 979,000 tons of oilers.    If the rate of sinking that orevailed during the first half of 1917 continues on the average till the end, we may expect a further destruction of 2^million tons by December 30th, 1917.    furthermore, it is prudent to allow for an increase in vessels out of use to undergo repairs from MUnsuccessful&quot; submarine attacks of another i.of a million tons.       On the other cide it was estimated by the Admiralty Controller that on present arrangements there will   be completed for use, between June 30th5 1916 and the end of 1917, in British shipyards, 1,091,000 tons and in foreign
shipyards, 325,000 tons, making a total of 1,417,000 tons.    !Pbus when gains and losses are balanced against one another, it appears probable that at the end of 1917, the British mercantile steam fleet of vessels over 500 tons  actually ready for use will amount to 14,500,000 tons of which some 970,000 tons will be oilers.    In July 1914 the corresponding tonnage probably amounted to not less than 20 million tons. (10)from the beginning of January to the end of July 1917 the gross tonnage of merchant shipping lost by enemy action was, British  2,435,000.tons, Allies 702,000 tons, Neutrals 963,000:    total 4?1045000 tons,    July was remarkable for a considerable falling off in neutral losses, which wore for the first time since last August, lower than the Allied, while British losses rose to 66$ of the whole.    This is partly accounted for by the development of the policies of requisitioning neutral vessels and of engaging them on time-charter in compara-tively safe waters. (11) The unexpectedly large volume of imports that have been brought in in July cannot in any way warrant a relaxation of the efforts towards increased ship-building.    For the good showing that has been made was rendered possible by withdrawing ships from the service of the Army and Navy, the Colonies and Allies, and by the more economical use of whatever shipping is available.    To both these processes there is obviously a limit, and it may well be that the limit is already nearly reached.13th August, 1917.
