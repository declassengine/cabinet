iy^iii view of Lord Northcliffe;*s telegram of -August21st with regard to the possible requisitioning by the United States Government of shipping under construe-tion in American yards on British account I circulate to the Cabinet a letter which Mr.Balfour sent to the American Ambassador on august 20th on this subject.Prom this letter it is clear that unless the pledges given by Mr.Balfour when in the United States and renewed in this letter are to be repudiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government a protest such as is suggested by Lord Northcliffe cannot be made.   Mr. Balfour believes that the best chance of persuading the United States Government to allow us to keep the ships is to appeal to their sense of justice and goodwill as is done in his letter.   He holds that if the UnitedvStates have decided to take over the ships a protest will not prove effective and will only cause irritation and friction. I need not emphasize the effect that would be caused by the repudiation of pledges given by the head of the recent British mission to the United States I would therefore propose that a telegram should be sent to Lord. Northcliffe and to the Embassy giving the substance Of Mr*BaifourVs letter and the reasons why we are not prepared now to adopt a different line.(Initialled)R.G.
FOREIGN OFFICE., LONDON, 8.W.I.August 16th.1917.My dear Ambassador:-tfhen I was in the United States, the question was raised as to whether the shipping under construction in American yards on British account should he taken over by the /American Government, or should remain in the ownership of the country for which it was being built.Mr. Denman at that time Head of the Snipping Board, raised this point in the course of a Conference at which both he and General Goethals were present. Mr.Denman.made something of a grievance of the course which the British Government had adopted:- his line of argument bei:?g that British orders occupied all the yards in the United States; that American labour and American capital were absorbed in the construction of British shipping; and that, with their assistance, Britain would find herself, at the end of the war, possessed of a great mercantile marine, which the United States had built, but did not own.I took the liberty of pointing out to Mr. Denman in reply that, in ordering these ships before America entered the war, Great Britain took the only course open to her, and one which, however the question of ownership was ultimately decided, must be to the ad-vantage of all the Powers fighting against Germany. It was of the first necessity that the whole of the worlds resources in shipbuilding open to the Allies- J, shouldprivate.
&apos;Jf- w\Jshould he used in the construction of mercantile ships, and, as America was not then among the belligerents, it was only by the British Government that the necess-ary arrangements could at that time be made with private owners of shipyards in the United States.   I added that under no circumstances would the British Government enter into controversy with the State De-partment on the question of ownership, and that we placed complete reliance upon the justice and goodwill of the authorities in Washington.To this policy, we still adhere.   If the United States Government, after surveying all the circumstances of the case, think the ships that we have ordered in their yards should belong to them, we shall not think of making any protest, nor are we of opinion that -if the ships on completion are used In the war-work of the Allies,-the question qf ownership has any material bearing upon the conduct of the war.It may, however, be worth observing that, if our own policy towards our Allies were taken as a precedent, there would be no change of ownership in the case of the British ships now under construction in iimerican yards,   tie always drew a sharp distinction between ships building for Allies in our yards and ships building for neutrals: the latter were brought under the British flag and retained in Allied services for the period of the war; work on the former was dealt with exactly as if the ships were being built for British owners, and whenfinished
finished they were handed over without reserve to the country on whose account they uad been ordered.   There was, as far as I can ascertain only one exception to this general practice and in this particular case satis-factory arrangements were made.Prom the very nature of the case, the largest losses in mercantile shipping have been borne by Great Britain.   It is on Great Britain in the main that the Allies have relied for the maintenance of the sea-home traffic on which, not merely their capacity for fighting, hut their very existence depends; it is on Great Britain that the full brunt of the submarine campaign has fallen,,   Our losses iiave been heavy; and, unless we obtain the ships now under construction for us in -America, we cannot easily tide over the critical period which must elapse before our own extended shipbuilding pgogr&amp;iime hears its full fruit,We should, therefore, feel much gratification if the United States Government thought it consistent with the claims of their own national interests to allow the ships now building for us in -America to remain in their present ownership; though for the reasons given above we shall not press the point.   We rely (as I said at Washington) on their justice and goodwill.Yours sincerely,(Signed)A.J.Balfour.
COPY OF CABLE RECEIVED FROM LORD NORTHCLIFFE49775. Lord Northeliffe requests following be transmitted to C. J. Phillips, Foreign Office, for Prime Minister, Ht. Eon. A. J. Balfour, War Cabinet, and Shipping ControllerI181.   In regard to the imminent confiscation of ships1:;we aro building here I should not intervene in a matter which Is one for the Ambassador, were it not that His Excellency is away on a holiday at Woodshole, Maes.   (Stop)$he situation has reached a crisis.     We have a steamer, the &quot;Warsword-57 at the Union Iron Worts,  an Francisco.   She will be ready for delivery Saturday,, (Stop) A cargo of foodstuffs and fuel oil hat, been purchased for her and is awaiting shipment, (Stop)    The master, officers and engineers have beon sent out from England and are now waiting to join the ship. (Stop).hoyden has. asked the Shipping Board to giw-instructions to the! builders to hand her over to us, but he doubts whether&quot;&apos; the&apos; robly will be anything more than a provisional form as the main principle of ownership is still unsettled.    i number of other vessels are hearing completion regarding which a similar question will ariso almost immediately. (Stop)Mghes, Prime Minister of Australia forwarded the following protest through me on Thursday last.,   I could not reach the Ambassador as he was away.    (Stop)   To refer the matter\to the Colonial Office might havo endangered the ships for wo never know from hour to hour when the act of confiscation will take place, (Stop)      I therefore communicated Hughes1 message as follows to Colonel -House and forwarded it also to Mr. Walter Long, begins1.   These vessols not for private firms but for -Commonwealth Government,2.   That   Australia is for all practical purposes an independent nation, (Stop)3.   That it hss done great things during this War and has now a great Army at the Front.4.   That these vessels are to be used exclusively for War work, and in the Australian American Trade oarrying wheat and flour for Great Britain and Allies.5.   That to requisition these ships belonging toanother nation which has beon fighting gallantly for three years is an unfriendly aot and will be so regarded.5.   That to lease them is not an acceptable alterna-tivo and we should not agree to it,7.   That refusal by the American Government to oxompt these vessels from requisition would militate against developments of trade between the two Countries.   (Stop)Ends.I cannot bolievo that In face of an earnest and vigorous protest from H,Mo Government the U.8,A, would perpetrate an act that will-for all time stand out as an example of unfriendly commercialism. (Stop)     &apos;
2 -(49775 contd.)Hoyden has fought nobly on our behalf at Washington and he agrees with me that if it were demonstrated quite qlearly to the President that the confiscation of ships belonging to an Ally simply to secure commercial advantage te an act hardly consonant with the traditions of a highly civilised State, the President might change his mind. (Stop).Those who know him are-well aware of the importance he attaches to ethical points.     He and he alone can decide. He is beyond question greatly influ^ced by his son-in-law McAdoo who is straining.to gain every political point in view of his possibility as a presidential candidate in 1920.(Seep)whatever is done should be done quickly.    We have to fight American anti-British prejudice, powerful Geiman propaganda which has been directed towards this very question of our ships, and the ignorance at Washington of the enormous sacrifices made by the British Mercantile Marine during the War.    (Stop)     Had I any voice in affairs I would at once lodge an urgent protest with the President, (Shop)I trust I may be excused for going beyond my province but the matter will not brook delay, and as I have said, the Ambassador is 12 hours from Washington.   (Stop)If the protest fails we shall at any rate have placed the matter on record and the United States Government will not in my opinion attempt a similar thing again without grave consideration.   (Stop)I suggest that you should have before you in considering this matter the full liet of ships built and building in the U.S.A. exactly as supplied to Caird at the beginning of June by the Ministry of Shipping.   (Stop)Many difficult points will arise in the future.    I am anxious, for example, as to the retention of the German African Colonies.    (Stop)        Unless we send Smuts here to conduct proper propaganda, Americans will not understand why it is essential that we retain those Colonies.
