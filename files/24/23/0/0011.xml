CONFIDENTIAL--- WA5 CABINET.G T   1711.&quot;T^ *       MAPCH 0? UNITED 3TAT3B -i^OOPS TH30UGH LONDONMemorandum by the War Office,The following arrangements have been made for the march of United States troops through London tomorrow.They will be- brought to London by train from Bordon and liphook stations, commencing to arrive at Waterloo at about 8.15 a.m., the last train coming in at 10.59. The troops&quot; will number about 4,000,The distribution of the trains over the two routes lias been made by the railway authorities, in order to enable the usual traffic of workers coming into London to be interfered with as little as possible, but it involves a march for half the men of about 5 miles from their camp to Liphook.On arrival at Waterloo, the bulk of the men willbe marched off in successive detachments to Wellington Barracks.There they will be given a light breakfast as soon as they arriveAt about 11.20 they will commence to leave Wellington Barracksand proceed into Whitehall, via Horse Guards Parade.     There theywill be joined by the later contingents arriving after 10 atWaterloo.     Thence the route taken will be as advertised in theevening papers, namely, from Whitehall along the south side ofTrafalgar Square, Cockspur Street, St.James&apos;s Street, Piccadilly,Grosvenor Place, Grosvenor Gardens, Buckingham Palace Road, infront of Buckingham Palace, into the Green Park.   Thence, after ashort halt during vdiich they will be given light refreshments,they will proceed b^ the Mall, Admiralty Arch, Whitehall,Westminster Bridge, Westminster Bridge Eoad, to Waterloo Station.These arrangements have been mede with the fullalsoapproval of the American Authorities, who have/withdrawn theirobjections
^^xrti&amp;nsrttf&apos;^. pubJJ^nci^ifax^ti on of the arrangements being made earlier than tomorrow morring.The facts that the men are not fully equipped and armed or disciplined as soldiers, that they do not profess to he more than Railway Construction and Operating Staffs organised into regiments, and that they have only recently come off a sea voyage,, have, at the request of the American military authorities, been privately notified to newspaper Editors for their information.   This, it is hoped, will forestall any criticism as to a   lack of soldier-like appearance which these troops may display.It has also been explained to the press that the short-ness cf the time available - seeing &quot;that the men are to go to Prance wftth as little delay as possible &apos;* and also the desire of the American authorities to avoid a too early publicity, have rendered it impossible to make the arrangements more elaborate,The facts also that the men have not yet got into training, and that half of them will have to march four or five miles the other end, have made it necessary to curtail the march in London as much as possible.     As it is, the arrangements have necessitated the first contingents leaving Liphook at 6,55 a.m. while on the return journey the first to leave London will &quot;be by a train starting at 2,15 p.muThe press have been kept fully informed from the very first of the fact that these troops would march through London and they also have been made acquainted with the arrangements as they have developed.In
In particular, the -American correspondents in Loiidon were told in advance that the march was to he held, and they had been prcmided facilities for cabling messages to their country.Arrangements are being made with the local civil authorities for so much display of flags esc., as may be possible in the Short time at clieir disposal.WAR OFFICE,    - -14th August, 1917
