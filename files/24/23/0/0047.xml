-Victoria 8240.Telegrams:-Growmore, Sowest, London.BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.To avoid delay, address all communications to :  The Director General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)15th August, 1917,Sir,I beg to submit the following report on the work of the Food Production Department for the week ended the 14thAugust, 1917:-The recent unfavourable weather, which has caused awide-spread laying of crops, will, it is feared, greatly reduce the yield of the present harvest in parts of the Eastern and South-Eastern counties.    Reports as to the harvest prospects from these districts are very discouraging, but should fine and settled weather be experienced from now on, the general results may prove to be better than are now feared.     The persistent rains have also checked for the time being the demands of farmers for additional labour.     The need for men who can use the scythe or bagging hook, for harvesting badly laid corn, has increased, and in the Southern counties, a scheme has already been initiated for teaching unskilled men this work.possession of 46 acres of rich grazing land in the Pevensey Level which have not been grazed for some years.     In the present year the hay has not even been cut, and the hay stacks of 1915 and 1916 are still rotting on the spot unthatched.     The land is seldom visited by the owner-occupier who resides at a distance. Yorkshire, West Riding.       On the application of Messrs. Major Bros, the Committee have directed them to plough up a further 80 acresLOCAL ORGANISATION.Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.Sussex East,The Committee have been authorised to take
of their farm at Reedness.     An earlier direction to plough up grass land on this farm was one of the first instances of the application of Regulation 2M.In Cambridgeshire and Hampshire the Committees have made arrangements for the breaking up of selected pieces of grass land belonging to a number of stud farms and training stables in the Newmarket district and on the Hampshire downs.Land of which possession has been taken,Owing to the great pressure of work on the Executive Committees the Department have refrained from calling for detailed statistics of their transactions, but arrangements are now being made to obtain complete information as to all cases in which Executive Committees have taken possession of land under the Defence of the Realm Regulation.Preliminary statements prepared from information in the possession of the Department shew that in 134 cases possession has been taken of holdings, or parts of holdings, exceeding 20 acres, on the ground that the land was not being cultivated so as to increase as far as practicable the food supply of the country.   The total area comprised was 17,891 acres.     Of those cases 40; comprising 7781 acres, relate to land which was in the occupation of the ownersj   and in the remaining 94 oases, comprising 10,110 acres, the land was in the hands of tenants.Determination of Tenancies.Records have also been compiled of the cases in which it has become necessary to serve notices to determine tenancies in consequence of the bad farming of the tenant.     In 130 cases, comprising 11,372 acres, orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies, and. in 28 cases, comprising 1863 acres tenancies have been determined by the Board themselves.Drainage of Lands.In addition to areas already mentioned in these reports, the East Riding Committee are undertaking work on the Eellasize- 2 r-
Drain;   the West Riding Committee are clearing the drains on Oowdall Common in the exercise of the unused powers given by an old Inclosure Award;   they are also undertaking work at Woodhouse and at Nun Monkton.     A further scheme is being carried out in Merionethshire.     The Essex Committee are arranging with the Commissioners of Dengie Level for the repair of sea walls between the estuaries of the Blackwater and the Crouch.Rabbits   Order,Action under this Order is reported from Hampshire, East Suffolk and the West Riding.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).Particulars received from 1,052 Boroughs or Urban District Councils show that 193,362 applications have been made for plots, and 174,533 plots, containing a total area of 12,910 acres, have been provided under the Order.HORTICULTURAL SECTION. Fruit and Vegetable Bottling.     142 demonstrations have been given during the week in different parts of the countryi making a total of 1,398 demonstrations provided by this Department.The total number of glass jars dispatched last week was 151,488, making a total of 902,072;   the balance remaining to be dispatched is P.91.370.Potato Spraying.      During the week, cases of disease (late blight) have been reported from Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Hereford-shire, Carnarvonshire, and some of the Western London Suburbs, but the only districts in which the disease appears to be spreading to any very serious extent are Somerset, Devon and Hampshire.The evidence collected by the officers of the Department shews conclusively that where disease is present, the damage is markedly greater on unsprayed than it is on sprayed crops.     In late blight districts, the water logged condition of the soil has been responsible for a considerable amount of rotting at the base
of the haulm, and this is often mistaken for evidence of late blight.Preserving Fruit and Vegetables.        Owing on the one hand to the large plum crops, and on the other to market congestion, very large and serious waste of plums and other perishable fruit is occurring.     Much of the waste is due to inadequate organisation, and more of it occurs In Covent Garden than in any other of the London Markets.     Urgent representations have been made to the Ministry of Food with the object of securing better organisation of the marketing of such produce.In order to assist in the prevention of this waste, every effort has been made to Instal as many Pulping Stations as possible.     Stations started work on August 13th at Cheltenham (2 units), Maidstone (4 units) and Pershore (2 units).Arrangements have also been made for Pulping Stations to commence work next week at Marden in Kent (1 unit)j Sitting-bourne (3 units) and Totnes ( 4 units).     By August 27th a further station will have been installed at Cambridge (2 units). Each unit is capable of dealing with 15 tons of fruit per day.For dealing with the Damson crop (from the middle of September), Pulping Stations are being installed at Chester, Budeley and Newport, Salop.     Stations for apple pulp and apple-jelly making are in course of installation at Widmore, Bridgewater, Creditdn, Plymouth, Marston Magna, and Long Ashton,Messrs. Cadbury have, at the Instigation of the Department, also established a Pulping Station at Bournville.Arrangements for the Installation of Drying Stations are in progress, and an account of the arrangements will be given in a subsequent report.
Potatoes for Bread-making - Baking tests are being carried out to ascertain the best method by means of which whole potatoes can be used in bread-making, and for this work the Ministry of Pood has put the services of Mr. Kelsey, an experienced miller with a thorough knowledge of baking, at the disposal of the Department.   Mr. Kelsey is now co-operating with Dr. Campbell, an officer of the Horticultural Division of this Department, in carrying out the necessary tests.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Breaking up Grassland - The enquiry into the results of breaking up grassland in 1916-1917 has now been completed, and a pamphlet on the subjeet is in course of preparation.   So far over 300 replies have been received from 55 counties.   In view of the difficulties attending the work last spring, the inexperience of many farmers in breaking up old grass, and the unskilled labour that had often to be employed, the results secured have been very satisfactory.   It has been argued, in some influential quarters, during tho past few months that it is hopeless to attempt to plough out old grass in the expecta-tion of adding to the nation1s food.   The experience of 1917 does not support this contention;   for every failure reported there have been four successes, and though some of the failures cannot be accounted for, most of them are due to reasons which further experience should enable farmers to avoid.   The failures occurred chiefly in the south and east, and are mostly attributed to wireworm;   but much of the damage put down to this cause is primarily due to the drying out of the newly ploughed soil through lack of proper tillage.   Wireworm are most destructive in loose, open soils and the best remedy is thorough consolidation of the land.   The usual explanation of success in breaking up grass land given by correspondents is
thorough pressing, or heavy rolling.     The testimony from all parts of the country as to the effectiveness of a firm seed-bed is very striking.     The benefits due to consolidation vrere specially noticeable this year, because of the long period of dry weather in early summer.     Differences of opinion are expressed on the subject of manuring.     Ordinarily, newly ploughed land should not require manure, and the limited supply of fertilisers available should be reserved for old arable land; but the experience of last season shows that there arc a fair number of cases in which manures proved useful,LABOURLabour troubles which have recently caused anxiety in Shropshire and Suffolk have been satisfactorily settled during the week.Soldier Labour. The number of soldiers supplied by 3bhe War Office up to the present for the purpose of carrying out the Departments 1918 Programme falls far below the number which the Cabinet ordered to be supplied.     Had the War Office been able to carry out the Cabinet instructions an additional 25,000 skilled and 10,000 unskilled men for the purposes of the 1918 programme would have been made available since July 1st,     Reports received from the Departments Commissioners shew that only about 1,300 skilled and 1,500 unskilled men have so far arrived at the Distribution Centres.     They are being examined with a view to ascertaining their previous experience etc., and suitable men are being reserved for the purpose of being trained in tho various special branches of agricultural work for which men are required, such as, tractor driving, steam ploughing, threshing tackle work, horse ploughing, etc,Horses. Orders for the issue of 638 horses to Agricultural Executive Committees under the Departments scheme for increased cultivation have so far been sent to Remount Depots,     The horses Will go out in teams, each in charge of a soldier ploughman, or a
ploughman lent from tho Metropolitan Police Force.     About 120 teams have commenced work.Prisoners of War.   Two new schemes for the employment of prisoners of war have been sent to the War Office during the week.     In the case of three of the existing camps additional men have been asked for.     The total number of prisoners supplied up to date, and actually at work in agriculture, is as follows:-In Agricultural Camps............ 1,881,Employed from other Camps........     664a2,545.Released Aliens employed inAgriculture........... 1,200TOTAL 5,745W0MEN&apos;S BRANCH.The position in rogard to the obtaining of employment forwomen who have enrolled under the National Service Scheme for workon the land remains the same as last week.     Returns received shewthat 6,452 women have been accepted as National Service Volunteers,and 10,106 rejected.     Of the number accepted, 6,359 are accounted  1for as follows:- : jIn Instruction Centres.............. 1,183On Farm work........................ 4,446Waiting for references to be placedin Training Centres............... 213Waiting for employment in Depots.... 242Waiting in their own homes.......... 275Returns have been received from the Women&apos;s WarAgricultural Committees respecting the employment on farms ofwomen who are not National Service Volunteers.     These returns(which are regarded as giving the minimum figures) shew that inEngland, 41,736 women are working whole time on farms, and 63,231part-time.     In Wales (for which, however, particulars arc notavailable from three counties), 2,639 women are returned as workingwhole time, and 9,033 part-time.     The total number of women landworkers in England and Wales exclusive of National Service womenis, therefore, 116,639,
MACHINERY AND IMPLEMENTS. The total number of tractors now consigned to Executive Committees in England and Wales Is 799, eleven additional tractors . having been dispatched during the week.     Immediate delivery is expected of a further 174 tractors, and these have already been allocated to the different counties.SUPPLIES. Supplies Sub-Committees.        Inspectors have visited twenty counties, and discussed supplies with the Committees and officers with good results.     Representations have been made to those Executives which have not yet appointed Sub-Committees.     The number of Approved Agents so far recognised is small, but vigorous steps are being taken, in all the counties visited by inspectors to hasten the necessary appointments.Sulphate of Ammonia.     33,000 tons have been sold by the direct action of the Distribution Committee between June 1st and July 31st over and above the quantity which merchants and farmers have ordered direct from makers.     Orders come in at the rate of about 200 tons per day.Superphosphates.      The order fixing prices on a sliding scale will probably be issued by the Ministry of Munitions within a week. It is feared that the arrival of phosphate rock is very slow and far below the amount decided upon by the Cabinet. Basic Slag.      A press notice is being issued exhorting farmers to place orders with their usual merchants at once so that the prospective shortage may be more accurately defined. Binder Twine.     Arrangements which appear to be satisfactory are about to be settled with manufacturers by the Ministry of Munitions. Cereal Seeds Generally.   The absence of a definite pronouncement by the Pood Controller regarding transactions in seed wheat and other cereals is giving rise to the most serious inconvenience. This is made clear by correspondents from all parts of the country who, through misapprehension, are disposed to attribute the delay-8-
4&apos; i (jto the Pood Production Department.Seed Wheat.   Of the seed of the 1916 crop purchased by the Department 1054 quarters have been sold, leaving approximately 4,000 quarters still in hand.The acreage of wheat of the selected varieties of the 1917 crop already passed for purchase after inspection is as follows :-Variety. AcrestWilhelmina 450Little Joss 2,398Browick 851Victor 5,159TOTAL 6,838The inspection has not yet been completed and it is probable that a total of not less than 10,000 acres, yielding approximately 40,000 quarters, will be selected.The weather during the past fortnight has been very injurious to the prospects of the crop for seed purposes.     The Inspection Committee report that if unfavourable weather continues probably one third of the wheat selected will prove unsuitable for seed purposes.     The Advisory Committee have recommended that seed wheat of the 1917 crop be graded according to the ascertained percentage of purity and that it be sold in different grades at prices not exceeding 15/-, 20/- and 25/- per quarter above the maximum price fixed for milling wheat.Seeds Other than Cerealsfl     Further steps are being taken by the Department with a view to securing facilities for the transport across America of seeds intended for use in the United Kingdom. The difficulty of obtaining early information regarding the consignments to be dispatched to British merchants by the various
growers in the United States of America and in Canada has made it necessary to suggest a method of identifying the packages by marking them in a uay vrhich can be readily recognised.     The&apos; circumstances are being brought to the notice of the Foreign Office &amp;nd it is hoped that certain growers in the United States of America may be authorised to use an approved form of stencil for marking packages containing seed for shipment to the United Kingdom *I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E, Prothero, M0P,President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
