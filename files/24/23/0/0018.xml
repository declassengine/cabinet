Confidential.MEMORANDUM  BY  MINISTER  OP LABOUR.NATIONAL SERVICE AND EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.In accordance -with, the decision of the War Cabinet Committee of .8th August, the work of recruiting men for the Army is to be transferred to the National Service Department. Arrangements of an elaborate kind now exist between the Recruiting Department of the War Office, the National Service Department and the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour for the provision of substitutes for men released for the Army : these arrangements must, in any event, be largely re-cast in conse-quence of the transfer of recruiting to the National Service Department, and I am strongly of opinion that the present opportunity ought to be taken to get rid of the overlapping and confusion between the National Service Department and the Employ-ment Exchanges, which has hitherto hampered the work of supplying labour for national requirements.There are obvious objections to any arrangement under which a Department charged with recruiting men for the Army also administers a scheme of voluntary national service. If any such arrangement were adopted considerable risk would be run of incurring charges of industrial compulsion, and any suspicion of this would be seriously detrimental to the prospects of success of the scheme. Even apart from these objections, however, I think there are very strong reasons why a change in the present arrangements with regard to the supply of labour is essential.Very serious difficulties have been caused owing to the efforts of two different Departments to do the same work, and these difficulties must continue to exist if a change is not made. Several attempts have been made to divide the work of supplying labour between the National Service Department and the Employment Exchanges, and to deiine the functions to be performed by each, but these attempts have met with no success, and, in my opinion, they were in the nature of things foredoomed to failure. The work of ascertaining the demand for labour, of procuring a supply from whatever source, and of bringing supply and demand together is essentially indivisible, and no separation of functions between different Departments for the performance of this work is really practicable. The attempted separation of functions between the National Service Department and the Employment Exchanges has not been, and could not be, a real one, and has resulted in a state of confusion which I gravely deplore. The only remedy is to assign the whole of the work and the responsibility to a single Department which must clearly be the Ministry of Labour.The evils of unco-ordinated action on the recruiting of labour w-ere recently illustrated by the serious consequences which arose from the independent efforts of Government Departments to obtain labour from abroad, as a result of which the Cabinet, on 22nd June last, decided that the Ministry of Labour should become definitely responsible for dealing with the recruiting and importation of alien labour from abroad. Similar evils follow from lack of co-ordination in dealing with the labour supply at home, and the same principle ought to apply to this part of the problem.T do not think I am doing any injustice to the National Service Department when 1 say that it is clearly less qualified to undertake the work now in question than is the Employment Department, which alone possesses the necessary staff, premises, and organisation. There is, it is true, the allegation (advanced in particular by the Labour Advisory Committee of the National Service Department) that the Employ-ment Exchanges are unpopular with organised labour, and that this unpopularity precludes their use as the basis of a National Service organisation. This is obviously an important point, and with regard to it I would say that there has, in the past, been undoubtedly a suspicion of Employment Exchanges in the minds of certain sections of organised labour. I should be sorry to think, however, that the steps Avhich I have taken to remove ^ grounds of suspicion and, in particular to associate with the Exchanges Committees representative of employers and workmen, have not gone averv long way to remove this feeling, and in any event I am satisfied that there is no real ground for anticipating that organised labour would refuse to work with the Employment Exchanges in National Service work.   The Exchanges already work inu  (33)3748   Pk 146   52   8/17   E &amp; S A
the closest touch with organised labour iu many ways, and I have met with no difficulty in forming Committees, both central and local, based &quot;entirely in the former case, and partly in the latter, on representatives of organised labour. The Central Committees are representative of organised labour in-the building, engineering, and shipbuilding, and textile trades, and others are in course of formation ; three Com-rnittees already formed contain 34 members who were all nominated by their Associations, and whose title to be accepted as representative of organised labour in their trade admits of&apos;no question.   (Lists of the members are annexed.)The arrangements for constituting from 200 to 300 local Committees in connec-tion with the various Exchanges throughout the country have now reached an advanced stage, and in response to the invitations addressed to organised labour to nominate representatives for these Committees I have received no replies indicative of a refusal to co-operate with the Exchanges.As a further illustration of the present point, I may mention that in one district, the North-West Riding of Yorkshire, 19 of these Committees have been in existence for a considerable time. These Committees deal particularly with the provision of substitutes for men to be released for the Army, and though they do all their work through the Exchanges, they have been accepted by the National Service Depart-ment in place of their own Committees which the National Service Department have, therefore, not established in that district. This use of the Exchanges for National Service purposes has not evoked any manifestation of hostility in the North-West Riding of Yorkshire, which is by no means a district in which labour is unorganised; in fact the work of these Committees has been so successful that it confirms me in my belief that the only proper course is to extend the same system all over the country.I may add that when the interviewing of National Service Volunteers was being performed by Emploj-ment Exchange Officers on behalf of the National Service Department, a strong point was made of the alleged disinclination of volunteers to attend at an Exchange, and it was,&apos; therefore, arranged that each volunteer to be interviewed in a town where there was an Exchange should be given the option of attending at some place (generally the Town Hall) other than the Exchange. Of 114,000 volunteers so interviewed, three-fourths attended at the Exchange, and only one-fourth elsewhere. It should not, of course, be assumed that even those who did not attend at the Exchange had any objection to doing so, as it is equally probable that they found the time for attendance at the Town Hall (usually Saturday afternoon) to be more convenient; but in any event these figures dispose of any contention that National Service Volunteers would not come forward because of any objection, to attendance at an Exchange.1 believe, therefore, that the fear of opposition from organised labour, if the work now performed by the National Service Department, in respect of the supply of labour is transferred to the Employment Exchanges, is without real foundation. I cannot conceive any other objection to the transfer, the advantages of which, from the point of view of efficiency, are obvious and indisputable, and I, therefore, urge as strongly as possible that the transfer should be decided upon and should take effect at the earliest possible date.13th August 1917.
