G.T.-174917 A R    .0 A ii I H.3 &quot;figrTUATlUP A? APXIIul; GEL.Copy of letter from Lir. Arm:&apos; t g t ead -t.. ;r epr es en tat ive ofHudson&quot;s Bay Company at Aichange!-- dated.16th July.7 1S17 ,Gentlemen,I beg to confirm my letter Ho, H,A.A* Ho, 29, of which I enclose copy.Since I last wrote to you, the arrangements for the discharging of lighters with high explosives hove been ameliorated, owing to the pressure brought about by the Allied local representative, and. consequently the situation has been relieved to a certain extent.     It is fortunate, however, that generally speaking the tonnage coming to Archangel is considerably less than lest year, as otherwise there would be a complete stoppage of work.The labour question is Still unsettled, and on Saturday and Sunday week, work in the harbour was totally suspended and a great demonstration of all labourers from Archangel and surroundings was organised.     About 40,000 men and women from all parts assembled in Archangel, and an endless procession with hundrods of red flags with &quot;end-tho-v;arrt inscriptions, all more or less of an extreme socialistic tendency, paraded tho streets.   Fortunately the weather conditions were such that their energy received a eon-siderable damping, and the masses dispersed inoro or less drenched not to re-assemble againj and took up their work peacefully the following morning,toThe local authorities, not knowing/what excesses the demonstration might lead; wore very nervous concerning tho considerable alcohol supplies, and requested us to make arrange-ments for the steamer ST. THOiviAS to leave the port s&amp; soon as possible,-3ince the demonstration considerable numbers of labourers have left Archangel,-&apos; partly owing to the lack of sufficient employment and the food difficulties^ and partly to do the so necessary agricultural harvest work on the land,, notwithstanding ell&apos; these difficulties, we -jyero getting on comparatively well with the work of our steamers, &quot;/hen suddenly we were informed oft;Monday afternoon that we would have to stop the loading of wheat immediately, as the export of all wheat is forbidden, **nd the demand was even madn that the wheat already loaded in the nPL0H3&quot; and &quot;TniSXTS&quot; should bo discharged. Mr.. IioBourgeois, however, -succeeded in getting permission for these two steamers to leave with the cargo loaded, but he was requested by the Government to get the vessels out of the harbour as quickly as possible, only giving them the additional cargo to keep tho wheat from&apos;shifting.This action does not appoer to have been directed by the provisional Government, but has been forced on the local author!-ties by one Committee of Soldiers and Labourers, who were urged on &amp;y the general public opinion fearing that the Northern provinces
-2-H of Russia were not sufficiently supplied with food.   It is difficult to say, at the moment, if wheat shipments will ha resumed again in case supplies for this district are guaran-teed.     In general, however, the extraordinary cost Of living and scarcity of food has made the Russian population vary antagonistic towards the export of any foodstuffs from Russia, and the fact of this export has certainly not added to the popularity of foreigners In this port,$To illustrate the temperament of the people, v;e had yesterday afternoon quite a small excitement with regard to the despatch of the &quot;FLORS&quot;.     After all the necessary documents and official permit for leaving the port had been received from the authorities, the pilot refused to go on board saying he had instructions not to take the steamer out of the harbour.     On telephoning the port authorities, we .,-are informed by the Assistant Chief of the Port, in the absence of his Chief, that they would not permit this steamer to leavo, and that if she attempted to go out the fortress had instructions to fire on her.     The matter was again taken up by the French Consulate with the Government, and at 1act final Instructions were issued to the port authorities, and we were able to eend the &quot;FLOPS&quot; out to the Bar last night.Generally speaking, since the last offensive of the Russians, the situation seems &quot;to be more hopeful, although the difficulties which the Provisional Government have still to overcome to enforce their authority are tremendous, but it is certainly a good sign that everybody, with the exception of the socialistic elements which to my belief Is certainly influenced by German intrigue, is trying their best to support the authority of the Provisional Government.For the port of Archangel, and the work in the harbour It is very unfortunate that the Assistant Governor and head of the Russian Transport Department, Captain Str&amp;howsky, has been removed from his post owing to intrigues. Captain Strahowsky has held this position practically since the outbreak of the war, with great ability, and the change now will be certain to have an adverse effect on the general work at Archangel.The general rise in the cost of living in Russia is enormous, and has more than doubled since last year.   For your information I am enclosing a table comparing the prices of 1916 and 1917, whioh shows an approximate average increase of living amounting to about 500$ and even then the prioes of 1915 in most cases show a considerable Increase to pre-war prices.Yours faithfully,(Sgd)   H.
